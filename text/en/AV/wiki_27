<text>The National Order of the Legion of Honour ( ), formerly the Imperial Order of the Legion of Honour (), is the highest and most prestigious French order of merit, both military and civil. Currently comprising of five classes, it was established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte, and it has been retained (with occasional slight alterations) by all later French governments and regimes.

The order&#x27;s motto is &quot;&quot; (&quot;Honour and Fatherland&quot;); its seat is the Palais de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur next to the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, on the left bank of the Seine in Paris. Since 1 February 2023, the Order&#x27;s grand chancellor has been retired General François Lecointre, who succeeded fellow retired General Benoît Puga in office.

The order is divided into five degrees of increasing distinction: &#x27; ([[Knight]]),&#x27; (Officer), &#x27; ([[Commander (order)|Commander]]),&#x27; (Grand Officer) and &quot;&quot; (Grand Cross).

==History==
===Consulate===
During the French Revolution, all of the French orders of chivalry were abolished and replaced with weapons of honour. It was the wish of Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul, to create a reward to commend civilians and soldiers. From this wish was instituted a , a body of men that was not an order of chivalry, for Napoleon believed that France wanted a recognition of merit rather than a new system of nobility. However, the did use the organization of the old French orders of chivalry, for example, the . The insignia of the bear a resemblance to those of the , which also used a red ribbon.

Napoleon originally created this award to ensure political loyalty. The organization would be used as a façade to give political favours, gifts, and concessions. The was loosely patterned after a Roman legion, with legionaries, officers, commanders, regional &quot;cohorts&quot; and a grand council. The highest rank was not a Grand Cross but a (Grand Eagle), a rank that wore the insignia common to a Grand Cross. The members were paid, the highest of them extremely generously:

* 5,000 francs to a ,
* 2,000 francs to a ,
* 1,000 francs to an ,
* 250 francs to a .

Napoleon famously declared, &quot;You call these baubles, well, it is with baubles that men are led... Do you think that you would be able to make men fight by reasoning? Never. That is good only for the scholar in his study. The soldier needs glory, distinctions, rewards.&quot; This has been often quoted as &quot;It is with such baubles that men are led.&quot; Napoleon was also occasionally noted after a battle to ask who the bravest man in a regiment was, and upon the regiment declaring the individual, the Emperor would take the Legion d&#x27;Honneur from his own coat and pin it on the chest of the man.

The order was the first modern order of merit. Under the monarchy, such orders were often limited to Roman Catholics, all knights had to be noblemen, and military decorations were restricted to officers. The , however, was open to men of all ranks and professions; only merit or bravery counted. The new legionnaire had to be sworn into the . All previous orders were Christian, or shared a clear Christian background, whereas the is a secular institution. The badge of the has five arms.

===First Empire===
In a decree issued on the (30 January 1805), a grand decoration was instituted. This decoration, a cross on a large sash and a silver star with an eagle, symbol of the Napoleonic Empire, became known as the (Grand Eagle), and later in 1814 as the (big sash, literally &quot;big ribbon&quot;). After Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French in 1804 and established the Napoleonic nobility in 1808, award of the gave right to the title of &quot;Knight of the Empire&quot; (). The title was made hereditary after three generations of grantees.

Napoleon had dispensed 15 golden collars of the among his family and his senior ministers. This collar was abolished in 1815.

Although research is made difficult by the loss of the archives, it is rumoured that three women who fought with the army were decorated with the order: Virginie Ghesquière, Marie-Jeanne Schelling and a nun, Sister Anne Biget.

The was prominent and visible in the French Empire. The Emperor always wore it, and the fashion of the time allowed for decorations to be worn most of the time. The king of Sweden therefore declined the order; it was too common in his eyes. Napoleon&#x27;s own decorations were captured by the Prussians and were displayed in the (armoury) in Berlin until 1945. Today, they are in Moscow.

===Restoration of the Bourbon King of France in 1814===

Louis XVIII changed the appearance of the order, but it was not abolished. To have done so would have angered the 35,000 to 38,000 members. The images of Napoleon and his eagle were removed and replaced by the image of King Henry IV, the popular first king of the Bourbon line. Three Bourbon replaced the eagle on the reverse of the order. A king&#x27;s crown replaced the imperial crown. In 1816, the grand cordons were renamed grand crosses and the legionnaires became knights. The king decreed that the commandants were now commanders. The became the second-ranking order of knighthood of the French monarchy, after the Order of the Holy Spirit.

===July Monarchy===

Following the overthrow of the Bourbons in favour of King Louis Philippe I of the House of Orléans, the Bourbon monarchy&#x27;s orders were once again abolished and the was restored in 1830 as the paramount decoration of the French nation. The insignia were drastically altered; the cross now displayed tricolour flags. In 1847, there were 47,000 members.

===Second Republic===
Yet another revolution in Paris (in 1848) brought a new republic (the second) and a new design to the . A nephew of the founder, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, was elected president and he restored the image of his uncle on the crosses of the order. In 1852, the first recorded woman, Angélique Duchemin, an old revolutionary of the 1789 uprising against the absolute monarchy, was admitted into the order. On 2 December 1851, President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte staged a coup d&#x27;état with the help of the armed forces. He made himself Emperor of the French exactly one year later on 2 December 1852, after a successful plebiscite.

===Second Empire===
An Imperial crown was added. During Napoleon III&#x27;s reign, the first American was admitted: Thomas Wiltberger Evans, dentist of Napoleon III.

===Third Republic===
In 1870, the defeat of the French Imperial Army in the Franco-Prussian War brought the end of the Empire and the creation of the Third Republic (1871–1940). As France changed, the changed as well. The crown was replaced by a laurel and oak wreath. In 1871, during the Paris Commune uprising, the , headquarters of the , was burned to the ground in fierce street combats; the archives of the order were lost.

In the second term of President Jules Grévy, which started in 1885, newspaper journalists brought to light the trafficking of Grévy&#x27;s son-in-law, Daniel Wilson, in the awarding of decorations of the . Grévy was not accused of personal participation in this scandal, but he was slow to accept his indirect political responsibility, which caused his eventual resignation on 2 December 1887.

During World War I, some 55,000 decorations were conferred, 20,000 of which went to foreigners. The large number of decorations resulted from the new posthumous awards authorised in 1918. Traditionally, membership in the could not be awarded posthumously.

===Fourth and Fifth Republics===
The establishment of the Fourth Republic in 1946 brought about the latest change in the design of the Legion of Honour. The date &quot;1870&quot; on the obverse was replaced by a single star. No changes were made after the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.

==Organisation==
===Legal status and leadership===
The Legion of Honour is a national order of France, meaning a public incorporated body. The Legion is regulated by a civil law code, the &quot;Code of the Legion of Honour and of the Military Medal&quot;. While the President of the French Republic is the Grand Master of the order, day-to-day running is entrusted to the Grand Chancery (&quot;&quot;).

====Grand Master====
Since the establishment of the Legion, the Grand Master of the order has always been the Emperor, King or President of France. President Emmanuel Macron therefore became the Grand Master of the Legion on 14 May 2017.

The Grand Master appoints all other members of the order, on the advice of the French government. The Grand Master&#x27;s insignia is the Grand Collar of the Legion. The President of the Republic, as Grand Master of the order, receives the Collar as part of his investiture, but the Grand Masters have not worn the Collar since Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing.

====The Grand Chancery====
The Grand Chancery is headed by the Grand Chancellor (), usually a retired general, as well as the Secretary-General (), a civilian administrator.
* Grand Chancellor: General François Lecointre (since 2023)
* Secretary-General: Julien Le Gars (since 2023)

The Grand Chancery also regulates the National Order of Merit and the (Military Medal). There are several structures funded by and operated under the authority of the Grand Chancery, like the Legion of Honour Schools () and the Legion of Honour Museum (). The Legion of Honour Schools are élite boarding schools in and in the forest of . Study there is restricted to daughters, granddaughters, and great-granddaughters of members of the order, the or the .

===Membership===
There are five classes in the Legion of Honour:

* (Knight): minimum 20 years of public service or 25 years of professional activity with &quot;eminent merits&quot;
* (Officer): minimum 8 years in the rank of 
* (Commander): minimum 5 years in the rank of 
* (Grand Officer): minimum 3 years in the rank of 
* (Grand Cross): minimum 3 years in the rank of 

The &quot;eminent merits&quot; required to be awarded the order require the flawless performance of one&#x27;s trade as well as doing more than ordinarily expected, such as being creative, zealous and contributing to the growth and well-being of others.

The order has a maximum quota of 75 Grand Cross, 250 Grand Officers, 1,250 Commanders, 10,000 Officers, and 113,425 (ordinary) Knights. the actual membership was 67 Grand Cross, 314 Grand Officers, 3,009 Commanders, 17,032 Officers and 74,384 Knights. Appointments of veterans of World War II, French military personnel involved in the North African Campaign and other foreign French military operations, as well as wounded soldiers, are made independently of the quota.

Members convicted of a felony ( in French) are automatically dismissed from the order. Members convicted of a misdemeanour ( in French) can be dismissed as well, although this is not automatic.

Wearing the decoration of the without having the right to do so is a serious offence. Wearing the ribbon or rosette of a foreign order is prohibited if that ribbon is mainly red, like the ribbon of the Legion of Honour.

In theory, French military personnel in uniform are required to salute other military members in uniform wearing the medal (but not the ribbon), whatever the rank and the military rank of the bearer. In practice, however, this is rarely done.

There is not a single, complete list of all the members of the Legion in chronological order. The number is estimated at one million, including about 2,900 Knights Grand Cross.

====French nationals====
French nationals, men and women, can be received into the , for &quot;eminent merit&quot; () in military or civil life. In practice, in current usage, the order is conferred on entrepreneurs, high-level civil servants, scientists, artists, including famous actors and actresses, sport champions, and others with connections in the executive. Members of the French Parliament cannot receive the order, except for valour in war, and ministers are not allowed to nominate their accountants.

Until 2008, French nationals could only enter the Legion of Honour at the class of (Knight). To be promoted to a higher class, one had to perform new eminent services in the interest of France and a set number of years had to pass between appointment and promotion. This was however amended in 2008 when entry became possible at Officer, Commander and Grand Officer levels, as a recognition of &quot;extraordinary careers&quot; (). In 2009, Simone Veil became the first person to enter the Order at Grand Officer level. Veil was a member of the , a former Health Minister and President of the European Parliament, as well as an Auschwitz survivor. She was promoted to Grand Cross in 2012.

Every year at least five recipients decline the award. Even if they refuse to accept it, they are still included in the order&#x27;s official membership. The composers Maurice Ravel and Charles Koechlin, for example, declined the award when it was offered to them.

====Non-French recipients====
While membership in the is technically restricted to French nationals, foreign nationals who have served France or the ideals it upholds may receive the honour. Foreign nationals who live in France are subject to the same requirements as the French. Foreign nationals who live abroad may be awarded a distinction of any rank or dignity in the . Foreign heads of state and their spouses or consorts of monarchs are made Grand Cross as a courtesy. American and British veterans who served in either World War on French soil, or during the 1944 campaigns to liberate France, may be eligible for appointment as Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, provided they were still living when the honour was approved.

====Collective awards====
Collective appointments can be made to cities, institutions or companies. A total of 64 settlements in France have been decorated, as well as six foreign cities: Liège in 1914, Belgrade in 1920, Luxembourg City in 1957, Volgograd (the World War II &#x27;Stalingrad&#x27;) in 1984, Algiers in 2004, and London in 2020. French towns display the decoration in their municipal coat of arms.

Organisations to receive the honour include the French Red Cross (), the (Abbey of Notre-Dame des Dombes), the French National Railway Company (), the (Prefecture of Police of Paris), and various (National (Elite) Colleges) and other educational establishments.

====Military awards====
The military distinctions () are awarded for bravery () or for service.

* award for extreme bravery: the is awarded jointly with a mention in dispatches. This is the top valour award in France. It is rarely awarded, mainly to soldiers who have died in battle.
* award for service: the is awarded without any citation.

=====French service-members=====
For active-duty commissioned officers, the Legion of Honour award for service is achieved after 20 years of meritorious service, having been awarded the rank of of the . Bravery awards lessen the time needed for the award—in fact decorated servicemen become directly chevaliers of the , skipping the . NCOs almost never achieve that award, except for the most heavily decorated service members.

=====Collective military awards=====
Collective appointments can be made to military units. In the case of a military unit, its flag is decorated with the insignia of a knight, which is a different award from the . Twenty-one schools, mainly schools providing reserve officers during the World Wars, were awarded the Légion d&#x27;Honneur. Foreign military units can be decorated with the order, such as the U.S. Military Academy.

The Flag or Standard of the following units was decorated with the Cross of a Knight of the Legion of Honour:

* 1st Foreign Regiment
* 1st Marine Artillery Regiment

==Classes and insignia==
The order has had five levels since the reign of King Louis XVIII, who restored the order in 1815. Since the reform, the following distinctions have existed:

* Three ranks:
** (Knight): badge worn on left breast suspended from ribbon
** (Officer): badge worn on left breast suspended from a ribbon with a rosette
** (Commander): badge around neck suspended from ribbon necklet
* Two dignities:
** (Grand Officer): badge worn on left breast suspended from a ribbon (Officer), with star displayed on right breast
** (Grand Cross), formerly , , or : the highest level; badge affixed to sash worn over the right shoulder, with star displayed on left breast

Due to the order&#x27;s long history, and the remarkable fact that it has been retained by all subsequent governments and regimes since the First Empire, the order&#x27;s design has undergone many changes. Although the basic shape and structure of the insignia has remained generally the same, the hanging device changed back and forth and France itself swung back and forth between republic and monarchy. The central disc in the centre has also changed to reflect the political system and leadership of France at the time. As each new regime came along the design was altered to become politically correct for the time, sometimes even changed multiple times during one historical era.

The &quot;badge&quot; of the is shaped as a five-armed &quot;Maltese Asterisk&quot;, using five distinctive &quot;arrowhead&quot; shaped arms inspired by the Maltese Cross. The badge is rendered in gilt (in silver for chevalier) enameled white, with an enameled laurel and oak wreath between the arms. The obverse central disc is in gilt, featuring the head of Marianne, surrounded by the legend on a blue enamel ring. The reverse central disc is also in gilt, with a set of crossed , surrounded by the Légion&#x27;s motto (&#x27;Honour and Fatherland&#x27;) and its foundation date on a blue enamel ring. The badge is suspended by an enameled laurel and oak wreath.

The &quot;star&quot; (or ) is worn by the Grand Cross (in gilt on the left chest) and the Grand Officer (in silver on the right chest) respectively; it is similar to the badge, but without enamel, and with the wreath replaced by a cluster of rays in between each arm. The central disc features the head of Marianne, surrounded by the legend (&#x27;French Republic&#x27;) and the motto .

The &quot;ribbon&quot; for the medal is plain red.

The badge or star is not usually worn, except at the time of the decoration ceremony or on a dress uniform or formal wear. Instead, one normally wears the ribbon or rosette on their suit.

For less formal occasions, recipients wear a simple stripe of thread sewn onto the lapel (red for and , silver for ). Except when wearing a dark suit with a lapel, women instead typically wear a small lapel pin called a barrette. Recipients purchase the special thread and barrettes at a store in Paris near the Palais-Royal.

<doc id="160190" wikidata="Q468608" url="?curid=160190" title="Gelon">
<text>Gelon also known as Gelo (Greek: Γέλων &quot;Gelon&quot;, &quot;gen.&quot;: Γέλωνος; died 478 BC), son of Deinomenes, was a Greek tyrant of the Sicilian cities Gela and Syracuse, Sicily, and first of the Deinomenid rulers.

== Early life ==
Gelon was the son of Deinomenes. According to Herodotus, Gelon&#x27;s ancestors came from the island of Telos in the Aegean Sea and were the founders of the city of Gela in southern Sicily. One of his later ancestors, Telines, was said to have reconciled his people after a period of civil strife through the divine rites of the Earth Goddesses; Herodotus infers that all of Telines&#x27; descendants, including Gelon, were priests of this cult.

Gelon&#x27;s three brothers were Hieron, Thrasybulus and Polyzalos. Deinomenes consulted an oracle about the fates of his children, and was told that Gelon, Hieron and Thrasybulus were all destined to become tyrants.

Gelon fought in a number of the conflicts between the various tyrant kings of Sicily and earned a reputation as a formidable soldier. His performance was so impressive that he was promoted to be commander of the cavalry for his uncle Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela. From this position he played a key role in a number of battles, including one against Syracuse, a city which he himself would later conquer.

== Rise to power ==
But it was not until Hippocrates was killed in a battle with the native Sicel tribe of Sicily at Hybla that Gelon&#x27;s rise to power began. Upon Hippocrates&#x27; death his sons retained the throne, but the common people were tired of this family&#x27;s rule and revolted. Gelon quelled the revolt on the pretext of helping Hippocrates&#x27; sons gain power. Instead, he took power for himself with the help of the army in 491 BC. The territory now under his control as tyrant included that of Gela, Naxos in the east, Zancle in the northeast, and Camarina in the south.

== Tyrant of Syracuse ==
Gelon ruled over Gela and his other territories in eastern Sicily peacefully for the next five years. In 485 BC, the aristocracy of Syracuse called the Gamori, who had been forced out of the city by the common people, came to Gelon seeking his aid. Seeing an opportunity for expansion, Gelon used his now large military force to capture the city of Syracuse with little or no resistance, reinstating the exiled Gamori.

Gelon now ruled as the new tyrant of Syracuse and left his brother Hiero to rule over Gela. According to Herodotus, he forced half the citizens of Gela to move to Syracuse. Similarly, he removed all the aristocracy from Camarina.

He continued this strategy as he conquered nearby Euboea and Megara Hyblaea (483 BC), forcibly removing the aristocracy from each city and placing the rest of the population in slavery. According to Herodotus, because he was raised as a noble and was constantly in the presence of nobility, Gelon did not care for the lower class, and &quot;found the common people unpleasant to share a house with&quot;.

Under Gelon&#x27;s rule, Syracuse soon became prosperous. Along with grand building program in Syracuse, Gelon sought also to create a powerful mercenary army. Most of the recruits for his army came from the native Sicel tribes. However, some were recruited from the Greek mainland, men who had most likely fought with Gelon at some point in the past, and their total number was said to be around 10,000. All of these men were granted citizenship of Syracuse.

Gelon found a powerful ally in Theron, tyrant of Acragas, a city west of Gela, after he married Theron&#x27;s daughter, Demareta. In 481 BC representatives of Athens came to him asking for his aid in the upcoming war against Xerxes I and his Persian army. Gelon replied that he could supply 28,000 men as well as 200 ships if he was appointed commander of either the Greek navy or army. He was denied both positions and, therefore, refused to supply the Greeks with any supplies or men. In fact, he went so far as to prepare gifts for Xerxes in case the Persian king won his war against the Greek alliance.

Among Gelon&#x27;s forces offered to the Athenians there was a large proportion of cavalry and light troops, including archers and slingers, which suggests military science had achieved a higher level under Gelon than in Athens and Sparta.

== Battle of Himera ==
His unwillingness to support the Greeks could have been related to the threat posed by the Carthaginians on the west coast of Sicily. Theron of Acragas had jeopardized the independence of all of Sicily from the powerful Carthaginians when he defeated the tyrant Terillus at Himera. Seeking a powerful ally to assist in recapturing Himera, Terillus went to Carthage for assistance. The Carthaginians were happy to respond to his plea. The Carthaginians were keen to increase their influence and territory in Sicily and the opportunity came at a perfect time because of the coming Persian invasion of Greece.

Some scholars argue that Xerxes and the Carthaginians were in contact with each other and coordinated a simultaneous attack on both the western and eastern fronts of Greece and its colonies, in the hopes that it would prevent either front from aiding the other. In any case, in 480 BC a Carthaginian force of 300,000 men landed at Panormus on the north coast of Sicily and advanced east towards Himera, led by their general Hamilcar. Gelon, upon hearing the danger his ally Theron was in, led an army of 50,000 men and 5,000 cavalry to Himera.

A contingent of Gelon&#x27;s men gained access to the Carthaginian camp by posing as allies from the nearby city of Selinus. Once inside they signalled to the rest of Gelon&#x27;s troops, who were stationed in the mountains overlooking the camp, by setting fire to Hamilcar&#x27;s ships. The ensuing battle was a decisive victory for Gelon and Theron, with Carthaginian casualties estimated at 150,000, including Hamilcar.

The riches collected from the Carthaginian camp, as well as the 2,000 talents of silver that resulted from the peace treaty with Carthage, were dispersed by Gelon among his troops and his allies, with a large amount designated for the construction of a new temple in Syracuse. According to Herodotus, upon his return to his capital, Gelon organized a meeting with the people of Syracuse, and described to them his actions during the war with Hamilcar, and the manner in which he dispersed the spoils. He told them that if they found anything wrong in his conduct, they were free to kill him and take control of Syracuse for themselves. The people of Syracuse decided to keep Gelon as their tyrant, and he continued his reign in peace for the next two years.

== Death and succession==
Gelon died in 478 BC after ruling Syracuse for seven years. Control of his kingdom passed to his brother Hieron, who ruled for the next 10 years until his death, when a dispute over to whom the crown should pass led to the dissolution of the Syracusan state.

== Analysis of contribution to Sicily and Greek history ==
Gelon&#x27;s first major contribution to Greek, and more specifically Sicilian, history was the foundation of Syracuse as his capital, which he turned into &quot;the greatest Greek city in the west.&quot; The location of the city itself made it a prime spot for such a role. The city was located on an island, connected to the mainland by a peninsula constructed in the 6th century BC. The city faced east towards the Greek mainland and had its own harbour.

Gelon constructed a wall that ran from the fort of Achradina on the mainland to the sea, making Syracuse virtually impregnable. Also, by bringing in the wealthy citizens from conquered cities, a tactic never before used in Sicily, he greatly increased the prosperity of the city. He constructed a theatre which improved the city&#x27;s culture, and following the victory at Himera, he built an ornate temple dedicated to the goddess Athena. All of these improvements influenced the history of Syracuse for many years. The city was an important outpost for both the Roman and Byzantine empires, and today is a location of great historical importance for Sicily and Italy.

The other great contribution of Gelon was the victory at Himera over the Carthaginians. The battle was significant because of the timing and location of the event. There is little doubt that if Hamilcar had managed to defeat the large Sicilian force of Gelon and Theron, he could have conquered the entire island of Sicily if he so wished. The Greek states on the mainland would have been unable to send troops due to their own war with the Persians. If, as many historians believe, the Persian and Carthaginian armies were in contact with each other, a defeat at Himera for Gelon could have led to a two pronged attack on the Greek mainland by the Persian and the Carthaginians, and perhaps to the eventual demise of Greek civilisation. But by defeating Hamilcar in 480 BC, Gelon managed to keep Sicily free from Carthaginian invasion for the next seventy years.

Gelon seems to have been highly regarded by his subjects at least partially due to his victory at the Battle of Himera. This respect is apparent from the elaborate tomb and statue built in his memory at public expense.

Despite Gelon&#x27;s mistreatment of conquered people, his reputation as a respected tyrant and generous king survived the passage of time. Perhaps the greatest testament to his influence over Sicily is how his statue was spared as Timoleon tried to erase all memory of the reign of tyrants when Sicily became a democracy 150 years after Gelon&#x27;s death.

<text>Timoleon (Greek: ), son of Timodemus, of Corinth (–337 BC) was a Greek statesman and general.

As a brilliant general, a champion of Greece against Carthage, and a fighter against despotism, he is closely connected with the history of Sicily, especially Syracuse.

==Early life==
Timoleon was a member of the Corinthian oligarchy. In the mid 360s BC, Timophanes, the brother of Timoleon, took possession of the acropolis of Corinth and effectively made himself tyrant of the city. In response, Timoleon, who had earlier heroically saved his brother&#x27;s life in battle, and after repeatedly pleading with him to desist, became involved in the assassination of Timophanes. Most Corinthians approved his conduct as patriotic; however, the tragic occurrence, the actual fratricide, the curses of his mother, and the indignation of some of his fellow citizens, drove him into a self-imposed early withdrawal from politics and civic life for twenty years.

==Sicily==
Because of inner strife, the depredations and decline in Syracuse caused by the despots Dionysius I and his son who succeeded him, and because of the repeated conflicts with powerful Carthage, a group of Syracusans sent an appeal for help to Corinth, their mother city, which reached that city-state in 344 BC. 
Corinth agreed to help, but her chief citizens declined to accept the seemingly hopeless task of establishing a stable government in tyrannical, fractious, insecure, and turbulent Syracuse.

Timoleon, being named by an unknown voice in the Corinthian popular assembly, was chosen by a unanimous vote to undertake the mission. He set sail for Sicily with seven ships, a few of the leading citizens of Corinth, and a small force of 700 Greek mercenaries. He eluded a Carthaginian squadron by an ingenious stratagem and landed at Tauromenium (now Taormina) in 344 BC, where he met with a friendly reception. At this time Hicetas, tyrant of Leontini, was master of Syracuse, with the exception of the island of Ortygia, which was occupied by Dionysius II, still nominally ruler.

Hicetas was defeated by Timoleon at Adranum, an inland town, and driven back to Syracuse. After his initial unexpected success, Timoleon was sent reinforcements from Corinth and some north-western Greek states. Following the siege of Syracuse, Dionysius II surrendered Ortygia in 343 BC on the condition of his being granted a safe conduct to Corinth, where he ended his life as a private, well-off, citizen.

Hicetas now received help from Carthage (60,000 men), but ill-success roused mutual suspicion; the Carthaginians abandoned Hicetas, who was besieged in Leontini, and who was then compelled to surrender. Timoleon was thus master of Syracuse.

He at once began the work of restoration, beginning with the symbolic act of destroying the citadel constructed and used by the tyrants to oppress the people of Syracuse, and replacing it with a courthouse. He brought new settlers to depopulated Sicily from all over Greece, and re-established a popular government on the basis of the democratic laws of Diocles. The &quot;amphipolos&quot;, or priest of Olympian Zeus (), who was chosen annually by lot out of three clans, was invested with the chief magistracy. The impress of Timoleon&#x27;s reforms seems to have lasted to the days of Augustus.

Hicetas persuaded Carthage to send (340–339 BC) a great army of 70,000 men, which landed at Lilybaeum (now Marsala). With a miscellaneous levy of about 12,000 men, most of them mercenaries, Timoleon marched westwards across the island to the neighbourhood of Selinus. Against all odds, after being deserted by a part of his army who believed that facing a foe six times as large as their own was hopeless, Timoleon, at the head of his infantry, won a great and decisive victory on the Crimissus. His victory was made possible by the fact that the Carthaginian army had not yet completed the river crossing, so his small force only had to fight the elite part of the Carthaginian force. He was also aided by a violent storm at the backs of his troops but blinding to the Carthaginians.

Later, Carthage dispatched mercenaries to prolong the conflict between Timoleon and the Greek tyrants. But this ended in the defeat of Hicetas, who was taken prisoner and put to death. A treaty in 338 BC was agreed upon, by which Carthage was confined in Sicily to the west of the Halycus (Platani) river and undertook to give no further help to Sicilian tyrants. Most of the remaining tyrants were killed or expelled. This treaty gave the Greeks of Sicily many years of peace, restored prosperity, rule of law, and safety from Carthage.

== Ruler of Syracuse ==
Timoleon established a new Syracusan constitution, described at the time as democratic. For a short time he had wide powers equivalent to a supreme commander. He invited settlers from mainland Greece to assist in the re-population of Syracuse and other Sicilian cities. During this period, Greek Sicily enjoyed a recovery in its economy and culture.

==Retirement==
Timoleon retired into private life shortly after the goals he set out to accomplish were met. He remained almost universally admired for his brilliant victories, moderation, and the restoration of democracy after half a century of tyranny, suffering, near economic collapse, turmoil, and depopulation. After his retirement, when important issues were under discussion the by-now blind Timoleon was carried to the assembly to give his opinion, which was usually accepted. He was buried at the cost of the citizens of Syracuse, who erected a monument to his memory in their market-place, afterwards surrounded with porticoes, and a gymnasium called Timoleonteum.

== Historical analysis==
The ancient historian Timaeus praised Timoleon. Polybius, an ancient historian with oligarchic sympathies, said Timaeus was biased in favour of Timoleon and many modern historians have agreed with Polybius. Peter Green said that Timoleon tended to pose as a democrat while using the methods of a tyrant (albeit benevolently), and that Timoleon tried to maintain the outward forms of democracy, reformed Syracuse in a democratic direction, and demolished the stronghold of the island that had been useful to tyrants in the past.

When taken to court on spurious grounds, Timoleon refused to be exempted, saying that this was the &quot;precise purpose for which he had so long laboured and combated—in order that every Syracusan citizen might be enabled to appeal to the laws and exercise freely his legal rights.&quot;

The historian George Grote agreed with a eulogy given by a Syracusan at Timoleon&#x27;s funeral, about three years after the Crimissus victory:The Syracusan people solemnise, at the cost of 200 minae, the funeral of this man . . .They have passed a vote to honour him for all future time. . .,—because, after having put down the despots, subdued the foreign enemy, and re-colonised the greatest among the ruined cities, he restored to the Sicilian Greeks their constitution and laws.

<text>Dionysius I or Dionysius the Elder ( 432 – 367 BC) was a Greek tyrant of Syracuse, Sicily. He conquered several cities in Sicily and southern Italy, opposed Carthage&#x27;s influence in Sicily and made Syracuse the most powerful of the Western Greek colonies. He was regarded by the ancients as the worst kind of despot: cruel, suspicious, and vindictive.

==Early life==
Dionysius began his working life as a clerk in a public office. Because of his achievements in the war against Carthage that began in 409 BC, he was elected supreme military commander in 406 BC. In the following year he seized total power and became tyrant. He was married to Aristomache, and had a daughter by her, Arete. He was married at the same time to Doris of Locris, who bore him his son, Dionysius II of Syracuse.

==Rise to power==
Dionysius seized power with the help of a personal group of mercenaries, likely recruited from among the Sileraioi. This force, initially 600 men and later raised to 1,000, was granted to him as a bodyguard after he faked an attack on his own life. Having consolidated his position, Dionysius imposed the mercenaries on all parts of the polis community, signaling that democracy had ended in Syracuse. His rule was &quot;unconstitutional and illegitimate and could not fail to provoke rebellions among the partisans of democratic government&quot;. Dionysius&#x27; position at home was threatened as early as 403 by those philosophically opposed to tyranny. Sparta, which had in the past deposed tyrants from Corinth to Athens, did not damn Dionysius and his autocracy. In fact, according to the historian Diodorus Siculus, relations between the two were very positive:
When the Lacedaemonians [Spartans] had settled the affairs of Greece to their own taste, they dispatched Aristus, one of their distinguished men, to Syracuse, ostensibly pretending that they would overthrow the government, but in truth with intent to increase the power of the tyranny; for they hoped that by helping to establish the rule of Dionysius they would obtain his ready service because of their benefactions to him.

Dionysius even received the privilege of conscripting mercenaries from lands under Spartan authority. The demise of such a prominent democratic &quot;polis&quot; and the subsequent actions of Dionysius represented a recurring norm in fourth-century Greek states, thanks to the prevalence of mercenaries. The mercenary and the tyrant went hand in hand; for example, Polybius noted that &quot;the security of despots rests entirely on the loyalty and power of mercenaries&quot;. Aristotle wrote that some form of &quot;guard&quot; (i.e., a personal army) is needed for absolute kingship, and for an elected tyrant an optimum number of professional soldiers should be employed. Too few would undermine the tyrant&#x27;s power, while too many would threaten the polis itself. The philosopher also notes that the people of Syracuse were warned not to let Dionysius conscript too many &quot;guards&quot; during his regime.

==Conquests==

He fought a war with Carthage from 397 BC to 392 BC with mixed success; his attempts to drive the Carthaginians entirely out of Sicily failed; at his death they were still masters of at least a third of it. 

He carried out an expedition against the Italiote League in 387 BC in southern Italy. In one campaign, in which he was joined by the Lucanians, he devastated the territories of Thurii and Croton in an attempt to defend Locri. After a protracted siege, he took Rhegium in 386 and sold the inhabitants as slaves. 

He also pillaged the temple of Caere (then allied with Rome) on the Etruscan coast. In the Adriatic, to facilitate trade, Dionysius founded Ancona, Adria and Issa. After him, the Adriatic became a sea of Syracuse. In the Corinthian War, he joined the side of the Spartans and assisted them with mercenaries and ships (which contributed in blocking the Athenians&#x27; supplies from the Black Sea forcing them to peace).

In 385 BC, Alcetas of Epirus was a refugee in Dionysius&#x27; court. Dionysius wanted a friendly monarch in Epirus, so he sent 2,000 Greek hoplites and 500 suits of Greek armour to help the Illyrians under Bardyllis in attacking the Molossians of Epirus. They ravaged the region and killed 15,000 Molossians, and Alcetas regained his throne. He joined the Illyrians in an attempt to plunder the temple of Delphi. Sparta intervened under Agesilaus, however, and with aid from Thessaly, Macedonia, and the Molossians themselves, the Spartans expelled the Illyrians.

==Death==

According to some sources, after gaining a prize for one of his tragedies, “The Ransom of Hector” (see &quot;Intellectual tastes&quot; below), at a competition at the Lenaia festival at Athens, he was so elated that he drank himself to death. Others such as Cicero and Diodorus Siculus report that he died of natural causes shortly after learning of his play&#x27;s victory in 367 BC. According to others, he was given an overdose of a sleeping potion by his physicians at the instigation of his son, Dionysius the Younger, who succeeded him as ruler of Syracuse. A similar theory, proposed by Justin, stated that Dionysius &quot;was defeated and broken by constant warfare, and finally murdered by a conspiracy of his own kin&quot;. Modern historian Jeff Champion states that there is no evidence to prove the claim he was conspired against.

His life was written by Philistus, but the work is lost.

==Intellectual tastes==
Like Pisistratus, tyrant of Athens, Dionysius was fond of having literary men around him, such as the historian Philistus, the poet Philoxenus, and the philosopher Plato, but treated them in a most arbitrary manner. Diodorus Siculus relates in his &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; that Dionysius once had Philoxenus arrested and sent to the quarries for voicing a bad opinion about his poetry. The next day, he released Philoxenus because of his friends&#x27; requests, and brought the poet before him for another poetry reading. Dionysius read his own work and the audience applauded. When he asked Philoxenus how he liked it, the poet turned to the guards and said &quot;take me back to the quarries.&quot; Plutarch relates a version of this story in his &quot;On the Fortune of Alexander&quot;.

He also posed as an author and patron of literature; his poems, severely criticized by Philoxenus, were hissed at the Olympic games, but having gained a prize for a tragedy on the &quot;Ransom of Hector&quot; at the Lenaea at Athens, he was so elated that he engaged in a debauch which, according to some sources, proved fatal. His name is also known for the legend of Damon and Pythias, and he features indirectly (via his son) in the legend of the Sword of Damocles. The Ear of Dionysius in Syracuse is an artificial limestone cave named after Dionysius.

== Historical significance and legacy ==

Dionysius was one of the major figures in Greek and European history. He was a champion of the struggle between the Greeks and Carthage for Sicily, and was the first to bring the war into the enemy&#x27;s territory. He transformed Syracuse into the most powerful city in the Greek world, and made it the seat of an empire stretching from Sicily across to Italy. It is said that Dionysius foreshadowed the accomplishments of Alexander the Great and beyond him of Augustus. He also foreshadowed these later rulers in being one of the first Greek rulers to be given divine honors during his lifetime, and he made innovations in military technique, such as siege engines, which became a standard feature of warfare under Alexander the Great and later generals.

It has been theorized that Brennus was working in concert with Dionysius, who sought to control all of Sicily. Rome had strong allegiances with Messana, a small city state in north east Sicily, which Dionysius wanted to control. Rome&#x27;s army being pinned down by Brennus&#x27; efforts would have assisted Dionysius&#x27;s campaign.

==Walls of Syracuse==
In 402 BC Dionysius I began building the walls of Syracuse, which included an impressive citadel, the Euryalus fortress, protecting the plateau to the northwest of Syracuse, the remains of which are still visible today. The walls were completed in 397 BC and had the following characteristics:

* Length: 27 km
* Width at base: 3.3 m to 5.35 m
* Number of known towers on circuit: 14 (including Euryalos)
* Largest tower: 8.5 m x 8.5 m
* Deepest ditch (at Euryalos fortress): 9 m
Building so big a fortress would have involved installing well over 300 tons of stone every day for 5 years.

==In popular culture and literature==
Dionysius I is one of the central characters in the legend of the Sword of Damocles.

Dionysius I also appears to be mentioned in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;) (1308–21) as a tyrant who suffers in a river of boiling blood, although there is some dispute the Dionysius of reference may be his son, Dionysius II.

He features prominently in L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Arrows of Hercules&quot; (1965) as a patron of inventors on the island of Ortygia near Syracuse. 

A fictional version of Dionysius is a character in Mary Renault&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Mask of Apollo&quot; (1966). 

He is the main character in Valerio Massimo Manfredi&#x27;s novel &quot;Tyrant&quot; (2003). 

&quot;Dionysius the Tyrant&quot; is mentioned in the 2006 Robert Harris novel &quot;Imperium&quot; as the founder of the Stone Quarries of Syracuse. The narrator, Marcus Tullius Tiro, proclaims the Stone Quarries &quot;the most fearsome prison in the world.&quot;

He is featured in the 1962 film &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot; (&quot;Il tiranno di Siracusa&quot;). 

He also features in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Die Bürgschaft&quot;, as well as Osamu Dazai&#x27;s reworked version &quot;Run, Melos!&quot;.

<doc id="160195" wikidata="Q1078602" url="?curid=160195" title="Kingdom of Nepal">
<text>The Kingdom of Nepal () was a Hindu kingdom in South Asia, formed in 1768 by the expansion of the Gorkha Kingdom, which lasted until 2008 when the kingdom became the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. It was also known as the Gorkha Empire (), or sometimes Asal Hindustan (). Founded by King Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Gorkha monarch who claimed to be of Thakuri origin from chaubisi, it existed for 240 years until the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008. During this period, Nepal was formally under the rule of the Shah dynasty, which exercised varying degrees of power during the kingdom&#x27;s existence.
After the invasion of Tibet and plundering of Digarcha by Nepali forces under Prince Regent Bahadur Shah in 1792, the Dalai Lama and Chinese Ambans reported to the Chinese administration for military support. The Chinese and Tibetan forces under Fuk&#x27;anggan attacked Nepal but went for negotiations after failure at Nuwakot. &quot;Mulkaji&quot; Damodar Pande, who was the most influential among the four Kajis, was appointed after the removal of Bahadur Shah.
Chief &quot;Kaji&quot; (&quot;Mulkaji&quot;) Kirtiman Singh Basnyat, tried to protect king Girvan Yuddha Shah and keep former king, Rana Bahadur Shah away from Nepal. However, on 4 March 1804, the former king came back and took over as &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; and Damodar Pande was then beheaded in Thankot. The 1806 Bhandarkhal massacre instigated upon the death of Rana Bahadur Shah, set forth the rise of the authoritative &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; Bhimsen Thapa, who became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Nepal from 1806 to 1837. During the early nineteenth century, however, the expansion of the East India Company&#x27;s rule in India led to the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–1816), which resulted in Nepal&#x27;s defeat. 
Under the Treaty of Sugauli, the kingdom retained its internal independence, but in exchange for territorial concessions, marking the Mechi and Sharda rivers as the boundary of Nepalese territories. The territory of the kingdom before the Sugauli treaty is sometimes nascently referred to as &quot;Greater Nepal&quot;. In the political scenario, the death of &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; Mathbar Singh Thapa ended the Thapa hegemony and set the stage for the Kot massacre. This resulted in the ascendancy of the Rana dynasty of Khas (Chhetri) and made the office of the Prime Minister of Nepal hereditary in their family for the next century, from 1843 to 1951. Beginning with Jung Bahadur, the first Rana ruler, the Rana dynasty reduced the Shah monarch to a figurehead role. The Rana rule was marked by tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution.
In July 1950, the newly independent Republic of India signed a friendship treaty in which both nations agreed to respect the other&#x27;s sovereignty as well as continue to have an open border. In November of the same year, India played an important role in supporting King Tribhuvan, whom the Rana leader Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana had attempted to depose and replace with his infant grandson who would later become King Gyanendra. With Indian support for a new government consisting largely of the Nepali Congress, King Tribhuvan ended the Rana regime in 1951.
Unsuccessful attempts were made to implement reforms and adopt a constitution during the 1960s and 1970s. An economic crisis at the end of the 1980s led to a popular movement that brought about parliamentary elections and the adoption of a constitutional monarchy in 1990. The 1990s saw the beginning of the Nepalese Civil War (1996–2006), a conflict between government forces and the insurgent forces of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). The situation of the Nepalese monarchy was further destabilised by the 2001 Nepalese royal massacre.
As a result of the massacre, King Gyanendra returned to the throne. His imposition of direct rule in 2005 provoked a protest movement unifying the Maoist insurgency and pro-democracy activists. He was eventually forced to restore the House of Representatives, which in 2007 adopted an interim constitution greatly restricting the powers of the Nepalese monarchy. Following an election held the next year, the Nepalese Constituent Assembly formally abolished the kingdom in its first session on 28 May 2008, declaring the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal in its place.
Until the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal was the world&#x27;s only country to have Hinduism as its state religion; since becoming a republic, the country is now formally a secular state.

==History==

===18th century===
====Origins====

The country was expanded from the one of the Chaubise principality called the Gorkha Kingdom. In Nepal, the warrior people are not referred to as &#x27;Gurkhas&#x27;, they are called &#x27;Gorkhalis&#x27;, meaning the &#x27;inhabitants of Gorkha.&#x27; Their famed battle cry is &quot;Jai Kali, Jai Gorakhnath, Jai Manakamana&quot;.
The etymology of the geographical name &#x27;Gorkha&#x27; is indeed related to the Hindu mendicant-saint Gorakhnath. In the village of Gorkha, there is a temple dedicated to Gorakhnath as well as another dedicated to Gorakhkali, a corresponding female deity. The Nepali geographical encyclopedia &quot;&#x27;Mechi dekhi Mahakali&quot;&#x27; (From Mechi to Mahakali) published in B.S. 2013 (1974–75 AD) by the authoritarian Panchayat government to mark the coronation of King Birendra Shah agrees with the association of the name of the place with the saint but does not add any further detail. The facts regarding when the temples were built and the place named after the saint are lost in the sweeping winds of time. We may guess that these developments took place in the early part of the second millennium of the Common Era following the rise of the Nath sect. In fact, the pilgrimage circuit of the sect across the northern Indian sub-continent also spans a major part of Nepal including the Kathmandu Valley. The Newars of Medieval Nepal have a couple of important temples and festivals dedicated to the major Nath teachers. Immediately before the rule of Gorkha by the Shahs, Gorkha was inhabited by both aboriginee Aryan and Tibetan Mongoloid ethnic groups Magars the largest among the ethnic groups and ruled by the Magars, Khadka Magar sub-clan of Rana-Magar and Ghale Magar sub-clan of Thapa-Magar clan, who were probably of Magar origin. At first, Dravya Shah captured Liglig-kot kingdom from Magars King Dalsur Ghale Magar. Gangaram Rana Magar also helped Drabya Shah. After captured Ligligkot, (now Gorkha) Dravya Shah defeated the King Mansingh Khadka Magar in 1559 AD and commenced Shah rule over the principality. Prithvi Narayan Shah belonged to the ninth generation of the Shahs in Gorkha. He took the reins of power in 1742 AD.

====Expansion====

King Prithvi Narayan Shah, the ruler of the small principality of Gorkha, initially drafted the Gorkhali Army. The Chief of the Gorkhali Army were drawn from Chhetri noble families of Gorkha such as Pande family, Basnyat family and Thapa dynasty before the rule of the Rana dynasty. However, the first civilian army chief was &quot;Kaji&quot; Kalu Pande who had significant role in the campaign of Nepal. He was considered as an army head due to the undertaking of duties and responsibilities of the army but not by the formalization of the title.

====Battle of Nuwakot====

The first battle by Gorkhali forces united under King Prithvi Narayan Shah was the Battle of Nuwakot. The first army commander was &quot;Kaji&quot; Kalu Pande of the Pande noble family of Gorkha and Jayant Rana Magar (former Kaji of Gorkha) was appointed General by King of Kantiur Jaya Prakash Malla to defend Nuwakot against Gorkha. Pande put up tactics to attack Nuwakot, a strategic fort of Malla king of Kathmandu, from multiple sides by surprise. On 26 September 1744, Pande with a contingent of soldiers climbed from the northern side of Nuwakot city at Mahamandal. He led the surprise attack with a Gorkhali war cry of &quot;Jai Kali, Jai Gorakhnath, Jai Manakamana&quot;. The panicked soldiers of Nuwakot under commander Shankha Mani Rana Magar (son of Jayant Rana Magar) tried to defend but lost after their commander was killed by the 13-year-old Prince Dal Mardan Shah, brother of the king. The second contingent of Gorkhali forces led by &quot;Chautariya&quot; Mahoddam Kirti Shah (also a brother of the king) passed Dharampani and faced strong tussle but ultimately won over the defenders. The third part of the forces, led by the king himself, advanced to the fort of Nuwakotgadhi after the capture of Mahamandal. The soldiers panicked by death of their commander fled to Belkot (Jayant Rana Magar second fort) from the Nuwakot fort and Nuwakot was annexed by Gorkha.

====Battle of Kirtipur====

Despite his initial resentment that the valley kings were well prepared and the Gorkhalis were not, &quot;Kaji&quot; Kalu Pande agreed for a battle against the kingdom of Kirtipur in the Kathmandu valley on being insisted by the king. The Gorkhalis had set up a base in Naikap to mount their assaults on Kirtipur. They were armed with swords, bows and arrows and muskets. The two forces fought on the plain of &quot;Tyangla Phant&quot; in the northwest of Kirtipur. Surapratap Shah, the king&#x27;s brother, lost his right eye to an arrow while scaling the city wall. The Gorkhali commander &quot;Kaji&quot; Kalu Pande was surrounded and killed, and the Gorkhali king himself narrowly escaped with his life into the surrounding hills disguised as a saint. In 1767, King Prithvi Narayan Shah sent his army to attack Kirtipur for a third time under the command of Surapratap. In response, the three kings of the valley joined forces and sent their troops to the relief of Kirtipur, but they could not dislodge the Gorkhalis from their positions. A noble of Lalitpur named Danuvanta crossed over to Shah&#x27;s side and treacherously let the Gorkhalis into the town.

====Annexation of Makwanpur &amp; Hariharpur====
King Digbardhan Sen and his minister Kanak Singh Baniya had already sent their families to safer grounds before the encirclement of their fortress. The Gorkhalis launched an attack on 21 August 1762. The battle lasted for eight hours. King Digbardhan and Kanak Singh escaped to Hariharpurgadhi. Makawanpur was thus annexed by the Gorkhali forces.
After occupying the Makawanpurgadhi fort, the Gorkhali forces started planning for an attack on Hariharpurgadhi, a strategic fort on a mountain ridge of the Mahabharat range south of Kathmandu. It controlled the route to the Kathmandu valley. At the dusk of 4 October 1762, the Gorkhalis launched an attack. The soldiers at Hariharpurgadhi fought valiantly against the Gorkhali forces but were ultimately forced to vacate the &quot;Gadhi&quot; (fort) after midnight. About 500 soldiers of Hariharpur died in the battle. Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal extended his help to kings of Kathmandu valley with his forces to attack the Gorkhali forces. On 20 January 1763, Gorkhali commander Vamsharaj Pande won the battle against Mir Qasim. Similarly, Captain Kinloch of British East India Company also extended his support by sending contingents against Gorkhalis. King Prithvi Narayan sent &quot;Kaji&quot; Vamsharaj Pande, Naahar Singh Basnyat, Jeeva Shah, Ram Krishna Kunwar and others to defeat the forces of Gurgin Khan at Makwanpur.

====Conquest of Kathmandu valley and Declaration of Kingdom of Nepal====
The victory in the Battle of Kirtipur climaxed Shah&#x27;s two-decade-long effort to take possession of the wealthy Kathmandu valley. After the fall of Kirtipur, Shah took over the cities of Kathmandu and Lalitpur in 1768 and Bhaktapur in 1769, completing his conquest of the valley. In a letter to Ram Krishna Kunwar, King Prithvi Narayan Shah expressed his unhappiness at the death of &quot;Kaji&quot; Kalu Pande in Kirtipur and thought it was impossible to conquer Kathmandu valley after the death of Kalu Pande. After the annexation of Kathmandu valley, King Prithvi Narayan Shah praised in his letter about the valour and wisdom shown by Kunwar in the annexation of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur (collectively known as Nepal valley at the time). Vamsharaj Pande, Kalu Pande&#x27;s eldest son, was the commander of the Gorkhali forces who led the attack during the Battle of Bhaktapur on 14 April 1769.

====Conquest of the Kirata====

King Prithvi Narayan Shah had deployed &quot;Sardar&quot; Ram Krishna Kunwar to the invasion of Kirata regional areas comprising; Pallo Kirant (Limbuwan), Wallo Kirant and Majh Kirant (Khambuwan). On B.S. 1829 Bhadra 13 (i.e. 29 August 1772), Kunwar crossed the Dudhkoshi river to invade King Karna Sen of the Majh Kirant (Khambuwan) and Saptari region with fellow commander Abhiman Singh Basnyat. He then crossed the Arun river to reach Chainpur (Limbuwan), where he later achieved victory over the Kiratas. King Prithvi Narayan Shah bestowed 22 pairs of &quot;Shirpau&quot; (special headgear) in appreciation to Ram Krishna Kunwar after his victory over the Kirata region.

==== Political conflicts ====
In 1775, the King Prithvi Narayan Shah, who expanded the Gorkha Kingdom into the Kingdom of Nepal, died in Nuwakot. Swarup Singh Karki, a shrewd Gorkhali courtier from a Chhetri family of eastern Nepal, marched with an army to Nuwakot to confine Prince Bahadur Shah who was then mourning the death of his father. He confined Bahadur Shah and Dal Mardan Shah with the consent from newly reigning King Pratap Singh Shah who was considered to have no distinction of right and wrong. In the annual &quot;Pajani&quot; (renewal) of that year, Swarup Singh was promoted to the position of &quot;Kaji&quot; along with Abhiman Singh Basnyat, Amar Singh Thapa and Parashuram Thapa. In Falgun 1832 B.S., he succeeded in exiling Bahadur Shah, Dal Mardan Shah and &quot;Guru&quot; Gajraj Mishra on three heinous charges. The reign of Pratap Singh Shah was characterized by the constant rivalry between Swarup Singh and Vamsharaj Pande. The document dated B.S. 1833 Bhadra 3 &quot;Roj&quot; 6 (i.e. Friday, 2 August 1776), shows that he had carried the title of Dewan along with Vamsharaj Pande. King Pratap Singh Shah died on 22 November 1777 with his infant son Rana Bahadur Shah succeeding as the King of Nepal. Sarbajit Rana Magar was made a &quot;Kaji&quot; along with Balbhadra Shah and Vamsharaj Pande while Daljit Shah was chosen as Chief &quot;Chautariya&quot;. Historian Dilli Raman Regmi asserts that Sarbajit Rana Magar was chosen as &quot;Mulkaji&quot; (equivalent to Prime Minister), while historian Rishikesh Shah asserts that Sarbajit Rana was the head of the Nepalese government only for a short period in 1778. Afterwards, rivalry arose between Prince Bahadur Shah and Queen Rajendra Laxmi. Sarbajit Rana led the followers of the Queen opposed to Sriharsh Pant who led the followers of Bahadur Shah. The group of &quot;Bharadars&quot; (officers) led by Sarbajit badmouthed Rajendra Laxmi against Bahadur Shah. Queen Rajendra Laxmi succeeded in the confinement of Bahadur Shah with the help of her new minister Sarbajit Rana Magar. &quot;Guru&quot; Gajraj Mishra came to the rescue of Bahadur Shah on a condition that Bahadur Shah should leave the country. Also, his rival Sriharsh Pant was branded outcast and expelled instead of being executed as execution was prohibited for Brahmins.
Prince Bahadur Shah confined his sister-in-law Queen Rajendra Laxmi on the charge of having illicit relation with Sarbajit Rana Magar on 31 August 1778. Subsequently, Sarbajit was executed inside the palace by Bahadur Shah with the help of male servants of the royal palace. Historian Bhadra Ratna Bajracharya asserts that it was actually &quot;Chautariya&quot; Daljit Shah who led the opposing group against Sarbajit Rana Magar and Queen Rajendra Rajya Laxmi Devi. The letter dated B.S. 1835 Bhadra 11 &quot;Roj&quot; 4 (1778) to Narayan Malla and Vrajabasi Pande asserts the death of Sarbajit under misconduct and the appointment of Bahadur Shah as regent. The death of Sarbajit Rana Magar is considered to have marked the initiation of court conspiracies and massacres in the newly unified Kingdom of Nepal. Historian Baburam Acharya points that the sanctions against Queen Rajendra Laxmi under moral misconduct was a mistake of Bahadur Shah. Similarly, the murder of Sarbajit Rana Magar was condemned by many historians as an act of injustice.
Vamsharaj Pande, once Dewan of Nepal and son of the popular commander Kalu Pande, was beheaded on the allegations of conspiring with Queen Rajendra Laxmi. In a special tribunal meeting at Bhandarkhal garden east of Kathmandu Durbar, Swaroop Singh held Vamsharaj liable for letting the King of Parbat, Kirtibam Malla, run away in the battle a year ago. He had a fiery conversation with Vamsharaj before Vamsharaj was declared guilty and was subsequently executed by beheading on the tribunal. Historian Rishikesh Shah and Ganga Karmacharya claim that he was executed in March 1785, whereas Bhadra Ratna Bajracharya and Tulsi Ram Vaidya claim that he was executed on 21 April 1785. On 2 July 1785, Swaroop Singh&#x27;s opponent Prince Regent Bahadur Shah was arrested, but on the eleventh day of imprisonment, on 13 July, Singh&#x27;s only supporter Queen Rajendra Laxmi died. Then onwards, Bahadur Shah took over the regency of his nephew King Rana Bahadur Shah and as one of his first orders as the regent, he ordered Swaroop Singh, who was then in Pokhara, to be beheaded there on the charges of treason. Singh had gone to Kaski to join Daljit Shah&#x27;s military campaign of Kaski fearing retaliation of the old courtiers due to his conspiracy against Vamsharaj. He was executed on B.S. 1842 Shrawan 24.

====Tibetan conflict====

After the death of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into what is present-day North India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed Tashi Lhunpo Monastery of Shigatse. Tibet sought Chinese help and the Qianlong Emperor of the Chinese Qing Dynasty appointed Fuk&#x27;anggan commander-in-chief of the Tibetan campaign. Heavy damages were inflicted on both sides. The Nepali forces retreated step by step back to Nuwakot to stretch Sino-Tibetan forces uncomfortably. Chinese launched an uphill attack during the daylight and failed to succeed due to a strong counterattack with khukuri at Nuwakot. The Chinese army suffered a major setback when they tried to cross a monsoon-flooded Betrawati, close to the Gorkhali palace in Nuwakot. A stalemate ensued when Fuk&#x27;anggan was keen to protect his troops and wanted to negotiate at Nuwakot. The treaty was favouring more to Chinese side where Nepal had to send tributes to the Chinese emperor.

===19th century===

====Dominance of Damodar Pande====
 
Damodar Pande was appointed as one of the four Kajis by King Rana Bahadur Shah after the removal of &quot;Chautariya&quot; Bahadur Shah in 1794. Pande was the most influential and dominant amongst the court factions in spite of the post of &quot;Mulkaji&quot; being held by Kirtiman Singh Basnyat. Pandes were the most dominant noble family. Later due to the continuous irrational behaviour of King Rana Bahadur Shah, a situation of civil war arose where Damodar was the main opposition to the King. He was forced to flee to the British-controlled city of Varanasi in May 1800 after the military parted with influential &quot;Kaji&quot; Damodar Pande. After Queen Rajrajeshwari finally managed to assume the regency on 17 December 1802, later in February she appointed Damodar Pande as the &quot;Mulkaji&quot;.
After Rana Bahadur&#x27;s reinstatement to power, he ordered Damodar Pande, along with his two eldest sons, who were completely innocent, to be executed on 13 March 1804; similarly, some members of his faction were tortured and executed without any due trial, while many others managed to escape to India. Among those who managed to escape to India were Damodar Pande&#x27;s sons Karbir Pande and Rana Jang Pande. After Damodar Pande&#x27;s execution, Ranajit Pande who was his paternal cousin, was appointed &quot;Mulkaji&quot; along with Bhimsen Thapa as second &quot;Kaji&quot;, Sher Bahadur Shah as &quot;Mul Chautariya&quot; and Ranganath Paudel as &quot;Raj Guru&quot; (Royal Preceptor).

====Thapa Regime====
Thapa courtiers, who were Kshatriya, rose to power when the King Rana Bahadur Shah was murdered by his half brother Sher Bahadur Shah in 1806. Bhimsen Thapa (1775–1839), the leading Thapa Kaji, taking opportunity of the occasion massacred nearly 55 military and civil officers and catapulting the Thapas into the power. He took the title of &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; succeeding Rana Bahadur as the chief authority and his niece Queen Tripurasundari as Queen Regent of junior King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah.

====Anglo-Nepalese War====

Rivalry between Nepal and the East India Company—over the princely states bordering Nepal and India—eventually led to the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Treaty of Sugauli was signed in 1816, ceding large parts of the Nepali territories of the Terai and Sikkim, which accounted to nearly one-third of the country, to the East India Company in exchange for Nepalese autonomy. As the territories were not restored to Nepal by the British government when India became independent from British rule, most of these lands later became a part of the Republic of India. Sikkim remained independent until annexed into India in 1975 when it becomes the 22nd state of the Republic of India. However, in 1860 the British returned the authority over some of Nepal&#x27;s land in the Terai back to Nepal (known as &quot;Naya Muluk&quot;, new country) as an act of gratitude for Nepalese support to Britain during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

====Rana Regime====
Factionalism among the royal family led to a period of instability after the war. In 1846, Queen Rajya Lakshmi Devi plotted to overthrow Jang Bahadur Rana, a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the Kot Massacre. However, Jung Bahadur emerged victorious eventually and founded the Rana dynasty; the monarch was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary, held by the Ranas.

==== Third Nepalese Tibet War ====

Jung Bahadur Rana sent forces under his brothers Bam Bahadur Kunwar and Dhir Shamsher Rana to attack Tibet again to achieve complete victory. His forces succeeded in defeating Tibetan forces on two sides. The Tibetan team arrived in January 1856 to sign a treaty. After a month, the Treaty of Thapathali was signed which was more favourable to Nepal.

===20th century===
==== Nepal and the British ====
The Rana regime, a tightly centralized autocracy, pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the British colonial era, but it also impeded the country&#x27;s economic development and modernisation. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and later in both World Wars. At the same time, despite Chinese claims, the British supported Nepalese independence at the beginning of the twentieth century.
In December 1923, Britain and Nepal formally signed a treaty of perpetual peace and friendship superseding the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 and upgrading the British resident in Kathmandu to an envoy. Slavery was abolished in Nepal in 1924.

====Democratic reform====
Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had studied in various Indian schools and colleges, and also from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic Rana occupation. The political parties such as the &quot;Praja Parishad&quot; and Nepali Congress were already formed in exile by leaders such as B.P. Koirala, Ganesh Man Singh, Subarna Shamsher Rana, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, Girija Prasad Koirala and many other patriotic-minded Nepalis who urged the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause, executed at the hands of the Ranas, were Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand. This turmoil culminated in King Tribhuvan, a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fleeing from his &#x27;palace prison&#x27; in 1950, to the newly independent India, touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This eventually ended in the return of the Shah family to power and the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of the quasi-constitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.
In early 1959, Tribhuvan&#x27;s son King Mahendra issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The Nepali Congress, a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. Koirala, formed a government and served as prime minister. After a period of power wrangling between the king and the elected government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in 1960.

====King Mahendra&#x27;s new constitution====

Declaring the contemporary parliament a failure, King Mahendra in 1960 dismissed the Koirala government, declared that a &quot;party-less&quot; Panchayat system would govern Nepal, and promulgated another new constitution on 16 December 1962.
Subsequently, the Prime Minister, members of parliament and hundreds of democratic activists were arrested. In fact, this trend of the arrest of political activists and democratic supporters continued for the entire 30-year period of the partyless Panchayat system under King Mahendra and then his son, King Birendra.
The new constitution established a &quot;partyless&quot; system of panchayats (councils), which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government, closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure, progressing from village assemblies to a Rastriya Panchayat (National Parliament), the panchayat system constitutionalised the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the cabinet (council of ministers) and the parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy, and all other languages suffered at the cost of the official language, Nepali, which was the king&#x27;s language.
King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27-year-old son, King Birendra, in 1972. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in 1979, King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal&#x27;s government: either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the Panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including a selection of the prime minister by the Rashtriya Panchayat.

===End of Panchayat system===
There was resentment against the authoritarian regime and the curbs on the freedom of the political parties. There was a widespread feeling of the palace being non-representative of the masses, especially when the Marich Man Singh government faced political scandals on charges of misappropriation of funds allotted for the victims of the earthquake in August 1998 or when it reshuffled the cabinet instead of investigating the deaths of the people in a stampede in the national sports complex in a hailstorm. Also, the souring of the India-Nepal trade relations affected the popularity of the Singh government.
In April 1987, Nepal had introduced the work permit for Indian workers in three of its districts, and in early 1989, Nepal provided 40% duty concession to Chinese goods and later withdrew duty concessions from Indian goods in such a manner that the Chinese goods became cheaper than the Indian goods. This led to the souring of relations which were already strained over the purchase of Chinese arms by Nepal in 1988. India refused to renew two separate Treaties of Trade and Transit and insisted on a single treaty dealing with the two issues, which was not acceptable to Nepal. A deadlock ensued and the Treaties of Trade and Transit expired on 23 March 1989. The brunt of the closure of the trade and transit points was mainly faced by the lower classes in Nepal due to the restricted supply of consumer goods and petroleum products such as petrol, aviation fuel and kerosene. The industries suffered because of their dependence on India for resources, trade and transit. The Government of Nepal tried to deal with the situation by depending on foreign aid from the US, UK, Australia and China. However, the government&#x27;s strategy to manage the crisis could not satisfy those people who desired negotiations with India rather than dependence on foreign aid as a solution.
Taking advantage of the uneasiness amongst some people against the government and the strained India-Nepal relations, the Nepali Congress (NC) and the left-wing parties blamed the government for perpetuating the crisis and not taking any serious measures to solve it. In December 1989, the NC tried to utilize B.P. Koirala&#x27;s anniversary by launching a people&#x27;s awareness program. The left-wing alliance known as the United Left Front (ULF) extended its support to the NC in its campaign for a party system. On 18–19 January 1990, the NC held a conference in which leaders from various countries and members of the foreign Press were invited. Leaders from India attended the conference; Germany, Japan, Spain, Finland supported the movement; and the Embassies of the US and West Germany were present on the occasion. Inspired by the international support and the democratic movements occurring throughout the world after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1989, the NC and the ULF launched a mass movement on 18 February to end the Panchayat regime and the installation of an interim government represented by various parties and people.
On 6 April the Marich Man Singh government was dismissed and Lokendra Bahadur Chand became the Prime Minister on the same day. However, the agitating mob was not satisfied with the change of government as they were not against the Singh government per se but against the party-less system. On 16 April the Chand government was also dismissed and a Royal Proclamation was issued the next day which dissolved the National Panchayat, the Panchayat policy and the evaluation committee and the class organizations. Instead, the proclamation declared &quot;functioning of the political parties&quot; and maintained that &quot;all political parties will always keep the national interest uppermost in organizing themselves according to their political ideology.&quot;&quot;&quot;
During this protest many civilians were killed; after the end of the Panchayat rule they were seen as &#x27;undeclared martyrs&#x27;. One of those martyrs is Ram Chandra Hamal, a member of the Nepali Congress and killed during his imprisonment.

===1990 People&#x27;s Movement===

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. The Nepali Congress with the support of &quot;Alliance of leftist parties&quot; decided to launch a decisive agitational movement, Jana Andolan, which forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. In May 1991, Nepal held its first parliamentary elections in nearly 50 years. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first elected government in 32 years.

====Civil strife====
In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiraling prices as a result of the implementation of changes in the policy of the new Congress government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People&#x27;s Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A general strike was called for 6 April.
Violent incidents began to occur on the evening before the strike. The Joint People&#x27;s Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute &#x27;lights out&#x27; in the capital, and violence erupted outside Bir Hospital when activists tried to enforce the &#x27;lights out&#x27;. At dawn on 6 April, clashes between strike activists and police, outside a police station in Pulchok (Patan), left two activists dead.
Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital Kathmandu was attacked by police forces. As a result, riots broke out and the Nepal Telecommunications building was set on fire; police opened fire at the crowd, killing several people. The Human Rights Organization of Nepal estimated that 14 people, including several onlookers, had been killed in police firing.
When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in Operation Romeo and Operation Kilo Sera II, which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

====Nepalese Civil War====

In February 1996, one of the Maoist parties started a bid to replace the parliamentary monarchy with a people&#x27;s new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the people&#x27;s war, which led to the Nepalese Civil War. Led by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai and Pushpa Kamal Dahal (better known by his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Prachanda&quot;), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: Rolpa, Rukum, Jajarkot, Gorkha, and Sindhuli. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional &quot;people&#x27;s government&quot; at the district level in several locations.

===21st century===

====Palace massacre====
On 1 June 2001, Crown Prince Dipendra allegedly went on a shooting-spree, assassinating 9 members of the royal family, including King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, before shooting himself. Due to his survival, he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds, after which Prince Gyanendra (Birendra&#x27;s brother) inherited the throne, according to tradition. The massacre shattered the aura of mythology that still surrounded the Royal Family, exposing their far too human intrigues.
Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country was still unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various clamouring political factions, the king&#x27;s attempts to take more control of the government, and worries about the competence of Gyanendra&#x27;s son and heir, Prince Paras.

====Suspension of responsible government====
In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On 1 February 2005, Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and took to exercising his executive powers without ministerial advice, declaring a &quot;state of emergency&quot; to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under house arrest, phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed.

====2006 democracy movement====
The king&#x27;s new regime made little progress in his stated aim of suppressing the insurgents. The European Union described the municipal elections of February 2006 as &quot;a backward step for democracy&quot;, as the major parties boycotted the election and the army forced some candidates to run for office. In April 2006 strikes and street protests in Kathmandu forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. As of 15 January 2007, a unicameral legislature under an interim constitution governed Nepal.

====Abolition of the monarchy====
The Constituent Assembly came to fruition on 24 December 2007 when it was announced that the monarchy would be abolished in 2008 after the Constituent Assembly elections; and on 28 May 2008, Nepal was declared a &quot;Federal Democratic Republic&quot;.

==Zones, districts, and regions==

Nepal was divided into 14 zones and 75 districts, grouped into 5 development regions:

The five development regions of Nepal were (from east to west):

Each district was headed by a fixed chief district officer responsible for maintaining law and order and coordinating the work of field agencies of the various government ministries. The 14 zones were:
==Government and politics==

Until 1990, Nepal was an absolute monarchy running under the executive control of the king. Faced with a people&#x27;s movement against the absolute monarchy, King Birendra, in 1990, agreed to large-scale political reforms by creating a parliamentary monarchy with the king as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of the government.
Nepal&#x27;s legislature was bicameral consisting of a House of Representatives and a National Council. The House of Representatives consists of 205 members directly elected by the people. The National Council had sixty members, ten nominated by the king, thirty-five elected by the House of Representatives and the remaining fifteen elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns. The legislature had a five-year term but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end. All Nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote.
The executive comprised the King and the Council of Ministers (the Cabinet). The leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the Prime Minister. The Cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Governments in Nepal have tended to be highly unstable; no government has survived for more than two years since 1991, either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister according to the constitution.
The movement in April 2006 brought about a change in the nation. The autocratic King was forced to give up power. The dissolved House of Representatives was restored. The House of Representatives formed a government that had successful peace talks with the Maoist Rebels. An interim constitution was promulgated and an interim House of Representatives was formed with Maoist members. The number of seats was also increased to 330. The peace process in Nepal made a giant leap in April 2007, when the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) joined the interim government of Nepal.

<text>Alexander Numenius (), or (according to the &quot;Suda&quot;) Alexander, son of Numenius (Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Νουμηνίου), was a Greek rhetorician who flourished in the first half of the 2nd century.

About his life almost nothing is known. We possess two works ascribed to him. The one which certainly is his work bears the title Περὶ τῶν τῆς διανοίας καὶ τῆς λέξεως σχημάτων Julius Rufinianus, in his work on the same subject expressly states that Aquila Romanus, in his Latin treatise &quot;De Figuris Sententiarum et Elocutionis&quot;, took his materials from Alexander&#x27;s work. Another epitome was made in the 4th century by a Christian for use in Christian schools, containing additional examples from Gregory Nazianzus.

The second work traditionally attributed to Alexander Numenius, titled &quot;On Show-Speeches&quot; (), is acknowledged by virtually all critics not the work of this Alexander, but of a later grammarian also named Alexander; that is, made up very clumsily from two distinct works, one of which was written by one Alexander, and the other by Menander Rhetor. The first edition of these two works is the Aldine edition (&quot;Rhetores Graeci&quot;, Venice, 1508, fol., vol. i. p. 574, &amp;c.). They are also contained in Walz&#x27;s &quot;Rhetores Graeci&quot;, vol. viii. The genuine work of Alexander Numenius has also been edited, together with Minucianus and Phoebammon, by L. Normann, with a Latin translation and useful notes, Upsala, 1690, 8vo.

<doc id="160199" wikidata="Q151773" url="?curid=160199" title="Constantine II of Greece">
<text>Constantine II (, ; 2 June 1940 – 10 January 2023) was the last king of Greece, reigning from 6 March 1964 until the abolition of the Greek monarchy on 1 June 1973.

Constantine was born in Athens as the only son of Crown Prince Paul and Crown Princess Frederica of Greece. Being of Danish descent, he was also born as a prince of Denmark. As his family was forced into exile during the Second World War, he spent the first years of his childhood in Egypt and South Africa. He returned to Greece with his family in 1946 during the Greek Civil War. After Constantine&#x27;s uncle, George II, died in 1947, Paul became the new king and Constantine the crown prince. As a young man, Constantine was a competitive sailor and Olympian, winning a gold medal in the 1960 Rome Olympics in the Dragon class along with Odysseus Eskitzoglou and George Zaimis in the yacht &quot;Nireus&quot;. From 1964, he served on the International Olympic Committee.

Constantine acceded as king following his father&#x27;s death in 1964. Later that year, he married Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, with whom he had five children. Although the accession of the young monarch was initially regarded auspiciously, his reign saw political instability that culminated in the Colonels&#x27; Coup of 21 April 1967. The coup left Constantine, as head of state, with little room to manoeuvre since he had no loyal military forces on which to rely. He thus reluctantly agreed to inaugurate the junta, on the condition that it be made up largely of civilian ministers. On 13 December 1967, Constantine was forced to flee the country, following an unsuccessful countercoup against the junta.

Constantine formally remained Greece&#x27;s head of state in exile until the junta abolished the monarchy in June 1973, a decision ratified via a referendum in July, which was contested by Constantine. After the restoration of democracy a year later, another referendum was called for December 1974, but Constantine was not allowed to return to Greece to campaign. The referendum confirmed by a majority of almost 70% the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Third Hellenic Republic. Constantine accepted the verdict of the 1974 vote. From 1975 until 1978 he was involved in conspiracies to overthrow the government via a coup, which eventually did not materialize. After living for several decades in London, Constantine moved back to Athens in 2013. He died there in 2023 following a stroke.
==Early life==

Constantine was born in the afternoon of 2 June 1940 at his parents&#x27; residence, Villa Psychiko at Leoforos Diamantidou 14 in Psychiko, an affluent suburb of Athens. He was the second child and only son of Crown Prince Paul and Crown Princess Frederica. His father was the younger brother and heir presumptive of the reigning Greek king, George II, and his mother was the only daughter of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, and Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia.

Prince Constantine had an elder sister, Princess Sofia, born in 1938. However, since agnatic primogeniture governed the succession to throne in Greece at the time, the birth of a male heir to the throne had been anxiously awaited by the Greek royal family, and the newborn prince was therefore received with joy by his parents. His birth was celebrated with a 101–gun salute from Mount Lycabettus in Athens, which, according to tradition, announced that the newborn was a boy. According to Greek naming practices, being the first son, he was named after his paternal grandfather, Constantine I, who had died in 1923. At his baptism on 20 July 1940 at the Royal Palace of Athens, the Hellenic Armed Forces acted as his godparent.

===World War II and the exile of the royal family===
Constantine was born during the early stages of World War II. He was just a few months old when, on 28 October 1940, Fascist Italy invaded Greece from Albania, beginning the Greco-Italian War. The Greek Army was able to halt the invasion temporarily and push the Italians back into Albania. However, the Greek successes forced Nazi Germany to intervene and the Germans invaded Greece and Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 and overran both countries within a month, despite British aid to Greece in the form of an expeditionary corps. On 22 April 1941, Princess Frederica and her two children, Sofia and Constantine, were evacuated to Crete in a British Short Sunderland flying boat along with most of the Greek royal family. The next day, they were followed by King George II and Prince Paul. However the imminent German invasion of Crete quickly made the situation untenable and Constantine and his family were evacuated from Crete to Egypt on 30 April 1941, a fortnight before the German attack on the island. In Alexandria, the exiled Greek royals were welcomed by the Greek diaspora, which provided them with lodging, money and clothing. The presence of the Greek royal family and government began to worry King Farouk of Egypt and his pro-Italian ministers. Constantine and his family, therefore, had to seek another refuge where they could get through the war and continue their fight against the Axis powers. George VI of the United Kingdom opposed the presence of Princess Frederica, who was suspected of having Nazi sympathies, and her children in Britain, but it was decided that Constantine&#x27;s father and uncle could take up residence in London, where a government-in-exile was set up, while the rest of the family could seek refuge in the then-Union of South Africa.

On 27 June 1941, most of the Greek royal family, therefore, set off for South Africa on board the Dutch steamship &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;, which arrived in Durban on 8 July 1941. After a two-month stay in Durban, Prince Paul left for England with his brother, and Constantine then barely saw his father again for the next three years. The rest of the family settled in Cape Town, where the family was joined by a younger sister, Princess Irene, born in 1942. Prince Constantine, Princess Sofia, their mother and their aunt Princess Katherine were initially lodged with South African Governor-General Patrick Duncan at his official residence Westbrooke in Cape Town.

The group subsequently moved several times until they settled in Villa Irene in Pretoria with Prime Minister Jan Smuts, who quickly became a close friend of the exiled Greeks. From early 1944, the family again took up residence in Egypt. In January 1944, Frederica was reunited with Paul in Cairo, and their children joined them in March of that year. Despite their difficult financial circumstances, the family then established friendly relations with several Egyptian personalities, including Queen Farida, whose daughters were roughly the same age as Constantine and his sisters.

===After World War II and return to Greece===

In 1944, at the end of World War II, Nazi Germany gradually withdrew from Greece. While the majority of exiled Greeks were able to return to their country, the royal family had to remain in exile because of the growing republican opposition at home. Britain tried to reinstate George II, who remained in exile in London, but most of the resistance, in particular the communists, were opposed. Instead, George had to appoint from exile a Regency Council headed by Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens, who immediately appointed a republican-majority government headed by Nikolaos Plastiras. George, who was humiliated, ill and powerless, considered abdicating for a time in favour of his brother, but eventually decided against it.

Prince Paul, who was more combative but also more popular than his brother, would have liked to return to Greece as heir to the throne as early as the liberation of Athens in 1944, as he believed that back in his country he would have been quickly proclaimed regent, which would have blocked the way for Damaskinos and made it easier to restore the monarchy.

However, the unstable situation in the country and the polarisation between communists and bourgeois allowed the monarchists to return to power after the parliamentary elections of March 1946. After becoming prime minister, Konstantinos Tsaldaris organised a referendum on 1 September 1946 with the aim of allowing George to return to the throne. The majority in the referendum was in favour of reinstating the monarchy, at which time Constantine and his family also returned to Greece. In a country still suffering from rationing and deprivation, they moved back to the villa in Psychikó. It was there that Paul and Frederica chose to start a small school, where Constantine and his sisters received their first education under the supervision of Jocelin Winthrop Young, a British disciple of the German-Jewish educator Kurt Hahn.

The tension between communists and conservatives led, in the following years, to the Greek Civil War. That conflict was fought mainly in northern Greece. The Civil War ended in 1949, with the victory of the bourgeois and royalists, who had been supported by Britain and the United States.

==Crown Prince==
===Education===

During the Civil War, on 1 April 1947, George died. Thus, Constantine&#x27;s father ascended the throne, and Constantine himself became Crown Prince of Greece at the age of six. He then moved with his family from the villa in Psychiko to Tatoi Palace at the foot of the Parnitha Mountains in the northern part of the Attica peninsula.

The first years of Paul&#x27;s reign did not bring great upheavals in his son&#x27;s daily life. Constantine and his sisters were brought up relatively simply, and communication was at the heart of the pedagogy of their parents, who spent all the time they could with their children. Supervised by various British governesses and tutors, the children spoke English in the family but were also fluent in Greek. Until he was nine, Constantine continued to be educated with his sisters and other companions from Athens&#x27; wealthier population in the villa at Psychiko.

After that age, Paul decided to begin preparing his son for the throne. He then started at the Anávryta lyceum in Marousi, northeast of Athens, which also followed Kurt Hahn&#x27;s pedagogy. He attended school there as a boarder between 1950 and 1958, while his sisters attended school in Salem, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. From 1955, Constantine served in all three branches of the Hellenic Armed Forces, attending the requisite military academies. He also attended the NATO Air Force Special Weapons School in Germany, as well as the University of Athens, where he took courses in the school of law. In 1955, he received the title of Duke of Sparta.

===Sailing and the Olympic Games===

Constantine was an able sportsman. In 1958, Paul gave his son a Lightning class sailing boat for Christmas. Subsequently, Constantine spent most of his free time training with the boat on the Saronic Gulf. After a few months, the Greek Navy gave the prince a Dragon class sailing boat, with which he decided to participate in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. At the opening of the Games in Rome, he was the flag bearer for the Greek team. He won an Olympic gold medal in the Dragon event, which was the first Greek gold medal since the Stockholm 1912 Summer Olympics. Constantine was the helmsman of their Olympic gold-winning sailing vessel &quot;Nireus&quot;, and other members of the team included Odysseus Eskitzoglou and Georgios Zaimis.

Constantine was also a strong swimmer and had a black belt in karate, with interests in squash, track events, and riding. In 1963, Constantine became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). He resigned in 1974 because he was no longer a Greek resident, and was made an honorary IOC member. He was an honorary member of the International Soling Association and president of the International Dragon Association.

==Reign==
===Accession and marriage===

In 1964, Paul&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer and underwent surgery for an ulcer in February. Prior to this, Constantine had already been appointed regent for his ailing father while waiting for his recovery. During his regency, Constantine limited himself to signing decrees and appointing members of the government, as well as accepting their resignations. As the king&#x27;s condition worsened, the crown prince went to Tinos to attain an icon considered miraculous by the Greek Orthodox Church. On 6 March 1964, Paul died and the 23-year-old Constantine succeeded him as King of the Hellenes. The new king ascended the throne as Constantine II, although some of his supporters preferred to call him Constantine XIII to emphasize the continuity between the former Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Greece. On 23 March 1964, he was sworn in before the parliament and was invested as chief of the armed forces with the highest ranks in each branch.

Due to his youth, Constantine was also perceived as a promise of change. Greece was still feeling the effects of the Civil War and society was strongly polarised between the royalist-conservative right wing and the liberal-socialist left wing. The accession of Constantine came shortly after the election of centrist George Papandreou as prime minister in February 1964, which ended 11 years of right-wing rule by the National Radical Union (ERE). The Greek society hoped that the new king and the new prime minister would be able to overcome past dissensions. Later that year, on 18 September, Constantine married Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark in a Greek Orthodox ceremony in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. Anne-Marie was the youngest daughter of King Frederik IX, and she and Constantine were third cousins.

===Apostasia of 1965===

Constantine succeeded to the throne at a time when Greek society was experiencing economic and employment growth, but also political crises and violent social protests. Political instability worsened in 1965. At a meeting with Papandreou that took place on 11 July 1965 in Korfu, Constantine requested that those implicated in the ASPIDA scandal, in which several military officials tried to prevent attempts by the extreme right-wing military to seize power, be referred to a military tribunal. Papandreou agreed and raised with him his intention to dismiss the then minister of defence, Petros Garoufalias, so that he could take charge himself of the ministry. Constantine refused, as the scandal wrongly implicated the prime minister&#x27;s son, Andreas Papandreou. After several clashes by letter between the monarch and the prime minister, Papandreou resigned on 15 July. Following the resignation, at least 39 members of Parliament left Center Union.

Constantine appointed a new government led by Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas, speaker of the parliament, which was formed by defectors disaffected with the Papandreous (the &#x27;Apostates&#x27;). Soon, thousands of citizens took to the streets to protest against Constantine&#x27;s decision, unprecedented protests that led to clashes with the Cities Police. On 21 July 1965, the protests in the centre of Athens came to a head, and in one of these clashes a policeman killed the 25-year-old student Sotiris Petroulas, leader of the student movement and of the &quot;Lambrakis Youth&quot;. His death became a symbol of the protests and his funeral was widely attended. Due to Constantine&#x27;s personal involvement and his clash with Papandreou, the protests -the largest, most persistent and combative since 1944- featured explicitly anti-monarchical slogans and the monarchy turned into a point of contention. Athanasiadis-Novas&#x27;s government did not receive a vote of confidence from parliament and Athanasiadis-Novas resigned on 5 August 1965. The two big parties, National Radical Union and Center Union, asked Constantine to call elections, but he asked Stefanos Stefanopoulos to form a government. He then ordered Ilias Tsirimokos to form a government on 18 August but he did not receive the vote of confidence of the parliament on a vote on 28 August either. Constantine finally ordered Stefanopoulos to form a government and obtained the parliamentary confidence on 17 December 1965. An end to the crisis seemed in sight when on 20 December 1966, Papandreou, ERE leader Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and the king reached a resolution; elections would be held under a straightforward system of proportional representation where all parties participating agreed to compete, and that, in any outcome, the command structure of the army would not be altered. The third &quot;apostate&quot; government fell on 22 December 1966, and was succeeded by Ioannis Paraskevopoulos, who was to govern until the parliamentary elections of 28 May 1967, which were expected to favour a victory for Georgios Papandreou&#x27;s Centre Union. Paraskevopoulos resigned and Kanellopoulos stepped in to fill the role of the Prime Minister on 3 April 1967 until the election.

===Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974===
Historians have suspected that Constantine and his mother were interested in a coup d&#x27;état from mid-1965 at the latest. US Army Attaché Charles Perkins reported that military right-wing group &quot;Sacred Bond of Greek Officers&quot; (IDEA) &quot;plans for coup and military dictatorship in Greece&quot;, that Constantine was aware and that the group was aware that any operation in this direction with the cooperation of the US must have the permission of the king. According to Charilaos Lagoudakis, a US State Department expert on Greece, by mid-1966 Constantine had already approved a coup plan. On the other hand, Conservative MP C.M. Woodhouse rejects as &quot;certainly untrue&quot; source evidence that in his talks with Talbot Constantine considered establishing a dictatorship, a stance that historian Mogens Pelt attributes to royalist Woodhouse&#x27;s wish to salvage the king&#x27;s reputation.

A traditionalist, right-wing nationalist group of middle-ranking army officers led by Colonel George Papadopoulos took action first and staged a coup d&#x27;état on 21 April using the fear of &quot;communist danger&quot; as the main reason for the coup. Tanks rolled through the streets of Athens, rifle shots were heard and military songs were played on the radio until the announcement that &quot;The Hellenic Armed Forces have undertaken the governance of the country&quot; was made public. Some high-ranking politicians were arrested, as well as the commander-in-chief of the army. The coup leaders met Constantine at his residence in Tatoi at about 7 a.m, which was surrounded by tanks to prevent resistance and the coup seemed to have succeeded bloodlessly. Constantine later recounted that the officers of the tank platoons believed they were carrying out the coup under his orders. They asked Constantine to swear in the new government. Despite the detained Prime Minister Knellopoulos urging resistance, Constantine compromised with them to avoid bloodshed and in the afternoon swore in a new military government. He did, however, insist on appointing Supreme Court prosecutor Konstantinos Kollias as prime minister. On 26 April, in his speech on the new regime, he affirmed that &quot;I am sure that with the will of God, with your efforts and above all with the help of the people, the organization of a State of Law, an authentic and healthy democracy&quot;. According to the then-US ambassador to Greece, Phillips Talbot, Constantine expressed his anger at this situation, revealed to him that he no longer had control of the army and claimed that &quot;incredibly stupid extreme right-wing bastards with control of the tanks are leading Greece to destruction&quot;.

From his inauguration as king, Constantine already manifested his disagreements with Archbishop Chrysostomos II of Athens. With the military dictatorship, he had the opportunity to be removed from the Greek Orthodox Cephaly, in fact it was one of the first measures with which Constantine collaborated with the Junta. On 28 April 1967, Chrysostomos II was retained and was forced to resign after having to sign one of the two versions of the letter brought to him by an official of the royal palace. Finally, Ieronymos Kotsonis was elected as metropolitan by the junta&#x27;s and Constantine&#x27;s proposal on 13 May 1967.

===Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile===
From the outset, the relationship between Constantine and the regime of the colonels was an uneasy one, especially when he refused to sign the decree imposing martial law and asked Talbot to flee Greece in an American helicopter with his family. But the administration of US president Lyndon B. Johnson wanted to keep Constantine in Greece to negotiate with the junta for the return of democracy. The presence of the United States Sixth Fleet in the Aegean Sea outraged the junta government, which forced Constantine to get rid of his private secretary, . Arnaoutis, who had served as the king&#x27;s military instructor in the 1950s and became his close friend, was generally reviled among the public for his role in the palace intrigues of the previous years. The junta, considering him an able and dangerous plotter, dismissed him from the army. The king and his entourage were beginning to worry that the future of the monarchy was endangered. Constantine visited the United States in the following days and in a meeting with Johnson, Constantine asked for military aid for a countercoup he was planning, but without success. The junta, however, had information about Constantine&#x27;s conspiracy. Constantine later described himself as having the idea of a countercoup ten minutes after he found out about the junta&#x27;s rise to power.
Constantine began negotiations with the officials loyal to him in the summer of 1967. His objective was to mobilise the units of the army loyal to him and to restore parliamentary legitimacy. The action was planned by Lieutenant General Konstantinos Dovas. Several military authorities joined the plan, including lieutenant general Antonakos, chief of the air force, Konstantinos Kollias, lieutenant general Kechagias, Ioannis Manettas, brigadier generals Erselman and Vidalis, major general Zalochoris, and others, so it was expected that the counterattack would be successful. The king communicated with Konstantinos Karamanlis, who was exiled in Paris and aware of the plot, and attempted to persuade him return to assume the post of prime minister if this movement was successful, but he refused. The main objective of the plan drawn up by the movement was that all the units initiated would occupy Thessaloniki and the king would send a message to the public. It would follow the military operations in Tempi, Larissa and Lamia by the army and the swearing in of a new government by Archbishop Ieronymos with the participation of the centrist Georgios Mavros. Constantine and the involved officials began to realise that the plan could fail as they didn&#x27;t count on the active support of American intelligence, who were aware of the details of the plan. They intended to initiate their plan on the day of a military parade scheduled for 28 October, but the junta-installed Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff, Odysseas Angelis, refused to mobilise the units that Georgios Peridis requested. The abortive attempt, along with the visit of Constantine together with Peridis to some military divisions, were noted by the junta.

On the morning of the day the countercoup had been rescheduled to, 13 December 1967, after eight months of planning the countercoup, the royal family flew to Kavala, east of Thessaloniki, accompanied by Prime Minister Konstantinos Kollias who was informed at that moment of Constantine&#x27;s plan. They arrived at 11:30 a.m. and were well received by the citizens. But some conspirators were neutralised, such as General Manettas, and Odysseas Angelis informed the public of the plan, asking citizens to obey his orders minutes before telecommunications were cut off. By noon, all the airbases, except one in Athens, had joined the royalist movement, and fleet leader Vice Admiral Dedes, before being arrested, ordered successfully the whole fleet sail towards Kavala in obedience to the king. They did not manage to take Thessaloniki and it soon became apparent that the senior officers were not in control of their units. This, along with the arrest of several officers, including the capture of Peridis that afternoon, and the delay in the execution of some orders, led to the countercoup&#x27;s failure.

The junta, led by Georgios Papadopoulos, on the same day appointed General Georgios Zoitakis as Regent of Greece. Archbishop Ieronymos swore Zoitakis into office in Athens. Constantine, the royal family and Konstantinos Kollias took off in torrential rain from Kavala for exile in Rome, where they arrived at 4 p.m. on 14 December, with their plane having only five minutes of fuel left. In 2004, Constantine said that he would have done everything the same, but with more caution. Two weeks after his exile, photos of Constantine and his family celebrating Christmas with normality in the Greek Ambassador to Italy&#x27;s home reached Greek media, which didn&#x27;t do Constantine&#x27;s reputation &quot;any favour&quot;. He remained in exile in Italy through the rest of military rule, although he technically continued as king until 1 June 1973. He was never to return to Greece as a reigning monarch.
Constantine stated, &quot;I am sure I shall go back the way my ancestors did.&quot; He said to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;:

I consider myself King of the Hellenes and sole expression of legality in my country until the Greek people freely decide otherwise. I fully expected that the (military) regime would depose me eventually. They are frightened of the Crown because it is a unifying force among the people.

Throughout the dictatorship, Constantine maintained contact with the junta, maintaining direct communication with the colonels and kept the royal subsidy until 1973. On 21 March 1972, Papadopoulos became Regent. At the end of May 1973, senior officers of the Greek navy organised an abortive coup to overthrow the junta government, but failed. The dictators considered Constantine to be involved, so on 1 June, with a constitutional act, Papadopoulos declared the monarchy abolished. He converted the country into a presidential and parliamentary state and assumed the interim presidency of the republic. In June 1973, Papadopoulos condemned Constantine as &quot;a collaborator with foreign forces and with murderers&quot; and accused him of &quot;pursuing ambitions to become a political leader&quot;. The referendum of 29 July confirmed the end of the Greek monarchy and the end of the reign of Constantine. That year, the junta expropriated the palace of Tatoi and offered the king 120 million drachmas, money that Constantine refused.

==Restoration of democracy and the referendum==

The Turkish invasion of Cyprus led to the downfall of the military regime, and Konstantinos Karamanlis returned from exile to become prime minister. The 1973 republican constitution was regarded as illegitimate, and the new administration issued a decree restoring the 1952 constitution. Constantine expected an invitation to return. On 24 July, he declared his &quot;deep satisfaction with the initiative of the armed forces in overthrowing the dictatorial regime&quot; and welcomed the advent of Karamanlis as prime minister.

Following the appointment of a civilian government in November 1974 after the first post-junta legislative election, Karamanlis called a referendum, held on 8 December 1974, on whether Greece would restore the monarchy or remain a republic. Although he had been the leader of the traditionally monarchist right, Karamanlis made no attempt to encourage a vote in favour of restoring the monarch. The king was not allowed by the government to return to Greece to campaign for the restoration of constitutional monarchy. He was only allowed to broadcast to the Greek people from London on television. Analysts claim this was a deliberate act by the government to reduce the possibility of a vote in favour of restoration.

Constantine, speaking from London, said he had made mistakes in the past. He said he would always be supportive of democracy in future and promised that his mother would stay away from the country. Local monarchists campaigned on his behalf. The vote to restore the monarchy was only about 31% with most of the support coming from the Peloponnese region. Almost 69% of the electorate voted against the restoration of the monarchy and for the establishment of a republic.

==Post-reign==
Constantine remained in exile for 40 years after the vote in favour of the republic, living in Italy and the United Kingdom. He returned briefly for the first time in February 1981, which was to attend the funeral of his mother in the family cemetery of the former Royal Palace at Tatoi. The funeral was generally controversial, due to the little empathy generated by Queen Frederica and the royal family, which is why the government authorized him to stay only for six hours in the country. His gesture of kissing the ground upon arrival in Greece was also polemic as it was considered an act of provocation for the antiroyalists.

===Abortive conspiracies===

The posthumously published archives of Konstantinos Karamanlis, as well as the memoirs of Constantine&#x27;s former marshal of the court, , revealed that from 1975 to 1978, Constantine was involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the democratic government, including the assassination of Karamanlis and a followed referendum on the monarchy. Constantine&#x27;s close confidant, Michail Arnaoutis, approached high-ranking officers to try to gain their support. After some naval officers approached expressed doubts that Arnaoutis spoke for the former king, the chief engineer of the fleet was invited to London, where Constantine confirmed the basic outline of the plot as relayed by Arnaoutis. The naval officers approached informed Karamanlis, who sent Papagos to warn Constantine to &quot;stop conspiring&quot; and the former monarch denied knowledge of the conspiracy, but when called upon, Arnaoutis confirmed his contacts with officers in Greece in the presence of both Constantine and Papagos. The events were confirmed in 1999 by one of the officers whom Arnaoutis had approached, Vice Admiral Ioannis Vasileiadis, after the publication of Papagos&#x27; memoirs. According to Vasileiadis, Arnaoutis said that Constantine had contacted the Shah of Iran in order to prevent possible Turkish military action during the coup.

Karamanlis was also alerted to Constantine&#x27;s suspicious activities by the British secret services, who had apparently taped his conversations with Greek visitors. In October 1976, the Greek prime minister was informed by the British ambassador that Constantine, while not the driving force behind the conspiracy, was very much aware of it and did nothing to discourage it. The British also provided warnings that sympathizers had informed Constantine that a coup would take place in November 1976, led by low-ranking army officers loyal to former dictator Dimitrios Ioannidis. Karamanlis and his chief diplomatic adviser, Petros Molyviatis, applied pressure on both the British and US governments, which led to a personal intervention by British prime minister James Callaghan, who warned Constantine off. The Greek government repeatedly sent envoys to the former king for the same purpose, but he denied any knowledge of the affair. Karamanlis chose not to publicise it in order to not destabilise the fragile democratic system in Greece. Nevertheless, in October 1978, Constantine and Arnaoutis were recorded by Greek agents to have sought contact with military and political leaders, trying to win them over to the cause of a royal restoration.

===Visits to Greece===
====12 February 1981====
The first visit of Constantine and the former royal family to Greece took place on 12 February 1981, on the occasion of the funeral of his mother, Frederica. She had died in Madrid on 6 February, and it was the wish of both her and her descendants that she be buried next to her husband in the cemetery of Tatoi. As soon as Constantine&#x27;s communication with the government of then Prime Minister George Rallis about the details of the funeral became known to the press, an intense political dispute erupted. Only six years had passed since the referendum and the controversies between the two sides - pro-royalist and anti-royalist - were still fresh. The opposition even raised the issue of a burial ban, a demand that was clearly illegal but indicative of the polarisation that existed. The Rallis government was therefore asked to find a compromise solution.
Although the royal entourage&#x27;s preference for a lay-in-state ceremony in Athens metropolitan cathedral followed by a burial in Tatoi, the Rallis government, in the midst of fierce confrontations with the opposition, decided that both the funeral and the burial should take place in Tatoi to avoid the possibility of violent clashes between pro- and anti-royal supporters. Constantine and his family could only stay on Greek soil for six hours, as long as they needed to carry out their duties. The former royal family arrived at Ellinikon airport and Constantine disembarked, bent down and kissed the ground. This token gesture added new fuel to the controversy, with some interpreting it as genuine love of country and others as hypocrisy. The funeral and burial took place under police protection. However, the police were unable to keep the crowds of supporters of the former king away from the site.

====August 1993====
At the funeral of King Baudouin of Belgium, a private agreement was made between Constantine and the new conservative Greek prime minister, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, that allowed Constantine and his family to temporarily return to Greece on a holiday. Constantine was accompanied by his wife Anne-Marie, their five children, and his sister Irene. The family had decided that yachting around Greece would be the best way to showcase the country to their children, who were unable to grow up within Greece. The opposition claimed that the government was attempting to reinstate the monarchy. On 9 August 1993, the family departed from the UK on two planes, including a jet donated to Constantine by King Hussein of Jordan. The Greek government was unaware of Constantine and his family&#x27;s holiday, which had been planned and charted by Princess Alexia. Constantine, and then his family a few hours later, landed in Thessaloniki, before boarding a yacht.

The family&#x27;s yacht then travelled 300 metres off the shore of Mount Athos. Constantine and his two eldest sons, Crown Prince Pavlos and Prince Nikolaos, travelled upon a dingy to get to the mainland, where women were unallowed to visit. Upon arriving, Constantine noticed his portrait in every monastery and learnt that the monks there had been praying for him every day since his exile. Nine monks followed Constantine back to their yacht to bless the rest of his family, display holy relics and present gifts. Constantine then took a helicopter and landed on a soccer pitch in Florina, where &quot;hundreds&quot; of people greeted him with handshakes and flowers. Constantine&#x27;s decision to land in Florina was named a &quot;politically sensitive spot to appear in&quot; in view of the region&#x27;s greater support for the monarchy over other regions and due to the Macedonia naming dispute. Constantine and his family took a van north in order see the northernmost part of Greece, and were reportedly followed by between 50 and 100 cars. However, the Greek government had organised for the police to block the road, claiming that Constantine&#x27;s journey was &quot;a political step&quot;, rather than touristic. Protestors attempted to open up the road, but failed. In the next village the family stopped at, a local government official told Constantine that he would be kicked out of Greece if he did not act like a tourist.

Following this clash between police and protestors in support of Constantine, Mitsotakis made a public statement explaining that the government &quot;had no prior knowledge of the visit and had never agreed to it. Strong action will be taken if the ex-king violates our conditions.&quot; Afterwards, Constantine and his family returned to Athens to visit Tatoi Palace and his parents&#x27; graves, where a short memorial service was held. During this trip, Constantine chose where his future tomb would be. Telling Sky News presenter Selina Scott, Constantine said that having to leave his belongings when going into exile taught him that &quot;material things are not that important&quot;. He also expressed his wishes to move back into the property and clean up the land surrounding it. Constantine was then warned by the government to move on from Tatoi and alerted them of protestors who were threatening to burn Tatoi&#x27;s forestry down.

Whilst travelling to Spetses, the government ordered that Constantine should not travel to heavily populated areas, to which Constantine said, &quot;It&#x27;s a free country&quot;. When he arrived at a port in Spetses, a harbour policeman jumped onto their boat, but Constantine pushed him to the side and set foot on the mainland. A crowd greeted Constantine and his family, but at night and during the following day, their yacht was surrounded by government ships and flown over by military planes. Constantine then contacted Sky News UK and was interviewed by presenter David Blaine, to whom Constantine told on live air that he was being harassed by the government, who had &quot;frightened the daylights&quot; out of his children. Constantine&#x27;s yacht was on course to stop at Gytheio, where a reported 5,000 to 10,000 people were waiting for him. Military warships were denying the yacht&#x27;s progress towards the town, so Constantine stopped in Neapoli Voion, where there was a crowd of a few hundred people, but also many anti-monarchists. Following this stop, Constantine and his family returned to the UK.

===Legal quarrels over the royal properties===
====Properties and citizenship====

A long-standing dispute between the former royal family and the Greek state over the ownership of movable and immovable property which, prior to the constitutional change of the Metapolitefsi, was considered to be the property of King Constantine was resolved in 2002. The European Court of Human Rights condemned Greece for violating Article 1 of the First Protocol and awarded the former royal family compensation of €13.7 million. The legal basis of the dispute was determined by the interpretation of royal property as private or public. According to the royal family, the property was acquired by their predecessors through legal means (purchases) from their personal estates and was therefore considered the inheritance of the former king. In the eyes of the Greek public, however, the property was a by-product of the institution of the monarchy and served to enable the supreme ruler to exercise his role as monarch. With the demise of the monarchy, the property should automatically pass to the state.

In 1973, Decree No. 225 expropriated the movable and immovable property of the former king and members of the royal family for the benefit of the state. In September 1974, the government of National Salvation, headed by Constantine Karamanlis revoked the junta&#x27;s decree in anticipation of the referendum that would determine the country&#x27;s constitution. Although the referendum abolished the monarchy, the government did not proceed with the confiscation of property. Instead, it set up a seven-member commission to administer the property. This committee later handed over its responsibilities to the legal representative of the royal family in Greece, retired admiral Mario Stavridis. Thus, members of the royal family continued to declare their property as inherited and to file inheritance and income tax returns, and the tax administration continued to assess taxes and impose surcharges and fines. In 1984, Constantine took the initiative to approach the Greek government to settle the former royal family&#x27;s tax debts to the Greek state. An agreement was finally reached in 1992, under the government of Konstantinos Mitsotakis with Law 2086/1992. The agreement - which was never implemented - included the payment by the royal family of 183,000,000 drachmas in cash from the total amount of inheritance tax due, while the rest was to be covered by the concession of 200 acres to the state, 400 acres to the &quot;World Hippocratic Hospital Foundation and Research Centre&quot; to be built a huge hospital complex, and 37,426 acres to the &quot;Tatoi National Park&quot;. In the agreement there was no specific provision for the so-called &quot;summer palace&quot; of Tatoi, for Mon Repo, for Polydendri and for mobile things. All these were considered the King&#x27;s property.

In 1993, on the occasion of the visit of the royal family to Greece, Andreas Papandreou announced the legislative settlement of the outstanding issues. In fact, on the basis of the consultative document drafted by Evangelos Venizelos for the Municipality of Corfu to strengthen their claim to Mon Repos, when PASOK returned to power under, it abolished the previous law and replaced it with 2215/1994. The Law confiscated the King&#x27;s property for the benefit of the state without the right to compensation and deprived the members of the royal family of their Greek citizenship. The royal family immediately appealed to the country&#x27;s civil courts. Although upheld by the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece, the decision was overturned by the Council of State. The Special Highest Court, to which the case was referred in 1997, agreed with the Council of State. All legal remedies in Greece had been depleted. The royal family therefore turned to the European courts.

An appeal to the European Commission of Human Rights was lodged by Constantine, Anna-Marie, their five children, Princess Irene and Princess Catherine. His sister, Queen Sophia, did not take part because she had already renounced her rights to the estate. The court allowed the appeal, but only for Constantine, Irene and Catherine. In October 1998, the European Commission admitted the property issue when all 30 judges unanimously ruled that human rights had been violated and referred the matter to the European Court of Human Rights. Constitutional lawyer Nikos Alivizatos, a member of the team of lawyers who represented the Greek State in the trial, pointed out that the trial was considered historic, as it was the most important property case to come before them. The former royal family challenged the expropriation without compensation of 42,000 acres in Tatoi, 230 acres in Corfu and 33,000 acres in Polydendri, Larissa. The total amount demanded by the former king was 168.7 billion drachmas. The court also encouraged six months of meetings between Constantine and the Greek government to coordinate a settlement, however the Greek government refused. The court also defined the former king&#x27;s litigation assets as private, ruling that the property that accompanied the institution of the monarchy had already been automatically transferred to the state, meaning that the Greek state could award Constantine monetary compensation, rather than returning his royal properties. The Greek State was therefore obliged to compensate the plaintiffs, setting the appropriate compensation at 1/40th of the amount claimed, i.e. 4.7 billion drachmas (13.7 million euro). The money was collected in March 2003. With the compensation, the former king set up the &quot;Anna Maria Foundation&quot; to allocate the funds back to the Greek people for use in &quot;extraordinary natural disasters&quot; and charitable causes.

The court decision also ruled that Constantine&#x27;s human rights were not violated by the Greek state&#x27;s decision not to grant him Greek citizenship and passport unless he adopts a surname. Constantine said of this &quot;the law basically said that I had to go out and acquire a name. The problem is that my family originates from Denmark and the Danish royal family haven&#x27;t got a surname.&quot; Constantine and his family ultimately did not receive their Greek citizenship back. Although originally requesting Spanish citizenships, Anne-Marie eventually requested of her sister, Margrethe II of Denmark, to have Danish diplomatic passports instated in the names of the members of the Greek royal family. She agreed and in their Danish passports, Constantine and Anne-Marie&#x27;s names were established as &quot;HM King Constantine II&quot; and &quot;HM Queen Anne-Marie&quot;. On 20 December 2024, over two decades after the court ruling and almost two years after Constantine&#x27;s death, his descendants received Greek citizenship upon adopting the surname &quot;De Grèce&quot; (Ντε Γκρες; &quot;of Greece&quot;), which had been used by Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark, a first cousin of Constantine&#x27;s father.

====Movable property====
On 8 October 1990, the commissioner of the Royal Estate, Admiral Stavridis, submitted a request for the transfer of the family&#x27;s &quot;households goods&quot; abroad. After secret talks with then Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, the government accepted the former king&#x27;s request and on 22 November, the Greek Minister for the Economy, Ioannis Palaiokrassas, and the Minister for Culture, Tzannis Tzannetakis, issued a joint ministerial decision in order to check, register and mark the objects in the collection which were probably prohibited from leaving the country. In February 1991, when the transfer process began, customs officials, an archaeologist and a representative of the National Gallery carried out the registration of the objects. This work was characterized by haste and sloppiness, and did not meet scientific standards. Nevertheless, the list was submitted to the National Gallery in April 1992, although it has not been used for cross-checking since. On 17 February 1991, nine containers weighing 32 tonnes and containing 1904 boxes were loaded onto a ship leaving Piraeus for the port of Tilbury and the former royal residence in London. 
When a dock worker at the port alerted the newspapers to the transfer, it became public knowledge, and a heated debate ensued. The opposition claimed that underworld methods had been used, as Parliament had not been informed and all discussions and negotiations had taken place in secret, while public discourse questioned the legality of the transfer and assurances that it would not affect the public interest.
What further discredited the operation of transferring the heirlooms was when it was revealed, 10 years later, that on 13 February 1991, while the place was under guard, a major break-in and robbery of objects of incalculable value took place. The list of stolen goods included jewellery, valuable religious icons, works of art and objects that were classified as unique works of cultural heritage and could not be legally exported. However, both the Hellenic Police and Konstantinos&#x27; entourage concealed the fact and did not take legal action to solve the theft. 

In 2007, 850 valuable objects belonging to the royal estate were auctioned by Christie&#x27;s in London. Constantine denied that he was the vendor - he claimed that they had already been sold in 1991 to third parties who auctioned them but journalists disputed the claim. The Greek government, through then Culture Minister Georgios Voulgarakis, tried to stop the auction, claiming that the items may have been illegally exported from Greece, but the attempt failed.

==Later life==
Following the abolition of the monarchy, Constantine repeatedly stated that he recognised the republic, the laws and the constitution of Greece. He told &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;If the Greek people decide that they want a republic, they are entitled to have that and should be left in peace to enjoy it.&quot; Constantine and Anne-Marie for many years lived in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London. Constantine was a close friend of his second cousin Charles III, then Prince of Wales, and a godfather to Charles&#x27;s son, Prince William. Constantine&#x27;s 60th birthday lunch marked the first time that Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles were seen in public together in a relationship. In 2004, Constantine returned to Greece temporarily during the Athens Olympic Games as a member of the International Olympic Committee. Later that year, when asked whether he thought he would be the last monarch of Greece, Constantine said that it is &quot;very hard&quot; to determine the future. Constantine served as patron of Box Hill School, a private school in Mickleham, in the south of England until his death.

According to a nationwide 2007 survey of 2,040 households in Greece conducted on behalf of the newspaper &quot;To Vima&quot;, only 11.6% supported a constitutional monarchy. More than half of the respondents, 50.9%, considered that the dictatorship of the junta had brought benefits to Greece. During the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, Constantine, in his role as honorary member of the International Olympic Committee, was the official presenter at the sailing medal ceremonies. He was Co-President of Honour of the International Sailing Federation, along with Harald V of Norway, from 1994 on.

In 2013, Constantine pledged in an interview with CNN that he would never become involved in restoring the monarchy. When asked by reporter Richard Quest whether he was content with never becoming the monarch again, Constantine said, &quot;If the Greek people are happy with the system they have today, why should I be the one to change it? Just because I would like to be a king again? That would be crazy.&quot; Later that same year, Constantine returned to reside in Greece after selling his Hampstead house. From 2015 they lived in a villa in the coastal resort town of Porto Cheli in Argolis in the Peloponnese peninsula. In November 2015, his autobiography was published in three volumes by the national newspaper, &quot;To Vima&quot;. On 10 January 2022, he was admitted to the hospital after testing positive for COVID-19, which he had been fully vaccinated against.

===Death===
Constantine suffered multiple health problems in his final years, including heart conditions and decreased mobility. On 6 January 2023, he was admitted to the intensive care unit of the private Hygiea hospital in Athens in critical condition after suffering a stroke. He died 4 days later, on 10 January 2023, at the age of 82. His death was leaked by Associated Press, but was then announced by his private office. Constantine never formally renounced his title as King of the Hellenes due to Greek Orthodox anointment tradition, which states that a monarch will never lose their status until their death.

By the decision of the Greek government, in spite of the wishes of the family, the former monarch was not given a state funeral, but was buried as a private citizen. The funeral took place on 16 January in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens in the presence of Archbishop Ieronymos II and a congregation of 200, including ten current and former European monarchs – Philippe of Belgium, Simeon II of Bulgaria, Margrethe II of Denmark, Henri of Luxembourg, Albert II of Monaco, Beatrix and Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, Juan Carlos I and Felipe VI of Spain, and Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden – and members of the royal houses of Baden, Hanover, Iran, Jordan, Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Russia, Schleswig-Holstein, Serbia, and the United Kingdom. The Greek government was represented by Minister of Culture Lina Mendoni and Deputy Prime Minister Panagiotis Pikrammenos. Constantine was buried in Tatoi next to his parents that same day.

==Titles, styles and honours==
===Titles and styles===
Until 1994, Constantine&#x27;s official Greek passport identified him as &quot;Constantine, Former King of the Hellenes&quot;. A law passed in 1994 stripped him of his Greek citizenship, passport and property. The law stated that Constantine could not be granted a Greek passport unless he adopted a surname. Constantine stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a surname — my family doesn&#x27;t have a surname. The law that Mr Papandreou passed basically says that he considers that I am not Greek and that my family was Greek only so long as we were exercising the responsibilities of sovereign, and I had to go out and acquire a surname. The problem is that my family originates from Denmark, and the Danish royal family haven&#x27;t got a surname.&quot; Glücksburg, he said, was not a family surname but the name of a town. He said, &quot;I might as well call myself Mr. Kensington.&quot;

Constantine freely travelled in and out of Greece on a Danish passport, as &quot;Constantino de Grecia&quot; (Spanish for &#x27;Constantine of Greece&#x27;), because Denmark (upon request) issues diplomatic passports to any descendants of King Christian IX and Queen Louise, and Constantine was a Prince of Denmark in his own right. During his first visit to Greece using this passport, Constantine was mocked by some of the Greek media, which hellenised the &quot;de Grecia&quot; designation and used it as a surname, thus naming him .

The International Olympic Committee continued to refer to Constantine as &quot;His Majesty&quot; King Constantine. In Greece, he was referred to as or (&#x27;the former king&#x27;). His official website lists his &quot;correct form of address&quot; as &quot;King Constantine, former King of the Hellenes&quot;.

<doc id="160201" wikidata="Q155394" url="?curid=160201" title="Paul of Greece">
<text>Paul (; 14 December 1901 – 6 March 1964) was King of Greece from 1 April 1947 until his death on 6 March 1964.

Paul was born in Athens as the third son of Crown Prince Constantine and Crown Princess Sophia of Greece. In 1912, the year before his father ascended the throne, Paul joined the Royal Hellenic Navy at eleven years old, becoming the youngest cadet at the time. After the National Schism during World War I, Constantine&#x27;s abdication was forced and Paul and his family went into exile in Switzerland. Paul&#x27;s brother, Alexander, became the Greek sovereign in 1917 when Constantine and Paul were exiled, however, Alexander&#x27;s death in 1920 led to Constantine&#x27;s restoration. In 1922, Paul&#x27;s other brother, George, became the monarch. However, a referendum in 1924 two years later saw the abolition of the Greek monarchy. Paul moved to Italy with his family and then to London.

In London, Paul had an affair with his first cousin and his first love, Princess Nina Georgievna of Russia, who would eventually reject his marriage proposal. The monarchy and George&#x27;s position as king were restored after another referendum in 1935. George was childless, which made Paul the heir presumptive and gave him the responsibility of finding a spouse and having children. At the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, Paul successfully proposed to Frederica of Hanover, who he had been seeing regularly for the past year. However, Paul&#x27;s engagement to a German princess received a mixed reaction in Greece, especially since Adolf Hitler attempted to include Nazi swastika flags at their wedding ceremony. Paul was forced out of Greece with his family during World War II when Greece fell to the Axis Powers. Paul moved to Egypt and then South Africa, where he left his wife and three young children and moved to London with his brother for the remainder of the war.

After World War II&#x27;s conclusion, George returned per another referendum and the Greek Civil War broke out. When George died in 1947, Paul succeeded his brother and became the King of Greece. Paul soon contracted typhoid fever, which restricted his ability to manage the Greek Civil War. The war nonetheless concluded in 1949 with monarchists defeating communist forces in the country. During his reign, Paul was also increasingly faced with deterioration in Greco-British relations and Greco-Turkish relations as he worked to achieve enosis. For his support of the movement, Paul was labelled a terrorist in the British media. Though Paul successfully secured money from the Marshall Plan to fund recovery and infrastructure projects, he was criticised for limiting democracy when the new 1952 Greek constitution gave extensive powers to the monarch. During his reign, Paul was commended by the media for his numerous state visits to multiple countries. He was later diagnosed with stomach cancer and died in 1964. He was succeeded by his only son, who became Constantine II. Paul had three children: Queen Sofía of Spain, Constantine II of Greece, and Princess Irene. Paul was also a first cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

==Early life==

Paul was born on 14 December Old Style: 1 December] 1901 at the Tatoi Palace in Attica north of Athens, the third son of Crown Prince Constantine and his wife, Princess Sophia of Prussia. To his family, he was known as Palo.

Paul grew up in the Presidential Mansion, where his parents resided, and Tatoi Palace, the official residency of the Greek monarch. Paul grew up with five other siblings. When Paul was three years old, his brother, Alexander, almost killed him by accidentally throwing him off a cart that was going full speed into the royal gardens. Paul grew up speaking English to his parents and learned Greek as a second language.

Paul was born as fourth in line to the Greek throne, behind his father and two older brothers. As a result, Paul did not receive a sophisticated education. He was privately tutored by foreign teachers, Greek university professors, who were chosen by Constantine, and Dr Hoenig, his mother&#x27;s Pomeranian chaplain. From 1911 to 1914, Paul travelled to the UK to attend summer courses in Eastbourne at Saint Peter&#x27;s Preparatory School for Young Gentlemen. Paul was said to stand out in more physical subjects, such as woodwork, and in discipline.

In 1909, when Paul was seven years old, a group of Greek officers mounted a coup d&#x27;état against his grandfather, George I of Greece. The officers, led by Nikolaos Zorbas, declared themselves in support of the monarchy, however, asked George I to dismiss his sons from the army. His sons instead resigned from the army. As a result of criticism, Constantine decided to move with his wife and his sons, including Paul, to Germany for several months. The family stayed with Princess Margaret of Prussia, who was Paul&#x27;s maternal aunt, in Kronberg. The family returned to Greece at the beginning of 1911, when the new Greek Priminister, Eleftherios Venizelos, allowed the princes to regain the ranks in the military. The following year, in 1912, and until 1913, Greece fought in the Balkan Wars. Greece was able to double its size in territory in the wars, during which Paul served as the youngest cadet in the Hellenic navy, at eleven years old.

==World War I and aftermath==

===National Schism===
Paul&#x27;s father, Constantine, ascended to the throne upon the assassination of George I in 1913. Constantine wished to keep Greece neutral during the prelude to World War I, but was in support of the Central Powers, since he was the brother-in-law of the German Kaiser, Wilhelm II. Venizelos, however, was staunchly in support of joining the Allies due to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s mistreatment of its Greek population. The disagreement between Constantine and Venizelos quickly resulted in the National Schism, a civil war between the two opposing sides. Per Van der Kiste, possibly due to &quot;being afraid&quot; of Wilhelm II, Constantine continued to refuse to succumb to Venizelos&#x27; demands. Constantine was also pressured to oppose Venizelos by Ioannis Metaxas. On 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, who acted as the Allies&#x27; representative in Greece, ordered Constantine to abdicate. The Allies threatened to invade Greece from a military landing at Piraeus, so Constantine unofficially abdicated. The Allies did not wish to replace Greece with a republican system, so Venizelos scrambled to find a replacement king. It was finally decided that Paul&#x27;s older brother, Alexander, though not the eldest son of Constantine, would succeed to the throne, as Constantine&#x27;s eldest son, George, was also seen as pro-German. Following Jonnart&#x27;s demands for abdication, Paul and his family, except for Alexander, had evacuated Athens.

===Exile to Switzerland===
Paul and his family briefly travelled to Oropos, before going through Italy to live in Switzerland. They first resided in St. Moritz and then in Zürich. The rest of the extended Greek royal family joined them when Venizelos announced Greece&#x27;s entry into World War I. In 1918, Constantine contracted the Spanish flu, causing him to fall severely ill and restricting him from providing for Paul and his other children. The disease almost killed him, however, he managed to recover. Constantine remained concerned about Paul&#x27;s lack of education after the Greek government refused his entry into the British Royal Navy. To Paul&#x27;s dismay, Constantine accepted the offer made by Wilhelm II for Paul to join the Imperial German Navy. Paul soon left Switzerland for Germany and became a cadet.

Paul continued to join the German Imperial Naval Academy, where his training was supervised by his uncle, Prince Henry of Prussia. However, when the German Revolution arose, many naval officers and their crews began mutinies, such as the Kiel mutiny, while the German monarchies began being overthrown, forcing Paul to evacuate back to Switzerland. However, before leaving the country, Paul contracted the Spanish flu, delaying his reunion with his family. It took Paul several days to finally travel back to Switzerland.

After World War I, Greece had made territorial gains in Thrace and Anatolia per the Treaty of Sèvres, to the dismay of the Ottomans, causing the Greco-Turkish War. Despite the war&#x27;s resolution, tension between Constantine and Venizelos still remained high. Paul&#x27;s brother, Alexander, died of sepsis after having been bitten by a monkey, leaving Greece without a monarch and plunging the country into a constitutional crisis. Venizelos sought to find a replacement successor. The Greek parliament refused to reinstate Constantine, and thus Venizelos, on 29 October 1920, sent a letter to the Greek ambassador to Switzerland at the National Hotel in Lucerne, requesting that he meet with Paul, who he saw as the new potential king.

The following day, Paul sent a letter to the ambassador expressing his refusal to disregard the laws of succession to the crown, which is what would occur if Paul were instated as the monarch. Paul wrote that neither his father, Constantine, nor his older brother, George, had ever renounced their rights to the throne and that therefore, his ascension to the throne would be illegitimate. The Greek throne remained vacant while Greece fought in the Greco-Turkish War, during the Turkish War of Independence. During the 1920 Greek legislative election, fighting broke out between a sector of monarchists, who protested for Constantine&#x27;s reascension to the throne, and supporters of Venizelos. On 14 November 1920, the monarchists won and it was organised for Constantine to become King of the Hellenes, while Venizelos was replaced with Dimitrios Rallis. Before Venizelos&#x27; exit from office, he requested that Paul&#x27;s grandmother, Olga Constantinovna of Russia, act as regent before Constantine returned.

===Return to Greece===
On 19 December 1920, Paul and the other Greek royals returned to Greece. They were greeted by demonstrations in support of the monarchy. However, Constantine&#x27;s restoration was criticised by Greece&#x27;s allies in the concurrent Greco-Turkish war, most of which were also Greece&#x27;s allies in World War I, to which Constantine refused to join. Constantine was denied additional support from the Allies in the war against Turkey, allowing Mustafa Kemal to eventually make more territorial gains. Constantine left Paul and his other children with his wife in 1921 when he travelled to Anatolia to boost the morale of Greek troops. While on the frontlines, Constantine attempted to boost confidence by reminding soldiers of their successes in the Balkan Wars. However, after only a few months, Constantine reunited with his children at Tatoi in September 1921.

Upon their return to Greece, Paul wished to resume his naval training and joined the Hellenic Naval Academy, taking up residence in the academy&#x27;s boarding school, located in Piraeus. Paul studied and trained there for two years and was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant in 1922. Paul served for several months on a Greek cruiser, the &quot;Elli&quot;. Despite Greece&#x27;s involvement in the Turkish War of Independence, Paul never fought in a battle but participated in the evacuation of Greek and Armenian refugees from Smyrnan shores following the burning of Smyrna by Turkish troops. Turkey later defeated Greece and their allies, who had been suffering since the fall of Smyrna in August 1922.

==Crown Prince==
===Abdication of father===
Republican propaganda began gaining speed and was being produced by supporters of Venizelos, who was no longer serving in office. On 11 September 1922, a precinct of the army, led by colonels Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylianos Gonatas, conducted a coup d&#x27;état which turned into the 11 September 1922 Revolution, where the second abdication of Constantine was demanded, in addition to the dissolution of the Greek parliament. To avoid unrest and civil war, Constantine abdicated on 27 September, before fleeing to Palermo with his wife and daughters, leaving his two sons, Paul and George, behind. George, the eldest son, succeeded him as George II during political instability caused by the ongoing effects and aftermath of the Greek genocide.

With his brother remaining childless, Paul was officially declared the Crown Prince of Greece. However, the birth of a child between George and his wife, Elisabeth of Romania, would remove Paul from his first-in-line position to the throne. With greater roles as Crown Prince, Paul greater divided his time between serving as a lieutenant in the navy and completing his royal duties in Athens, where he attempted to assist George and Elisabeth in their roles of positively representing the monarchy, which had been facing backlash for almost the past decade. Paul and George&#x27;s father, Constantine, died in exile on 11 January 1923. The government refused to give Constantine a state funeral and Paul was placed in charge of organising his funeral in Italy.

The Greek royal family further suffered damage to its reputation when Paul was involved in a car accident, which resulted in the death of a member of the public. George was forced to pay a large sum of money as compensation for the victim&#x27;s family by using the royal family&#x27;s funds, which had already been greatly depleted because of the Greco-Turkish war.

===Second Hellenic Republic===

In the 1923 Greek legislative election, Venizelos and his party won victory in the Greek parliament and were to assume government at the commencing of the following year. Gonatas, who was serving as prime minister, called for the Greek royal family&#x27;s evacuation of the country while Venizelos and the victorious Liberal Party prepared to assume government. George succumbed to political pressure but refused to abdicate. Tatoi told the press that George and the royal family would be taking an official visit to Romania to visit Elisabeth&#x27;s family, however they were going into exile. George and Elisabeth left the country first, followed by Paul and other members of the royal family on 19 December 1923, residing in Bucharest.

Two months after Venizelos&#x27; government was proclaimed, the Kingdom of Greece was replaced by the Second Hellenic Republic on 25 March 1924, Greece&#x27;s national independence day. Two and a half weeks later, the democratically conducted 1924 Greek republic referendum occurred, confirming the abolition of the monarchy and officially removing George as Greece&#x27;s head of state and Paul as the Crown Prince of Greece. The Greek royal family became stateless, however, Paul was granted a Danish passport from his cousin, Christian X of Denmark.

In Bucharest, where the royal family remained, Paul was welcomed by his sister, Princess Helen, who was unhappily married to the future Carol II of Romania. Not too long after arriving in Romania, Paul departed to stay with his mother and sisters, Princess Irene and Princess Katherine, at the Viva Bobolina in Fiesole. Whilst there, Paul took piano lessons with a retired Italian concert artist.

After living in Tuscany, Paul drove his Lancia Lambda to London, where he wished to become employed. His royal connections to London allowed him to obtain a job in the aeronautics industry, which he wished to join. According to historian Stelios Hourmouzios, Henry Drummond Wolff, and according to historian Ricardo Mateos Sáinz de Medrano, Alphonse d&#x27;Orléans, helped Paul become hired as an apprentice mechanic for Armstrong Siddeley. Paul took on the name Paul Beck, which referred to his family&#x27;s descent from the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, and used that name when renting a room in a house in Clarendon Square, Leamington. Paul travelled to Coventry daily, where he worked in assembling aircraft engines. Paul used his salary to help financially aid his mother in Italy.

After working for Armstrong Siddeley for ten months, Paul departed Coventry and arrived in London, moving into a flat near Victoria Station. Paul joined the Royal Air Force Club of Piccadilly and the Artists&#x27; Rifles Association Club of Raven Street. Concurrently, he attended hunts and regattas organised by the aristocracy, whilst continuing to learn the piano with his friend, Lieutenant-Colonel F. Alan Parker. Paul would frequently visit his friend, who worked as a doctor at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital. After attending and overlooking several surgeries, Paul discovered that he was interested in the operations of hospitals and other medical centres.
Paul&#x27;s family discovered an affair between him and Princess Nina Georgievna of Russia, but he claimed that he had fallen in love. Nina was the elder daughter of Paul&#x27;s aunt, Maria, and Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia, making her Paul&#x27;s first cousin. However, Nina rejected his later marriage proposal, choosing instead to marry Prince Paul Aleksandrovich Chavchavadze in 1922. Thereupon, Paul became reportedly demotivated in finding a spouse due to his mother&#x27;s disapproval of his marrying a commoner, insisting that he marry someone of blue blood. This was because Paul&#x27;s brother, Alexander, had married a commoner Aspasia Manos and the birth of their child took years to be legitimized. Paul&#x27;s mother soon landed in England and convinced Paul that he was reducing the family&#x27;s chances of being restored. Paul became pressured as the responsibility of continuing the family&#x27;s lineage increased due to George and Elisabeth&#x27;s sterility. However, Paul held off from finding himself a relationship.

In Spring 1930 Paul met Captain Frederick Wessel, a wealthy annuitant of Danish origin. Wessel invited him on his planned cruise through the Aegean Sea on his personal yacht. Although Paul was eager to travel through his old homeland, he was still banned from entering Greek waters, so he and Wessel agreed to hide his identity and refrain from any political activity while on their trip. On 10 July 1930, Paul boarded Wessel&#x27;s bat, the &quot;Frefrada&quot;, from Villefranche-sur-Mer. The yacht travelled along the French and Italian coastline for three weeks, before landing in Corfu on 2 August 1930. Paul and the rest of the group traveled around the Greek islands for the next month and a half, arriving through the Gulf of Patras on 5 August, Corinth on 7 August, the port of Phalerum in Athens in Vouliagmeni on 19 August, through Chalki, Euboea, Skiathos and Skyros by 25 August, Kymi on 26 August, through Andros, Syros, Santorini and Crete by 29 August, and then finally in Navarino and Argostoli by 12 September. Following this final stop, the yacht returned to Italy.

While illegally travelling through Greece, Paul visited his former residences, Mon Repos, the former royal palace in Athens, and Tatoi. While at Tatoi, an old servant recognized him and allowed him to come inside to see the palace&#x27;s rooms. To the disapproval of Wessel, Paul was able to talk to members of the media about the restoration of the monarchy and learned that many Greeks were now opposing the republic due to its instability. However, Paul managed to keep his identity hidden and only few people he spoke to recognized him.

The following year, Paul&#x27;s mother was diagnosed with cancer. He went to Italy to help her but was unaware that she had been moved to Germany. Paul went to Germany and his mother, whose condition had worsened, died in Frankfurt on 13 January 1932 while with her children. Paul soon became closer to his three sisters and established a home with Helen, who had bought the Bobolina villa after divorcing Carol II of Romania.

===Restoration of the monarchy===
The Second Hellenic Republic had tired most Greeks out, with, in only eleven years, 23 governments, 13 coup d&#x27;états and one dictatorship. Each government lasted on average six months, while a coup was either attempted or organized every 42 weeks. The majority of Greeks were now opposed to the republic, and many called for the return of the monarchy. However, monarchists were divided over who should take up the Greek throne. Most supported George&#x27;s restoration, however, there were large minorities that wished for the king to be a different person, such as Prince George, Duke of Kent. The Greek army finally deposed Prime Minister Panagis Tsaldaris and President Alexandros Zaimis on 10 October 1935, and replaced them with the Minister of War, Georgios Kondylis, who had been a supporter of Venizelos during the National Schism. Despite this, Kondylis disapproved of the republic and publicly claimed while in office that it had brought anarchy to the country. Kondylis&#x27; government proclaimed that the Kingdom of Greece had been restored, and he became the regent of Greece while George travelled from England to take back the crown. Before doing so, George, supported by Paul and other members of the family, ordered that a referendum be hosted to confirm his return.

The 1935 Greek monarchy referendum was held, which affirmed that 97.87% of Greeks were in support of the return of the king. Foreign observers at the time claimed that the vote was rigged and noted concerns that voters who were opposed to the monarchy would face beatings. Once the figure of the supposed overwhelming support for the monarchy was announced, a Greek ambassador met with George and Paul at the Greek embassy in London and officially requested that they return to Tatoi. On 5 November 1935, they accepted and began their journeys back to Greece on 14 November. Before returning to Greece, they stopped in Paris and met President Albert Lebrun and their uncle, Prince Andrew. Paul and George then stopped in Italy to collect their sisters, who had been living in the Villa Sparta, and other members of the Greek royal family, such as Prince Christopher. Paul and his family briefly went to Florence to pay homage to their parents, who had been buried temporarily beside the Church of the Nativity of Christ and St. Nicholas, a Russian Orthodox Church. In Rome, Victor Emmanuel III gifted the Greek royals the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation. The &quot;Elli&quot; took the family from Brindisi back to Athens, where they arrived on 25 November and were welcomed by a large applauding crowd.

Paul became overwhelmed with his royal duties upon George&#x27;s almost immediate neglect of his role within Greece. Historian John Van der Kiste describes George as having become a &quot;suspicious and taciturn man&quot; who had little interest in showing affinity and becoming close with his younger brother, Paul. Both living at Tatoi, their interactions became awkward and their relationship distanced, while both had little affection for one another. Paul frequently acted as the unofficial regent for Greece and often represented George at events, such as at the repatriation of their parents&#x27; bodies to the Tatoi burial grounds and at Venizelos&#x27; funeral in 1936. Additionally, Paul resumed his duties within the navy, further overworking him. His royal duties restricted him from working out at sea, however, he worked to develop and modernise the Scouts of Greece, which he became the president of during the 1920s.

On 4 August 1936, while George continued to neglect his role, General Metaxas overthrew the democratically elected government with a dictatorship. Paul distanced himself from both George and Metaxas after the Scouts of Greece was forced to be integrated into the National Youth Organisation, a fascist movement supported by Metaxas. Paul received the wrath of Metaxas on multiple occasions when he refused to perform the fascist salute at official events and ceremonies.
Despite his growing distance from his brother, Paul was bearing the responsibility of providing an heir to the Greek throne. Greece followed Semi-Salic law, meaning that if Paul were not to have a child, the throne would pass after him to an uncle, such as Prince George, Prince Nicholas, Prince Andrew or Prince Christopher, however, all of which had accumulated bad reputations in Greece. The next option was for the throne to pass to one of Paul&#x27;s cousins, such as Prince Peter or Prince Philip, however, both had become unaffiliated from Greece during their exiles and would later renounce their rights to the throne. Paul attempted to use his interests in tennis and archeology to appeal to younger girls.

Earlier in 1927 while visiting his mother in Austria, Paul had met Frederica of Hanover at the Hubertihaus estate. Frederica was only ten years old at the time and called Paul, who was sixteen years older, &quot;my uncle&quot;, as Paul was a first cousin of Frederica&#x27;s mother, Princess Victoria Louise. In 1934, Paul and Frederica met again in London at the wedding of Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark and Prince George, Duke of Kent. The next year, Frederica met Paul in Florence while studying at the American College. Frederica stayed with Paul&#x27;s sisters during this time. The pair met several times at the Villa Sparta and were said to have fallen in love. Paul&#x27;s sisters were highly supportive of the relationship and attempted to encourage it, before Paul wrote to Frederica&#x27;s parents, Victoria Louise and Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, and asked for their consent to marry her. However, Ernest Augustus declined because of Frederica&#x27;s young age. Mateos Sáinz de Medrano describes Paul as having been &quot;highly disappointed&quot; at Ernest Augustus&#x27; response, but he did not give up on finding a spouse. Although it is reported that Paul was looking for a Greek commoner to marry, he searched and found Frederica during his trip to Germany for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. He went to the Königinvilla in Gmunden and asked Frederica&#x27;s parents again if he could marry her, to which they finally agreed. Paul and Frederica&#x27;s engagement was soon announced to the public.
When Paul returned to Greece, his engagement was met with mixed reception. Many Greeks had turned against the royal family when George consented to the Metaxas dictatorship due to his lack of interest in his role. Many citizens were also worried of the cost of the Crown Prince&#x27;s wedding due to the effects of the Great Depression, and protests against taxpayer money being spent of glamorous royal events were held across the country. Paul lacked a personal residence and therefore relied on public expenditure to fund his wedding. Furthermore, the choice of a German bride concerned many Greeks as they feared that the dynasty would become less Greek, reinforced by the family&#x27;s Danish and German roots. The public was also scared of the backlash from the former Allies of World War I, especially since Constantine I&#x27;s marriage to a German princess had caused the National Schism within the country. Metaxas, however, approved of Paul’s marriage to Frederica because he hoped that it would strengthen ties between Greece and the fascist Nazi regime in Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, who wanted to use the marriage to spread influence in Greece. Hitler also planned to include Nazi symbols, flags, and anthems at the couple&#x27;s 1938 wedding. George wished to distance Greece from the dynasty&#x27;s German origins and was thus opposed to their marriage. Frederica, being Hanoverian, was a close relative of the British family and had to ask permission from George VI to marry Paul, a Greek Orthodox prince.

Frederica had not arrived yet in Greece when the Church of Greece asked her to adopt a Greek name as there was no Orthodox Saint yet that had ever had her first name. The Church explained that by choosing a Greek name, she would be able to identify with Greece&#x27;s culture and religion, and would provide her with more popularity. However, Frederica refused this request by the Holy Synod by claiming that her name was an integral part of her identity. Frederica&#x27;s insistence continued and the Church was forced to reluctantly abandon their request. The Greek public however was arguably more shocked at the fact that swastikas, a symbol used by the Nazi Party, were present at Paul and Frederica&#x27;s wedding ceremony. To block Nazi flags, Paul and George planned to raise Greek flags and also the former Hanoverian kingdom&#x27;s flags throughout the streets of Athens. However, the former official regional flags were banned in Germany and thus Frederica opposed this because she was worried about displeasing Hitler, who she feared would threaten her parents, who resided in Germany.

In early January 1938, Frederica and her parents arrived in Greece through the country&#x27;s border with Yugoslavia, where Paul and Metaxas personally greeted them. On 9 January 1938, their wedding was conducted alongside multiple balls, banquets, and concerts throughout the country. Many Greek citizens were opposed to the wedding&#x27;s high costs resulting from the accommodation and transport of high-profile guests and wedding participants, most of whom stayed at the Hotel Grande Bretagne while waiting for the wedding. At the wedding, there was an overwhelming number of German princes, princesses and representatives, which the Greek public saw as discomforting. At the wedding, Paul wore the outfit of an admiral in the Greek navy and his witnesses were his nephew, the Crown Prince of Romania, and his cousin, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich of Russia, along with his three brothers-in-law, the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, Prince George William and Prince Christian Oscar.

The Greek government’s wedding present to Paul was the Psychiko Palace, a villa in Psychiko, a district of Athens. The palace was built by a wealthy Greek magnate and was made up of two floors, a small garden, and a balcony that faced the streets. It was redecorated by his sister, Irene, before Paul and Frederica moved in. The government gave Frederica a small farm in Polydendri forest, near the town of Larissa in Thessaly. Frederica soon became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter on 2 November 1938 at Psychiko Palace. Paul and Frederica wish to name their daughter, the future Queen Sofía of Spain, Olga, but Greek naming tradition required them to name the child Sophia after Paul&#x27;s mother. On 2 June 1940, Frederica gave birth to an heir, the future Constantine II.

===World War II===

While Frederica was pregnant and giving birth to her three children, the last of which was Princess Irene, Nazi troops were gradually invading different countries throughout Europe, including France, which collapsed under the Nazi tactic of &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;. On 10 July 1940, Fascist Italy entered the war on the side of the Axis. Benito Mussolini launched a violent propaganda campaign against Greece and accused George of violating its neutrality by harbouring British ships within its waters. On 15 August 1940, an Italian submarine sunk the &quot;Elli&quot;, which was escorting pilgrims from Tinos. Germany offered mediation between Greece and Italy. It was agreed that if George were to abdicate and Paul become the monarch, Germany would prevent an Italian invasion of Greece. The deal also guaranteed Greek territorial gains in the Balkans. George was furious and made the Nazis write in response to Greece&#x27;s actions: &quot;They would do better not to stick their noses in the affairs of [his] country in they know what is good for them!&quot; Germany continued attempting to put Paul on the throne.

On 28 October 1940, Mussolini sent Metaxas an ultimatum and demanded that he accepted within three hours while placing Italian troops in Italian-occupied Albania and in Greek Epirus. Metaxas refused and the Greco-Italian war commenced. Both the opposition, led by Plastiras, and the current government, pledged their support for George, who took charge of the Greek armed forces. Greece automatically joined the Allies and remained in close contact with their leaders. George held daily war council meetings at the Hotel Grande Bretagne, while Paul hosted communication links from each war front and continued his role in the navy from Athens. Greece successfully repelled Mussolini&#x27;s invasion and occupied southern Albania.

Metaxas died on 29 January 1941. George refused to establish a national unity government and appointed the Governor of the National Bank of Greece, Alexandros Koryzis, as the new prime minister. This gave George an even worse reputation as his decision to inaugurate Koryzis continued the dictatorship established by Metaxas in 1936. George faced criticism not only in Greece but also by the Allies. After several victories in Albania, Greek forces capitulated in the German invasion of Greece, which proceeded the German invasion of Yugoslavia. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27; launched Operation Retribution, which saw the German army invading Yugoslavia after their refusal to join the Axis. The German annexation of Yugoslavia put Axis troops on the Greek border. Greek soldiers, accompanied by a regiment sent by London, were overwhelmed in Macedonia and Thessaloniki was captured on 9 April. The Metaxas Line was also crossed by Axis soldiers the same day. By mid-April, Koryzis asked George to accept capitulation, but George refused to compromise with enemy forces. On 18 April, Koryzis committed suicide, and Emmanouil Tsouderos took office three days after.

Fearful of their impending arrests, Paul, George, other members of the royal family, and some government officials agreed to flee the mainland and land in Crete on 9 April. The island however was very underfortified and under heavy attacks from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. George asked the British government if they could stay in British Cyprus, alongside the cabinet and some 50,000 Greek soldiers. By 22 April, almost everyone but Paul and George had left Athens. George and Paul set up a temporary headquarters in Chania with their cousin, Prince Peter. George was given the title of &quot;Number 1 enemy of the Reich in Greece&quot; by Hitler and all three royals were forced to evacuate the island when the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; commenced an attack. Paul, George and Peter narrowly escaped the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; by taking the British ship from Sfakia to Alexandria, where the rest of the royal family had fled to.

In Alexandria, the Greek diaspora of Egypt welcomed Paul, George and members of the royal family with accommodation, clothing and money. The Axis government established in occupied Greece worried Farouk of Egypt, who had many pro-Italian ministers. Paul and the rest of the Greek royals were forced to find refuge in another nation. George VI denied them access to the United Kingdom as he opposed Frederica&#x27;s entry into the country, worried that a descendant of Wilhelm II would cause a revolt against the British monarchy, which had German roots. After mediations, it was decided that Paul and George would stay in London, with other members of the family moving to South Africa, a British colony. Paul placed his wife and two young children in Cape Town and under the protection of Prime Minister Jan Smuts, before leaving for London. While there, Paul was unable to return for the birth of his third child, Irene, on 11 May 1942.

Per Hourmouzios, Paul felt sidelined from business and combat with his brother taking over any real duties left. Following many requests, Paul managed to gain authority to go to Cairo and join the Free Greek Forces in August 1942, wishing to help liberate Greece. However, there was growing republicanism in the Greek forces and thus George prohibited Paul from fighting in Greece. Frederica moved to Cairo to be with Paul in January 1944, while their children stayed in South Africa with Smuts until March. There, the royal couple connected with the Egyptian royal family, particularly Farida of Egypt and her children, who were of similar age to Paul.

Greece was slowly liberated through 1944 and most Greek exiles had the opportunity to return home, however, Paul and his family were forced to stay in Egypt due to the rise of republican opposition in Greece following the war. Under the guidance of Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden, George appointed Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens as regent of the country on 29 December 1944. However, Archbishop Damaskinos almost instantaneously formed government with a republican majority and placed Plastiras as Head of the Cabinet. George considered abdicating in favour of Paul, however ultimately remained as the monarch. Paul believed that if he were able to return to Greece, he could have acted as the regent and prevented a republican government. However, George ignored any calls from Paul. The 1946 Greek referendum was held and monarchists received 68.41% of the votes, which allowed members of the Greek royal family, including Paul and George, to return. Archbishop Damaskinos greeted them upon their return, after which the royals discovered that their palaces had been pillaged and ransacked, while the Greek Civil War between the monarchists and communists began to take place.

==Reign==
===Accession===

Paul succeeded to the throne on 1 April 1947 upon the death of his childless elder brother, George II, during the Greek Civil War. Paul and his family left their villa in Psychiko and moved to Tatoi after major work had been done to restore the palace. The family continuously moved between Tatoi and Psychiko due to building disruptions until 1949 when they moved in permanently. Paul and Frederica spoke English to each other and to their children despite being fluent in the Greek language. Paul frequently read, told stories and listened to classical music in the presence of his daughters, who later attended a boarding school in Salem to complete their education. The two girls were influenced by the teachings of Kurt Hahn, a Judo-German teacher whose ideas were commonly found as principles in royal families of German origin. Meanwhile, the new Crown Prince, Constantine, was sent by Paul and Frederica to the Anavryta Experimental Lyceum in Marousi.

Starting in 1947, Paul and Frederica took their children to Falken, Austria, for a skiing holiday every winter, and to Petalis in the summer, where the family was lent yachts. On these holidays, Frederica&#x27;s German relatives were frequently invited, such as princes and princesses of the royal houses of Baden, Hesse, Hanover and Hohenlohe. In 1947, Paul was unable to attend the wedding of Prince Philip to the future Elizabeth II as he was suffering from typhoid fever. In addition to their German relatives, members of the Romanov dynasty who had not been murdered after the Russian Revolution were often welcomed at Tatoi. In June 1948, the wedding of Michael I of Romania and Anne of Bourbon-Parma was held in Athens.

During Paul&#x27;s early reign, there was tension between certain members of the Greek royal family. Paul and his cousin, Peter, maintained a strained relationship after the royal family accused him of entering a misalliance by marrying Irina Ovtchinnikova, a divorced Russian commoner. Paul&#x27;s aunt, Princess Alice of Battenberg, who was the mother of Prince Philip, regularly engaged in disagreements with Frederica, who she thought was clumsy and scared of her sister-in-law, Elena Vladimirovna of Russia.

===Greek Civil War and Cyprus problem===

Paul&#x27;s contraction of typhoid fever immobilised him for several weeks and caused fears for his health, concurrent to the ongoing Greek Civil War, in which guerrilla warfare conducted by communists continued in the north of the country. Communists in Macedonia attempted to proclaim a people&#x27;s republic. On Christmas Day 1947, communist militias initiated an attack on Konitsa, and Paul wished to walk through the frontlines but was unable to due to his health. Instead, Frederica held numerous talks between her and the fighting soldiers. At a point in time, Frederica herself travelled to the Epirus frontline, which, according to Hourmouzios, boosted her popularity and branded her a &quot;strong and courageous woman&quot;.

On 15 October 1949, the communist forces retreated, which caused large celebrations within the army, also due to higher tensions in Soviet Union–Yugoslavia relations, which slowed support for the Greek communists. By the end of the civil war, around 158,000 people had been killed and approximately 100,000 to 200,000 civil war refugees were deported by Eastern Bloc nations. Thousands of Churches, schools, factories, and homes were destroyed or incapable of functioning. In response to these damages, Paul and Frederica created the Her Majesty&#x27;s Fund foundation in 1947 to give financial aid to victims of the civil war.

In June 1952, Paul and Frederica made an official state visit to Turkey to ease Greco-Turkish relations. The Turkish government invited the couple to the Hagia Sophia, a Greek Orthodox Church that had been converted into a mosque and then to a museum, but they declined, instead only visiting the tomb of Mustafa Kemal. The state visit marked the first time a Greek head of state had made a state visit to Turkey, which had occupied Greece for over 400 years. This improved relations between the two nations. Paul also worked to facilitate Greco-Yugoslav relations by making a state visit to Belgrade in September 1955. The following year, Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito and First Lady Jovanka Broz privately met Paul and Frederica in Corfu. Paul and Frederica also made state visits to the United Kingdom in 1952 and 1963, to the United States in 1953, to France and West Germany in 1956, to Switzerland in 1958, to Ethiopia and Italy in 1959, and to India and Thailand in 1963.

During his visit to the United Kingdom in 1952, Paul walked behind the coffin of George VI during his state funeral procession. Alongside Paul were members of the British royal family, Haakon VII of Norway, Frederik IX of Denmark, Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden and President Vincent Auriol of France. Paul and Frederica also made trips to different regions of Greece. Every year on 21 February, the liberation day of Ioannina, on 26 October, the liberation day of Thessaloniki, and on 30 November, the liberation day of Patras and Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, Paul and Frederica would celebrate these regional festivities. Paul also habitually ensured that Greece&#x27;s borders with its neighbours were secured. Paul also travelled to the destruction sites of natural disasters, such as the 1953 Ionian earthquake, 1955 Volos earthquake and 1956 Amorgos earthquake.

In order to promote the then barely developed tourism on the Greek islands, Paul and Frederica invited all ruling and former ruling European royal families to a cruise between the islands in 1954, for which the shipowner Pétros Nomikós made his passenger ship &quot;Agamemnon&quot; available. Over 100 guests took part in this 14-day voyage, which became known as the &quot;Cruise of the Kings&quot; and was repeated in 1956 on the ship &quot;Achilles&quot; between Athens and Corfu. Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria, and his family took part in these trips, which is why he decided to return to Paul the Greek crown jewels of the Wittelsbach king Otto of Greece, who had been deposed in 1862. Albrecht&#x27;s son Prince Max presented these to Paul in December 1959. It had been almost a century since they were last in Greece.
Earlier in 1948, the government of the United Kingdom announced its intentions to constitutionally reform their colony in Cyprus, an island inhabited by Greeks. Despite Greek visits to the United Kingdom, links with Britain became strained over Cyprus, where the majority Greek population favored union with Greece, which Britain, as the colonial power, would not endorse. The idea of a union between Greece and Cyprus became known as enosis. Archbishop Makarios III called for Cypriots to reject Britain&#x27;s reforms and protest in favour of enosis. Paul released a public statement via &quot;The New York Times&quot; in which he declared his support for enosis. The Greek government had not been informed of Paul&#x27;s plans to release his opinion and was initially stunted, but accepted the public&#x27;s approval of Paul&#x27;s support. Cyprus had been an issue of contention since the conclusion of the Greek Civil War and at George VI&#x27;s funeral, Paul unsuccessfully attempted to host talks with the British government to achieve enosis. Paul additionally tried to prove to the British that Cyprus&#x27; fate should be determined by the native Cypriot inhabitants. During his visit to Turkey, Paul also initiated talks regarding enosis, which would affect the Turkish Cypriot minority on the island.

Greco-British relations were further strained when Archbishop Makarios III was greeted in Athens in 1953 and again in 1954. This led the British government to declare that enosis was &quot;unthinkable&quot; and drafted a new constitution for Cyprus. Greek Prime Minister Alexandros Papagos submitted a document outlining the issues of the Cyprus problem to the United Nations, while EOKA and General Georgios Grivas led an independence movement. The British government invited Greek and Turkish delegates to London for mediation talks on 29 August 1955. The talks only resulted in stiff relations between Greece, Turkey, and Britain. Paul and Greece&#x27;s reputation in Turkey was then damaged by the Istanbul pogrom.

After the British government arrested Archbishop Makarios III and deported him to the Seychelles, anti-British sentiment in Greece grew as displayed through protests in some of Greece&#x27;s largest cities. The Greek ambassador to London was subsequently dismissed from office. Paul made known his frustration with the situation and made speeches to the United Nations, calling for enosis. Archbishop Makarios III was released on 28 March 1957 as a result of pressure from American President Dwight D. Eisenhower, while there were numerous accounts of terrorism in Cyprus. The Turkish government then proposed &quot;Taksim&quot;, which would divide Cyprus between Greece and Turkey, however, both Greece and Paul opposed this idea. As violence between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots grew, the United Kingdom suggested that Cyprus become a shared Anglo-Greco-Turkish condominium, but Archbishop Makarios III and Paul rejected this as it went against the wishes of the Greek and Greek Cypriot population. On 10 September 1958, Paul made another speech, while in Switzerland, again declaring his support for enosis. In the United Kingdom, the press accused Paul of supporting the terrorism conducted by Greek Cypriot nationalists. On 5 February 1959, the London and Zürich Agreements established the resumption of real negotiations between Greece and Turkey, to the delight of Paul. Eventually, Cyprus became an independent state in 1960.

===Economic miracle and growing authoritarianism===
Greece was one of the first nations to benefit from the Marshall Plan and took advantage of American economic aid. Between 1948 and 1952, Greece received over US$376 million in financial aid from the United States. Economic growth was also due to growing political stability within Greece, something that Paul was greatly credited for. In eleven years, Greece was governed by only two prime ministers, Papagos and Konstantinos Karamanlis, a record for the past few decades. Alongside &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;, agriculture, industry, mining and tourism boomed. The Greek drachma stabilised, while many Greeks moved into West Germany to send back large parts of their incomes. Economists, however, continued to worry about the fact that Greece&#x27;s economy was very reliant on foreign loans and a majority of food consumed needed to be imported into the country. In addition, one-third of the national budget was spent on the military and defence.

Although written out as a constitutional monarchy, critics of Greece&#x27;s politics claimed that the country contained traits of an authoritarian monarchy. The Greek constitution of 1952 granted extensive powers to the king, more than that of other European monarchs. Throughout Europe, Paul was subject to accusations of limiting democracy by the media, though both Van der Kriste and Hourmouzios state that many of these reports were exaggerated. The media used Paul&#x27;s quick political stance to the Cyprus problem, his travel to Britain in 1963 despite the prime minister&#x27;s recommendation and his close links with higher ranking staff in the Greek army as examples of these accusations. The cost of the monarchy was also questioned, and Paul and Frederica were accused of spending public funds for their own personal holidays and expensive lifestyle while having a lack of worry for the Greek public. The couple were also accused of taking money from Her Majesty&#x27;s Fund for their personal use. One of the greatest critics of the monarchy was the leader of the opposition, Georgios Papandreou. Papandreou made the words in one of his speeches – &quot;The king reigns, but does not govern&quot; – his motto and boycotted several royal events.

===Later reign===
On 2 June 1958, Crown Prince Constantine turned 18 and thus commenced his royal duties. Constantine often shadowed Paul, who taught him the role of being the monarch. Paul was also very weary of the struggles he and his brother faced and wished to teach Constantine ways of avoiding the types of issues they experienced. Since the age of six, Constantine accompanied Paul in his sailing trips, and in December 1958, Paul and Frederica gifted him with his private sailboat. Constantine trained daily with Odysseus Eskitzoglou and Georgios Zaimis. With the support of Paul, the three enrolled to participate in the 1960 Summer Olympics. On 7 September 1960, they won a gold medal in the sailing event at the Olympics. It was marked with celebrations in Greece, being the second time Greece had won a gold medal in the Modern Olympics, the first being at the 1896 Summer Olympics and won by Spyridon Louis. Paul was also pleased with the wedding of his eldest daughter, Sofía, to Prince Juan Carlos of Spain, who was the heir to the Spanish throne. After having first met on the Cruise of the Kings, Sofía and Juan Carlos reunited at the Rome Olympics, where their relationship and future marriage was pathed.

In early 1963, Frederica was invited to attend the wedding of Princess Alexandra of Kent and Angus Ogilvy. Karamanlis persisted that she did not go to the wedding due to tensions between Athens and London over the Cyprus problem. Karamanlis feared that their attendance at the British royal wedding would create public uproar and opposition. However, Frederica did not listen to his advice and when she arrived in London, English tabloids released photos from the 1930s that showed Frederica and her brothers in the Hitler Youth uniform, describing her as a right-wing extremist with an iron fist. Protests against Frederica were held in the United Kingdom, however few were in Greece. Papandreou and his allies used it as an opportunity to claim that the lack of protests in Greece was because the monarchy had restricted freedom of speech, saying that Greece had committed &quot;crimes&quot;. Communist Betty Ambatielos, whose husband had been imprisoned, organised violent demonstrations in London outside the hotel that Frederica was staying in. Frederica is forced to escape with members of the public who support her. The British government sent a &quot;clumsy apology letter&quot; to Paul, further damaging Greco-British relations.

On 22 May 1963, left-wing minister of parliament Grigoris Lambrakis was hit by a motorcycle in Thessaloniki and was killed. A later investigation discovered that the accident was a political attack and high-ranking government officials, who were closely associated with Paul and the monarchy, had been involved in its organisation. Although Paul&#x27;s reputation was not as badly affected directly, Karamanlis&#x27; party, the National Radical Union, who was the monarchy&#x27;s greatest supporter, was weakened in the public eye. Paul visited London two months later, which resulted in Karamanlis&#x27; resignation and Paul&#x27;s greatest critic, Papandreou, formed government with his party following the 1964 Greek legislative election.

==Death==

For the last ten years of his life, Paul suffered from multiple health issues. He suffered from vision-related issues, so in 1959, he had an operation for a cataract, and in 1963 an emergency operation for appendicitis. However, later in January 1964, Paul was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Signs of his cancer began showing following his weakness after a trip to the United Kingdom. Paul fainted during the inauguration speech of Papandreou, which took place in February. Surgeons soon operated on a stomach ulcer but discovered that the cancer had grown substantially and ruled out any opportunity for recovery. Paul soon became medically restricted to Tatoi, where Frederica took care of him, while Constantine urgently travelled to Tinos to bring a holy icon. On 6 March 1964, at 16:12 (4:12 pm), after another surgery, Paul died at the age of 62.

Paul&#x27;s funeral was held on 11 March 1964 and was attended by his family, as well as Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Umberto II of Italy, Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, American First Lady Bird Johnson, Simeon II of Bulgaria, Rainier III of Monaco and former American President Harry Truman. Paul was buried in the Tatoi gardens, where other deceased members of the Greek royal family are. Paul was succeeded by his son, who became King Constantine II. Paul&#x27;s wife, Frederica, died 17 years later in 1981. In March 2014, a memorial service took place in the grounds of Tatoi Palace in Athens commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Paul&#x27;s death. Members of the Greek and Spanish royal families were present. In September 2020, Paul and Frederica&#x27;s graves were minimally vandalised, but soon restored by the Greek government.

<text>In cryptography, a block cipher mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide information security such as confidentiality or authenticity. A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation (encryption or decryption) of one fixed-length group of bits called a block. A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a cipher&#x27;s single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block.

Most modes require a unique binary sequence, often called an initialization vector (IV), for each encryption operation. The IV must be non-repeating, and for some modes must also be random. The initialization vector is used to ensure that distinct ciphertexts are produced even when the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times independently with the same key. Block ciphers may be capable of operating on more than one block size, but during transformation the block size is always fixed. Block cipher modes operate on whole blocks and require that the final data fragment be padded to a full block if it is smaller than the current block size. There are, however, modes that do not require padding because they effectively use a block cipher as a stream cipher.

Historically, encryption modes have been studied extensively in regard to their error propagation properties under various scenarios of data modification. Later development regarded integrity protection as an entirely separate cryptographic goal. Some modern modes of operation combine confidentiality and authenticity in an efficient way, and are known as authenticated encryption modes.

==History and standardization==
The earliest modes of operation, ECB, CBC, OFB, and CFB (see below for all), date back to 1981 and were specified in FIPS 81, &quot;DES Modes of Operation&quot;. In 2001, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) revised its list of approved modes of operation by including AES as a block cipher and adding CTR mode in SP800-38A, &quot;Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation&quot;. Finally, in January, 2010, NIST added XTS-AES in SP800-38E, &quot;Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The XTS-AES Mode for Confidentiality on Storage Devices&quot;. Other confidentiality modes exist which have not been approved by NIST. For example, CTS is ciphertext stealing mode and available in many popular cryptographic libraries.

The block cipher modes ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, and XTS provide confidentiality, but they do not protect against accidental modification or malicious tampering. Modification or tampering can be detected with a separate message authentication code such as CBC-MAC, or a digital signature. The cryptographic community recognized the need for dedicated integrity assurances and NIST responded with HMAC, CMAC, and GMAC. HMAC was approved in 2002 as FIPS 198, &quot;The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)&quot;, CMAC was released in 2005 under SP800-38B, &quot;Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The CMAC Mode for Authentication&quot;, and GMAC was formalized in 2007 under SP800-38D, &quot;Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC&quot;.

The cryptographic community observed that compositing (combining) a confidentiality mode with an authenticity mode could be difficult and error prone. They therefore began to supply modes which combined confidentiality and data integrity into a single cryptographic primitive (an encryption algorithm). These combined modes are referred to as authenticated encryption, AE or &quot;authenc&quot;. Examples of AE modes are CCM (SP800-38C), GCM (SP800-38D), CWC, EAX, IAPM, and OCB.

Modes of operation are defined by a number of national and internationally recognized standards bodies. Notable standards organizations include NIST, ISO (with ISO/IEC 10116), the IEC, the IEEE, ANSI, and the IETF.

==Initialization vector (IV)==
An initialization vector (IV) or starting variable (SV) is a block of bits that is used by several modes to randomize the encryption and hence to produce distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times, without the need for a slower re-keying process.

An initialization vector has different security requirements than a key, so the IV usually does not need to be secret. For most block cipher modes it is important that an initialization vector is never reused under the same key, i.e. it must be a cryptographic nonce. Many block cipher modes have stronger requirements, such as the IV must be random or pseudorandom. Some block ciphers have particular problems with certain initialization vectors, such as all zero IV generating no encryption (for some keys).

It is recommended to review relevant IV requirements for the particular block cipher mode in relevant specification, for example SP800-38A.

For CBC and CFB, reusing an IV leaks some information about the first block of plaintext, and about any common prefix shared by the two messages.

For OFB and CTR, reusing an IV causes key bitstream re-use, which breaks security. This can be seen because both modes effectively create a bitstream that is XORed with the plaintext, and this bitstream is dependent on the key and IV only.

In CBC mode, the IV must be unpredictable (random or pseudorandom) at encryption time; in particular, the (previously) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext block of a message as the IV for the next message is insecure (for example, this method was used by SSL 2.0). If an attacker knows the IV (or the previous block of ciphertext) before the next plaintext is specified, they can check their guess about plaintext of some block that was encrypted with the same key before (this is known as the TLS CBC IV attack).

For some keys, an all-zero initialization vector may generate some block cipher modes (CFB-8, OFB-8) to get the internal state stuck at all-zero. For CFB-8, an all-zero IV and an all-zero plaintext, causes 1/256 of keys to generate no encryption, plaintext is returned as ciphertext. For OFB-8, using all zero initialization vector will generate no encryption for 1/256 of keys. OFB-8 encryption returns the plaintext unencrypted for affected keys.

Some modes (such as AES-SIV and AES-GCM-SIV) are built to be more nonce-misuse resistant, i.e. resilient to scenarios in which the randomness generation is faulty or under the control of the attacker. 
* Synthetic initialization vectors (SIV) synthesize an internal IV by running a pseudo-random function (PRF) construction called S2V on the input (additional data and plaintext), preventing any external data from directly controlling the IV. External nonces / IV may be fed into S2V as an additional data field.
* AES-GCM-SIVs synthesize an internal IV by running POLYVAL Galois mode of authentication on input (additional data and plaintext), followed by an AES operation.

==Padding==

A block cipher works on units of a fixed size (known as a &quot;block size&quot;), but messages come in a variety of lengths. So some modes (namely ECB and CBC) require that the final block be padded before encryption. Several padding schemes exist. The simplest is to add null bytes to the plaintext to bring its length up to a multiple of the block size, but care must be taken that the original length of the plaintext can be recovered; this is trivial, for example, if the plaintext is a C style string which contains no null bytes except at the end. Slightly more complex is the original DES method, which is to add a single one bit, followed by enough zero bits to fill out the block; if the message ends on a block boundary, a whole padding block will be added. Most sophisticated are CBC-specific schemes such as ciphertext stealing or residual block termination, which do not cause any extra ciphertext, at the expense of some additional complexity. Schneier and Ferguson suggest two possibilities, both simple: append a byte with value 128 (hex 80), followed by as many zero bytes as needed to fill the last block, or pad the last block with &quot;n&quot; bytes all with value &quot;n&quot;.

CFB, OFB and CTR modes do not require any special measures to handle messages whose lengths are not multiples of the block size, since the modes work by XORing the plaintext with the output of the block cipher. The last partial block of plaintext is XORed with the first few bytes of the last keystream block, producing a final ciphertext block that is the same size as the final partial plaintext block. This characteristic of stream ciphers makes them suitable for applications that require the encrypted ciphertext data to be the same size as the original plaintext data, and for applications that transmit data in streaming form where it is inconvenient to add padding bytes.

==Common modes==

=== Authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) modes ===

A number of modes of operation have been designed to combine secrecy and authentication in a single cryptographic primitive. Examples of such modes are , , integrity-aware parallelizable mode (IAPM), OCB, EAX, CWC, CCM, and GCM. Authenticated encryption modes are classified as single-pass modes or double-pass modes.

In addition, some modes also allow for the authentication of unencrypted associated data, and these are called AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) schemes. For example, EAX mode is a double-pass AEAD scheme while OCB mode is single-pass.

====Galois/counter (GCM)====

Galois/counter mode (GCM) combines the well-known counter mode of encryption with the new Galois mode of authentication. The key feature is the ease of parallel computation of the Galois field multiplication used for authentication. This feature permits higher throughput than encryption algorithms.

GCM is defined for block ciphers with a block size of 128 bits. Galois message authentication code (GMAC) is an authentication-only variant of the GCM which can form an incremental message authentication code. Both GCM and GMAC can accept initialization vectors of arbitrary length. GCM can take full advantage of parallel processing and implementing GCM can make efficient use of an instruction pipeline or a hardware pipeline. The CBC mode of operation incurs pipeline stalls that hamper its efficiency and performance.

Like in CTR, blocks are numbered sequentially, and then this block number is combined with an IV and encrypted with a block cipher , usually AES. The result of this encryption is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. Like all counter modes, this is essentially a stream cipher, and so it is essential that a different IV is used for each stream that is encrypted.

The ciphertext blocks are considered coefficients of a polynomial which is then evaluated at a key-dependent point , using finite field arithmetic. The result is then encrypted, producing an authentication tag that can be used to verify the integrity of the data. The encrypted text then contains the IV, ciphertext, and authentication tag.

==== Counter with cipher block chaining message authentication code (CCM) ====

&quot;Counter with cipher block chaining message authentication code&quot; (counter with CBC-MAC; CCM) is an authenticated encryption algorithm designed to provide both authentication and confidentiality. CCM mode is only defined for block ciphers with a block length of 128 bits.

==== Synthetic initialization vector (SIV) ====

Synthetic initialization vector (SIV) is a nonce-misuse resistant block cipher mode.

SIV synthesizes an internal IV using the pseudorandom function S2V. S2V is a keyed hash based on CMAC, and the input to the function is:
* Additional authenticated data (zero, one or many AAD fields are supported)
* Plaintext
* Authentication key (K).

SIV encrypts the S2V output and the plaintext using AES-CTR, keyed with the encryption key (K).

SIV can support external nonce-based authenticated encryption, in which case one of the authenticated data fields is utilized for this purpose. RFC5297 specifies that for interoperability purposes the last authenticated data field should be used external nonce.

Owing to the use of two keys, the authentication key K and encryption key K, naming schemes for SIV AEAD-variants may lead to some confusion; for example AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256 refers to AES-SIV with two AES-128 keys and not AES-256.

==== AES-GCM-SIV ====

AES-GCM-SIV is a mode of operation for the Advanced Encryption Standard which provides similar performance to Galois/counter mode as well as misuse resistance in the event of the reuse of a cryptographic nonce. The construction is defined in RFC 8452.

AES-GCM-SIV synthesizes the internal IV. It derives a hash of the additional authenticated data and plaintext using the POLYVAL Galois hash function. The hash is then encrypted an AES-key, and used as authentication tag and AES-CTR initialization vector.

AES-GCM-SIV is an improvement over the very similarly named algorithm GCM-SIV, with a few very small changes (e.g. how AES-CTR is initialized), but which yields practical benefits to its security &quot;This addition allows for encrypting up to 250 messages with the same key, compared to the significant limitation of only 232 messages that were allowed with GCM-SIV.&quot;

===Confidentiality only modes===

Many modes of operation have been defined. Some of these are described below. The purpose of cipher modes is to mask patterns which exist in encrypted data, as illustrated in the description of the weakness of ECB.

Different cipher modes mask patterns by cascading outputs from the cipher block or other globally deterministic variables into the subsequent cipher block. The inputs of the listed modes are summarized in the following table:


Note: &quot;g&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) is any deterministic function, often the identity function.

====Electronic codebook (ECB)====

The simplest of the encryption modes is the electronic codebook (ECB) mode (named after conventional physical codebooks). The message is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately. ECB is not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols: the disadvantage of this method is a lack of diffusion, wherein it fails to hide data patterns when it encrypts identical plaintext blocks into identical ciphertext blocks.



A striking example of the degree to which ECB can leave plaintext data patterns in the ciphertext can be seen when ECB mode is used to encrypt a bitmap image which contains large areas of uniform color. While the color of each individual pixel has supposedly been encrypted, the overall image may still be discerned, as the pattern of identically colored pixels in the original remains visible in the encrypted version.

ECB mode can also make protocols without integrity protection even more susceptible to replay attacks, since each block gets decrypted in exactly the same way.
====Cipher block chaining (CBC)====

Ehrsam, Meyer, Smith and Tuchman invented the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of operation in 1976. In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This way, each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point. To make each message unique, an initialization vector must be used in the first block.

If the first block has index 1, the mathematical formula for CBC encryption is
: formula_1
: formula_2

while the mathematical formula for CBC decryption is
: formula_3
: formula_4

===== Example =====
CBC has been the most commonly used mode of operation. Its main drawbacks are that encryption is sequential (i.e., it cannot be parallelized), and that the message must be padded to a multiple of the cipher block size. One way to handle this last issue is through the method known as ciphertext stealing. Note that a one-bit change in a plaintext or initialization vector (IV) affects all following ciphertext blocks.

Decrypting with the incorrect IV causes the first block of plaintext to be corrupt but subsequent plaintext blocks will be correct. This is because each block is XORed with the ciphertext of the previous block, not the plaintext, so one does not need to decrypt the previous block before using it as the IV for the decryption of the current one. This means that a plaintext block can be recovered from two adjacent blocks of ciphertext. As a consequence, decryption &quot;can&quot; be parallelized. Note that a one-bit change to the ciphertext causes complete corruption of the corresponding block of plaintext, and inverts the corresponding bit in the following block of plaintext, but the rest of the blocks remain intact. This peculiarity is exploited in different padding oracle attacks, such as POODLE.

&quot;Explicit initialization vectors&quot; take advantage of this property by prepending a single random block to the plaintext. Encryption is done as normal, except the IV does not need to be communicated to the decryption routine. Whatever IV decryption uses, only the random block is &quot;corrupted&quot;. It can be safely discarded and the rest of the decryption is the original plaintext.

====Propagating cipher block chaining (PCBC)====

The &quot;propagating cipher block chaining&quot; or &quot;plaintext cipher-block chaining&quot; mode was designed to cause small changes in the ciphertext to propagate indefinitely when decrypting, as well as when encrypting. In PCBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with both the previous plaintext block and the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. Like with CBC mode, an initialization vector is used in the first block.
Unlike CBC, decrypting PCBC with the incorrect IV (initialization vector) causes all blocks of plaintext to be corrupt.


Encryption and decryption algorithms are as follows:
: formula_5
: formula_6

PCBC is used in Kerberos v4 and WASTE, most notably, but otherwise is not common. 

On a message encrypted in PCBC mode, if two adjacent ciphertext blocks are exchanged, this does not affect the decryption of subsequent blocks. For this reason, PCBC is not used in Kerberos v5.

====Cipher feedback (CFB)====

=====Full-block CFB=====

The &quot;cipher feedback&quot; (CFB) mode, in its simplest form uses the entire output of the block cipher. In this variation, it is very similar to CBC, turning a block cipher into a self-synchronizing stream cipher. CFB decryption in this variation is almost identical to CBC encryption performed in reverse:
: formula_7


===== CFB-1, CFB-8, CFB-64, CFB-128, etc. =====
NIST SP800-38A defines CFB with a bit-width. &quot;The CFB mode also requires an integer parameter, denoted s, such that 1 ≤ s ≤ b. In the specification of the CFB mode below, each plaintext segment (Pj) and ciphertext segment (Cj) consists of s bits. The value of s is sometimes incorporated into the name of the mode, e.g., the 1-bit CFB mode, the 8-bit CFB mode, the 64-bit CFB mode, or the 128-bit CFB mode.&quot;

These modes will truncate the output of the underlying block cipher.
: formula_8
: formula_9
: formula_10
: formula_11

CFB-1 is considered self synchronizing and resilient to loss of ciphertext; &quot;When the 1-bit CFB mode is used, then the synchronization is automatically restored b+1 positions after the inserted or deleted bit. For other values of s in the CFB mode, and for the other confidentiality modes in this recommendation, the synchronization must be restored externally.&quot; (NIST SP800-38A). I.e. 1-bit loss in a 128-bit-wide block cipher like AES will render 129 invalid bits before emitting valid bits.

CFB may also self synchronize in some special cases other than those specified. For example, a one bit change in CFB-128 with an underlying 128 bit block cipher, will re-synchronize after two blocks. (However, CFB-128 etc. will not handle bit loss gracefully; a one-bit loss will cause the decryptor to lose alignment with the encryptor)

=====CFB compared to other modes=====
Like CBC mode, changes in the plaintext propagate forever in the ciphertext, and encryption cannot be parallelized. Also like CBC, decryption can be parallelized.

CFB, OFB and CTR share two advantages over CBC mode: the block cipher is only ever used in the encrypting direction, and the message does not need to be padded to a multiple of the cipher block size (though ciphertext stealing can also be used for CBC mode to make padding unnecessary).

====Output feedback (OFB)====

The &quot;output feedback&quot; (OFB) mode makes a block cipher into a synchronous stream cipher. It generates keystream blocks, which are then XORed with the plaintext blocks to get the ciphertext. Just as with other stream ciphers, flipping a bit in the ciphertext produces a flipped bit in the plaintext at the same location. This property allows many error-correcting codes to function normally even when applied before encryption.

Because of the symmetry of the XOR operation, encryption and decryption are exactly the same:
: formula_12
: formula_13
: formula_14
: formula_15
: formula_8

Each output feedback block cipher operation depends on all previous ones, and so cannot be performed in parallel. However, because the plaintext or ciphertext is only used for the final XOR, the block cipher operations may be performed in advance, allowing the final step to be performed in parallel once the plaintext or ciphertext is available.

It is possible to obtain an OFB mode keystream by using CBC mode with a constant string of zeroes as input. This can be useful, because it allows the usage of fast hardware implementations of CBC mode for OFB mode encryption.

Using OFB mode with a partial block as feedback like CFB mode reduces the average cycle length by a factor of 232 or more. A mathematical model proposed by Davies and Parkin and substantiated by experimental results showed that only with full feedback an average cycle length near to the obtainable maximum can be achieved. For this reason, support for truncated feedback was removed from the specification of OFB.

====Counter (CTR)====

: Note: CTR mode (CM) is also known as &quot;integer counter mode&quot; (ICM) and &quot;segmented integer counter&quot; (SIC) mode.

Like OFB, counter mode turns a block cipher into a stream cipher. It generates the next keystream block by encrypting successive values of a &quot;counter&quot;. The counter can be any function which produces a sequence which is guaranteed not to repeat for a long time, although an actual increment-by-one counter is the simplest and most popular. The usage of a simple deterministic input function used to be controversial; critics argued that &quot;deliberately exposing a cryptosystem to a known systematic input represents an unnecessary risk&quot;. However, today CTR mode is widely accepted, and any problems are considered a weakness of the underlying block cipher, which is expected to be secure regardless of systemic bias in its input. Along with CBC, CTR mode is one of two block cipher modes recommended by Niels Ferguson and Bruce Schneier.

CTR mode was introduced by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1979.

CTR mode has similar characteristics to OFB, but also allows a random-access property during decryption. CTR mode is well suited to operate on a multi-processor machine, where blocks can be encrypted in parallel. Furthermore, it does not suffer from the short-cycle problem that can affect OFB.

If the IV/nonce is random, then they can be combined with the counter using any invertible operation (concatenation, addition, or XOR) to produce the actual unique counter block for encryption. In case of a non-random nonce (such as a packet counter), the nonce and counter should be concatenated (e.g., storing the nonce in the upper 64 bits and the counter in the lower 64 bits of a 128-bit counter block). Simply adding or XORing the nonce and counter into a single value would break the security under a chosen-plaintext attack in many cases, since the attacker may be able to manipulate the entire IV–counter pair to cause a collision. Once an attacker controls the IV–counter pair and plaintext, XOR of the ciphertext with the known plaintext would yield a value that, when XORed with the ciphertext of the other block sharing the same IV–counter pair, would decrypt that block.

Note that the nonce in this diagram is equivalent to the initialization vector (IV) in the other diagrams. However, if the offset/location information is corrupt, it will be impossible to partially recover such data due to the dependence on byte offset.


==Error propagation==
&quot;Error propagation&quot; properties describe how a decryption behaves during bit errors, i.e. how error in one bit cascades to different decrypted bits.

Bit errors may occur intentionally in attacks or randomly due to transmission errors.

* Random bit errors occur independently in any bit position with an expected probability of ½.
* Specific bit errors occur in the same bit position(s) as the original bit error(s).

* Specific bit errors in stream cipher modes (OFB, CTR, etc.) are trivial. They affect only the specific bit intended. 
* Specific bit errors in more complex modes such (e.g. CBC): adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack may intelligently combine many different specific bit errors to break the cipher mode. In Padding oracle attack, CBC can be decrypted in the attack by guessing encryption secrets based on error responses. The Padding Oracle attack variant &quot;CBC-R&quot; (CBC Reverse) lets the attacker construct any valid message.

For modern authenticated encryption (AEAD) or protocols with message authentication codes chained in MAC-Then-Encrypt order, any bit error should completely abort decryption and must not generate any specific bit errors to decryptor. I.e. if decryption succeeded, there should not be any bit error. As such error propagation is less important subject in modern cipher modes than in traditional confidentiality-only modes.
(Source: SP800-38A Table D.2: Summary of Effect of Bit Errors on Decryption)

It might be observed, for example, that a one-block error in the transmitted ciphertext would result in a one-block error in the reconstructed plaintext for ECB mode encryption, while in CBC mode such an error would affect two blocks. Some felt that such resilience was desirable in the face of random errors (e.g., line noise), while others argued that error correcting increased the scope for attackers to maliciously tamper with a message.

However, when proper integrity protection is used, such an error will result (with high probability) in the entire message being rejected. If resistance to random error is desirable, error-correcting codes should be applied to the ciphertext before transmission.

==Other modes and other cryptographic primitives==
Many more modes of operation for block ciphers have been suggested. Some have been accepted, fully described (even standardized), and are in use. Others have been found insecure, and should never be used. Still others don&#x27;t categorize as confidentiality, authenticity, or authenticated encryption – for example key feedback mode and Davies–Meyer hashing.

NIST maintains a list of proposed modes for block ciphers at &quot;Modes Development&quot;.

Disk encryption often uses special purpose modes specifically designed for the application. Tweakable narrow-block encryption modes (LRW, XEX, and XTS) and wide-block encryption modes (CMC and EME) are designed to securely encrypt sectors of a disk (see disk encryption theory).

Many modes use an initialization vector (IV) which, depending on the mode, may have requirements such as being only used once (a nonce) or being unpredictable ahead of its publication, etc. Reusing an IV with the same key in CTR, GCM or OFB mode results in XORing the same keystream with two or more plaintexts, a clear misuse of a stream, with a catastrophic loss of security. Deterministic authenticated encryption modes such as the NIST Key Wrap algorithm and the SIV (RFC 5297) AEAD mode do not require an IV as an input, and return the same ciphertext and authentication tag every time for a given plaintext and key. Other IV misuse-resistant modes such as AES-GCM-SIV benefit from an IV input, for example in the maximum amount of data that can be safely encrypted with one key, while not failing catastrophically if the same IV is used multiple times.

Block ciphers can also be used in other cryptographic protocols. They are generally used in modes of operation similar to the block modes described here. As with all protocols, to be cryptographically secure, care must be taken to design these modes of operation correctly.

There are several schemes which use a block cipher to build a cryptographic hash function. See one-way compression function for descriptions of several such methods.

Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can also be built using block ciphers.

Message authentication codes (MACs) are often built from block ciphers. CBC-MAC, OMAC and PMAC are examples.

<doc id="160203" wikidata="Q152935" url="?curid=160203" title="George II of Greece">
<text>George II (; 19 July Old Style: 7 July] 1890 – 1 April 1947) was King of Greece from 27 September 1922 until 25 March 1924, and again from 25 November 1935 until his death on 1 April 1947.

The eldest son of King Constantine I of Greece and Princess Sophia of Prussia, George followed his father into exile in 1917 following the National Schism, while his younger brother Alexander was installed as king. Constantine was restored to the throne in 1920 after Alexander&#x27;s death, but was forced to abdicate two years later in the aftermath of the Greco-Turkish War. George acceded to the Greek throne, but after a failed royalist coup in October 1923 he was exiled to Romania. Greece was proclaimed a republic in March 1924 and George was formally deposed and stripped of Greek nationality. He remained in exile until the Greek monarchy was restored in 1935, following a rigged referendum, upon which he resumed his royal duties. The king supported Ioannis Metaxas&#x27; 1936 self-coup, which established an authoritarian, nationalist and anti-communist dictatorship known as 4th of August Regime.

Greece was overrun following a German invasion in April 1941, forcing George into his third exile. He left for Crete and then Egypt before settling in London, where he headed the Greek government-in-exile. At the end of the war, George returned to Greece after a 1946 referendum had preserved the monarchy. He died of arteriosclerosis in April 1947 at the age of 56. Having no children, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Paul.

==Early life==
===Birth and childhood===

George was born at the royal villa at Tatoi, near Athens, the eldest son of Crown Prince Constantine of Greece and his wife, Sophia of Prussia. George was a great-grandson of both Christian IX of Denmark, the &quot;father-in-law of Europe&quot;, and of Queen Victoria, the &quot;grandmother of Europe&quot;. George was born nine months after his parents married. Queen Victoria speculated that George was premature, being born a week before his due date. During George&#x27;s birth, his mother struggled and George&#x27;s umbilical cord was strapped around his neck. A German midwife, who was sent specially by his grandmother, Victoria, Princess Royal, assisted in George&#x27;s birth. George was named after his paternal grandfather, King George I of Greece, following traditional Greek naming practices. He was baptized on 18 August [Old Style: 5 August] 1890 by multiple Godparents, including Queen Victoria.

George was the eldest of six siblings, born between 1890 and 1913, and spent most of his childhood in Athens in a villa on Kifisias Avenue in the former Presidential Mansion, which was the residence of the Crown Prince. The mansion is now the official residence of the President of Greece. As a child, George also made numerous visits to Great Britain, where he stayed for several weeks to visit his British relatives. The Greek royals often stayed in Seaford and Eastbourne. George also made visits to Germany to see his mother&#x27;s family and they stayed in Schlosshotel Kronberg with his grandmother, Victoria, but also took summer holidays in Corfu and Venice, travelling on their private yacht, &quot;Amphritrite IV&quot;.

George has been described by historians John Van der Kiste and Vicente Mateos Sáinz de Medrano as the most introverted and distant of his siblings, having been aware of his role as heir from a young age. Van der Kiste presents George as a child who often misbehaved, especially during visits to Germany, but less turbulent than his younger brother, Alexander, who was described as mischievous, and less sporty his younger sister, Helen, who was seen as a tomboy.

===Goudi coup and Balkan Wars===
George pursued a military career, training with the Prussian Guard at the age of 18, then serving in the Balkan Wars as a member of the 1st Infantry Regiment. George received a military education as the heir to the throne. He was trained at the Hellenic Military Academy in Athens, which allowed him to enroll in Greece&#x27;s infantry as a second lieutenant on 27 May [Old Style: 14 May] 1909. However, a few months after he joined, on 15 August [Old Style: 2 August] 1909, a group of military officers organised a coup d&#x27;état against George I, the concurrent king and grandfather of George. The coup d&#x27;état became known as the Goudi coup and was led by Nikolaos Zorbas, who declared himself a monarchist, but campaigned for the dismissal of all princes from the army. Zorbas argued that dismissing princely soldiers would protect the popularity of the royal family. However, it is argued by Van der Kiste that many of the officers involved in the coup blamed the high-ranking princes for the defeat of Greece in the 1897 Greco-Turkish War. They particularly placed blame on George&#x27;s father, Crown Prince Constantine, believing that the royal family was monopolising the highest army positions.

Some of the officers involved in the coup believed that the country would be better off if King George I was deposed and replaced by another neutral candidate, such as by George, his grandson. Proposed candidates included the Austrian duke Francis of Teck or a member of the German royal House of Hohenzollern. However, George was the most desirable candidate as he was more popular than his father, was an adult and was politically inexperienced, so was seen as easily more controllable. Violence sparked by the coup continued until February 1910 and members of the royal family were forced to resign from the military in order to avoid a revolution. George, his siblings and his parents evacuated Greece and moved to Germany for three years in exile. To avoid controversy, their exile was branded as a three-year &quot;education leave&quot;, which was approved and so George continued his military training, but with the prestigious First Foot Guards Regiment of the Prussian army. This period of absence from Greece reduced his popularity as a potential replacement for his grandfather.

As Greece became more politically stable as violent protests lessened, George, his siblings and his parents returned to Greece at the end of 1910. In 1911, Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos allowed members of the royal family to be given back their former ranks in the military, but George returned to Germany to continue training with the Prussian army. When the First Balkan War commenced in October 1912, George returned to Greece to fight against the Ottoman Empire. George and his brother, Alexander, served as officers on his father&#x27;s staff. George served in numerous battles, which was criticised by the media as it put the country&#x27;s future monarch as risk of being killed. One such battle that George participated in was the capture of Thessaloniki on 8 November [Old Style: 26 October] 1912, which marked major progress for Greece in the war.

==Crown Prince==
===World War I===

On 18 March [Old Style: 5 March] 1913, George&#x27;s grandfather and the reigning king, George I, was assassinated while taking his daily walk in Thessaloniki. Crown Prince Constantine, whose popularity had grown due to Greece&#x27;s successes in the First Balkan War, acceded to the throne as King Constantine I. George thus became the Crown Prince of Greece at age 23. In the early weeks of being crown prince, George and his family moved to their new residence, where George developed a close friendship with his uncle, Prince Christopher, who was only two years older than him. On 30 June [Old Style: 17 June] 1913, the Second Balkan War broke out between Bulgaria and its former allies, which included Greece. Relations between Greece and many of its Balkan allies grew during the war, notably with Romania, which paved the way towards the marriage between George and his future wife, Elisabeth of Romania, the daughter of King Ferdinand I and Queen Marie of Romania. When Greece and its allies won the war in August 1913, George and his family resumed their European trips. George accompanied his father on a state visit to Berlin and received the Order of the Red Eagle from his uncle, Wilhelm II, the German Kaiser. The following summer, George travelled to the United Kingdom with Christopher and was in London when he heard of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914.

The assassination sparked the outbreak of World War I, in which Constantine wished to maintain Greece&#x27;s neutrality. Constantine believed that Greece was unready to fight after its involvement in the Balkan Wars and also feared displeasing his brother-in-law, Wilhelm II. Opposition soon accused Constantine of supporting the Triple Alliance, made up of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy, and relations between him and Venizelos, who believed that Greece should side with the Triple Entente, made up of Great Britain, France and Russia, quickly deteriorated. The entire Greek government, supported by the French government, soon declared in October 1916 that siding with the Entente was their preferred option. Central Greece was occupied by the Western Allies, an extension of the Triple Entente, and a National Schism between supporters of Constantine and supporters of Venizelos broke out. Constantine refused to alter his opinion and his popularity heavily decreased. A fire in Tatoi Palace broke out on 14 July [Old Style: 1 July] 1916 and French agents were blamed for it. Multiple members of the royal family were close fatalities of it. Though George was not present at the time, his younger sister, Princess Katherine, who was only three years old, was carried into the palace woods for two kilometres to be saved. Between sixteen and eighteen people, made up of firefighters and palace staff, died.

On 19 June [Old Style: 6 June] 1917, French politician and leader of the Entente Charles Jonnart ordered George&#x27;s father, Constantine, to abdicate. Due to worry of the impending Allied invasion at Piraeus, Constantine agreed to be placed in exile without having to abdicate. The Allies were against establishing a republic in Greece and thus looked for a replacement. George&#x27;s name was put forward, but the Allies perceived him as a germanophile, like his father, due to his links to the Prussian army and German imperial family. George&#x27;s uncle, Prince George, was offered the position, but he refused out of loyalty to Constantine. Ultimately, George&#x27;s younger brother, Alexander, was chosen by Venizelos and the Entente to replace Constantine.

On 10 June [Old Style: 28 May] 1917, Alexander officially ascended to the throne in a small ceremony that was only attended by George and former prime minister Alexandros Zaimis. In addition, , the Archbishop of Athens and All Greece, did not attend. The ceremony is kept secret from the public and there are no state celebrations that occur. Alexander, who was only 23 years old, was described as having a &quot;broken voice&quot; and teary eyes when he took the oath of loyalty to the constitution. Historians, such as Van der Kiste, argue that he was fearful of dealing with his opponents and the fact that his reign was illegitimate according to succession laws. Neither Constantine nor George had renounced their rights to the throne, and Constantine told Alexander that he viewed him as the country&#x27;s regent, not monarch. On the evening of the ceremony, Alexander moved from the future presidential mansion in inner Athens to Tatoi. George and all other members of the royal family had planned to leave for exile, however crowds of people protested outside the mansion to prevent them from leaving, so they had to escape in secret the following day. They reached the port of Oropos and fled the country due to the war. This was the final time that George had contact with his brother, Alexander.

===First exile===
George and his family settled in Switzerland, first in Saint Moritz and then in Zürich. Almost all members of the royal family moved with them after Venizelos returned to power as head of the Cabinet and organised Greece&#x27;s entry into World War I. The family were financially strained and Constantine soon became ill. He almost died in 1918 upon also contracting the Spanish flu. At the Treaty of Sèvres and Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, part of the end of World War I, Greece made territorial gains in Thrace and Anatolia. Although initially seen as gains to the country, Greece soon fell into the Second Greco-Turkish War in 1919. Tension between Venizelos and the royal family remained high and was not helped when Alexander decided to marry aristocrat Aspasia Manos, rather than a foreign royal, which dismayed Venizelos. Venizelos saw this decision as a missed opportunity to move closer to Great Britain.

According to historian Marlene Eilers Koenig, George was in love with his cousin Anastasia de Torby, however their relationship was opposed by George&#x27;s mother, Sophia, as Anastasia was the result of a morganatic marriage. George later became engaged in October 1920 to Elisabeth of Romania, who had been in touch with George since 1911. George had previously asked Elisabeth to marry in 1914, but she declined off the advice of her great-aunt, Elisabeth of Wied, who thought of George as being two small and too English. Elisabeth herself had declared that George was a prince whom God had forgotten to complete. Her feelings remain the same when the pair meet in Switzerland, however she accepted on the basis of her own imperfections. Although George&#x27;s family had lost most of their wealth in exile, the Romanian royal family swiftly invited George and Elisabeth to return to Bucharest, in Romania, to announce their engagement.

===Greco-Turkish war===

George was in Romania when Alexander died following an infection from a monkey bite in 1920. Parliament continued to refuse the crown to either George or Constantine, so it was offered to Constantine&#x27;s third son, Paul, who refused to break the legitimate line of succession. Greece was making no progress in the Greco-Turkish War and in the 1920 Greek legislative election, Venizelos was voted out of office. Dimitrios Rallis, a monarchist, was appointed prime minister and the 1920 Greek referendum restored Constantine to the throne. According to Van der Kiste, the referendum was most likely rigged by Rallis. Before Venizelos fled to Constantinople in exile, he asked George&#x27;s grandmother, Olga Constantinovna, to act as regent while Constantine returned to Greece. On 19 December, George returned to Greece as the crown prince under his father&#x27;s second reign. Many portraits of Venizelos were torn down in state celebrations and replaced with photos of the royal family. Upon their return, the royals made numerous balcony appearances to please the large crowd that had turned out to see them return.

A few weeks later, on 27 February [Old Style: 14 February] 1921, George married Elisabeth in Bucharest. Two weeks later, George&#x27;s younger sister, Helen, married Elisabeth&#x27;s brother, Crown Prince Carol of Romania, in Athens. Constantine&#x27;s restoration to the Greek throne was opposed by the former Allies of World War I, and thus Greece received minimal support in the Greco-Turkish War against Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s Turkey. The former Allies stated that they were not ready to provide support, and continued to hold distaste against Constantine. For example, at the wedding of Princess Helen and Crown Prince Carol, the British ambassador and his wife refused to greet Constantine and Sophia.

In response to the ongoing war, Constantine quickly assumed the role of commander-in-chief of the army and resided in Asia Minor from May to September 1921. George served as a colonel, and later a major general in the war. He travelled with his father to Smyrna and other battlefronts, where he visited wounded Greek soldiers and civilians in hospital. Greece was pushed back from the Anatolian lands granted to them in the Treaty of Sèvres to Ankara and suffered heavy defeats at the Battle of Sakarya in August and September 1921. The royal family became more criticised and Greek media turned against George and two of his uncles when they made comments critiquing Venizelos. Prince Andrew, the father of the future Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, fled from Asia Minor before Greece&#x27;s defeat at Sakarya, which was mocked by Turkish forces. In the next few months, Greek forces continued to be defeated and slowly retreated towards Smyrna, while George was stationed in Ionia and Elisabeth joined the Red Cross to help Christian refugees who had escaped villages that had fallen to the Turkish army. Elisabeth&#x27;s distance from George furthers her struggles of integrating into the Greek culture. Mateos Sáinz de Medrano documents that Elisabeth was jealous of the successes of her sister, Queen Maria of Yugoslavia.

Elisabeth had been pregnant since her and George&#x27;s marriage, but suffered a miscarriage while travelling to Smyrna. Some historians argue that her miscarriage was actually the abortion of an illegitimate child that was the result of an affair between her and British diplomat Frank Rattigan, the father of Terence Rattigan. Elisabeth soon contracted typhoid, pleurisy and depression, before returning to Bucharest. Though George and Elisabeth&#x27;s mother were attempting to convince her to return to Greece, her health never fully recovered after her miscarriage. Simultaneously, Turkish forces had organised an invasion of Smyrna, which fell on 9 September [Old Style: 27 August] 1922. Around two weeks later, the city was ransacked and burned. An estimated tens of thousands of Greeks and Armenians were killed, which influenced a greater degree of republicanism in Athens. When the Turks again defeated Greece at the Battle of Dumlupınar, a sector of the military, led by colonels Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylianos Gonatas, demanded the abdication of Constantine and the dissolution of the parliament.

==First reign==
To avoid more unrest, Constantine officially abdicated on 27 September [Old Style: 14 September] 1922 and moved to Italy with Sophia and his daughters in exile, while George prepared to become the monarch. George left for Bucharest to retrieve his wife and the pair returned to Greece to be crowned. George officially ascended to the throne as George II, but did not receive a happy reception and faced harsh criticism. In Greece, there had been greater political instability since the 1922 Greek coup d&#x27;état, which influenced Constantine&#x27;s abdication, and a large influx of refugees from Asia Minor as a result of the war. Supporters of Venizelos still maintained a high degree of influence and power in the country, with Plastiras and Gonatas leading the country. George and Elisabeth were confined to Tatoi and were highly monitored by the government, while George worried about the growing instability in Greece and criticism from the former Allies, who had previously refused to recognise Constantine&#x27;s second reign.

Between 13 October and 28 November 1922, the Trial of the Six took place and saw the punishment of numerous monarchist politicians who had opposed the Venizelos administration. The verdict of the trial resulted in former prime ministers Dimitrios Gounaris, Petros Protopapadakis and Nikolaos Stratos, as well as politicians Georgios Baltatzis, Nikolaos Theotokis and Georgios Hatzanestis, being shot on 28 November. All six of them had been strong supporters of the monarchy and their executions were to the dismay of George, who had lost his right to pardon and could not intervene in the trial. Continued opposition to the royal family was occurring, such as the arrest of Prince Andrew on 26 October at the royal residence of Mon Repos on Corfu. Andrew was later transported to Athens and imprisoned for &quot;disobeying an order&quot; and &quot;acting on his own initiative&quot; during battles in Anatolia. The Greek government was criticised by George V of the United Kingdom, Alfonso XIII of Spain and Pope Pius XI, before Andrew&#x27;s sentence was reduced to capital banishment in order to avoid sanctions. On 5 December [Old Style: 22 November], a British ship was sent to transport Andrew and his family, including the young Prince Philip, out of Greece and to Britain, to the dismay of George.

Constantine died in Palermo on 11 January 1923 [Old Style: 29 December 1922] without being granted a state funeral, which left George considering abdication. General Ioannis Metaxas, who was a supporter of the monarchy, encouraged George to stay in the country with the hope that instability would gradually reduce. Following a failed royalist coup d&#x27;état in October 1923, the Greek government, led by the republican prime minister, Gonatas, asked George to leave the country while the National Assembly considered the question of the future form of government. Though most likely uninvolved, George was accused of initiating the coup d&#x27;état, and Plastiras and Theodoros Pangalos openly campaigned for the abolition of the monarchy for the first time. The 1923 Greek legislative election determined that Venizelos would replace Gonatas, however before the changeover in government, Gonatas demanded that George leave the country. George complied and although he refused to abdicate, George departed on 19 December 1923 for exile in his wife&#x27;s home nation of Romania. Before fleeing, George was described as a cold and aloof man, who rarely inspired love or affection from his subjects. Many commented that his moody, sullen personality seemed more appropriate for his ancestral homeland of Denmark than Greece. Furthermore, George&#x27;s long years spent living abroad had caused him to struggle in identifying with the Greek culture.

==Second exile==
The Second Hellenic Republic was proclaimed by parliament on 25 March 1924, before being confirmed by the 1924 Greek republic referendum two and a half weeks later. George and Elisabeth were officially deposed and banished, along with all members of the royal family, who were stripped of their Greek citizenship. Royal properties were also confiscated by the government of the new republic. Rendered stateless, they were issued new passports from their cousin, Christian X of Denmark. Exiled in Romania from December 1923, George and his wife settled in Bucharest, where Elisabeth&#x27;s parents, King Ferdinand and Queen Marie, put at their disposal a wing of the Cotroceni Palace for some time. After several weeks however, the couple moved and established their residence in a more modest villa on Victory Avenue. As regular guests of the Romanian sovereigns, George and Elisabeth took part in the ceremonies which punctuated the life of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family. Despite the kindness with which his mother-in-law treated him, George felt idle in Bucharest and struggled to hide the boredom he felt from the splendors of the Romanian court.
After their exile, financial difficulties and absence of children, George and Elisabeth&#x27;s marriage deteriorated. Elisabeth carried out multiple extra-marital affairs with various married men. When visiting her sick sister, Maria, in Belgrade, she reportedly flirted with her own brother-in-law, Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Later, she began an affair with her husband&#x27;s banker, a Greek named Alexandros Scavani, whom she made her chamberlain to cover up the scandal. In exile, George stayed half the year in Romania with Elisabeth, and the other half living with his mother at Villa Bobolina in Tuscany, either with or without his wife. George eventually moved to the United Kingdom, where he had numerous extended family members and friends. On 16 September 1930, George was initiated into Freemasonry in London and became venerable master of the Wellwood Lodge in 1933. After the death of Sophia in 1932, George chose to permanently leave Bucharest and his wife to establish his residence in London. Accompanied by his squire, Major Dimitrios Levidis, and one of his servants, Mitso Panteleos, George rented a small suite with two rooms at Brown&#x27;s Hotel in Mayfair.

George still lacked much wealth and received a mixed reception in Britain, where he was criticised for his relations with Wilhelm II. In London, George was finally reunited with Andrew and his wife. George also regularly attended hunting trips in Scotland with his companions and members of the British royal family, who he frequently went to pubs and antique dealers with. George became quite knowledgeable in old furniture and English silverware. George avoided mentioning his political views or any plans for restoring the Greek monarchy, but made himself clear that he would return as monarch if asked to and that he still considered himself Greek. George attended the wedding of his cousin, Marina, and George, Duke of Kent, in Greek army uniform. After the wedding celebrations had concluded, George left on a trip to British India for several months. Under Freeman Freeman-Thomas, the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, George was treated as the sovereign of Greece and met numerous officials stationed there, while being enthusiastically interested in the Indian culture. During his stay, George fell in love with a young woman named Joyce Wallach, who was married to John Britten-Jones, the aide-de-camp to the Governor of India. Wallach filed for divorce and moved back to London with George, however would continue to have numerous affairs up until George&#x27;s death in 1947. On 6 July 1935, George learned through the newspaper that Elisabeth had filed for divorce after she accused him of &quot;desertion from the family home&quot;. A court in Bucharest processed the divorce without inviting George to attend.

==Second reign==
===Restoration of the monarchy===
After the abolition of the monarchy in 1924, leaders who opposed Venizelos, except for Metaxas, refused to recognise the new regime. This &quot;regime issue&quot; that arose just after the proclamation of the republic, haunted Greek politics for more than a decade and eventually led to the restoration of monarchy. In just over ten years, Greece had twenty-three governments, thirteen coup d&#x27;états and one dictatorship. On average, each Cabinet lasted six months and a coup d&#x27;état was organised every 42 weeks. Having failed to restore political instability, the republicanism movement in Greece became criticised and opposed by the public. Gradually, there were more and more protests that voiced to restore the monarchy. Although most protestors wished to have George reinstalled, there were voices to have a new monarch from a new dynasty be inducted, such as George, Duke of Kent.

On 10 October 1935, General Georgios Kondylis, a former supporter of Venizelos who had suddenly decided to support the monarchist forces, overthrew the government and appointed himself prime minister, replacing Panagis Tsaldaris and Zaimis, who were prime minister and president respectively. Aware of Kondylis&#x27; ultimate aim of restoring the monarchy, George, who had been living at Brown&#x27;s Hotel, demanded a plebiscite be held in order to determine whether he would be reinstalled. Kondylis thus arranged the rigged 1935 Greek plebiscite, both to approve his government and to bring an end to the republic. On 3 November 1935, almost 98% of the reported votes supported the restoration of the monarchy. The balloting was not secret, and participation was compulsory. As &quot;Time&quot; described it at the time, &quot;As a voter one could drop into the ballot box a blue vote for George II and please General George Kondylis ... or one could cast a red ballot for the Republic and get roughed up.&quot;

The organisation of the plebiscite discontented the Greek government. When the election results were announced, a delegation was sent to the Greek embassy in London to officially ask George and his younger brother, Paul, to return to Athens, which they accepted on 5 November 1935. Before returning to Greece, they first travelled to France and Italy. In Paris, George and Prince Andrew were greeted by French President Albert Lebrun and interviewed by French media. George and Paul then travelled to Villa Sparta, Italy, to retrieve their sisters and pay respects to their parents&#x27; graves at the Church of the Nativity of Christ and St. Nicholas, a Russian Orthodox Church in Florence. After a brief stay in Rome with Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, the Greek royals boarded the cruiser &quot;Elli&quot; in Brindisi and returned to Phalerum in Athens on 25 November.

Kondylis lost his status as Regent of Greece, but ensured that George kept him as prime minister, before awarding him with the Grand Cross of the Order of George I. Almost immediately after being restored, George and Kondylis disagreed over the terms of a general amnesty that George wanted to declare, so Kondylis resigned on 30 November 1935 and George appointed Konstantinos Demertzis as interim prime minister. The 1936 Greek legislative election confirmed that communism was gaining popularity within the country. This was perhaps due to the continuing large influx of refugees from Asia Minor, who had been arriving since 1922. In the election, the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) gained fifteen seats, which established it as a buffer between monarchists and republicans. Political instability ensued after the unexpected, but natural, deaths of Demertzis, Kondylis, Venizelos and Tsaldaris. George appointed Metaxas as prime minister on 13 April 1936. Metaxas was opposed by the country&#x27;s communist forces, who were against his policies. Metaxas also told George that he wished to suspend certain articles of the constitution in order to establish a dictatorship.

===Metaxas dictatorship===

On 4 August 1936, George endorsed Metaxas&#x27;s dictatorship, known as the &quot;4th of August Regime&quot;, signing decrees that dissolved the parliament, banned political parties, abolished the constitution and purported to create a &quot;Third Hellenic Civilization&quot;. George, ruling jointly with Metaxas, oversaw a right-wing regime in which political opponents were arrested and strict censorship was imposed. Many books, such as the works of Plato, Thucydides and Xenophon, were banned. Though not branded as a fascist regime, Metaxas&#x27;s dictatorship was arguably quasi-fascist and heavily imitated that of Benito Mussolini in Italy, whom Adolf Hitler had also been inspired by in Germany. George disliked dealing with both Greek politicians and ordinary Greeks, and preferred to let Metaxas undertake tours around the country.. George retained full control of the army and he was largely responsible for foreign policy making. Metaxas&#x27;s support of the monarch has been likened to that of Venizelos with Alexander. Although his reign was mostly guaranteed under the dictatorship, George was weary of Metaxas&#x27; growing power and the influence of the army. George told his cousin, Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia, that he felt so isolated that he could not trust anyone in Greece. To avoid a possible overthrow by Metaxas, George declared to the Greek ambassador to the United Kingdom that he supported Metaxas&#x27;s policies, though he also voiced his concern.

Most of the royal family&#x27;s possessions had been either ransacked, lost or sold during the republic. For example, the Presidential Palace in Athens had been almost completely emptied, its furniture sold by the republican Greek government. When the monarchy was restored, George nor any member of the royal family requested compensation for their lost property. Lacking wealth, George took charge of the restoration and redecoration works of his residencies, which he refurnished by gaining items from auctions and markets. George continued his relationship with Wallach, but it was kept secret from the public and any possible marriage between the pair would not be allowed due to Wallach&#x27;s commoner status. When engagements required a first lady to be present, George would call his sister Katherine or his sister Irene, who were both single at the time. George made very frequent visits back to London, at least once every year, typically at the end of the year, to reunite with his extended family and friends. He was weary of Metaxas when taking these trips and would never be away from Greece for too long. His trips though allowed for the acquisition by Greece of more military equipment and vehicles from Britain. One of George&#x27;s priorities was to retrieve the bodies of his mother and father from Italy. In November 1936, he sent Paul to Florence to recover the bodies of their parents, Constantine and Sophie, and of their grandmother, Olga. They were transferred to Greece by the ship &quot;Averof&quot; and exhibited for the public for six days in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. On 23 November, a small ceremony was held at the Church of the Resurrection at Tatoi. It was attended by members of the royal family and foreign European royals and nobles. George would go on, in 1940, to retrieve the remains of his aunt, Alexandra, who had died in Russia in 1891, from the Soviet Union. This satisfied the wishes of his grandmother.

With George&#x27;s divorce, his relationship with a commoner and his lack of offspring, Paul assumed the role of heir apparent to the throne, however he too was still single. Succession laws were semi-Salic, meaning that one of their uncles or cousins would have to inherit the throne after Paul, however all their uncles were aging and their cousins were estranged from the country. After facing pressure to marry, Paul wedded Frederica of Hanover, the daughter of his cousin, Victoria Louise, and Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, on 9 January 1938. Though a notable amount of dignitaries were in Athens for their wedding, many Greeks feared having another queen who was German and who was the granddaughter of Wilhelm II. Hitler, now the Führer of Nazi Germany, also wished to take advantage of the wedding by incorporating Nazi swastikas into the ceremony. George was quick to oppose this and managed to avoid any Nazi influence on the day. On 1 July 1939, George&#x27;s sister, Irene, married Prince Aimone, Duke of Aosta, a cousin of Victor Emmanuel III and the future King of Croatia. Their wedding in Florence was to the dismay of Mussolini, who forbade the Greek flag from being raised on Italian soil. As a result, George threatened to boycott the ceremony, but Metaxas advised him to attend to avoid further deterioration in Greco-Italian relations.

===World War II===
====Home front====
On 2 June 1940 Frederica gave birth to the future Constantine II. Simultaneously, World War II began to spread across Europe and France collapsed to Nazi Germany under &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;. Fascist Italy soon joined on 10 June as an Axis Power. Mussolini commenced a violent propaganda campaign against Greece and accused George, who had declared Greece&#x27;s neutrality, of harbouring British ships in Greek waters. On 15 August an Italian submarine sunk the &quot;Elli&quot;, which was escorting a ship of pilgrims off Tinos. The Nazi government in Germany proposed mediation between Italy and Greece. Hitler promised that if George, who he saw as an anglophile, abdicated from the throne, Germany would guarantee no Italian invasion of Greece and grant Greece territories off the coast of the Balkans. George was outraged at this proposition and stated, &quot;[The Nazis] would do better to not stick their noses in the affairs of this country if they know what is good for them!&quot; On 28 October 1940 Metaxas rejected an Italian ultimatum demanding the stationing of Italian troops on Greek soil, sparking the Greco-Italian War. Plastiras, head of the opposition-in-exile, proclaimed their support of George and Metaxas. George consequentially took charge of Greek armed forces and established contact with the Allies, while conducting daily war council meetings at the Hotel Grande Bretagne. George travelled up north to support soldiers as well. Greece successfully repelled the Italian invasion and launched a successful counter-attack, eventually occupying the southern half of Italian Albania.

Metaxas died on 29 January 1941 and George refused to set up a government of national unity, despite calls from both wings of politics to do so. George appointed Alexandros Koryzis as the new prime minister and he retained the dictatorial power that Metaxas did. The Invasion of the Balkans by the Axis Powers ensued and the Luftwaffe conducted Operation Punishment on 6 April, in which Belgrade was bombed when the government denounced the Tripartite Pact. On 9 April the Metaxas Line was penetrated by German troops from Bulgaria and Thessaloniki was occupied. Greek forces had to retreat further south as the Axis Powers continued to make progress within Greek borders. On 20 April a squadron of the Greek army surrendered for the first time. Koryzis told George to accept capitulation, but George reportedly burst into anger and gave his intentions of never surrendering. Following Koryzis&#x27; suicide on 18 April 1941 in the face of the rapid German advance, George unable to find a speedy successor, found himself as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of government as well as head of the armed services.

George had thus a unique opportunity to form a broader government of national consensus, and abolish the hated dictatorial regime—whose sole bastion of support he now was. Though urged to this step by the influential British ambassador, Michael Palairet, George refused. Instead, several names were put forward to head a government. George initially proposed Konstantinos Kotzias, one of Metaxas&#x27;s ministers, but his ties to the regime made him an unfeasible choice. Instead, veteran Venizelist general Alexandros Mazarakis-Ainian was given the mandate to form a government, but returned it on 20 April, partly due to his refusal to collaborate with Metaxas&#x27;s hated Security Minister Konstantinos Maniadakis. Other figures, such as the former dictator Pangalos, were also rejected. Finally, Emmanouil Tsouderos, former governor of the Bank of Greece, was chosen, chiefly on account of his known Anglophile sentiments, Venizelist past, and Cretan origin-where with mainland Greece being overrun, the government was preparing to evacuate too. Most Cretans supported Venizelos but were generally seen as anti-monarchical, this appointment was seen as a sop to local sentiment.

On 22 April most members of the royal family were evacuated from the Greek mainland to Crete, but George and Paul remained in Athens until the next day, when they and the government too fled. George established headquarters in Chania, a few weeks before a German airborne attack. Despite defense of the island by Greek, Australian and New Zealand forces, alongside the local population, Crete slowly succumbed to Nazi forces. Hitler had named George the &quot;number one enemy of the Reich in Greece&quot; and George had narrowly escaped German paratroopers, so he decided that the royals and the government were to evacuate. They escaped on HMS &quot;Decoy&quot; and fled to Egypt. For his actions on Crete, George was awarded with the Distinguished Service Order, becoming the only monarch in history to be decorated with the award.

====King-in-exile====

Throughout the Axis occupation, George remained the internationally recognised head of state, backed by the Greek government-in-exile and the Free Greek Forces. However, the British Foreign Office found George exceedingly difficult to deal with. He was deeply obstinate about upholding what he regarded as his royal prerogatives. He proved notably unwilling to compromise with those who wanted a clear break with the 4th of August Regime. He also resisted British pressure to promise to restore the constitution of 1911, under the grounds that doing so would be to admit he acted illegally in suspending parts of the constitution in 1936. As late as 1942, George kept on Cabinet ministers from the Metaxas regime, most notably Maniadakis.

The Greek royals&#x27; presence in Egypt upset Farouk of Egypt and his pro-Italian ministry, forcing George to find a new place of refuge for the family. George VI of the United Kingdom opposed having Frederica in Britain out of worry that she would bring attention to the British royal family&#x27;s German origins. After deliberation, George and Paul only were granted permission to reside in London, with the rest of the family relocating to Cape Town, South Africa. George, Wallach, Paul and Levidis stationed themselves at Claridge&#x27;s in Mayfair. George and Tsouderos organised with Winston Churchill and the British Cabinet the placement of Greek troops in the Middle East and the purification of the Greek army by eliminating communist and Venizelist ideals. However, this provoked republican groups and several mutinies within the army and navy were conducted, which disrupted the Allies&#x27; efficiency in the Levant. On 22 October 1941, George finally, yet reluctantly, drafted with his Cabinet-in-exile, due to pressure from the British government and republican Greek opposition, a decree that would establish a new parliamentary regime and the dissolution of Metaxas&#x27;s dictatorship by restoring the previously abolished articles; articles 5, 6, 10, 12, 14, 20 and 95. The decree was signed on 4 February 1942, finally abolishing the 4th of August Regime. The following month, George and Tsouderos returned to Egypt to organise Greek troops and stayed there until June. George travelled to the United States and met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, before flying to London and then Cairo. In Cairo in March 1943, an official government-in-exile was finally proclaimed.

Perhaps deeply paranoid and insecure, George believed that the British government was plotting to prevent his return to Greece, despite all of the evidence to the contrary. Edward Warner of the Southern Department of the Foreign Office wrote in March 1942 that the king was &quot;under the extraordinary impression that the Foreign Office was &#x27;pro-Republican and anti-himself&#x27;&quot;. The British ambassador to the government-in-exile, Sir Reginald Leeper, noted that the king&#x27;s coldness did not win him many friends, writing: &quot;Amongst these vivacious, talkative and intensely political southerners he is very much the reserved northerner who damps the ardour of those who might otherwise acclaim him&quot;. Leeper noted that almost every meeting he had with the king, he had to listen to a lengthy litany of complaints. In particular, the king objected to BBC&#x27;s Greek language service, whose main radio announcer, G.N. Soteriadis, was a Venizelist. George repeatedly asked that Soteriadis be replaced with a monarchist. One of George&#x27;s few friends was Churchill, who was determined to see him restored and often backed the king&#x27;s complaints against his own officials.
In occupied Greece, however, the leftist partisans of the National Liberation Front (EAM) and National Popular Liberation Army (ELAS), now unfettered by Metaxas&#x27;s oppression, had become the largest Greek Resistance movement, enjoying considerable popular support. As liberation drew nearer however, the prospect of George&#x27;s return caused dissensions both inside Greece and among the Greeks abroad. Although he effectively renounced the Metaxas regime in a radio broadcast, a large section of the people and many politicians rejected his return on account of his support of the dictatorship. In November 1943, George wrote to Tsouderos, &quot;I shall examine anew the question of the date of my return to Greece in agreement with the Government&quot;. Either deliberately or accidentally, the version released for publication omitted the words &quot;of the date&quot;, creating the impression that George had agreed to a further plebiscite on the monarchy, even though a retraction was issued. After Italy joined the Allies on 8 September 1943, communists in Greece seized weapons of the Axis and gained territorial power within the country. There were growing calls for George to hold a referendum and appoint a regent before he returned to Greece. It was suggested that the regent be the Archbishop of Athens and All Greece, Archbishop Damaskinos, who was a strong supporter of republicanism, and thus George heavily opposed this. Communists became the monarchy&#x27;s main political opponent and a rival communist-led government, called the Political Committee of National Liberation, was established in occupied Greece and a pro-EAM mutiny, the 1944 Greek naval mutiny, among the armed forces in the Middle East, occurs. On 8 April 1944, Tsouderis resigned and George appointed the liberal Sophoklis Venizelos. However, when Venizelos is discovered to have been involved in the mutiny, George appoints Georgios Papandreou as prime minister and Papandreou selects a Cabinet made up of multiple republican ministers. It was agreed in the May 1944 Lebanon conference that the fate of the monarchy would be decided in a national referendum. George was very much opposed to a regency, and tried his best to turn Churchill against Archbishop Damaskinos, accusing him of being a communist and a Nazi collaborator.

Finally, Greece is liberated from the Axis. As late as Christmas Eve 1944, during the height of the &quot;Dekemvriana&quot;, George had rejected the compromise solution of a regency, demanding that he return to Greece at once to reclaim his throne. On 29 December 1944, at a meeting at 10 Downing Street, Churchill told the king &quot;that if he did not agree to the matter would be settled without him, and that we should recognise the new government instead of him&quot;. George&#x27;s private secretary recalled, &quot;I could hear through the door the voices of Churchill and Eden, particularly the latter, raised in anger at the king. In this heated argument the door was flung open and the king stormed out, his face white and taut ... In the car as we drove back to the hotel the King would not trust himself to speak; after recovering his composure he went back to Downing Street and informed Churchill and Eden that had no choice but to acquiesce to their demands&quot;. Bowing to pressure, George was forced to appoint Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens as regent in January 1945. Damaskinos immediately appointed a republican-dominated government. Ailing, exhausted and powerless, George bought a lease on a house in Chester Square, Belgravia, and made a home there with Wallach, his long-time mistress.

===Return to Greece ===

Though World War II was over, political instability in Greece remained very high. There was tension and violence between communists and British forces, commanded by General Ronald Scobie. On 31 March 1946, under the surveillance of the American, British and French governments, the 1946 Greek legislative election was held and the United Alignment of Nationalists, a royalist party, won a strong majority of seats, aided by the abstention of the communists, and the 1946 Greek referendum on the monarchy was set for 1 September. Between then and the referendum, the electoral registers were revised under Allied supervision. The announced results claimed 68.4% in favour of George&#x27;s return on an 86.6% turnout. However, even Allied observers acknowledged that the official results were marked by significant fraud by monarchist supporters. The official Allied observation report recorded, &quot;There is no doubt in our minds that the party representing the government view exercised undue influence in securing votes in support of the return of the King.&quot;

The new prime minister, Konstantinos Tsaldaris, went to London to invite George II back to Greece. On 27 September, George returned to Elefsina, Greece, and met with Paul and Frederica. From there, they and other members of the royal family travelled to Athens and were greeted by a large crowd and a &quot;Te Deum&quot;, celebrated by Damaskinos. Despite democracy being restored, the Greek population were still heavily suffering from the war. Van der Kiste estimates that 77% of the naval fleet was destroyed, 95% of railways destroyed and over 300 villages ransacked. George returned to find Tatoi Palace looted, the surrounding woods chopped down for fuel and corpses buried in shallow graves outside. His country also faced economic collapse.

With his residencies having been badly damaged, George moved into a cottage built for his father. His sister, Catherine, lived with him there as well with her staff. George attempted to depict his lifestyle as modest during a time of high rationing, and spent most of his time working in his office and opening letters addressed to him. While the Greek Civil War began raging in the north, the Paris Peace Treaties on 10 February 1947 allows Greece to annex the Dodecanese islands, which had been Italian territories since the Italo-Turkish War between 1911 and 1912. George proclaimed Admiral Perikles Ioannidis, the second husband of his aunt, Maria, as the first governor of the Dodecanese. George also aimed to annex Northern Epirus and a resolution vote by the American Senate approved this, but he was ultimately unsuccessful.

==Death==

From the announcement of Princess Katherine&#x27;s engagement to British Major Richard Brandram, George&#x27;s health began declining without his doctors being concerned. On 31 March 1947, George attended a performance of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; at the British embassy in Athens as part of a charity gala. At lunch the following day, George told a servant that he felt tired. He was then discovered unconscious in his office in the New Royal Palace in Athens on 1 April 1947. At 4:00 pm, George&#x27;s death was announced on the radio and his cause of death was given as arteriosclerosis. When the news was announced some thought it to be an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke. His funeral was held on 6 April at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens and he was buried at Tatoi Palace. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Paul. George&#x27;s nephew, Constantine, thus became the crown prince.

==In popular culture==
===War propaganda===
During World War II, the Allies used the figure of George II as an instrument of propaganda to reinforce Greek patriotic sentiment. Several short films centred on the sovereign and his government were thus shot, such as &quot;Heroic Greece!&quot; by the American Frank Norton (1941).

===Television and literature===
The romantic relationship of King George II and his mistress, nicknamed &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot;, is briefly mentioned in the third episode (&quot;The New King&quot;) of the British mini-series &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot;, which features the king&#x27;s cruise with Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson in the Greek Islands, in 1936. In addition, George is depicted in the English detective novel, &quot;A Royal Affair&quot; (1920), by Allisan Montclair.

===Music===
On the occasion of the restoration of George II as monarch in 1935, the &quot;rebetiko&quot; singer Markos Vamvakaris wrote a song titled &quot;We welcome you, King&quot; ().

===Philately===

Various stamps bearing the effigy of George II have been issued by Greek Post during his reign:
*A series of four stamps depicting the sovereign was thus issued, shortly after his restoration to the throne, on 1 November 1937, with face values of ₯1, ₯3, ₯8 and ₯100.
*A series of four stamps were issued in 1947 upon George&#x27;s return to Greece after World War II.
*A commemorative stamp depicting George above Crete was issued in 1950 &quot;in memoriam&quot; the Battle of Crete.
*Two stamps were released in 1956 and 1957 that showcased each Greek monarch.
*A series of five stamps were released in 1963 to mark the centenary of the Greek monarchy. Each Greek monarch was depicted.

===Numismatics===
Various Greek coins bearing the image of George II have been issued by the Bank of Greece. Among these are:
*A series of commemorative coins minted in 1940 to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the king&#x27;s restoration (₯20 and ₯100 coins struck in copper, silver and gold bearing the date of 25 November 1935).
*A ₯30 silver coin put into circulation in 1963 on the occasion of the centenary of the Greek monarchy and showing the portraits of kings George I, Constantine I, Alexander I and George II and Paul I.

He was commander-in-chief of the Hellenic Army during the unsuccessful Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and led the Greek forces during the successful Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, in which Greece expanded to include Thessaloniki, doubling in area and population. The eldest son of George I of Greece, he succeeded to the throne following his father&#x27;s assassination in 1913.

Constantine&#x27;s disagreement with Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos over whether Greece should enter World War I led to the National Schism. Under Allied duress, the country was essentially split between the pro-Venizelos North and the royalist South, ushering in a protracted civil war. He forced Venizelos to resign twice, but in 1917 Constantine left Greece, after threats by the Entente forces to bombard Athens; his second son, Alexander, became king. After Alexander&#x27;s death, Venizelos&#x27; defeat in the 1920 legislative elections, and a plebiscite in favor of his return, Constantine was reinstated. He abdicated the throne for the second and last time in 1922, when Greece lost the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, and this time was succeeded by his eldest son, George II. Constantine died on 11 January 1923 in exile in Sicily, Italy, from heart failure and brain haemorrhage.

==Early life==
Constantine was born on 2 August 1868 in Athens. He was the eldest son of King George I and Queen Olga. His birth was met with an immense wave of enthusiasm: the new heir apparent to the throne was the first Greek-born member of the family. As the ceremonial cannon on Lycabettus Hill fired the royal salute, huge crowds gathered outside the Palace shouting what they thought should rightfully be the newborn prince&#x27;s name: &quot;Constantine&quot;. This was both the name of his maternal grandfather, Grand Duke Konstantin Romanov of Russia, and the name of the &quot;King who would reconquer Constantinople&quot;, the future &quot;Constantine &quot;XII&quot;, legitimate successor to the Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos&quot;, according to popular legend. He was inevitably christened &quot;Constantine&quot; (, &quot;Kōnstantīnos&quot;) on 12 August, and his official style was the &quot;Diádochos&quot; (Διάδοχος, Crown Prince, literally: &quot;Successor&quot;). The most prominent university professors of the time were handpicked to tutor the young Crown Prince: Ioannis Pantazidis taught him Greek literature; Vasileios Lakonas mathematics and physics; and Constantine Paparrigopoulos history, infusing the young prince with the principles of the &quot;Megali Idea&quot;. On 30 October 1882 he enrolled in the Hellenic Military Academy. After graduation he was sent to Berlin for further military education, and served in the German Imperial Guard. Constantine also studied political science and business in Heidelberg and Leipzig. In 1890 he became a Major general, and assumed command of the 3rd Army Headquarters (Γʹ Αρχηγείον Στρατού) in Athens.

==Olympics and confrontations with Trikoupis==
In January 1895, Constantine caused political turmoil when he ordered army and gendarmerie forces to break up a street protest against tax policy. Constantine had previously addressed the crowd and advised them to submit their grievances to the government. Prime Minister Charilaos Trikoupis asked the King to recommend that his son avoid such interventions in politics without prior consultation with the government. King George responded that the Crown Prince was, in dispersing protesters, merely obeying military orders, and that his conduct lacked political significance. The incident caused a heated debate in Parliament, and Trikoupis finally resigned as a result. In the following elections Trikoupis was defeated, and the new prime minister, Theodoros Deligiannis, seeking to downplay hostility between government and the Palace, regarded the matter closed.

The organization of the first modern Olympics in Athens was another issue which caused a Constantine-Trikoupis confrontation, with Trikoupis opposed to hosting the Games. After Deligiannis&#x27;s electoral victory over Trikoupis in 1895, those who favored a revival of the Olympic Games, including the Crown Prince, prevailed. Subsequently, Constantine was instrumental in the organization of the 1896 Summer Olympics; according to Pierre de Coubertin, in 1894 &quot;the Crown Prince learned with great pleasure that the Games will be inaugurated in Athens.&quot; Coubertin assured that &quot;the King and the Crown Prince will confer their patronage on the holding of these Games.&quot; Constantine later conferred more than that; he eagerly assumed the presidency of the 1896 organizing committee. At the Crown Prince&#x27;s request, wealthy businessman George Averoff agreed to pay approximately one million drachmas to fund the restoration of the Panathinaiko Stadium in white marble.

==Greco-Turkish War and aftermath==
Constantine was the commander-in-chief of the Army of Thessaly in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, which ended in a humiliating defeat. In its aftermath, the popularity of the monarchy fell, and calls were raised in the army for reforms and the dismissal of the royal princes, and especially Constantine, from their command posts in the armed forces. The simmering dissent culminated in the Goudi coup in August 1909. In its aftermath, he and his brothers were dismissed from the armed forces, only to be reinstated a few months later by the new prime minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, who was keen on gaining the trust of King George. Venizelos was ingenious in his argumentation: &quot;All Greeks are rightly proud to see their sons serve in the army, and so is the King&quot;. What was left unsaid was that the royal princes&#x27; commands were to be on a very tight leash.

==Balkan Wars==
===Overview===

In 1912 with the formation of the Balkan League, Greece was ready for war against the Ottoman Empire and Prince Constantine became Chief of the Hellenic Army.

Ottoman planning anticipated a two-prong Greek attack east and west of the impassable Pindus mountain range. They accordingly allotted their resources, equally divided, in a defensive posture to fortify the approaches to Ioannina, capital of Epirus, and the mountain passes leading from Thessaly to Macedonia. This was a grave error. The war plan by Venizelos and the Greek General Staff called for a rapid advance with overwhelming force towards Thessaloniki with its important harbor. A small Greek force of little more than a division, just enough to forestall a possible Turkish redeployment eastwards, was to be sent west as the &quot;Army of Epirus&quot;.

At the same time the bulk of the Greek infantry and artillery made a rapid advance against the Turks in the east. In the event, the Greek plan worked well. Advancing on foot, the Greeks soundly defeated the Turks twice, and were in Thessaloniki within 4 weeks. The Greek plan for overwhelming attack and speedy advance hinged upon another factor: should the Hellenic Navy succeed in blockading the Turkish fleet within the Straits, any Turkish reinforcements from Asia would have no way of quickly reaching Europe. The Ottomans would be slow to mobilize, and even when the masses of troops raised in Asia were ready, they were able to go no further than the outskirts of Constantinople, fighting the Bulgarians in brutal trench warfare. With the Bulgarians directing the bulk of their force towards Constantinople, the capture of Thessaloniki would ensure that the railway axis between these two main cities was lost to the Turks, causing loss of logistics and supplies and severe impairment of command and control capability. The Turks would be hard placed to recruit locals, as their loyalties would be liable to lie with the Balkan Allies. Ottoman armies in Europe would be quickly cut off and their loss of morale and operational capability would lead them toward a quick surrender.

===Macedonian Front===
Previously the Inspector General of the Army, Constantine was appointed commander-in-chief of the &quot;Army of Thessaly&quot; when the First Balkan War broke out in October 1912. He led the Army of Thessaly to victory at Sarantaporos. At this point, his first clash with Venizelos occurred, as Constantine desired to press north, towards Monastir, where the bulk of the Ottoman army lay, and where the Greeks would rendezvous their Serb allies. Venizelos, on the other hand, demanded that the army capture the strategic port city of Thessaloniki, the capital of Macedonia, with extreme haste, so as to prevent its fall to the Bulgarians. The dispute resulted in a heated exchange of telegrams. Venizelos notified Constantine that &quot;... political considerations of the utmost importance dictate that Thessaloniki be taken as soon as possible&quot;. After Constantine impudently cabled: &quot;The army will not march on Thessaloniki. My duty calls me towards Monastir, unless you forbid me&quot;, Venizelos was forced to pull rank. As prime minister and war minister, he outranked Constantine and his response was famously three words long, a crisp military order to be obeyed forthwith: &quot;I forbid you&quot;. Constantine was left with no choice but to turn east, and after defeating the Ottoman army at Giannitsa, he accepted the surrender of the city of Thessaloniki and of its Ottoman garrison on 27 October (O.S.), less than 24 hours before the arrival of Bulgarian forces who hoped to capture the city first.

The capture of Thessaloniki against Constantine&#x27;s whim proved a crucial achievement: the pacts of the Balkan League had provided that in the forthcoming war against the Ottoman Empire, the four Balkan allies would provisionally hold any ground they took from the Turks, without contest from the other allies. Once an armistice was declared, then facts on the ground would be the starting point of negotiations for the final drawing of the new borders in a forthcoming peace treaty. With the vital port firmly in Greek hands, all the other allies could hope for was a customs-free dock in the harbor.

===Epirus Front===

In the meantime, operations in the Epirus front had stalled: against the rough terrain and Ottoman fortifications at Bizani, the small Greek force could not make any headway. With operations in Macedonia complete, Constantine transferred the bulk of his forces to Epirus, and assumed command. After lengthy preparations, the Greeks broke through the Ottoman defences in the Battle of Bizani and captured Ioannina and most of Epirus up into what is today southern Albania (Northern Epirus). These victories dispelled the tarnish of the 1897 defeat, and raised Constantine to great popularity with the Greek people.

===Accession to the Throne and Second Balkan War===
George I was assassinated in Thessaloniki by an anarchist, Alexandros Schinas, on 18 March 1913, and Constantine succeeded to the throne. In the meantime, tensions between the Balkan allies grew, as Bulgaria claimed Greek and Serbian-occupied territory. In May, Greece and Serbia concluded a secret defensive pact aimed at Bulgaria. On 16 June, the Bulgarian army attacked their erstwhile allies, but were soon halted. King Constantine led the Greek Army in its counterattack in the battles of Kilkis-Lahanas and the Kresna Gorge. In the meantime the Bulgarian army had started to disintegrate: beset by defeat in the hands of Greeks and Serbs, they were suddenly faced by a Turkish counterattack with fresh Asian troops finally ready, while the Romanians advanced south, demanding Southern Dobrudja. Under attack on four fronts Bulgaria sued for peace, agreed to an armistice and entered into negotiations in Bucharest. On the initiative of Prime Minister Venizelos, Constantine was also awarded the rank and baton of a Field Marshal. His popularity was at its peak. He was the &quot;winner over the Bulgarians&quot;, the King who under his military commandment, doubled the Greek territory.

==World War I and the National Schism==
===Overview===
The widely held view of Constantine I as a &quot;German sympathizer&quot; owes something to his marriage with Sophia of Prussia, sister of Wilhelm II, to his studies in Germany and his supposed &quot;militaristic&quot; beliefs and attitude.

Constantine did rebuff Kaiser Wilhelm who in 1914 pressed him to bring Greece into the war on the side of Austria-Hungary and Germany. In their correspondence he told him that his sympathy was with Germany, but he would not join the war. Constantine then offended also the British and French by blocking popular efforts by Prime Minister Venizelos to bring Greece into the war on the side of the Allies.

Constantine&#x27;s insistence on neutrality, according to him and his supporters, was based more on his judgement that it was the best policy for Greece, rather than venal self-interest or his German dynastic connections, as he was accused of by the Venizelists.

Admiral Mark Kerr, who was Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Hellenic Navy in the early part of World War I and later Commander-in-Chief of the British Adriatic Squadron, supported the Allied cause, but was sympathetic to the King, personally. He wrote in 1920:

&quot;The persecution of King Constantine by the press of the Allied countries, with some few good exceptions, has been one of the most tragic affairs since the Dreyfus case.&quot; [Abbott, G.F. (1922) &#x27;Greece and the Allies 1914–1922&#x27;]

Although Venizelos, with Allied support, forced Constantine to leave the throne in 1917, he remained popular with parts of the Greek people (as shown by the vote for his return in the December 1920 plebiscite), who saw the Allied actions as a violation of sovereignty of Greece.

===Events===
In the aftermath of the victorious Balkan Wars, Greece was in a state of euphoria. Her territory and population had doubled with the massive liberation of Greeks from Ottoman rule and, under the dual leadership of Constantine and Venizelos, her future seemed bright. However Constantine had been ill with pleurisy since the Balkan wars and almost died during the summer of 1915.

This state of affairs was not to last, however. When World War I broke out, a dispute appeared between the king and the government about the responsibility for the external policy of the state in case of war.

Constantine was faced with the difficulty of determining where Greece&#x27;s support lay. His first concern as King was for the welfare and security of Greece. He rejected the early appeal from Kaiser Wilhelm that Greece should march on the side of Germany and stated that Greece would remain neutral. Sophie, Constantine&#x27;s queen, was popularly thought to support her brother Kaiser Wilhelm, but it seems that she was actually pro-British; like her father the late Kaiser Frederick, Sophie was influenced by her mother, the British-born Victoria. Venizelos was fervently pro-Entente, having established excellent rapport with the British and French, and was convinced that German aggression had caused the war and that the Allies would quickly win the war.

Both Venizelos and Constantine were keenly aware that a maritime country like Greece could not, and should not, antagonise the Entente, the dominant naval powers in the Mediterranean. Constantine settled on a policy of neutrality because it seemed the path that best assured that Greece would emerge from the World War intact and with the substantial territorial gains it had won in the recent Balkan Wars.

In January 1915, the Entente made proposals to both Bulgaria and Greece to side with it. Bulgaria would take eastern Macedonia from Greece (with Drama and Kavala), while Greece in exchange would gain land in Asia Minor from Turkey after the war. Venizelos agreed but Constantine rejected the proposal.

Constantine claimed his military judgement was right, after the outcome of the Allies&#x27; failed operation of landing on Gallipoli. Despite the popularity of Venizelos and his clear majority in Parliament for supporting the Allies, Constantine opposed Venizelos. Venizelos actually wanted Greece to participate at the Gallipoli operation, but after military objections by the General Staff (Ioannis Metaxas), the King rejected the idea.

In autumn 1915, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers and attacked Serbia, with which Greece had a treaty of alliance. Venizelos again urged the King to allow Greece&#x27;s entry into the war. The Hellenic army was mobilized for defensive reasons, but Constantine claimed that the treaty had no value in case of a global war, but only of Balkan issues. Furthermore, he supported that according to the treaty, Serbia should mobilize 150,000 soldiers against Bulgaria, something that it could not do at that time.

The British then offered Cyprus to the Greek Kingdom to join the war, but Constantine rejected this offer as well. Venizelos permitted Entente forces to disembark in Thessaloniki (establishing so the Macedonian front) in aid of Serbia and in preparation for a common campaign over the King&#x27;s objections. This action of Venizelos, which violated the country&#x27;s neutrality, enraged the King who dismissed him for second time.

At the same time, Germany offered the protection and security of the Greek population of Turkey during and after the war, in exchange for Greece to remain neutral. Constantine was accused also by his Venizelist opponents for secret discussions and correspondence with the Central Powers.

In March 1916, in an effort to increase his prestige, Constantine declared the official annexation of Northern Epirus, which was controlled by the Greeks since 1914, but the Greek forces were driven from the area by the Italians and French during the next year.

In June 1916, Constantine, General Metaxas (the future dictator) and Prime Minister Skouloudis allowed Fort Rupel and parts of eastern Macedonia to be occupied, without opposition, by the Germans and Bulgarians, as a counterbalance to the Allied forces in Thessaloniki. This caused popular anger, especially in Greek Macedonia which now was facing the Bulgarian danger. The leadership of the Allied armies in Thessaloniki was worried also about a possible attack by the army of Constantine in their back.

In July 1916, arsonists set fire to the forest surrounding the summer palace at Tatoi. Although injured in the escape, the king and his family managed to flee to safety. The flames spread quickly in the dry summer heat, and sixteen people were killed. Royal rumors connected the incident with actions by French agents, especially De Roquefeuil, who was in Athens since 1915, but it was never proven. A hunting of Venizelists followed in Athens.

In August 1916, a military coup broke out in Thessaloniki by Venizelist officers. There, Venizelos established a provisional revolutionary government, which created its own army and declared war on the Central Powers. With Allied support, the revolutionary government of Venizelos gained control of half the country – significantly, most of the &quot;New Lands&quot; won during the Balkan Wars. This cemented the &quot;National Schism&quot;, a division of Greek society between Venizelists and anti-Venizelist monarchists, which was to have repercussions in Greek politics until past World War II. Venizelos made a public call to the King to dismiss his &quot;bad advisors&quot;, to join the war as King of all Greeks and stop being a politician. The royal governments of Constantine in Athens continued to negotiate with the Allies a possible entry in the war.

During November/December 1916, the British and French landed units at Athens claiming the surrender of war materiel equivalent to what was lost at Fort Rupel as a guarantee of Greece&#x27;s neutrality. After days of tension, finally they met resistance by paramilitary (Epistratoi) and pro-royalist forces (during the Noemvriana events), that were commanded by officers Metaxas and Dousmanis. After an armed confrontation, the Allies evacuated the capital and recognized officially the government of Venizelos in Thessaloniki. Constantine so became the most hated person for the Allies after his best man Kaiser Wilhelm.

Early in 1917, the Venizelist Government of National Defence (based in Thessaloniki) took control of Thessaly.

After the fall of the monarchy in Russia, Constantine lost his last supporter inside the Entente opposed to his removal from the throne. In the face of Venizelist and Anglo-French pressure, King Constantine finally left the country for Switzerland on 11 June 1917; his second-born son Alexander became king in his place. The Allied Powers were opposed to Constantine&#x27;s first born son George becoming king, as he had served in the German army before the war and like his father was thought to be a Germanophile.

==Restoration and Asia Minor Catastrophe==
King Alexander died on 25 October 1920, after a freak accident: he was strolling with his dogs in the royal menagerie, when they attacked a monkey. Rushing to save the poor animal, the king was bitten by the monkey. What seemed like a minor injury turned to sepsis, and he died a few days later. The following month Venizelos suffered a surprising defeat in a general election.

Greece had at this point been at war for eight continuous years: World War I had come and gone, but yet no sign of an enduring peace was near, as the country was already at war against the Kemalist forces in Asia Minor. Young men had been fighting and dying for years, lands lay fallow for lack of hands to cultivate them, and the country, morally exhausted, was at the brink of economic and political unravelling.

The pro-royalist parties had promised peace and prosperity under the victorious Field Marshal of the Balkan Wars, he who knew of the soldier&#x27;s plight because he had fought next to him and shared his ration.

Following a plebiscite in which nearly 99% of votes were cast in favor of his return, Constantine returned as king on 19 December 1920. This caused great dissatisfaction not only to the newly liberated populations in Asia Minor, but also to the British and even more the French, who opposed the return of Constantine.

The new government decided to continue the war. The inherited, ongoing campaign began with initial successes in western Anatolia against the Turks. The Greeks initially met with disorganized opposition.

In March 1921, despite his health problems, Constantine was landed in Anatolia to boost the Army&#x27;s morale and command personally the Battle of Kütahya-Eskişehir.

However, an ill-conceived plan to capture Kemal&#x27;s new capital of Ankara, located deep in barren Anatolia, where there was no significant Greek population, succeeded only in its initial stages. The overextended and ill-supplied Greek Army was routed and driven from Anatolia back to the coast in August 1922. Following an army revolt by Venizelist officers, considering him as key responsible for the defeat, Constantine abdicated the throne again on 27 September 1922 and was succeeded by his eldest son, George II.

==Second exile and death==
He spent the last four months of his life in exile in Italy and died at 1:30 am on 11 January 1923 at Palermo, Sicily of heart failure. His wife, Sophie of Prussia, was never allowed back to Greece and was later interred beside her husband in the Russian Church in Florence.

After his restoration on the Greek throne, George II organized the repatriation of the remains of members of his family who died in exile. An important religious ceremony that brought together, for six days in November 1936, all members of the royal family still alive. Constantine&#x27;s body was buried at the royal burial ground at Tatoi Palace, where he remains.

==Marriage and issue==

As Crown Prince of Greece, Constantine married Princess Sophia of Prussia, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria and sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II, on 27 October 1889 in Athens. They had six children. All three of their sons ascended the Greek throne. Their eldest daughter Helen married Crown Prince Carol of Romania; their second daughter married the 4th Duke of Aosta; while their youngest child, Princess Katherine, married a British commoner.

==Legacy and popular culture==
Constantine remained an idol for his supporters (much like Venizelos for his own supporters), and generally for the conservative Right, for years after his death. However, nowadays the legacy of Venizelos is more appreciated.

In the popular culture, the slogan of the royalists &quot;psomí, elia ke Kotso Vasiliá&quot; (&quot;bread, olives and King Constantine&quot;) still survives. It was a popular phrase during the naval blockade of southern Greece by the Allied fleet (1916/17), which caused hunger to the population.

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
===Titles and styles===
From birth, Constantine was styled &quot;His Royal Highness The Crown Prince (&quot;Diadochos&quot;) of Greece&quot; until his accession to the throne. On the day of his baptism, his father issued a royal decree granting him the additional title of Duke of Sparta; however, this title was used only outside of Greece.

He is sometimes numbered Constantine XII in succession to Constantine XI Palaiologos.

<text>Alexander (, : &quot;Aléxandros&quot;; 1 August 189325 October 1920) was King of Greece from 11 June 1917 until his death on 25 October 1920.

The second son of King Constantine I, Alexander was born in the summer palace of Tatoi on the outskirts of Athens. He succeeded his father in 1917, during World War I, after the Entente Powers and the followers of Eleftherios Venizelos pushed King Constantine and his eldest son, Crown Prince George, into exile. Having no real political experience, the new king was stripped of his powers by the Venizelists and effectively imprisoned in his own palace. Venizelos, as prime minister, was the effective ruler with the support of the Entente. Though reduced to the status of a puppet king, Alexander supported Greek troops during their war against the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. Under his reign, the territorial extent of Greece considerably increased, following the victory of the Entente and their Allies in the First World War and the early stages of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922.

Alexander controversially married the commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced the couple to leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic Barbary macaque and died aged 27 of sepsis. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy&#x27;s survival and contributed to the fall of the Venizelist regime. After a general election and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.

==Early life==

Alexander was born at Tatoi Palace on 1 August 1893 (20 July in the Julian calendar), the second son of Crown Prince Constantine of Greece and Princess Sophia of Prussia. He was related to royalty throughout Europe. His father was the eldest son of King George I of Greece by his wife, Olga Constantinovna of Russia; his mother was the daughter of Frederick III, German Emperor, and Victoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom. His parents&#x27; cousins included King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Wilhelm II, German Emperor, was his maternal uncle.

Alexander&#x27;s early life alternated between the Royal Palace in Athens, and Tatoi Palace in the city&#x27;s suburbs. With his parents he undertook several trips abroad and regularly visited Schloss Friedrichshof, the home of his maternal grandmother, who had a particular affection for her Greek grandson.

Though he was very close to his younger sister Helen, Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother, George, with whom he had little in common. While George was a serious and thoughtful child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked cigarettes made from blotting paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and recklessly lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother Paul were rolling down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of into brambles.

==Military career==
Alexander was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother. His education was expensive and carefully planned, but while George spent part of his military training in Germany, Alexander was educated in Greece. He joined the prestigious Hellenic Military Academy, where several of his uncles had previously studied and where he made himself known more for his mechanical skills than for his intellectual capacity. He was passionate about cars and motors, and was one of the first Greeks to acquire an automobile.

Alexander distinguished himself in combat during the Balkan Wars of 1912–13. As a young officer, he was stationed, along with his elder brother, in the field staff of his father; and he accompanied the latter at the head of the Army of Thessaly during the capture of Thessaloniki in 1912. King George I was assassinated in Thessaloniki soon afterwards on 18 March 1913, and Alexander&#x27;s father ascended the throne as Constantine I.

===Courtship of Aspasia Manos===
In 1915, at a party held in Athens by court marshal Theodore Ypsilantis, Alexander became re-acquainted with one of his childhood friends, Aspasia Manos. She had just returned from education in France and Switzerland, and was reckoned as very beautiful by her acquaintances.

She was the daughter of Constantine&#x27;s Master of the Horse, Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten, and was so determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of Spetses where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies&#x27; man from numerous past liaisons.

Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.

===World War I===

During World War I, Constantine I followed a formal policy of neutrality, yet he was openly benevolent towards Germany, which was fighting alongside Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire against the Triple Entente of Russia, France and Britain. Constantine was the brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and had also become something of a Germanophile following his military training in Prussia. His pro-German attitude provoked a split between the monarch and the prime minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, who wanted to support the Entente in the hope of expanding Greek territory to incorporate the Greek minorities in the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans. Protected by the countries of the Entente, particularly France, in 1916 Venizelos formed a parallel government to that of the king.

Parts of Greece were occupied by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify his policy and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the Venizelists. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured but his mother narrowly saved Princess Katherine by carrying her through the woods for more than . Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived to deal with the blaze, sixteen people were killed.

Finally on 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, the Entente&#x27;s High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine to give up his power. On the threat of Entente forces landing in Piraeus, the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while determined to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father. Instead, they considered installing Constantine&#x27;s brother (and Alexander&#x27;s uncle), Prince George, but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of Crete between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne. As a result, Constantine&#x27;s second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.

==Reign==

===Accession===
The dismissal of Constantine was not unanimously supported by the Entente powers; while France and Britain did nothing to stop Jonnart&#x27;s actions, the Russian provisional government officially protested to Paris. Petrograd demanded that Alexander should not receive the title of king but only that of regent, so as to preserve the rights of the deposed sovereign and the Crown Prince. Russia&#x27;s protests were brushed aside, and Alexander ascended the Greek throne.

Alexander swore the oath of loyalty to the Greek constitution on the afternoon of 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king&#x27;s prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.

In the evening, after the ceremony, the royal family decided to leave their palace in Athens for Tatoi, but city residents opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another. At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only. It was the last time that Alexander would be in direct contact with his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of Oropos and set off into exile.

===Puppet king===
With his parents and siblings in exile, Alexander found himself isolated. The royals remained unpopular with the Venizelists, and Entente representatives advised the king&#x27;s aunts and uncles, particularly Prince Nicholas, to leave. Eventually, they all followed Constantine into exile. Royal household staff were gradually replaced by enemies of the former king, and Alexander&#x27;s allies were either imprisoned or distanced from him. Portraits of the royal family were removed from public buildings, and Alexander&#x27;s new ministers openly called him the &quot;son of a traitor&quot;.

On 26 June 1917, the king was forced to name Eleftherios Venizelos as head of the government. Despite promises given by the Entente on Constantine&#x27;s departure, the previous prime minister, Zaimis, was effectively forced to resign as Venizelos returned to Athens. Alexander immediately opposed his new prime minister&#x27;s views and, annoyed by the king&#x27;s rebuffs, Venizelos threatened to remove him and set up a regency council in the name of Alexander&#x27;s brother Prince Paul, then still a minor. The Entente powers intervened and asked Venizelos to back down, allowing Alexander to retain the crown. Spied on day and night by the prime minister&#x27;s supporters, the monarch quickly became a prisoner in his own palace, and his orders went ignored.

Alexander had no experience in affairs of state. However, he was determined to make the best of a difficult situation and to represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos&#x27;s return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.

===Greek expansion===
By the end of World War I, Greece had grown beyond its 1914 borders, and the treaties of Neuilly (1919) and Sèvres (1920) confirmed the Greek territorial conquests. The majority of Thrace (previously split between Bulgaria and Turkey) and several Aegean Islands (such as Imbros and Tenedos) became part of Greece, and the region of Smyrna, in Ionia, was placed under Greek mandate. Alexander&#x27;s kingdom increased in size by around a third. In Paris, Venizelos took part in the peace negotiations with the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. Upon his return to Greece in August 1920, Venizelos received a laurel crown from the king for his work in support of panhellenism.

Despite their territorial gains following the Paris Peace Conference, the Greeks still hoped to achieve the &quot;Megali Idea&quot; and annex Constantinople and larger areas of Ottoman Asia Minor; they invaded Anatolia beyond Smyrna and sought to take Ankara, with the aim of destroying the Turkish resistance led by Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk). Thus began the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). Although Alexander&#x27;s reign saw success after success for the Greek armies, it was eventually Atatürk&#x27;s revolutionary forces that obtained victory in 1922, negating the gains made under Alexander.

==Marriage==
===Controversy===
On 12 June 1917, the day after his accession, Alexander revealed his liaison with Aspasia Manos to his father and asked for his permission to marry her. Constantine was reluctant to let his son marry a non-royal, and demanded that Alexander wait until the end of the war before considering the engagement, to which Alexander agreed. In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated. Alexander&#x27;s only source of comfort was Aspasia, and he decided to marry her despite his father&#x27;s request.
The ruling dynasty of Greece (the House of Glücksburg) was of German-Danish origin, and Constantine and Sophia were seen as far too German by the Venizelists, but even though the marriage of the king to a Greek presented an opportunity to Hellenize the royal family, and counter criticisms that it was a foreign institution, both Venizelists and Constantinists opposed the match. The Venizelists feared it would give Alexander a means to communicate with his exiled family through Colonel Manos and both sides of the political divide were unhappy at the king marrying a commoner. Although Venizelos was a friend of Petros Manos, the prime minister warned the king that marrying her would be unpopular in the eyes of the people.

When Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, visited Athens in March 1918, to confer the Order of the Bath upon the king, Alexander feared that a marriage between him and Princess Mary of the United Kingdom would be discussed as part of an attempt to consolidate the relationship between Greece and Britain. To Alexander&#x27;s relief, Arthur asked to meet Aspasia, and declared that, if he were younger, he would have sought to marry her himself. For the foreign powers, and particularly the British ambassador, the marriage was seen as positive. The British authorities feared that Alexander would abdicate in order to marry Aspasia if the wedding was blocked, and they wanted to avoid Greece becoming a republic in case it led to instability or an increase in French influence at their expense.

Alexander&#x27;s parents were not so happy about the match. Sophia disapproved of her son marrying a commoner, while Constantine wanted a delay but was prepared to be his son&#x27;s best man if Alexander would be patient. Alexander visited Paris at the end of 1918, raising hopes among his family that they would be able to contact him once he was outside Greece. When Queen Sophia attempted to telephone her son in his Parisian hotel, a minister intercepted the call and informed her that &quot;His Majesty is sorry, but he cannot respond to the telephone&quot;. He was not even informed that she had called.

===Public scandal===

With the help of Aspasia&#x27;s brother-in-law, Christo Zalocostas, and after three unsuccessful attempts, the couple eventually married in secret before a royal chaplain, Archimandrite Zacharistas, on the evening of 17 November 1919. After the ceremony, the archimandrite was sworn to silence but soon broke his promise by confessing to the Archbishop of Athens, Meletios Metaxakis. According to the Greek constitution, members of the royal family had to obtain permission to marry from both the sovereign and the head of the Greek Orthodox Church. By marrying Aspasia without the permission of the Archbishop, Alexander caused a major scandal.

Despite his disapproval of the union, Venizelos allowed Aspasia and her mother to move into the Royal Palace on condition that the marriage remain secret. The information leaked, however, and to escape public opprobrium Aspasia was forced to leave Greece. She fled to Rome, and then to Paris, where Alexander was allowed to join her, six months later, on condition that they not attend official functions together. On their Parisian honeymoon, while motoring near Fontainebleau, the couple witnessed a serious car crash in which Count de Kergariou&#x27;s chauffeur lost control of his master&#x27;s vehicle. Alexander avoided the count&#x27;s car, which swerved and hit a tree. The king drove the injured to hospital in his own car, while Aspasia, who had trained as a nurse during World War I, rendered first aid. The count was seriously injured and died shortly afterward, after having both legs amputated.

The government allowed the couple to return to Greece in mid-1920. Although their marriage was legalized, Aspasia was not recognized as queen, but was instead known as &quot;Madame Manos&quot;. At first, she stayed at her sister&#x27;s house in the Greek capital before transferring to Tatoi, and it was during this period that she became pregnant with Alexander&#x27;s child.

Alexander visited the newly acquired territories of West Thrace, and on 8 July 1920 the new name for the region&#x27;s main town—Alexandroupolis (meaning &quot;city of Alexander&quot; in Greek)—was announced in the king&#x27;s presence. The city&#x27;s previous name of Dedeagatch was considered too Turkish. On 7 September, Venizelos, counting on a surge of support in the wake of the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres and the expansion of Greek territory, announced a general election for early November.

==Death==

On 2 October 1920, Alexander was injured while walking through the grounds of the Tatoi estate. A domestic Barbary macaque belonging to the steward of the palace&#x27;s grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king&#x27;s German Shepherd dog, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys, and the king&#x27;s wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.

That evening, his wounds became infected; he developed a strong fever and sepsis set in. His doctors considered amputating his leg, but none wished to take responsibility for so drastic an act. On 19 October, he became delirious and called out for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in Switzerland, despite her own protestations. Finally, the queen dowager, Olga, George I&#x27;s widow and Alexander&#x27;s grandmother, was allowed to return alone to Athens to tend to the king. She was delayed by rough waters, however, and by the time she arrived, Alexander had already died of sepsis twelve hours previously at a little after 4 p.m. on 25 October 1920. The other members of the royal family received the news by telegram that night.

Two days later, Alexander&#x27;s body was conveyed to Athens Cathedral, where it lay in state until his funeral on 29 October. Once again, the royal family were refused permission to return to Greece, and Queen Olga was the only member who attended. Foreign powers were represented by the Prince Regent of Serbia with his sister Princess Helen wife of John Constantinovich of Russia, the Crown Prince of Sweden with his uncle Prince Eugene, Duke of Nericia, and Rear-Admirals Sir George Hope of the United Kingdom and Dumesnil of France, as well as members of the Athens diplomatic corps.

After the cathedral service, Alexander&#x27;s body was interred on the grounds of the royal estate at Tatoi. The Greek royal family never regarded Alexander&#x27;s reign as fully legitimate. In the royal cemetery, while other monarchs are given the inscription &quot;King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark&quot;, Alexander&#x27;s reads &quot;Alexander, son of the King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark. He ruled in the place of his father from 14 June 1917 to 25 October 1920.&quot; According to Alexander&#x27;s favorite sister, Queen Helen of Romania, this feeling of illegitimacy was also shared by Alexander himself, a sentiment that helps explain his mésalliance with Aspasia Manos.

==Legacy==

Alexander&#x27;s death raised questions about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage, his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting under the direction of the Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander&#x27;s younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.

The throne remained vacant and the legislative elections of 1920 turned into an open conflict between the Venizelists, who favored republicanism, and the supporters of the ex-King Constantine. On 14 November 1920, with the war with Turkey dragging on, the monarchists won, and Dimitrios Rallis became prime minister; Venizelos (who lost his own parliamentary seat) chose to leave Greece in self-exile. Rallis asked Queen Olga to become regent until Constantine&#x27;s return.

Under the restored King Constantine I, whose return was endorsed overwhelmingly in a referendum, Greece went on to lose the Greco–Turkish War with heavy military and civilian casualties. The territory gained on the Turkish mainland during Alexander&#x27;s reign was lost. Alexander&#x27;s death in the midst of an election campaign helped destabilize the Venizelos regime, and the resultant loss of Allied support contributed to the failure of Greece&#x27;s territorial ambitions. Winston Churchill wrote, &quot;it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this monkey&#x27;s bite.&quot;

===Issue===
Alexander&#x27;s daughter by Aspasia Manos, Alexandra (1921–1993), was born five months after his death. Initially, the government took the line that since Alexander had married Aspasia without the permission of his father or the church, his marriage was illegal and his posthumous daughter was illegitimate. However, in July 1922, Parliament passed a law which allowed the King to recognize royal marriages retroactively on a non-dynastic basis. That September, Constantine—at Sophia&#x27;s insistence—recognized his son&#x27;s marriage to Aspasia and granted her the style of &quot;Princess Alexander&quot;. Her daughter (Constantine I&#x27;s granddaughter) was legitimized as a princess of Greece and Denmark, and later married King Peter II of Yugoslavia in London in 1944. They had one child: Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia.

<doc id="160216" wikidata="Q1356939" url="?curid=160216" title="RC6">
<text>In cryptography, RC6 (Rivest cipher 6) is a symmetric key block cipher derived from RC5. It was designed by Ron Rivest, Matt Robshaw, Ray Sidney, and Yiqun Lisa Yin to meet the requirements of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. The algorithm was one of the five finalists, and also was submitted to the NESSIE and CRYPTREC projects. It was a proprietary algorithm, patented by RSA Security.

RC6 proper has a block size of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits up to 2040-bits, but, like RC5, it may be parameterised to support a wide variety of word-lengths, key sizes, and number of rounds. RC6 is very similar to RC5 in structure, using data-dependent rotations, modular addition, and XOR operations; in fact, RC6 could be viewed as interweaving two parallel RC5 encryption processes, although RC6 does use an extra multiplication operation not present in RC5 in order to make the rotation dependent on every bit in a word, and not just the least significant few bits.

==Encryption/decryption==
Note that the key expansion algorithm is practically identical to that of RC5. The only difference is that for RC6, more words are derived from the user-supplied key.

// Encryption/Decryption with RC6-w/r/b
// Input: Plaintext stored in four w-bit input registers A, B, C &amp; D
// r is the number of rounds
// w-bit round keys S[0, ... , 2r + 3]
// Output: Ciphertext stored in A, B, C, D
// Encryption Procedure:

 B = B + S[0]
 D = D + S[1]
 for i = 1 to r do
 t = (B * (2B + 1)) «&lt; lg w
 u = (D * (2D + 1)) «&lt; lg w
 A = ((A ^ t) «&lt; u) + S[2i]
 C = ((C ^ u) «&lt; t) + S[2i + 1] 
 (A, B, C, D) = (B, C, D, A)
 A = A + S[2r + 2]
 C = C + S[2r + 3]

// Decryption Procedure:

 C = C - S[2r + 3]
 A = A - S[2r + 2]
 for i = r downto 1 do
 (A, B, C, D) = (D, A, B, C)
 u = (D * (2D + 1)) «&lt; lg w
 t = (B * (2B + 1)) «&lt; lg w
 C = ((C - S[2i + 1]) »&gt; t) ^ u
 A = ((A - S[2i]) »&gt; u) ^ t
 D = D - S[1]
 B = B - S[0]
==Possible use in NSA &quot;implants&quot;==
In August 2016, code reputed to be Equation Group or NSA &quot;implants&quot; for various network security devices was disclosed. The accompanying instructions revealed that some of these programs use RC6 for confidentiality of network communications.

==Licensing==
As RC6 was not selected for the AES, it was not guaranteed that RC6 is royalty-free. , a web page on the official web site of the designers of RC6, RSA Laboratories, states the following:

:&quot;We emphasize that &quot;if&quot; RC6 is selected for the AES, RSA Security will &quot;not&quot; require any licensing or royalty payments for products using the algorithm&quot;.

The emphasis on the word &quot;if&quot; suggests that RSA Security Inc. may have required licensing and royalty payments for any products using the RC6 algorithm. RC6 was a patented encryption algorithm ( and ); however, the patents expired between 2015 and 2017.

<text>Ratites () are a polyphyletic group consisting of all birds within the infraclass Palaeognathae that lack keels and cannot fly. They are mostly large, long-necked, and long-legged, the exception being the kiwi, which is also the only nocturnal extant ratite.

The understanding of relationships within the paleognath clade has been in flux. Previously, all the flightless members had been assigned to the order Struthioniformes, which is more recently regarded as containing only the ostrich. The modern bird superorder Palaeognathae consists of ratites and the flighted Neotropic tinamous (compare to Neognathae). Unlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no keel on their sternum—hence the name, from the Latin (&#x27;raft&#x27;, a vessel which has no keel—in contradistinction to extant flighted birds with a keel). Without this to anchor their wing muscles, they could not have flown even if they had developed suitable wings. Ratites are a polyphyletic group; tinamous fall within them, and are the sister group of the extinct moa. This implies that flightlessness is a trait that evolved independently multiple times in different ratite lineages.

Most parts of the former supercontinent Gondwana have ratites, or did have until the fairly recent past. So did Europe in the Paleocene and Eocene, from where the first flightless paleognaths are known. Ostriches were present in Asia as recently as the Holocene, although the genus is thought to have originated in Africa. However, the ostrich order may have evolved in Eurasia. A recent study posits a Laurasian origin for the clade. Geranoidids, which may have been ratites, existed in North America.

== Species ==
=== Living forms ===
The African ostrich is the largest living ratite. A large member of this species can be nearly tall, weigh as much as , and can outrun a horse.

Of the living species, the Australian emu is next in height, reaching up to tall and about . Like the ostrich, it is a fast-running, powerful bird of the open plains and woodlands.

Also native to Australia and the islands to the north are the three species of cassowary. Shorter than an emu, but heavier and solidly built, cassowaries prefer thickly vegetated tropical forest. They can be dangerous when surprised or cornered because of their razor-sharp talons. In New Guinea, cassowary eggs are brought back to villages and the chicks raised for eating as a much-prized delicacy, despite (or perhaps because of) the risk they pose to life and limb. They reach up to tall and weigh as much as 

South America has two species of rhea, large fast-running birds of the Pampas. The larger American rhea grows to about tall and usually weighs .

The smallest ratites are the five species of kiwi from New Zealand. Kiwi are chicken-sized, shy, and nocturnal. They nest in deep burrows and use a highly developed sense of smell to find small insects and grubs in the soil. Kiwi are notable for laying eggs that are very large in relation to their body size. A kiwi egg may equal 15 to 20 percent of the body mass of a female kiwi. The smallest species of kiwi is the little spotted kiwi, at and .

=== Holocene extinct forms ===
At least nine species of moa lived in New Zealand before the arrival of humans, ranging from turkey-sized to the giant moa &quot;Dinornis robustus&quot; with a height of and weighing about . They became extinct by A.D. 1400 due to hunting by Māori settlers, who arrived around A.D. 1280.

&quot;Aepyornis maximus&quot;, the &quot;elephant bird&quot; of Madagascar, was the heaviest bird ever known. Although shorter than the tallest moa, a large &quot;A. maximus&quot; could weigh over and stand up to tall. Accompanying it were three other species of &quot;Aepyornis&quot; as well as three species of the smaller genus &quot;Mullerornis&quot;. All these species went into decline following the arrival of humans on Madagascar around 2,000 years ago, and were gone by the 17th or 18th century if not earlier.

== Classification ==
There are two taxonomic approaches to ratite classification: one combines the groups as families in the order Struthioniformes, while the other supposes that the lineages evolved mostly independently and thus elevates the families to order rank (Rheiformes, Casuariformes etc.).

== Evolution ==

The longstanding story of ratite evolution was that they share a common flightless ancestor that lived in Gondwana, whose descendants were isolated from each other by continental drift, which carried them to their present locations. Supporting this idea, some studies based on morphology, immunology and DNA sequencing reported that ratites are monophyletic. Cracraft&#x27;s 1974 biogeographic vicariance hypothesis suggested that ancestral flightless paleognaths, the ancestors of ratites, were present and widespread in Gondwana during the Late Cretaceous. As the supercontinent fragmented due to plate tectonics, they were carried by plate movements to their current positions and evolved into the species present today. The earliest known ratite fossils date to the Paleocene epoch about 56 million years ago (e.g., &quot;Diogenornis&quot;, a possible early relative of the rhea). However, more primitive paleognaths are known from several million years earlier, and the classification and membership of the Ratitae itself is uncertain. Some of the earliest ratites occur in Europe.

Recent analyses of genetic variation between the ratites do not support this simple picture. The ratites may have diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanan ancestor. Also, the Middle Eocene ratites such as &quot;Palaeotis&quot; and &quot;Remiornis&quot; from Central Europe may imply that the &quot;out-of-Gondwana&quot; hypothesis is oversimplified.

Molecular phylogenies of the ratites have generally placed ostriches in the basal position and among extant ratites, placed rheas in the second most basal position, with Australo-Pacific ratites splitting up last; they have also shown that both the latter groups are monophyletic. Early mitochondrial genetic studies that failed to make ostriches basal were apparently compromised by the combination of rapid early radiation of the group and long terminal branches. A morphological analysis that created a basal New Zealand clade has not been corroborated by molecular studies. A 2008 study of nuclear genes shows ostriches branching first, followed by rheas and tinamous, then kiwi splitting from emus and cassowaries. In more recent studies, moas and tinamous were shown to be sister groups, and elephant birds were shown to be most closely related to the New Zealand kiwi. Additional support for the latter relationship was obtained from morphological analysis.

The finding that tinamous nest within this group, originally based on twenty nuclear genes and corroborated by a study using forty novel nuclear loci makes &#x27;ratites&#x27; polyphyletic rather than monophyletic, if we exclude the tinamous. Since tinamous are weak fliers, this raises interesting questions about the evolution of flightlessness in this group. The branching of the tinamous within the ratite radiation suggests flightlessness evolved independently among ratites at least three times. More recent evidence suggests this happened at least six times, or once in each major ratite lineage. Re-evolution of flight in the tinamous would be an alternative explanation, but such a development is without precedent in avian history, while loss of flight is commonplace.

By 2014, a mitochondrial DNA phylogeny including fossil members placed ostriches on the basal branch, followed by rheas, then a clade consisting of moas and tinamous, followed by the final two branches: a clade of emus plus cassowaries and one of elephant birds plus kiwis.

Vicariant speciation based on the plate tectonic split-up of Gondwana followed by continental drift would predict that the deepest phylogenetic split would be between African and all other ratites, followed by a split between South American and Australo-Pacific ratites, roughly as observed. However, the elephant bird–kiwi relation appears to require dispersal across oceans by flight, as apparently does the colonization of New Zealand by the moa and possibly the back-dispersal of tinamous to South America, if the latter occurred. The phylogeny as a whole suggests not only multiple independent origins of flightlessness, but also of gigantism (at least five times). Gigantism in birds tends to be insular; however, a ten-million-year-long window of opportunity for evolution of avian gigantism on continents may have existed following the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, in which ratites were able to fill vacant herbivorous niches before mammals attained large size. Some authorities, though, have been skeptical of the new findings and conclusions.

Kiwi and tinamous are the only palaeognath lineages not to evolve gigantism, perhaps because of competitive exclusion by giant ratites already present on New Zealand and South America when they arrived or arose. The fact that New Zealand has been the only land mass to recently support two major lineages of flightless ratites may reflect the near total absence of native mammals, which allowed kiwi to occupy a mammal-like nocturnal niche. However, various other landmasses such as South America and Europe have supported multiple lineages of flightless ratites that evolved independently, undermining this competitive exclusion hypothesis.

Most recently, studies on genetic and morphological divergence and fossil distribution show that paleognaths as a whole probably had an origin in the northern hemisphere. Early Cenozoic northern hemisphere paleognaths such as &quot;Lithornis&quot;, &quot;Pseudocrypturus&quot;, &quot;Paracathartes&quot; and &quot;Palaeotis&quot; appear to be the most basal members of the clade. The various ratite lineages were probably descended from flying ancestors that independently colonised South America and Africa from the north, probably initially in South America. From South America, they could have traveled overland to Australia via Antarctica, (by the same route marsupials are thought to have used to reach Australia) and then reached New Zealand and Madagascar via &quot;sweepstakes&quot; dispersals (rare low probability dispersal methods, such as long distance rafting) across the oceans. Gigantism would have evolved subsequent to trans-oceanic dispersals.

===Loss of flight===

Loss of flight allows birds to eliminate the costs of maintaining various flight-enabling adaptations like high pectoral muscle mass, hollow bones and a light build, et cetera. The basal metabolic rate of flighted species is much higher than that of flightless terrestrial birds. But energetic efficiency can only help explain the loss of flight when the benefits of flying are not critical to survival.

Research on flightless rails indicates the flightless condition evolved in the absence of predators. This shows flight to be generally necessary for survival and dispersal in birds. In apparent contradiction to this, many landmasses occupied by ratites are also inhabited by predatory mammals. However, the K–Pg extinction event created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of extant flightless ratites to evolve flightlessness. They subsequently underwent selection for large size. One hypothesis suggests that as predation pressure decreases on islands with low raptor species richness and no mammalian predators, the need for large, powerful flight muscles that make for a quick escape decreases. Moreover, raptor species tend to become generalist predators on islands with low species richness, as opposed to specializing in the predation of birds. An increase in leg size compensates for a reduction in wing length in insular birds that have not lost flight by providing a longer lever to increase force generated during the thrust that initiates takeoff.

== Description ==
Ratites in general have many physical characteristics in common, although many are not shared by the family Tinamidae, or tinamous. First, the breast muscles are underdeveloped. They do not have keeled sterna. Their wishbones (furculae) are almost absent. They have simplified wing skeletons and musculature. Their legs are stronger and do not have air chambers, except the femurs. Their tail and flight feathers have retrogressed or have become decorative plumes. They have no feather vanes, which means they do not need to oil their feathers, hence they have no preen glands. They have no separation of pterylae (feathered areas) and apteria (non-feathered areas), and finally, they have palaeognathous palates.

Ostriches have the greatest dimorphism, rheas show some dichromatism during the breeding season. Emus, cassowaries, and kiwis show some dimorphism, predominantly in size.

While the ratites share a lot of similarities, they also have major differences. Ostriches have only two toes, with one being much larger than the other. Cassowaries have developed long inner toenails, used defensively. Ostriches and rheas have prominent wings; although they do not use them to fly, they do use them in courtship and predator distraction.

Without exception, ratite chicks are capable of swimming and even diving.

On an allometric basis, paleognaths have generally smaller brains than neognaths. Kiwis are exceptions to this trend, and possess proportionally larger brains comparable to those of parrots and songbirds, though evidence for similar advanced cognitive skills is currently lacking.

=== Feeding and diet ===
Ratite chicks tend to be more omnivorous or insectivorous; similarities in adults end with feeding, as they all vary in diet and length of digestive tract, which is indicative of diet. Ostriches, with the longest tracts at , are primarily herbivorous. Rheas&#x27; tracts are next longest at , and they also have caeca. They are also mainly herbivores, concentrating on broad-leafed plants. However, they will eat insects if the opportunity arises. Emus have tracts of length, and have a more omnivorous diet, including insects and other small animals. Cassowaries have next to the shortest tracts at . Finally, kiwi have the shortest tracts and eat earthworms, insects, and other similar creatures. Moas and elephant birds were the largest native herbivores in their faunas, far larger than contemporary herbivorous mammals in the latter&#x27;s case.

Some extinct ratites might have had odder lifestyles, such as the narrow-billed &quot;Diogenornis&quot; and &quot;Palaeotis&quot;, compared to the shorebird-like lithornithids, and could imply similar animalivorous diets.

=== Reproduction ===
Ratites are different from the flying birds in that they needed to adapt or evolve certain features to protect their young. First and foremost is the thickness of the shells of their eggs. Their young are hatched more developed than most and they can run or walk soon thereafter. Also, most ratites have communal nests, where they share the incubating duties with others. Ostriches, and great spotted kiwis, are the only ratites where the female incubates; they share the duties, with the males incubating at night. Cassowaries and emu are polyandrous, with males incubating eggs and rearing chicks with no obvious contribution from females. Ostriches and rheas are polygynous with each male courting several females. Male rheas are responsible for building nests and incubating while ostrich males incubate only at night. Kiwis stand out as the exception with extended monogamous reproductive strategies where either the male alone or both sexes incubate a single egg. Unlike most birds, male ratites have a phallus that is inserted into the female&#x27;s cloaca during copulation.

== Ratites and humans ==
Ratites and humans have had a long relationship starting with the use of the egg for water containers, jewelry, or other art medium. Male ostrich feathers were popular for hats during the 18th century, which led to hunting and sharp declines in populations. Ostrich farming grew out of this need, and humans harvested feathers, hides, eggs, and meat from the ostrich. Emu farming also became popular for similar reasons and for their emu oil. Rhea feathers are popular for dusters, and eggs and meat are used for chicken and pet feed in South America. Ratite hides are popular for leather products like shoes.

=== United States regulation ===
The USDA&#x27;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) began a voluntary, fee-for-service ratite inspection program in 1995 to help the fledgling industry improve the marketability of the meat. A provision in the FY2001 USDA appropriations act (P.L. 106–387) amended the Poultry Products Inspection Act to make federal inspection of ratite meat mandatory as of April 2001 (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.).

<text>A CD ripper, CD grabber, or CD extractor is software that rips raw digital audio in Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD-DA) format tracks on a compact disc to standard computer sound files, such as WAV or MP3.

A more formal term used for the process of ripping audio CDs is digital audio extraction (DAE).

==History==
In the early days of computer CD-ROM drives and audio compression mechanisms (such as MP2), CD ripping was considered undesirable by copyright holders, with some attempting to retrofit copy protection into the simple ISO9660 standard. As time progressed, most music publishers became more open to the idea that since individuals had bought the music, they should be able to create a copy for their own personal use on their own computer. This is not yet entirely true; even with some current digital music delivery mechanisms, there are considerable restrictions on what an end user can do with their paid for (and therefore personally licensed) audio. Windows Media Player&#x27;s default behavior is to add copy protection measures to ripped music, with a disclaimer that if this is not done, the end user is held entirely accountable for what is done with their music. This suits most users who simply want to store their music on a memory stick, MP3 player or portable hard disk and listen to it on any PC or compatible device.

==Etymology==
The Jargon File entry for &quot;rip&quot; notes that the term originated in Amiga slang, where it referred to the extraction of multimedia content from program data. 

==Design==
As an intermediate step, some ripping programs save the extracted audio in a lossless format such as WAV, FLAC, or even raw PCM audio. The extracted audio can then be encoded with a lossy codec like MP3, Vorbis, WMA or AAC. The encoded files are more compact and are suitable for playback on digital audio players. They may also be played back in a media player program on a computer.

Most ripping programs will assist in tagging the encoded files with metadata. The MP3 file format, for example, allows tags with title, artist, album and track number information. Some will try to identify the disc being ripped by looking up network services like AMG&#x27;s LASSO, FreeDB, Gracenote&#x27;s CDDB, GD3 or MusicBrainz, or attempt text extraction if CD-Text has been stored.

Some all-in-one ripping programs can simplify the entire process by ripping and burning the audio to disc in one step, possibly re-encoding the audio on-the-fly in the process.

Some CD ripping software is specifically intended to provide an especially accurate or &quot;secure&quot; rip, including Exact Audio Copy, cdda2wav, CDex and cdparanoia.

==Compact disc seek jitter==
In the context of digital audio extraction from compact discs, seek jitter causes extracted audio samples to be doubled-up or skipped entirely if the Compact Disc drive re-seeks. The problem occurs because the Red Book does not require block-accurate addressing during seeking. As a result, the extraction process may restart a few samples early or late, resulting in doubled or omitted samples. These glitches often sound like tiny repeating clicks during playback. A successful approach to correction in software involves performing overlapping reads and fitting the data to find overlaps at the edges. Most extraction programs perform seek jitter correction. CD manufacturers avoid seek jitter by extracting the entire disc in one continuous read operation, using special CD drive models at slower speeds so the drive does not re-seek.

==Optical drive properties==
Properties of an optical drive helping in achieving a perfect rip are a small sample offset (at best zero), no jitter, no or deactivatable caching, and a correct implementation and feed-back of the C1 and C2 error states. There are databases listing these features for multiple brands and versions of optical drives. Also, EAC has the ability to autodetect some of these features by a test-rip of a known reference CD.

<text>Media player software is a type of application software for playing multimedia computer files like audio and video files. Media players commonly display standard media control icons known from physical devices such as tape recorders and CD players, such as play (  ), pause (  ), fastforward (⏩️), rewind (⏪), and stop (  ) buttons. In addition, they generally have progress bars (or &quot;playback bars&quot;), which are sliders to locate the current position in the duration of the media file.

Mainstream operating systems have at least one default media player. For example, Windows comes with Windows Media Player, Microsoft Movies &amp; TV and Groove Music, while macOS comes with QuickTime Player and Music. Linux distributions come with different media players, such as SMPlayer, Amarok, Audacious, Banshee, MPlayer, mpv, Rhythmbox, Totem, VLC media player, and xine. Android comes with YouTube Music for audio and Google Photos for video, and smartphone vendors such as Samsung may bundle custom software.

==Functionality focus==

The basic feature set of media players are a seek bar, a timer with the current and total playback time, playback controls (play, pause, previous, next, stop), playlists, a &quot;repeat&quot; mode, and a &quot;shuffle&quot; (or &quot;random&quot;) mode for curiosity and to facilitate searching long timelines of files.

Different media players have different goals and feature sets. &quot;Video players&quot; are a group of media players that have their features geared more towards playing digital video. For example, Windows DVD Player exclusively plays DVD-Video discs and nothing else. Media Player Classic can play individual audio and video files but many of its features such as color correction, picture sharpening, zooming, set of hotkeys, DVB support and subtitle support are only useful for video material such as films and cartoons. &quot;Audio players&quot;, on the other hand, specialize in digital audio. For example, AIMP exclusively plays audio formats. MediaMonkey can play both audio and video formats, but many of its features including media library, lyric discovery, music visualization, online radio, audiobook indexing, and tag editing are geared toward consumption of audio material; watching video files on it can be a trying feat. General-purpose media players also do exist. For example, Windows Media Player has exclusive features for both audio and video material, although it cannot match the feature set of Media Player Classic and MediaMonkey combined.

By default, videos are played with fully visible field of view while filling at least either width or height of the viewport to appear as large as possible. Options to change the video&#x27;s scaling and aspect ratio may include filling the viewport through either stretching or cropping, and &quot;100% view&quot; where each pixel of the video covers exactly one pixel on the screen.

Zooming into the field of view during playback may be implemented through a slider on any screen or with pinch zoom on touch screens, and moving the field of view may be implemented through scrolling by dragging inside the view port or by moving a rectangle inside a miniature view of the entire field of view that denotes the magnified area.

Media player software may have the ability to adjust appearance and acoustics during playback using effects such as mirroring, rotating, cropping, cloning, adjusting colours, deinterlacing, and equalizing and visualizing audio. Easter eggs may be featured, such as a puzzle game on VLC Media Player.

Still snapshots may be extracted directly from a video frame or captured through a screenshot, the former of which is preferred since it preserves videos&#x27; original dimensions (height and width). Video players may show a tooltip bubble previewing footage at the position hovered over with the mouse cursor.

A preview tooltip for the seek bar has been implemented on few smartphones through a stylus or a self-capacitive touch screen able to detect a floating finger. Such include the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5 (finger), Note 2, Note 4 (stylus), and Note 3 (both).

Streaming media players may indicate buffered segments of the media in the seek bar.

===3D video players===
3D video players are used to play 2D video in 3D format. A high-quality three-dimensional video presentation requires that each frame of a motion picture be embedded with information on the depth of objects present in the scene. This process involves shooting the video with special equipment from two distinct perspectives or modeling and rendering each frame as a collection of objects composed of 3D vertices and textures, much like in any modern video game, to achieve special effects. Tedious and costly, this method is only used in a small fraction of movies produced worldwide, while most movies remain in the form of traditional 2D images. It is, however, possible to give an otherwise two-dimensional picture the appearance of depth. Using a technique known as anaglyph processing a &quot;flat&quot; picture can be transformed so as to give an illusion of depth when viewed through anaglyph glasses (usually red-cyan). An image viewed through anaglyph glasses appears to have both protruding and deeply embedded objects in it, at the expense of somewhat distorted colors. The method itself is old enough, dating back to the mid-19th century, but it is only with recent advances in computer technology that it has become possible to apply this kind of transformation to a series of frames in a motion picture reasonably fast or even in real-time, i.e. as the video is being played back. Several implementations exist in the form of 3D video players that render conventional 2D video in anaglyph 3D, as well as in the form of 3D video converters that transform video into stereoscopic anaglyph and transcode it for playback with regular software or hardware video players.

==Examples==
Well known examples of media player software include Windows Media Player, VLC media player, iTunes, Winamp, Media Player Classic, MediaMonkey, foobar2000, AIMP, MusicBee and JRiver Media Center. Most of these also include music library managers.

Although media players are often multi-media, they can be primarily designed for a specific media. For example, Media Player Classic and VLC media player are video-focused while Winamp and iTunes are music-focused, despite all of them supporting both types of media.

==Home theater PC==

A home theater PC or media center computer is a convergence device that combines some or all the capabilities of a personal computer with a software application that supports video, photo, audio playback, and sometimes video recording functionality. Although computers with some of these capabilities were available from the late 1980s, the &quot;Home Theater PC&quot; term first appeared in mainstream press in 1996. Since 2007, other types of consumer electronics, including gaming systems and dedicated media devices have crossed over to manage video and music content. The term &quot;media center&quot; also refers to specialized computer programs designed to run on standard personal computers.

<text>An interface description language or interface definition language (IDL) is a generic term for a language that lets a program or object written in one language communicate with another program written in an unknown language. IDLs are usually used to describe data types and interfaces in a language-independent way, for example, between those written in C++ and those written in Java.

IDLs are commonly used in remote procedure call software. In these cases the machines at either end of the &quot;link&quot; may be using different operating systems and computer languages. IDLs offer a bridge between the two different systems.

Software systems based on IDLs include Sun&#x27;s ONC RPC, The Open Group&#x27;s Distributed Computing Environment, IBM&#x27;s System Object Model, the Object Management Group&#x27;s CORBA (which implements OMG IDL, an IDL based on DCE/RPC) and Data Distribution Service, Mozilla&#x27;s XPCOM, Microsoft&#x27;s Microsoft RPC (which evolved into COM and DCOM), Facebook&#x27;s Thrift and WSDL for Web services.

== Examples ==

* AIDL: Java-based, for Android; supports local and remote procedure calls, can be accessed from native applications by calling through Java Native Interface (JNI)
* Apache Thrift: from Apache, originally developed by Facebook
* Avro IDL: for the Apache Avro system
* ASN.1
* Cap&#x27;n Proto: created by its former maintainer, avoids some of the perceived shortcomings of Protocol Buffers.
* Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL, RFC 8610): A Notation for CBOR and JSON data structures
* CortoScript: Describe data and/or interfaces for systems that require Semantic interoperability
* Etch: Cisco&#x27;s Etch Cross-platform Service Description Language
* Extensible Data Notation (EDN): Clojure data format, similar to JSON
*FlatBuffers: Serialization format from Google supporting zero-copy deserialization
* Franca IDL: the open-source Franca interface definition language
* FIDL: Interface description language for the Fuchsia Operating System designed for writing app components in C, C++, Dart, Go and Rust. 
* IDL specification language: the original Interface Description Language
* IPL: Imandra Protocol Language
* JSON Web-Service Protocol (JSON-WSP)
* Lightweight Imaging Device Interface Language
* Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL): the Microsoft extension of OMG IDL to add support for Component Object Model (COM) and Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
* OMG IDL: standardized by Object Management Group, used in CORBA (for DCE/RPC services) and DDS (for data modeling), also selected by the W3C for exposing the DOM of XML, HTML, and CSS documents
* OpenAPI Specification: a standard for Web APIs, used by Swagger and other technologies. 
* Open Service Interface Definitions
* Protocol Buffers: Google&#x27;s IDL
* RESTful Service Description Language (RSDL)
* Smithy: An AWS-invented protocol-agnostic interface definition language.
* Specification Language for Internet Communications Engine (Ice: Slice)
* Universal Network Objects: OpenOffice.org&#x27;s component model
* Web Application Description Language (WADL)
* Web IDL by WHATWG: can be used to describe interfaces that are intended to be implemented in web browsers
* Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
* XCB: X protocol description language for X Window System
* Cross Platform Interface Description Language (XPIDL): Mozilla&#x27;s way to specify XPCOM interfaces

<text>Nestlé S.A. ( ) is a Swiss multinational food and drink processing conglomerate corporation headquartered in Vevey, Switzerland. It has been the largest publicly held food company in the world, measured by revenue and other metrics, since 2014. It ranked No. 64 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500 in 2017. In 2023, the company was ranked 50th in the &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000.

Nestlé&#x27;s products include coffee and tea, candy and confectionery, bottled water, infant formula and baby food, dairy products and ice cream, frozen foods, breakfast cereals, dry packaged foods and snacks, pet foods, and medical food. Twenty-nine of Nestlé&#x27;s brands have annual sales of over 1 billion CHF (about ), including Nespresso, Nescafé, Nestea, Kit Kat, Smarties, Nesquik, Stouffer&#x27;s, Vittel, and Maggi. Nestlé has 447 factories, operates in 189 countries, and employs around 339,000 people. It is one of the main shareholders of L&#x27;Oreal, the world&#x27;s largest cosmetics company.

Nestlé was formed in 1905 by the merger of the &quot;Anglo-Swiss Milk Company&quot;, which was established in 1866 by brothers George and Charles Page, and &quot;Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé&quot; founded in 1867 by Henri Nestlé. The company grew significantly during World War I and again following World War II, expanding its offerings beyond its early condensed milk and infant formula products. The company has made a number of corporate acquisitions including Findus in 1963, Libby&#x27;s in 1971, Rowntree Mackintosh in 1988, Klim in 1998, and Gerber in 2007.

==History==

===1866–1900: Founding and early years===

Nestlé&#x27;s origin dates back to the 1860s when two separate Swiss enterprises were founded that would later form Nestlé. In the following decades, the two competing enterprises expanded their businesses throughout Europe and the United States.

====Timeline====
* 1866: Charles Page (US consul to Switzerland) and George Page, brothers from Lee County, Illinois established the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company in Cham, Switzerland. The company&#x27;s first British operation was opened at Chippenham, Wiltshire in 1873.
* 1867: In Vevey, Switzerland, Henri Nestlé developed milk-based baby food and soon began marketing it. The following year, Daniel Peter began seven years of work perfecting the milk chocolate manufacturing process. Nestlé had the solution Peter needed to fix his problem of removing all the water from the milk added to his chocolate, thus preventing the product from developing mildew. 
* 1875: Henri Nestlé retired; the company, under new ownership, retained his name as &quot;Société Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé&quot;.
* 1877: Anglo-Swiss added milk-based baby foods to its products; in the following year, the Nestlé Company added condensed milk to its portfolio, which made the firms direct rivals.
* 1879: Nestlé merged with milk chocolate inventor Daniel Peter.
* 1890: Henri Nestlé died.

===1901–1989: Mergers===
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Henri Nestlé and his successors participated in the development of the chocolate industry in Switzerland, together with the Peter, Kohler, and Cailler families. In 1904, Daniel Peter and Charles-Amédée Kohler (son of Charles-Amédée Kohler who founded a chocolate factory in 1830) became partners and founded the &quot;Société générale suisse des chocolats Peter et Kohler réunis&quot;. In 1911, the company created by Peter and Kohler merged with Cailler. Alexandre Cailler (grandson of François-Louis Cailler) had founded a chocolate factory in Broc in 1898, still used by Nestlé today; which enabled the production of milk chocolate on a large scale. In 1929, Peter, Cailler, Kohler, Chocolats Suisses finally merged with the Nestlé group. An earlier alliance in 1904 between Peter and Nestlé also allowed the production of milk chocolate in the United States, at the Fulton plant.

In 1905, Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss merged to become the Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company, retaining that name until 1947 when the name &#x27;Nestlé Alimentana SA&#x27; was taken as a result of the acquisition of Fabrique de Produits Maggi SA (founded 1884) and its holding company, Alimentana SA, of Kempttal, Switzerland. The company&#x27;s current name was adopted in 1977. By the early 1900s, the company was operating factories in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain. The First World War created a demand for dairy products in the form of government contracts, and by the end of the war, Nestlé&#x27;s production had more than doubled.
In January 1919, Nestlé bought two condensed milk plants in Oregon from the company Geibisch and Joplin for $250,000. One was in Bandon, while the other was in Milwaukie. They expanded them considerably, processing 250,000 pounds of condensed milk daily in the Bandon plant.
After the World War I, government contracts dried up, and consumers switched back to fresh milk. However, Nestlé&#x27;s management responded quickly, streamlining operations and reducing debt. The 1920s saw Nestlé&#x27;s first expansion into new products, with chocolate-manufacture becoming the company&#x27;s second most important activity; white chocolate was created in the following decade. Louis Dapples was CEO till 1937 when succeeded by Édouard Muller till his death in 1948.

Nestlé felt the effects of the Second World War immediately. Profits dropped from US$20 million in 1938 to US$6 million in 1939. Factories were established in developing countries, particularly in South America. Ironically, the war helped with the introduction of the company&#x27;s newest product, Nescafé (&quot;Nestlé&#x27;s Coffee&quot;), which became a staple drink of the US military. Despite that, Nestlé actually supplied both sides in the war: the company had a contract to feed the German army. Nestlé&#x27;s production and sales rose in the wartime economy.
The end of World War II was the beginning of a dynamic phase for Nestlé. Growth accelerated and numerous companies were acquired. In 1947 Nestlé merged with Maggi, a manufacturer of seasonings and soups. Crosse &amp; Blackwell followed in 1950, as did Findus (1963), Libby&#x27;s (1971), and Stouffer&#x27;s (1973). Diversification came under chairman &amp; CEO Pierre Liotard-Vogt with a shareholding in L&#x27;Oreal in 1974 and the acquisition of Alcon Laboratories Inc. in 1977 for $280 million.

In the 1980s, Nestlé&#x27;s improved bottom line allowed the company to launch further acquisitions. Carnation was acquired for US$3 billion in 1984 and brought the evaporated milk brand, as well as Coffee-Mate and Friskies, to Nestlé. In 1986, the company founded Nestlé Nespresso S.A. The British confectionery company Rowntree Mackintosh was acquired in 1988 for $4.5 billion, which brought brands such as Kit Kat, Rolo, Smarties, and Aero.

===1990–2011: International growth===
The first half of the 1990s proved to be favourable for Nestlé. Trade barriers crumbled, and world markets developed into more or less integrated trading areas. Since 1996, there have been various acquisitions, including San Pellegrino (1997), D&#x27;Onofrio (1997), Spillers Petfoods (1998), and Ralston Purina (2002). There were two major acquistions in North America, both in 2002 – in June, Nestlé merged its US ice cream business into Dreyer&#x27;s, and in August, a acquisition was announced of Chef America, the creator of Hot Pockets. In the same time-frame, Nestlé entered in a joint bid with Cadbury and came close to purchasing the American company Hershey&#x27;s, one of its fiercest confectionery competitors, but the deal eventually fell through.

In 1999, Nestlé sold the Findus brand to the Swedish firm EQT AB.

In December 2005, Nestlé bought the Greek company Delta Ice Cream for €240 million. In January 2006, it took full ownership of Dreyer&#x27;s, thus becoming the world&#x27;s largest ice cream maker, with a 17.5% market share. In June 2006, Nestlé purchased weight-loss company Jenny Craig for . In July 2007, completing a deal announced the year before, Nestlé acquired the Medical Nutrition division of Novartis Pharmaceutical for and also acquiring the milk-flavoring product known as Ovaltine, the &quot;Boost&quot; and &quot;Resource&quot; lines of nutritional supplements, and Optifast dieting products.
In April 2007, returning to its roots, Nestlé bought US baby-food manufacturer Gerber for . In December 2007, Nestlé entered into a strategic partnership with a Belgian chocolate maker, Pierre Marcolini.

In late September 2008, the Hong Kong government found melamine in a Chinese-made Nestlé milk product. Six infants died from kidney damage, and a further 860 babies were hospitalised. The following June, an outbreak of &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 was linked to Nestlé&#x27;s refrigerated cookie dough originating in a plant in Danville, Virginia.

Nestlé agreed to sell its controlling stake in Alcon to Novartis on 4 January 2010. The sale was to form part of a broader offer by Novartis for full acquisition of the world&#x27;s largest eye-care company. On March 2, 2010, Nestlé completed the purchase of Kraft Foods&#x27;s North American frozen pizza business for , which included brands such as DiGiorno, Tombstone, and California Pizza Kitchen.

Since 2010, Nestlé has been working to transform itself into a nutrition, health and wellness company in an effort to combat declining confectionery sales and the threat of expanding government regulation of such foods. This effort is being led through the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences under the direction of Ed Baetge. The institute aims to develop &quot;a new industry between food and pharmaceuticals&quot; by creating foodstuffs with preventive and corrective health properties that would replace pharmaceutical drugs from pill bottles. The Health Science branch has already produced several products, such as drinks and protein shakes meant to combat malnutrition, diabetes, digestive health, obesity, and other diseases.

It acquired British pharmaceutical company Vitaflo, which makes clinical nutritional products for people with genetic disorders, in August 2010. In July 2011, Nestlé SA agreed to buy 60 percent of Hsu Fu Chi International Ltd. for about . On 23 April 2012, Nestlé agreed to acquire Pfizer Inc.&#x27;s infant-nutrition, formerly Wyeth Nutrition, unit for , topping a joint bid from Danone and Mead Johnson.

===2012–present===
In recent years, Nestlé Health Science has made several acquisitions: CM&amp;D Pharma Ltd., a company that specialises in the development of products for patients with chronic conditions like kidney disease; and Prometheus Laboratories, a firm specialising in treatments for gastrointestinal diseases and cancer. It also holds a minority stake in Vital Foods, a New Zealand-based company that develops kiwifruit-based food products as of 2012.

Nestlé sold its Jenny Craig business unit to North Castle Partners in 2013. In February 2013, Nestlé Health Science bought Pamlab, which makes medical foods based on L-methylfolate targeting depression, diabetes, and memory loss. In February 2014, Nestlé sold its PowerBar sports nutrition business to Post Holdings, Inc. Later, in November 2014, Nestlé announced that it was exploring strategic options for its frozen food subsidiary, Davigel.

In December 2014, Nestlé announced that it was opening 10 skin care research centres worldwide, deepening its investment in a faster-growing market for healthcare products. That year, Nestlé spent about $350 million on dermatology research and development. The first of the research hubs, Nestlé Skin Health Investigation, Education and Longevity Development (SHIELD) centres, will open mid 2015 in New York, followed by Hong Kong and São Paulo, and later others in North America, Asia, and Europe. The initiative is being launched in partnership with the Global Coalition on Aging (GCOA), a consortium that includes companies such as Intel and Bank of America.

In May 2015, food safety regulators from the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, found that samples of Nestlé India&#x27;s Maggi noodles had up to 17 times more than the permissible safe amount of lead, in addition to monosodium glutamate.

In January 2017, Nestlé announced that it was relocating its US headquarters from Glendale, California, to Rosslyn, Virginia, outside of Washington, DC.

In March 2017, Nestlé announced that they will lower the sugar content in Kit Kat, Yorkie and Aero chocolate bars by 10% by 2018. In July, a similar announcement followed concerning the reduction of sugar content in its breakfast cereals in the UK.

The company announced a $20.8 billion share buyback in June 2017, following the publication of a letter written by Third Point Management founder Daniel S. Loeb, Nestlé&#x27;s fourth-largest stakeholder with a $3.5 billion stake, explaining how the firm should change its business structure. Consequently, the firm will reportedly focus investment on sectors such as coffee and pet care and will seek acquisitions in the consumer health-care industry.

In 2016, Nestlé and PAI Partners establish a joint venture, Froneri, to combine the two companies&#x27; ice cream activities throughout Europe and other international countries.

In March 2017, Nestlé and Coca-Cola agreed to dissolve the Beverage Partners Worldwide venture effective on January 1, 2018, in part because Nestlé wanted to expand Nestea on its own.

In July 2017, Nestlé introduced a new type of infant formula in Spain, containing two human milk oligosaccharides. Oligosaccharides are the third most abundant components of breast milk with various health benefits, but previously were not part of infant formula.

In September 2017, Nestlé S.A. acquired a majority stake of Blue Bottle Coffee. While the deal&#x27;s financial details were not disclosed, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported &quot;Nestlé is understood to be paying up to $500m for the 68 per cent stake in Blue Bottle&quot;.

In September 2017, Nestlé USA agreed to acquire Sweet Earth, a California-based producer of plant-based foods, for an undisclosed sum.

Nestlé set a new profit target in September 2017 and agreed to offload over 20 of its US candy brands in January 2018. However, sales grew only 2.4% in 2017, and as of July 2018, the share price declined more than 8%. While some suggestions were adopted, Loeb said in a July 2018 letter that the shifts are too small and too slow. In a statement, Nestlé wrote that it was &quot;delivering results&quot; and listed actions it had taken, including investing in key brands and its global coffee partnership with Starbucks. However, activist investors disagreed, leading Third Point Management to launch NestleNOW, a website to push its case with recommendations calling for change, accusing Nestlé of not being as fast, aggressive, or strategic as it needs to be. Activist investors called for Nestlé to divide into three units with distinct CEOs, regional structures, and marketing heads - beverage, nutrition, and grocery; spin off more businesses that do not fit its model such as ice cream, frozen foods, and confectionery; and add an outsider with expertise in the food and beverage industry to the board.

In January 2018, Nestlé USA announced it was selling its US confectionary business including the 100 Grand, BabyRuth, Butterfinger, OhHenry!, Raisinets and SnoCaps to Ferrara Candy Company, an american based chocolate and candy maker and Ferrero-related company. The company was sold for a total of an estimated $2.8 billion.

In May 2018, it was announced that Nestlé and Starbucks struck a $7.15 billion distribution deal, which allows Nestlé to market, sell and distribute Starbucks coffee globally and to incorporate the brand&#x27;s coffee varieties into Nestlé&#x27;s proprietary single-serve system, expanding the overseas markets for both companies.

In September 2018, Nestlé announced that it would sell Gerber Life Insurance for $1.55 billion.

In October 2018, Nestlé announced the launch of the Nestlé Alumni Network, through a strategic partnership with SAP &amp; EnterpriseAlumni, to engage with their over 1 million alumni globally.

In 2019, the company announced that it would publish Nutri-Score on all of its products sold in the European countries that supported the nutritional label.

In 2020, Nestlé USA&#x27;s and Nestlé Canada&#x27;s ice cream divisions were acquired by Froneri. Also during that year, Nestlé announced that the company wants to invest in plant-based food, starting with a &quot;tuna salad&quot; and meat-free products to engage and reach younger and vegan consumers.

On 16 February 2021, Nestlé announced that it had agreed to sell its water brands in the US and Canada to One Rock Capital Partners and Metropoulos &amp; Co. The sale would include the spring water and mountain brands, the purified water brand and the delivery service. The plan did not include the Perrier, S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna brands. In early April 2021, the sale was concluded.

The COVID-19 pandemic did not affect Nestlé negatively. Due to lockdowns, people bought more packaged foods, not only coffee and dairy products, but also pet products, which increased the company&#x27;s sales. Nestlé is recording its strongest quarterly sales growth in 10 years.

In April 2021, Nestlé agreed to purchase the vitamin manufacturing Bountiful Company, formerly known as The Nature&#x27;s Bounty Co., for $5.75 billion, noting as well that much of the company&#x27;s growth that quarter came from &quot;vitamins, minerals, and supplements that support health and the immune system&quot;. Bountiful&#x27;s brands included Nature&#x27;s Bounty, Solgar, Osteo Bi-Flex, and Puritan&#x27;s Pride.

In July 2021, Vitaflo International Ltd. (subsidiary to Nestlé Health Science since 2010) acquired the Dr. Schär brands, Mevalia and ComidaMed, which are used for the dietary management of IEM and cow&#x27;s milk protein allergy to complement Vitaflo&#x27;s existing IEM product portfolio.

In January 2022, Nestlé announced that will pay African cocoa farmers cash if they send their children to school.

In May 2022, it was announced Nestlé&#x27;s Health Science unit had acquired the Brazilian organic, natural, plant-based food maker Puravida.

In May 2022, Nestlé was sending baby formula supplies to the U.S. from European air bases to ease the 2022 United States infant formula shortage. These relief shipments included products from the Gerber baby food formula brand from the Netherlands and Alfamino baby formula from Switzerland.

In September 2023, it was announced Nestlé had acquired a majority stake in the Extrema, Minas Gerais-headquartered premium chocolate manufacturer, Grupo CRM for an undisclosed amount.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the company continued doing business in Russia; therefore in November 2023, Ukraine&#x27;s National Agency on Corruption Prevention listed Nestlé as an International Sponsor of War. Nestle stated that it had already &quot;halted all non-essential imports and exports to and from Russia&quot;.

In February 2024, it was announced Nestle is expanding manufacturing capacity in India and increasing investments — the company will invest between ₹60-65 billion ($723–783 million) from 2020 to 2025.

The Grand National Assembly of Turkey announced that Nestlé products (as well as some other products) will not be sold in restaurants, cafeterias and tea houses in the parliament campus. They said that this was a response to the manufacturers&#x27; support for Israel, but they did not identify anything the companies had actually done. That month, Nestlé announced Schneider would leave his position as CEO and be replaced by Laurent Freixe on September 1, 2024.

==Sponsorships==

===Music and entertainment===

In 1993, plans were made to update and modernise the overall tone of Walt Disney&#x27;s EPCOT Center, including a major refurbishment of The Land pavilion. Kraft Foods withdrew its sponsorship on 26 September 1993, with Nestlé taking its place. Co-financed by Nestlé and the Walt Disney World Resort, a gradual refurbishment of the pavilion began on 27 September 1993. In 2003, Nestlé renewed its sponsorship of The Land; however, it was under agreement that Nestlé would oversee its own refurbishment to both the interior and exterior of the pavilion. Between 2004 and 2005, the pavilion underwent its second major refurbishment. Nestlé stopped sponsoring The Land in 2009.

On 5 August 2010, Nestlé and the Beijing Music Festival signed an agreement to extend by three years Nestlé&#x27;s sponsorship of this international music festival. Nestlé has been an extended sponsor of the Beijing Music Festival for 11 years since 2000. The new agreement will continue the partnership through 2013.

Nestlé has partnered the Salzburg Festival in Austria for 20 years. In 2011, Nestlé renewed its sponsorship of the Salzburg Festival until 2015.

Together, they have created the &quot;Nestlé and Salzburg Festival Young Conductors Award&quot;, an initiative that aims to discover young conductors globally and to contribute to the development of their careers.

===Sports===
Nestlé&#x27;s sponsorship of the Tour de France began in 2001 and the agreement was extended in 2004, a move which demonstrated the company&#x27;s interest in the Tour. In July 2009, Nestlé Waters and the organisers of the Tour de France announced that their partnership will continue until 2013. The main promotional benefits of this partnership will spread on four key brands from Nestlé&#x27;s product portfolio: Vittel, Powerbar, Nesquik, or Ricore.

On 27 January 2012, the International Association of Athletics Federations announced that Nestlé will be the main sponsor for the further development of IAAF&#x27;s Kids&#x27; Athletics Programme, which is one of the biggest grassroots development programmes in the world of sports. The five-year sponsorship started in January 2012. On 11 February 2016, Nestlé decided to withdraw its sponsorship of the IAAF&#x27;s Kids&#x27; Athletics Programmes because of doping and corruption allegations against the IAAF. Nestlé followed suit after other large sponsors, including Adidas, also stopped supporting the IAAF.

In 2014, Nestlé Waters sponsored the UK leg of the Tour de France through its Buxton Natural Mineral Water brand.
In 2002, Nestlé announced it was main sponsor for the Great Britain Lionesses Women&#x27;s rugby league team for the team&#x27;s second tour of Australia with its Munchies product.

Nestlé supports the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) on a number of nutrition and fitness fronts, funding a Fellowship position in AIS Sports Nutrition; nutrition activities in the AIS Dining Hall; research activities; and the development of education resources for use at the AIS and in the public domain.

== Corporate social responsibility ==
In March 2011, Nestlé became the first infant formula company to meet the FTSE4Good Index criteria in full.

In 2021, recycling startup, Carbios, released a press release that showed a
prototype of a food-grade PET plastic bottle made from enzymatically recycled plastic. The press release said Nestle (along with other companies) could manufacture these bottles using the Carbios technology. As of September 2024, however, it is unclear whether Nestle ever transitioned to these recycled materials beyond the prototype.

Nestlé created the Creating Shared Value Prize, which is awarded every other year with the aim of rewarding the best examples of CSV initiatives worldwide and to encourage other companies to adopt a shared value approach. These initiatives should take a business-oriented approach in addressing challenges in nutrition, water or rural development. The winner can win up to CHF 500,000. Nestlé was an early mover in the shared value space and hosts a global forum, the Creating Shared Value Global Forum.

Rural Development Framework program: In 2012, Nestlé developed the Rural Development Framework, which supports farmers and cocoa growing communities. It is an investment program aimed at improving infrastructure, increasing access to safe water, address financing and market efficiency gaps, and improving labor conditions.

== Awards ==
==Controversies==
The company has been associated with various controversies, facing criticism and boycotts over its marketing of baby formula as an alternative to breastfeeding in developing countries (where clean water may be scarce), its reliance on suppliers that use child labour in cocoa production, and its production and promotion of bottled water.

Nestlé is involved in many significant controversies due to Nestlé&#x27;s reported use of

* incidents of contaminated and infested food products,
* actively spreading disinformation about recycling,
* illegal water-pumping from drought-stricken Native American reservations,
* preventing access to non-bottled water in impoverished countries,
* price fixing,
* slave labor,
* child labor,
* extensive union-busting activity, and
* deforestation.

=== Baby formula marketing ===
Concern about Nestlé&#x27;s &quot;aggressive marketing&quot; of their breast milk substitutes, particularly in less economically developed countries (LEDCs), first arose in the 1970s. Critics have accused Nestlé of discouraging mothers from breastfeeding and suggesting that their baby formula is healthier than breastfeeding. This led to the 1977 Nestlé boycott in the United States and Europe.

=== Slave labour and child labour ===
Multiple reports have documented the widespread use of child labour as well as slavery and child trafficking by cocoa suppliers, throughout West African plantations, on which Nestlé and other major chocolate companies rely.

=== Water ===
At the second World Water Forum in 2000, Nestlé and other corporations persuaded the World Water Council to change its statement so as to reduce access to drinking water from a &quot;right&quot; to a &quot;need&quot;. Nestlé continues to take control of aquifers and bottle their water for profit.

A coalition of environmental groups filed a complaint against Nestlé to the Advertising Standards of Canada after Nestlé took out full-page advertisements in October 2008 with messages claiming, &quot;Most water bottles avoid landfill sites and are recycled&quot;, &quot;Nestlé Pure Life is a healthy, eco-friendly choice&quot;, and, &quot;Bottled water is the most environmentally responsible consumer product in the world.&quot;

<doc id="160232" wikidata="Q192512" url="?curid=160232" title="Mengistu Haile Mariam">
<text>Mengistu Haile Mariam (, pronunciation: ; born 21 May 1937) is an Ethiopian former politician, revolutionary and former military officer who was the head of state of Ethiopia from 1977 to 1991 and General Secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Ethiopia from 1984 to 1991. He was the chairman of the Derg, the Marxist-Leninist military junta that governed Ethiopia, from 1977 to 1987, and the president of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) from 1987 to 1991.

The Derg took power in the Ethiopian Revolution following the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1974, marking the end of the Solomonic dynasty which had ruled Ethiopia since the 13th century. Mengistu purged rivals for power from the Derg and made himself dictator of Ethiopia, attempting to modernize the feudal economy of Ethiopia through Marxist-Leninist-inspired policies such as nationalization and land redistribution. His bloody consolidation of power in 1977–1978 is known as the Ethiopian Red Terror, a brutal crackdown on opposition groups and civilians following a failed assassination attempt by the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (EPRP) in September 1976, after it had ignored the Derg&#x27;s invitation to join the union of socialist parties. The death toll is unknown but is often estimated at between 30,000 and 750,000.

Internal rebellion, government repression, and economic mismanagement characterized Mengistu&#x27;s presidency, the Red Terror period being a battle for dominance between the Derg, the EPRP, and their rival the All-Ethiopia Socialist Movement (MEISON), which had initially aligned itself with the Derg. While this internal conflict was being fought, Ethiopia was threatened by both the Somali invasion and the guerrilla campaign of the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front, who demanded independence for Eritrea, then a province of Ethiopia. The Ogaden War of 1977–1978 with Somalia, fought over a disputed border region (Ogaden), was notable for the prominent role of Mengistu&#x27;s Soviet and Cuban allies in securing an Ethiopian victory. The catastrophic famine of 1983–1985 is what brought his government the most international attention.

Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe in May 1991 after the PDRE National Shengo dissolved itself and called for a transitional government. His departure brought an abrupt end to the Ethiopian Civil War. Mengistu Haile Mariam still lives in Harare, Zimbabwe, despite an Ethiopian court verdict which found him guilty of genocide &quot;in absentia&quot;. Mengistu&#x27;s government is estimated to be responsible for the deaths of 500,000 to 2,000,000 Ethiopians, mostly during the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia.

==Early life==
Mengistu Haile Mariam was born on 21 May 1937 in Welayta, Kaffa during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia. There are conflicting reports about his origins, which are said to be of a slave family from the south.

After the Italians were defeated and expelled from the country in 1941, his parents moved to Debre Markos where his father Haile Mariam joined Haile Selassie&#x27;s fledgling army and received the rank of corporal. Corporal Haile Mariam was then transferred to the ammunition&#x27;s production unit of the imperial army in Addis Ababa. Mengistu was raised in the household of Dejazmatch Kebede Tesemma (the former governor of Gojjam), where Mengistu&#x27;s mother is said to have worked as a domestic servant, and his father became Kebede&#x27;s house guard. Mengistu was raised partially in Ethiopian Empire Army camps around the country and partly within the compound of the aristocratic family. In Debre Markos, Mengistu attended the Negus Tekle Haimanot School where he was known to be a problematic teenager and not serious with his studies, he was later expelled from high school for misbehavior. Mengistu then joined the army at a very young age.

==Army life==
As an ambitious young soldier, he attracted the attention of the Eritrean-born General Aman Andom, who raised him to the rank of sergeant and assigned him duties as an errand boy in his office. Aman then recommended him to the Holetta Military Academy, one of the two important military academies of Ethiopia. After Mengistu graduated from the Holetta Military Academy in 1957, he received the rank of Second Lieutenant. General Aman then became his mentor, and when the General was assigned to the commander of the Third Division took Mengistu with him to Harar, and later was assigned as an ordnance officer in the Third Division. He was subsequently sent to the US for the first time in 1964 to the Savanna Army Depot in Illinois for an Ordnance testing course for six months.

Aman was abruptly transferred to Addis Ababa. The imperial regime found him too popular with the soldiers, especially after his commendable military exploits in the engagement against the Somali army at Tog Wuchale during the 1964 Ethiopian–Somali Border War. Prime Minister Aklilu Habte Wold removed the general affectionately known to his men as &quot;the desert lion&quot; from army duties and assigned him as a senator, a job he hated very much as he recounted to his author, but could not refuse without arousing the Emperor&#x27;s ire. Aman&#x27;s replacement was General Haile Baikedagn, who found Mengistu an intriguer and a very dangerous young officer. General Haile had actually written a secret report to his superiors to put a close watch on Mengistu and not give him a raise in the military ranks. A few years before his second departure for training to the US he was in conflict with the then Third Division commander General Haile Baykedagn whose policy of strict discipline and order did not sit well with Mengistu. At the time, the ordnance group was offered military technical training support in the US. Despite his disapproval of Mengistu&#x27;s insubordination and disrespect, the General was obliged to release him and Mengistu went for an 18-month training program at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, United States. He also took some night classes at the University of Maryland, making him fluent in English. He returned for a third time in 1970, this time as a student at the Combined Arms Center in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Returning after his training, he was expected to command the ordnance sub-division in Harar, but was prevented by General Haile Baykedagn who cited his previous insubordination. Years later, Mengistu would murder General Haile Baykedagn along with 60 ministers and generals.

Mengistu typically endured derogatory comments about his appearance, rooted in his Konso background. His features were far more &quot;negroid&quot; than the average highlander Ethiopian, which Paul Henze believes gave him an inferiority complex. Henze also notes that while receiving military training in the United States, Mengistu experienced racial discrimination which led him to develop a strong anti-American sentiment, but Henze was unable to find any evidence of such incidents. When he took power, and attended the meeting of Derg members at the Fourth Division headquarters in Addis Ababa, Mengistu exclaimed with emotion:
In this country, some aristocratic families automatically categorize persons with dark skin, thick lips, and kinky hair as &quot;Barias&quot; (Amharic for slave)... let it be clear to everybody that I shall soon make these ignoramuses stoop and grind corn! 

Bahru Zewde notes that Mengistu was distinguished by a &quot;special ability to size up situations and persons&quot;. Although Bahru notes that some observers &quot;rather charitably&quot; equated this ability with intelligence, the academic believes this skill is more akin to &quot;street smarts&quot;: &quot;it is rather closer to the mark to see it as inner-city smartness (or what in local parlance would be called &quot;aradanat&quot;).&quot;

==The rise of the Derg==

Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s government, having lost the confidence of the Ethiopian public following a drought and crop failures in Wollo province, was overthrown in the Ethiopian revolution of 1974. As a result, power came into the hands of a committee of low-ranking officers and enlisted soldiers led by Atnafu Abate, which came to be known as the Derg. Mengistu was originally one of the lesser members, officially sent to represent the Third Division because his commander, General Nega Tegnegn, considered him a trouble-maker and wanted to get rid of him. Between July and September 1974 through sheer demagoguery and political intrigues, Mengistu succeeded to outmaneuver all officers who stood in his way and climbed the political ladder. Mengistu and Atnafu Abate were the deputy chairmen of Derg from March 1975 to February 1977.

Haile Selassie died in 1975. It is rumored that Mengistu smothered the Emperor using a pillowcase, but Mengistu has denied these rumors. Though several groups were involved in the overthrow, the Derg succeeded to power. There is no doubt that the Derg under Mengistu&#x27;s leadership ordered the execution without trial of 61 ex-officials of the Imperial government on 23 November 1974, and later of numerous other former nobles and officials including the Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abuna Theophilos, in 1977. Mengistu himself has acknowledged that the Derg ordered these deaths but refuses to accept personal responsibility. Members of the Derg have contradicted him in interviews given from prison, saying he conspired and was in full agreement with their decisions.

==Leadership of Ethiopia==
Mengistu did not emerge as the leader of the Derg until after the 3 February 1977 shootout, in which Chairman Tafari Benti was killed. The vice-chairman of the Derg, Atnafu Abate, clashed with Mengistu over the issue of how to handle the war in Eritrea and lost, leading to his execution with 40 other officers, clearing the way for Mengistu to assume control. He formally assumed power as head of state, and justified his execution of Abate (on 13 November of that year) by claiming that he had &quot;placed the interests of Ethiopia above the interests of socialism&quot; and undertaken other &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; activities. 

===Political conflicts===
Resistance against the Derg ensued, led primarily by the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (EPRP). Mengistu cracked down on the EPRP and other revolutionary student organizations in what would become called the &quot;Red Terror&quot;. The Derg subsequently turned against the socialist student movement MEISON, a major supporter against the EPRP, in what would be called the &quot;White Terror&quot;.

The EPRP&#x27;s efforts to discredit and undermine the Derg and its MEISON collaborators escalated in the fall of 1976. It targeted public buildings and other symbols of state authority for bombings and assassinated numerous Abyot Seded and MEISON members, as well as public officials at all levels. The Derg, which countered with its own counter-terrorism campaign, labeled the EPRP&#x27;s tactics the White Terror. Mengistu asserted that all &quot;progressives&quot; were given &quot;freedom of action&quot; in helping root out the revolution&#x27;s enemies, and his wrath was particularly directed toward the EPRP. Peasants, workers, public officials, and even students thought to be loyal to the Mengistu regime were provided with arms to accomplish this task.

In a public speech in April 1977, Mengistu shouted &quot;Death to counterrevolutionaries! Death to the EPRP!&quot; and then produced three bottles filled with a red liquid that symbolized the blood of the imperialists and the counterrevolutionaries and smashed them to the ground to show what the revolution would do to its enemies. Thousands of young men and women turned up dead in the streets of the capital and other cities in the following months. They were systematically murdered mainly by the militia attached to the kebeles, the neighborhood watch committees which served during Mengistu&#x27;s reign as the lowest level local government and security surveillance units. Families had to pay the kebeles a tax known as &quot;the wasted bullet&quot; to obtain the bodies of their loved ones. In May 1977, the Swedish general secretary of the Save the Children Fund stated that &quot;1,000 children have been killed, and their bodies are left in the streets and are being eaten by wild hyenas. You can see the heaped-up bodies of murdered children, most of them aged eleven to thirteen, lying in the gutter, as you drive out of Addis Ababa.&quot; Amnesty International estimates that up to 500,000 people were killed during the Ethiopian Red Terror.

Military gains made by the monarchist Ethiopian Democratic Union in Begemder were rolled back when that party split just as it was on the verge of capturing the old capital of Gondar. The army of the Somali Democratic Republic invaded Ethiopia, having overrun the Ogaden region, and was on the verge of capturing Harar and Dire Dawa, when Somalia&#x27;s erstwhile allies, the Soviets and the Cubans, launched an unprecedented arms and personnel airlift to come to rescue of Ethiopia. The Derg government turned back the Somali invasion and made deep strides against the Eritrean secessionists and the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) as well. By the end of the seventies, Mengistu presided over the second-largest army in all of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as a formidable air force and navy.

===Embracing Marxism–Leninism===

After coming to power, Mengistu embraced the philosophy of Marxism–Leninism, which was increasingly popular among many nationalists and revolutionaries throughout Africa and much of the Third World at the time. In the mid-1970s, under Mengistu&#x27;s leadership, the Derg regime radicalized and began an aggressive program of changing system of Ethiopia from a mixed feudal-capitalist emergent economy to an Eastern Bloc-style command economy. All rural land was nationalized, stripping the Ethiopian Church, the Imperial family, and the nobility of all their sizable estates and the bulk of their wealth. During this same period, all foreign-owned and locally owned companies were nationalized without compensation in an effort to redistribute the country&#x27;s wealth. All undeveloped urban property and all rental property were also nationalized. Private businesses such as banks and insurance companies, large retail businesses, etc. were also taken over by the government. All this nationalized property was brought under the administration of large bureaucracies set up to administer them. Farmers who had once worked on land owned by absentee landlords were now compelled to join collective farms. All agricultural products were no longer to be offered on the free market but were to be controlled and distributed by the government. Despite progressive agricultural reforms, under the Derg, agricultural output suffered due to civil war, drought and misguided economic policies. There was also a famine in 1984, which was the 10th anniversary of the Derg.

The Soviets hailed Ethiopia for its supposed similar cultural and historical parallels to the USSR. Moscow said it proved that a backward society could become revolutionary by adopting a Leninist system. It was hailed as a model junior ally that Moscow was eager to support. In the 1980s Ethiopia plunged into greater turmoil and the Soviet system itself was collapsing by 1990. Russian commentators had turned scornful of the Ethiopian regime.

In early 1984, under Mengistu&#x27;s direction, the Marxist–Leninist Workers&#x27; Party of Ethiopia (WPE) was founded as the country&#x27;s ruling party, with Mengistu as general secretary. On 10 September 1987, a new Soviet-style constitution was adopted, and the country was renamed the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. Mengistu became president, with sweeping executive and legislative powers. Due to the doctrine of democratic centralism, he was effectively a dictator. He and the other surviving members of the Derg all retired from the military. However, even as civilians, they dominated the Politburo of the WPE. In the late 1980s, some Western critics of Mengistu, including Michael Johns of The Heritage Foundation, charged that Mengistu&#x27;s economic, military and political policies, along with the Soviet Union&#x27;s support for Mengistu, were key contributing factors to the mid-1980s Ethiopian famine, which ultimately took over 500,000 lives. Mengistu made seven visits to the Soviet Union between 1977 and 1984, as well as other visits to his political allies Cuba, East Germany, South Yemen, and Mozambique. From 1983 to 1984 Mengistu served as head of the Organization of African Unity.

However, the government&#x27;s military position gradually weakened. First came the Battle of Afabet in March 1989, a defeat at the hands of the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front, with 15,000 casualties and the loss of a great deal of equipment. This was followed up less than a year later by another crushing defeat at Shire, with over 20,000 men either killed or captured and the loss of even more equipment. On 16 May 1989, while Mengistu was out of the country for a four-day state visit to East Germany, senior military officials attempted a coup, and the Minister of Defense, Haile Giyorgis Habte Mariam, was killed; Mengistu returned within 24 hours and nine generals, including the air force commander and the army chief of staff, died as the coup was crushed.

==Removal from power; asylum in Zimbabwe==
By 1990, the Soviet Union had all but ended its support for Mengistu&#x27;s regime. In May 1991, the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) forces advanced on Addis Ababa from all sides, and Mengistu fled the country with 50 family and Derg members. He was granted asylum in Zimbabwe as an official guest of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Although Mugabe has since been removed from power in 2017, no new extradition requests have been submitted.

Mengistu left behind almost the entire membership of the original Derg and the WPE leadership. The regime only survived without him for another week before the EPRDF streamed into the capital, precluding the previous leadership&#x27;s escape. Almost all were promptly arrested and put on trial upon the assumption of power by the EPRDF. Mengistu has claimed that the takeover of his country resulted from the policies of Mikhail Gorbachev, who in his view allowed the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the termination of its aid to Ethiopia.

An assassination attempt against Mengistu occurred on 4 November 1995, while he was out walking with his wife, Wubanchi Bishaw, near his home in the Gunhill suburb of Harare. While Mengistu was unharmed, his alleged attacker, Solomon Haile Ghebre Michael, an Eritrean, was shot and arrested by Mengistu&#x27;s bodyguards. He was later tried for this assassination attempt, pleading not guilty in a Zimbabwean court on 8 July 1996. The Eritrean Ambassador to South Africa, Tsegaye Tesfa Tsion, flew to Harare to attend the trial. The attacker was sentenced to ten years in prison, while his accomplice Abraham Goletom Joseph, who had been arrested in a police raid, was sentenced to five years. They said that they had been tortured under Mengistu, and on appeal, their sentences were reduced to two years each due to &quot;mitigatory circumstances&quot;. The Ethiopian ambassador to Zimbabwe, Fantahun Haile Michael, said his government was not involved in the assassination attempt, and that he heard about the incident from the media.

, Mengistu still resided in Zimbabwe, despite the Ethiopian government&#x27;s desire that he be extradited. He is said to live in luxurious circumstances, and it is claimed that he advised Mugabe on security matters; according to Zimbabwean intelligence sources, he proposed the idea of clearing slums, which was implemented as Operation Murambatsvina in 2005, and chaired meetings at which the operation was planned. However, the State Security Minister Didymus Mutasa strongly denied that Mengistu was involved in Operation Murambatsvina.

In 2018, the former prime minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn published a photo of himself meeting with Mengistu. He withdrew the photo after criticism.

In May 2022, Zimbabwe suggested it might extradite Mengistu Haile Mariam to Ethiopia.

==Genocide trial==

Mengistu was charged by the Ethiopian government led by Meles Zenawi, &quot;in absentia&quot;, for the killing of nearly 2,000 people. The charge sheet and evidence list for his crimes were 8,000 pages long. The evidence against him included signed execution orders, videos of torture sessions, and personal testimony.
The trial began in 1994 and ended in 2006. The court found Mengistu guilty as charged on 12 December 2006, and imposed a life sentence in January 2007. In addition to the genocide conviction, the court found him guilty of imprisonment, illegal homicide, and illegal confiscation of property. Michael Clough, a US attorney and longtime observer of Ethiopia, said in a statement:
The biggest problem with prosecuting Mengistu for genocide is that his actions did not necessarily target a particular group. They were directed against anybody who was opposing his government, and they were generally much more political than based on any ethnic targeting.
Some experts believe hundreds of thousands of university students, intellectuals, and politicians (including Emperor Haile Selassie) were killed during Mengistu&#x27;s rule. Amnesty International estimates that a total of half a million people were killed during the Red Terror of 1977 and 1978. Human Rights Watch describes the Red Terror as &quot;one of the most systematic uses of mass murder by a state ever witnessed in Africa.&quot; During his reign it was not uncommon to see students, suspected government critics, or rebel sympathizers hanging from lampposts each morning. Mengistu himself is alleged to have murdered opponents by garroting or shooting them, saying that he was leading by example. Estimates of the number of deaths for which he was responsible range from 500,000 to over 2,000,000.

106 Derg officials were accused of genocide during the trials, but only 36 of them were present in the court. Several former members of the Derg have been sentenced to death. After Mengistu&#x27;s conviction in December 2006, the Zimbabwean government said that he still enjoyed asylum and would not be extradited. A Zimbabwean government spokesman explained this by saying that &quot;Mengistu and his government played a key and commendable role during our struggle for independence&quot;. According to the spokesman, Mengistu assisted Zimbabwean guerrilla fighters during the Rhodesian Bush War by providing training and arms; after the war, he had provided training for Zimbabwean air force pilots. The spokesman said that &quot;not many countries have shown such commitment to us&quot;.

Following an appeal on 26 May 2008, Mengistu was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by Ethiopia&#x27;s High Court, overturning his previous sentence of life imprisonment. Twenty-three of his most senior aides also received death sentences that were commuted on 1 June 2011. As of 4 October 2011, 16 former Mengistu officials have been released from prison on parole, due to their old age and good behavior while incarcerated. However, Mengistu&#x27;s sentence remained unchanged.

==Memoirs==
In 2010, Mengistu announced the publication of his memoirs. In early 2012, a manuscript of the memoir, entitled &quot;Tiglatchin&quot; (&quot;Our Struggle&quot; in Amharic), was leaked onto the internet. Some months later the first leaked volume was published in the United States, and in 2016 the second volume followed. This time it was published in Ethiopia. Mengistu accused the remnants of the EPRP of leaking the first volume to sabotage his publication.

==Personal life==
Mengistu married Wubanchi Bishaw in 1968. They have a son, Andinet, and daughters, Tigist and Timihirt. Mengistu has resided in Zimbabwe, due to his friendship with Robert Mugabe, since 1991.

<doc id="160235" wikidata="Q232916" url="?curid=160235" title="Abraham Ortelius">
<text>Abraham Ortelius (; also Ortels, Orthellius, Wortels; 4 or 14 April 152728 June 1598) was a cartographer, geographer, and cosmographer from Antwerp in the Spanish Netherlands. He is recognized as the creator of the first modern atlas, the (&quot;Theatre of the World&quot;). Along with Gemma Frisius and Gerardus Mercator, Ortelius is generally considered one of the founders of the Netherlandish school of cartography and geography. He was a notable figure of this school in its golden age (approximately 1570s–1670s) and an important geographer of Spain during the age of discovery. The publication of his atlas in 1570 is often considered as the official beginning of the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography. He was the first person proposing that the continents were joined before drifting to their present positions.

==Life==
Abraham Ortelius was born on either 4 April or 14 April 1527 in the city of Antwerp, which was then in the Spanish Netherlands. The Ortels or Wortels (latinized as Orthellius and Ortelius) family was originally from Augsburg, a Free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. Abraham&#x27;s grandfather, Willem Ortels, was a pharmacist. He had moved in 1460 to Antwerp where he married Mathilde &#x27;s Jagers, alias Reynaerts. They had five children: Imbert who inherited his father&#x27;s pharmacy, Anna, Odille (or Ottilia of Odilia), who married Nicolaes van der Voorden, a merchant in Brussels, and, in her second marriage, Jacobus van Meteren from Breda, who was a Protestant and supervised the printing of English versions of the bible in England, Leonard (born in 1500 and father of Abraham Ortelius) and Josef. From his second marriage with Maria Antheard a son called Willem was born. The family lived in the Kipdorp street in Antwerp and was fairly well off. Leonard Ortelius married Anna Herwayers and they had three children, Abraham, Anna who would stay on her brother&#x27;s side and Elisabeth who married a trader named Jacob Cool Sr., whose son Jacob Cool Jr. (known as Ortelianus) would be the principal heir of Abraham Ortelius.

Leonard Ortelius was well educated. He spoke Greek and Latin, and worked with his brother-in-law Jacob van Meteren on the translation of Miles Coverdale&#x27;s English Bible. In 1535, they were both prosecuted for possessing suspicious books. Searches turned up nothing and the case was subsequently dismissed. Leonard Ortelius was a successful antique dealer. Following the death of his father, Abraham Ortelius&#x27; uncle Jacobus van Meteren returned from exile in England to take care of him. Abraham remained close to his cousin Emanuel van Meteren, who would later move to London. In 1575 Abraham was appointed geographer to the king of Spain, Philip II, on the recommendation of Arias Montanus, who vouched for his orthodoxy.

He traveled extensively in Europe and is specifically known to have traveled throughout the Habsburg Netherlands; in southern, western, northern, and eastern Germany (e.g., 1560, 1575–1576); France (1559–1560); England and Ireland (1576); and Italy (1578, and perhaps two or three times between 1550 and 1558).

Beginning as a map-engraver, in 1547 he entered the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as an illuminator of maps. He supplemented his income trading in books, prints, and maps, and his journeys included annual visits to the Frankfurt book and print fair, where he met Gerardus Mercator in 1554. In 1560, however, when travelling with Mercator to Trier, Lorraine, and Poitiers, he seems to have been attracted, largely by Mercator&#x27;s influence, towards the career of a scientific geographer. He died in Antwerp.

==Map publisher==
In 1564, he published his first map, &quot;Typus Orbis Terrarum&quot;, an eight-leaved wall map of the world, on which he identified the &quot;Regio Patalis&quot; with &quot;Locach&quot; as a northward extension of the &quot;Terra Australis&quot;, reaching as far as New Guinea. This map subsequently appeared in reduced form in the &quot;Terrarum&quot; (the only extant copy is now at Basel University Library). He also published a two-sheet map of Egypt in 1565, a plan of the Brittenburg castle on the coast of the Netherlands in 1568, an eight-sheet map of Asia in 1567, and a six-sheet map of Spain before the appearance of his atlas.

In England Ortelius&#x27;s contacts included William Camden, Richard Hakluyt, Thomas Penny, Puritan controversialist William Charke, and Humphrey Llwyd, who would contribute the map of England and Wales to Ortelius&#x27;s 1573 edition of the &quot;Theatrum&quot;.

In 1578, he laid the basis of a critical treatment of ancient geography by his &quot;Synonymia geographica&quot; (issued by the Plantin Press at Antwerp and republished in expanded form as &quot;Thesaurus geographicus&quot; in 1587 and again expanded in 1596; in the last edition, Ortelius considers the possibility of continental drift, a hypothesis that would be proved correct only centuries later).

In 1596, he received a presentation from Antwerp, similar to that afterwards bestowed on Peter Paul Rubens. His death on 28 June 1598 and his burial in the church of St. Michael&#x27;s Abbey, Antwerp, were marked by public mourning. The inscription on his tombstone reads: &quot;Quietis cultor sine lite, uxore, prole&quot; (&quot;served quietly, without accusation, wife, and offspring&quot;).

===&quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot;===
On 20 May 1570, Gilles Coppens de Diest at Antwerp issued Ortelius&#x27;s , the &quot;first modern atlas&quot; (of 53 maps). Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French, and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; twenty-five editions came out before Ortelius&#x27;s death in 1598; and several others were published subsequently, for the atlas continued to be in demand until about 1612. Most of the maps were admittedly reproductions (a list of 87 authors is given in the first &quot;Theatrum&quot; by Ortelius himself, growing to 183 names in the 1601 Latin edition), and many discrepancies of delineation or nomenclature occur. Errors, of course, abound, both in general conceptions and in detail; thus South America is initially very faulty in outline, but corrected in the 1587 French edition, and in Scotland, the Grampians lie between the Forth and the Clyde; but, taken as a whole, this atlas with its accompanying text was a monument of rare erudition and industry. Its immediate precursor and prototype was a collection of thirty-eight maps of European lands, and of Asia, Africa, Tartary, and Egypt, gathered together by the wealth and enterprise, and through the agents, of Ortelius&#x27;s friend and patron, Gillis Hooftman (1521–1581), lord of Cleydael and Aertselaar: most of these were printed in Rome, eight or nine only in the Southern Netherlands.
In 1573, Ortelius published seventeen supplementary maps under the title &quot;Additamentum Theatri Orbis Terrarum&quot;. Four more Additamenta were to follow, the last one appearing in 1597. He also had a keen interest in and formed a fine collection of coins, medals and antiques, and this resulted in the book (also in 1573, published by Philippe Galle of Antwerp) &quot;Deorum dearumque capita ... ex Museo Ortelii&quot; (&quot;Heads of the gods and goddesses... from the Ortelius Museum&quot;); reprinted in 1582, 1602, 1612, 1680, 1683 and finally in 1699 by Gronovius, &quot;Thesaurus Graecarum Antiquitatum&quot; (&quot;Treasury of Greek Antiquities&quot;, vol. vii).

The inspired a six-volume work titled &quot;Civitates orbis terrarum&quot;, edited by Georg Braun and illustrated by Frans Hogenberg with the assistance of Ortelius himself, who visited England to see his friend John Dee in Mortlake in 1577, and Braun tells of Ortelius putting pebbles in cracks in Temple Church, Bristol, being crushed by the vibration of the bells.

===Later maps===

In 1579, Ortelius brought out his &quot;Nomenclator Ptolemaicus&quot; and started his &quot;Parergon&quot; (a series of maps illustrating ancient history, sacred and secular). He also published &quot;Itinerarium per nonnullas Galliae Belgicae partes&quot; (at the Plantin press in 1584, and reprinted in 1630, 1661 in Hegenitius, Itin. Frisio-Hoil., in 1667 by Verbiest, and finally in 1757 in Leuven), a record of a journey in Belgium and the Rhineland made in 1575. In 1589 he published Maris Pacifici, the first dedicated map of the Pacific to be printed. Among his last works were an edition of Caesar (&quot;C. I. Caesaris omnia quae extant&quot;, Leiden, Raphelingen, 1593), and the &quot;Aurei saeculi imago, sive Germanorum veterum vita, mores, ritus et religio.&quot; (Philippe Galle, Antwerp, 1596). He also aided Welser in his edition of the Peutinger Table in 1598.

Contrary to popular belief, Abraham Ortelius, who had no children, never lived at the &quot;Mercator-Orteliushuis&quot; (Kloosterstraat 11–17, Antwerpen), but lived at his sister&#x27;s house (Kloosterstraat 33–35, Antwerpen).

==Modern use of maps==
Originals of Ortelius&#x27;s maps are popular collectors&#x27; items and often sell for tens of thousands of dollars. Facsimiles of his maps are also available from many retailers. A map he made of North and South America is also included in the world&#x27;s largest commercially available jigsaw puzzle, which is of four world maps. This puzzle is made by Ravensburger, measures × , and has over 18,000 pieces.

==Imagining continental drift==
Ortelius was the first to underline the geometrical similarity between the coasts of America and Europe-Africa and to propose continental drift as an explanation. Kious described Ortelius&#x27;s thoughts in this way:

Ortelius&#x27;s observations of continental juxtaposition and his proposal of rupture and separation went unnoticed until the late 20th century. However, they were repeated in the 18th and 19th centuries (for example, Antonio Snider-Pellegrini) and later by Alfred Wegener, who published his hypothesis of continental drift in 1912 and in following years. Because his publications were widely available in German and English and because he adduced geological support for the idea, Wegener is credited by most geologists as the first to recognize the possibility of continental drift. Frank Bursley Taylor (in 1908) was also an early advocate of continental drift. During the 1960s geophysical and geological evidence for seafloor spreading at mid-oceanic ridges became increasingly compelling to geologists (e.g. Harry H. Hess, 1960) and finally established continental drift as an ongoing global mechanism (e.g. by the work of W. Jason Morgan by 1967 and Dan McKenzie in 1968). After more than three centuries, Ortelius&#x27;s supposition of continental drift was vindicated.

<text> (, &quot;Theatre of the Lands of the World&quot;) is considered to be the first true modern atlas. Written by Abraham Ortelius, strongly encouraged by Gillis Hooftman and originally printed on 20 May 1570 in Antwerp, it consisted of a collection of uniform map sheets and supporting text bound to form a book for which copper printing plates were specifically engraved. The Ortelius atlas is sometimes referred to as the summary of sixteenth-century cartography. The publication of the (1570) is often considered as the official beginning of the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography (approximately 1570s–1670s).

==Contents==
The atlas contained virtually no maps from the hand of Ortelius, but 53 bundled maps of other masters, with the source as indicated. Previously, groupings of disparate maps were only released as custom lots, to individual order. In the Ortelius atlas, however, the maps were all in the same style and of the same size, printed from copper plates, logically arranged by continent, region and state. In addition to the maps he provided a descriptive comment and referrals on the reverse. This was the first time that the entirety of Western European knowledge of the world was brought together in one book.

In the bibliography, in the section &#x27;Catalogus Auctorum&#x27;, not only were the 33 cartographers mentioned whose work was recorded in the Theatrum (which at the time was not yet customary), but also the total of 87 cartographers of the 16th century that Ortelius knew. This list grew in every Latin Edition, and included no less than 183 names in 1601. Among the sources the following are mentioned: for the world map, the &quot;World Map&quot; (1561) by Giacomo Gastaldi; the &quot;porto Avenue of the Atlantic coast&quot; (1562) by Diego Gutierrez, the &quot;world map&quot; (1569) of Gerardus Mercator, which have eight maps derived from the Theatrum.

For the map of Europe, &quot;wall map&quot; (1554). of the Mercator &quot;map of Scandinavia&quot; (1539) by Olaus Magnus, map of Asia was derived from his own &quot;Asia-map&quot; from 1567, which in turn was inspired by that of Gastaldi (1559). Also for the Africa map he referred to Gastaldi.

This work by Ortelius, consisted of a collection of the best maps, refined by himself, combined into one map or split across multiple, and on the same size (folios of approximately 35 x 50 cm). The naming and location coordinates were not normalized.

==Editions==
After the initial publication of , Ortelius regularly revised and expanded the atlas, reissuing it in various formats until his death in 1598. From its original seventy maps and eighty-seven bibliographic references in the first edition (1570), the atlas grew through its thirty-one editions to encompass 183 references and 167 maps in 1612.

The online copy of the 1573 volume held by the State Library of New South Wales contains 70 numbered double-page sheets, tipped onto stubs at the centerfold, with six maps combined with descriptive letterpress on the recto of each first leaf. The legends of most maps name the author whose map Ortelius adapted. In the preface Ortelius credits Franciscus Hogenberg with engraving nearly all the maps.

The 1573 &quot;Additamentum&quot; to the atlas is notable for containing Humphrey Llwyd&#x27;s &quot;Cambriae Typus&quot;, the first map to show Wales on its own.

 is used as the centerpiece of the Fool&#x27;s Cap Map of the World, which is a satirical presentation of Europe&#x27;s understanding of the globe.

From the 1630s, the Blaeu family issued their work under a similar title, &quot;Theatrum orbis terrarum, sive, Atlas Novus&quot;.

== Structure ==

All the editions had the same structure. They started with an allegorical title page, on which the five known continents were presented by allegorical women, with Europe as the Queen. Then a reference to Philip II, King of Spain and the Low Countries, and a poem by Adolphus Mekerchus (Adolf of Meetkercke). From 1579, the editions contain a portrait of Ortelius by Philip Galle, an introduction by Ortelius, in the Latin editions followed by a recommendation by Mercator. This is followed by the bibliography (&quot;Catalogus Auctorum&quot;), an index (&quot;Index Tabularum&quot;), the maps with text on the back, followed (starting from 1579 in the Latin editions) by a register of place names in ancient times (&quot;Nomenclator&quot;), the treatise, the &quot;Mona Druidum insula&quot; of the Welsh scientist Humphrey Lhuyd (Humphrey Llwyd) over the Anglesey coat of arms, and finally the &#x27;privilege&#x27; and a colophon.

The moneyed middle class, which had much interest in knowledge and science, turned out to be very much interested in the convenient size and the pooling of knowledge. For buyers who were not strong in Latin, from the end of 1572, in addition to the Latin version, Dutch, German and French editions were published. 
This rapid success prompted the Ortelius Theatrum to constantly expand and improve. In 1573, he released 17 more additional maps under the title &quot;Additamentum Theatri Orbis Terrarum&quot;, bringing the total at 70 maps. By Ortelius&#x27; death in 1598, there were twenty-five editions that had appeared in seven different languages.

<text>Dance moves or dance steps (more complex dance moves are called dance patterns, dance figures, dance movements, or dance variations) are usually isolated, defined, and organized so that beginning dancers can learn and use them independently of each other. However, more complex movements are influenced by musicality and lyrical relevance to express emotions or refer to a message. 
Dance moves tend to emphasize the concepts of lead and follow and connection.

In most cases, dance moves by themselves are independent of musicality, which is the appropriateness of a move to the music (for a notable exception, see Bharatanatyam). Generally, they are memorized in sets of eight counts. Also there are two different movements: concrete and abstract. These two movements show time, space, relationship, quality and focus. For example, relationship could describe the movement of two or more different dancers. The names of moves may be somewhat arbitrary and vary from person to person and city to city.

==Techniques==
&quot;A line dance is made up of a number of movements called &quot;steps&quot;. Each step is given a name so teachers can tell dancers to perform this step when teaching a dance. The most well known is the &quot;grapevine&quot; (or &quot;vine&quot; for short), a four-count movement to the side.&quot;

In ballroom dancing a &quot;dance step&quot; is defined as, or requires, the shifting of one&#x27;s body weight from one foot to the other in time to the music. &quot;Dancing is stepping in time to the beats of the music. ... In addition to steps, there are also dance movements, such as toe touches, kicks, and hops.&quot; Some genres, such as ballet, have, &quot;a clear repertoire of dance steps,&quot; thus different types of dance may be characterized by their differing and shared steps. Each dance emphasizes its own moves, but often moves are shared by several dances. The steps of a dance or pattern may be listed in a step sheet.

Dance patterns may be described by difficulty. Dance patterns may be described according to combinations of quick and slow steps and often by the rhythm or meter of the music, for example waltz steps (three-count step patterns danced to waltz music), swing steps (four-count patterns danced to swing music), polka steps (four-count patterns danced to polka music), and shuffle steps (four-count Texas Shuffle/foxtrot patterns). This may be because, &quot;dance patterns are choreographed to fit an even distribution of musical beats and measures.&quot; Moves may also be described by physical technique, for example most tap moves use landings in point/demi-point (weight on the balls of one&#x27;s foot or feet) positions with the knees tightly extended while in ballet jump landings are demi-plié (knees bent outward), most elements of Irish dancing occur in the sagittal plane. Different dance moves cause different stresses on different parts of the body of the dancer performing the moves, for example tap, Irish, and ballet moves cause repeated pounding to the balls of the feet while demi-plié jump landings cause shock to be absorbed through the knees as well as through the balls of the feet.

<doc id="160246" wikidata="Q16398" url="?curid=160246" title="Sherry">
<text>Sherry ( ) is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain . Sherry is a drink produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the Palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as Manzanilla and fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as Amontillado and oloroso. Sweet dessert wines are also made from Pedro Ximénez or Moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based sherries.

Under the official name of Jerez-Xérès-Sherry, it is one of Spain&#x27;s wine regions, a (DOP). The word &quot;sherry&quot; is an anglicisation of Xérès (Jerez). Sherry was previously known as &quot;sack&quot;, from the Spanish &quot;saca&quot;, meaning &quot;extraction&quot; from the solera. In Europe, &quot;sherry&quot; has protected designation of origin status, and under Spanish law, all wine labelled as &quot;sherry&quot; must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, an area in the province of Cádiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María. In 1933 the Jerez was the first Spanish &quot;denominación&quot; to be officially recognised in this way, officially named &quot;D.O. Jerez-Xeres-Sherry&quot; and sharing the same governing council as &quot;D.O. Manzanilla Sanlúcar de Barrameda&quot;.

After fermentation is complete, the base wines are fortified with grape spirit to increase their final alcohol content. Wines classified as suitable for aging as fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 percent by volume. As they age in a barrel, they develop a layer of flor—a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. Despite the common misconception that sherry is a sweet drink, most varieties are dry. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.

Wines from different years are aged and blended using a solera system before bottling so that bottles of sherry will not usually carry a specific vintage year and can contain a small proportion of very old wine. Sherry is regarded by some wine writers as &quot;underappreciated&quot; and a &quot;neglected wine treasure&quot;.

==History==

Jerez has been a centre of viniculture since wine-making was introduced to Spain by the Phoenicians in 1100 BCE. The practice was carried on by the Romans when they took control of Iberia around 200 BCE. The Moors conquered the region in 711 CE and introduced distillation, which led to the development of brandy and fortified wine.

During the Moorish period, the town was called &quot;Sherish&quot; (a transliteration of the Arabic ), from which both &quot;sherry&quot; and &quot;Jerez&quot; are derived. Wines similar in style to sherry have traditionally been made in the city of Shiraz in mid-southern Iran, but it is thought unlikely that the name derives from there.
Wine production continued through five centuries of Muslim rule. In 966, Al-Hakam II, the second Caliph of Córdoba, ordered the destruction of the vineyards, but the inhabitants of Jerez appealed on the grounds that the vineyards also produced raisins to feed the empire&#x27;s soldiers, and the Caliph spared two-thirds of the vineyards.

In 1264 Alfonso X of Castile took the city. From this point on, the production of sherry and its export throughout Europe increased significantly. By the end of the 16th century, sherry had a reputation in Europe as the world&#x27;s finest wine.

Christopher Columbus brought sherry on his voyage to the New World and when Ferdinand Magellan prepared to sail around the world in 1519, he spent more on sherry than on weapons.

Sherry became very popular in Great Britain, especially after Francis Drake sacked Cadiz in 1587. At that time Cadiz was one of the most important Spanish seaports, and Spain was preparing an armada there to invade England. Among the spoils Drake brought back after destroying the fleet were 2,900 barrels of sherry that had been waiting to be loaded aboard Spanish ships. This helped popularize sherry in the British Isles.

Because sherry was a major wine export to the United Kingdom, many English companies and styles developed. Many of the Jerez cellars were founded by British families.

In 1894 the Jerez region was devastated by the insect phylloxera. Whereas larger vineyards were replanted with resistant vines, most smaller producers were unable to fight the infestation and abandoned their vineyards entirely.

==Types==
* Fino (&#x27;delicate&#x27; in Spanish) is the driest and palest of the traditional varieties of sherry. The wine is aged in barrels under a cap of flor yeast to prevent contact with the air.
* Manzanilla is an especially light variety of fino sherry made around the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda.
* Manzanilla Pasada is a Manzanilla that has undergone extended aging or has been partially oxidised, giving a richer, nuttier flavour.
* Amontillado is a variety of sherry that is first aged under flor and then exposed to oxygen, producing a sherry that is darker than a Fino but lighter than an Oloroso. Naturally dry, they are sometimes sold lightly- to medium-sweetened (though these may no longer be labelled as Amontillado).
* Palo Cortado is a variety of sherry that is initially aged like an Amontillado, typically for three or four years, but which subsequently develops a character closer to an Oloroso. This either happens by accident when the flor dies or commonly the flor is killed by fortification or filtration.
* Oloroso (&#x27;scented&#x27; in Spanish) is a variety of sherry aged oxidatively for a longer time than a Fino or Amontillado, producing a darker and richer wine. With alcohol levels between 18 and 20%, Olorosos are the most alcoholic sherries. Like Amontillado, naturally dry, they are often also sold in sweetened versions called Cream sherry (first made in the 1860s by blending different sherries, usually including Oloroso and Pedro Ximénez).
* Jerez Dulce (sweet sherries) are made either by fermenting dried Pedro Ximénez (PX) or Moscatel grapes, which produces an intensely sweet dark brown or black wine, or by blending sweeter wines or grape must with a drier variety.

On 12 April 2012, the rules applicable to the sweet and fortified Denominations of Origen Montilla-Moriles and Jerez-Xérès-Sherry were changed to prohibit terms such as &quot;Rich Oloroso&quot;, &quot;Sweet Oloroso&quot; and &quot;Oloroso Dulce&quot;. Such wines are to be labelled as &quot;Cream Sherry: Blend of Oloroso / Amontillado&quot; or suchlike.

The classification by sweetness is:

==Protection of sherry==
Spanish producers have registered the three names &quot;Jerez&quot; / &quot;Xérès&quot; / &quot;sherry&quot;, and so may prosecute producers of similar fortified wines from other places using any of the same names. In 1933, Article 34 of the Spanish &quot;Estatuto del Vino&quot; (Wine Law) established the boundaries of sherry production as the first Spanish wine &quot;denominación&quot;. Today, sherry&#x27;s official status is further recognized by wider EU legislation, under which &quot;sherry&quot; sold within the EU must come from the triangular area of the province of Cádiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María. However, the name &quot;sherry&quot; is used as a semi-generic in the United States where it must be labeled with a region of origin such as American sherry or California sherry. However, such wines cannot be exported to the EU.

Both Canadian and Australian winemakers now use the term Apera instead of sherry, while consumers still use the term sherry.

==Production==
===Climate===
The Jerez district has a predictable climate, with approximately 70 days of rainfall and almost 300 days of sun per year. The rain mostly falls between the months of October and May, averaging . The summer is dry and hot, with temperatures as high as , but winds from the ocean bring moisture to the vineyards in the early morning and the clays in the soil retain water below the surface. The average temperature across the year is approximately .

===Soil===
There are three types of soil in the Jerez district for growing the grapes for sherry:
* &quot;Albariza&quot;: the lightest soil, almost white, and best for growing Palomino grapes. It is approximately 40 percent chalk, the rest being a blend of clay and sand. Albariza preserves moisture well during the hot summer months.
* &quot;Arenas&quot;: yellowish soil, also 10 percent chalk but with a high sand content.
* &quot;Barros&quot;: dark brown soil, 10 percent chalk with a high clay content.

The &quot;albariza&quot; soil is the best for growing the Palomino grape, and by law, 40 percent of the grapes making up a sherry must come from &quot;albariza&quot; soil. The &quot;barros&quot; and &quot;arenas&quot; soil is mostly used for Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel grapes.

The benefit of the &quot;albariza&quot; soil is that it can reflect sunlight back up to the vine, aiding it in photosynthesis. The nature of the soil is very absorbent and compact so it can retain and maximize the use of the little rainfall that the Jerez region receives.

===Grapes===
Before the phylloxera infestation in 1894, there were estimated to be over one hundred varieties of grape used in Spain for the production of sherry, but now there are only three white grapes grown for sherry-making:
* Moscatel: used similarly to Pedro Ximénez, but it is less common.
* Palomino: the dominant grape used for dry sherries. Approximately 90 per cent of the grapes grown for sherry are Palomino. As varietal table wine, the Palomino grape produces a wine of very bland and neutral characteristics. This neutrality is actually what makes Palomino an ideal grape because it is easily enhanced by the sherry winemaking style.
* Pedro Ximénez: used to produce sweet wines. When harvested these grapes are typically dried in the sun for two days to concentrate their sugars.

Sherry-style wines made in other countries often use other grape varieties.

===Fermentation===
The Palomino grapes are harvested in early September, and pressed lightly to extract the must. The must from the first pressing, the &quot;primera yema&quot;, is used to produce Fino and Manzanilla; the must from the second pressing, the &quot;segunda yema&quot;, will be used for Oloroso; the product of additional pressings is used for lesser wines, distillation, and vinegar. The must is then fermented in stainless steel vats until the end of November, producing a dry white wine with 11–12 per cent alcohol content. Previously, the fermentation and initial aging were done in wood; now it is almost exclusively done in stainless steel, with the exception of one or two high-end wines.

===Fortification===
Immediately after fermentation, the wine is sampled and the first classification is performed. The casks are marked with the following symbols according to the potential of the wine:
The sherry is fortified using &quot;destilado&quot;, made by distilling wine, usually from La Mancha. The distilled spirit is first mixed with mature sherry to make a 50/50 blend known as &quot;mitad y mitad&quot; (half and half), and then the &quot;mitad y mitad&quot; is mixed with the younger sherry to the proper proportions. This two-stage procedure is performed so the strong alcohol will not shock the young sherry and spoil it.

===Aging===

The fortified wine is stored in 500-litre casks made of North American oak, which is more porous than French or Spanish oak. The casks, or &quot;butts&quot;, are filled five-sixths full, leaving &quot;the space of two fists&quot; empty at the top to allow flor to develop on top of the wine.

Sherry is then aged in the solera system where new wine is put into wine barrels at the beginning of a series of three to nine barrels. Periodically, a portion of the wine in a barrel is moved into the next barrel down, using tools called the &quot;canoa&quot; (canoe) and &quot;rociador&quot; (sprinkler) to move the wine gently and avoid damaging the layer of flor in each barrel. At the end of the series, only a portion of the final barrel is bottled and sold. Depending on the type of wine, the portion moved may be between five and thirty percent of each barrel. This process is called &quot;running the scales&quot; because each barrel in the series is called a scale. Thus, the age of the youngest wine going in the bottle is determined by the number of barrels in the series, and every bottle also contains some much older wine than is stated. Sherry is aged in the solera for a minimum of two years. A large solera system may consist of scales that require more than one barrel to hold. The word &#x27;solera&#x27; means &#x27;on the ground&#x27;; this refers to the stacking system that was, and sometimes still is, used, with the youngest barrels at the top and the oldest scale, also somewhat ambiguously called &#x27;the solera&#x27;, at the bottom. Of late, sherry producers and marketers have been bottling their wines &quot;en rama&quot;, with only a light filtration, and often a selection of a favored barrel from a larger solera. Such sherries can be considerably more complex in flavour than the standard bottlings, and, according to many, are worth seeking out. In order to allow the sale of reliable average age-dated sherries, the regulating council has set up a system that accurately tracks the average age of the wines as they move through their solera. Two average age-dated categories are recognized: VOS (&#x27;Vinum Optimum Signatum&#x27; – 20 years old average age minimum) and VORS (&#x27;Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum&#x27; – 30 years old average age minimum).

Sherry-seasoned casks are sold to the Scotch whisky industry for use in aging whisky. Other spirits and beverages may also be aged in used sherry casks. Contrary to what most people think, these sherry-seasoned casks are specifically prepared for the whisky industry, they are not the same as the old (and largely inactive) butts used for the maturation of sherry.

==Storing and drinking==
Once bottled, sherry does not generally benefit from further aging and may be consumed immediately, though the sherries that have been aged oxidatively may be stored for years without noticeable loss in flavour. Bottles should be stored upright to minimize the wine&#x27;s exposed surface area. As with other wines, sherry should be stored in a cool, dark place. The best fino sherries, aged for longer than normal before bottling, such as Manzanilla Pasada, will continue to develop in the bottle for some years.

Fino and Manzanilla are the most fragile types of sherry and should usually be drunk soon after opening, in the same way as unfortified wines. In Spain, Finos are often sold in half bottles, with any remaining wine being thrown out if it is not drunk the same day it is opened. Amontillados and Olorosos will keep for longer, while sweeter versions such as PX, and blended cream sherries, are able to last several weeks or even months after opening since the sugar content acts as a preservative.

Sherry is traditionally drunk from a &quot;copita&quot; (also referred to as a &quot;catavino&quot;), a special tulip-shaped sherry glass. Sampling wine directly from a sherry butt may be performed with a characteristic flourish by a &quot;venenciador&quot;, named after the special cup (the &quot;venencia&quot;) traditionally made of silver and fastened to a long whale whisker handle. The cup, narrow enough to pass through the bung hole, withdraws a measure of sherry which is then ceremoniously poured from a head height into a &quot;copita&quot; held in the other hand.

Various types are often mixed with lemonade (and usually ice). This long drink is now called Rebujito. A similar drink in the Victorian era was the sherry cobbler, shaken and served over shaved ice.

==In popular culture==

Many literary figures have written about sherry, including William Shakespeare, Benito Pérez Galdós, and Edgar Allan Poe (in his story &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;).

Brothers Frasier and Niles Crane frequently consume sherry on the TV sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;.

In the UK television show &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, Jim Hacker frequently drinks sherry with Sir Humphrey Appleby and Bernard Woolley in his office.

Sherry, and Amontillado specifically, is heavily featured in season 3, episode 10 of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

Sherry is frequently mentioned in the novel &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, and plays an important role in the narrative: the spy Jim Prideaux is alerted to the presence of a double agent within his division when Russian KGB agents are able to correctly identify the brand of sherry that was consumed during a secret meeting of MI6 personnel.

In John Mortimer&#x27;s long-running &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; book and television series, Horace Rumpole continually complains about how various family doctors are served sherry by his wife Hilda when they visit. For example, in &#x27;Rumpole and the Boat People&#x27;:


The historic sherry cellars have given rise to a breed of Spanish dog, the Andalusian wine-cellar rat-hunting dog, and iconic bull posters used to advertise sherry.

The film &quot;Withnail and I&quot; features a much-quoted scene where the two protagonists are offered sherry by the lecherous Uncle Monty.

<text>The following is timeline of events surrounding the [[Toledo War]], a mostly bloodless conflict between the State of Ohio and the Michigan Territory in 1835–36, over a disputed region along their common border, now known as the Toledo Strip after its major city.

==Background history==

===1700s===

====1780s====
*1787: The Northwest Ordinance, also known as the &quot;Ordinance of 1787&quot;, established the boundary for possible future states in the Northwest Territory as &quot;an east-west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan.&quot;

===1800s===
*1802: Congress restated the Ordinance Line of 1787 as Ohio&#x27;s northern boundary, in the Enabling Act of 1802, which allowed Ohio to become a state. Ohio petitions to gain statehood, and the northern boundary is set by the Ohio constitution as the Ordinance Line of 1787 with one proviso: If the line intersected Lake Erie to the east of the mouth of the Maumee River, then &quot;with the assent of Congress of the United States, the northern boundary of this State shall be established by, and extended to a direct line running from the southern extremity of Lake Michigan to the most northerly cape of the Miami Bay.&quot; This laid the basis for the Toledo War.
*1803: Ohio admitted into the Union with an enabling act authorizing the inhabitants to set up a state government.
*1805: Congress created the Michigan Territory with the Ordinance Line as Michigan&#x27;s southern boundary.
*1809: Congress established the Illinois Territory.

====1810s====
*1812: War of 1812 delayed survey of the Ordinance Line.
*1816: Indiana admitted as a state, with a northern border north of the Ordinance Line, to allow the state some lakefront. Michigan Territorial Governor Lewis Cass renewed request for national survey. 
*1817: Edward Tiffin, Surveyor General of the Northwest and former Governor of Ohio, commissioned William Harris to rerun the line. Harris drew a line favoring Ohio&#x27;s claim to the Toledo Strip.
*1818: The state of Illinois admitted into the Union. The Michigan Territory was enlarged to include Wisconsin and part of Minnesota. Michigan pressed her claim to the southern boundary. At Lewis Cass&#x27; urging, President James Monroe ordered a new survey. John A. Fulton plotted the Ordinance Line a few miles south of Toledo.
*The situation was now more confused than ever. The Harris Line agreed with the Ohio Constitution, and the Fulton Line agreed with the Northwest Ordinance. The difference between the two was a wedge-shaped strip of land, wide at the Indiana border, wide at Lake Erie, and from west to east, an area of about and including the mouth of the Maumee river. This was, in effect, a no-man&#x27;s land between Michigan and Ohio, claimed by both.

====1820s====
*1827: The Michigan Territorial Council organized the wedge-shaped area into Port Lawrence Township.
*1828: The U.S. House Committee on Territories in the United States House of Representatives reported that the framers of Northwest Ordinance of 1787 intended to give every state created from the Northwest Territory equal accessibility to the Great Lakes, thereby supporting Indiana&#x27;s claim to a Lake Michigan outlet and Ohio&#x27;s claim to Maumee Bay. Congress, however, took no definite action in resolving the dispute.

====early 1830s====
*1832: Michigan Territorial Council petitioned Congress for an enabling act which would permit Michigan to call a constitutional convention. Congress refused the request because of the unresolved boundary dispute between Michigan and Ohio. Congress passed a law providing for a third survey of the Ordinance Line to be completed December 31, 1835. Andrew Talcott, captain of U.S. Army Engineers was commissioned to undertake the project, and the actual survey was made by Lieutenants Washington Hood and Robert E. Lee.

Eastern capitalists had invested heavily in Port Lawrence real estate mistakenly guessing that the area would enjoy commercial success due to the construction of the Wabash and Erie Canal hoping that it would terminate in Toledo instead of Maumee thus keeping their holdings in wealthy and established Ohio.

Michigan capitalists wanted Port Lawrence in &quot;their&quot; state. Two sizeable railroad projects were being initiated in Michigan and due to terminate in the Toledo area.

==1834==
*May: Congress turned down Michigan&#x27;s petition for statehood.
*June: The Talcott survey was reported to Congress. The Talcott Line practically coincided with the Fulton Line, thereby supporting Michigan&#x27;s claims to Toledo.
*Late June: Congress enlarged Michigan Territory to encompass Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and the eastern parts of North and South Dakota. Since 1818 Wisconsin and part of Minnesota were already considered part of Michigan. Two of Michigan&#x27;s first six counties, including Brown, were in what is now Wisconsin.
*July: Stevens T. Mason, age 23, became Michigan&#x27;s acting Territorial Governor. He called a special session of the Michigan Legislature to expedite Michigan&#x27;s admission into the Union.
*November: Mason stressed the importance of retaining the Toledo Strip. He wanted Congress to create the Wisconsin Territory and return Michigan to its natural boundaries. Mason wanted the Michigan legislature to press for statehood after that.

==1835==

===January===
*January 26: Acting-Governor Mason signs Enabling Act for Michigan to hold a constitutional convention on the second Monday in May 1835.

===February===
*February 6: At the request of Governor Robert Lucas, Ohio lawmakers passed a law extending the jurisdiction of their state over the disputed area.
*February 12: The Michigan territorial legislature responded. If Ohio would extend its control into the Toledo region, then Michigan would make it a criminal offense to do so. They passed the Pains and Penalties Act which fixed a fine up to $1,000 and/or up to five years imprisonment at hard labor. Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to be ready to strike against any Ohio trespasser.

===March===
Ohio passed a resolution confirming its belief in the Harris Line which had given Ohio the Toledo area. The Ohio legislature provided for a rerunning of the line to settle the controversy once and for all. Three commissioners, Uri Seely, Jonathan Taylor, and John Patterson, were to begin this project by April 1. Lucas called out the Ohio militia to be on hand, if need be, when the three commissioners arrived at Perrysburg on April 1—April Fool&#x27;s Day.

Mason was worried. John Thomson Mason, Governor Mason&#x27;s father and former secretary of Michigan Territory, advised his son to be slow to act and let Ohio be the aggressor.

Mason took his advice and wrote General Brown to hold off on any display of force. In reference to Lucas, his three Ohio commissioners and their guard, Mason wrote, &quot;Let him get on our soil, arrest him, strike the blood at once, disgrace him and his state, and end the controversy.&quot;

However, at the same time Mason wrote the General, he also ordered three additional units of the Michigan militia into readiness. Lucas was an enemy and President Andrew Jackson showed no sign he had any intention of interfering.

Mason received a letter from U.S. Secretary of State John Forsyth that Congress might use its prerogatives over a territory to force a compromise with Ohio if Michigan refused to bend on the Pains and Penalties Act. This so distressed Mason that he asked Jackson to remove him as Governor if neither the President nor his administration could support him in the boundary controversy. Mason thought Michigan was protecting itself against a law of Ohio empowering Ohio commissioners, under the protection of the Ohio Governor, to rerun an Ohio boundary in Michigan Territory. If Michigan could not act, who could?

Governor Lucas had every intention of proceeding with the rerunning of the Harris Line, but he was anxious that it be done peaceably. He encouraged President Jackson to appoint a commission to arbitrate the dispute.

*March 23: Mason dispatched Senator John Norvell to talk with the President. Mason was also upset by some inhabitants in the disputed area who wanted to belong to Ohio because of interest in the Toledo canal. Norvell would press for presidential action.
*March 24: President Jackson appointed Benjamin C. Howard of Baltimore, and Richard Rush of Philadelphia to serve on a commission to arbitrate the dispute.
*March 31: Lucas and the Ohio line-runners set out for Perrysburg.

===April===
*April 1: Michigan held elections for township officials in the disputed area.
*April 2: Lucas and the Ohio line-runners arrive in Perrysburg.
*April 3: Rush and Howard (President Jackson&#x27;s commissioners) reached Toledo. Both Ohio and Michigan had already created a situation for war.
*April 4: Michigan residents proceeded to the polls to elect delegates for the constitutional convention in May.
*April 5: Writing from Monroe, Howard indicated that all signs pointed to Governor Lucas’ determination to carry out his designs. &quot;He is very firm in his character,&quot; he noted. &quot;And though doing what nine tenths of the nation will hereafter pronounce wrong, yet will listen to no argument upon the point, because he says that his State has decided upon it and it is his duty to exercise her laws.&quot;
*April 6: Ohio held elections in the disputed area.
*April 8: The Monroe County sheriff and posse moved into Toledo and began arresting violators of the Pains and Penalties Act. The most publicized incident took place in the night. The Monroe contingent, numbering some thirty-five to forty persons, entered into Major Benjamin F. Stickney&#x27;s house and drove his two guests, George McKay and N. Goodsell, out of their beds, having first attempted to gouge out McKay&#x27;s eyes and having throttled Stickney&#x27;s daughter for sounding the alarm. They then carried the two to Monroe; had a mock trial; and released them on bail two days later. The alleged crime being interference with the arrest of Toledoans loyal to Ohio.

:One witness wrote, &quot;We are driven from our homes for acting under the authority of Ohio; our houses broken open in the dead of night; citizens taken prisoners, bound hand and foot, and tied to fiery horses, gagged that they may not alarm the rest of the citizens; the females too in the same house are treated with violence by being held and prevented from going to alarm the neighbors; and all this for saying to an individual, he need not obey the laws of Michigan.&quot;

:After the assault of April 8, two or three hundred Michigan horsemen, armed with guns and bayonets, moved into the city and dishonored the Ohio flag by dragging it through the streets of Toledo on the tail of a horse. Benjamin F. Stickney wrote, soon after the outrage: &quot;There cannot be a doubt that the generous Ohioans will turn out en masse to protect their northern border and restrain the savage barbarity of the hordes of the north.&quot;

:&quot;Note:&quot; Major Stickney was regarded as an ardent Ohio Patriot by the people of Ohio and as an overly verbose hypocrite by the people of Michigan.

:The outbreak of hostilities forced the Ohio officeholders elected on the sixth to make a fast retreat; likewise, the Ohio line-runners, who were unarmed and unprotected.
*April 10: Writing again from Monroe, Howard described the situation: &quot;Men galloping about - guns getting ready - wagons being filled and hurrying off, and everybody in commotion.&quot;
*April 11: The Ohio line-runners sized up their precarious situation. One of them wrote from Maumee, “We shall certainly be made prisoners.” They knew Michigan was resolved to enforce its right over Toledo.
*Mid-April: Michigan&#x27;s determination to enforce the Pains and Penalties Act put Governor Lucas into a fighting position, the rumor was carried to Michigan that any further incursion into the disputed territory would be met by force. Ohio was mustering ten thousand volunteers.
:Rush and Howard reported to the President and to both Governors the measures they considered necessary if Michigan and Ohio were to avoid war. 
#Ohio was to continue running the Harris Line. 
#The residents in the disputed area were temporarily to decide whether they wished to belong to Ohio or Michigan. This would be in effect until Congress made a definite decision at its next session.
#They suggested that Michigan not enforce the Pains and Penalties Act nor try anyone under its provisions until Congress had a chance to act.
:Mason would not listen. It would make it impossible to carry out his duties as territorial governor. The proposal allowed Lucas to extend jurisdiction over an area the Talcott Line had declared belonged to Michigan. As chief executive it was his obligation to defend the Territory against an aggressor. Force was legitimate within the American tradition. Congress had allowed the territorial government to pass the Pains and Penalties Act. As governor he could not interfere with the courts concerning those already apprehended under the Pains and Penalties Act; that would be “executive usurpation and tyranny.” He was “thwarted by circumstances beyond his control.” He would gladly be a peacemaker, but he was a governor first.
*April 25: Lucas stationed forty armed men with the surveying party and gathered a force at Perrysburg.
:Mason directed the Monroe sheriff and his posse to be on hand to arrest trespassers. He also dispatched a letter to former Michigan Governor, Secretary of War, Lewis Cass, appealing for federal intervention.
:The undersheriff of Lenawee County William McNair, mustered and armed thirty Adrian citizens as a posse to march with him against Lucas’ &quot;ten thousand.&quot;
:Late afternoon the Ohio surveyor and their guards ran their line to Phillips Corner (a small field located south of Adrian, Michigan) and, because of the approaching Sunday, pitched camp for a day.
:A spy sent by undersheriff McNair to discover the location of the line-runners spotted them. McNair was pleased to learn the Ohioans were close, for he had the necessary force to arrest them or to chase them across the border.
*April 26: About noon on Sunday the Michigan posse moved in on the surveying party. Thrown into a panic, the line-runners made a quick retreat for the border. A remaining party of nine Ohio guardsmen took shelter in a small log cabin on Phillip&#x27;s property and barricaded themselves inside.
:They were promptly surrounded by the posse and commanded to give themselves up. This they did after much delay. But no sooner had they lined up for arrest than their leader started a stampede for the woods. McNair&#x27;s men fired a volley over the heads of the escaping Ohioans, wounding none but capturing all. They took the prisoners to the Tecumseh jail. Six entered bail, two were released and one was retained for refusing bail on principle.
:The first shots of the war had been fired at the so-called Battle of Phillips Corner, a term sometimes used to describe the whole of the Toledo War.
*April 27: The line-runners arrived in Perrysburg. Despite their rapid nocturnal flight through the southern swamp, they suffered no greater injuries than the ruining of coats and trousers. Lucas moved his forces out of Perrysburg and into the disputed territory.
*April 29: Mason pointed out to Secretary of State, John Forsyth, that once Ohioans crossed the Fulton Line, they would be resisted by Michigan. (The Battle of Phillips Corner had occurred three days earlier.) Of course, it is one thing to decide to have a war and quite another to find people to fight it.

===May===
*May 1: Mason wrote to Howard and Rush indicating his willingness to let Lucas rerun the Harris Line if Ohio would do nothing to extend jurisdiction over the Toledo area once the project was completed. Mason would also deliver to the Ohio courts any individual Lucas requested. He would make these concessions out of regard for &quot;public sentiment.&quot;
:Lucas refused the peace offer. Secretary of War Cass was infuriated by Lucas&#x27; unjustifiable exercise of power. Cass asked Mason to temper firmness with moderation. Mason had more to gain by suspending the Pains and Penalties Act than by pressing his right to enforce it. Jackson’s paramount desire was to see the dispute settled amicably, quickly and, if at all possible, by the two governors themselves.
*May 2: Quiet returned to the border with the disbanding of the Ohio volunteer army. Monroe, Michigan was full of &quot;bustle&quot; and much excitement in getting ready for the impending war. The &quot;Michigan Sentinel&quot; of Monroe reminded citizens &quot;mustn&#x27;t take lightly the prospect of civil war in which brother takes up arms against brother.&quot;
*Mid-May: The Michigan Constitutional Convention met in Detroit.

===June===
*June 11: The Secretary of State warned Governor Lucas that if he renewed the running of the line without regard for the feelings of Michigan, he would create a crisis demanding presidential interference.
:Ohio&#x27;s response was unsettling. In a special session of the legislature, the delegates passed a number of laws enforcing the state’s jurisdiction over the Toledo area.
# a law provided three to seven years hard labor for anyone guilty of the &quot;forcible abduction of citizens of Ohio.&quot;
# a new county, to be named after the Ohio Governor, was to be formed from the disputed territory with Toledo as the temporary seat of justice.
# the legislature appropriated three hundred thousand dollars to implement these statutes and empowered Governor Lucas to borrow three hundred thousand more if he found it necessary.
# the lawmakers directed the court of common pleas to hold session there the first Monday in September (September 7).
:Lucas appointed a three-man delegation to meet with the President: William Allen, Noah H. Swayne and David T. Disney. Jackson acceded that Michigan discontinue proceedings and prosecutions under the Pains and Penalties Act, that Ohio be given complete freedom to run the Harris Line, and that neither side forcibly oppose the official jurisdiction of the other in the disputed area.
:Mason could not bear the suggestion that Toledo come under the concurrent jurisdiction of Ohio and Michigan. Michigan was fighting the war on the principle that the Ordinance of 1787 gave Michigan both complete possession of the disputed area and complete authority to govern it. This authority was derived from Congress.

===July===
*July 12: Fighting broke out on the border. The deputy sheriff of Monroe County, Joseph Wood, was commissioned to arrest Two Stickney of Toledo (son of Major Benjamin Stickney, younger brother of One Stickney; see above) for allegedly having resisted two Michigan officers by force. Two Stickney notified Wood that the day he set foot in Toledo his life would be in danger.
*July 16: (Michigan&#x27;s department of History, Arts, and Libraries says it was the 15th) The deputy sheriff attempted to carry out his commission. Stickney stabbed him in the left side with a dirk, saying: &quot;Damn you, you have got it.&quot; Wood was taken to the nearest inn for treatment and subsequently recovered. Meanwhile, fifty to seventy-five leading Toledo citizens, including Goodsell and McKay (former guests of Major Benjamin Stickney), gathered to pledge resistance against any further Michigan arrests, &quot;as long as they have a drop of blood left.&quot;
:Upon being informed of these developments, Mason immediately ordered the Monroe posse of about two hundred men into Toledo to arrest Two Stickney. When the Toledoans sighted the armed force, a large number fled across the Maumee River, some paddling their way to the other side on logs. Once safely out of the posse&#x27;s reach, they gave vent to their anger by firing on the intruders. Fonts of type of the &quot;Toledo Gazette&quot; were &quot;thrown into confusion.&quot;
:In the midst of this uproar Two Stickney escaped. The posse arrested three or four Ohio sympathizers, including McKay and Major Stickney. The Major, on the way to the Monroe jail, was forcibly held on a horse by having his legs tied under the animal&#x27;s body.
*July 18: Mason asked Lucas to allow extradition to Michigan of Two Stickney, a request the Ohio Governor refused on grounds the stabbing had taken place on Ohio soil. The Two Stickney episode removed the border controversy one step farther from an amicable settlement. The decision of Governor Lucas to hold out on Mason confirmed the Michigan legislature in its support of Mason.
*July 22: Secretary of State Forsyth in a letter to Cass regretted that Mason had submitted the controversy to the legislature. The matter could be resolved simply by the Governor himself. David Disney had said that Lucas was willing to abide by Jackson&#x27;s recommendations.

===August===
*August 3: General Brown informed Mason he had it on good authority that Lucas was raising an armed force “of some magnitude” in Toledo to protect the court to be held there the first Monday in September.
*August 16: Cass wrote that Forsyth had threatened Mason&#x27;s removal from office if the President&#x27;s recommendations were not followed.
*August 17: Mason appeared before the legislative council in defense of his position against Ohio. He could permit the rerunning of the boundary and suspend the Pains and Penalties Act. He could not recognize that Ohio had equal claim to the disputed territory. Especially since Lucas had mustered a force with the avowed purpose &quot;of murdering our citizens.&quot; The legislature stood firm behind Mason and chided the President.
*August 24: The Michigan Democrats nominated Mason for their gubernatorial candidate under the new state constitution.
*August 25: Mason ordered up either a force of 200 volunteers or, if that was impossible, the territorial militia.
*August 29: President Jackson removed Mason as Michigan&#x27;s acting Governor.

===September===
Mason&#x27;s first replacement, Judge Charles Shuler of Pennsylvania, refused the assignment. This left the Territory without official leadership during September, although Mason continued to function as governor in all but formal title. Jackson&#x27;s appointment of John S. (&quot;Little Jack&quot;) Horner of Virginia was never fully received by the Michigan citizens. Shortly after Horner&#x27;s tenure of office began, the people of Michigan elected Mason as their first Governor. Despite the potential awkwardness, there were no quarrels between Mason and Horner, who was able to work quietly to ease tensions between Ohio and Michigan and then focused his attention on the western portion of the Michigan Territory that was not included in the state. Horner became Secretary of the newly formed Wisconsin Territory in July 1836, leaving Michigan to Mason&#x27;s leadership.

Michigan was ready to meet the enemy. Consisting of about two hundred fifty farmers and townsfolk, the contingent sported broom handles for weapons and feathers in their hats for military insignia. The march to Toledo took four days.

*September 6: The Michigan troops pitched camp at Mullhollen&#x27;s, about from Toledo. They expected to meet Lucas&#x27; force the next day. Lucas ordered court to be held before daybreak. 
*September 7: Lucas&#x27; adjutant general, accompanied by twenty armed men, left Maumee at one o&quot;clock in the morning with the judges and court officials. Two hours later, in old schoolhouse, they conducted the business of officially opening court and making the necessary appointments. These brief proceedings were written on bits of paper and then deposited in the clerk&#x27;s high bell-shaped hat. The court and its escorts adjourned to a tavern to celebrate. Word came that they had been spotted by the enemy. The group made haste for the Maumee. On the run they discovered that they had been given a false alarm and the clerk had lost the hat. Two guards made their way back in the dark and retrieved the hat. After joining their companions and firing two salvos, the whole company returned to Maumee at six o’clock rejoicing in having deceived Michigan.
:Mason&#x27;s forces arrived hours later on foot, horseback and in boats. No Ohio soldiers were in sight. They stayed on three days and then were ordered back to Monroe for review by the Governor, unaware that Lucas had outwitted them. 
:With the disbanding of the Ohio troops, Mason was forced to order his own soldiers back to their farms and villages.
*Late Fall: The Territory proceeded to act as if it were a state. Michigan elected Mason as Governor and called the legislature into session. They elected John Norvell and Lucius Lyon as U.S. Senators and Isaac Crary as Representative.

===December===
*Congress refused to seat the three Michigan representatives, granting them only the privilege of observers.

==1836==
* January 18: Norvell and Crary wrote a letter to Mason pointing out that their hopes for rapid admission into the Union had disappeared. They were certain that statehood rested on the resolution of the boundary question in Ohio&#x27;s favor. By the end of January, the admission bill, along with the boundary issue, was locked in the judiciary committee of both Houses of Congress.
*March: When the bills were reported out of committee, it was generally acknowledged that to enter the Union Michigan would have to cede the Toledo Strip in exchange for the western two-thirds (2/3) of the Upper Peninsula.
*June: Congress reviewed the committee reports. 
*June 15: Congress passed an act admitting Michigan into the Union once it surrendered the Toledo Strip for the Upper Peninsula.
*July 25: The Michigan legislature put out a call for delegates to decide whether Michigan would accept or reject the Act of June 15. Governor Mason ordered another survey. The results confirmed the Fulton Line. At the end of September, after four days&#x27; deliberation, the delegates turned down the congressional proposal by 28 to 21. By the end of October, the second council of assent (dubbed the &quot;Frost-Bitten Convention&quot; by its opponents), had become a reality.
*December 14: After two days of debates, the Act of June 15 was submitted.
*December 27: President Jackson reported the action to Congress.

==1837==
*January 26: Andrew Jackson signed the Congressional bill officially admitting Michigan as a state in the union 2 years to the day after Mason signed Michigan&#x27;s Enabling Act.

==1915==
The official survey of the line was finished and the governors shook hands over the border.

==1973==
*February 22: The United States Supreme Court sides with Ohio on a dispute over the eastern boundary of the Toledo Strip within Lake Erie.

<doc id="160255" wikidata="Q1665886" url="?curid=160255" title="Interactive proof system">
<text>In computational complexity theory, an interactive proof system is an abstract machine that models computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a &quot;prover&quot; and a &quot;verifier&quot;. The parties interact by exchanging messages in order to ascertain whether a given string belongs to a language or not. The prover is assumed to possess unlimited computational resources but cannot be trusted, while the verifier has bounded computation power but is assumed to be always honest. Messages are sent between the verifier and prover until the verifier has an answer to the problem and has &quot;convinced&quot; itself that it is correct.

All interactive proof systems have two requirements:
* Completeness: if the statement is true, the honest prover (that is, one following the protocol properly) can convince the honest verifier that it is indeed true.
* Soundness: if the statement is false, no prover, even if it doesn&#x27;t follow the protocol, can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability.

The specific nature of the system, and so the complexity class of languages it can recognize, depends on what sort of bounds are put on the verifier, as well as what abilities it is given—for example, most interactive proof systems depend critically on the verifier&#x27;s ability to make random choices. It also depends on the nature of the messages exchanged—how many and what they can contain. Interactive proof systems have been found to have some important implications for traditional complexity classes defined using only one machine. The main complexity classes describing interactive proof systems are [[AM (complexity)|AM]] and [[IP (complexity)|IP]].

== Background ==

Every interactive proof system defines a formal language of strings formula_1. Soundness of the proof system refers to the property that no prover can make the verifier accept for the wrong statement formula_2 except with some small probability. The upper bound of this probability is referred to as the soundness error of a proof system. More formally, for every prover formula_3, and every formula_2:

: formula_5

for some formula_6.
As long as the soundness error is bounded by a polynomial fraction of the potential running time of the verifier (i.e. formula_7), it is always possible to amplify soundness until the soundness error becomes negligible function relative to the running time of the verifier. This is achieved by repeating the proof and accepting only if all proofs verify. After formula_8 repetitions, a soundness error formula_9 will be reduced to formula_10.

== Classes of interactive proofs ==

=== NP ===

The complexity class NP may be viewed as a very simple proof system. In this system, the verifier is a deterministic, polynomial-time machine (a P machine). The protocol is:
* The prover looks at the input and computes the solution using its unlimited power and returns a polynomial-size proof certificate.
* The verifier verifies that the certificate is valid in deterministic polynomial time. If it is valid, it accepts; otherwise, it rejects.

In the case where a valid proof certificate exists, the prover is always able to make the verifier accept by giving it that certificate. In the case where there is no valid proof certificate, however, the input is not in the language, and no prover, however malicious it is, can convince the verifier otherwise, because any proof certificate will be rejected.

=== Arthur–Merlin and Merlin–Arthur protocols ===

Although NP may be viewed as using interaction, it wasn&#x27;t until 1985 that the concept of computation through interaction was conceived (in the context of complexity theory) by two independent groups of researchers. One approach, by László Babai, who published &quot;Trading group theory for randomness&quot;, defined the &quot;Arthur–Merlin&quot; (AM) class hierarchy. In this presentation, Arthur (the verifier) is a probabilistic, polynomial-time machine, while Merlin (the prover) has unbounded resources.

The class MA in particular is a simple generalization of the NP interaction above in which the verifier is probabilistic instead of deterministic. Also, instead of requiring that the verifier always accept valid certificates and reject invalid certificates, it is more lenient:
* Completeness: if the string is in the language, the prover must be able to give a certificate such that the verifier will accept with probability at least 2/3 (depending on the verifier&#x27;s random choices).
* Soundness: if the string is not in the language, no prover, however malicious, will be able to convince the verifier to accept the string with probability exceeding 1/3.

This machine is potentially more powerful than an ordinary NP interaction protocol, and the certificates are no less practical to verify, since BPP algorithms are considered as abstracting practical computation (see BPP).

=== Public coin protocol versus private coin protocol ===

In a &quot;public coin&quot; protocol, the random choices made by the verifier are made public. They remain private in a private coin protocol.

In the same conference where Babai defined his proof system for MA, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali and Charles Rackoff published a paper defining the interactive proof system IP[&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)]. This has the same machines as the MA protocol, except that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &quot;rounds&quot; are allowed for an input of size &quot;n&quot;. In each round, the verifier performs computation and passes a message to the prover, and the prover performs computation and passes information back to the verifier. At the end the verifier must make its decision. For example, in an IP[3] protocol, the sequence would be VPVPVPV, where V is a verifier turn and P is a prover turn.

In Arthur–Merlin protocols, Babai defined a similar class AM[&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)] which allowed &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) rounds, but he put one extra condition on the machine: the verifier must show the prover all the random bits it uses in its computation. The result is that the verifier cannot &quot;hide&quot; anything from the prover, because the prover is powerful enough to simulate everything the verifier does if it knows what random bits it used. This is called a &quot;public coin&quot; protocol, because the random bits (&quot;coin flips&quot;) are visible to both machines. The IP approach is called a &quot;private coin&quot; protocol by contrast.

The essential problem with public coins is that if the prover wishes to maliciously convince the verifier to accept a string which is not in the language, it seems like the verifier might be able to thwart its plans if it can hide its internal state from it. This was a primary motivation in defining the IP proof systems.

In 1986, Goldwasser and Sipser showed, perhaps surprisingly, that the verifier&#x27;s ability to hide coin flips from the prover does it little good after all, in that an Arthur–Merlin public coin protocol with only two more rounds can recognize all the same languages. The result is that public-coin and private-coin protocols are roughly equivalent. In fact, as Babai shows in 1988, AM[&quot;k&quot;]=AM for all constant &quot;k&quot;, so the IP[&quot;k&quot;] have no advantage over AM.

To demonstrate the power of these classes, consider the graph isomorphism problem, the problem of determining whether it is possible to permute the vertices of one graph so that it is identical to another graph. This problem is in NP, since the proof certificate is the permutation which makes the graphs equal. It turns out that the 
complement of the graph isomorphism problem, a co-NP problem not known to be in NP, has an AM algorithm and the best way to see it is via a private coins algorithm.

=== IP ===

Private coins may not be helpful, but more rounds of interaction are helpful. If we allow the probabilistic verifier machine and the all-powerful prover to interact for a polynomial number of rounds, we get the class of problems called IP.
In 1992, Adi Shamir revealed in one of the central results of complexity theory that IP equals PSPACE, the class of problems solvable by an ordinary deterministic Turing machine in polynomial space.

=== QIP ===

If we allow the elements of the system to use quantum computation, the system is called a quantum interactive proof system, and the corresponding complexity class is called QIP. A series of results culminated in a 2010 breakthrough that QIP = PSPACE.

=== Zero knowledge ===

Not only can interactive proof systems solve problems not believed to be in NP, but under assumptions about the existence of one-way functions, a prover can convince the verifier of the solution without ever giving the verifier information about the solution. This is important when the verifier cannot be trusted with the full solution. At first it seems impossible that the verifier could be convinced that there is a solution when the verifier has not seen a certificate, but such proofs, known as zero-knowledge proofs are in fact believed to exist for all problems in NP and are valuable in cryptography. Zero-knowledge proofs were first mentioned in the original 1985 paper on IP by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff for specific number theoretic languages. The extent of their power was however shown by Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali and Avi Wigderson. for all of NP, and this was first extended by Russell Impagliazzo and Moti Yung to all IP.

=== MIP ===
One goal of IP&#x27;s designers was to create the most powerful possible interactive proof system, and at first it seems like it cannot be made more powerful without making the verifier more powerful and so impractical. Goldwasser et al. overcame this in their 1988 &quot;Multi prover interactive proofs: How to remove intractability assumptions&quot;, which defines a variant of IP called MIP in which there are &quot;two&quot; independent provers. The two provers cannot communicate once the verifier has begun sending messages to them. Just as it&#x27;s easier to tell if a criminal is lying if he and his partner are interrogated in separate rooms, it&#x27;s considerably easier to detect a malicious prover trying to trick the verifier into accepting a string not in the language if there is another prover it can double-check with.

In fact, this is so helpful that Babai, Fortnow, and Lund were able to show that MIP = NEXPTIME, the class of all problems solvable by a nondeterministic machine in &quot;exponential time&quot;, a very large class. NEXPTIME contains PSPACE, and is believed to strictly contain PSPACE. Adding a constant number of additional provers beyond two does not enable recognition of any more languages. This result paved the way for the celebrated PCP theorem, which can be considered to be a &quot;scaled-down&quot; version of this theorem.

MIP also has the helpful property that zero-knowledge proofs for every language in NP can be described without the assumption of one-way functions that IP must make. This has bearing on the design of provably unbreakable cryptographic algorithms. Moreover, a MIP protocol can recognize all languages in IP in only a constant number of rounds, and if a third prover is added, it can recognize all languages in NEXPTIME in a constant number of rounds, showing again its power over IP.

It is known that for any constant &quot;k&quot;, a MIP system with &quot;k&quot; provers and polynomially many rounds can be turned into an equivalent system with only 2 provers, and a constant number of rounds.

=== PCP ===

While the designers of IP considered generalizations of Babai&#x27;s interactive proof systems, others considered restrictions. A very useful interactive proof system is PCP(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), which is a restriction of MA where Arthur can only use &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) random bits and can only examine &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) bits of the proof certificate sent by Merlin (essentially using random access).

There are a number of easy-to-prove results about various PCP classes. , the class of polynomial-time machines with no randomness but access to a certificate, is just NP. , the class of polynomial-time machines with access to polynomially many random bits is co-RP. Arora and Safra&#x27;s first major result was that ; put another way, if the verifier in the NP protocol is constrained to choose only bits of the proof certificate to look at, this won&#x27;t make any difference as long as it has random bits to use.

Furthermore, the PCP theorem asserts that the number of proof accesses can be brought all the way down to a constant. That is, . They used this valuable characterization of NP to prove that approximation algorithms do not exist for the optimization versions of certain NP-complete problems unless P = NP. Such problems are now studied in the field known as hardness of approximation.

<text>MenuetOS is an operating system with a monolithic preemptive, real-time kernel written in FASM assembly language. The system also includes video drivers. It runs on 64-bit and 32-bit x86 architecture computers. Its author is Ville M. Turjanmaa. It has a graphical desktop, games, and networking abilities (TCP/IP stack). One distinctive feature is that it fits on one floppy disk.

== History ==
=== 32-bit ===
MenuetOS was originally written for 32-bit x86 architectures and released under the GPL-2.0-only license, thus many of its applications are distributed under the GPL.

=== 64-bit ===
The 64-bit MenuetOS, often referred to as Menuet 64, remains a platform for learning 64-bit assembly language programming. The 64-bit Menuet is distributed without charge for personal and educational use only, but without the source code, and the license includes a clause that prohibits disassembly.

Multi-core support was added on 24 Feb 2010.

== Features ==
MenuetOS development has focused on fast, simple, efficient implementation. MenuetOS has networking abilities, and a working TCP/IP stack. Most of the networking code is written by Mike Hibbett.

The main focus of Menuet has been on making an environment for easy assembly programming, but it is still possible to run software written in high-level programming languages on the assembler core. The biggest single effort towards high-level language support is Jarek Pelczar&#x27;s work in porting C libraries to Menuet.

The GUI at version 0.99 supports display resolutions up to (16 million colours) with window transparency. The OS has support for several classes of USB 2.0 peripherals. MenuetOS ships with the shareware versions of &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot;.

For disk access, MenuetOS supports the FAT32 file system. Write support is only possible to USB connected devices.

As of version 1.49.60, MenuetOS can be booted on UEFI machines as well using Easyboot.

== Distributions ==
===32-bit===
* Menuet32
* GridWorks &quot;EZ&quot; distribution (comprehensive 32-bit archive packages) (CD/HD Boots)

===64-bit===
The 64-bit main distribution is now proprietary. Several distributions of the 32-bit GPL MenuetOS still exist, including translations in Russian, Chinese, Czech, and Serbian.

<text>Maria Clementina Sobieska (; 18 July 1702 – 18 January 1735) was a titular queen of England, Scotland and Ireland by marriage to James Francis Edward Stuart, a Jacobite claimant to the British throne. The granddaughter of the Polish king John III Sobieski, she was the mother of Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;) and of Henry Benedict Cardinal Stuart (Jacobite Duke of York, later Jacobite claimant).

==Biography==

===Early life===
She was born Maria Klementyna Sobieska, on 18 July 1702 in Oława (Ohlau), Silesia, in Poland. Her parents were Prince Jakub Ludwik Sobieski (1667–1737), the eldest son of the Polish King Jan III Sobieski, and Countess Palatine Hedwig Elisabeth of Neuburg (1673–1722). Jan III Sobieski was famous for his victorious Battle of Vienna against the Ottoman Turks on 12 September 1683. Her older sister Maria Karolina (known as &quot;Charlotte&quot;) was the Duchess of Bouillon by marriage.
===Marriage===
Being one of Europe&#x27;s wealthiest heiresses from inheriting vast estates in Poland from her paternal grandfather, she was betrothed to James, Prince of Wales, the exiled son of James II and VII. King George I of Great Britain was opposed to the marriage because he feared that the union might produce heirs to James Francis Edward&#x27;s claim to his thrones. To placate him, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor (Maria Clementina&#x27;s own maternal first cousin) had her arrested while on her way to Italy to marry James Francis Edward. She was confined in Innsbruck Castle but eventually the guards were deceived and, with the help of Charles Wogan, Maria Clementina escaped to Bologna, where, for safety from further intrusions, she was married by proxy to James, who was in Spain at that time. Maria Clementina&#x27;s father approved her escape, declaring that, as she became engaged to James Francis Edward, she ought to &quot;follow his fortune and his cause&quot;.

Maria Clementina and Prince James were formally married on 3 September 1719 in the chapel of the episcopal palace of Montefiascone, Italy, in the Cathedral of Santa Margherita. Following their marriage, James and Maria Clementina were invited to reside in Rome at the special request of Pope Clement XI, who acknowledged them as the king and queen of England, Scotland and Ireland.

===Titular queen===
The Pope provided them with a papal guard of troops and gave them the Palazzo Muti in the Piazza dei Santi Apostoli in Rome to live in, as well as a country villa at Albano. The Catholic Church also provided them with an annual allowance of 12,000 crowns out of the papal treasury. Popes Clement XI and Innocent XIII considered James and Maria Clementina, both Catholics, the rightful king and queen of England, Scotland and Ireland.

The married life of James and Maria Clementina proved turbulent and unhappy. Reportedly, James initially had a favourable impression of her because of her beauty, while she disliked him because of his lack of it, as well as his passive nature. She befriended the governess of her son, a Mrs Sheldon, who became her confidant and favourite. On the other hand, she disliked the influence of James&#x27;s favourite John Hay of Cromlix and his wife Marjorie, and reportedly, she suspected James of having an affair with Marjorie Hay.

In 1725, soon after their second child&#x27;s birth, James fired Sheldon and appointed James Murray as the guardian of their sons against the wishes of Maria Clementina. She left him and went to live in convent of St. Cecilia in Rome with her favourite Sheldon and the rest of her personal retinue. 
She accused her husband of adultery, while he said it was sinful to leave him and her children. Upon the advice of Cardinal Alberoni, who claimed it was her only chance to gain support against her husband, Maria Clementina claimed that James wished to give his son a Protestant education. This claim secured her the support of the Pope as well as the Kingdom of Spain against James and the sympathy of the public when she demanded that James remove the Duke of Dunbar and the Hays from his court and reinstate Sheldon in her position. In April 1726, James granted her sons permission to visit her. The whole affair was seen as a scandal in Europe and reported about by anti-Jacobite agents in Rome. In May 1727, through the mediation of the duke of Liria, James removed the Hay couple from his court, and in January 1728, Maria Clementina and James reconciled in Bologna.

In practice, however, Maria Clementina and James lived the rest of their marriage separated: James preferred to reside in Albano, while Maria Clementina lived in the Palazzo Muti in Rome.
She was prone to depression, spending much of her time praying and submitting to religious fasting and other Catholic ascetic rituals, which is thought to have played a role in the fact that she never conceived again. Her sexual relations with James soon discontinued; they seldom dined together, and though they were officially reconciled, she preferred to avoid him outside formal occasions.
Maria Clementina did perform the ceremonial functions she had as Jacobite queen: in June 1729, for example, she gave an audience for Montesquieu. Her favourite Mrs Sheldon did not officially reside at the Jacobite court, but she provided her with a residence close to it, and kept her as a confidante. Her relation to her younger son was not close, as he was his father&#x27;s favourite, but she was close to their elder son Charles, who was his mother&#x27;s favourite: during an illness of Charles in 1732, for example, Maria Clementina tended to him despite the fact that he fell ill in Albano and she was thus forced to meet James.

===Death===
Her health was weakened by her ascetic life style and deteriorated as the years went by. Maria Clementina died at the early age of 32 on 18 January 1735. Her doctor named the cause of death as &#x27;scorbutic disease&#x27;, more commonly known as scurvy. She was interred with full royal honours in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. Pope Clement XII ordered that she have a state burial. Pope Benedict XIV commissioned architect Filippo Barigioni to design a monument for her memory, Pietro Bracci sculpted a statue for it, and it was erected 1742 in the Basilica.

==Issue==
Maria Clementina and James Francis Edward had two sons:

*&quot;Charles Edward&quot; Louis Philip John Casimir Stuart (31 December 1720 – 31 January 1788), aka &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;, married Louise of Stolberg-Gedern and had no issue; had affair with his cousin Marie Louise de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne and had issue; had issue with his mistress Clementina Walkinshaw;
*&quot;Henry Benedict&quot; Maria Clement Thomas Francis Xavier Stuart (11 March 1725 – 13 July 1807), later known as the Cardinal Duke of York.

<text>FASM (&quot;flat assembler&quot;) is an assembler for x86 processors. It supports Intel-style assembly language on the IA-32 and x86-64 computer architectures. It claims high speed, size optimizations, operating system (OS) portability, and macro abilities. It is a low-level assembler and intentionally uses very few command-line options. It is free and open-source software.

All versions of FASM can directly output any of the following: flat &quot;raw&quot; binary (usable also as MS-DOS COM executable or SYS driver), objects: Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) or Common Object File Format (COFF) (classic or MS-specific), or executables in either MZ, ELF, or Portable Executable (PE) format (including WDM drivers, allows custom MZ DOS stub). An unofficial port targeting the ARM architecture (FASMARM) also exists.

== History ==
The project was started in 1999 by Tomasz Grysztar, a.k.a. &quot;Privalov&quot;, at that time an undergraduate student of mathematics from Poland. It was released publicly in March 2000. FASM is completely written in assembly language and comes with full source. It is self-hosting and has been able to assemble itself since version 0.90 (May 4, 1999).

FASM originally ran in 16-bit flat real mode. 32-bit support was added and then supplemented with optional DPMI support. Designed to be easy to port to any operating system with flat 32-bit addressing, it was ported to Windows, then Linux.

== Design ==
FASM does not support as many high-level statements as MASM or TASM. It provides syntax features and macros, which make it possible to customize or create missing statements. Its memory-addressing syntax is similar to TASM&#x27;s ideal mode and NASM. Brackets are used to denote memory operands as in both assemblers, but their size is placed outside the brackets, like in NASM.

FASM is a multi-pass assembler. It makes extensive code-size optimization and allows unconstrained forward referencing. An unusual FASM construct is defining procedures only if they are used somewhere in the code, something that in most languages is done per-object by the linker.

FASM is based on the &quot;same source, same output&quot; principle: the contents of the resulting file are not affected by the command line. Such an approach saves FASM sources from compiling problems often present in many assembly projects. On the other hand, it makes it harder to maintain a project that consists of multiple separately compiled source files or mixed-language projects. However, there exists a Win32 wrapper called FA, which mitigates this problem. FASM projects can be built from one source file directly into an executable file without a linking stage.

== IDE ==
Fresh, an internet community supported project started by John Found, is an integrated development environment for FASM. Fresh currently supports Microsoft Windows and Linux.

== Use ==
Operating systems written with FASM:
* MenuetOS – 32- and 64-bit GUI operating systems by Ville Turijanmaa
* KolibriOS

Compilers that use FASM as a backend:
* PureBasic
* High Level Assembly (HLA)
* BlitzMax

<doc id="160261" wikidata="Q815814" url="?curid=160261" title="List of heads of government of Norway">
<text>This is a list of heads of government of Norway. In the modern era, the head of government has the title prime minister (). At various times in the past, the highest governmental title has included steward (), viceroy () and first minister ()

Until 1873, the King of the personal union between Sweden and Norway governed Norway through two cabinets: one in Stockholm and another in Christiania (now Oslo). The newly created Stockholm cabinet consisted of a prime minister and two ministers, whose role was to convey the attitudes of the Christiania cabinet to the Swedish King. The cabinet in Christiania was led by a steward (). For brief periods, the incumbent crown prince was appointed Viceroy of Norway by the King, in which case the viceroy became the highest authority in Christiania. Whenever the King was present in Christiania, however, he assumed the highest authority, thus putting the governor or viceroy temporarily out of charge. Likewise, when there was no governor, viceroy, or king present in Christiania (which was not unusual), the cabinet was led by the first minister, who was the most prominent member of the cabinet.

In July 1873, the position of governor was abolished after being vacant since 1856. Simultaneously, the post of First Minister in Christiania was upgraded to Prime Minister of Norway. Although the office of Norwegian prime minister in Stockholm still existed, the real power and influence over state affairs was moved to the prime minister in Christiania, while prime minister in Stockholm became the second highest cabinet position, responsible for conveying the government&#x27;s views to the King. When the union was dissolved in 1905, the position of prime minister in Stockholm was abolished.

== Stewards of Norway ==

The Steward of Norway, styled in Danish (&quot;riksstattholder&quot; in modern Norwegian spelling), meaning &quot;Royal steward of the realm&quot; (see Steward), was the appointed head of the Norwegian Government in the absence of the Monarch during the Dano-Norwegian union. As Norway was a separate kingdom, with its own laws and institutions, the position of Steward of Norway was arguably the most influential position for a Danish-Norwegian nobleman or royal to hold, second to the King.

== Split premiership (1814–1905) ==

=== First Minister (1814–1873) ===

:&quot;Prior to 1884, there were no organised political parties in Norway; the prime ministers were considered senior civil servants (&quot;Embedsmenn&quot;). They were appointed by the King and were not subject to legislative confirmation. All Prime Ministers before 1884 opposed the constitutional reforms proposed by the parliamentary opposition, and were in their time viewed as conservatives. The Prime Minister was subordinate to the Steward and Viceroy, and the First Minister was subordinate to the Prime Minister. The de facto head of government was the First Minister.&quot;

=== Prime Minister in Christiania (1873–1905) ===

:&quot;In 1873 the office of the First Minister of Norway was upgraded to prime minister, based in Christiania. The office of prime minister based in Stockholm continued, with responsibility for communicating the policies of the Prime Minister in Christiania to the King, making it subordinate to the office in Christiania. In addition, a separate Prime Minister of Sweden was appointed from 1876 onwards.&quot;


== Prime Ministers of Norway (1905–present) ==

In 1905, the union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved. Since then the office of the Prime Minister of Norway has been in Oslo, except for the years of Nazi-German occupation during World War II when the Norwegian government was in exile in London.

=== Prime Ministers of Norway (1905–1940) ===



=== Heads of Government (1940–1945) ===

Government sanction by Nazi Germany during the occupation of Norway. The Nygaardsvold exile government (1935–1945) is recognised as the elected government during the occupation.



=== Prime Ministers of Norway (1945–present) ===
