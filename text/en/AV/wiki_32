<text>The White Motor Company was an American automobile, truck, bus and agricultural tractor manufacturer from 1900 until 1980. The company also produced bicycles, roller skates, automatic lathes, and sewing machines. Before World War II, the company was based in Cleveland, Ohio. White Diesel Engine Division in Springfield, Ohio, manufactured diesel engine generators, which powered U.S. military equipment and infrastructure, namely Army Nike and Air Force Bomarc launch complexes, and other guided missile installations and proving grounds, sections of SAGE and DEW Line stations, radars, Combat Direction Centers and other ground facilities of the U.S. aerospace defense ring, such as the Texas Towers.

During the Vietnam Era, the company retained its position within the Top 100 Defense Contractors list (it ranked 87th in the Fiscal Year 1965, 77th in 1967, 73rd in 1968, 89th in 1969). Its production facilities, such as the Lansing Truck Plant in Lansing, Michigan, and the main plant in Cleveland were engaged in production, inspection, engineering services and maintenance of thousands of military/utility cargo trucks M39, M44, M600, and M602 series trucks, as well as spare parts, such as cylinder heads, diesel and gasoline engines with accessories.

==History==

Around 1898, Thomas H. White purchased a Locomobile steam car and found its boiler unreliable. His son, Rollin, set out to improve its design. Rollin White developed a form of water tube steam generator which consisted of a series of stacked coils with two novel features: the first was the coils were all joined at the top of the unit, which allowed water to flow only when pumped, allowing control of the steam generation; the second was pulling steam from the lowest coil, closest to the fire, which allowed control of steam temperature. This second point was critical because the White steamer operated with superheated steam to take advantage of steam&#x27;s properties at higher temperatures. Rollin White patented his steam generator, US patent 659,837 of 1900.




===White Steamer===
Rollin H. White patented his new design and offered it to, among others, Locomobile. Finally, he persuaded his father, founder of the White Sewing Machine Company, to allow the use of a corner in one of his buildings to build an automobile.

White&#x27;s brother, Windsor, who was a management talent, joined the business venture, followed by their brother, Walter, who became instrumental in the sales, promotion and distribution of the product. The first group of fifty cars were completed in October 1900, but none were offered to the public until April 1901 so the design could be thoroughly tested. Since the cars were being offered by the automobile department of the sewing machine company, White could not afford to diminish the reputation of the parent company by the introduction of an untested product.

In 1905, it became necessary to separate the automobile department from its parent company to accommodate the growth of the business and to physically separate them, as a fire in one could ruin both operations. On 4 July 1905, a racing steam car named &quot;Whistling Billy&quot; and driven by Webb Jay set a record of on the Morris Park Racecourse.
A 1907 White Steamer was one of the early vehicles in the White House when Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, allowed the Secret Service to use the car behind his horse-drawn carriage. In 1909, president William Howard Taft converted the White House stables into a garage and purchased four automobiles: two Pierce-Arrows, a Baker Electric, and a 1911 White. This $4,000 car was one of the last steam cars produced and proved a favorite of the President who used bursts of steam against &quot;pesky&quot; press photographers. The White Model M 7-seat tourer generated favorable press for the newly formed White Motor Company. Taft&#x27;s White Model M is currently housed in the collection at the Heritage Museums and Gardens in Sandwich, Massachusetts.

The last steam car was built in January 1911 as the company made a transition to gasoline-powered vehicles. The company continued to show them in their catalogues as late as 1912. About 10,000 White steam-powered cars were built, more than the better known Stanley.

In 2019 Mitch Gross and Chris Rolph drove a 1910 model MM 40 hp White steam car from Beijing to Paris, likely the only time such a feat has been done by a steam car. The journey of over 8000 miles crossed 12 countries, 7 time zones and included the first crossing of a major desert (the Gobi) by a steam car. 

The White steam car reentered popular culture in 2023 when comedian and classic car collector Jay Leno, while repairing his 1907 White steam car in his garage in Burbank, suffered third-degree burns on his face and hands when a fuel line sprayed him at the same time a spark ignited.

===Gasoline Models===
White companies&#x27; manufacturing facility expanded. The White steamer used unique technology, and it was vulnerable in a market that was accepting the internal combustion engine as the standard. White canvassed existing gas manufacturers and licensed the rights to the Delahaye design for the &quot;gas car&quot;, showing a chassis at an English auto show in December 1908.

===White Tractors===
Rollin became more interested in agricultural tractors, and developed designs for tractors derived from standard White truck parts. When the White Company was not interested in producing tractors, Rollin set out to develop his own designs and, with brother Clarence, eventually founded Cleveland Motor Plow, which later became Cletrac tractor. Cletrac was later purchased by Oliver Tractor Co, which in of itself was bought by White in 1960. the early 1920s, Rollin briefly produced the Rollin car to diversify the tractor company, but found it could not compete in cost versus price against much larger manufacturers.

White was successful with their heavy machines, which saw service around the world during World War I. White remained in the truck industry for decades.

===Truck Manufacturing===


White Motor Company ended car production after World War I to focus exclusively on trucks. The company soon sold 10 percent of all trucks made in the US. Although White produced all sizes of trucks from light delivery to semi, the decision was made after WWII to produce only large trucks. White acquired several truck manufacturing companies during this time: Sterling (in 1951), Autocar (in 1953),
REO (in 1957) and Diamond T (in 1958). White also agreed to sell Consolidated Freightways, Freightliner Trucks through its own dealers. White produced trucks under the Autocar nameplate following its acquisition. Diamond T and REO Motor Car Company became the Diamond REO division, which was discontinued in the 1970s.

A White Semi performed a role in the 1949 James Cagney film &quot;White Heat&quot;. This era was probably the peak of White Motor market penetration, with the substantial gasoline engined tractors moving a large part of the tractor trailer fleet.

White designed and (with other companies) produced the M3 Scout Car, the standard United States Army reconnaissance vehicle at the start of World War II. White also built the later M2, M3, M13 and M16 half-tracks.

In 1967, White started the Western Star division to sell trucks on the west coast.

===White Buses===
The White &quot;Model 706&quot; chassis emerged as the winner of a four-way competition with Ford, REO and GMC, held by the National Park Service in 1935 at Yosemite National Park. Starting in 1936, White produced 500 of the Model 706, specifically designed to carry passengers through seven of the major National Parks of the western US; bus tours were offered as most tourists arrived from trains before World War II. The distinctive vehicles, with roll-back canvas convertible tops, were the product of noted industrial designer Alexis de Sakhnoffsky and used bodies from the Bender Body Company of Cleveland. They originally operated in seven National Parks: Glacier, Grand Canyon, Mount Rainier, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion. After being retired from service in the 1960s, many buses were sold to private collectors and tour operators. The Skagway Street Car Company assembled a fleet of eight buses starting in 1987, naming each bus for the location from which they were acquired.

Today, Glacier National Park operates 33 of its original 35 buses, where they are referred to as &quot;Red Jammers&quot;, and eight (of an original 98) have been restored for renewed service in Yellowstone National Park. Glacier&#x27;s 33 buses were refurbished by Ford and TransGlobal in 2000–2002, while Yellowstone&#x27;s eight buses were refurbished by TransGlobal in 2007. Glacier has kept one bus in original condition. Yellowstone has five White buses in original condition, two model 706s and three older units as well. In addition, a private operator uses two of the White 706 buses originally built for Yellowstone for Gettysburg National Battlefield tours. One ex-Mount Rainier White 706 is on display at the Longmire Historic District.

The bus driven by Egg Shen in the film &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; into Chinatown, San Francisco is a White 706 which was later purchased by the Skagway Street Car Company. It was one of the eight sold to Xanterra in 2001; they were subsequently restored by TransGlobal for tours in Yellowstone. The character &quot;Ol Jammer&quot; from the Disney animated film &quot;&quot; is based on the White 706.

In addition to the National Parks touring buses, White built similar buses with fixed roofs for intercity service. White entered the transit bus market in 1937 with the 700 series, available in lengths. The longer model was produced through 1953, with an update in 1948 as the 1100 series.

===Company Culture===
During the time brothers Walter and Windsor White ran the company, it offered a library branch, a store which sold necessities at low cost, sports teams, and concerts by orchestras and jazz bands, as well as musical performances by the workers, many of whom were immigrants from Slovenia and Poland. The company also had picnics at Euclid Beach Park.

After Walter White was fatally injured in a traffic accident, management changed and so did the firm&#x27;s culture. Employees started one of the country&#x27;s first automobile unions. The Great Depression caused a drop in sales, forcing White to merge with Studebaker. However, White soon became independent again.

In 1935, Robert Fager Black became president, but workers were still unhappy, and they went on strike. Black negotiated with the workers who were striking, and he even got baseball equipment for them and let them play while on strike, so they would have something to do. Black learned people&#x27;s names, visited the plant frequently, and asked customers if they were happy with what they purchased. Anyone could visit his office.

Black brought the company back to where it had once been by World War II, during which the company supplied the military with much of its equipment. White ranked 54th among US corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. When husbands went to serve, wives took their jobs, and the work force totaled over 4000. Black provided the services the company had at one time, and helped employees get to work with carpools.

Black retired in 1956, still beloved by employees.

===Demise===

In 1953, White purchased Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Autocar Company. From 1951 until 1977, White Motors also distributed Freightliner Trucks. This took place under an agreement with Freightliner&#x27;s parent, Consolidated Freightways. White manufactured trucks under its own brands—White, Autocar, and Western Star—as well, leading to the company becoming known as the &quot;Big Four&quot; through to the mid-1970s. The Sterling nameplate, unused by White as long as the company owned it, went to Freightliner after the companies&#x27; split. It was then used by Daimler Trucks, who manufactured the former Ford heavy truck line under the Sterling name, from 1997 to 2008.

Sales dropped during the 1960s, and White tried merging with White Consolidated Industries, the original company that once made sewing machines, however the federal government blocked this deal. The company opened plants in Virginia and Utah, since they did not have unions, but this did not help. Semon Knudsen, former president of Ford, made the company successful for a time, but the decline continued. Later, the federal government approved a merger with White Consolidated, which feared being hurt by White Motor&#x27;s troubles. Mergers with Daimler and Renault were also considered. Production was somewhat limited as White did not have a lighter range (13,330 units built in 1978), leading to several attempts at linking up with various European manufacturers.

By 1980, White was insolvent, filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in the Northern District of Ohio on September 4 of that year. Volvo acquired most of the US assets of the company in 1981, while two energy-related companies based in Calgary, Alberta, Bow Valley Resource Services, and NovaCorp, an Alberta corporation, purchased the Canadian assets, including the Kelowna, British Columbia, plant, and the Western Star nameplate and product range.

In 1983, White emerged from bankruptcy reorganization under the name Northeast Ohio Axle Inc. (which would later be changed to Neoax in May 1986). In March 1987, Neoax bought the Fairfield Manufacturing Company (a maker of custom gears), and in March 1988, it acquired IU International Corporation (a Philadelphia-based conglomerate) through a hostile takeover. After acquiring IU International, Neoax sold the conglomerate&#x27;s trucking and food distribution units, only keeping the waste management division. In 1989, Neoax changed its name to EnviroSource, and in 1998, to Envirosource.

Volvo produced trucks as White and Autocar through the 1980s, while &quot;Western Star&quot; continued independently in Canada and the United States, although Volvo-White–produced high cab over engine models were purchased and rebadged &quot;Western Star&quot; for sale in the Canadian market through the early 1990s.

In 1988, Volvo and General Motors merged their heavy truck divisions in North America, creating Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation and a new brand of trucks, White-GMC. Western Star was sold to Australian entrepreneur Terry Peabody in 1990. In 1997, Volvo purchased the stake of General Motors in their joint venture and rebadged White-GMC vehicles under the Volvo and Autocar nameplates. Subsequently, Western Star was resold by Peabody to DaimlerChrysler and merged with its Freightliner subsidiary. Volvo dropped any reference to White or General Motors and adopted the Volvo Trucks North America name. Autocar remained a part of Volvo until 2000, when the brand was withdrawn from the market, and was subsequently sold to Grand Vehicle Works together with the Xpeditor low cab-over heavy duty product, which remains in production under the Autocar badge, the last vestige of what was once America&#x27;s leading commercial vehicle producer.

A former White subsidiary, White Farm Equipment, produced farm tractors until 2001. As of 2006, the only products made under the White name are a series of corn planters (made by AGCO) and lawn tractors (made by MTD Products).

<text>Liberty Hyde Bailey (March 15, 1858 – December 25, 1954) was an American horticulturist and reformer of rural life. He was cofounder of the American Society for Horticultural Science. As an energetic reformer during the Progressive Era, he was instrumental in starting agricultural extension services, the 4-H movement, the nature study movement, parcel post and rural electrification. He was considered the father of rural sociology and rural journalism.

==Biography==
Born in South Haven, Michigan, as the third son of farmers Liberty Hyde Bailey Sr. and Sarah Harrison Bailey. In 1876, Bailey met Lucy Millington who encouraged his interest in botany and mentored him. Bailey entered the Michigan Agricultural College (MAC, now Michigan State University) in 1877 and graduated in 1882 (he had taken a year off from study for health reasons). The next year, he became assistant to the renowned botanist Asa Gray, of Harvard University. This was arranged by a professor at MAC, William James Beal. Bailey spent two years with Gray as his herbarium assistant. The same year, he married Annette Smith, the daughter of a Michigan cattle breeder, whom he met at the Michigan Agricultural College. They had two daughters, Sara May, born in 1887, and Ethel Zoe, born in 1889.

In 1884 Bailey returned to MAC to become professor and chair of the Horticulture and Landscape Gardening Department, establishing the first horticulture department in the country.

In 1888, he moved to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he assumed the chair of Practical and Experimental Horticulture. In 1896, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1900. He founded the College of Agriculture, and in 1904 he was able to secure public funding. He was dean of what was then known as New York State College of Agriculture from 1903 to 1913. In 1908, he was appointed Chairman of The National Commission on Country Life by president Theodore Roosevelt. Its 1909 Report called for rebuilding a great agricultural civilization in America. In 1913, he retired to become a private scholar and devote more time to social and political issues. In 1917 he was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences.

He edited &quot;The Cyclopedia of American Agriculture&quot; (1907–09), the &quot;Cyclopedia of American Horticulture&quot; (1900–02) (continued as the &quot;Standard Cyclopedia Of Horticulture&quot; (1916–1919)) and the &quot;Rural Science, Rural Textbook, Gardencraft,&quot; and &quot;Young Folks Library&quot; series of manuals. He was the founding editor of the journals &quot;Country Life in America&quot; and the &quot;Cornell Countryman.&quot; He dominated the field of horticultural literature, writing some sixty-five books, which together sold more than a million copies, including scientific works, efforts to explain botany to laypeople, a collection of poetry; edited more than a hundred books by other authors and published at least 1,300 articles and over 100 papers in pure taxonomy. 

He coined the words &quot;cultivar&quot;, &quot;cultigen&quot;, and &quot;indigen&quot;. His most significant and lasting contributions were in the botanical study of cultivated plants. Bailey&#x27;s publisher was George Platt Brett, Sr. of Macmillan Publishers (United States).

==Death==

Bailey and his family are interred in a grand Egyptian Revival styled mausoleum of his own design at Lake View Cemetery in Ithaca, New York.

==Rediscovery of Gregor Mendel&#x27;s work==
Bailey was one of the first to recognize the overall importance of Gregor Mendel&#x27;s work. He cited Mendel&#x27;s 1865 and 1869 papers in the bibliography that accompanied his 1892 paper, &quot;Cross Breeding and Hybridizing&quot;. Mendel is mentioned again in the 1895 edition of Bailey&#x27;s &quot;Plant Breeding&quot;.

==Agrarian ideology==
Bailey represented an agrarianism that stood in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson. He had a vision of suffusing all higher education, including horticulture, with a spirit of public work and integrating &quot;expert knowledge&quot; into a broader context of democratic community action. As a leader of the Country Life Movement, he strove to preserve the American rural civilization, which he thought was a vital and wholesome alternative to the impersonal and corrupting city life. In contrast to other progressive thinkers at the time, he endorsed the family, which, he recognized, played a unique role in socialization. Especially the family farm had a benign influence as a natural cooperative unit where everybody had real duties and responsibilities. The independence it fostered made farmers &quot;a natural correction against organization men, habitual reformers, and extremists&quot;. It was necessary to uphold fertility in order to maintain the welfare of future generations.

According to Bailey, the American rural population, however, was backward, ignorant and saddled with inadequate institutions. The key to his reform program was guidance by an educated elite toward a new social order. The Extension System was partly pioneered by Bailey. The grander design of a new rural social structure needed a philosophical vision that could inspire and motivate. Bailey proposed a Society of the Holy Earth in his book, &quot;The Holy Earth&quot; (1915). He envisioned farmers and others rising to the task of stewardship of the land, forests, oceans and all creation. &quot;The Holy Earth&quot; has been recognized as an early text of ecological theology.

Bailey&#x27;s real legacy was, according to Allan C. Carlson, the themes and direction that he gave the new agrarian movement, ideas very different from previous agrarian thought. He saw technological innovation as friendly to the family farm and inevitably resulting in decentralization. He was scornful of the actual forms of peasant life and wanted to transform it by cutting the farmers loose from &quot;the slavery of old restraints&quot;. Parochial and communal social groups should be broken down and replaced by &quot;inter–neighborhood&quot; and &quot;inter–community&quot; groups, while new leaders would be called in &quot;who will promote inclusive rather than exclusive sociability.&quot; Bailey and his followers held a quasi–religious faith in education by enlightened experts, which meant suppression of inherited ways and substitution by progressive ways. It was accompanied by a corresponding hostility to traditional religion.

Bailey&#x27;s simultaneous embrace of the rural civilization and of technological progress had been based on a denial of the possibility of overproduction of farm products. When that became a reality in the 1920s, he turned to a &quot;new economics&quot; that would give farmers special treatment. Finally, after desperately toying with Communism, he had to choose between fewer farmers and farm families and restraint on technology or production. He chose to preserve technology rather than the family farms. After this, he retreated from the Country Life movement into scientific study.

Bailey&#x27;s influence on modern American Agrarianism remains determinative. The inherent contradictions of his ideas have been equally persistent: the tension between real farmers and rural people and the Country Life campaign; difficulties to understand the operative economic forces; the reliance on state schools to safeguard family farms; and hostility to traditional Christian faith.

== Palm studies ==
Bailey made significant contributions to the taxonomic study of palms. His interest in the plants reportedly stemmed from his inability to answer his wife&#x27;s questions about the plants during a family trip to Jamaica in 1910. After retiring as dean of the Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1913, he devoted the better part of three decades to finding, collecting, and writing about palms. He developed a detailed method of collecting palm specimens that included photographing the tree in its entirety, preserving flowers and fruits in alcohol, pressing flower clusters, and carefully folding sections of the leaves to fit herbarium sheets.

Bailey traveled extensively in search of palms and other plants. In the 1920s, he was often accompanied by his daughter and scientific collaborator, Ethel Zoe Bailey. Already in his fifties when he began studying palms, Bailey continued to collect into his 90s. He was frequently abroad on his birthday, March 15. Thus, he could recall spending his 79th in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, his 82nd in Oaxaca, Mexico, his 88th in Trinidad, his 90th in Grenada, and his 91st at sea on a small sailboat between Sint Eustatius and Saint Kitts. Friends and colleagues at Cornell hoped to hold a 90th birthday celebration for Bailey, and they did, but only after their guest of honor returned to Ithaca in May.  

When Bailey began studying palms, about 700 species had been identified. The number reached thousand by 1946, the rise due in large part to his intensive study of the family. Ill health finally forced Bailey to discontinue collecting abroad in 1949, at the age of 91. He continued to study, compare, and write about his palm specimens. His ultimate goal was to produce an authoritative guide to all palms, titled &quot;Genera Palmarum&quot;. When he died, he left behind a manuscript of the first page of the introduction. &quot;Genera Palmarum&quot; was ultimately published by Drs. Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield in 1987. A second, expanded, edition was released in 2008.  

==Legacy==
Bailey was awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1897.

Cornell has memorialized Bailey by dedicating Bailey Hall in his honor, as well as the LH Bailey Hortorium and Herbarium, a named professorship, and the &quot;Baileya&quot; journal. The Herbarium houses many of his palm collections, as well as an assortment of photos, a portrait, and several of his personal items including his desk. Since 1958 the American Horticultural Society has issued the annual Liberty Hyde Bailey Award. A residence hall in Brody Complex at Michigan State University, and an elementary school in East Lansing, Michigan, were also named after him.

With Rose Agnes Greenwell he discovered a Kentucky berry plant that he named &quot;Rubus rosagnetis&quot; in her honor.

In 1928, a tree (&quot;Sterculia foetida&quot;) dedicated to Bailey was planted at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Campus Arboretum, and is now listed there as an Exceptional Tree.

About 140 years after his birth, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Scholars Program was created at Michigan State University, the institution of higher learning where Bailey was both educated and began his career. The Bailey Scholars Program incorporates L.H. Bailey&#x27;s love of learning and expressive learning styles to provide a space for students to become educated in fields that interest them.

The Liberty Hyde Bailey Birthplace is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington (1678 – 14 December 1734), known as John Shute until 1710, was an English dissenting theologian and Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1715 to 1723.

==Background and education==
Barrington was born as John Shute at Theobalds House, near Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, the son of Benjamin Shute, a merchant, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Rev. Joseph Caryll. He received part of his education at the University of Utrecht between 1694 and 1698 and, after returning to England, studied law in the Inner Temple.

==Career==
Barrington was a Dissenter and in 1701 published several pamphlets in favour of the civil rights of Protestant dissenters. On the recommendation of Lord Somers he was employed to encourage the Presbyterians in Scotland to support the union of the two kingdoms, and in 1708 he was rewarded for this service by being appointed to the office of commissioner of the customs. He was removed from this position on the change of administration in 1711. In the meantime he had benefitted from the bequest to him of two considerable estates. One was left by a distant family connection, Francis Barrington of Tofts, whose name he assumed by act of parliament in 1710, and the other by an admirer John Wildman of Beckett Hall at Shrivenham, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). Barrington was now one of the leading dissenters.

At the 1715 general election Barrington was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed with another dissenter Grey Neville. In 1720 the King raised him to the Irish peerage as Baron Barrington, of Newcastle in the County of Limerick, and Viscount Barrington, of Ardglass in the County of Down. He was re-elected as MP for Berwick in a contest at the 1722 general election.

Barrington had become sub-governor of the Harburg Company, which was founded to conduct trade between Great Britain and Hanover. The company had authority to raise capital by lottery at Harburg and Barrington&#x27;s role was to obtain approval from Parliament to hold the lottery in England. Although he was told by Walpole and others that it was illegal and imprudent, the lottery went ahead. A parliamentary committee was set up to investigate, condemned the undertaking and concluded that Barrington had been guilty of &quot;promoting, abetting, and carrying on a fraudulent undertaking&quot;. As a result, he was expelled from the House of Commons in 1723. Some considered the punishment much too severe, and was thought to be due to Walpole&#x27;s personal malice.

In 1725, Barrington published his principal work, entitled &quot;Miscellanea Sacra&quot; or a &quot;New Method of considering so much of the History of the Apostles as is contained in Scripture&quot;,—afterwards reprinted with additions and corrections, in 1770, by his son Shute. In the same year he published &quot;An Essay on the Several Dispensations of God to Mankind&quot;.
Barrington stood again at Berwick at the 1727 general election and was defeated. He was confident of winning at the 1734 election, but Walpole decided to work against him. In the event Barrington lost by four votes.

==Death and legacy==
Barrington died on 14 December 1734. He married Anne Daines, daughter of Sir William Daines, in 1713. Their five sons all gained distinction. 
*William, the eldest, became Chancellor of the Exchequer; 
*John was a major-general in the British Army; 
*Daines was a lawyer, antiquarian and naturalist; 
*Samuel was an admiral in the Royal Navy; 
*Shute became Bishop of Salisbury and Bishop of Durham.
Their daughter Anne married the Hon. Thomas Clarges, son of Sir Thomas Clarges.

<text>Admiral Samuel Barrington (1729 – 16 August 1800) was a Royal Navy officer. Barrington was the fourth son of John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington of Beckett Hall at Shrivenham in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He enlisted in the navy at the age of 11, and by 1747 had been promoted to post-captain. Barrington had good connections and was lucky to enlist at the right time, and proved to be an able officer.

==Life==
===Early career===
Barrington went to sea in 1740. By 1745 he had passed the examination making him eligible for promotion to lieutenant. He was promoted to that rank in October 1746. His elder brother William, Viscount Barrington, was then a junior Admiralty lord, and pestered the First Lord of the Admiralty, the civilian John Russell, Duke of Bedford, to promote Samuel to the rank of master and commander, which was done in November. Next year, at the age of eighteen, he was made post-captain.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

He was in continuous service during the peace of 1748–56, and on the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War served with Admiral Edward Hawke in the Basque Roads in command of .

In 1759 &quot;Achilles&quot; captured a powerful French privateer, after two hours&#x27; fighting. In the Havre-de-Grace expedition of the same year Barrington&#x27;s ship carried the flag of Rear-Admiral George Brydges Rodney, and in 1760 sailed with John Byron to destroy the French Fortress of Louisbourg in Nova Scotia. At the peace in 1763 Barrington had been almost continuously afloat for twenty-two years.

He was appointed in 1768 to the frigate as governor to the Duke of Cumberland, who remained with him in all ranks from midshipman to rear admiral. Between 1772 and 1775 he accompanied Captain John Jervis to Russia where they spent time in St Petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at Kronstadt, and took a tour of the yacht designed by Sir Charles Knowles for Catherine the Great. The pair continued on to Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany. All the while Jervis and Barrington made notes on defences, harbour charts and safe anchorages. They came home via the Netherlands, the two once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information.

===American Revolutionary War===
In 1778 Barrington became commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station. While in post he organised the construction of Fort Barrington in Montserrat to enhance the defences of the capital Plymouth. Barrington and Jervis then took a private cruise along the Channel coast calling at various harbours including Brest and making and improving their charts as they went. Barrington and Jervis, later Earl St. Vincent remained firm friends throughout their lives.

On his return home, Barrington was offered, but declined, the command of the Channel fleet. He accepted the position of second in command of the fleet, under Admiral Francis Geary, in May 1780. The fleet patrolled far into the Atlantic, ensuring the safety of British convoys, preventing a junction of the opposing French and Spanish fleets, and capturing twelve merchant ships from a French convoy. The extended cruise caused an outbreak of scurvy and the fleet returned to England in August. Greary went ashore sick and Barrington assumed command. The Admiralty ordered him to return to sea with the fleet. Barrington refused to obey, which was seen as at least partially motivated by political machinations, and he was relieved of command.

After a change of government, Barrington was again appointed second in command of the Channel Fleet in 1782, this time under Admiral Richard Howe. After a summer of manoeuvring, mostly against the Spanish, the fleet sailed to relieve the siege of Gibraltar on 11 September. After successfully resupplying the garrison the British fleet of 35 ships of the line encountered a Spanish force of 46 ships. After some inconclusive skirmishing the British were able to evade them and returned to port. The war ended in February 1783.

As admiral he flew his flag for a short time in 1790, but did not serve in the French Revolutionary Wars. He died in August 1800.

==Legacy==
In 1794, James Colnett named one of the Galapagos Islands after Barrington, a name it maintained for centuries before being formally renamed Santa Fe Island.

<text>The National Motor Museum (originally the Montagu Motor Museum) is a museum in the village of Beaulieu, set in the heart of the New Forest, in the English county of Hampshire.

== History ==

The museum was founded in 1952 by Edward Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, as a tribute to his father, John, 2nd Baron Montagu, who was one of the pioneers of motoring in the United Kingdom, being the first person to drive a motor car into the yard of the Houses of Parliament, and having introduced King Edward VII (then the Prince of Wales) to motoring during the 1890s.

At first, the museum consisted of just five cars and a small collection of automobilia displayed in the front hall of Lord Montagu&#x27;s ancestral home, Palace House; but such was the popularity of this small display that the collection soon outgrew its home, and was transferred to wooden sheds in the grounds of the house. The reputation and popularity of the Beaulieu collection continued to grow: during 1959, the museum&#x27;s &quot;attendance figures&quot; reached 296,909.

By 1964, annual attendance exceeded the half a million mark and a decision was taken to create a purpose-built museum building in the grounds of the Beaulieu estate. A design committee chaired by the architect Sir Hugh Casson was created to drive the project, and the architect Leonard Manasseh was given the contract for the design of the building which was primarily the work of his partner Ian Baker.

By 1972, the collection exceeded 300 exhibits. In a ceremony performed by the Duke of Kent the new purpose-built museum building in the parkland surrounding Palace House was opened on 4 July 1972: the name was changed to the &quot;National Motor Museum&quot;, reflecting a change of status from a private collection to a charitable trust and highlighting Montagu&#x27;s stated aim to provide Britain with a National Motor Museum &quot;worthy of the great achievements of its motor industry&quot;. The opening of the museum coincided with the UK launch of the Jaguar XJ12 which made it an appropriate week for celebrating the UK motor industry. The museum is run by the National Motor Museum Trust Ltd, a registered charity.

An unusual feature of the new museum building in 1972 is the National Motor Museum Monorail passing through its interior. This was inspired by the light railway running through the US Pavilion at the Montreal World&#x27;s Fair, Expo 67.

Today, in addition to around 285 vehicles manufactured since the late-19th century, the museum has a collection of motoring books, journals, photographs, films, and automobilia of the world and is affiliated to the British Motorcycle Charitable Trust.

Vehicles in the museum collection range from the earliest motor carriages to classic family saloons, motorsport cars, motorcycles, and World Land Speed record breakers. A ‘Streets Ahead’ gallery displays cars, motorcycles and shop fronts from the 1950s to the 1970s. The museum’s In Focus gallery houses temporary exhibitions, some containing artefacts and media from the museum’s Collections Centre. Grand Prix Greats celebrates the history of Formula 1, whilst Road, Race &amp; Rally focuses on sports cars from rallying and hill-climbing. A recreation of a rustic 1930s garage contains artefacts, fixtures, fittings, tools and ephemera from the era. A multi-media display tells the story of British Land Speed record attempts and contains iconic vehicles such as the Bluebird CN7, Golden Arrow, Sunbeam 350hp, and the Sunbeam 1000hp. 

The &quot;On Screen Cars&quot; exhibit has a display of TV and film cars including Del Boy&#x27;s Reliant Regal as featured in the BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, Mr. Bean’s lime green Mini and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s Bessie.

Some of the cars used in various James Bond films were displayed in the Bond in Motion – &quot;No Time To Die exhibition&quot; in 2022. A Jaguar XKR Convertible used in the Bond film Die Another Day is part of the museum&#x27;s permanent collection.

The exhibit &quot;World of &quot;Top Gear&quot;&quot; showcased cars created and used by &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May, Matt LeBlanc, Rory Reid, Chris Harris, Paddy McGuinness and Freddie Flintoff from June 2009 until November 2024. The exhibit welcomed over five million visitors, showcasing both vehicles and props from the BBC series. It closed on 3 November 2024, replaced by a modern classic car display entitled &#x27;We had one of those.&#x27; .
The museum also hosts a collection of the well-known Rolls-Royce radiator mascots – the &quot;Spirit of Ecstasy&quot; – also known as the &quot;Flying Lady&quot;. The collection includes The Whisper, a figurine commissioned by John Walter Edward Douglas-Scott-Montagu, the 2nd Baron to his friend Charles Robinson Sykes who sculpted a personal mascot for the bonnet of his Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Sykes originally crafted a figurine of a female model, Eleanor Thornton, in fluttering robes, pressing a finger against her lips – to symbolise the secret of the love between John and Eleanor, his secretary. The figurine was consequently named &quot;The Whisper&quot;.

Additional attractions include the National Motor Museum Monorail, veteran bus ride, playground, restaurant and a substantial part of the Palace House and grounds, including the partially ruined Beaulieu Abbey. Among the monastery buildings to have been preserved are the domus (now used for functions and exhibitions), and the refectory, which is now the parish church.

<doc id="160688" wikidata="Q7240460" url="?curid=160688" title="Premium Bonds">
<text>Premium Bonds is a lottery bond scheme organised by the United Kingdom government since 1956. At present it is managed by the government&#x27;s National Savings and Investments agency.

The principle behind Premium Bonds is that rather than the stake being gambled, as in a usual lottery, it is the interest on the bonds that is distributed by a lottery. The bonds are entered in a monthly prize draw and the government promises to buy them back, on request, for their original price.

The government pays interest into the bond fund (4.15% per annum in December 2024 but decreasing to 4% in January 2025) from which a monthly lottery distributes tax-free prizes to bondholders whose numbers are selected randomly. The machine that generates the numbers is called ERNIE, an acronym for &quot;Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment&quot;. Prizes range from £25 to £1,000,000 and (since December 2024) the odds of a £1 bond winning a prize in a given month are 22,000 to 1.

Investors can buy bonds at any time but they must be held for a whole calendar month before they qualify for a prize. As an example, a bond purchased mid-May must then be held throughout June before being eligible for the draw in July (and onwards). Bonds purchased by reinvestment of prizes are immediately eligible for the following month&#x27;s draw.

Numbers are entered in the draw each month, with an equal chance of winning, until the bond is cashed. As of 2015, each person may own bonds up to £50,000. Since 1 February 2019, the minimum purchase amount for Premium Bonds has been £25. there are over 128.7billion eligible Premium Bonds, each having a value of £1.

When introduced to the wider public in 1957, the only other similar game available in the UK was the football pools, with the National Lottery not coming into existence until 1994. Although many avenues of lotteries and other forms of gambling are now available to British adults, Premium Bonds are held by more than 24 million people, equivalent to more than 1 in 3 of the UK population.

==History==
The term &quot;premium bond&quot; has been used in the English language since at least the late 18th century, to mean a bond that earns no interest but is eligible for entry into a lottery.

The modern iteration of Premium Bonds were introduced by Harold Macmillan, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his Budget of 17 April 1956, to control inflation and encourage people to save. On 1 November 1956, in front of the Royal Exchange in the City of London, the Lord Mayor of London, Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, bought the first bond from the Postmaster General, Dr Charles Hill, for £1. Councillor William Crook, the mayor of Lytham St Anne&#x27;s, bought the second. The Premium Bonds office was in St Annes-on-Sea, Lancashire, until it moved to Blackpool in 1978.

==Winning==
Winners of the jackpot are told on the first working day of the month, although the actual date of the draw varies. The online prize finder is updated by the third or fourth working day of the month. Winners of the top £1m prize are told in person of their win by &quot;Agent Million&quot;, an NS&amp;I employee, usually on the day before the first working day of the month. However, in-person visits were suspended, starting in May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.

Bond holders can check whether they have won any prizes on the National Savings &amp; Investment &quot;Premium Bond Prize Checker&quot; website, or the smartphone app, which provides lists of winning bond numbers for the past six months. Older winning numbers (more than 18 months old) can also be checked in the &quot;London Gazette Premium Bonds Unclaimed Prizes Supplement&quot;.

===Odds of winning===
In December 2008, NS&amp;I reduced the interest rate (and therefore the odds of winning) due to the drop in the Bank of England base rate during the Great Recession, leading to criticism from members of Parliament, financial experts and holders of bonds; many claimed Premium Bonds were now &quot;worthless&quot;, and somebody with £30,000 invested and &quot;average luck&quot; would win only 10 prizes a year compared to 15 the previous year. Investors with smaller, although significant, amounts would possibly win nothing.

From 1 January 2009 the odds of winning a prize for each £1 of bond was 36,000 to 1. In October 2009, the odds returned to 24,000 to 1 with the prize fund interest rate increase. The odds reached 26,000 to 1 by October 2013 and then reverted to 24,500 to 1 in November 2017.

, the odds of winning are 1/22,000; resulting in the expected number of prizes for the maximum £50,000 worth of bonds being 27 per year.

===Prize fund distribution===
The prize fund is equal to one month&#x27;s interest on all bonds eligible for the draw. The annual interest is set by NS&amp;I and was 1.40% , reducing to 1.00% . This was increased to 2.2%, then increased again to 3% and is now at 4% from January 2025. The following table lists the distribution of prizes on offer in the January 2025 draw.

==Economic analysis==

While the mean return is 4% as of January 2025, the median return is lower. For an investor with the maximum £50,000 invested, the median return is 3.45% (£1,725). For investors with lower amounts invested, the median return is lower. The typical investor with £1,250 or less invested will receive nothing in a year.

Premium Bonds are tax free, so are more attractive to higher rate taxpayers.

==ERNIE==

ERNIE - an acronym for &quot;Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment&quot; - is the name for a series of hardware random number generators developed for this application. There have been five models of ERNIE to date. All of them have generated true random numbers derived from random statistical fluctuations in a variety of physical processes. 

The first ERNIE was built at the Post Office Research Station by a team led by Sidney Broadhurst. The designers were Tommy Flowers and Harry Fensom and it derives from Colossus, one of the world&#x27;s first digital computers. It was introduced in 1957, with the first draw on 1 June, and generated bond numbers from the signal noise created by neon gas discharge tubes. ERNIE 1 is in the collections of the Science Museum in London and was on display between 2008 and 2015.

ERNIE 2 replaced the first ERNIE in 1972.

ERNIE 3 in 1988 was the size of a personal computer; at the end of its life it took five and a half hours to complete its monthly draw.

In August 2004, ERNIE 4 was brought into service in anticipation of an increase in prizes each month from September 2004. Developed by LogicaCMG, it was 500 times faster than the original and generated a million numbers an hour; these were checked against a list of valid bonds. By comparison, the original ERNIE generated 2,000 numbers an hour and was the size of a van.

ERNIE 4 used thermal noise in transistors as its source of randomness to generate true random numbers. ERNIE&#x27;s output was independently tested each month by the Government Actuary&#x27;s Department, the draw being valid only if it was certified to be statistically consistent with randomness. At the end of its life it was moved to Bletchley Park&#x27;s National Museum of Computing.

ERNIE 5, the latest model, was brought into service in March 2019, and is a quantum random number generator built by ID Quantique. It uses quantum technology to produce random numbers through light, replacing the former &#x27;thermal noise&#x27; method. Running at speeds 21,000 times faster than the first ERNIE, it can produce 3 million winners in just 12 minutes each month.

===In popular culture===
ERNIE, anthropomorphised in early advertising, receives Valentine cards, Christmas cards and letters from the public. It is the subject of the song &quot;E.R.N.I.E.&quot; by Madness, from the 1980 album &quot;Absolutely&quot;. It is also referenced by Jethro Tull in their album &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;.

==In other countries==

Premium Bonds under various names exist or have existed in various countries. Similar programmes to UK Premium Bonds include:

* In the Republic of Ireland, Prize Bonds also originated in early 1957.
* In Sweden, &quot;Premieobligationer&quot; usually run for five years and are traded on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm. The unit (one Bond) is generally 1000 SEK or 5000 SEK. Holders of 10 or 50 consecutive bonds starting at 1 + N * 10 or 50 are guaranteed one win per year. Outstanding bonds were around 28.9 billion SEK.
* In Denmark, &quot;Premieobligationer&quot; usually ran for five or 10 years with a fixed prize list printed on the physical bonds. They were physical bearer bonds and most series were extended one or more times by another 5 or 10 years. The last series have now ended and must be redeemed for their principal cash within 10 years of the final ending dates. The bonds were generally identified by their colour, for instance the blue premium bonds were issued in 1948, and were redeemed in 1998 (10 years + 4 10-year extension). The first 200 DKK of each prize was tax free, the rest taxed at only 15% (compared to 30% or more for ordinary income).
* In New Zealand, &quot;Bonus Bonds&quot; were established by the NZ Government in 1970 and sold to ANZ Bank in 1990. In August 2020 it was announced that the scheme would close due to low interest rates reducing the prize pool. At the time of the announcement there were 1.2m bondholders with NZD $3.2 billion invested.

=== Unrelated concepts ===
In 2023, American economist Paul Krugman used the name &quot;premium bonds&quot; for an unrelated type of bond that he proposed to avoid a default due to the United States debt ceiling.

==Academic studies==
In 2008, two financial economists, Lobe and Hoelzl, analysed the main driving factors for the immense marketing success of Premium Bonds. One in three Britons invest in Premium Bonds. The thrill of gambling is significantly boosted by enhancing the skewness of the prize distribution. However, using data collected over the past fifty years, they found that the bond bears relatively low risk compared to many other investments.

Aaron Brown discusses in a 2006 book Premium Bonds in comparison with equity-linked, commodity-linked and other &quot;added risk&quot; bonds. His conclusion is that it makes little difference, either to a retail investor or from a theoretical finance perspective, whether the added risk comes from a random number generator or from fluctuations in financial markets.

<text>Shute Barrington (26 May 173425 March 1826) was an English churchman, Bishop of Llandaff in Wales, as well as Bishop of Salisbury and Bishop of Durham in England.

==Early life==
Barrington was born at Beckett Hall in Shrivenham in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), the home of his father, John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington and mother, Anne née Daines, and educated at Eton College and Merton College, Oxford.

==Church career==
Barrington was ordained a deacon by Thomas Secker, Bishop of Oxford, on 28 November 1756 at St Aldate&#x27;s Church, Oxford; he was presumably ordained a priest within a year. In 1761 he was a made a canon of Christ Church, Oxford and in 1768 a canon of St Paul&#x27;s from where he moved to be a canon at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. In 1769 he was elevated to the episcopate as Bishop of Llandaff; his election was confirmed on 23 September and he was consecrated a bishop on 1 October at Lambeth Palace chapel by Frederick Cornwallis, Archbishop of Canterbury (assisted by Richard Terrick, Bishop of London, and Zachary Pearce, Bishop of Rochester.) He was elected on 14 August 1782 to become Bishop of Salisbury, and was translated to that see upon the confirmation of that election on 27 August at St Mary le Bow. As Bishop of Salisbury he was also &quot;ex officio&quot; Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. He was further translated to be Bishop of Durham following his election on 25 June 1791.

Barrington was a vigorous Protestant, though willing to grant Roman Catholics &quot;every degree of toleration short of political power and establishment.&quot; He published several volumes of sermons and tracts, and wrote the political life of his elder brother, William Barrington. From 1805 to 1826 he was the Visitor of Balliol College, Oxford and in 1806 backed the then Master, John Parsons, in opening the Fellowships to competition.

Barrington was a great patron of architecture and education in the diocese of Durham. One school, Bishop Barrington Academy, still exists today in Bishop Auckland. To mark his fiftieth year in the prelacy, the diocese of Durham built the Clergy Jubilee School in Newcastle and arranged that Dame Allan&#x27;s Schools should be housed there. In architecture he employed James Wyatt to remodel Salisbury Cathedral, as well as the Georgian Gothic interiors of Auckland Castle, his favoured residence.

Barrington was also a primary litigant in &quot;Morice v Bishop of Durham&quot; (1805)10 Ves 522, which is a leading case on the conditions necessary to form a trust in English law.

Barrington had an extensive correspondence with Thomas Moody, who named one of his sons, Shute Barrington Moody (b. 1818), after Shute Barrington.

He died in Soho in Middlesex (now Greater London). He is buried at St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, near his home at Mongewell Park, close to Wallingford, Oxfordshire.

==Memorials==

A fine marble monument was erected to Barrington&#x27;s memory in Durham Cathedral sculpted by Francis Chantrey.

==Marriages==
Barrington married firstly, on 2 February 1761, the Lady Diana Beauclerk (c. 1735–28 March 1766), daughter of Charles Beauclerk, 2nd Duke of St Albans. His wife died in childbirth, the child stillborn. He married secondly, on 20 June 1770, Jane Guise (d. 8 August 1807), daughter of Sir John Guise, but had no children.

<text>The Aquila was a nine-cylinder single-row radial aircraft engine designed by the Bristol Engine Company starting in 1934. A sleeve valve engine, its basic design was developed from the Bristol Perseus. The Aquila was never used in production, but further developments led to the Bristol Hercules, Bristol Taurus, and Bristol Centaurus.

==Design and development==
The Aquila was developed two years after the somewhat larger Perseus, both being sleeve valve designs. The primary difference was in size, the Perseus being based on the cylinder used in the Mercury engine, while the Aquila used a new and smaller sized cylinder. The result was a reduction in displacement from 1520 to 950 cubic inches (24.9 to 15.6 L).

The first Aquila engine delivered a modest , which was unspectacular for an engine of this size. It soon developed into more powerful versions as improvements were worked into the line (as well as similar changes to the Perseus), and by 1936 it had improved to . This would have made it an excellent replacement for the Bristol Jupiter, which ended production at three years earlier, but by this time almost all interest was on ever-larger engines.

<text>Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV (23 August 1883 – 2 September 1953) was an American army general and the Commander of Allied forces in the Philippines at the time Japan surrendered to the United States, during World War II.

Wainwright commanded American and Filipino forces during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, for which he received a Medal of Honor for his courageous leadership. In May 1942, on the island stronghold of Corregidor, lacking food, supplies and ammunition, in the interest of minimizing casualties Wainwright surrendered the remaining Allied forces on the Philippines. At the time of his capture, Wainwright was the highest-ranking American prisoner of war, spending three years in Japanese prison camps, during which he suffered from malnutrition and mistreatment. In August 1945, he was rescued by the Red Army in Manchukuo. Hailed as a hero upon his liberation, on 5 September 1945, shortly after the Japanese surrender, Wainwright was promoted to four-star General.

== Early life and training ==
Wainwright, nicknamed &quot;Skinny&quot; and &quot;Jim&quot;, was born at Fort Walla Walla, a former Army post near Walla Walla, Washington. His father was a U.S. Army officer who was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Cavalry in 1875, rose to the rank of major, commanded a squadron of the 5th Cavalry at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish–American War, and, in 1902, died of disease in the Philippines. His grandfather was Lieutenant Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright II, USN, who was killed in action during the Battle of Galveston in 1863. Congressman J. Mayhew Wainwright was a cousin.

Wainwright graduated from Highland Park High School in Illinois in 1901, and from West Point in 1906. He served as First Captain of the Corps of Cadets.

He was commissioned in the cavalry, serving with the 1st Cavalry Regiment (United States) in Texas from 1906 to 1908 and in the Philippines from 1908 to 1910, during which time he saw combat on Jolo, during the Moro Rebellion. Wainwright graduated from the Mounted Service School, Fort Riley, Kansas, in 1916 and was promoted to Captain. By 1917, he was on the staff of the first officer training camp at Plattsburgh, New York.

In 1911, Wainwright married Adele &quot;Kitty&quot; Holley, and had one child with her, Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright V (1913–1996).

== World War I ==
In February 1918, during World War I, Wainwright was ordered to France. In June, he became assistant chief of staff of the U.S. 82nd Infantry Division, with which he took part in the Saint Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne Offensives. As a temporary lieutenant colonel, he was assigned to occupation duty in Germany with the 3rd Army at Koblenz, Germany, from October 1918 until 1920. Having reverted to the rank of captain, he was then promoted to major.

== Inter-war period ==
After a year as an instructor at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley, Wainwright was attached to the general staff from 1921 to 1923 and assigned to the 3rd US Cavalry Regiment, Fort Myer, Virginia, from 1923–25. In 1929, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and graduated from the Command and General Staff School, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1931, and from the Army War College in 1934.

Wainwright was promoted to colonel in 1935, and served as commander of the 3rd US Cavalry Regiment until 1938, when he was promoted to brigadier general in command of the 1st Cavalry Brigade at Fort Clark, Texas.

== World War II ==

In September 1940, Wainwright was promoted to major general (temporary) and returned to the Philippines, in December, as commander of the Philippine Department.

As the senior field commander of Filipino and US forces under General Douglas MacArthur, Wainwright was responsible for resisting the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, which began in December 1941. On 8 December 1941, he commanded the North Luzon Force, comprising three reserve Filipino divisions and the 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts). Retreating from the Japanese beachhead of Lingayen Gulf, Allied forces had withdrawn onto the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor by January 1942, where they defended the entrance to Manila Bay.

Following the evacuation of MacArthur to Australia in March to serve as Allied Supreme Commander, South West Pacific Area, Wainwright inherited the unenviable position of Allied commander in the Philippines. Also that March, Wainwright was promoted to lieutenant general (temporary). On 9 April, the 70,000 troops on Bataan surrendered under the command of Major General Edward P. King. On 5 May, the Japanese attacked Corregidor. Due to lack of supplies (mainly food and ammunition) and in the interest of minimizing casualties, Wainwright notified Japanese General Masaharu Homma he was surrendering on 6 May.

Wainwright at the same time sent a coded message to Major General William F. Sharp, in charge of forces on Mindanao naming him as commander of all forces in the Philippines, excepting those on Corregidor and three other islands in Manila Bay. Sharp was now to report to General MacArthur, now stationed in Australia. This was to cause as few troops as possible to be surrendered. Homma refused to allow the surrender of any less than all the troops in the Philippines and considered the troops on and around Corregidor to be hostages to ensure other forces in the Philippines would lay down their arms. Wainwright then agreed to surrender Sharp&#x27;s men.

General Sharp was placed in a difficult position. He knew if he ignored Wainwright&#x27;s wish for him to surrender that the hostage troops and civilians at Corregidor could be massacred. Though his troops were badly mauled, they could still put up a fight. It had been expected they would fight on as a guerrilla force. In the end, on 10 May, Sharp decided to surrender. Sharp&#x27;s surrender proved problematic for the Japanese. For although Sharp and many of his men surrendered and suffered as prisoners of war until liberated in 1945, a large number of Sharp&#x27;s men — the vast majority of them Filipino — refused to surrender. Some soldiers considered Wainwright&#x27;s surrender to have been made under duress, and ultimately decided to join the guerrilla movement led by Colonel Wendell Fertig.

By 9 June, Allied forces had completely surrendered. Wainwright was then held in prison camps in northern Luzon, Formosa, and Liaoyuan (then called Xi&#x27;an and a county within Manchukuo) until he was rescued by the Red Army in August 1945.
Wainwright was the highest-ranking American POW, and, despite his rank, his treatment at the hands of the Japanese was no less unpleasant than that of most of his men. When he met General MacArthur in August 1945 shortly after his liberation, he had become thin and malnourished from three years of mistreatment during captivity. He witnessed the Japanese surrender aboard the on 2 September and was given one of five pens (along with British Lieutenant General Arthur Percival) that MacArthur used to sign the document. Together with Percival, he returned to the Philippines to receive the surrender of the local Japanese commander, Lieutenant-General Tomoyuki Yamashita.

Dubbed by his men a &quot;fighting&quot; general who was willing to get down in the foxholes, Wainwright won the respect of all who were imprisoned with him. He agonized over his decision to surrender Corregidor throughout his captivity, feeling that he had let his country down. Upon release, the first question he asked was how people back in the U.S. thought of him, and he was amazed when told he was considered a hero. He later received the Medal of Honor, an honor which had first been proposed early in his captivity, in 1942, but was rejected due to the vehement opposition of General MacArthur, who felt that Corregidor should not have been surrendered. MacArthur did not oppose the renewed proposal in 1945.

== Post-war years and retirement ==
On 5 September 1945, shortly after the Japanese surrender, Wainwright was promoted to four-star general. On 7 September, Wainwright would oversee the ceremony which led to the Japanese Instrument of Surrender documents being exhibited at the National Archives. On 13 September, a ticker-tape parade in New York City was held in his honor. On 28 September, he was named commander of the Second Service Command and the Eastern Defense Command at Fort Jay, Governors Island, New York.

On 11 January 1946, he was named commander of the Fourth Army at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, filling the vacancy left by the 21 November 1945 death of Lieutenant General Alexander Patch. Patch, formerly commander of the Seventh Army in the closing days of World War II, had returned to the United States in August 1945 because of poor health to head the Fourth Army.

Wainwright retired on 31 August 1947, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 64, stating that he was reluctant to do so.

He became a Freemason in May 1946 at Union Lodge No. 7. in Junction City, Kansas, and a Shriner soon after.

In 1948, he was elected the national commander of Disabled American Veterans (DAV).

About 1935, Wainwright was elected a Hereditary Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (insignia number 19087) by right of his grandfather&#x27;s service in the Union Navy during the Civil War. He was also a Compatriot of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (national number 66232 and state number 7762). His membership application for the SAR was endorsed by General Douglas MacArthur.

He served on the board of directors for several corporations after his retirement. He made himself available to speak before veterans&#x27; groups and filled almost every request to do so. He never felt any bitterness toward MacArthur for his actions in the Philippines or MacArthur&#x27;s attempt to deny him the Medal of Honor. In fact, when it appeared that MacArthur might be nominated for president at the 1948 Republican National Convention, Wainwright stood ready to make the nominating speech.

He died of a stroke in San Antonio, Texas on 2 September 1953, aged 70.

Wainwright was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, next to his wife and near his parents. Present during the funeral were Omar Bradley, George Marshall and Edward King, with a conspicuous absence of MacArthur. He was buried with a Masonic service, and is one of the few people to have had their funeral held in the lower level of the Memorial Amphitheater.

=== Medal of Honor citation ===
Rank and Organization: General, Commanding U.S. Army Forces in the Philippines. Place and date: Philippine Islands, 12 March to 7 May 1942. Entered Service at: Skaneateles, N.Y. Birth: Walla Walla, Wash. G.O. No.: 80, 19 September 1945.

Citation:
Distinguished himself by intrepid and determined leadership against greatly superior enemy forces. At the repeated risk of life above and beyond the call of duty in his position, he frequented the firing line of his troops where his presence provided the example and incentive that helped make the gallant efforts of these men possible. The final stand on beleaguered Corregidor, for which he was in an important measure personally responsible, commanded the admiration of the Nation&#x27;s allies. It reflected the high morale of American arms in the face of overwhelming odds. His courage and resolution were a vitally needed inspiration to the then sorely pressed freedom-loving peoples of the world.

General Wainwright was presented the Medal of Honor in an impromptu ceremony when he visited the White House on 10 September 1945; he was not aware that he was there to be decorated by President Harry S. Truman.

<doc id="160693" wikidata="Q8005116" url="?curid=160693" title="William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington">
<text>William Wildman Shute Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington, PC (15 January 1717 – 1 February 1793), was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons for 38 years from 1740 to 1778. He was best known for his two periods as Secretary at War during Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Seven Years War and American War of Independence.

==Background==
Barrington was the eldest son of John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington, by his wife Anne, daughter of Sir William Daines. The Hon. Daines Barrington, Rear-Admiral the Hon. Samuel Barrington and the Right Reverend the Hon. Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham, were his younger brothers. He received a private education under a tutor at Dalston, Robert Graham, whose family later established a political dynasty. Sent to be further educated at Geneva, Switzerland in 1735 he spent three years at the alpine university; having inherited the estates and title in 1734, he spent some time travelling on the Grand Tour. After coming of age in January 1738, he returned home, arriving in England that February.

==Early political career==
As Barrington&#x27;s title was in the Peerage of Ireland it did not entitle him to a seat in the British House of Lords. In March 1740 he was returned to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed (a seat his father had represented from 1714 to 1723). Joining the opposition benches, Barrington took his seat in 1741 for Walpole&#x27;s dismissal, voting down a bill for manning the fleet on the grounds it would increase the &#x27;Court Whigs&#x27; influence on the coast.

With the exception of Lord Carteret, the energetic foreign minister, Barrington, having deserted the whigs found his new allies pitiable reformers. None of the corruption went punished, as the promised &#x27;new broom&#x27; failed to materialise. The Hanoverian Ascendancy was magnified by the military exploits of allies Hanoverian Legion that lionised Carteret&#x27;s performance and the King&#x27;s role in the warfare, but at considerable expense to the Treasury. Barrington was among the opposition peers consulted for a new ministry in 1744 between the Cobhamites and the incumbent Pelhamites, removing Carteret, now earl Granville, and his Tory friends from office. In February he had voted down two bills, one to suspend Habeas Corpus, on the grounds that the ministry had not proven the rumours of an impending French invasion. Tory opposition led by Pitt stormed out of the chamber in protest at Barrington&#x27;s speech. A decisive move came when he identified with Lord Cobham. Grenville was impressed by the young MP; refusing the offer of a &#x27;lord of trade&#x27; the future peer could do &quot;whatever he pleases&quot;.

== Grenvillite Whig: a war departmental career ==
A critical year was 1744 for the young aspiring minister: perhaps the pressure of Jacobitism, the return of the Army from Flanders, and the whiff of Jacobite conspiracy forced a change of allegiance. For on 23 January in the first of such votes, Barrington elucidated his principled support for a Standing Army. The following month he voted with the Treasury money bill. He steered a flagship policy National Militia bill through parliament that excluded Catholics and Quakers. He reformed the process of Charitable parochial relief, rather than requiring its total abolition, although by 1782 he took a Pittite view of reform.

Having taken his seat in the Irish House of Lords in 1745, still only twenty-eight year old, he was appointed one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, later being forced to write a vindication of his conduct of affairs during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear in which large sums went missing from the Treasury. In 1746 Barrington was one of the &#x27;managers&#x27; of the impeachment of the Highland general Lord Lovat, and lord of the Admiralty in February 1746. But with the conflict brought to a successful conclusion in 1748, Barrington seconded a motion that required the King to demobilise 16,000 Hanoverian soldiers in peacetime. Barrington was also responsible for the introduction of the concept of half-pay to the navy, as a means of effecting semi-retirement for laid off officers. His Commons bill enumerated 20,000 sailors for redundancy. This &#x27;tory&#x27; bill was vigorously opposed by Lord Egmont, and the Pelhamites defeated it in the Commons. A Quarantine bill was drafted to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the fleet, as well as to blockade its importation onto the mainland. Barrington&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Paper on the Plague&quot; helped to establish a House of Recovery for the Sick at Gray&#x27;s Inn, which was extended to the dying and suffering in London.

==Secretary at War==

On Pelham&#x27;s death in March 1754, the Duke of Newcastle was in line to succeed as First Lord of the Treasury. On becoming Member of Parliament for Plymouth, Barrington applied directly for a treasury bench seat, on the recommendation of Henry Fox. Pelham had already gone to the palace to &#x27;kiss hands&#x27;. On the understanding of a Treasury seat for the public economist, Barrington succeeded Sir Thomas Robinson as the Master of the Great Wardrobe in 1755, when he was granted a seat as Privy Counsellor. At Newcastle House in September Barrington was informed the arrangement was squared with the king, but Cumberland, the Commander-in-Chief at Windsor, did not know of it. He was appointed as Secretary at War in the Duke of Newcastle cabinet. The supremacy of cabinet government over Wardrobe, Treasury over commander-in-chief in the realm of the patronage of political appointments can be dated from Newcastle&#x27;s office tenure. Barrington held the post for the next six years throughout the Seven Years&#x27; War, despite the Byzantine logistics, and notorious corruption at the war office owing to his scrupulous attitude towards corrupt practices revealed in his letters.

Shortly after the new ministry had come to office, Minorca fell. Barrington ordered the 7th regiment to reinforce the Gibraltar garrison on 21 March 1756. The cabinet insisted the rock must be held as a strategic naval base; Barrington&#x27;s experience told him this, switching the Governor&#x27;s detachment, a battalion onto Byng&#x27;s flagship. In the event the garrison could not spare the men: facing the threat of an attack by the Toulon fleet, Barrington was clear in a subsequent letter that Gibraltar must not be left undefended. But Byng&#x27;s subsequent disgrace and execution left Barrington&#x27;s loyalties in doubt. He had shown no disobedience to His Majesty the King, when General Fowke was tried at court martial for allegedly abandoning his post. Cumberland was disgusted at the loss of Port Mahon, its naval base, and the shame brought upon the military&#x27;s discipline and reputation, adding to the Secretary&#x27;s political problems; Barrington consequently clung to Newcastle&#x27;s patronage at least in part for self-preservation. Modern historians have laid the blame at barrington&#x27;s door for the confusion that ensued from the contradictory orders; but much of the contention has derived from his belated conversion to Toryism, and embracing of a Pittite bluewater policy with all its attenuated risks.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister insisted on quizzing Granby on the battlefield with young Barrington in tow learning how to disappoint generals for the future. During the Seven Years War, his brothers, Admiral Sir Samuel Barrington and Major-General John Barrington, who led the assault expeditionary force that captured Guadeloupe, a French colony, were both active in the Caribbean. Barrington remained a staunch friend and ally of Newcastle throughout, always grateful for the confidence, but never afraid to differ from the duke &quot;to whom I owe more compliance than to any man living, because he is the only subject, to whom i have a real obligation. I must do his Grace the justice...&quot; The previous October he had advised Field Marshall Ligioner, by now a Viscount, that his brother was over-promoted &quot;I again deprecate Colonel Barrington being so near the command; and i entreat of your Lordship to recommend some other Major-General to His Majesty, in case Mr Boscawen should be excused.&quot; In the light of his compassion, the story of Colonel Monro&#x27;s Arabian horse seemed typical of the man&#x27;s discreet delicacy, nursing his gifted steed back to health, but putting its ownership into trust. Barrington was always careful to avoid accusations of taking sweeteners or inducements for corrupt practices; sufficiently astute to defer on matters of ethical credibility to others. The cost of the war was ruinous; and Barrington refused to accede to the duke&#x27;s demand to buy the Election of 1761.

== Tory George III: Barrington and a new administration ==
On 12 March 1761 he was transferred to the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, just ten days before the dissolution of parliament. In 1762 the Tory Prime Minister proposed Barrington Treasurer of the Navy, which he accepted, but remained close to the duke, who declined to oppose the new ministry. Senior cabinet ministers may have met in autumn 1762 at Beckett, his ancestral seat. For he was probably influential in the reconciliation between Newcastle and Cumberland, long embittered rivals, because in a letter to Barrington on 11 July he had signed off &quot;your affectionate friend&quot;. Moreover, he strongly advised his whig friend to join with the Tories. Barrington&#x27;s membership of Bute&#x27;s ministry, in spite of his friendship with Newcastle, who was at the height of his powers, was, he claimed, on the basis of being a principled &quot;servant of the Crown&quot;; for the main achievement of Bute&#x27;s time in office was the Peace of Paris in April 1763. On principle he would not oppose the ministry from within, and yet would not resign to suit his friend, mentor and patron. Bute suggested enlarging the government with a Foxite Coalition; but Barrington, who long been a friend of Charles James Fox felt &quot;a coolness between us&quot;.

The Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s resignation, he feared, would destabilise the administration. And so it did precipitating in Newcastle&#x27;s words, &quot;such a clamour arising against the Ministry&quot;. At a meeting at Newcastle House, London, on 11 November the duke pressed Barrington to end his support, knowing the ministry would fall, which it did in April 1763. Yet while in office, the Viscount never visited Claremont, upheld bipartisan principles, and remained on friendly terms with Bute, Grenville, Egremont and Halifax.

On 17 July 1765 Barrington returned to London to seek his former position of secretary at war from the King whom he told: &quot;That a man like me, solely attached to himself, must not expect many &quot;Court&quot; friends&quot;, at St James&#x27;s Palace as department GHQ, at once abandoned by General Ligonier, who preferred the &quot;esprit de corps&quot; of Knightsbridge. Barrington told Charles Gould, the Advocate-General that he was the &quot;guardian&quot; of the interests of &quot;the poor, though deserving officer&quot;. He told the king that he &quot;detested faction&quot; and &quot;...would never have anything to do with it&quot;. It was two days before he informed the Prime Minister that he had &#x27;kissed hands&#x27; with the Sovereign. On 26 July, Barrington, the prospect of joining a Tory Chatham ministry looming over the horizon, played his royal hand again to stay in government. Yorke told the Pelhamite Hardwicke that he stayed &quot;by virtue of his pliability&quot;. It became Barrington&#x27;s political hallmark that his pledged allegiance was to the Army and the King only; while Cumberland was Commander-in-Chief he would share in any political decisions.

Barrington remained in the party, yet a country whig/Tory for all that with independently minded ideas distinct from London whiggery. One particular dispute that rankled was the outstanding furore with the most distinguished soldier of his generation, Lord Ligonier.

&quot;I have not time to answer your Lordship&#x27;s letter of Sunday, which i received last night: perhaps it is better i should not particularly answer it, as I wish always to keep my temper especially with those who are older and wiser than myself...it certainly does not extend to make a Secretary at War give the King advice, which he thinks wrong. I told your Lordship very explicitly at our first outset, that I never would.&quot;
Disliked by the Commander-in-chief Lord Ligonier, eyed warily from the Guards barracks at Knightsbridge, Barrington immediately had to deal with a number of crises: The Weavers and Corn Riots prompted the Life Guards out onto the streets, &quot;The present riotous assemblings on account of high price of corn made it necessary for the Magistrates to call in a military force to their assistance,&quot;wrote mr Secretary. The Wilkes Riots of 1768/9 also called on the army to quench the rioters anger deployed, protesting at their champion&#x27;s exclusion, the Household Cavalry were deployed in Parliament Square to protect the buildings.

== The problem of the Colonies ==
Barrington took his share of the blame for the loss of the American colonies, and was not allowed to forget it. In 1765 the Rockingham whigs in the cabinet wanted to repeal the Stamp Act, but Barrington was among the minority who insisted the Americans should pay their way. This hard line approach to complex legal problems characterised the ministry, the non-importation embargo for instance begun by the Americans in 1768/9 was bankrupting the East India Company; the dumping of China tea just one expression of the violence to follow. So when John Wilkes petitioned to be allowed to take his seat in the Commons, Barrington and the Paymaster of the Forces, Richard Rigby led the cabinet in throwing him out.

In 1775 Barrington ordered a reluctant General Burgoyne to be put in command of the British forces in the northern American theatre of war. The two men shared a belief in the same bluewater strategy. Barrington was in charge of the army, but strategic deployment of the Royal Navy was the only way to defeat the rebels. Blockade and strangulation of colonial trade should be coupled to a large standing army, he declared. But it should not pursue &#x27;a wild goose chase&#x27; of Americans around the countryside. Burgoyne&#x27;s defeat at Saratoga ended in disgrace and recall to England. Even Barrington was not altogether convinced of Burgoyne&#x27;s abilities to resist corruption, and the practice of commission purchases, an issue he helped straighten with the firm.

&quot;...after a series of favours of which the army does not furnish a precedent, and to which with all his amiable and valuable qualities as a man he had not the least claim as a soldier...Has Lieutenant-Colonel Burgoyne a right to every douceur, which General Elliot may expect? Or can he demand more than his bargain?&quot; Barrington wished young officers who wanted preferment to buy, or await promotion by seniority. Burgoyne&#x27;s friend and mentor, Barrington retained office but only until December 1778, when the Rockingham whigs resumed majority control in the Commons. In 1759 Burgoyne had threatened him; Barrington responded &quot;with the House of Commons, in case i am, what you call partial against you...the least courtly letter that was ever written to a Secretary at War.&quot; Barrington raised more regiments and increased the places at Old Chelsea Hospital for wounded men. Wages improved slightly, and more compassion was shown after battle; developments that dovetailed with the career of Marquis of Granby. Hospital Board Surgeon Mates were introduced, and an Inspector of Infirmaries was appointed overseer. Ending the practice of &quot;in commendam&quot; holding every second corps in reserve because it was ruinous to finances exemplified his public policy credentials of saving graces, but critics thought it left England dangerously exposed to invasion from the continent. But more aptly was his fear of domestic unruliness and disorder. Perennial riots was an habitual occurrence on London streets:

London is of all places in the island most attentively to be watched, he warned ...if an insurrection in London should be attended with the least success, or even to continue unquelled for any time...,
Like North, Barrington hated the American revolution. It made him sick with worry. He told the king it is &quot;more disagreeable to me&quot;. He had been a minister for thirty years, was weary, tired of the work, and wanted to retire, aged sixty. The King&#x27;s minister, virtually his whole career, he realised that the Sovereign&#x27;s word was his bond. King George III wanted him to quit the Commons but remain a minister; but the correct constitutional position for any minister was in parliament, particularly for a Secretary at War, a second non-cabinet rank. But the war caused these decisions to be pushed to one side, ignored and delayed. On 29 October 1777, Barrington again applied for the Chiltern Hundreds. Burgoyne&#x27;s catastrophic defeat was the catalyst: finally, after a protracted and agonising wait, he could no longer hold his own counsel &quot;or oppose them, without affecting my honour and duty&quot;. He was allowed to receive the Chiltern Hundreds on 24 May 1778, but was compelled to remain at the War Office until Christmas.

== Semi-retirement ==
For four months in 1782 Barrington was joint Postmaster General. The death of his predecessor threw open a vacancy at the cabinet table. Barrington was the most qualified candidate, who had to forego a generous pension from 9 January to qualify. Lord North&#x27;s defeat however ushered in the whiggish friends of America to conclude the Paris Treaty, forcing Barrington to resign in April. Shelburne had always opposed the King&#x27;s attempts to prevent American colonial independence; and so withheld his Civil list pension of £2000 which had been settled on him &quot;unsolicited&quot; by the King. Barrington appealed directly to George III who guaranteed it was &quot;renewed and continued&quot; for public service until his death.

==Family==
Lord Barrington married Mary, daughter of Henry Lovell and widow of the Hon. Samuel Grimston, in 1740. There were no surviving children from the marriage. She died in September 1764. Barrington remained a widower until his death at his country estate, Beckett Hall at Shrivenham in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), in February 1793, aged 76. He was buried in St. Andrew&#x27;s parish church, Shrivenham. His nephew William Barrington succeeded in the viscountcy.

<doc id="160695" wikidata="Q720910" url="?curid=160695" title="Daniel Chester French">
<text>Daniel Chester French (April 20, 1850 – October 7, 1931) was an American sculptor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His works include &quot;The Minute Man&quot;, an 1874 statue in Concord, Massachusetts, and his 1920 monumental statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

==Early life and education==
French was born on April 20, 1850, in Exeter, New Hampshire, the son of Anne Richardson (1811–1856), daughter of William Merchant Richardson (1774–1838), chief justice of New Hampshire, and of Henry Flagg French (1813–1885), a lawyer, judge, Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary, and author of a book that described the French drain. His siblings were Henriette Van Mater French Hollis (1839–1911), Sarah Flagg French Bartlett (1846–1883), and William M.R. French (1843–1914). He was the uncle of Senator Henry F. Hollis. 

In 1867, French moved with his family to Concord, Massachusetts, where he was a neighbor and friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the Alcott family. His decision to pursue sculpting was influenced by Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s sister Abigail May Alcott.

French&#x27;s early education included training in anatomy with William Rimmer and in drawing with William Morris Hunt. French spent a year studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and also several years in Florence, Italy, studying in the studio of Thomas Ball.

==Career==
French first earned acclaim for &quot;The Minute Man&quot;, commissioned by the town of Concord, Massachusetts, which was unveiled April 19, 1875, on the centenary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first armed conflict of the American Revolutionary War.

French established his own studio, first in Washington, D.C., which he later moved to Boston and then to New York City. In 1893, French&#x27;s reputation grew with his &quot;Statue of the Republic&quot; for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Other works by French include the &quot;First Division Monument&quot; and the &quot;Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain&quot;, both in Washington, D.C., &quot;John Harvard&quot; on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, bronze doors for the Boston Public Library in Boston, and &quot;Four Continents&quot; at the U.S. Custom House, New York, later renamed the Alexander Hamilton US Custom House. In addition to the Lincoln Memorial, French collaborated with architect Henry Bacon on memorials around the country, including the Dupont Circle fountain in Washington, D.C.

In 1893, French was a founding member of the National Sculpture Society, and he was appointed a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1913. During this time, he served as an instructor at the Art Students League of New York, teaching sculpture there in 1890 and 1898. French also became a member of the National Academy of Design (1901), the American Academy of Arts and Letters (which awarded him the Gold Medal for Sculpture in 1917), the Architectural League, and the Accademia di San Luca, of Rome. He was a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and a co-founder of the American Academy in Rome. He was a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor and was awarded a medal of honor from the Paris Exposition of 1900; he also was granted honorary degrees from Dartmouth, Yale, Harvard, and Columbia universities. He was a founding member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, serving from 1910 to 1915, including as chairman from 1912 to 1915. 

In 1917, French and a colleague, Henry Augustus Lukeman, designed the Pulitzer Prize gold medal presented to laureates. French designed the side of the prize with Benjamin Franklin on it, while Lukeman created the iconic design of the printing press and the wording on the award: &quot;For disinterested and meritorious public service rendered by an American newspaper during the year….&quot;. In collaboration with Edward Clark Potter he modeled the George Washington statue, commissioned by a group that called itself &quot;The Association of American Women for the Erection of a Statue of Washington in Paris&quot; and unveiled in the Place d&#x27;Iena in Paris, France, in 1900; the General Grant statue in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, commissioned by the Association for Public Art (formerly the Fairmount Park Art Association); and the equestrian statue of Joseph Hooker in Boston.

French was one of many sculptors who frequently employed Audrey Munson as a model; another frequent sitter was Hettie Anderson. Together with Walter Leighton Clark and others, he was also one of the founders of the Berkshire Playhouse, which later became the Berkshire Theatre Festival. French&#x27;s daughter, Margaret, also occasionally modeled for him, including for some of his rare portrait paintings, and became famous in her own right as a sculptor under the name Margaret French Cresson.
In 1917, Harvard&#x27;s citation in conferring an honorary Master of Arts referred to his statue of Emerson when it called him &quot;a sculptor, whose skillful hand, unlike that of the friend whom he portrayed, has not been stopped but spared to adorn our land by the creation of his art&quot;. French also taught; among his pupils was the sculptor Edith Howland.

==Death==
French died in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, in 1931 at age 81, and was interred in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord.

<text>The Taurus is a British 14-cylinder two-row radial aircraft engine, produced by the Bristol Engine Company starting in 1936. The Taurus was developed by adding cylinders to the existing single-row Aquila design and transforming it into a twin-row radial engine, creating a powerplant that produced just over with very low weight.

==Design and development==
Bristol had originally intended to use the Aquila and Perseus as two of its major product lines in the 1930s, but the rapid increase in size and speed of aircraft in the 1930s demanded much larger engines. The mechanicals from both of these designs were then put into two-row configurations to develop much larger engines, the Aquila becoming the Taurus, and the Perseus becoming the Hercules.

The Taurus used sleeve valves, resulting in an uncluttered exterior and little mechanical noise. It offered high power with a relatively low weight, starting from in the earliest versions. It was also compact, with a diameter of which made it attractive for fighters. Unfortunately, the engine was also described as &quot;notoriously troublesome&quot;, with protracted development and a slow growth in rated power. After several years of development, power had only increased from to . As the most important applications of this engine was in aircraft that flew at low altitude, development efforts focused on low-altitude performance.

The first Taurus engines were delivered just before World War II, and was used primarily in the Fairey Albacore and Bristol&#x27;s Beaufort. In April 1940, a suggestion was made to replace the Taurus engines of the latter with the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 &quot;Twin Wasp&quot;, which had a slightly larger diameter, but this change was postponed to the autumn of 1941 while attempts were made to cure the Taurus&#x27;s reliability problems, and later had to be temporarily reversed because of shortages of Twin Wasps. The Twin Wasp was, however, strongly preferred, especially for overseas postings, because of its better reliability. The reliability problems were mostly cured in later models of the Taurus engine by a change in the cylinder manufacturing process, although the engine reputation never recovered, and in the Albacore the Taurus engine was used until the end of that aircraft&#x27;s production in 1943.

There were no other operational applications of the Taurus engine, because its initial reliability problems discouraged development of Taurus-powered aircraft, and because later-war combat aircraft demanded more powerful engines. Production ended in favour of the Hercules engine.

==Variants==
* Taurus II (1940) – maximum power with boost at 3,225 rpm for take off or one minute using 87 octane fuel. Medium supercharged.
* Taurus III – maximum continuous power, medium supercharged, compression ratio 7.2:1.
* Taurus VI – maximum continuous power, medium supercharged, compression ratio 7.2:1.
* Taurus XII (1940) – maximum continuous power, medium supercharged, compression ratio 7.2:1.
* Taurus XVI (1940) – maximum continuous power, medium supercharged, compression ratio 7.2:1.
* Taurus XX – trials engine only, one built.

==Applications==
&quot;Note:&quot;

*Bristol Type 148
*Bristol Beaufort
*Fairey Albacore
*Fairey Battle testbed only
*Gloster F.9/37

<doc id="160699" wikidata="Q7935689" url="?curid=160699" title="Viscount Barrington">
<text>Viscount Barrington, of Ardglass in the County of Down, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1720 for the lawyer, theologian and politician John Barrington. He was made Baron Barrington, of Newcastle in the County of Limerick, also in the Peerage of Ireland, at the same time. 

Born John Shute, he had assumed by Act of Parliament the surname of Barrington in lieu of his patrilineal surname in 1716, having previously succeeded to the estates of Frances Barrington, married to his cousin.

Four of the younger sons of the first Viscount gained distinction. John Barrington (&quot;c.&quot; 1722 – 1764) was a Major-General in the British Army. Daines Barrington was a lawyer, antiquarian and naturalist. Samuel Barrington was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy. The Right Reverend Shute Barrington was Bishop of Salisbury and Bishop of Durham.

The first viscount was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. He was a politician and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1761 and 1762. He had no surviving children and was succeeded by his nephew, the third Viscount. He was the eldest son of the aforementioned Major-General John Barrington, second son of the first Viscount. Both the third Viscount and his younger brother, the fourth Viscount, died childless. Their younger brother, the fifth viscount, had fifteen children.

On his death in 1829 the titles passed to his eldest son, the sixth Viscount. A Member of Parliament he was also Chairman of the Great Western Railway. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Viscount. He was a Conservative politician and held office as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard between 1885 and 1886 and as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms in 1886. In 1880, he was created Baron Shute, of Beckett in the County of Berkshire, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. The title was created with special remainder to his younger brother, the Hon. Percy Barrington.

Lord Barrington had two daughters but no sons and was succeeded (in the barony of Shute according to the special remainder) by his brother Percy, the eighth Viscount. The titles descended in the direct line until the death of his grandson, the tenth Viscount, in 1960. The late Viscount was succeeded by his nephew, the eleventh Viscount. He was the son of the Hon. Walter Barrington, second son of the ninth Viscount, who was a writer of humorous verse. Lord Barrington was unmarried, and on his death in 1990, all the titles became extinct.

<text>Euthydemus I (Greek: , &quot;Euthýdēmos&quot;, – 200/195 BC) was a Greco-Bactrian king and founder of the Euthydemid dynasty. He is thought to have originally been a satrap of Sogdia, who usurped power from Diodotus II in 224 BC. Literary sources, notably Polybius, record how he and his son Demetrius resisted an invasion by the Seleucid king Antiochus III from 209 to 206 BC. Euthydemus expanded the Bactrian territory into Sogdia, constructed several fortresses, including the Derbent Wall in the Iron Gate, and issued a very substantial coinage.

== Biography==
Euthydemus was an Ionian-Greek from one of the Magnesias in Ionia, though it is uncertain from which one (Magnesia on the Maeander or Magnesia ad Sipylum), and was the father of Demetrius I, according to Strabo and Polybius. William Woodthorpe Tarn proposed that Euthydemus was the son of a Greek general called Antimachus or Apollodotus, born c. 295 BC, whom he considered to be the son of Sophytes, and that he married a sister of the Greco-Bactrian king Diodotus II.

===War with the Seleucid Empire===

Little is known of his reign until 208 BC when he was attacked by Antiochus III the Great, whom he tried in vain to resist on the shores of the river Arius (Battle of the Arius), the modern Harirud. Although he commanded 10,000 horsemen, Euthydemus initially lost a battle on the Arius and had to retreat. He then successfully resisted a three-year siege in the fortified city of Bactra, before Antiochus finally decided to recognize the new ruler, and to offer one of his daughters to Euthydemus&#x27;s son Demetrius around 206 BC. As part of the peace treaty, Antiochus was given Indian war elephants by Euthydemus.

Polybius also relates that Euthydemus negotiated peace with Antiochus III by suggesting that he deserved credit for overthrowing the descendants of the original rebel Diodotus, and that he was protecting Central Asia from nomadic invasions thanks to his defensive efforts.

The war lasted altogether three years and after the Seleucid army left, the kingdom seems to have recovered quickly from the assault. The death of Euthydemus has been roughly estimated to 200 BC or perhaps 195 BC. He was succeeded by Demetrius, who went on to invade northwestern regions of South Asia.

===Activities on the Central Asian Steppe===
Polybius claims that Euthydemus justified his kingship during his peace negotiations with Antiochus III in 206 BC by reference to the threat of attack by nomads on the Central Asian steppe:
:&quot;...[he said that] if [Antiochus] did not yield to this demand, neither of them would be safe: seeing that great hoards of Nomads were close at hand, who were a danger to both; and that if they admitted them into the country, it would certainly be utterly barbarised.&quot; (Polybius, 11.34).
Archaeological evidence from coin finds shows that Euthydemus&#x27; reign saw extensive activity at fortresses in northwestern Bactria (the modern Surkhan Darya region of Uzbekistan), especially in the Gissar and Köýtendag mountains. The Seleucid fortress at Uzundara was expanded and large numbers of Euthydemus&#x27; bronze coins have been found there, as was as hundreds of arrowheads and other remains indicating a violent assault. Coin finds also seem to indicate that Euthydemus was responsible for the first construction of the Derbent Wall, otherwise known as the &quot;Iron Gate&quot;, a 1.6-1.7 km long stone wall with towers and a central fortress guarding a key pass. Landislav Stančo tentatively links the archaeological evidence with the nomad threat. However, Stančo also notes that Derbent wall seems to have been designed not to defend against an attack from Sogdia to the northwest, but from Bactria to the southeast. Hundreds of arrowheads also seem to indicate an attack on the wall from the southeast. Stančo proposes that Euthydemus was originally based in Sogdia and built the fortifications to protect himself from Bactria, before seizing control of the latter. Lucas Christopoulos goes further, proposing that he controlled a large area going from Sogdiana to Gansu and the Tarim basin walled cities together with enrolled Hellenized Saka horsemen even before he ascended the throne of Bactria in 250-230 BC.

===Kuliab inscription===

In an inscription found in the Kuliab area of Tajikistan, northeastern Greco-Bactria, and dated to 200-195 BC, a Greek by the name of Heliodotus, dedicating an altar to Hestia, mentions Euthydemus as the greatest of all kings, and his son Demetrius I:
:This fragrant altar to you, Hestia, most honoured among the gods, Heliodotus established in the grove of Zeus with its fair trees, furnishing it with libations and burnt-offerings, so that you may graciously preserve free from care, together with divine good fortune, Euthydemus, greatest of all kings and his outstanding son Demetrius, renowned for fine victories.
This is a further indication, alongside the passages from Polybius, that Euthydemus had made his son Demetrius a junior partner in his rule during his lifetime. The reference to Demetrius as a &quot;glorious conqueror&quot; might refer to a specific victory, in the conflict with Antiochus III or in India, or look forward to future victories.

==Coinage==

Euthydemus minted coins in gold, silver and bronze at two mints, known as &#x27;Mint A&#x27; and &#x27;Mint B&#x27;. He produced significantly more coins than any of his successors and was the last Greco-Bactrian coinage to include gold denominations until the time of Eucratides I (ca. 170-145 BC). Euthydemus&#x27; gold and silver issues are all minted on the Attic weight standard with a tetradrachm of ca. 16.13 g and all have the same basic design. On the obverse, his face is depicted in profile, clean-shaven, with unruly hair, and a diadem - this iconography is typical of Hellenistic kings, ultimately deriving from depictions of Alexander the Great. The reverse shows Heracles, naked, seated on a rock, resting his club on a neighbouring rock or on his knee, with a legend reading ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΕΥΘΥΔΗΜΟΥ (&#x27;of King Euthydemos&#x27;). Heracles was apparently a popular deity in Bactria, associated with Alexander the Great, but this reverse type is very similar to coins minted by the Seleucids in western Asia Minor, near Euthydemus&#x27; home city of Magnesia. Heracles continues to appear on the coinage of Euthydemus&#x27; immediate successors, Demetrius and Euthydemus II.

There are four distinct versions of the obverse portrait, presumably reflecting different models given to the die engravers. The first of these is an &#x27;idealising&#x27; portrait, depicting him as a young or middle-aged man, with very large eyes, an arching eyebrow, pointed nose and protruding chin, the diadem is very broad. The overall appearance is very similar to images of Diodotus I on his coinage. The second shows him with a tall, large face with heavier jowls; his eye is smaller and the diadem is much narrower. The third portrait is similar, but with the hair above his forehead stylised as a series of semicircles. Finally, in the fourth portrait style, Euthydemus is portrayed as a visibly aged man with very large jowls; his hair also interacts with the diadem in a more natural way. Portrait type 1 is the earliest and portrait type 4 is the latest and these coins have often been interpreted as showing Euthydemus aging over the course of a long reign. However, Simon Glenn argues that the types instead represent a shift from &#x27;idealising&#x27; portraiture to &#x27;naturalising&#x27;, pointing out that distinctions of age in the first three types are highly subjective. This shift to verism represents a substantial divergence from the usual iconography of Hellenistic kings, whose coinage usually showed them in a youthful, idealised guise, regardless of their age. Portrait type 4 has been compared with a Roman-period bust in the Torlonia Collection, which was accordingly identified by Jan Six (art historian) in 1894 as a bust of Euthydemus, known as the &quot;Torlonia Euthydemus.&quot; This identification has been contested by R. R. R. Smith, who identifies the bust as a general of the Roman Republic. 
===Relative chronology===
Like the earlier Diodotid coinage and that of Euthydemus&#x27; successors, monograms and die links allow the precious metal coinage to be divided into two mints, which produced coins simultaneously. &quot;Mint A&quot; uses two types of monogram: one in the form of vertical line bisecting an equilateral triangle, with two shorter vertical lines hanging down from the corners of the triangle, and another with an Α contained within a Π. Mint B initially used three monograms, of which the most long-lasting was a combination of Ρ and Η; later these were replaced by a monogram combining a Ρ and a Κ. A putative &quot;Mint C&quot; has now been shown to be identical with &quot;Mint B&quot;. Frank Holt and Brian Kritt identify &quot;Mint B&quot; with Bactra, the kingdom&#x27;s capital. Holt identifies &quot;Mint A&quot; with Ai Khanoum, while Kritt prefers some other location near Ai Khanoum. Simon Glenn emphasises the that &quot;we do not know the location of either mint&quot; and that it is particularly uncertain whether there was a mint at Ai Khanoum at all.The earliest coins use portrait type 1 and have a 6 o&#x27;clock die axis (i.e. the top of the obverse is aligned with the bottom of the reverse). At Mint A, these coins, Group I (A1-A10) consist of silver tetradrachms, drachms, and hemidrachms; they use either of the two monograms, plus the letters ΤΙ, ΑΝ, Α, Ν, or no monogram at all. These additional letters may have referred to the specific batch of bullion used in minting the coins. Partway through this issue, Mint A switches to a 12 o&#x27;clock die axis (i.e. the top of the obverse is aligned with the top of the reverse). At Mint A, Group I continues after this change. At Mint B (&quot;Group I&quot;), the coins consist of gold staters (ca. 8.27 g), and small numbers of silver tetradrachms and drachms, and all three monograms are used. Some of the gold staters are die-linked to earlier Diodotid coins minted in the name of &quot;Antiochus,&quot; but it is possible that the linked coins are modern forgeries. At Mint B, these coins are followed by Group II (CR1-CR3), which consists of gold staters and silver tetradrachms with portrait type 1 (but with some features similar to portrait model 3). Most of these coins use the Η with triangle monogram.The next period starts with the introduction of the second portrait type. At Mint A, Group II (A11-A14) only tetradrachms were minted in this period, all with the bisected triangle monogram, sometimes accompanied by a Ν or an Α. At Mint B this issue consisted of Group III (CR4), composed of gold staters and silver tetradrachms, with a monogram composed of Ρ, Η, and Α. This is followed by the first issue at Mint B to use a 12 o&#x27;clock die axis, Group IV (B13), consisting only of tetradrachms, all with the ΡΚ monogram, and produced in much large numbers than had previously been the case at Mint B. The third portrait type, introduced only at Mint B, characterises Group V (B14-B15), which consists of tetradrachms and drachms. 

At Mint A, the introduction of portrait type 4 is marked by the start of Group III (A16-A17) and a gold octodrachm (A15) with a reverse modelled on Mint B&#x27;s Group V, known from a single example weighing 32.73 g. This issue is generally associated with the end of Antiochus III&#x27;s siege of Bactra in 206 BC. Group III is much smaller than previous issues at Mint A and is the last issue produced by the mint in Euthydemus&#x27; reign. At Mint B, the introduction of portrait 4 coincides with the large issue of Groups VI and VII (B17).

===Bronze coinage===
In addition to the precious metal coinage, Euthydemus also produced bronze coins. Almost all have a bearded male head, identified as Heracles, on the obverse and a rearing horse on the reverse with the legend ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΕΥΘΥΔΗΜΟΥ (&#x27;of King Euthydemos&#x27;). The earlier coins have thick flans with beveled edges (like the bronze of the Diodotids) and no monograms. These coins were issued in four denominations, referred to by modern scholars as a double unit (5.26-11.82 g), a single unit (2.95-5.07 g), a half unit (1.47-2.28 g), and a quarter unit (0.76-0.79 g). Some of the quarter units have a horse&#x27;s head or a trident on the reverse instead of the usual reverse type. Apparently later issues have thinner, flat flans. These bronzes were minted in the double, single, and half denominations. Most of them have no monograms, but some of them bear the ΡΚ symbol associated with Groups IV-VII at Mint B, and a few have a trident, anchor with ΔΙ, or an Ε. The anchor was one of the main symbols of the Seleucid dynasty and ΔΙ is a monogram used by the Seleucids, so Holt interpreted it as commemorating Euthydemus&#x27; treaty with Antiochus III in 206 BC. Simon Glenn is sceptical of this argument, seeing the anchor and other symbols as control marks, but he entertains the possibility that the anchor indicates &quot;a shared production process&quot; between the anchor bronzes and the coinage produced by Antiochus III in Bactria.

===Posthumous coinage===
Euthydemus is also featured on the &#x27;pedigree&#x27; coinage produced by the later kings Agathocles and Antimachus I. On this coinage he bears the royal epithet, &quot;Theos&quot; (&#x27;God&#x27;); it is unclear whether he used this title in life or if it was assigned to him by Agathocles. His coins were imitated by the nomadic tribes of Central Asia for decades after his death; these imitations are called &quot;barbaric&quot; because of their crude style. Lyonnet proposes that these coins were produced by refugees fleeing the destruction of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom by the Yuezhi in the mid-second century BC.

==Torlonia Euthydemus==

The &quot;Torlonia Euthydemus&quot; or &quot;Albani Euthydemus&quot; bust, now in the Torlonia Collection in Rome but formerly belonging to the Villa Albani collection, has often been suggested as a possible statue of the Bactrian ruler Euthydemus, based on resemblance with his effigy on coinage. This is now rejected, as the statue in question is now considered as a 1st century portrait of a Republican commander or a client ruler. The style of the statue itself is consistent with the style of the Republican period, rather than the Hellenistic period. The style of the broad-brimmed hat on the statue is also very different from the Hellenistic &quot;kausia&quot;.

<text>Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago, Illinois, that was co-founded in 1889 by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr. Located on the Near West Side of Chicago, Hull House, named after the original house&#x27;s first owner Charles Jerald Hull, opened to serve recently arrived European immigrants. By 1911, Hull House had expanded to 13 buildings. In 1912, the Hull House complex was completed with the addition of a summer camp, the Bowen Country Club. With its innovative social, educational, and artistic programs, Hull House became the standard bearer for the movement; by 1920, it grew to approximately 500 settlement houses nationally.

The Hull mansion and several subsequent acquisitions were continuously renovated to accommodate the changing demands of the association. In the mid-1960s, most of the Hull House buildings were demolished for the construction of the University of Illinois Chicago. The original building and one additional building (which has been moved ) survive today. On June 23, 1965, it was designated as a U.S. National Historic Landmark. On October 15, 1966, the day that the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was enacted, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On June 12, 1974, the surviving Hull mansion was designated as a Chicago Landmark.

Hull House was one of the first four structures to be listed on both the Chicago Registered Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places list (along with Chicago Pile-1, Robie House, and Lorado Taft Midway Studios). After The Hull House Association moved from the original buildings complex in the 1960s, it continued to provide social services in multiple locations throughout Chicago. It finally ceased operations in January 2012. The Hull mansion and a related dining hall, the only remaining survivors on the Hull House complex, are now maintained as a history museum, the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum.

==Mission==
Addams followed the example of Toynbee Hall, which was founded in 1884 in the East End of London as a center for social reform. She described Toynbee Hall as &quot;a community of university men&quot; who, while living there, held their recreational clubs and social gatherings at the settlement house among the poor people and in the same style they would in their own circle. Addams and Starr established Hull House as a settlement house on September 18, 1889.

In the 19th century a women&#x27;s movement began to promote education and autonomy, and to break into traditionally male-dominated occupations for women. Organizations led by women, bonded by sisterhood, were formed for social reform, including settlement houses such as Hull House, situated in working class and poor neighborhoods. To develop &quot;new roles for women, the first generation of New Women wove the traditional ways of their mothers into the heart of their brave new world. The social activists, often single, were led by educated New Women.

Hull House became, at its inception in 1889, &quot;a community of university women&quot; whose main purpose was to provide social and educational opportunities for working class people (many of them recent European immigrants) in the surrounding neighborhood. The &quot;residents&quot; (volunteers at Hull were given this title) held classes in literature, history, art, domestic activities (such as sewing), and many other subjects. Prominent scholars and social reformers such as John Dewey, George Herbert Mead, Max Weber, and W.E.B. Du Bois lectured at Hull House. In addition, Hull House held concerts that were free to everyone, offered free lectures on current issues, and operated clubs for both children and adults.
In 1892, Addams published her thoughts on what has been described as &quot;the three R&#x27;s&quot; of the settlement house movement: residence, research, and reform. These involved &quot;close cooperation with the neighborhood people, scientific study of the causes of poverty and dependence, communication of these facts to the public, and persistent pressure for [legislative and social] reform...&quot; Hull House conducted careful studies of the Near West Side, Chicago community, which became known as &quot;The Hull House Neighborhood&quot;. These studies enabled the Hull House residents to confront the establishment, eventually partnering with them in the design and implementation of programs intended to enhance and improve the opportunities for success by the largely immigrant population.

According to Christie and Gauvreau (2001), while the Christian settlement houses sought to Christianize, Jane Addams, &quot;had come to epitomize the force of secular humanism.&quot; Her image was, however, &quot;reinvented&quot; by the Christian churches. According to the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, &quot;Some social settlements were linked to religious institutions. Others, like Hull-House [co-founded by Addams], were secular.&quot;

In 1895, the Hull-House Association released &quot;Hull-House Maps and Papers.&quot; This publication consisted of essays authored by Hull-House residents and collaborators, overseen by Jane Addams. Alongside the essays, the book featured two maps illustrating the spatial distribution of immigrants from eighteen different nationalities residing within a one-third square mile radius around Hull-House. &quot;The book was notable for its impact on the University of Chicago Sociology Department ... Development of mapping as a statistical technique to reveal social group patterns became a major contribution of the Chicago School.&quot;

Settlement houses were established on the principles of Christian Socialism and the Social Gospel, which held the belief that the application of social sciences could address the challenges faced by urban residents in industrialized societies. Jane strongly asserted that the primary beneficiaries of the efforts at the settlement house were the residents themselves, rather than the local community. Nevertheless, Jane recognized that to effectively tackle these issues, it was essential to comprehend them thoroughly. Consequently, she mobilized teams to investigate social problems in the vicinity of Hull-House.

Hassencahl asserts that Hull-House evolved into a globally significant hub of intellectual activity, attracting leaders from various fields to engage in teaching, studying, and research. Deegan further elaborates that for women sociologists, Hull-House held a similar significance as the University of Chicago did for their male counterparts, serving as a central institution for research and social discourse. Alongside disseminating their discoveries, the insights derived from these inquiries played a crucial role in advocating for legislative reforms aimed at improving the conditions of immigrants and the impoverished.

Jane didn&#x27;t intend to become a sociologist. In the preface of Hull-House Maps and Papers, she mentioned that the residents of the settlement house typically didn&#x27;t engage in sociological inquiries, which she distinguished from investigations into labor abuses or factory conditions. She expressed her opposition to viewing the neighborhood as a laboratory, emphasizing that Hull-House aimed to assist the neighbors rather than study them. However, she ended up becoming a sociologist. Faderman describes Jane as &quot;probably the first to take the work of female social scientists seriously.&quot; She was one of the founding members of the American Sociological Association, established in 1905. Additionally, she lectured on sociology at both the University of Chicago Extension and the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy.

Jane&#x27;s perspective aside, Hull-House represented a form of experimentation. Fortunately, it was replicable. By 1900, nearly 100 settlement houses akin to Hull-House had emerged across the United States. Moreover, Jane spurred a shift in the objectives of existing groups. Women&#x27;s clubs, initially established by affluent women for cultural enrichment, joined forces to establish the Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, directing their efforts towards civic endeavors such as eradicating child labor, establishing public libraries, and reforming tenements.

During that era, a familiar dichotomy emerged, resonating with contemporary readers. Male members of the University of Chicago Sociology Department tended to maintain a distance from their subjects. They operated from their offices within the university, using coordination for their studies. Women sociologists were often viewed by their male counterparts as mere data collectors. Conversely, women sociologists perceived sociology as a tool. While men regarded the data they gathered and the insights they derived as the ultimate goal, women viewed them as indicators of issues needing resolution. Their envisioned role was that of problem solvers.

Post-World War II, there arose a trend to quantify and &quot;scientify&quot; all aspects of what are now recognized as the social sciences. Consequently, sociology was embraced by business and science, with male faculty assuming predominant roles. By 1920, at the University of Chicago, all female professors were transferred from the Sociology Department to the Department of Social Services.

==Hull House neighborhood==
One of the first newspaper articles ever written about Hull House quotes the following invitation sent to the residents of the Hull House neighborhood. It begins with: &quot;Mio Carissimo Amico&quot;...and is signed, &quot;Le Signorine&quot;, Jane Addams and Ellen Starr. That invitation to the community, written during the first year of Hull House&#x27;s existence, suggests that the inner core of what Addams labeled &quot;The Hull House Neighborhood&quot; was overwhelmingly Italian at that time. &quot;10,000 Italians lived between the river and Halsted Street.&quot;

By all accounts, the greater Hull House neighborhood (Chicago&#x27;s Near West Side) was a mix of various ethnic groups that had immigrated to Chicago. There was no discrimination of race, language, creed, or tradition for those who entered the doors of the Hull House. Every person was treated with respect. The Bethlehem-Howard Neighborhood Center records substantiate that, &quot;Germans and Jews resided south of that inner core (south of twelfth street)...The Greek delta formed by Harrison, Halsted and Blue Island Streets served as a buffer to the Irish residing to the south and the Canadian–French to the northwest. From the river on the east end, on out to the western ends of what came to be known as &quot;Little Italy&quot;, from Roosevelt Road on the south to the Harrison Street delta on the north, became the port-of-call for Italians who continued to immigrate to Chicago from the shores of southern Italy until a quota system was implemented in 1924 for most Southern Europeans.

The Greektown and Maxwell Street residents, along with the remnants of other immigrant groups living on the outer fringes of the Hull House Neighborhood, disappeared long before the physical demise of Hull House. The exodus of most ethnic groups began shortly after the turn of the twentieth century. Their businesses, e.g. Greektown and Maxwell Street, however, remained. Italian Americans were the only immigrant group that endured as a vibrant on-going community. That community came to be known as &quot;Little Italy&quot;. Taylor Street&#x27;s Little Italy, the inner core of Addams&#x27; &quot;Hull House Neighborhood&quot;, remained as the laboratory upon which the social and philanthropic groups of Hull House elitists had tested their theories and formulated their challenges to the establishment.

The synergy between Taylor Street&#x27;s Little Italy and the Hull House complex; i.e., the settlement house and its summer camp, the Bowen Country Club, is well documented. Dr. Alice Hamilton, an early member of that elite Hull House hierarchy, wrote in her autobiography, &quot;Those Italian women knew what a baby needed, far better than my Ann Arbor professors did.&quot; The ancillary literature between, among and about members of Hull House&#x27;s inner sanctum of sociologists and philanthropists is littered with such comments, reinforcing the relationship that existed between Taylor Street&#x27;s Little Italy and Hull House. A review of the ethnic composition of those who registered for and utilized the services provided by the Hull House complex, during its 74 years as a tenant of the near-west side, suggests an ethnic bias. Of the 257 known WWII veterans who were alumni of the Bowen Country Club, &quot;virtually all had a vowel at the end of their names...denoting their Italian heritage.&quot;

A historic picture, &quot;Meet the Hull House Kids,&quot; was taken on a summer day in 1924 by Wallace K. Kirkland Sr., Hull House Director. He later became a top photographer with &quot;Life&quot;. The twenty Hull House Kids were erroneously described as young boys, of Irish ancestry, posing in the Dante School yard on Forquer Street (now Arthington Street). It circulated the world as a &quot;poster child&quot; of sorts for the Hull House social experiment. On April 5, 1987, over a half century later, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; refuted the contention that the Hull House Boys were of Irish ancestry. In doing so, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; article listed the names of each of the young boys. All twenty boys were first-generation Italian-Americans, all with vowels at the end of their names. &quot;They grew up to be lawyers and mechanics, sewer workers and dump truck drivers, a candy shop owner, a boxer and a mob boss.&quot;

Because of the immigrants&#x27; loneliness for their homeland, Addams started hosting ethnic evenings at Hull House. This would include ethnic food, dancing, music, and maybe a short lecture on a topic of interest. Some of the themed evenings were Italian, Greek, German, Polish, etc. Ellen Gates Starr described one Italian evening as having the room packed full with people. One of the ladies who attended &quot;recited a patriotic poem with great spirit&quot; and everyone was moved by it.

===Accomplishments===

Throughout the first two decades, along with thousands of immigrants from the surrounding area, Hull House attracted many female residents who later became prominent and influential reformers at various levels. At the beginning, Addams and Starr volunteered as on-call doctors when the real doctors either didn&#x27;t show up or weren&#x27;t available. They acted as midwives, saved babies from neglect, prepared the dead for burial, nursed the sick, and sheltered domestic violence victims. For example, one Italian bride had lost her wedding ring and in turn was beaten by her husband for a week. She sought shelter at the settlement and it was granted to her. Also, a baby born with a cleft palate was unwanted by his mother so he was kept at the Hull House for six weeks after an operation. In another case, a woman was about to give birth to an illegitimate baby, so none of the Irish matrons would touch it. Addams and Starr stepped in and delivered this helpless little one. Finally, a female Italian immigrant was so thrilled about fresh roses at one of the Hull House receptions that she insisted they had come from Italy. She had never seen anything as beautiful in America despite the fact that she lived within ten blocks of a florist shop. Her limited view of America came from the untidy street she lived on and the long struggle to adapt to American ways. The settlement was also gradually drawn into advocating for legislative reforms at the municipal, state and federal levels, addressing issues such as child labor, women&#x27;s suffrage, healthcare reform and immigration policy. Some claim that the work of the Hull House marked the beginning of what we know today as &quot;Social Welfare&quot;.

At the neighborhood level, Hull House established the city&#x27;s first public playground, bathhouse, and public gymnasium (in 1893), pursued educational and political reform, and investigated housing, working, and sanitation issues. The playground opened on May Day in 1893, located on Polk Street. Families dressed in party attire and came to join the celebration that day. Addams had studied child behavior and painfully concluded that &quot;children robbed of childhood were likely to become dull, sullen men and women working mindless jobs, or criminals for whom the adventure of crime became the only way to break out of the bleakness of their lives&quot; Addams&#x27; thinking regarding the importance of childhood play opportunities contributed to a national conversation about the need for playgrounds and a movement that started the Playground Association of America Also, one volunteer, Jenny Dow, started a kindergarten class for children left at the settlement while their mothers worked in the sweatshops. Within three weeks, Dow had 24 registered kindergartners and 70 on a waiting list. At the municipal level, their pursuit of legal reforms led to the first juvenile court in the United States, and their work influenced urban planning and the transition to a branch library system. At the state level Hull House influenced legislation on child labor laws, occupational safety and health provisions, compulsory education, immigrant rights, and pension laws. These experiences translated to success at the federal level, working with the settlement house network to champion national child labor laws, women&#x27;s suffrage, a children&#x27;s bureau, unemployment compensation, workers&#x27; compensation, and other elements of the Progressive agenda during the first two decades of the twentieth century.

Jane Addams and many other Hull House residents such as Florence Kelley and Julia Lathrop inspired and stimulated social reforms. Hull House residents generated action. What is less well known, is that Hull House also generated a unique philosophy often described as feminist pragmatism. Philosophy is generally associated with academia. Plato, is known for establishing the academy (387 BCE), which was a forerunner of universities. Men dominated this world of thought --philosophy. Hull House offered an alternative location where women could debate, reflect, ponder and make sense of urban life through the prism of feminine experience. According to Maurice Hamington Hull House was an incubator of ideas where feminist pragmatism was jump started. The Hull House philosophy, contrasted sharply with the approach of Plato. He used geometry and math as a spring board to a theory of Forms, which were &quot;ideal, eternal, unchanging and pleasingly independence of earthly visible things. Addams, on the other hand, was not interested in abstract truth. She wanted her philosophic approach to incorporate the messy world of lived experience - with emphasis on the under explored world of women&#x27;s experience. Rather than focusing on fixed individual characteristics (virtues), her social ethics engaged the individual in broader society and focused on a social responsibility and participatory democracy. In 1897, Alice Hamilton after graduating from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine joined Hull House and founded one of the first child welfare and outpatient pediatric clinic.

===Teachings===

Later, the settlement branched out and offered services to ameliorate some of the effects of poverty. A public dispensary provided nutritious food for the sick as well as a daycare center and public baths. Among the courses Hull House offered was a bookbinding course, which was timely — given the employment opportunities in the growing printing trade. Hull House was well known for its success in aiding American assimilation, especially with immigrant youth. Hull House became the center of the movement to promote hand workmanship as a moral regenerative force. The Hull-House Kilns program was directed by Myrtle Merritt French. Under the direction of Laura Dainty Pelham their theater group performed the Chicago premiers of several plays by John Galsworthy, Henrik Ibsen, and George Bernard Shaw, and was given credit for founding the American Little Theatre Movement. The success of Hull House led Paul Kellogg to refer to the group as the &quot;Great Ladies of Halsted Street&quot;.

The objective of Hull House, as stated in its charter, was: &quot;To provide a center for a higher civic and social life; to institute and maintain educational and philanthropic enterprises, and to investigate and improve the conditions in the industrial districts of Chicago.&quot;

==The building and museum==

Hull House was located in Chicago, Illinois, and took its name from the Italianate mansion built by real estate magnate Charles Jerald Hull (1820–1889) at 800 South Halsted Street in 1856. The building was located in what had once been a fashionable part of town, but by 1889, when Addams was searching for a location for her experiment, it had descended into squalor. This was partly due to the rapid and overwhelming influx of immigrants into the Near West Side neighborhood. Charles Hull granted his former home to his cousin Helen Culver, who in turn granted it to Addams on a 25-year rent-free lease. By 1907, Addams had acquired 13 buildings surrounding Hull&#x27;s mansion. Between 1889 and 1935, Addams and Ellen Gates Starr continuously redeveloped the building. In 1912, the Bowen Country Club summer camp was added to complete the Hull House complex. The facility remained at the original location until it was purchased in 1963 by what was then called the University of Illinois-Circle Campus. The development of University of Illinois-Circle Campus required the demolition of most of the Hull House buildings and the 1967 restoration to the original building by Frazier, Raftery, Orr and Fairbank removed Addams&#x27;s third floor addition. In addition to the mansion, of the dozen additional buildings only the craftsman style dining hall (built in 1905 and designed by Pond &amp; Pond) survives and it was moved from its original site to be next to the mansion.

===The haunting of Hull House===
Addams noted that upon moving in, the building had a &quot;half-skeptical reputation for a haunted attic.&quot; Over the years, numerous stories of ghosts and hauntings have surrounded Hull House, making it a stop on many of the &quot;ghosts in Chicago&quot; tours. Charles Hull&#x27;s wife had died in the house in 1860 and is sometimes thought to haunt it. Other candidates for resident ghosts include the many people who died there of natural causes in the 1870s when it was used as a home for the aged by the Little Sisters of the Poor.

In 1913, another Hull House ghost story began circulating. According to this legend, after a man claimed that he would rather have the Devil in his house than a picture of The Virgin Mary, his child was born with pointed ears, horns, scale-covered skin, and a tail. The mother was said to have taken the baby to Hull House, where Addams was said to have attempted to have it baptized and wound up locking it in the attic. While initially annoyed about the story, which had no basis in fact, Addams became fascinated by the effect the episode had on old women in the neighborhood and used the episode as a basis for her book &quot;The Long Road of Woman&#x27;s Memory&quot;.

While a great many erroneous stories have circulated about the building, Addams is known to have spoken to several friends about one of the front bedrooms on the second floor being haunted – she and a friend once thought they saw a &quot;woman in white&quot; ghost there, and the same ghost was later seen by a group of girls when the room was used as a dressing room for the adjacent theater. Though Addams called it &quot;haunted,&quot; she seems to have been more amused than frightened by it.

==Theater==
Addams felt that the community benefits from theater plays and thus established an amateur theater in the Hull House in 1899. &quot;The neighborhood Greeks performed the classic plays of antiquity in their own language and the children of European immigrants produced Shakespeare&quot; as well as others. Early one December, the Greeks performed &quot;Odysseus in Chicago&quot;. The auditorium was filled with a multi-ethnic crowd and packed too close for comfort. The audience was very eager and gave the performers &quot;rapt attention.&quot; They watched neighbors and co-workers execute this primitive play, but it was very powerful, plausible, and personal. The actors seemed to pay &quot;tribute to a noble ancestry&quot; and plea for the respect of the audience. Indeed, they did gain this respect because it was said that not even trained college students could give the same play with as much zeal and patriotism. America&#x27;s improvisational theatre scene has its roots in Hull House, as Viola Spolin, noted improvisational techniques instructor, taught classes and developed her techniques at Hull House. In 1963, when road tours of Broadway productions became common, the Hull House Theater in the Jane Addams Center at 3212 North Broadway fostered the development of Chicago Theater companies for the rest of the century. Founder Robert Sickinger created an environment to nourish young talent with professionalism.

==Since the 1930s==
Addams was head resident until her death in 1935. Hull House continued to serve the community surrounding the Halsted location until it was displaced by the urban branch campus of the University of Illinois in the 1960s. Until 2012, the social service center role was performed throughout the city at various locations under an umbrella organization, the Jane Addams Hull House Association. The original Hull House building itself is a museum, part of the College of Architecture and the Arts at the University of Illinois Chicago, and is open to the public.

The Jane Addams Hull House Association was one of Chicago&#x27;s largest nonprofit social welfare organizations. Its mission was to improve social conditions for underserved people and communities by providing creative, innovative programs and by advocating for related public policy reforms. The Association had more than 50 programs at over 40 sites throughout Chicago and served approximately 60,000 individuals, families, and community members every year.

The Jane Addams Hull-House Museum is part of the College of Architecture and the Arts at the University of Illinois Chicago and serves as a memorial to Addams and other resident social reformers, whose work influenced the lives of their immigrant neighbors, as well as national and international public policy. The museum and its programs connect the work of Hull House residents to important contemporary social issues. The Museum&#x27;s collection includes over 1,100 artifacts related to Hull House history and over 100 oral interviews conducted with people who have shared their stories about Hull House and the surrounding neighborhood.

===Hull House Association closure===
Because of its heavy reliance on public support—as much as 85 percent of its revenue came from such sources—Hull House Association had essentially become an arm of government, unlike anything Ms. Addams might recognize today. When Clarence Wood, then the head of Chicago&#x27;s Human Relations Commission, took over in 2000, he promised to move toward more private fundraising. But that effort appears to have failed to bring in more than a few million dollars in any given year, accounting for less than 10 percent of the agency&#x27;s funding in most of the last decade, according to financial statements filed with the IRS and the Illinois attorney general&#x27;s office.

On January 19, 2012, it was announced that Jane Addams Hull House Association would close in the spring of 2012 and file for bankruptcy due to financial difficulties, after almost 122 years. On Friday, January 27, 2012, Hull House closed unexpectedly and all employees received their final paychecks. Employees learned at time of closing that they would not receive severance pay or earned vacation pay or healthcare coverage. Union officials said that the agency closed while owing employees more than $27,000 in unpaid expense reimbursement claims. The University of Illinois Chicago&#x27;s Jane Addams Hull-House Museum (unaffiliated with the agency), however, remains open.

<text>Diodotus I Soter (Greek: , &quot;Diódotos Sōtḗr&quot;; c. 300 BC – c. 235 BC) was the first Hellenistic king of Bactria. Diodotus was initially satrap of Bactria, but became independent of the Seleucid empire around 255 BC, establishing the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. In about 250 BC, Diodotus repelled a Parthian invasion of Bactria by Arsaces. He minted an extensive coinage and administered a powerful and prosperous new kingdom. He died around 235 BC and was succeeded by his son Diodotus II. 

His rule was recounted by Apollodorus of Artemita in the &quot;Parthian History&quot;, but this text is lost, and surviving literary sources only mention him in passing. Thus, most details of Diodotus&#x27; life have to be reconstructed from numismatics and brief references by Justin and other historians.

==Background and satrapy==
The region of Bactria, which encompassed the Oxus river Valley in modern Afghanistan and Tajikistan, was conquered by Alexander between 329 and 327 BC and he settled a number of his veterans in the region. In the wars which followed Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, the region was largely left to its own devices, but it was incorporated in the Seleucid empire by Seleucus I between 308 and 305 BC, along with the rest of the territories that Alexander had conquered in Iran and Central Asia. Seleucus entrusted the region to his son and co-regent, Antiochus I, around 295 BC. Between 295 and 281 BC, Antiochus I established firm Seleucid control over the region. The region was divided into a number of satrapies (provinces), of which Bactria was one. Antiochus founded or refounded a number of cities on the Greek model in the region and he opened a number of mints to produce coinage on the Attic weight standard. After Antiochus I succeeded his father as ruler of the Seleucid empire in 281 BC, he entrusted the east to his own son, Antiochus II, who remained in this position until he in turn succeeded to the throne in 261 BC.

Diodotus became Seleucid satrap of Bactria during Antiochus II&#x27;s reign. The nature of the Bactrian satrapy, traditionally assigned to an Achaemenid Crown Prince, suggests Diodotus&#x27; prominence. According to some scholars, he may have later married a daughter of Antiochus II (as his second marriage); although this is uncertain and Tarn&#x27;s genealogical assertions are controversial. The Babylonian Astronomical Diaries record that an unnamed Bactrian satrap sent a herd of twenty war elephants to Babylon at the beginning of 273 BC to join the Seleucid forces fighting against Ptolemaic Egypt in the First Syrian War. This satrap may have been Diodotus, or a predecessor. Archaeological evidence for the period comes largely from excavations of the city of Ai-Khanoum, where this period saw the expansion of irrigation networks, the construction and expansion of civic buildings, and some military activity, probably raiding by nomads from the Central Asian steppe. As satrap, Diodotus was probably involved in these matters, though the specifics are not recoverable.

==Secession from the Seleucid realm==

At some point, Diodotus seceded from the Seleucid empire, establishing his realm as an independent kingdom, known in modern scholarship as the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom. The event is mentioned briefly by the Roman historian Justin:

The date of this event is unclear. The literary evidence is as follows:
* Justin says that the rebellion occurred &#x27;around the same time&#x27; as the Parni conquest of Parthia from the Seleucid realm, but his dating of this event is confused—he places it in 256 BC, but during the reign of Seleucus II (246-225 BC).
* Strabo further claims that Arsaces, the leader of the Parni, had been based in Bactria before the conquest. He says that Diodotus drove Arsaces out of Bactria and maintained hostilities against the Parni.
* Ammianus Marcellinus places the Parthian rebellion in the reign of a Seleucus (II?).
* Arrian&#x27;s lost &quot;Parthian History&quot; seems to have claimed that the Seleucid satrap who was overthrown by the Parthians was appointed to that position by Antiochus II.
* Appian states that the Parthian rebellion took place in 246 BC, during the Third Syrian War, in the wake of Ptolemy III&#x27;s conquest of Seleucid Syria and Babylon. The Adulis inscription set up by Ptolemy III to celebrate this event claims that Bactria was among Ptolemy&#x27;s conquests, which is hyperbole but might indicate that Bactria had been part of the Seleucid empire up to this point.

Different scholars have argued for a &#x27;High Chronology&#x27; which places Diodotus&#x27; independence around 255 BC in the reign of Antiochus II, or a &#x27;Low Chronology&#x27; which dates the secession around 245 BC at the beginning of the reign of Seleucus II. Several scholars have expressed pessimism about the possibility of resolving this debate with the available evidence. Frank Holt argues that the secession should be seen as a gradual process in which Diodotus and other eastern Seleucid satraps aggregated ever more autonomy, rather than a single event. In his opinion, the process probably began in the 250s BC and was completed in the reign of Seleucus II. By contrast, Jens Jakobssen argues that Diodotus assumed independence suddenly in 246 or 245 BC, in the confusion of the Third Syrian War, during which it briefly appeared that Ptolemy III had conquered the Seleucid core territories of Syria and Mesopotamia. 

The limited archaeological evidence reveals no signs of discontinuity or destruction in this period. The transition from Seleucid rule to independence thus seems to have been accomplished peacefully. Coins of Antiochus I were over sixty times more common than those of Antiochus II in the excavations at Ai Khanoum, which might indicate that Bactria shifted out of the Seleucid orbit early in Antiochus II&#x27;s reign, or that Antiochus I&#x27;s coinage continued to be minted posthumously.

Whether gradual or quick, the culmination of the process was apparently Diodotus&#x27; proclamation of himself as king. He divided the territories under his control into a number of satrapies, each with its own satrap. Two of these satrapies, Aspionus and Turiva (perhaps Tapuria) were established on the border with Parthia. Archaeologists have identified a number of other settlements which might be other satrapal capitals, including Yemshi Tepe in Sar-e Pol, Dalverzin Tepe in the Surxondaryo river valley, and Kobadian in the Kofarnihon river valley. It is unclear whether Diodotus based himself and his main mint at Ai-Khanoum or Bactra.

The literary sources stress the prosperity of the new kingdom. Justin calls it &quot;the extremely prosperous empire of the thousand cities of Bactria.&quot;, while the geographer Strabo says:
Diodotus continued to be hostile to the Parthians for the rest of his reign. Justin emphasises Arsaces&#x27; precarious position, opposed by the Seleucids to his west and Diodotus to the east—he is unclear about whether this opposition was co-ordinated. Before archaeological evidence became available, it was generally assumed that the Parni conquest of Parthia had decisively cut Bactria off from contact with Seleucid authority and Greek culture.

Diodotus died during the reign of Seleucus II, sometime around 235 BC, probably of natural causes. He was succeeded by his son Diodotus II. The new king concluded a peace with the Parthians and supported Arsaces when Seleucus II attacked him around 228 BC. Diodotus II was subsequently killed by an usurper, Euthydemus, who founded the Euthydemid dynasty.

==Coinage==

Before Diodotus came to power, there was already a mint in Bactria based at Ai-Khanoum or at Bactra, which minted royal coinage in the name of the Seleucid sovereign, with the reigning Seleucid king&#x27;s portrait on the obverse and an image of Apollo, the Seleucid patron deity, sitting on an omphalus. As satrap, Diodotus continued to issue these coins, in the name of Antiochus II. This included gold staters, silver tetradrachms, drachms, and hemidrachms, and some bronze coins. None of them seem to have been issued in great quantity.

On Frank Holt&#x27;s interpretation, Diodotus introduced a new coinage while still satrap, which consisted of a large number of silver tetradrachms and, later, a small number of gold staters. These coins have the head of a male figure on the obverse, presumably Diodotus himself, shown wearing the diadem—a band of cloth wrapped around the head, with two strips hanging down the back, which had been the standard symbol of Hellenistic kingship since the time of Alexander the Great. The image seems to gradually age over time, suggesting that it was intended as a realistic portrait of Diodotus. The reverse of these coins abandoned the Seleucid god Apollo in favour of a depiction of Zeus preparing to throw his thunderbolt. The choice of Zeus may have been intended as a reference to Diodotus himself whose name meant &#x27;Gift of Zeus&#x27; in Greek. Alternatively, it may look back to early coinage struck by Seleucus I, from which the reverse image is taken. The legend on the reverse of these coins still reads (&#x27;Of King Antiochus&#x27;). The coinage thus clearly proclaimed Diodotus&#x27; authority, but retained some ambiguity about the extent of his independence from the Seleucids. An alternative interpretation advanced by Jens Jakobsson is that this is the coinage of a separate king Antiochus Nicator, whom he interprets as a younger son of grandson of Diodotus, and whose rule he would place around the 220s BC. 

Towards the end of this series, a small wreath appears on the reverse to the left of Zeus. The wreath was a Greek symbol of victory. Frank Holt suggests that it commemorated a victory over the Parthians and that this victory was also the source of Diodotus&#x27; epithet &quot;soter&quot; (savour). Other Hellenistic kings, such as Antiochus I Soter and Attalus I Soter of Pergamum took this title to commemorate victories over existential barbarian threats. Diodotus may have done the same. This may further have been the occasion of Diodotus I&#x27;s assumption of the royal title of king (&quot;basileus&quot;)—as a similar victory was for Attalus I.

The date at which this coinage began is not clear. Frank Holt suggests it was around 250 BC. The coinage seems to have been minted simultaneously at two mints—one with a more aged portrait (&#x27;Series A&#x27;) and the other with a younger portrait (&#x27;Series C and E&#x27;). The mint of &#x27;Series A &amp; C&#x27; is generally identified with the Ai-Khanoum/Bactra mint, that of &#x27;Series E&#x27; has not been localised. Holt proposes that the younger portrait depicts Diodotus II, perhaps junior co-regent with Diodotus I. After a break, both mints produce coins with the younger portrait and with the legend now reading (&#x27;Of Diodotus&#x27;, Series D and F). Holt suggests that this break marks the death of Diodotus I and accession of Diodotus II.

A few tetradrachm coins depicting Diodotus I in a more &#x27;idealising&#x27; guise were issued late in Diodotus II&#x27;s reign (&#x27;Series B&#x27;). Diodotus appears also on coins struck in his memory by the later Graeco-Bactrian kings Agathocles and Antimachus. These coins imitate the original design of the tetradrachms issued by Diodotus I, but with a legend on the obverse identifying the king as (&#x27;Of Diodotus Soter&#x27;).

Diodotus also issued a bronze coinage (&#x27;Series G&#x27;). This coinage consisted of two denominations: a &#x27;double&#x27; (c. 8.4 grammes, 20-24 millimetres in diameter) and a &#x27;single&#x27; (4.2 g, 14–18 mm)—possibly worth 1/48 of a silver drachm. All denominations bore the head of Hermes wearing a petasus hat on the obverse, and two caducei (winged staffs, an attribute of Hermes) crossing one another on the reverse, with a legend reading (&#x27;Of King Antiochus&#x27;). There is a similar break to the silver and gold coins, after which the bronzes are issued with the legend (&#x27;Of Diodotus&#x27;, &#x27;Series H&#x27;). These bronze coins were found in very large numbers in the excavations of Ai-Khanoum.

The only attested relative of Diodotus I is his son and successor, Diodotus II Theos. A younger son may have been Antiochus I Nicator. Tarn interpreted later Bactrian coinage as indicating that Diodotus had a daughter who married Euthydemus I, and was involved in the assassination of Diodotus and usurpation of the throne; then became Queen regent until her son Demetrius I ascended to the throne. There is no explicit evidence for this daughter&#x27;s existence and the speculative nature of Tarn&#x27;s genealogical reconstructions has been criticised in subsequent scholarship. For the illustration of these relationships, see Family tree of the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kings (at the Diodotids).

<text>The Bristol Hercules is a 14-cylinder two-row radial aircraft engine designed by Sir Roy Fedden and produced by the Bristol Engine Company starting in 1939. It was the most numerous of their single sleeve valve (Burt-McCollum, or Argyll, type) designs, powering many aircraft in the mid-World War II timeframe.

The Hercules powered a number of aircraft types, including Bristol&#x27;s own Beaufighter heavy fighter design, although it was more commonly used on bombers. The Hercules also saw use in civilian designs, culminating in the 735 and 737 engines for such as the Handley Page Hastings C1 and C3 and Bristol Freighter. The design was also licensed for production in France by SNECMA.

==Design and development==
Shortly after the end of World War I, the Shell company, Asiatic Petroleum, commissioned Harry Ricardo to investigate problems of fuel and engines. His book was published in 1923 as “The Internal Combustion Engine”. Ricardo postulated that the days of the poppet valve were numbered and that a sleeve valve alternative should be pursued.

The rationale behind the single sleeve valve design was two-fold: to provide optimum intake and exhaust gas flow in a two-row radial engine, improving its volumetric efficiency and to allow higher compression ratios, thus improving its thermal efficiency. The arrangement of the cylinders in two-row radials made it very difficult to utilise four valves per cylinder, consequently all non-sleeve valve two- and four-row radials were limited to the less efficient two-valve configuration. Also, as combustion chambers of sleeve-valve engines are uncluttered by valves, especially hot exhaust valves, so being comparatively smooth they allow engines to work with lower octane number fuels using the same compression ratio. Conversely, the same octane number fuel may be utilised while employing a higher compression ratio, or supercharger pressure, thus attaining either higher economy or power output. The downside was the difficulty in maintaining sufficient cylinder and sleeve lubrication.

Manufacturing was also a major problem. Sleeve valve engines, even the mono valve Fedden had elected to use, were extremely difficult to make. Fedden had experimented with sleeve valves in an inverted V-12 as early as 1927 but did not pursue that engine any further. Reverting to nine cylinder engines, Bristol had developed a sleeve valve engine that would actually work by 1934, introducing their first sleeve-valve designs in the class Perseus and the class Aquila that they intended to supply throughout the 1930s. Aircraft development in the era was so rapid that both engines quickly ended up at the low-power end of the military market and, in order to deliver larger engines, Bristol developed 14-cylinder versions of both. The Perseus evolved into the Hercules, and the Aquila into the Taurus.

These smooth-running engines were largely hand-built, which was incompatible with the needs of wartime production. At that time, the tolerances were simply not sufficiently accurate to ensure the mass production of reliable engines. Fedden drove his teams mercilessly, at both Bristol and its suppliers, and thousands of combinations of alloys and methods were tried before a process was discovered which used centrifugal casting to make the sleeves perfectly round. This final success arrived just before the start of the Second World War.

In 1937 Bristol acquired a Northrop Model 8A-1, the export version of the A-17 attack bomber, and modified it as a testbed for the first Hercules engines.

In 1939 Bristol developed a modular engine installation for the Hercules, a so-called &quot;power-egg&quot;, allowing the complete engine and cowling to be fitted to any suitable aircraft.

A total of over 57,400 Hercules engines were built.

<doc id="160707" wikidata="Q315913" url="?curid=160707" title="Arsaces I of Parthia">
<text>Arsaces I (; from ; in &quot;Aršak&quot;) was the first king of Parthia, ruling from 247 BC to 217 BC, as well as the founder and eponym of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia. The leader of the Parni, one of the three tribes of the Dahae confederacy, Arsaces founded his dynasty in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the satrapy of Parthia (now shared between Turkmenistan and Iran) from Andragoras, who had rebelled against the Seleucid Empire. He spent the rest of his reign consolidating his rule in the region, and successfully stopped the Seleucid efforts to reconquer Parthia. Due to Arsaces&#x27; achievements, he became a popular figure amongst the Arsacid monarchs, who used his name as a royal honorific. By the time of his death, Arsaces had laid the foundations of a strong state, which would eventually transform into an empire under his great-grandnephew, Mithridates I, who assumed the ancient Near Eastern royal title of King of Kings. Arsaces was succeeded by his son Arsaces II.

Literary sources are very scarce on Arsaces, and exclusively come from contradictory Greek and Roman accounts written centuries after his death. As a result, his reign is sparsely known. His existence was even questioned by modern scholars, until new studies and archaeological findings confirmed his identity in the 1960s.

==Name==
&quot;&quot; is the Latin form of the Greek &quot;Arsákēs&quot; (), itself from Parthian &quot;Aršak&quot; (). The name is diminutive of Old Iranian &quot;Aršan&quot;, meaning &quot;hero&quot;. The name was also used by some of the rulers of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, including Artaxerxes II (), whom the Arsacids considered their progenitor.

==Background==

The sources regarding Arsaces&#x27; life differ greatly. He is mostly known from Greek and Roman sources, who were hostile to him and his dynasty due to the later Roman–Parthian Wars. In Iranian national history his descent is traced back to several mythical figures, such as being a descendant of either Kay Kawad, Kay Arash, Dara the son of Homay, or Arash, the heroic archer-figure. The affiliation of Arsaces with Arash is due to the resemblance in their names and Arsaces&#x27; coins imitating him as a bowman. According to Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus, Arsaces was a bandit of low birth, who invaded and conquered Parthia, killing its satrap Andragoras, who had recently declared independence from the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire.

The most accepted theory is the one by the Greek geographer Strabo: according to him, Arsaces was a Scythian or a Bactrian chieftain, who became the leader of the Parni, one of the three tribes of the Dahae confederacy of Central Asia. The Dahae relied their strength completely on horseback, and thus possessed an extremely mobile force, which was able to retreat to the south of the Aral Sea when endangered. Because of this, other empires met complications in their efforts trying to control them.

The Dahae had originally lived between the Jaxartes in the 4th-century BC, but gradually moved southward, possibly in the early 3rd-century BC. They first migrated southeast to Bactria, but were driven away, and as a result changed their course to the west. They gradually started settling in Parthia, a region in the south-eastern part of the Caspian Sea, that almost corresponded to present-day Khorasan Province of Iran and southern Turkmenistan. The region was then under the rule of the Seleucids. By 282/1 BC, Parthia was under considerable Parni influence. The Parni were not the only to migrate to Parthia, as the region was constantly receiving new waves of Iranian migrants from the north.

The Parni were an eastern Iranian tribe, who practised Iranian polytheism. By the middle of the 3rd-century BC, however, they had been assimilated into the local Parthian culture; they adopted Parthian, a north-western Iranian language, and became adherents of the Zoroastrianism religion, even giving themselves Zoroastrian names, such as Arsaces&#x27; father, Phriapites, whose name was derived from Avestan &quot;*Friya pitā&quot; (&quot;father-lover&quot;). Arsaces himself was probably born and raised in Parthia, speaking the Parthian language. According to the French historian Jérôme Gaslain, Arsaces could have arguably spent much of his life in the Seleucid lands, and may even have belonged to the local elite of Parthia.

The Dahae frequently served as horse archers in the armies of Greek rulers, from the Macedonian Alexander the Great () to the Seleucid Antiochus III the Great (). This implies that Arsaces, who is described as an &quot;experienced soldier&quot; in classical records, may have served as a mercenary under the Seleucid rulers or their governors.

== Reign ==
=== Accession and wars ===
In c. 250 BC, Arsaces and his Parni followers seized Astauene, which lay near the Atrek valley. A few years later, probably in c. 247 BC, Arsaces was crowned king in Asaak, a city which he had founded, and which served as the Arsacid royal necropolis. His coronation at Asaak is generally presumed to mark the start of the Arsacid dynasty. Around 245 BC, Andragoras, the governor of the Seleucid province of Parthia, proclaimed his independence from the Seleucid monarch Seleucus II Callinicus (), and made his governorate an independent kingdom. Following the secession of Parthia from the Seleucid Empire and the resultant loss of Seleucid military support, Andragoras had difficulty in maintaining his borders, and about 238 BC—under the command of Arsaces and his brother Tiridates I the Parni invaded Parthia and seized control of Astabene (Astawa) from Andragoras, the northern region of that territory, the administrative capital of which was Kuchan. 
A short while later, the Parni seized the rest of Parthia from Andragoras, killing him in the process. With the conquest of the province, the Arsacids became known as Parthians in Greek and Roman sources. This term has likewise been in regular use by modern western authors as well, however, according to the modern historian Stefan R. Hauser, it &quot;should be abandoned as it conveys an incorrect idea of an ethnic ruling class within the multiethnic, multilingual population&quot;. The neighbouring province of Hyrcania was shortly conquered by the Parni as well. A recovery expedition by the Seleucids under Seleucus II was made in 228 BC, which proved problematic for Arsaces, who was at the same time at war with the Greco-Bactrian ruler Diodotus II (). In order to avoid fighting on two fronts, Arsaces quickly concluded a peace treaty with Diodotus II.

Nevertheless, he was unable to stop the Seleucid expedition and was forced to leave Parthia for Central Asia, where he took refuge with the Apasiacae. The Seleucid conquest proved to be short-lived; due to issues in the western portions of the Seleucid Empire, Seleucus II was forced to leave Parthia, which gave Arsaces the opportunity to regain his lost territories, and most likely also expand his dominion further south. Indeed, Arsaces&#x27; withdrawal to the Apasiacae was perhaps a strategic move, since Seleucus II neither possessed the resources to chase him nor the time to conclude a peace treaty. Arsaces also made an alliance with the Greco-Bactrians, which confirms that contact between the two powers had most likely been established long ago. According to the Roman historian Justin, Arsaces &quot;settled the Parthian government, levied soldiers, built fortresses, and strengthened his towns.&quot; Apart from Asaak, he also founded the city of Dara in Mount Zapaortenon, a place in Parthia. Nisa, likewise founded by Arsaces, would be then used as the royal residence of the Arsacids till the 1st-century BC.

=== Succession ===

For a long time, the line of succession of Arsaces, and to some extent his historicity, had been unclear. The now-deprecated narrative of the foundation of the Arsacid dynasty by Arsaces and his brother Tiridates, who led the Parni in revolt together, was established by Jean Foy-Vaillant in 1725. He and generations of scholars thought that after Arsaces&#x27; death, Tiridates succeeded him as king of the Arsacid dynasty. This led to some different theories, including one that considered Arsaces a legendary figure, whilst attributing the foundation of the Arsacids to Tiridates.

Between 1957 and 1962 published a series of articles with the opposite view: he regarded Arsaces as the founder of the Arsacids, and Tiridates as legendary. This theory has since been supported—with minor divergences—by most scholars, until its confirmation by the discovery in Nisa of an ostracon bearing the name of Arsaces. Moreover, numismatic data and recent analysis of the sources have led to the conclusion that the character of Tiridates is indeed fictional, and that Arsaces continued to rule until his death in 217 BC, where he was succeeded by his son, Arsaces II.

== Coinage ==

In essence, Arsaces&#x27; coins &quot;provided the prototype for all subsequent Arsacid coinage, although itself undergoing a few changes&quot;. Khodadad Rezakhani adds that his coins took many stylistic elements from Seleucids and earlier Achaemenid satrapal issues, but he nonetheless made several innovations that differentiated them from those of his predecessors. According to Alireza Shapour Shahbazi, on his coins, Arsaces &quot;deliberately diverges from Seleucid coins to emphasize his nationalistic and royal aspirations&quot;; the typical Seleucid figure of Apollo seated on the omphalos and holding a bow is replaced by an archer imitating Arsaces, who is seated on a stool (done in the same fashion as some Achaemenid satraps, such as Datames) whilst wearing Sakaian clothing and a soft cap, known as the &quot;bashlyk&quot;. 

Some of the inscriptions on Arsaces&#x27; coins calls him &quot;kārny&quot; (the Greek equivalent being &quot;autokrator&quot;), which was a title carried by prominent Achaemenid military leaders, such as Cyrus the Younger. Through the use of this title, Arsaces was deliberately putting himself above that of a satrap, but simultaneously avoided using the royal title of &quot;basileus&quot; (king), which would imply that he followed the Seleucid regal tradition, which he dismissed. From an Iranian point of view, the title of &quot;basileus&quot; was of minor importance. 

Arsaces seemingly used the city he had founded – Nisa, as a site for his coin mints. The coins of Arsaces were minted in both silver and bronze. Arsaces&#x27; silver &quot;drachms&quot; (which would become the main denomination of the Arsacids) depict his unbearded profile on the obverse, looking to the right, similar to depictions of Seleucid royals on coins. According to Fabrizio Sinisi, similarly, the seated archer on the reverse is turned to the left. The Greek legend ΑΡΣΑΚΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ is inscribed in two vertical lines on the sides of the &quot;drachms&quot;, in similar fashion to Seleucid coins. Regardless of these features, Sinisi notes that Arsaces&#x27; coins are &quot;immediately recognizable as issued by a non-Greek ruler&quot;. For instance, Arsaces wears the pointed soft cap on the obverse, similar to coins of the Achaemenid era, as does the archer on the reverse who is dressed in an Iranian riding costume.

== Legacy ==
Arsaces&#x27; prestige endured long after his death. An everlasting fire in his honour was still guarded in the city of Asaak more than two centuries after his death, as reported by Isidore of Charax. This indicates that the act of declaring a king had a religious importance. It most likely served as the dynastic fire of the Arsacids, possibly created in order to highlight that they were heirs to the Achaemenid Empire. Due to his achievements, he became known as the &quot;father of the nation&quot;, and his name became a royal honorific that was used by all the Arsacid monarchs out of admiration for his achievements. The name also connected the Arsacids with the legendary Kayanian ruler Kavi Arshan, whose dynasty must still have been remembered by the inhabitants of eastern Iran, such as the Parthians and the Dahae. A fictitious claim was later made from the 2nd-century BC onwards by the Arsacids, which represented Arsaces as a descendant of the Achaemenid King of Kings, Artaxerxes II.

The family of Arsaces would rule for four and a half centuries, till it was toppled by the Sasanian Empire in 224 AD. Even then, however, the descendants of Arsaces continued to wield considerable influence and authority; one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, the House of Karen, produced several major figures in Iranian history, such as the 6th-century vizier Bozorgmehr, and the 9th-century prince and rebel Mazyar (). The Arsacids also played an important role in the history of the Caucasus; the principalities of Armenia, Caucasian Albania and Iberia were ruled by branches of the Arsacid dynasty. According to Procopius, even as late as the 6th-century, the Armenian nobility still remembered their Arsacid heritage and the character of Arsaces.

<text>Emily Perkins Bissell (May 31, 1861 – March 8, 1948) was an American social worker and activist, best remembered for introducing Christmas Seals to the United States.

Born in Wilmington, Delaware, she made a name for herself at a young age as the founder of that city&#x27;s first public kindergarten and for her efforts to introduce child labor laws in that state. In 1883, she founded an organization, now known as the West End Neighborhood House that originally provided social services to Wilmington&#x27;s immigrant Irish and German families. Bissell wrote under the pseudonym Priscilla Leonard.

==Anti-suffragism==
Bissell was closely identified with the anti-suffragist movement.
She wrote &quot;The vote is part of man&#x27;s work. Ballot-box, cartridge box, jury box, sentry box all go together in his part of life. Women cannot step in and take the responsibilities and duties of voting with assuming his place very largely&quot;.

In 1896 Bissell published an essay called &quot;The Mistaken Vocation of Shakespeare&#x27;s Heroines&quot;, taking the form of a report of a lecture to suffragettes. The purported speaker launches an attack on the Elizabethan playwright Shakespeare for placing his female characters in unsuitable situations, where they are not allowed to demonstrate their true abilities. For example, instead of having Ophelia as his wife, Hamlet would have been much better served by the more forceful Lady Macbeth, while Macbeth himself would have been better served by Portia.
The audience greets her attack on Shakespeare with delight, ending up shouting &quot;Down with Shakespeare!&quot;
The spoof was supposed to show that it was absurd for women to seek careers.

In 1900, she testified before the United States Senate Committee on Woman&#x27;s Suffrage, arguing that women had no place in politics. In March 1903 she addressed a packed meeting in Concord, New Hampshire speaking against a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would strike out the word &quot;male&quot; from the suffrage clause. The amendment failed to pass.

==Christmas seals==
Several years later, in 1907, she was drawn to the cause of helping people with tuberculosis (TB). She had already heard of an idea in Denmark in which people attached a special stamp to their mail, the proceeds of which would go to fight the disease, and decided to introduce the same idea in Delaware. Her goal was to raise $300 for a local sanitarium, using a bright red stamp she designed herself, and convinced local post offices to sell them for just 1 cent. This way, she believed, even the poorest people could help in the fight against TB.

Though the idea failed at first, Bissell was able to gain enough publicity from a Philadelphia newspaper to make $3,000 for the National Tuberculosis Association, ten times the amount she originally hoped to get. People were intrigued by the idea of Christmas seals, and the following year, Howard Pyle, a notable illustrator from Wilmington, donated the design of the second stamp.

Bissell spent the remainder of her life promoting Christmas stamps and helping to eliminate tuberculosis.

==Death and legacy==

She died on March 8, 1948, and was interred at Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware. An abandoned public hospital outside Wilmington bears her name. In 1980, on the 119th anniversary of her birth, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 15 cent stamp in her honor.

<text>Tiridates II of Parthia was set up by the Parthians against Phraates IV in about 32 BC, but was expelled when Phraates returned with the help of the Scythians. Tiridates fled to Syria, where Augustus allowed him to stay, but refused to support him.

During the next years Tiridates invaded Parthia again; some coins dated from March and May, 26 BC, with the name of a king &quot;Arsaces Philoromaios,&quot; belong to him; on the reverse, they show the king seated on the throne, with Tyche stretching out a palm branch towards him. He was soon expelled again and brought a son of Phraates into Spain to Augustus. Augustus gave the boy back to his father, but declined to surrender &quot;the fugitive slave Tiridates.&quot;

<text>Plovers ( , ) are members of a widely distributed group of wading birds of subfamily Charadriinae. The term &quot;plover&quot; applies to all the members of the subfamily, though only about half of them include it in their name. 

==Species list in taxonomic sequence==
The taxonomy of family Charadriidae is unsettled. At various times the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings of family Charadriidae have been distributed among several subfamilies, with Charadriinae including most of the species. The International Ornithological Congress (IOC) and the Clements taxonomy do not assign species to subfamilies. The South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society (AOS) includes all of the species in Charadriinae. The North American Classification Committee of the AOS and BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; separate the four members of genus &quot;Pluvialis&quot; as subfamily Pluvialinae. 

The IOC recognizes these 69 species of plovers, dotterels, and lapwings in family Charadriidae. They are distributed among 11 genera, some of which have only one species. This list is presented according to the IOC taxonomic sequence and can also be sorted alphabetically by common name and binomial.

==Description==

Plovers are found throughout the world, with the exception of the Sahara and the polar regions, and are characterised by relatively short bills. They hunt by sight, rather than by feel as longer-billed waders like snipes do. They feed mainly on insects, worms or other invertebrates, depending on the habitat, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups. Plovers engage in false brooding, a type of distraction display. Examples include pretending to change position or to sit on an imaginary nest site.

==In folklore==
The European golden plover spends summers in Iceland, and in Icelandic folklore, the appearance of the first plover in the country means that spring has arrived. The Icelandic media always covers the first plover sighting.

<text>Charles Eugene Barrois (21 August 18515 November 1939) was a French geologist and palaeontologist.

==Life==

Barrois was born at Lille and educated at the Jesuit College of St Joseph in that town, where he studied geology under Professor Jules Gosselet.

His first comprehensive work was &quot;Recherches sur le terrain crétacé supérieur de l’Angleterre et de l&#x27;Irlande&quot;, published in the &quot;Mémoires de la societé geologique du Nord&quot; in 1876. In this essay the palaeontological zones in the Chalk and Upper Greensand of Britain were for the first time marked out in detail, and the results of Dr Barrois&#x27;s original researches formed the basis of subsequent work, and were in all leading features confirmed. In 1876 Dr Barrois was appointed a &quot;collaborateur&quot; to the French Geological Survey, and a professor of geology in the University of Lille in 1877. In 1936 he was appointed member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.

In other memoirs, among which may be mentioned those on the Cretaceous rocks of the Ardennes and of the Basin of Oviedo, Spain; on the (Devonian) Calcaire d’Erbray; on the Palaeozoic rocks of Brittany and of northern Spain; and on the granitic and metamorphic rocks of Brittany, Dr Barrois proved himself an accomplished petrologist as well as palaeontologist and field-geologist.

In 1881 he was awarded the Bigsby medal, and in 1901 the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London. He was chosen member of the Institute (Academy of Sciences) in 1904 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London. In 1907, he created the &quot;Musée Houiller&quot; (Carboniferous Museum) alongside the Museum Gosselet in Lille.

Barrois&#x27;s work covered the entire field of geology, and his work was rigorous and based on detailed observation. His fame spread internationally, even before he was recognized in his own country, and he was honored by many European and American academies. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1915. He was made Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur at the age of 37, and was named commander in 1923.

He died at St Genevieve-en-Caux and is buried in the East Cemetery in Lille.

==Family==

He was the brother of zoologist Jules Henri Barrois.

<text>In education, a tutorial is a method of transferring knowledge and may be used as a part of a learning process. More interactive and specific than a book or a lecture, a tutorial seeks to teach by example and supply the information to complete a certain task.

A tutorial can be taken in many forms, ranging from a set of instructions to complete a task to an interactive problem solving session (usually in academia).

== Academia ==

=== Tutorial class ===

In British academic parlance, a tutorial is a small class of one, or only a few students, in which the tutor, a lecturer, or other academic staff member, gives individual attention to the students.

The tutorial system at Oxford and Cambridge is fundamental to methods of teaching at those universities, but it is by no means particular to them; Heythrop College (University of London), for instance, offers a tutorial system but with one-on-one teaching. Another example is Imperial College London, where tutorials in groups of 3 take place. It is rare for newer universities in the UK to have the resources to offer individual tuition; a class of six to eight students is a far more common tutorial size. At Cambridge, a tutorial is known as a supervision.

In Australian, New Zealand, and South African universities, a tutorial (colloquially called a tute or tut) is a class of 10–30 students. Such tutorials are very similar to the Canadian system, although, tutorials are usually led by honours or postgraduate students, known as &#x27;tutors&#x27;.

At the two campuses of St. John&#x27;s College, U.S. and a few other American colleges with a similar version of the Great Books program, a &quot;tutorial&quot; is a class of 12–16 students who meet regularly with the guidance of a tutor. The tutorial focuses on a certain subject area (e.g., mathematics tutorial, language tutorial) and generally proceeds with careful reading of selected primary texts and working through associated exercises (e.g., demonstrating a Euclid proof or translating ancient Greek poetry). Since formal lectures do not play a large part in the St. John&#x27;s College curriculum, the tutorial is the primary method by which certain subjects are studied. However, at St. John&#x27;s the tutorial is considered ancillary to the seminar, in which a slightly larger group of students meets with two tutors for broader discussion of the particular texts on the seminar list.

Some US colleges, such as Williams College, offer tutorials almost identical in structure to that of an Oxbridge tutorial. At Williams, students in tutorials typically work in pairs alongside a professor and meet weekly, while alternately presenting position papers or critiques of their partner&#x27;s paper.

=== Tutorial schools ===

There are also specialized schools for tutoring such as, Kumon and EduHub. These supplemental hands-on learning programs are especially popular in Asia.

=== Conference tutorials ===
Offered as a service or deliverable to its members, conference tutorials are one example of a continuing education activity sponsored by a technical and professional association.

===Private study===
A tutorial in high schools in the United States may also mean a session for homework or other private study.

== Education ==

In documentation and instructional design, tutorials are teaching-level documents that help the learner progress in skill and confidence. Tutorials can take the form of a screen recording (screencast), a written document (either online or downloadable), interactive tutorial, or an audio file, where a person will give step by step instructions on how to do something.

Tutorials usually have the following characteristics:

* A presentation of the view usually explaining and showing the user the user interface
* A demonstration of a process, using examples to show how a workflow or process is completed; often broken up into discrete modules or sections.
* Some method of review that reinforces or tests understanding of the content in the related module or section.
* A transition to additional modules or sections that builds on the instructions already provided. Tutorials can be &quot;linear&quot; or &quot;branching&quot;.

While many writers refer to a mere list of instructions or tips as a tutorial, this usage can be misleading.

== Computer-based tutoring ==
In computer-based education, a tutorial is a computer program whose purpose is to assist users in learning how to use parts of a software product such as an office suite or any other application, operating system interface, programming tool, or video game. There are three kinds of software tutorials: 1) video tutorials that the user views, 2) interactive tutorials where the user follows on-screen instructions (and—in some cases—watches short instruction movies), whereupon they do the tutorial exercises and receives feedback depending on their actions; and 3) webinars where users participate in real-time lectures, online tutoring, or workshops remotely using web conferencing software.

<text>God Bless Tiny Tim is the debut studio album by American musician Tiny Tim, released in 1968 by Reprise. It contains a variety of contemporary and traditional pop standards, including his signature hit song &quot;Tiptoe Through The Tulips&quot;, which was a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 20 hit single. &quot;God Bless Tiny Tim&quot; reached No. 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart during a 32-week run.

&quot;God Bless Tiny Tim&quot; was not available on compact disc until 1998, when in it was issued in Japan only; in 2013, the album was reissued on CD worldwide with eleven bonus tracks including alternate and instrumental versions of the album&#x27;s songs as well as non-album singles.

==Background==
The album was produced by Richard Perry, who had produced Captain Beefheart&#x27;s first album &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; and later produced albums by Barbra Streisand, Harry Nilsson, Rod Stewart, Carly Simon and Ringo Starr. The arrangements are by Artie Butler.

The songs were written by a variety of composers, most from the early 20th century, and most rather obscure; however, &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; was by Sonny Bono, and &quot;Stay Down Here Where You Belong&quot; was by Irving Berlin.

For some of the album, Tiny Tim sings in his unusual falsetto style. However, on a number of songs (&quot;Stay Down Here Where You Belong&quot;, &quot;The Coming Home Party&quot; and others) he sings in a rich baritone, demonstrating his voice&#x27;s range. In &quot;On the Old Front Porch&quot;, &quot;Daddy, Daddy, What Is Heaven Like?&quot; and on &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;, he sings both baritone and falsetto, alternating between the two. A joke in &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; is revealed in the last words where both baritone and falsetto voices unexpectedly sing at once, revealing the apparently agile duet is actually himself singing double-tracked.

<text>Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus also anglicized as was a Gallo-Roman historian from the Celtic Vocontii tribe in Narbonese Gaul who lived during the reign of the emperor Augustus. He was nearly contemporary with Livy.

==Life==
Pompeius Trogus&#x27;s grandfather served under Pompey in his war against Sertorius. Owing to Pompey&#x27;s influence, he was able to obtain Roman citizenship and his family adopted their patron&#x27;s praenomen and nomen Gnaeus Pompeius. Trogus&#x27;s father served under Julius Caesar as his secretary and interpreter. Trogus himself seems to have been a polymath.

==Works==

Following Aristotle and Theophrastus, Pompeius Trogus wrote books on the natural history of animals and plants.

His principal work, however, was his 44-volume &quot;Philippic Histories and the Origin of the Whole World and the Places of the Earth&quot; (&quot;Historiae Philippicae et Totius Mundi Origines et Terrae Situs&quot;), now lost, which, according to its surviving epitome, had as its principal theme the Macedonian Empire founded by but functioned as a general history of all of the parts of the world which fell under the control of Alexander the Great and his successors, with extensive ethnographical and geographical digressions. Trogus began with Ninus, legendary founder of Nineveh, and ended at about the same point as Livy (AD 9). The development of the East from the Assyrians to the Parthians is given extensive coverage while early Roman history and the history of the Iberian Peninsula is briefly glossed in the last two books. The &quot;Philippic Histories&quot; is indebted to earlier Greek historians such as Theopompus (whose own &quot;Philippica&quot; may have suggested Trogus&#x27;s title), Ephorus, Timaeus, and Polybius. On the grounds that such a work was beyond the ability of a Gallo-Roman, it has generally been assumed that Pompeius Trogus did not gather his material directly from these Greek sources but from an existing compilation or translation by a Greek such as the &quot;Universal History&quot; compiled by Timagenes of Alexandria.

==Style==
Pompeius Trogus&#x27;s idea of history was more exacting than that of Sallust and Livy, whom he criticized for their habit of putting elaborate speeches into the mouths of the characters of whom they wrote.

==On the Jews==
Pompeius Trogus discusses the Jews in the context of the history of the Seleucid Empire. Along with the passages in Tacitus, the summary of Pompeius Trogus includes the most extensive description of the Jews in classical Latin literature.
His main overview of the Jews is divided into 3 parts:
1. The Antiquities of the Jews - includes a combination of 3 different traditions: Damascus tradition, Biblical tradition and the Egyptian-Greek tradition hostile to the Exodus
2. A brief geographical description of the land of Judea. 
3. A history of the Jews beginning with the Persian period.

Trogus used Greek sources for his composition. It is possible that the writing of the Jews he used the writings of Timagenes and perhaps also by Posidonius.

==Legacy==
The original text of the &quot;Philippic Histories&quot; has been lost and is preserved only in excerpts by other authors (including Vopiscus, Jerome, and Augustine) and in a loose epitome by the later historian Justin. Justin aimed only to preserve the parts he felt most important or interesting about Pompeius Trogus&#x27;s work, with the last recorded event being the recovery of Roman standards from the Parthians in 20 BC. In the manuscripts of Justin&#x27;s works, however, a separate series of summaries (&quot;&quot;) of the original work have been preserved. Even in their present mutilated state the works are often an important authority for the ancient history of the East.

Pompeius Trogus&#x27;s works on animals and plants were extensively quoted in the works of Pliny the Elder.

<text>Quintus Sertorius ( – 73 or 72 BC) was a Roman general and statesman who led a large-scale rebellion against the Roman Senate on the Iberian Peninsula. Defying the regime of Sulla, Sertorius became the independent ruler of Hispania for most of a decade until his assassination.

Sertorius first became prominent during the Cimbrian War fighting under Gaius Marius, and then served Rome in the Social War. After Lucius Cornelius Sulla blocked Sertorius&#x27; attempt at the plebeian tribunate , following Sulla&#x27;s consulship, Sertorius joined with Cinna and Marius in the civil war of 87 BC. He led in the assault on Rome and restrained the reprisals that followed. During Cinna&#x27;s repeated consulships he was elected praetor, likely in 85 or 84 BC. He criticised Gnaeus Papirius Carbo and other Marians&#x27; leadership of the anti-Sullan forces during the civil war with Sulla and was, late in the war, given command of Hispania.

In late 82 BC Sertorius was proscribed by Sulla and forced from his province. However, he soon returned in early 80 BC, taking in and leading many Marian and Cinnan exiles in a prolonged war, representing himself as a Roman proconsul resisting the Sullan regime at Rome. He gathered support from other Roman exiles and the native Iberian tribes – in part by using his tamed white fawn to claim he had divine favour – and employed irregular and guerrilla warfare to repeatedly defeat commanders sent from Rome to subdue him. He allied with Mithridates VI of Pontus and Cilician pirates in his struggle against the Roman government.

At the height of his power, Sertorius controlled nearly all of Hispania. He successfully sustained his anti-Sullan resistance for many years, despite substantial efforts to subdue him by the Sullan regime and its generals Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius and Pompey. After defeating Pompey in 76 BC at the Battle of Lauron however, he suffered repeated setbacks in later years. By 73 BC his allies had lost confidence in his leadership; his lieutenant Marcus Perperna Veiento assassinated him in 73 or 72 BC. His cause fell in defeat to Pompey shortly thereafter. The Greek biographer and essayist Plutarch chose Sertorius as the focus of one of his biographies in &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, where he was paired with Eumenes of Cardia, one of the post-Alexandrine Diadochi.

==Early life and career==
Sertorius was born in Nursia in Sabine territory around 126 BC. The Sertorius family were of equestrian status. It appears that he did not have any noteworthy ancestors and was thus a novus homo (a &quot;new man&quot;), ie the first of his family to join the Senate. Sertorius&#x27; father died before he came of age and his mother, Rhea, focused all her energies on raising her only son. She made sure he received the best education possible for a young man of his status. In return, according to Plutarch, he became excessively fond of his mother. Having inherited his father&#x27;s clients, like many other young rural aristocrats (&quot;domi nobiles&quot;), Sertorius sought to begin a political career and thus moved to Rome in his mid-to-late teens trying to make it big as an orator and jurist.

Sertorius&#x27; style of rhetoric was &quot;blunt&quot; but effective and bold. His speaking style made a sufficiently negative impression on the young Cicero to merit a special mention in a later treatise on oratory:

After his undistinguished career in Rome as a jurist and an orator, he entered the military. Sertorius&#x27; first recorded campaign was under Quintus Servilius Caepio as a staff officer and ended at the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC, where he showed unusual courage. When the battle was lost, Sertorius escaped while wounded by swimming across the Rhone, apparently still with his weapons and armour. This became a minor legend in antiquity, still remembered in the time of Ammian.

=== Service under Gaius Marius ===

Serving under Gaius Marius, sometime between the autumns of 104 and 102 BC, Sertorius spied on the Germanic tribes that had defeated Caepio, probably disguised as a Gaul. Marius may have sought Sertorius (and other survivors of Arausio) out due to their experience fighting against the Germans, as he likely wanted information regarding enemy tactics and movements. Sertorius probably did not know enough of the German languages to comprehend detailed information, but could report on their numbers and formations: &quot;after seeing or hearing what was of importance&quot;, he returned to Marius. 

Sertorius became well-known and trusted by Marius during his service with him. He almost certainly fought with his commander at the Battle of Aquae Sextiae (now Aix-en-Provence, France) in 102 BC and the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC, in which the Teutones, Ambrones, and Cimbri were decisively defeated. Some scholars believe that Sertorius&#x27; tactics and strategies during his revolt in Hispania greatly resembled those of Marius, and conclude that Sertorius&#x27; earlier service under Marius was an important learning experience. What Sertorius did for the next three years is unclear, but he probably continued to serve in the military. Sertorius eventually travelled to Hispania Citerior to serve its governor, Titus Didius, as military tribune in 97 BC.
=== Pacification of Castulo ===
During his service, Sertorius was posted to the Roman-controlled Oretani (Iberian) town of Castulo. The local Roman garrison was hated by the natives for their lack of discipline and constant drinking, and Sertorius either arrived too late to stop their impropriety or was unable to. The natives invited a neighbouring tribe to free the town of the garrison, and they successfully killed many of the Roman soldiers. Sertorius escaped and gathered the other surviving soldiers, who still had their weapons. He secured the unguarded exits of the town, and then led his men inside, killing all native men of military age irrespective of participation in the revolt. Once he learned some attackers had come from a neighbouring town, he had his men wear the armour of the slain natives and led them there. Probably arriving at dawn, the town opened the gates for Sertorius and his men, convinced they were their warriors returning with loot from the slain Roman garrison. Sertorius then killed many of the towns&#x27; inhabitants and sold the rest into slavery. 

Later in Hispania during his revolt, Sertorius did not quarter his soldiers in native cities, &quot;noting the stupidity of a policy which would cause rebellion in a hostile city, hostility in a neutral one, and corrupt the garrison into the bargain&quot;. The incident at Castulo earned Sertorius considerable fame in Hispania and abroad, aiding his future political career. During his military tribunate Sertorius became familiar with the Iberian methods of war, namely guerrilla warfare, which he would later use to great effect in his revolt.

Didius returned to Rome in the June of 93 BC to celebrate a triumph, but it is not known whether Sertorius immediately returned with him or remained under his successor.

==Social War and civil unrest==
In 92 BC, upon his return from his military tribunate in Hispania, Sertorius was elected quaestor and assigned Cisalpine Gaul in the year 91. His quaestorship was unusual in that he largely governed the province while the actual governor, perhaps Gaius Coelius Caldus, spent time across the Alps subduing remnants of the Cimbric invasion. The same year, the Social War broke out, and Sertorius contributed by levying soldiers and obtaining weapons. He may have done more, though the existing sources do not record it. According to the historian Sallust: 

His quaestorship may have been prorogued into 90 BC. Between 90–89 BC he almost certainly led as a commander and fought, along with providing men and materiel to the southern theatres of the war. He served under a series of commanders, probably Marius and Lucius Porcius Cato, most certainly under Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo. Sertorius fought in an &quot;especially bold&quot; manner during the war, and sustained a wound which cost him the use of one of his eyes.

Upon his return to Rome he apparently enjoyed the reputation of a war hero. Sertorius then ran for tribune of the Plebs in 89 or 88 BC, but Lucius Cornelius Sulla thwarted his efforts, causing Sertorius to oppose Sulla. Sulla&#x27;s reasons for doing so are unclear. It may have originated in a personal quarrel since both men served under Marius earlier in their careers. It is also equally possible Sulla (and by extension the optimates, who he was closely tied to through marriage with Caecilia Metella and opposition to Marius) were uncertain about what manner of tribune Sertorius would be, and not being able to rely on his obedience led to their opposition. Knowing Sertorius was popular with the common people and associated with Marius may have been enough to thwart his ambitions. In any case, Sertorius was a senator by 87 BC, likely adlected due to his earlier .

=== Sulla&#x27;s consulship and the &quot;bellum Octavianum&quot; ===
In 88 BC, after Publius Sulpicius Rufus and Marius supplanted his eastern command, Sulla marched his legions on Rome and took the capital. He took revenge on his enemies and forced Marius into exile, then left Italy to fight the First Mithridatic War against Mithridates VI of Pontus. Sulla did not harm Sertorius, probably because he had not participated in Marius and Rufus&#x27; actions. After Sulla left, violence erupted between Sullan loyalists, led by the consul Gnaeus Octavius, and the Marians, led by the consul Lucius Cornelius Cinna. Cinna, as &quot;the enemy of his enemy [Sulla]&quot; and &quot;not so much... an old ally of Marius as the newly emerging leader of those who disapproved of Sulla&#x27;s coup&quot; represented a re-emergence of Sertorius&#x27; political fortunes. As a result of this, and remembering Sulla&#x27;s opposition when he ran for tribune, Sertorius declared for the Marian faction. 

Cinna was driven from Rome in 87 BC during the Bellum Octavianum. Sertorius, as one of his allies, aided him in recruiting ex-legionaries and drumming up enough support to enable him to march on Rome. When Marius returned from exile in Africa to aid the Marian cause, Sertorius opposed granting him any command either out of fear his position would be diminished, or because he feared Marius&#x27; vindictiveness and what he would do when Rome was retaken. Sertorius advised not to trust Marius, and although he greatly disliked Marius by then, he consented to Marius&#x27; return given he came at Cinna&#x27;s request.

In October of 87 BC, Cinna marched on Rome. During the siege, Sertorius commanded one of Cinna&#x27;s divisions stationed at the Colline Gate and fought an inconclusive battle with troops commanded by Pompeius Strabo. Sertorius and Marius also bridged the Tiber to prevent supply from reaching the city by river. After Octavius surrendered Rome to the forces of Marius, Cinna, and Sertorius, Sertorius abstained from the proscriptions and killings his fellow commanders engaged in. Sertorius went so far as to rebuke Marius and move Cinna to moderation. After Marius&#x27; death he, probably with Cinna&#x27;s approval, annihilated Marius&#x27; slave army which was still terrorizing Rome.

=== Civil war against Sulla ===
The years 87–84 BC are often described as spent &quot;waiting for Sulla&quot; and what exactly Sertorius did while Cinna controlled Rome is unclear. He was not sent with Gaius Flavius Fimbria and Lucius Valerius Flaccus east for the First Mithridatic War. Sertorius certainly served in the government during this time; Cinna may have utilized his skill as a soldier and popularity with the people to quell any remnants of revolt and stabilize Italy, thereby consolidating his power and that of the Marian government. He probably also helped train and levy soldiers for Sulla&#x27;s inevitable return. Marius died in January 86 BC; eventually, Cinna himself was murdered in 84 BC, lynched by his own troops. It is probable that Sertorius became praetor in 85 or 84 BC.

On Sulla&#x27;s return from the East in 83 BC a civil war broke out. Sertorius, as a praetor, steadied the Marian leadership and was among the men chosen to command the anti-Sullan forces against him. When the consul Scipio Asiaticus marched against Sulla, Sertorius was part of his staff. Sulla arrived in Campania and found the other consul, Gaius Norbanus, blocking the road to Capua. At the Battle of Mount Tifata Sulla inflicted a crushing defeat on Norbanus, with Norbanus losing thousands of men. 

The beaten Norbanus withdrew with the remnants of his army to Capua. Sulla was stopped in his pursuit by Scipio&#x27;s advance. However, Scipio was unwilling to risk a battle and started negotiations under a flag of truce. Sulla&#x27;s motives in agreeing to the negotiations were not sincere, in that he likely agreed intending to make Scipio&#x27;s already disaffected army more likely to defect to him. Sertorius was present at the talks between the commanders, and advocated against letting Sulla&#x27;s troops fraternize with Scipio&#x27;s; he did not trust Sulla and advised Scipio to force a decisive action. Instead, he was sent to Norbanus to explain that an armistice was in force and negotiations were underway. 

Sertorius made a detour along his way and captured the town of Suessa Aurunca which had gone over to Sulla. Sertorius&#x27; motives for seizing Suessa are debated. He may have been simply re-establishing the status-quo, or he may have intentionally tried to force an end to negotiations. When Sulla complained to Scipio about this breach of trust by Sertorius, Scipio gave back his hostages as a sign of good faith. Disappointed by the behavior of their commander and unwilling to fight Sulla&#x27;s battle-hardened veterans, Scipio&#x27;s troops defected en masse. Scipio and his son were captured by Sulla, who released them after extracting a promise that they would never again fight against him or rejoin Cinna&#x27;s successor Carbo. 

After Suessa, Sertorius departed to Etruria where he raised yet another army, some 40 cohorts, as the Etruscans, having gained their Roman citizenship through the Marian regime, were fearful of a Sullan victory. In 82 BC, Marius&#x27; son, Gaius Marius the Younger, became consul without having held the offices that a candidate for the consulship should have held, and at the unconstitutional age of 27. Sertorius, who probably qualified for the office, objected but his opinion was ignored. Following this appointment, Sertorius returned to Rome and castigated the Marian leadership for their lack of action in combatting Sulla, pointed out Sulla&#x27;s bravery, and stated his belief that unless met directly soon Sulla would inevitably destroy them. Plutarch sums up the events:

==Governor of Hispania and fugitive==

By late 83 or early 82 BC, having fallen out with the new Marian leadership, Sertorius was sent to Hispania as proconsul, &quot;no doubt by mutual agreement&quot;. Sertorius may have been intended to go to Hispania even before Sulla&#x27;s Civil War in order to relieve command of the two Spanish provinces (Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior) from their governor, Gaius Valerius Flaccus, due to his doubtful loyalty to the Marian regime. 

When Sertorius marched through the Pyrenees mountain range he ran into severe weather and a mountain tribe that demanded a tribute for allowing his passage. His companions claimed it was an outrage; but Sertorius paid the tribe and commented that he was buying himself time, and that if a man had a lot to do, nothing is more precious than time. Flaccus, the governor of the two Spanish provinces, did not recognize his authority, but Sertorius had an army at his back and used it to assume control. He did not meet with significant resistance in his first seizure of Hispania. Sertorius persuaded the local chieftains to accept him as the new governor and endeared himself to the general population by cutting taxes, and then began to construct ships and levy soldiers in preparation for the armies he expected to be sent after him by Sulla. After gaining control of both provinces Sertorius sent an army, under Julius (possibly Livius) Salinator, to fortify the pass through the Pyrenees. 

During his occupation of Hispania Sertorius collected news of the war in Italy. Likely from refugees and Marian exiles fleeing Sulla&#x27;s veteran legions, by December of 82 BC he had heard of Sulla&#x27;s victory over the Marians in various battles, his second capture of Rome, and the Sullan proscriptions. Sertorius learned that he was one of the foremost among the proscribed, among the first names listed.By 81 BC all other significant Marian leaders were dead, and Sertorius&#x27; Spain had become a priority for the Sullan government. Sulla&#x27;s forces, probably three or four legions under the command of Gaius Annius Luscus, departed for Hispania early in 81 or very late in 82 BC, but were unable to break through the Pyrenees until Salinator was assassinated by P. Calpurnius Lanarius, one of his subordinates, who defected to the Sullans. Annius then marched into Hispania. 

=== Flight from Hispania to Tangier ===
Unable to convince the Spanish tribes to fight for him, Sertorius was seriously outnumbered and he abandoned his provinces. He fled to Nova Carthago and with 3,000 of his most loyal followers set sail to Mauritania, perhaps attempting some sort of attack on the coastal cities to keep his forces together, but was driven off by the locals. He then fell in with a band of Cilician pirates who were pillaging the Spanish coast. Together they attacked and took Pityussa, the most southerly of the Balearic Islands, which they started using as a base. When this was reported to Annius, he sent a fleet of warships and almost a full legion to drive Sertorius and his pirate allies from the Balearics. Sertorius engaged this superior fleet in a naval battle to avoid allowing them to disembark, but adverse winds broke most of his lighter ships, and he eventually fled the islands. 

Sertorius heard of, and had a genuine interest in the Isles of the Blessed, ascribing the isles to the Celto-Hispanian belief of an afterlife in the western ocean and learning more for his own political purposes. While he was idle Sertorius&#x27; pirate allies defected and went to Africa to help install the tyrant Ascalis on the throne of Tingis. Sertorius followed them to Africa in the fall of 81 or the spring of 80 BC, rallied the locals in the vicinity of Tingis, and defeated Ascalis&#x27; men and the pirates in battle. After gaining control over Tingis, Sertorius defeated and killed the general Vibius Paciaecus and his army, who was probably sent by Annius against him. Paciaecus&#x27; defeated army then joined Sertorius. 

Sertorius remained in Tangier for some time, and became involved with local customs. News of his success against Ascalis spread, and won Sertorius fame among the people of Hispania, particularly that of the Lusitanians in the west. The Lusitanians, being threatened by a Sullan governor again, asked Sertorius to be their war leader. 

It is likely they were influenced by Sertorius&#x27; tenure as governor being far gentler than his predecessors, who often extracted very high taxes and warred against tribes arbitrarily for glory and plunder, neither of which Sertorius had done. The Lusitanians were also implored by Sertorius&#x27; &quot;friends in Spain&quot;, likely Roman exiles who knew Sertorius, but were unable to flee with him when Annius retook Hispania and had consequently taken refuge in Lusitania. Sertorius did not lead the Lusitanians in a &#x27;war of liberation&#x27; from the Roman Republic however; instead, the Lusitanians, hoping for his milder administration to return, offered their support for him to revive the defeated Marian cause with Hispania as his base.

While considering the offer, Sertorius learned of his mother&#x27;s death in Italy and &quot;almost died of grief&quot;, lying in his tent, unable to speak for a week. With the aid of his companions, Sertorius eventually left his tent, accepted the Lusitanian offer, and prepared his army and fleet to return to Hispania.

==Sertorian War==

Sertorius crossed the strait at Gibraltar at Tingis in 80 BC, landing at Baelo near the Pillars of Hercules in the summer or fall of the year. A small fleet under an Aurelius Cotta (specific name not known) from the coastal town of Mellaria failed to stop him. After being reinforced by the Lusitanians he marched on Lucius Fufidius, propraetor of Hispania Ulterior, and defeated him at the Battle of the Baetis River, consolidating control over the province. News of Sertorius&#x27; victory spread throughout Hispania Ulterior, including a rumour that his army included fifty thousand cannibals.

=== Lusitania and Lacobriga ===
The Senate learned that Sertorius had returned to Hispania, and as a result sent Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, an experienced Sullan general, with a proconsular command by the Senate specifically to defeat and drive him from Hispania Ulterior. Metellus would be Sertorius&#x27; main antagonist between 80–77 BC. Prior to Metellus&#x27; arrival, Marcus Domitius Calvinus, proconsul in Hispania Citerior, marched against Sertorius but was defeated by Lucius Hirtuleius, Sertorius&#x27; legate. Sertorius, who referred to Metellus as &quot;the old woman&quot;, employed guerrilla warfare effectively and outmaneuvered Metellus through rapid and relentless campaigning. Sertorius also defeated and killed Lucius Thorius Balbus, Metellus&#x27; legate. 

Although initially outnumbered, Sertorius&#x27; repeated victories, along with his &quot;uncharacteristically humane&quot; administration impressed the native warriors, many of whom joined his cause. His character, in that he treated the natives as allies rather than subjects, may have also played a role. Sertorius organized the natives into an army and adjoined them to his core Roman forces, commanding them under Roman officers. The natives are said to have called Sertorius the &quot;new Hannibal&quot; whom he resembled physically (having one eye) and, they believed, in military skill. Although he was strict and severe with his soldiers, Sertorius was considerate to the natives, and made their burdens light despite financial strain in his war effort. This was likely partially pragmatic, as Sertorius had to retain the goodwill of the native Iberians if he had any chance of winning the war. Sertorius&#x27; most famous strategy to this end was his white fawn, a present from one of the natives that he claimed communicated to him the advice of the goddess Diana, who had been syncretized with a native Iberian deity.
The Iberians were greatly impressed by the fawn, who was calm in Sertorius&#x27; military camp and affectionate with him, and saw Sertorius as a divinely favoured leader. Sertorius would obscure information from military reports, claim Diana had told him of said information through the fawn in his dreams, and then act accordingly to further this belief. White animals were perceived as having oracular qualities among Germanic peoples, and in Hispania itself there existed a stag cult of funerary and oracular nature; this cult was most popular in western Hispania and Lusitania, where Sertorius drew his most fervent followers. As a result of all of these factors, Sertorius&#x27; power and army grew exponentially in 80 and 79 BC.
Sertorius successfully gained control over both Hispanian provinces with the aid of Hirtuleius in 79 BC despite Metellus&#x27; efforts. From 78 BC onward Metellus campaigned against Sertorian cities, but Sertorius thwarted his invasions into Lusitania and Ulterior. When Sertorius learned of Metellus&#x27; intention to siege Lacobriga, Sertorius supplied the city in response, and then prepared to meet Metellus there. When Metellus arrived and sent out foragers, Sertorius ambushed them and killed many, forcing Metellus to leave, unsuccessful. In 77 BC, Sertorius focused his attention on subduing Iberian tribes who had not yet accepted his authority in the interior. Metellus did not extensively campaign against Sertorius in the year due to the revolt in Rome of the consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (father of the triumvir). At some point during these years, Sertorius challenged Metellus to single combat, and when Metellus declined, his soldiers mocked him. Sertorius made the Iberians an organized army through Roman formations and signals. He encouraged them to decorate their armaments with precious metals, thus making them more likely to retain their equipment between engagements. Many native Iberians pledged themselves to him, serving as bodyguards who would take their own lives if he perished. 

Famously, while organizing his armies, the natives under Sertorius&#x27; command wanted to take on the Roman legions head-on. Unable to convince them otherwise, he allowed the natives to do so in a minor engagement. Afterward, he had two horses brought in front of them, one strong, the other weak. He ordered an old man to pull hairs from the strong horses&#x27; tail one by one, and a strong youth to pull on the weak horses&#x27; tail all at once; the old man completed his task, while the youth failed. Sertorius then explained that the Roman army was similar to the horse tail, in that it could be defeated if attacked piece by piece, but if taken all at once victory was impossible.

=== Contrebia and Lauron ===

In the summer of that year, with Lepidus&#x27; revolt having ended, the Roman Senate recognized a greater force was needed to defeat Sertorius, as to this point all Sullan generals had been defeated or killed and Metellus had proven to be no match for him. Both sitting consuls, however, refused to command the war against Sertorius. The Senate resorted to giving an extraordinary command to Pompey to crush Sertorius&#x27; rebellion. Soon after, probably in late 77 BC, Sertorius was joined by Marcus Perperna Veiento, with a following of Roman and Italian aristocrats and a sizeable Roman-style army of fifty-three cohorts. Although initially reluctant to place himself under Sertorius, Perperna was forced to do so by his own men. With this army Sertorius was able to meet the Roman commanders in open field engagements instead of only guerrilla warfare. 

Sertorius successfully sieged the native city of Contrebia in that year. Afterward, he called together representatives of the Iberian tribes, thanked them for their aid in providing arms for his troops, discussed the progress of the war and the advantages they would have if he was victorious, and then dismissed them.

By the 76 BC campaigning season, Pompey had recruited a large army, some 30,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry from his father and Sulla&#x27;s veterans, its size being evidence of the threat posed by Sertorius to the Sullan Senate. His arrival in Hispania stirred up rebellious sentiments against Sertorius in the peninsula, due to Pompey&#x27;s reputation as a skilled general. Sertorius paid close attention to Pompey&#x27;s movements despite his open contempt toward the younger general, who he called &quot;Sulla&#x27;s pupil&quot;. Sertorius was now at the height of his power, as near all of Iberia was under his control and he had several large armies throughout the peninsula with which to combat the Roman generals.

Sertorius, apparently, did not intend to march on Pompey or expect him to offer battle. He began the year with minor raids into the lands of the Berones and Autricones, presumably wanting to set a reliable headquarters in northern Hispania. When Pompey marched toward Valentia, Sertorius rapidly moved south and blockaded the strategic city of Lauron in Citerior, which had recently allied itself to Pompey. Sertorius besieged the city, likely hoping to pull Pompey from Valentia by attacking a new ally of his. 

In response, Pompey made for Lauron, and saw Sertorius encamped there already, beginning the Battle of Lauron. Sertorius remarked that he would give a lesson to Pompey: that a general must look behind him rather than in front of him. Sertorius outmaneuvered Pompey during the battle, forcing him to stay in place by threatening an attack from the rear, then killed his foragers and a Pompeian legion sent to relieve the foragers. When Pompey tried to form up his entire army to save his forces, Sertorius led out his own army. Knowing he would be outflanked if he gave battle, Pompey desisted, and a third of his army was slaughtered. Sertorius let the native Lauronians go and burned down the city. He then executed an entire Roman cohort due to their attempts to plunder and ravage the Lauronians after he gave orders that they were to be unharmed. 

==== The Sertorian Senate and school at Osca ====
Sertorius, in his efforts to build a stable powerbase in Hispania, is said to have established a Senate of three hundred members drawn from Roman emigrants in Iberia. He probably did not start calling it a Senate, nor did it contain a significant number of senators, until the arrival of Perperna and the Marian/Lepidan exiles in 77 BC. Whether the title of Senate was given to this body because it was a &quot;government in exile&quot; or innately due to the dignitas of its members is not known. It included many men, possibly one hundred or more, who were genuine senators but had fled Rome. Sertorius probably rose men of equestrian rank and other young nobles to his Senate to swell its numbers, and personally appointed proquaestors and propraetors; some men (such as Marcus Marius) apparently even advanced offices in his administration. How often Sertorius convened his Senate aside from the treaty he formed with Mithridates VI, and indeed whether he had the power to do so regularly, is uncertain. Though the quality of the Sertorian Senate deteriorated as Sertorius&#x27; war effort failed, the body was numerous and powerful enough, for a time, to challenge the authority of the Sullan Senate. 

For the children of the chief native families Sertorius provided a school at Osca, his capital city, where they received a Roman education and even adopted the dress and education of Roman youths; Sertorius held exams for the children, distributed prizes, and assured them and their fathers they would eventually hold some positions of power. This followed the Roman practice of taking hostages. Sertorius may have promised to grant these children, along with their families, Roman citizenship.

=== Sucro and Saguntum ===
In 75 BC, Perperna and Herennius were defeated at the Battle of Valentia by Pompey. Hearing this, Sertorius left the command against Metellus with Hirtuleius and marched his army to meet Pompey. Metellus defeated Hirtuleius at the Battle of Italica, so Sertorius sent Perperna at the head of a large army to block Metellus from coming to Pompey&#x27;s aid and engaged Pompey, who, for whatever reason, chose to accept the offer of battle rather than wait for his ally, beginning the Battle of Sucro late in the day.

Each general took the right flank; Pompey faced a Sertorian legate, while Sertorius faced Lucius Afranius. When Sertorius saw his left wing falling to Pompey, he rallied them and led a counterattack which shattered the Pompeian right, nearly capturing Pompey himself. Afranius, however, had broken the Sertorian right and was plundering their camp; Sertorius rode over and forced Afranius to depart back to Pompey. Both armies drew up again the next day, but Sertorius then heard Metellus had defeated Perperna and was now marching to aid Pompey. Unwilling to fight two armies who would outnumber him if joined, Sertorius decamped, bitterly commenting:

 Sertorius negotiated with King Mithridates VI of Pontus during his war, likely in the winter of 75 BC. Mithridates wanted Roman confirmation of his occupation of the Roman Province of Asia, after relinquishing control of it to Sulla in the First Mithridatic War, along with the Kingdoms of Bithynia and Cappadocia. Sertorius assembled his Senate to discuss the issue, and decided that Mithridates could get Bithynia and Cappadocia (and possibly Paphlaglonia and Galatia as well) as they were kingdoms that &quot;had nothing to do with the Romans&quot;. But Asia, being a Roman province, would not be allowed to be his again. Mithridates accepted these terms and sent 3,000 talents of gold and forty ships to Hispania; in return, Sertorius sent the general Marcus Marius and other soldiers to Pontus. 

Sertorius was eventually forced by his native troops to give battle against Metellus and Pompey, likely when Metellus marched on the Celtiberian town of Segontia. The coming Battle of Saguntum was the last pitched battle Sertorius fought, the largest battle of the war, and probably one he had not wanted in the first place. The fighting lasted from noon until night-time and resulted in the deaths of Gaius Memmius and Hirtuleius. Though Sertorius defeated Pompey on the wing, Metellus again defeated Perperna. The battle ultimately ended in a draw, with heavy losses for both sides. 

Following the battle Sertorius disbanded his army, telling them to break up and reassemble at a later location rather than organizing a concerted retreat, for fear of Metellus&#x27; pursuit. This was common for Sertorius, who &quot;wandered about alone, and often took field again with an army... like a winter torrent, suddenly swollen&quot;.

=== Clunia and the final years ===
After the battle Sertorius reverted to guerrilla warfare, having lost the heavy infantry Perperna had lent to his cause which enabled him to match the Sullan legions in the field. He retired to a strong fortress town in the mountains called Clunia. Pompey and Metellus rushed to besiege him, and during the siege, Sertorius made many sallies against them, inflicting heavy casualties. Sertorius convinced Metellus and Pompey that he intended to remain besieged, and eventually broke through their lines, rejoined with a fresh Sertorian army, and resumed the war. 

The two Roman generals had pursued Sertorius into unfriendly lands and thus Sertorius regained the initiative. For the rest of the year he resumed a guerrilla campaign against them, eventually forcing Metellus and Pompey to winter out of Sertorian-aligned land due to lack of resources. During that winter, Pompey wrote to the Senate for reinforcements and funds, without which, he said, he and Metellus would be driven from Hispania. Despite being weakened, Sertorius was still perceived as a threat, as in Rome it was apparently said that he would return to Italy before Pompey did. The Senate capitulated to Pompey&#x27;s demands; funds and men (two legions) were found with effort and sent to the Roman generals. 

With the men and materiel reinforcements from Pompey&#x27;s letter, in 74–73 BC, Pompey and Metellus gained the upper hand. The two Roman generals began slowly grinding down Sertorius&#x27; rebellion via attritional warfare. Sertorius lacked the men to meet them in open combat, though he continued to harry them with guerrilla warfare. Mass defections to the Roman generals began, and Sertorius responded to this with harshness and punishments. Sertorius continued to win some victories, but it was by now clear he could not achieve complete victory. The Roman generals continued to occupy strongholds that were once under his control, and Sertorius&#x27; support among the Iberian tribes faltered as discontent among his Roman staff rose.

Sertorius was in league with the Cilician Pirates, who had bases and fleets all around the Mediterranean. Near the end of his war he was also in communication with the insurgent slaves of Spartacus in Italy, who were openly in revolt against Rome. But due to jealousies and fears among his high-ranking Roman officers a conspiracy was beginning to take form.

==Conspiracy and death==
Metellus, seeing that the key to victory was removing Sertorius, had made his pitch toward the Romans still with Sertorius sometime between 79 and 74 BC, likely later rather than earlier: &quot;Should any Roman kill Sertorius he would be given a hundred talents of silver and twenty-thousand &quot;iugera&quot; of land. If he was an exile he would be free to return to Rome&quot;. This &quot;exorbitant&quot; proposed payment for Sertorius&#x27; assassination equated to about fifty times the sum granted for the murder of a regular proscribed Roman. Metellus&#x27; proclamation eventually turned Sertorius paranoid, and he started distrusting his Roman retinue, including his Roman bodyguard, which he exchanged for an Iberian one. This was deeply unpopular among his Roman followers. 

From late 74 BC onward, sources report that the once mild and just Sertorius had become paranoid, irritable, and cruel to his subordinates, descending into alcoholism and debauchery. Plutarch writes that &quot;as his cause grew hopeless, he became harsh toward those who did him wrong&quot;. It is generally agreed that Sertorius became cruel in his later years. Konrad, for example, argues that the accounts of Sertorius&#x27; tyranny &quot;fit the pattern of the charismatic leader forsaken by good luck&quot;, and that many factors support the idea. A few scholars disagree, however; Spann writes that claims of Sertorius&#x27; tyranny may be exaggerated or wholly false (driven by bias in ancient sources), while Bennett believes that unconsidered repetition of said claims is &quot;bad history&quot;. 

By 73 BC, the Roman aristocrats who comprised the higher classes of his domain were discontent with Sertorius. They had grown jealous of his power, and could now see that victory was growing impossible. Sertorius&#x27; return to guerrilla warfare in 74 BC had worsened this jealousy by placing the Iberians in his retinue in more prominent positions than his Roman staff. Perperna, aspiring to take Sertorius&#x27; place and perhaps resentful from serving as the subordinate of a &quot;new man&quot; like Sertorius for so long, encouraged the discontent of Sertorius&#x27; top Roman staff for his own ends, leading the conspiracy against him. The conspirators began oppressing the local Iberian tribes in Sertorius&#x27; name. This stirred discontent and revolt in the tribes, resulting in a cycle of oppression, with Sertorius uncertain as to the cause. Sertorius executed and sold many of the Oscan schoolchildren into slavery as a result of these native revolts. 

=== Assassination ===
Perperna chose to assassinate Sertorius due to his belief that Sertorius may learn of his conspiracy from the other members. Perperna told Sertorius of a supposed victory over the Roman generals and suggested a banquet. Perperna, with effort, persuaded Sertorius to attend to separate him from his bodyguards. 

The banquet took place at Osca, Sertorius&#x27; capital, sometime in 73 or 72 BC. The conspirators included many of Sertorius&#x27; top staff, such as Marcus Antonius, Lucius Fabius Hispaniensis, Gaius Octavius Graecinus, Gaius Tarquitius Priscus (all proscribed senators), Aufidius, Manlius, and Perperna himself. Sertorius&#x27; scribes, Versius and Maecenas, may have been involved since they were in perfect positions to forge evidence of Perperna&#x27;s supposed victory. Sertorius&#x27; loyal Spanish bodyguards were made drunk and kept outside of the banquet hall. 

Although Appian&#x27;s description of Sertorius&#x27; debauchery may be exaggerated, some sources believe Sertorius was drunk at the banquet. Plutarch reports that any festivities Sertorius was invited to were apparently very proper, but this banquet was purposely indecent, &quot;with the hope of angering Sertorius&quot;. Why the assassins wanted to goad Sertorius is unclear, given an agitated man would be harder to kill than an unsuspecting one. Sertorius, either out of disgust or due to his inebriation, threw himself back on the couch he was resting on. Perperna then gave the signal to the conspirators by dropping his goblet on the floor, and they attacked. Antonius slashed at Sertorius, but he turned away from the blow and would have risen if Antonius did not hold him down. The others stabbed him until he was dead.

== Aftermath ==
Sertorius&#x27; personal prestige and charisma sustained much of the support for his revolt. Upon learning of Sertorius&#x27; death, some of his Iberian allies sent ambassadors to Pompey or Metellus and made peace. Most simply went home. Iberian support for the Sertorian cause deteriorated rapidly after Sertorius&#x27; death: the Lusitanians in particular (who were among Sertorius&#x27; greatest partisans) were infuriated by his assassination. What happened to Sertorius&#x27; white doe and his body is not known. 

=== Perperna&#x27;s command ===
Perperna assumed control of the dwindling rebel army after Sertorius&#x27; assassination. He was only able to avoid violence from the soldiers and natives by giving gifts, releasing prisoners and hostages, and by executing several leading Sertorians, including his own nephew. 

Sertorius&#x27; will named Perperna his chief beneficiary. Already disliked due to assassinating his commander (the man who had given him sanctuary), Perperna was now also revealed to have killed his main benefactor and friend. Sertorius&#x27; death also led many to remember his virtues, and not his recent despotism.

=== End of the Sertorian War ===
After Sertorius&#x27; death his independent &quot;Roman&quot; Republic crumbled with the renewed onslaught of Pompey and Metellus. Metellus, who &quot;considered it no longer a difficult task for Pompey alone to vanquish Perpenna&quot; left for other parts of Hispania. Pompey subsequently eliminated Perperna&#x27;s army and killed the rest of Sertorius&#x27; assassins and top Roman staff due to their proscribed status. Some fled to Africa and may have entered the service of the mercenary Publius Sittius. The only known survivor, Aufidius, &quot;came to old age in a barbarian village, a poor and hated man&quot;. Other Sertorian officers and soldiers (who were not proscribed, only &quot;hostes publici&quot;, or &#x27;public enemies&#x27;) were well treated by Pompey once they surrendered. 

Several Sertorian cities refused to surrender after the assassination of Sertorius, and Pompey remained in Hispania for some years pacifying these remaining holdouts. Most famously, the city of Calagurris resorted to cannibalism rather than submitting to the Roman siege, but was eventually taken by forces under Lucius Afranius. The two victorious generals, each desiring a triumph, wanted the war to be considered foreign rather than civil. When Pompey crossed the Pyrenees to return to Rome in 71 BC, he erected a monument to his victory speaking of the more than eight hundred towns he subjugated. The monument lacked any mention of Sertorius. 

During Gaius Julius Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars, when his lieutenant Publius Licinius Crassus was conquering Aquitania in 56 BC, the Gauls sent ambassadors to many surrounding tribes for help, including Iberians from Hispania Citerior. These Iberians were led by veterans who had fought with Sertorius during his war and had learned Roman military tactics from him; they showed &quot;disconcerting proficiency in fighting Romans&quot;, and in the words of Caesar, &quot;were supposed to have very great skill in military matters&quot;. These veterans picked prime positions for camps, conducted raids on supply lines, and did not overextend themselves. Crassus eventually defeated these Sertorian veterans.

== Legacy ==

=== Generalship and character ===
Ancient sources generally concede Sertorius was a great military leader (&quot;magnus dux&quot;), and note his proficiency in warfare. Appian (who was hostile to Sertorius) states his belief that despite his apparent descent into debauchery and paranoia, &quot;if Sertorius had lived longer the war would not have ended so soon or so easily&quot;. 

Modern sources believe that Sertorius was &quot;one of the greatest tacticians antiquity ever produced&quot;. Frontinus recorded many of Sertorius&#x27; military tactics in his Stratagemata, with only a few Roman generals exceeding him. Konrad notes that Sertorius proving &quot;an instant master of the art&quot; of guerrilla warfare is remarkable, given he was a Roman and probably did not train the skill. Spann, more analytically, criticizes Sertorius&#x27; cautious strategy during the war, which led to his eventual defeat by Pompey. 

During the Sullan Proscriptions, Sertorius was &quot;especially feared&quot; and his war was not seen as a foregone conclusion while it was occurring. Some modern sources believe Sertorius was a traitor to Rome for his war against the Sullan Senate, cooperation with native Iberians against Roman armies, and alliance with Mithridates; others believe he was a true patriot of a defeated regime. While some ancient historians scorn Sertorius&#x27; cruelty and the &quot;savage and prodigal&quot; man he is said to have become late in his war, others admire his &quot;great, but ill-starred, valour&quot;. Livy appears to have viewed Sertorius not as &quot;an Iberianized robber baron&quot; but &quot;a great Roman whose life went all wrong&quot;. Similarly, Konrad believes Plutarch conceived the &quot;Life of Sertorius&quot; as the character study of &quot;a gifted yet imperfect man struggling against an unkind fate, to no avail&quot;. 

No busts or coinage depicting Sertorius have survived. Despite Valerius Maximus reporting the presence of a wife in Italy, there is no evidence of Sertorius having had any children. 

Many commentators described Sertorius&#x27; life as a tragedy. Plutarch wrote that &quot;He [Sertorius] was more continent than Philip, more faithful to his friends than Antigonus, and more merciful to his enemies than Hannibal; and that for prudence and judgment he gave place to none of them, but in fortune was inferior to them all&quot;. Gruen writes that &quot;only the divisive contests of civil war forced him to end his life as a declared outlaw rather than an esteemed senator&quot;. Spann concluded, &quot;Sertorius&#x27; talents were wasted, his life lost, in an inglorious struggle he did not want, could not win, and could not escape&quot;. 
=== Impact on Pompey ===
Modern accounts that do not directly deal with Sertorius largely describe him and his war in terms of its impact on the Roman state, and his influence on the career of Pompey the Great. Leach calls Sertorius one of Pompey&#x27;s &quot;most brilliant adversaries&quot;, and Collins refers to him as an &quot;eccentric genius of guerrilla warfare&quot;. Goldsworthy notes that Sertorius taught Pompey several &quot;sharp lessons&quot;; Pompey himself, in his letter to the Senate preserved by Sallust, purportedly wrote (describing the events of 76 BC) of how he weathered the first attack of the &quot;triumphant Sertorius&quot; and &quot;spent the winter in camp amid the most savage of foes&quot;.

Pompey&#x27;s highly irregular career was initiated by the aftermath of the civil wars of Sulla and Marius, but it was the strong military threat Sertorius posed which necessitated his extraordinary, illegal, effectively proconsular command and thereby deteriorated the Senate&#x27;s control over the Roman army. Catherine Steel notes that Pompey&#x27;s defeat of Sertorius, which solidified Pompey&#x27;s extraordinary position in the state, &quot;created its own set of problems&quot;. Spann agrees, suggesting that Sertorius&#x27; central legacy was that his revolt &quot;decisively transformed &#x27;Sulla&#x27;s Pupil&#x27; into Pompeius &quot;Magnus&quot;&quot;, whose prominence was to play a role in influencing yet further civil wars.

=== Political legacy and motives ===
Sertorius&#x27; motives cannot really be known, though evidence suggests he saw himself fighting for the survival and re-enfranchisement of those disinherited and proscribed after Sulla&#x27;s victory in 82 BC (including himself, who, like the rest, had no prospects in Sulla&#x27;s republic). Plutarch reports that Sertorius himself repeatedly sought terms with Metellus and Pompey to return to Rome (after a victory in the field), telling them he would rather &quot;live in Rome as her meanest citizen rather than to live in exile from his country and be called supreme ruler of all the rest of the world together&quot;. Katz believes this wish for a negotiated settlement may, in part, explain Sertorius&#x27; cautious strategy throughout his war.

To the proscribed, Sertorius represented a chance for re-emergence in Roman politics, and a return to their properties and lives in Rome. Sertorius&#x27; war is, resultantly, seen as &quot;an inheritance from the Sullan proscription&quot;, and its end, along with his death, signalled the close of the civil wars started by Sulla&#x27;s First March on Rome. None of the proscribed, including those who fought with Sertorius, are known to have received a pardon. Ironically, the defeat of Sertorius (and thus the last Marian resistance) may have caused the repealing of several of Sulla&#x27;s laws, as there was no longer &quot;fear that the [Sullan] structure itself might crumble&quot;. According to Steel, Sertorius&#x27; seizure of Hispania was &quot;highly significant&quot; as a display, similar to Sulla in his civil war, of how Roman foreign policy in the late second century relied greatly on domestic affairs.

Spann believes that &quot;Sertorius, if successful in Spain, clearly meant to invade Italy. He would not have set up some sort of independent state in Spain&quot;, and so Gruen, &quot;Sertorius&#x27; target was the government in Rome... of his political enemies. Had he been victorious, there would have been a change in leadership, not in social or political system&quot;. Spann and Konrad view Sertorius&#x27; success in a march on Rome as unlikely; however, Konrad believes existing discontent within the Sullan government &quot;might have provided him [Sertorius] with enough support to mount a serious challenge to the regime once he crossed the Alps&quot;.

<text>Iffley is a village in a designated conservation area in Oxfordshire, England. It lies within the boundaries of the city of Oxford, between Cowley and the estates of Rose Hill and Donnington, and in proximity to the River Thames (Isis). A notable feature is its largely unchanged Norman church, St Mary the Virgin, which has a modern stained glass Nativity window designed by John Piper and another window designed by Roger Wagner. The church is a Grade I listed building.

==History==

The ending of the name of this village near Oxford, means &quot;cleared ground&quot;: the Old English term for that was &quot;ley&quot; — just up the road from modern Iffley, the town of Cowley also preserves the Old English ending and meaning in its name. No records of the foundation of Iffley have been found, but the reason for its founding is clear from the location: Iffley has a little hill, and so is the first place downriver from Oxford from which traffic on the Thames might be surveyed, and controlled — and where people might be safe from floods:

During the 12th century Oxford townsmen built a watermill at Iffley, which was bought by Lincoln College, Oxford in 1445: the mill burned in 1908, having survived for nearly 800 years. Products ground at the Iffley mill included malt, barley, corn and other cereals — for a brief time during the 15th century it was a fulling mill. The mill,

In 1156 Iffley was among the holdings of the Norman family of St. Remy, until about 1200. They established Iffley as a parish, and built the parish church, &quot;in size and decorative splendour out of all proportion to the place&quot;. The manor was owned by many, thereafter. The Archdeacons of Oxford were given the right to appoint the parish priest in 1279: they held this until 1965, when the power was given to the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church, Oxford.

In 1921 the civil parish had a population of 405. On 1 April 1929 the parish was abolished and merged with St Giles and St John and Littlemore.

==Domesday Book entry==
==Iffley Meadows==
Iffley Meadows is a nature reserve occupying much of Iffley Island, an area of flood-meadow on the opposite side of the Thames. The reserve is managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust on behalf of Oxford City Council. The meadows are notable for their large population of snake&#x27;s head fritillaries.

<doc id="160719" wikidata="Q7553142" url="?curid=160719" title="Sod's law">
<text>Sod&#x27;s law, a British culture axiom, states that &quot;if something &quot;can&quot; go wrong, it will&quot;. The law sometimes has a corollary: that the misfortune will happen at &quot;the worst possible time&quot; (Finagle&#x27;s law). The term is commonly used in the United Kingdom (while in many parts of North America the phrase &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law&quot; is more popular).

The phrase seems to derive, at least in part, from the colloquialism an &quot;unlucky &quot;; a term for someone who has had some bad (unlucky) experience, and is usually used as a sympathetic reference to the person.

A slightly different form of Sod&#x27;s law states that &quot;the degree of failure is in direct proportion to the effort expended and to the need for success.&quot;

An alternative expression, again in British culture, is &quot;hope for the best, expect the worst&quot;.

== Comparison with Murphy&#x27;s law ==
Sod&#x27;s law is a more extreme version of Murphy&#x27;s law. While Murphy&#x27;s law says that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong (eventually), Sod&#x27;s law requires that it will &quot;always&quot; go wrong with the worst possible outcome or at the worst time. Belief in Sod&#x27;s law can be viewed as a combination of the law of truly large numbers and the psychological effect of the law of selection. The former says we should expect things to go wrong now and then, and the latter says the exceptional events where something went wrong stand out in memory, but the great number of mundane events where nothing exceptional happened fall into obscurity. Sod’s law is also explained as a form of the natural human negativity bias, the survival trait of being extra alert to negative events.

== Examples ==

Some examples are traffic lights turning red when a driver is in a hurry, or email software crashing at the exact moment the user attempts to send an important message. Sod&#x27;s law has also been applied to individuals, such as the composer Beethoven losing his hearing or Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen losing an arm in a car crash.

Other examples are dropped bread always landing butter side down, or it raining just after one has washed the car and on the weekend one goes to the beach.

A discrediting example is a coin toss resulting in tails the more strongly that one wishes the result to be heads. Richard Dawkins said that this shows the idea of Sod&#x27;s law is &quot;nonsense&quot;, as the coin is unaware of the person&#x27;s wish and has no desire to thwart it.

<text>João de Barros (; 1496 – 20 October 1570), nicknamed the &quot;Portuguese Livy&quot;, is one of the first great Portuguese historians, most famous for his (&quot;Decades of Asia&quot;), a history of the Portuguese in India, Asia, and southeast Africa.

==Early years==
João de Barros was born in Viseu, Portugal around 1496. He was the illegitimate son of Lopo de Barros, a squire in the royal household of Manuel I of Portugal and a holder of various judicial posts. Nothing is known of his mother. At a young age his father died and he was placed into service at the royal household, where he became a page to the heir apparent, Dom João, the future João III of Portugal.

Educated in the palace, he composed, at the age of twenty, a romance of chivalry, the &quot;Chronicle of the Emperor Clarimundo&quot;, in which he is said to have had the assistance of Prince John (later King John III). 

Upon ascending the throne, King John III awarded Barros the captaincy of the fortress of St George of Elmina, to which he proceeded in 1524. In 1525, he obtained the post of treasurer of the India House, which he held until 1528.

To escape from an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1530 Barros moved from Lisbon to his country house near Pombal, where he finished a moral dialogue, &quot;Rho pica Pneuma&quot;, which was praised by Juan Luís Vives. On his return to Lisbon in 1532 the king appointed Barros factor of the &quot;Casa da Índia e da Mina&quot; (House of India and Mina)— a position of great responsibility and importance at a time when Lisbon was the European center for the trade of the East. Barros proved a good administrator, displaying great industry and an honesty rare at the time, with the result that he made little profit compared to his predecessors, who had amassed fortunes.

==The failed captaincy in Brazil and shipwreck==

In 1534, João III introduced an initiative to encourage the colonization of Brazil. A dozen hereditary captaincies were established along the coast and placed under the governorship of &quot;donatários&quot; or lord-proprietors. Barros was one of the first to be granted a captaincy at Maranhão. He formed a partnership with two merchants, Aries da Cunha and Alvares de Andrade, and sent an expedition consisting of ten vessels and 900 men to Brazil.

Owing to the ignorance of the pilots, the whole fleet was shipwrecked, which entailed serious financial loss to Barros. As a gesture of goodwill, Barros subsequently paid the debts of those who had perished in the expedition.

During these years he had continued his studies in his leisure hours, and shortly after the Brazilian disaster he offered to write a history of the Portuguese in India, the &quot;Décadas da Ásia&quot;, which the king accepted. He began work forthwith, but, before printing the first part, he published a Portuguese grammar (1539) and some further moral Dialogues. His 1543 text &quot;Diálogo evangélico sobre os artigos da fé contra o Talmud dos Judeus&quot; makes anti-Jewish remarks.

==&quot;Decades of Asia&quot;==

The first of the &quot;Décadas da Ásia&quot; (&quot;Decades of Asia&quot;) appeared in 1552, and its reception was such that the king straightway charged Barros to write a chronicle of King Manuel. His many occupations, however, prevented him from undertaking this book, which was finally composed by Damião de Góis. The second &quot;Decade&quot; came out in 1553 and the third in 1563, but he died before publishing the fourth &quot;Decade&quot;. The latter was published posthumously in 1615 at Madrid by the Cosmographer and Chronicler-Royal Joao Baptista Lavanha, who edited and compiled Barros&#x27; scattered manuscript.

His &quot;Decades&quot; contain the early history of the Portuguese in India and Asia and reveal careful study of Eastern historians and geographers, as well as of the records of his own country. They are distinguished by clearness of exposition and orderly arrangement. They are also lively accounts, for example describing the king of Viantana&#x27;s killing of the Portuguese ambassadors to Malacca with boiling water and then throwing their bodies to the dogs.

Diogo de Couto continued the &quot;Décadas&quot;, adding nine more, and a modern edition of the whole appeared in Lisbon in 14 vols. in 1778—1788 as &quot;Da Asia de João de Barros, dos feitos que os Portuguezes fizeram no descubrimento e conquista dos mares e terras do Oriente&quot;. The edition is accompanied by a volume containing a life of Barros by the historian Manuel Severim de Faria and a copious index of all the &quot;Decades&quot;.

==Later years==
In January 1568 Barros retired from his remunerative appointment at the India House, receiving the rank of &quot;fidalgo&quot; together with a pension and other pecuniary emoluments from King Sebastian, and died on 20 October 1570.

<doc id="160725" wikidata="Q316518" url="?curid=160725" title="Louis-Gabriel Suchet">
<text>Louis-Gabriel Suchet, duc d&#x27;[[Albufera de València|Albuféra]] (; 2 March 1770 – 3 January 1826), was a French Marshal of the Empire and one of the most successful commanders of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He is regarded as one of the greatest generals of the Napoleonic Wars.
==Early life==
Suchet was born on 2 March 1770 in Lyon, the son of Jean-Pierre Suchet and Anne-Marie Jacquier. His mother died four years later. His father was a silk merchant, and Suchet originally intended to follow a business career. He received a solid education and joined his father&#x27;s business in 1787, working as an apprentice for two years.

Upon Jean-Pierre&#x27;s death in January 1789, Suchet and his brother Gabriel-Catherine took over the family enterprise, which they decided to expand under the name &quot;Maison Suchet frères&quot;. However, the French Revolution led Suchet to volunteer, in 1791, for the cavalry of the National Guard at Lyon. He displayed abilities which secured rapid military promotions, and by 1792 he was a captain of the volunteers from Ardèche.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
After the &quot;Levée en masse&quot; of August 1793, Suchet was appointed commander of the 4th Ardèche Battalion. In this capacity he served in the Siege of Toulon, where he captured British General Charles O&#x27;Hara. In May 1794, at the head of 250 soldiers of his battalion, he suppressed a counter-revolutionary uprising in the town of Bédoin in southeastern France. Suchet was then sent to the Army of Italy, where he would serve for most of the next seven years. He fought at the Battle of Loano in November 1795 during the army&#x27;s first campaign. During the Italian campaign of 1796–1797, he served with distinction at the battles of Lodi, Castiglione, and Bassano. He went to Paris on leave after being severely wounded on 11 October at Cerea, but soon returned to the army.

In May 1797, Suchet was one of three lieutenant colonels of the 18th Infantry Demi-brigade, with little hope of advancement. He was sent to Venice to procure uniforms for the troops. Since the Venetians believed that they might in future be ruled by the French, Suchet and an aide were treated like royalty. For two months, they enjoyed living in a palace, having a personal gondola and holding reserved seats at the opera. On 28 October 1797, 150 officers of André Masséna&#x27;s division hosted a large dinner. The colonel of the 32nd Line, Dominique Martin Dupuy brought Suchet to Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s table and said, &quot;Well general, when will you make our friend Suchet a colonel?&quot; Bonaparte tried to brush him off with the reply, &quot;Soon: we will see about it.&quot; Thereupon Dupuy took off one of his epaulettes and placed it on Suchet&#x27;s shoulder, saying, &quot;By my almightiness, I make thee colonel.&quot; This clownish action was successful; Bonaparte immediately directed Louis-Alexandre Berthier to write out Suchet&#x27;s nomination for advancement. 

Suchet received the command of the 18th half-brigade (&quot;) on 26 October 1797. In March 1798, he served under General Guillaume Brune in the invasion of Switzerland. At the end of the campaign, he was promoted to brigade general and was given the honor of presenting the flags captured from the enemy to the Directory. Although designated to take part in the expedition to Egypt, Brune kept Suchet’s services and appointed him his chief of staff in the Army of Italy, a role that he retained under General Barthélemy Joubert, Brune&#x27;s successor as commander in Italy and Suchet&#x27;s friend. He was appointed chief of staff of the Army of the Danube on 21 February 1799, but soon rejoined Joubert in Italy and was promoted to general of division. After Joubert&#x27;s death at the Battle of Novi, Suchet continued to serve as chief of staff to his successors Moreau and Championnet.

In 1800, Suchet was named second-in-command to General André Masséna. His dexterous resistance to the superior forces of the Austrians with the left wing of Masséna&#x27;s army, when the right and centre were besieged in Genoa, not only prevented the invasion of France from this direction but contributed to the success of Bonaparte&#x27;s crossing of the Alps, leading to a decisive victory at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June. Following the signing of the Convention of Alessandria on 15 June, Suchet was entrusted with the administration of Genoa and Lucca. He took a prominent part in the subsequent of the Italian campaign up to the Armistice of Treviso, and thereafter served as governor of Padua until the Peace of Lunéville and the end of the War of the Second Coalition. He was appointed Inspector-General of the Infantry on 24 July 1801.

==Napoleonic Wars==

Suchet greatly enhanced his reputation during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1804, during the War of the Third Coalition, he commanded the 4th division of Marshal Lannes&#x27;s IV Corps and distinguished himself at the battles of Ulm and Austerlitz. He served under Lannes in the V Corps in 1806, during the War of the Fourth Coalition, and fought at the battles of Saalfeld, Jena, Pułtusk, and Ostrolenka. 

In the subsequent negotiations of the Treaties of Tilsit, Suchet worked with Russian generals Tolstoy and Wittgenstein on the settlement of the borders of the new Duchy of Warsaw. He was named a Count of the Empire on 24 June 1808. Two months later, Suchet was stationed to Silesia as commander-in-chief of the V Corps.

===Peninsular War===

Suchet was deployed to Spain in November 1808. After serving in the Siege of Zaragoza, in April 1809 he was appointed commander of the Army of Aragon and governor of that region. Within two years, he brought the area into complete submission by wise and skillful administration no less than by his valor. Beaten by the Spanish at the Battle of Alcañiz, he defeated the army of Blake y Joyes at the Battle of María on 14 June 1809. On 22 April 1810, he defeated O&#x27;Donnell at the Siege of Lérida, then laid siege to Mequinenza in May. 

He captured Tortosa on 2 January 1811. For his successful Siege of Tarragona from May to June 1811, Suchet was made a Marshal of the Empire by Napoleon on 8 July 1811. He then launched an invasion of the region of Valencia, defeated Blake y Joyes at the Battle of Saguntum on 15 October, and received the capitulation of Valencia on 9 January 1812. He was rewarded with the title of &quot; (Duke of Albuféra) on 24 January 1812.

After the tide turned against France, Suchet managed to defend his territories in eastern Spain until the French defeat at Vitoria on 21 June 1813, after which he was forced to evacuate Valencia. He withdrew to Catalonia then to the Pyrenees before finally re-entering France, and afterwards took part in the defense of southwestern France until Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in April 1814.

==Hundred Days and later life==
Suchet accepted the Bourbon Restoration and was made a peer of France on 4 June 1814 by King Louis XVIII. This was forfeited (effective 24 July 1815) by his support of Napoleon&#x27;s return during the Hundred Days. During Napoleon&#x27;s brief restoration, Suchet was given command of the Army of the Alps and led the defensive campaign on the southeastern front. He resisted the Allies&#x27; advance for nearly two months before withdrawing to his hometown of Lyon, where he signed an armistice on 12 July.

Suchet was only restored to the Chamber of Peers on 5 March 1819. Unlike other marshals whom Napoleon harshly criticized in Saint Helena, Suchet never lost Napoleon&#x27;s high esteem. He died on 3 January 1826 at the Château de Saint-Joseph-Montredon, now called Château de Saint-Just, near Marseille. His son, Louis-Napoléon (1813–1877), succeeded him as Duc d&#x27;Albufera.

==Legacy==

His memoirs (&quot;&quot;) were published in two volumes from 1829 to 1834.

The chicken dish &quot;poularde à la d&#x27;Albuféra&quot; is named after him.

==Family==
Suchet married Honorine Anthoine de Saint-Joseph (Marseille, 26 February 1790– Paris, 13 April 1884), a niece of Julie Clary, the wife of Joseph Bonaparte, on 16 November 1808. They had three children:
* Louise-Honorine (1811 – 1885)
* Louis-Napoléon (1813 – 1877)
* [daughter, unknown name] (1820 – 1835)

<text>George Town is the capital of the Malaysian state of Penang. It is the core city of the George Town Conurbation, Malaysia&#x27;s second largest metropolitan area with a population of 2.84 million and the second largest metropolitan economy in the country. The city proper spans an area of encompassing Penang Island and surrounding islets, and had a population of 794,313 .

Classified as a &quot;Gamma −&quot; city, the second highest in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur, George Town is the commercial centre for northern Malaysia and one of the few high-income economies of the cities outside the Klang Valley. According to Euromonitor International and the Economist Intelligence Unit, George Town has the highest potential for revenue growth among all Malaysian cities and contributed nearly 8 per cent of the country&#x27;s personal disposable income in 2015, second only to Kuala Lumpur. Its technological sector, anchored by hundreds of multinational companies, has made George Town the top exporter in the country. The Penang International Airport links George Town to several regional cities, while a ferry service and two road bridges connect the city to the rest of Peninsular Malaysia. Swettenham Pier is the busiest cruise terminal in the country.

Established as an entrepôt by Francis Light in 1786, George Town was the first British settlement in Southeast Asia, and its proximity to maritime routes along the Strait of Malacca attracted an influx of immigrants from various parts of Asia. It became the capital of the Straits Settlements in 1826, only to lose its administrative status to Singapore in 1832. Shortly before Malaya attained independence from Britain in 1957, George Town was declared a city by Queen Elizabeth II, making it the first city in the country&#x27;s history. In 1974, George Town was merged with the rest of the island, throwing its city status into doubt until 2015, when its jurisdiction was reinstated and expanded to cover the entire island and adjacent islets.

The city is described by UNESCO as having a &quot;unique architectural and cultural townscape&quot; that is shaped by centuries of intermingling between various cultures and religions. It has also gained a reputation as Malaysia&#x27;s gastronomical capital for its distinct culinary scene. The preservation of these cultures contributed to the designation of the city centre of George Town as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2008.

==Etymology==
George Town was named in honour of King George III, the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland between 1760 and 1820. Prior to the arrival of the British, the geographical area had been known as , due to the abundance of trees (&quot;Calophyllum inophyllum&quot;) found at the cape () of the city.

The city is often mistakenly spelled as &quot;Georgetown&quot;, which was never the city&#x27;s official name. This misspelling may be due to confusion with other places worldwide that share the same name. In common parlance, the city of George Town is also called &quot;Penang&quot;, which is the name of the larger state.

==History==


=== Establishment ===
In 1771, Francis Light, a former Royal Navy captain, was instructed by the British East India Company (EIC) to establish trade relations in the Malay Peninsula. He arrived in Kedah, a Siamese vassal state facing threats from the Bugis of Selangor. Kedah&#x27;s ruler Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II offered Light Penang Island in exchange for British military protection. Light noted the strategic potential of the island as a &quot;convenient magazine for trade&quot; that could enable the British to check Dutch and French territorial ambitions in Southeast Asia, and tried unsuccessfully to persuade his superiors to accept the Sultan&#x27;s offer.

Light was finally authorised to negotiate the British acquisition of Penang Island in 1786. After the cession was finalised with Muhammad Jiwa&#x27;s successor Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah, Light and his entourage landed on the island on 17 July that year. They took formal possession of the island &quot;in the name of King George III of England&quot; on 11 August. Penang Island was renamed Prince of Wales Island after the heir to the British throne. George Town was the first British colonial possession in Southeast Asia and marked the beginning of the gradual British colonisation in Malaya.

When Light first landed on the cape, it was densely covered in jungle. After the area was cleared, Light oversaw the construction of Fort Cornwallis, the first structure in the newly established settlement. The first roads of George Town Light, Beach, Chulia and Pitt streets were created in a grid-like configuration. This urban planning method facilitated the easy division, transaction and assessment of land, as well as efficient military deployment. The grid pattern was also replicated in Singapore following the acquisition of the island by Stamford Raffles in 1819.

=== British rule ===
As Light intended, George Town grew rapidly as a free port and a conduit for spice trade, taking maritime commerce from Dutch posts in the region. The spice trade allowed the EIC to cover the administrative costs of Penang. The threat of French invasion in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars forced the British to enlarge and reinforce Fort Cornwallis as the garrison for the settlement.

Local governance committees were formed from 1796 to resolve specific matters of administration. However, there were no unified legal systems in place to maintain order in the settlement. Light, who believed that feudal laws instituted by the newly-immigrated settlers were incompatible with British law, initially implemented a system in 1792 whereby matters of justice were partially delegated to local leaders. This decision was ratified by Lieutenant-Governor George Leith in 1800. However, further legal disputes meant that under the directives of the Bengal Presidency, this system was replaced by a set of regulations in 1805, drafted by Leith and revised by John Dickens, the presidency&#x27;s appointed judge and magistrate for Penang.

In 1807, a Charter of Justice was granted which mandated the establishment of a &quot;Court of Judicature&quot; composed of the Governor, a recorder and three councillors. The high court was inaugurated at Fort Cornwallis in the following year, with Edmond Stanley as recorder. With the establishment of the court, George Town became the first settlement in British Malaya to possess a modern judicial system.

In 1826, George Town was made the capital of the Straits Settlements, which also comprised Singapore and Malacca. In 1832, the administrative centre was relocated to Singapore, as it surpassed George Town in commercial and strategic prominence. Despite its secondary importance to Singapore, George Town continued to play a crucial role as a British entrepôt. Following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and a tin mining boom in the Malay Peninsula, the Port of Penang became a leading exporter of tin. By the end of the 19th century, George Town emerged as the foremost financial centre of British Malaya, as mercantile firms and international banks were established.

Throughout the century, George Town&#x27;s population grew rapidly in tandem with economic prosperity. Between 1797 and 1830, an influx of immigrants from all over Asia quadrupled its population. A cosmopolitan population emerged, comprising Chinese, Malay, Indian, Peranakan, Siamese and migrants of mixed European-Asian lineage referred to as &quot;Eurasians&quot;. The population growth also created social problems, such as inadequate health facilities and rampant crime, with the latter culminating in rioting in 1867.

George Town came under direct British rule when the Straits Settlements became a British crown colony in 1867. Law enforcement and immigration control were gradually strengthened to suppress organised crime. More investments were also made on the settlement&#x27;s health care and public transportation.

Advances in education and living standards gave rise to a non-European gentry and middle class, which in turn fostered nascent intellectual activities and political movements. George Town, according to historian Mary Turnbull, emerged as &quot;a Mecca for Asian intellectuals&quot;, who perceived it to be more intellectually receptive than Singapore. The settlement was a centre for reformist newspapers, and attracted political and intellectual figures such as Rudyard Kipling, W. Somerset Maugham and Sun Yat-sen. However, political turmoil in Qing China and the influx of Chinese migrants posed security concerns among the British authorities. Sun chose George Town as the headquarters for revolutionary activities by the Tongmenghui in Southeast Asia that eventually launched the Wuchang Uprising, a precursor to the Xinhai Revolution that ushered in the beginning of Republican China.

=== World wars ===
George Town emerged from World War I relatively unscathed, except for the Battle of Penang where the Imperial German Navy cruiser SMS &quot;Emden&quot; sank two Allied warships off the settlement. World War II, on the other hand, caused unprecedented social and political turmoil in George Town.

In mid-December 1941, the settlement was subjected to severe Japanese aerial bombardment, forcing inhabitants to flee George Town and take refuge in the jungles. While Penang Island had been designated a fortress before the outbreak of fighting, the British high command led by Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival decided to abandon the island and secretly evacuate George Town&#x27;s European population, leaving the settlement&#x27;s Asian residents undefended against the Japanese advance. According to historian Raymond Callahan, &quot;the moral collapse of British rule in Southeast Asia came not at Singapore, but at Penang&quot;.

The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) seized George Town on 19 December without encountering any resistance. During Japanese occupation, George Town was only lightly garrisoned by the IJA, while the Imperial Japanese Navy converted Swettenham Pier into a major submarine base for the Axis powers. Japanese military police imposed order by massacring Chinese civilians under the Sook Ching policy; the victims were buried in mass graves all over the island, such as at Rifle Range, Bukit Dumbar and Batu Ferringhi. Poverty and wanton Japanese brutality towards the local population also forced women into sexual slavery.

Between 1944 and 1945, Allied bombers based in India targeted naval and administrative buildings in George Town, damaging and destroying several colonial buildings in the process. The Penang Strait was mined to constrict Japanese shipping. Following Japan&#x27;s surrender, on 3 September 1945, British Royal Marines launched Operation Jurist to retake George Town, making it the first settlement in British Malaya to be liberated from the Japanese.

=== Post-war ===
After a period of military administration, the British dissolved the Straits Settlements in 1946 and merged the Crown Colony of Penang into the Malayan Union, which was then replaced with the Federation of Malaya in 1948. At first, the impending annexation of the British colony of Penang into the vast Malay heartland proved unpopular among Penangites. Partly due to concerns that George Town&#x27;s free port status would be at risk in the event of Penang&#x27;s absorption into Malaya&#x27;s customs union, the Penang Secessionist Committee was founded in 1948 and attempted to avert Penang&#x27;s merger with Malaya. A petition at the time warned that the incorporation of Penang into Malaya would &quot;reduce it to the churn of filth of a fishing village... trade assiduously built up during the last one and a half centuries will be turned to nothing, entailing untold monetary losses and hardship to the merchants in Penang&quot;.

The secessionist movement was ultimately met with British disapproval. To assuage the concerns raised by the secessionists, the British government guaranteed George Town&#x27;s free port status and promised greater decentralisation. Meanwhile, municipal elections, which had been abolished in 1913, were reintroduced in 1951, further diminishing the secessionists&#x27; commitment to their cause. Nine councillors were to be elected from George Town&#x27;s three electoral wards, while the British High Commissioner held the power to appoint six more. In 1957, George Town became Malaya&#x27;s first fully-elected municipality and was granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II. This made George Town the first city within the Malayan Federation, and by extension, Malaysia.

=== Post-independence ===

During the early years of Malaya&#x27;s independence, George Town retained its free port status, which had been guaranteed by the British. The George Town City Council enjoyed full financial autonomy and by 1965, it was the wealthiest local government in Malaysia, with an annual revenue almost double that of the Penang state government. This financial strength allowed the Labour-led city government to implement progressive policies, and to take control of George Town&#x27;s infrastructure and public transportation. These included the maintenance of its own public bus service, as well as the construction of public housing schemes and the Ayer Itam Dam.

However, longstanding political differences between the George Town City Council and the Alliance-controlled state government led to allegations of maladministration against the city government. In response, Chief Minister of Penang, Wong Pow Nee, took over the powers of the George Town City Council in 1966. Local government elections nationwide were also suspended in the aftermath of the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, never to be reinstated.

The period of relative prosperity vis-à-vis the rest of Malaysia came to an end in 1969, when the Malaysian federal government rescinded George Town&#x27;s free port status. This sparked massive unemployment, brain drain and urban decay within the city. The federal government also began channelling resources towards the development of Kuala Lumpur and Port Klang, leading to George Town&#x27;s protracted decline.

To revive Penang&#x27;s fortunes, newly-elected Chief Minister Lim Chong Eu launched the Komtar project in 1974 and spearheaded the establishment of the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone (Bayan Lepas FIZ) which, at the time, was outside the city. Although these were successful in transforming Penang into a tertiary-based economy, they also led to the decentralisation of the urban population as residents gravitated towards newer suburban townships closer to the Bayan Lepas FIZ. The destruction of hundreds of shophouses and whole streets for the construction of Komtar further exacerbated the hollowing out of George Town.

Between 1974 and 1976, the George Town City Council and the Penang Island Rural District Council were merged to form the Penang Island Municipal Council. This led to a prolonged debate over George Town&#x27;s city status, in spite of Clause 3 of the Local Government (Merger of the City Council of George Town and the Rural District Council of Penang Island) Order, 1974, which stated that &quot;the status of the City of George Town as a city shall continue to be preserved and maintained and shall remain unimpaired by the merger hereby effected&quot;.

=== Renaissance ===

George Town had benefitted from a real estate boom towards the end of the 20th century, but in 2001, the Rent Control Act was repealed, worsening the depopulation of the city&#x27;s historical core and leaving colonial-era buildings in disrepair. The city also suffered from incoherent urban planning, poor traffic management and a brain drain which left it without the expertise to regulate urban development and arrest its decline.

In response, George Town&#x27;s civil societies banded together and galvanised public support for the conservation of historic buildings, and to restore the city to its former glory. Following subsequent heritage conservation efforts, a portion of the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008.

Widespread resentment over the city&#x27;s decline also resulted in the then opposition Pakatan Rakyat bloc (now Pakatan Harapan) wresting power in Penang from the incumbent Barisan Nasional (BN) administration in the 2008 state election. The newly-elected state government took a more inclusive approach to heritage conservation and sustainable urban development, while concurrently pursuing economic diversification. The city has since witnessed an economic rejuvenation, boosted by a growth in the private sector.

George Town&#x27;s jurisdiction was expanded by the Malaysian federal government to encompass the entirety of Penang Island and the surrounding islets in 2015. This expansion resulted in an enlargement of the city government&#x27;s manpower and responsibilities, as well as enhancing the regulation of heritage conservation.

== Geography ==

The jurisdiction of George Town covers an area of approximately , encompassing the entirety of Penang Island and nine surrounding islets. George Town is slightly more than two-fifths the size of Singapore. The Penang Island has an uneven terrain with a mountainous topography down the middle. The island&#x27;s coastal plains are narrow, with the most extensive plain located at the northeastern cape, where the city centre is situated. Over the centuries, the built-up area of George Town has expanded in three directions along the island&#x27;s northern coast, south down the eastern shoreline and towards Penang Hill to the west.

The surrounding islets within George Town&#x27;s jurisdiction are Jerejak, Andaman, Udini, Tikus, Lovers&#x27;, Betong, Betong Kecil, Kendi and Rimau islands. The riverine systems within the city include the Kluang, Dua, Glugor and Pinang rivers. The Pinang River, which is long, flows through the city centre.

Penang Hill, with a height of , is the highest point in Penang, serving as a water catchment area and a green lung for the city. In 2021, the Penang Hill Biosphere Reserve, which includes the Penang Botanic Gardens and the Penang National Park, was inscribed as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in recognition of the area&#x27;s biodiversity.

As land scarcity is a pressing issue in George Town, land reclamation has been extensively undertaken at high-demand areas, such as at Tanjong Tokong and Bayan Lepas. Between 1960 and 2015, George Town expanded by more than due to land reclamation that altered much of the city&#x27;s eastern shoreline. In 2023, a massive reclamation project commenced off Bayan Lepas to build the Silicon Island, envisioned as a new hub for high-tech manufacturing and commerce. Reclamation projects to create Gurney Bay and the nearby mixed-use precinct of Andaman Island are also ongoing.
===Climate===
George Town features a tropical rainforest climate, under the Köppen climate classification (&quot;Af&quot;). Weather forecast in George Town is served by the Penang Meteorological Office at Bayan Lepas, which acts as the primary weather forecast facility for northwestern Peninsular Malaysia. The city experiences relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year, with an average high of about 32 °C and an average low of 24°C. It sees on average about of precipitation annually. Its proximity to the island of Sumatra makes George Town susceptible to dust particles carried by wind from transient forest fires that cause the perennial Southeast Asian haze.

==Governance and politics==

=== Local governance ===

In 1796, a committee was formed to record trade revenue, and another committee responsible for property valuation was established in 1800. The latter committee was assembled through an election of ratepaying representatives, making it the first political election ever held in the settlement. Although the committees were organised ad hoc and lacked regulatory power, these early measures marked the beginning of a systematic approach to municipal governance in Penang.

In 1856, the India Board, an administrative body of British India, passed Act No. XXVII, which mandated the appointment of Municipal Commissioners and taxation of the Straits Settlements. A Municipal Commission for George Town came into being the following year. In 1957, prior to Malaya&#x27;s independence, Queen Elizabeth II granted George Town city status, making it the first city in the new nation. By then, George Town had also become the first municipality in Malaya to have a fully-elected local government. Following the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, local government elections across the country have been suspended since 1965.

The Penang Island City Council (MBPP), headquartered in the City Hall, carries out the official administrative and legislative duties of the city. One of the two city governments in Penang, MBPP is led by a mayor, assisted by a secretary and 24 councillors who perform oversight responsibilities over 19 departments. Each councillor is appointed by the Penang state government under an extendable one-year term. , one of the 24 councillor positions has been allocated to the city&#x27;s non-governmental organisations (NGOs), while the remaining 23 are occupied by component parties of the ruling state government. The mayor since 2023 is Rajendran P. Anthony, the second mayor of Indian descent in the city&#x27;s history after D. S. Ramanathan and the first since 2015.

MBPP&#x27;s current urban planning strategy is set out in the &quot;Penang Island Local Plan 2030&quot;, first published in 2022. The city government is responsible for municipal services including waste management, public maintenance and community service. It is also involved in major infrastructural projects such as the Jalan Bukit Kukus Paired Road. Since 2009, it has operated the Central Area Transit (CAT) bus service in collaboration with Rapid Penang. In 2025, MBPP projected its estimated revenue at RM433.3 million and an estimated expenditure of RM466.3 million, which included allocations for smart city projects, economic growth, cleanliness, sustainability and urban mobility.

After Pakatan Rakyat (predecessor to the incumbent Pakatan Harapan) was voted into power in 2008, the newly-elected state government attempted to reinstate local government elections within Penang. Backed by strong support from George Town&#x27;s NGOs, the Local Government Elections (Penang Island and Province Wellesley) Enactment was passed in 2012, which would have allowed city government elections for the first time since the 1960s. However, the Barisan Nasional-controlled federal government objected to the move and the Federal Court later ruled that local government elections are not within the purview of state governments.

=== State and national representation ===

George Town is the administrative capital of Penang. The offices of the Chief Minister of Penang and the Penang state government are located in Komtar, while the official residence of the Governor of Penang is located in Scotland Road. Penang&#x27;s legislature has been convened in the State Assembly Building in Light Street since 1959.

George Town is represented by six Members of Parliament and 19 state constituencies. Prior to 2023, state elections had been conducted simultaneously with nationwide general elections every five years. Tanjong is the smallest parliamentary constituency in Malaysia by area. Padang Kota is the least populated state constituency by population, while Pengkalan Kota is the densest in the country. Batu Lancang has the largest proportion of Chinese residents in any state constituency.

Due to George Town&#x27;s predominantly Chinese population and the longstanding political consciousness, the city has been regarded as a stronghold for the incumbent Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition. , non-Malays formed the majority in 15 out of the 19 state constituencies in George Town, particularly around the city centre. In the 2023 state election, PH retained 17 of George Town&#x27;s state constituencies, with the far-right Perikatan Nasional (PN) opposition bloc seizing two of the Malay-majority seats at the western edge of the city.

=== Judiciary ===
George Town is the judicial capital of Penang. The city&#x27;s judicial system consists of the magistrate, sessions and the high court. The Penang High Court, the state&#x27;s supreme judicial authority, is located in Light Street. Established in 1808, the high court is regarded as the birthplace of the modern Malaysian judiciary. Notable lawyers who served the Penang High Court include Tunku Abdul Rahman, Cecil Rajendra and Karpal Singh.

The city also has two magistrate and sessions courts serving the Northeast and Southwest districts respectively, with the former located in Light Street and the latter housed in Balik Pulau. The Royal Malaysia Police is responsible for law enforcement within George Town, establishing a total of 22 police stations throughout the city . Traffic law enforcement is augmented by MBPP&#x27;s traffic warden unit, the first unit of its kind outside Kuala Lumpur.

According to the 2020 Malaysian census, George Town&#x27;s population was 794,313, out of which 158,336 or almost 20% resided within the city centre. With a population density of approximately , George Town is also one of the most densely populated cities in Malaysia. The city&#x27;s identity has been largely shaped by centuries of intermingling between the various cultures on its shores. The George Town Conurbation, which also covers Seberang Perai, and parts of neighbouring Kedah and Perak, was home to 2,843,344 residents , making it the second largest metropolitan area in Malaysia after the Klang Valley.

===Ethnicities===
Historically, George Town has been a predominantly Chinese city. According to the 1891 Straits Settlements census, about 68% of George Town&#x27;s population of 51,627 were ethnic Chinese. , Chinese formed more than half of the city&#x27;s population.

During British rule, the Chinese in George Town were categorised based on their dialects, such as Hokkien, Cantonese, Hainanese and Teochew, as well as place of birth. In contrast to newer arrivals known colloquially as &quot;sinkheh&quot;, the Peranakan Chinese, descendants of mixed Malay and Chinese ancestries who had inhabited the Straits Settlements for generations, formed an influential group within the Chinese community. They generally preferred Western education, and held leadership positions in some of George Town&#x27;s commercial and community associations. As the Peranakan Chinese tended to be more loyal to the British Crown than to China, they were also known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Chinese&quot;. Although Malaysia&#x27;s ethnic policies have effectively forced the Peranakan Chinese to identify themselves with the larger Chinese community, Peranakan Chinese culture still thrives in the city, visible in Straits Chinese architectural styles and dishes like asam laksa.

The &quot;Bumiputeras&quot;, which include ethnic Malays and East Malaysian indigenous races like the Dayaks and Kadazans, collectively made up 31% of the city&#x27;s population in 2020. , George Town has seen growing arrivals of Sabahan and Sarawakian natives migrating to the city for employment opportunities in sectors like manufacturing, healthcare and the civil service. Ethnic Indians comprised another 8% of George Town&#x27;s population. Additionally, there are small but prominent Eurasian and Siamese enclaves such as Kampung Siam and Kampong Serani.

Close to 8.5% of the city&#x27;s population consisted of non-Malaysian citizens. George Town&#x27;s affordable living costs, natural destinations, advanced healthcare infrastructure, its established ecosystem of multinational companies (MNCs) and the widespread use of English have been cited as factors that made the city attractive to expatriates. , George Town was ranked second in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur and 122nd globally for liveability by ECA International. It has also been described by news outlets such as &quot;CNN&quot; as one of the best cities for retirement in the world.

Throughout George Town&#x27;s history as a cosmopolitan port of clearance and departure, it attracted a polyglot society consisting of various other communities such as Burmese, Acehnese, Arabs, Jews, Japanese and Armenians. While most of these other communities no longer exist, they left their legacy to several landmarks and street names such as the Dhammikarama Burmese Temple, Armenian Street and the Jewish Cemetery.

===Languages===

Major languages in common use by George Town&#x27;s multilingual, cosmopolitan society are Malay, English, Hokkien, Mandarin and Tamil. Penang Hokkien, a local variant of the Hokkien dialect, is widely used as the unofficial &quot;lingua franca&quot; between the various ethnic groups in the city.

During British rule, English was the official language in Penang, and was used as the medium of instruction in secular and mission schools. The combination of Western education and the importance of English for global trade has created distinct English-speaking groups within the Chinese and Indian communities, in contrast to those who have received vernacular education.

Like in the rest of Malaysia, Malay is currently Penang&#x27;s official language. The Malays and Jawi Peranakans in the city often use &quot;Bahasa Tanjong&quot;, a variant of the Kedah Malay dialect that is slightly modified to suit the conditions of a cosmopolitan society. Meanwhile, the Tamils form the bulk of George Town&#x27;s Indian community. Tamil is used as the medium of instruction in Tamil-medium primary schools. Other Indian languages that are spoken in the city include Telugu and Punjabi.

George Town&#x27;s Chinese community uses a variety of Chinese dialects, including Teochew, Hakka and Cantonese. Mandarin is the medium of instruction in Chinese schools, contributing to its more prevalent use among youths. Originally a variant of the Southern Min group of languages, Penang Hokkien has absorbed numerous loanwords from Malay and English, yet another legacy of the Peranakan Chinese culture. Although Penang Hokkien is still widely spoken within the city centre, its use has been waning in recent years in the face of the increasing prevalence of Mandarin and English.

In 2008, the newly-elected Pakatan Rakyat state government introduced bilingual street signs throughout George Town. These street signs display the names of streets in either English, Chinese, Tamil or Arabic alongside the official Malay language, highlighting the city&#x27;s multilingual character. However, this move was not without controversy, as the street signs occasionally became targets of vandalism by political extremists opposing the city&#x27;s cosmopolitanism.

==Economy==
As the capital city of Penang, one of the only four high-income territories in Malaysia, George Town has a diversified service sector. The city&#x27;s economy is largely driven by services and manufacturing, particularly electronics and optical manufacturing, hospitality, wholesale and retail trade, logistics, finance, and real estate. In 2020, George Town&#x27;s GDP was RM51.935 billion (US$12.464 billion), accounting for 53.5% of Penang&#x27;s total GDP. George Town&#x27;s GDP per capita was RM65,383 (US$15,692), surpassing the World Bank&#x27;s threshold of US$12,696 to be considered a high-income economy.

With at least 300 multinational companies (MNCs), the robust manufacturing sector has contributed to George Town emerging as Malaysia&#x27;s leading exporter and one of the major destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country. George Town is the core city of the George Town Conurbation, which had a GDP worth US$30.2 billion in 2020, the second largest economy in Malaysia after the Klang Valley.

According to Euromonitor International in 2023, George Town exhibits the greatest potential among Malaysian cities for revenue growth. The Economist Intelligence Unit had also reported that in 2015, the city contributed US$12,044 or almost 8% of Malaysia&#x27;s personal disposable income in 2015, second only to Kuala Lumpur. Knight Frank&#x27;s 2016 rankings positioned George Town as Malaysia&#x27;s most attractive destination for commercial property investment, surpassing even the federal capital. George Town was rated a &quot;Gamma −&quot; level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2020, due to its capacity in &quot;advanced producer services&quot; namely finance and insurance. In 2024, George Town ranked 351st in the Oxford Economics Global Cities Index, the eighth highest within the ASEAN region and the second in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur. Additionally, the city has developed extensive logistical connections through the Penang International Airport and Swettenham Pier.

=== Manufacturing ===

Following the revocation of George Town&#x27;s free port status and the fall of the Alliance-led state government in 1969, newly-elected Chief Minister Lim Chong Eu sought to revamp Penang&#x27;s economy and commissioned Robert R. Nathan Associates to formulate strategies. The resulting Nathan Report of 1970 recommended an export-led growth strategy and the strengthening of linkages with the global economy.

As a part of this economic transformation, the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone (Bayan Lepas FIZ) was established in 1972. The zone has played a significant role in Penang&#x27;s economic growth over the decades since. It is regarded as the &quot;Silicon Valley of the East&quot;, home to more than 300 multinational companies (MNCs) including 39 Fortune 1000 companies. Among the MNCs within the Bayan Lepas FIZ are technology firms such as AMD, Bosch, HP Inc., Intel, Motorola, Osram and Renesas.

The electronics ecosystem and supply chain comprising both MNCs and large local companies (LLCs) have solidified George Town&#x27;s position as a major destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) and Malaysia&#x27;s top exporter. In 2021, Penang captured RM74.4 billion in inbound FDI, with the Bayan Lepas FIZ contributing over 95%. In 2022, the Penang International Airport (PIA), which lies adjacent to the zone, saw an estimated RM385 billion worth of exports, making it the largest exporter of all ports of entry in Malaysia. The successful electronics manufacturing sector has also encouraged a growth in start-ups, driven by home-grown companies like Piktochart and DeliverEat.

=== Finance ===
George Town was once the financial centre of British Malaya. During the late 19th century, many international banks such as Standard Chartered, HSBC, and the Royal Bank of Scotland established themselves in the city, leading to the clustering of mercantile trade around the northern end of Beach Street. Post-independence, George Town continues to function as the financial hub of northern Malaysia. The city&#x27;s financial and commercial precincts expanded around Northam Road and Pulau Tikus by the 1990s.

The Penang Island City Council formally proposed the Central Business District (CBD) as one of the city&#x27;s four economic zones in its &quot;Local Plan 2030&quot;, along with the Bayan BaruBayan Lepas, Tanjong TokongTanjong Bungah and Batu FerringhiTeluk Bahang corridors. Designated as a financial and banking district, the CBD covers a significant portion within the city centre up to the northern bank of the Pinang River, including existing financial precincts of Beach Street, Northam Road and Pulau Tikus, as well as a Business Improvement District (BIDS) around Komtar. Apart from banking and ancillary services, the CBD is home to federal financial institutions like Bank Negara and the Employees Provident Fund. In 2022, finance and ancillary services contributed 9.1% of Penang&#x27;s GDP.

=== Services ===

George Town has traditionally been one of Malaysia&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations. It has attracted influential personalities like Somerset Maugham, Rudyard Kipling, Noël Coward, Lee Kuan Yew and Queen Elizabeth II. The city is recognised for its architecture and diverse cultures, natural attractions like beaches and hills, and its culinary scene.

Unlike most cities in Malaysia, George Town is not solely dependent on air transportation for tourist arrivals. Swettenham Pier, the busiest port-of-call in Malaysia for cruise shipping, serves as a major entry point into the city along with PIA. In addition to its role as a freight exporter, the PIA ranks as the third busiest airport in the country in passenger volume.

Measures to promote economic diversification have led to George Town expanding tourism offerings in specific areas such as healthcare, business events, ecotourism and cruise arrivals. The city is home to several private hospitals, contributing to Penang&#x27;s emergence as the leading destination in Malaysia for medical tourism. George Town is the country&#x27;s second most popular destination for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) after Kuala Lumpur, with the industry had an economic impact of about RM1.3 billion throughout Penang in 2018. Some of the major venues for business events within the city are SPICE Arena, Straits Quay and Prangin Mall.

As the main shopping destination of northwestern Malaysia, George Town&#x27;s retail scene includes shopping malls like Gurney Plaza, Gurney Paragon, 1st Avenue Mall, Straits Quay, Sunshine Central and Queensbay Mall. The city&#x27;s traditional shophouses and markets continue to thrive, offering various local products unique to Penang such as nutmegs, Heong Peng and Tambun biscuits.

In 2004, the Bayan Lepas FIZ and the adjacent township of Bayan Baru were accorded Multimedia Super Corridor Cyber City status, paving the way for George Town&#x27;s growth as a shared services and outsourcing (SSO) hub. By 2016, Penang attracted the second largest share of investments for global business services (GBS) within Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur, creating over 8,000 high-income jobs in the process. Newer office spaces at Bayan Baru have attracted multinational companies including Cisco, Citigroup, Clarivate, Swarovski and Teleperformance to establish GBS offices at the area.

== Cityscape ==
=== Architecture ===
In 2008, UNESCO designated nearly within the city centre as a World Heritage Site. Recognised for the British-era cityscape, the city centre is notable for its &quot;unique architectural and cultural townscape without parallel anywhere in East and Southeast Asia&quot;, according to UNESCO. Largely bounded by Transfer Road to the west and Prangin Road to the south, the UNESCO-protected site is further demarcated into a core zone surrounded by a buffer zone.

The Penang Island City Council has officially identified 3,642 heritage buildings inside the UNESCO-demarcated zone. Shophouses sit alongside Anglo-Indian bungalows, mosques, temples, churches, and European-style administrative and commercial complexes, shaping the city&#x27;s multicultural framework. Among the landmarks within the zone that feature various Asian architectural styles are the Khoo Kongsi, Kapitan Keling Mosque and Sri Mahamariamman Temple. Elsewhere in the city, the influence of Siamese and Burmese cultures can be seen at places of worship like Wat Chayamangkalaram, Dhammikarama Burmese Temple and Kek Lok Si.

Apart from the colonial-era architecture, George Town is also home to most of Penang&#x27;s skyscrapers. The tallest skyscrapers in the city include the Komtar Tower, Marriott Residences and Muze @ PICC. There has been a surge in demand for residential high-rises at the suburbs since 2015, driven by the growing need for strata housing and the city&#x27;s thriving economy.

=== Parks ===

Established in 1884 by botanist Nathaniel Cantley, the Penang Botanic Gardens was Malaysia&#x27;s first botanical garden. It is dedicated to botanical and horticultural research, as well as wildlife conservation within the area. The botanical garden forms part of the Penang Hill Biosphere Reserve, recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve since 2021. Nearby, the City Park was opened in 1972 as a public recreational space in the aftermath of the 1969 race riots in Kuala Lumpur.

Spanning within the Penang Hill Biosphere Reserve, the Penang National Park covers of coastal hills, meromictic lakes, mangroves, coral reefs, and turtle-nesting beaches like Pantai Kerachut, Pantai Mas, Teluk Kampi and Teluk Ketapang. Gazetted by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks in 2003, this forest reserve has been earmarked by the Penang state government as a key eco-tourism destination within the city.

Described as &quot;a new iconic waterfront destination for Penang&quot; by then Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng, Gurney Bay is a park being built on reclaimed land off Gurney Drive. It is divided into four sections featuring a food and beverage (F&amp;B) area, water gardens, a man-made beach and a coastal grove. The first phase of Gurney Bay was opened to public in 2024.

As part of efforts to create accessible green spaces and counter climate change within George Town, the Penang Island City Council is developing of interconnecting parks and waterways throughout the city. The Penang Green Connectors Project envisions ecological corridors that include of coastal parks and of riverine systems designated as &quot;blue corridors&quot;, in addition to the construction of pedestrian and cycling paths in the city.

== Culture ==
=== Arts ===

The Penang variant of the Chingay procession was introduced in George Town in 1919. It is characterised by the act of balancing gigantic flags on one&#x27;s head or hands. Formerly infused with rituals from the Chinese underworld, Chingay parades are now held annually in the city as a tourist attraction by itself and continue to be a major expression of the Penang Chinese identity. George Town was also the birthplace of Bangsawan, a form of Malay theatre that incorporates Indian, Western, Islamic, Chinese and Indonesian influences. Boria, another unique form of theatre that features singing accompanied by violin, maracas and tabla, was first performed in the city in the mid-19th century.

Apart from these, George Town has emerged as a hub for the arts and culture scene in Malaysia. The designation of parts of the city centre as a UNESCO World Heritage Site has enhanced cultural and creative industries within the area. Since its inception in 2010, the George Town Festival is one of the major yearly arts events in Southeast Asia. Held annually since 2011, the George Town Literary Festival won the International Literary Festival Award at the London Book Fair in 2018, the first such event from Southeast Asia to receive this honour.

In 2012, Lithuanian artist Ernest Zacharevic created a series of murals showcasing local culture, inhabitants and lifestyles. The city is also adorned with 52 wrought iron caricatures and 18 wall murals that depict its history and the daily lives of the local community. Additionally, art exhibitions are held at event spaces like the Hin Bus Depot and Sia Boey.

=== Cuisine ===
George Town&#x27;s culinary scene incorporates Malay, Chinese, Indian, Peranakan and Thai influences, evident in the range of available street food that includes char kway teow, asam laksa and nasi kandar. Described by &quot;CNN&quot; as &quot;the food capital of Malaysia&quot;, the city was also listed by &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; as one of the best in Asia for street food. According to &quot;Time&quot; in 2004, only in the city &quot;could food this good be this cheap&quot;. Robin Barton of the &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; described George Town as the &quot;culinary epicentre of the many cultures that arrived after it was set up as a trading port in 1786, from Malays to Indians, Acehenese to Chinese, Burmese to Thais&quot;.

Over the years, the city&#x27;s culinary scene has expanded to include fine dining establishments, adding to its already diverse array of street food options. In 2022, the &quot;Michelin Guide&quot; made its debut in Penang, in recognition of the state&#x27;s &quot;small-scale restaurants and street food that embodies Malaysia&#x27;s distinctive streetside dining culture&quot;. The 2025 edition of the &quot;Michelin Guide&quot; features 63 eateries throughout the city.
=== Sports ===

George Town is home to a variety of sports facilities. The 20,000-seater City Stadium serves as the home ground for Penang FC, while the SPICE Arena features an indoor arena and an aquatics centre. Malaysia&#x27;s oldest equestrian centre, the Penang Turf Club, is located within the city. Additionally, investments have also been made on dedicated training facilities for badminton and squash. George Town has played host to regional and international sports tournaments like the 2001 SEA Games, 2013 Women&#x27;s World Open Squash Championship and Asia&#x27;s first Masters Games in 2018.

Some of the more significant annual sporting events in the city include the Penang International Dragon Boat Festival and the Penang Bridge International Marathon. The Penang International Dragon Boat Festival takes place every December and attracts participants from abroad. The Penang Bridge International Marathon, which features the iconic Penang Bridge as its route, has also gained international recognition and attracted about 20,000 participants from 61 countries in 2023.

== Education ==
, George Town is home to 111 primary schools and 49 secondary schools. British colonial rule had encouraged the growth of mission schools throughout the city, including St. Xavier&#x27;s Institution, St. George&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School and Methodist Boys&#x27; School. Founded in 1816, Penang Free School (PFS) is the oldest English school in Southeast Asia.

In 1819, the first Chinese school in George Town was established, marking the start of Malaysia&#x27;s modern Chinese education system. While Chinese, English and mission schools have since been brought under the jurisdiction of the Malaysian Ministry of Education, the Penang state government also provides annual financial assistance to aid in the maintenance of these schools. George Town is also home to 12 international and expatriate schools that offer either British, American or International Baccalaureate syllabuses.

In 1969, Universiti Pulau Pinang was established as Malaysia&#x27;s second university and the first public tertiary institution in George Town. It was renamed Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) in 1972. , the university is ranked 146th in the QS World University Rankings, third in Malaysia after Universiti Malaya and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Most of the other tertiary institutions within the city are privately-run, including Wawasan Open University, Han Chiang University College of Communication, DISTED College and RCSI &amp; UCD Malaysia Campus. Headquartered at Gelugor, RECSAM is one of the 26 specialist institutions of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization.

In 2016, the state government launched Malaysia&#x27;s first digital library within the grounds of PFS. Conceptualised as a &quot;library in a park&quot; and a community space, the Penang Digital Library provides structured access to over 3,000 ebook titles. Following the success of the Penang Digital Library, similar libraries have been built at other locations within both the city and Seberang Perai.

== Healthcare ==

Healthcare in Penang is provided by a two-tier system made up of public and private hospitals. Administered and funded by the Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH), the 1,100-bed Penang General Hospital within the city centre is the main tertiary referral hospital of northwestern Malaysia. It is supported by the 81-bed Balik Pulau Hospital that serves the western part of the city.

In addition, 13 private hospitals are scattered throughout George Town. Operating independently of the MOH, private hospitals such as Penang Adventist Hospital, Loh Guan Lye Specialists Centre and Island Hospital have played a significant role in making Penang the top destination for medical tourists in Malaysia. While public and private hospitals typically operate separately, there have been instances of public-private cooperation, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic which saw private hospitals sharing equipment and taking in non-COVID-19 patients in need of urgent medical procedures.

== Media ==

=== Newspapers ===
George Town was once the centre of Malaysia&#x27;s print media. The country&#x27;s first newspaper was the &quot;Prince of Wales Island Gazette&quot;, founded in the city in 1806. The paper was shut down 21 years later, a victim of the stringent censorship that was prevalent in the early 19th century. Greater press freedom eventually emerged by the middle of the century, concurrent with the perceived political freedom in Penang which stood in contrast to the stronger government apparatus in Singapore.

Following Malaya&#x27;s independence in 1957, several major dailies moved to Kuala Lumpur due to its importance as the country&#x27;s administrative capital. &quot;The Star&quot;, one of Malaysia&#x27;s top English dailies, started as a regional newspaper that was first published in George Town in 1971. In addition, George Town is home to the nation&#x27;s oldest Chinese newspaper, &quot;Kwong Wah Yit Poh&quot;, which was established in 1910.

=== Film and television ===
George Town&#x27;s well-preserved colonial-era architecture has made the city a popular filming location for movies and television series that depict Asian culture. Films and series that were shot within the city include &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot;, &quot;Anna and the King&quot;, &quot;Lust, Caution&quot;, &quot;The Little Nyonya&quot; and &quot;You Mean the World to Me&quot;; the latter was the first movie to be produced entirely in Penang Hokkien. Additionally, George Town was featured as a pit-stop in &quot;The Amazing Race 16&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Race Asia 5&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Race Australia 7&quot;.

== Transportation ==

=== Land ===
George Town&#x27;s oldest roads Light, Beach, Chulia and Pitt streets were arranged nearly at right angles to each other in a grid pattern. Rapid urbanisation throughout the 20th century led to a gradual expansion of the city&#x27;s road network. George Town is physically connected to mainland Malay Peninsula by two road bridges the Penang Bridge and the Second Penang Bridge. Within the city, the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway is an important thoroughfare that runs along its eastern seaboard, connecting the city centre with the two bridges and the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone. The Federal Route 6 is a pan-island trunk road that circles the city, while the George Town Inner Ring Road functions as the main artery within the city centre.

====Public transportation====
George Town was formerly at the forefront of public transportation in Malaya. The first trams, originally powered by steam, were launched in the 1880s and gradually expanded throughout the settlement. Although trams became obsolete by 1936, another colonial legacy, the trishaw, remains in use primarily for tourists.

Public buses form the backbone of the city&#x27;s public transportation system. Since 2007, Rapid Penang has been the primary public bus operator in the city. , it ran 25 routes throughout George Town, and two cross-strait routes between the city and Seberang Perai.

Penang Hill Railway, a funicular railway to the peak of Penang Hill, is the only rail-based transportation system within the city. A cable car system is being built to reduce overreliance on the railway. To further alleviate traffic congestion, which saw average daily traffic reaching 64,144 vehicles in 2018, the Penang state government embarked on the Penang Transport Master Plan, which envisions the introduction of urban rail systems throughout George Town. In 2024, the Malaysian federal government announced a takeover of the Mutiara LRT line from the state government. The first domestic light rail system outside the Klang Valley, the line will connect the city centre with the Penang International Airport and Seberang Perai. Construction began in 2025 and is expected to be completed by 2031.

Efforts are also being undertaken to promote urban mobility by implementing pedestrianisation and providing cycling infrastructure. George Town became the first city in Malaysia to operate a public bicycle-sharing service, with the inauguration of LinkBike in 2016.

===Air===
The Penang International Airport (PIA) is located south of the city centre. It serves as the primary airport for northwestern Malaysia. PIA is Malaysia&#x27;s third busiest airport, recording over 7.6 million passengers in 2024. In 2023, exports worth RM385 billion passed through PIA, making the airport the top contributor to Malaysia&#x27;s export value. , the airport is undergoing upgrades aimed at raising its annual capacity from 6.5 million passengers to 12 million by 2028.

===Sea===
Swettenham Pier is one of the major entry points into George Town. In 2017, the pier saw 125 port calls by cruise ships, surpassing Port Klang as the busiest cruise shipping terminal in Malaysia. It has attracted some of the world&#x27;s largest cruise liners such as the &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; and also sees occasional port visits by warships.

Prior to the completion of the Penang Bridge in 1985, the Penang ferry service was the only transportation link between George Town and mainland Seberang Perai. At present, four ferries ply the Penang Strait between both cities daily, with the Raja Tun Uda Ferry Terminal serving as the dedicated docking facility in George Town.

== Utilities ==
George Town relies heavily on the Muda River, which forms the northern boundary between mainland Seberang Perai and Kedah, as its primary source of water. Treated water is delivered from the mainland to the island city via three sets of submarine pipelines. The Penang Water Supply Corporation (PBAPP) is also responsible for managing the 11 reservoirs in George Town, including two at Ayer Itam and Teluk Bahang that act as strategic reserves for the surrounding suburbs in the event of dry weather and supply disruptions from the mainland.

Electricity in George Town is supplied by Tenaga Nasional (TNB), the national power company. George Town&#x27;s power supply is drawn from the mainland via a RM500 million overhead power grid across the Penang Strait which replaced the older 330 MW Gelugor Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant in 2024. To reduce energy consumption, the Penang Island City Council and TNB replaced all 33,101 street lights throughout George Town with LED street lighting by 2023.

In 2020, Penang had become the first Malaysian state to make the installation of fibre-optic communication infrastructure mandatory for all development projects. In 2022, George Town saw the implementation of 5G, with the installation of the supporting spectrum infrastructure at 151 sites within the city. The Penang International Airport became the first airport in Malaysia to offer public 5G services that year. In 2024, DE-CIX inaugurated the Penang Internet Exchange (PIX), with internet traffic being routed through a data centre at Bayan Baru.

==International relations==
George Town is home to a substantial contingent of foreign diplomatic missions. , a total of 22 countries have either established consulates or appointed honorary consuls within the city. This list is based on information from the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, unless otherwise cited.

<text>Camille Hyacinthe Odilon Barrot (; 19 July 1791 – 6 August 1873) was a French politician who was briefly head of the council of ministers under king Louis Phillipe in 1848–49.

==Early life==
Barrot was born at Villefort, Lozère. He belonged to a legal family, his father, an advocate of Toulouse, having been a member of the Convention who had voted against the death of Louis XVI. Odilon Barrot&#x27;s earliest recollections were of the October insurrection of 1795. He was sent to the military school of Saint-Cyr, but later moved to the Lycee Napoleon to study law and was called to the Parisian bar in 1811.
He married the granddaughter of the liberal politician Guillaume-Xavier Labbey de Pompières (1751–1831).
He was the brother of Adolphe Barrot and Ferdinand Barrot.

He was placed in the office of the politician Jean Mailhe, who was advocate before the council of state and the court of cassation and was proscribed at the second restoration. Barrot eventually succeeded him in both positions. His dissatisfaction with the government of the restoration was shown in his conduct of some political trials. For his opposition in 1820 to a law by which any person might be arrested and detained on a warrant signed by three ministers, he was summoned before a court of assize, but acquitted.
Although intimate with Lafayette and others, he took no share in their schemes for the overthrow of the government, but in 1827 he joined the association known as &quot;Aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera&quot;.

==July Monarchy==

He presided over the banquet given by the society to the 221 deputies who had signed the address of March 1830 to Charles X, and threatened to reply to force by force. After the ordinances of 26 July 1830, he joined the National Guard and took an active part in the revolution. As secretary of the municipal commission, which sat at the hôtel-de-ville and formed itself into a provisional government, he was charged to convey to the chamber of deputies a protest embodying the terms which the advanced Liberals wished to impose on the king to be elected. He supported the idea of a constitutional monarchy against the extreme Republicans, and he was appointed one of the three commissioners chosen to escort Charles X out of France.

On his return he was nominated prefect of the Seine &quot;département&quot;. His concessions to the Parisian mob and his extreme gentleness towards those who demanded the prosecution of the ministers of Charles X led to an unflattering comparison with Jérôme Pétion under similar circumstances. Louis Philippe&#x27;s government was far from satisfying his desires for reform, and he persistently urged the &quot;broadening of the bases of the monarchy,&quot; while he protested his loyalty to the dynasty. He was returned to the chamber of deputies for the department of Eure in 1831. The day after the demonstration of June 1832 on the occasion of the funeral of General Lamarque, he made himself indirectly the mouthpiece of the Democrats in an interview with Louis Philippe, which is given at length in his &quot;Mêmoires&quot;. Subsequently, in pleading before the court of cassation on behalf of one of the rioters, he secured the annulling of the judgments given by the council of war.

The death of the Duke of Orleans in 1842 was a blow to Barrot&#x27;s party, which sought to substitute the regency of the Duchess of Orleans for that of the Duke of Nemours in the event of the succession of the Comte de Paris. In 1846 Barrot made a tour in the Near East, returning in time to take part a second time in the preliminaries of revolution. He organized banquets of the disaffected in the various cities of France, and demanded electoral reform to avoid revolution. He did not foresee the strength of the outbreak for which his eloquence had prepared the way, and clung to the programme of 1830. He tried to support the regency of the duchess in the chamber on 24 February, only to find that the time was past for half-measures.

==Second Republic==

After the Revolution of 1848, Barrot acquiesced to the republic and gave his support to General Cavaignac.

In the December 1848 election for President of the republic, Napoleon won with 5,434,266 votes to 1,448,107 for Cavaignac. Napoleon took his oath on 20 December 1848 a day ahead of schedule, and appointed a ministry that included Barrot and the conservative Frédéric Alfred Pierre, comte de Falloux.
Barrot was Minister of Justice and &quot;president of the council of ministers when Napoleon was absent&quot;.
Following national elections, the Constituent Assembly was replaced by the Legislative Assembly, which sat for the first time on 28 May 1849. On 2 June 1849 a new ministry was announced, again headed by Barrot. It included de Tocqueville as Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
This ministry was dissolved by Napoleon on 31 October 1849.
The new ministry did not have a &quot;president when Napoleon was absent&quot;.
A biographer said that Barrot had hoped to extract Liberal measures, but was dismissed as soon as he had served the president&#x27;s purpose of avoiding open conflict.

==Later career==
After the coup d&#x27;état of December 1851 Barrot was one of those who sought to accuse Napoleon of high treason. He was imprisoned for a short time and retired from active politics for some ten years. He was drawn once more into affairs by the hopes of reform held out by Émile Ollivier, accepting in 1869 the presidency of an extraparliamentary committee on decentralization. After the fall of the empire he was nominated by Adolphe Thiers, whom he had supported under Louis Philippe, as president of the council of state, but his powers were failing, and he had only filled his new office for about a year when he died at Bougival.

Barrot was described by Paul Thureau-Dangin as &quot;the most solemn of the undecided, the most meditating of the unwise, the happiest of the ambitious, the most austere of the courtiers of the crowd&quot; (&quot;le plus solennel des indécis, le plus méditatif des irréfléchis, le plus heureux des ambitieux, le plus austere des courtisans de la foule&quot;).

<text>Enrique José O&#x27;Donnell y Anatar, conde de La Bisbal or (English: Henry Joseph O&#x27;Donnell) (1769 – 17 May 1834) was a Spanish general of Irish descent who fought in the Peninsular War.

==Biography==
O&#x27;Donnell was born in San Sebastián, a descendant of the Irish noble dynasty of O&#x27;Donnell of Tyrconnell who left Ireland after the Battle of the Boyne, A member of the branch of the family that settled in Austria, General Karl O&#x27;Donnell Count of Tyronnel (1715–1771), held important commands during the Seven Years&#x27; War. His father was Joseph O&#x27;Donnell y O&#x27;Donnell (1722–1787), Colonel of the Spanish Infantry Regiment of Ireland, Lieutenant General of the Spanish Army, and his mother was Mariana de Anethan y Mareshal, of Luxemburg.

Born in Spain, he early entered the Spanish army, fighting in 1793–1795 in the Convention War, and in 1810 became general, receiving a command in Catalonia, where in that year he earned his title and the rank of field-marshal. While fighting against General Gouvion-Saint-Cyr, (1764–1830), he managed to enter the besieged Girona and move troops to Vic. At the Battle of La Bisbal he defeated General Schwartz, earning thus the title of Count of La Bisbal although he was wounded in a leg.

In 1811 he was appointed Captain General of Valencia and from 22 January 1812 to 7 March 1813 he was one of the members of the III Council of Regency, taking part as a sort of shady patron in the revolt in Catalonia led by Captain General Luis Roberto de Lacy (San Roque, executed by firing squad at the Castle of Bellver, Palma de Mallorca, in 1817), and who was also descended from Irish-Spanish military people, and had tried to set up a Republic.

He afterwards held posts of great responsibility under Ferdinand VII. During the Liberal Triennium he supported the liberals despite his absolutist convictions, because he was against French intervention.

The events of 1823 compelled his flight into France to Limoges where he was interned. When King Ferdinand VII of Spain died in 1834, O&#x27;Donnell died in Montpellier on the way back to Spain.

==Family==
O&#x27;Donnell was the brother of Carlos O&#x27;Donnell y Mareschal, the father of general and politician Leopoldo O&#x27;Donnell y Jorris (invested as Duke of Tetuan and Count of Lucena), and father of Lieutenant General of the Spanish Army Enrique O&#x27;Donnell y Jorris.

<doc id="160734" wikidata="Q1637222" url="?curid=160734" title="Michael Beaumont, 22nd Seigneur of Sark">
<text>Seigneur John Michael Beaumont (20 December 1927 – 3 July 2016) was the twenty-second Seigneur of Sark in the Channel Islands. He worked as a civil engineer before succeeding his paternal grandmother, Sibyl Hathaway, the 21st Dame of Sark, in 1974. During his rule, Beaumont saw the loss of many feudal rights enjoyed by the seigneurs, and he was consequently often described as the &quot;last feudal baron&quot;.

== Family ==

Beaumont was the son of the Royal Air Force officer and film producer Francis William Beaumont and his first wife, Enid Ripley. His paternal grandmother, Sibyl Hathaway, ascended as the Dame of Sark six months before his birth.

Francis and Enid divorced in 1937 as a result of his adultery with an actress, Mary Lawson, whom he subsequently married.
Beaumont&#x27;s father and stepmother were killed on 4 May 1941, during the Liverpool Blitz, which left the 14-year-old Beaumont as heir to his grandmother.

Beaumont worked as a structural design engineer for the British Aircraft Corporation in Bristol before moving to Shoreham-by-Sea, where he worked on Beagle Aircraft. In 1956, Beaumont married Diana La Trobe-Bateman, and the couple had two sons, Christopher and Anthony.

== Seigneurship ==
In 1974, Beaumont&#x27;s grandmother died and he succeeded her as Seigneur of Sark. The new seigneur swore fealty to Queen Elizabeth in 1978, when she and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the island for the first time since his accession.

In 1990, a French nuclear physicist named André Gardes came to Sark to depose Beaumont and establish himself as seigneur, but this one-man &quot;invasion&quot; attempt failed.

During her 2001 visit, the Queen made the seigneur an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

In 2008, Sark experienced a major change in the system of government. Beaumont remained the overlord of the island, but lost some of his feudal privileges. He did retain the privilege of being the only person on the island with the right to keep pigeons and an unspayed dog.

The first democratic elections on the island took place in December 2008. Beaumont appreciated the fact that it allowed his island to stay independent from Guernsey.

== Final years ==

Due to their poor health, the aging seigneur and his wife moved out of La Seigneurie, the traditional residence of the ruler of the island, to a more manageable cottage on their estate. In 2009, they agreed to allow David Synnott and his wife to live in the Seigneurie for ten years—until the end of October 2019. The rent is paid through renovations, and Synnott said that the seigneur was &quot;effectively making a large and generous donation to his successor who will benefit from the work&quot;.

Beaumont&#x27;s heir, his son, Major Christopher Beaumont, lived and worked with his family in Britain and served as an officer in the Royal Engineers. In 2008, he told the Chief Pleas that he intended to move back to Sark upon inheriting the fief.

In 2011, the seigneur declared that he would never consider selling his fief. Beaumont died on 3 July 2016 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Christopher.

Beaumont&#x27;s widow, Diana, died on 1 December 2016. She was eighty years old when she died, which was less than five months after Beaumont&#x27;s death.

<doc id="160735" wikidata="Q146328" url="?curid=160735" title="Commonwealth of the Philippines">
<text>The Commonwealth of the Philippines (; ) was an unincorporated territory and commonwealth of the United States that existed from 1935 to 1946. It was established following the Tydings–McDuffie Act to replace the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands and was designed as a transitional administration in preparation for full Philippine independence. Its foreign affairs remained managed by the United States.

During its more than a decade of existence, the Commonwealth had a strong executive and a supreme court. Its legislature, dominated by the Nacionalista Party, was at first unicameral but later bicameral. In 1937, the government selected Tagalogthe language of Manila and its surrounding provincesas the basis of the national language, although it would be many years before its usage became general. Women&#x27;s suffrage was adopted, and the economy recovered to its pre-Depression level before the Japanese occupation in 1942. A period of exile took place during World War II from 1942 to 1945, when Japan occupied the Commonwealth.

On July 4, 1946, the Commonwealth ended, and the Philippines attained full sovereignty as provided for in Article XVIII of the 1935 Constitution.

== Etymology ==
The Commonwealth of the Philippines was also known as the &quot;Philippine Commonwealth&quot;, or simply as &quot;the Commonwealth&quot;. Its official name in Spanish, the other of the Commonwealth&#x27;s two official languages, was (). The 1935 Constitution uses &quot;the Philippines&quot; as the country&#x27;s short-form name throughout its provisions and uses &quot;the Philippine Islands&quot; only to refer to pre-1935 status and institutions. Under the Insular Government (1901–1935), both terms were used officially. In 1937, Tagalog was declared to be the basis of a national language, effective after two years. The country&#x27;s official name translated into Tagalog would be ().

== History ==
=== Creation ===

The pre-1935 U.S. territorial administration, or Insular Government, was headed by a governor general who was appointed by the president of the United States. In December 1932, the United States Congress passed the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act with the premise of granting Filipinos independence. Provisions of the law included reserving several military and naval bases for the United States as well as imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports. When it reached him for a possible signature, President Herbert Hoover vetoed the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act, but the American Congress overrode Hoover&#x27;s veto in 1933 and passed the law over Hoover&#x27;s objections. The bill, however, was opposed by then-Philippine Senate President Manuel L. Quezon and was also rejected by the Philippine Senate.

This led to the creation and passing of the Tydings–McDuffie Act or the Philippine Independence Act, which allowed the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines with a ten-year period of peaceful transition to full independence – the date of which was to be on the 4th of July following the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Commonwealth.

A Constitutional Convention was convened in Manila on July 30, 1934. On February 8, 1935, the 1935 Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippines was approved by the convention by a vote of 177 to 1. The constitution was approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 25, 1935, and ratified by popular vote on May 14, 1935.

On September 16, 1935, presidential elections were held. Candidates included former president Emilio Aguinaldo, Philippine Independent Church leader Gregorio Aglipay, and others. Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osmeña of the Nacionalista Party were proclaimed the winners, winning the seats of president and vice-president, respectively.

The Commonwealth government was inaugurated on the morning of November 15, 1935, in ceremonies held on the steps of the Legislative Building in Manila. The event was attended by a crowd of around 300,000 people.

=== Pre-war ===

The new government embarked on ambitious nation-building policies in preparation for economic and political independence. These included national defense (such as the National Defense Act of 1935, which organized a conscription for service in the country), greater control over the economy, the perfection of democratic institutions, reforms in education, the improvement of transportation, the promotion of local capital, and industrialization.

However, uncertainties, especially in the diplomatic and military situation in Southeast Asia, in the level of U.S. commitment to the future Republic of the Philippines, and in the economy due to the Great Depression, proved to be major problems. The situation was further complicated by the presence of agrarian unrest and power struggles between Osmeña and Quezon, especially after Quezon was permitted to be re-elected after one six-year term.

A proper evaluation of the policies&#x27; effectiveness or failure is difficult due to the Japanese invasion and occupation during World War II.

=== World War II ===

Japan launched a surprise attack on the Philippines on December 8, 1941. The Commonwealth government drafted the Philippine Army into the U.S. Army Forces Far East, which would resist Japanese occupation. Manila was declared an open city to prevent its destruction, and it was occupied by the Japanese on January 2, 1942. Meanwhile, battles against the Japanese continued on the Bataan Peninsula, Corregidor, and Leyte until the final surrender of United States-Philippine forces in May 1942.
Quezon and Osmeña were escorted by troops from Manila to Corregidor and later left for Australia prior to going to the U.S., where they set up a government in exile, based at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. This government participated in the Pacific War Council as well as the Declaration by United Nations. Quezon became ill with tuberculosis and died from it, with Osmeña succeeding him as president.

The main general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army (PCA), located on the military station in Ermita, Manila, was closed down on December 24, 1941. It was taken over by the Japanese Imperial Forces when they occupied the city on January 2, 1942. Elsewhere in the country, other military posts of the PCA in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao engaged in military action against the Japanese.

Meanwhile, the Japanese military organized a new government in the Philippines known as the Second Philippine Republic, headed by President Jose P. Laurel. This pro-Japanese government became very unpopular.

Resistance to the Japanese occupation continued in the Philippines. This included the &quot;Hukbalahap&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Army Against the Japanese&quot;), which consisted of 30,000 armed men and controlled much of Central Luzon; they attacked both the Japanese and other non-Huk guerrillas. Remnants of the Philippine Army, as well as unsurrendered Americans, also successfully fought the Japanese through guerrilla warfare. These efforts eventually liberated all but 12 of the 48 provinces.

General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s army landed on Leyte on October 20, 1944, as did the Philippine Commonwealth troops who arrived in other amphibious landings. The Philippine Constabulary was placed on active service with the Philippine Commonwealth Army and re-established from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, during the Allied liberation and the post–World War II era. Fighting continued in remote corners of the Philippines until Japan&#x27;s surrender in August 1945, which was signed on September 2 in Tokyo Bay. Estimates of Filipino war dead reached one million, and Manila was extensively damaged when Japanese marines refused to vacate the city when ordered to do so by the Japanese High Command. After the war in the Philippines, the Commonwealth was restored, and a one-year transitional period in preparation for independence began. Elections followed in April 1946, with Manuel Roxas winning as the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines and Elpidio Quirino winning as vice president.

=== Independence of the Philippines ===

The Commonwealth ended when the U.S. recognized Philippine independence on July 4, 1946, as scheduled. However, the economy remained dependent on the U.S. This was due to the Bell Trade Act, otherwise known as the Philippine Trade Act, which was a precondition for receiving war rehabilitation grants from the United States.

== Policies ==

=== Uprisings and agrarian reform ===
During the Commonwealth period, tenant farmers held grievances often rooted to debt caused by the sharecropping system, as well as by the dramatic increase in population, which added economic pressure to the tenant farmers&#x27; families. As a result, an agrarian reform program was initiated by the Commonwealth. However, success of the program was hampered by ongoing clashes between tenants and landowners.

An example of these clashes includes one initiated by Benigno Ramos through his &quot;Sakdalista&quot; movement, which advocated tax reductions, land reforms, the breakup of the large estates or &quot;haciendas&quot;, and the severing of American ties. The uprising, which occurred in Central Luzon in May 1935, claimed about a hundred lives.

=== National language ===
As per the 1935 constitution, the commonwealth had two official languages: English and Spanish. Due to the diverse number of Philippine languages, a provision calling for the &quot;development and adoption of a common national language based on the existing native dialects&quot; was drafted into the 1935 constitution. In 1936, the national assembly enacted Commonwealth Act No. 184, creating the &quot;Surián ng Wikang Pambansà&quot; (National Language Institute). This body was initially composed of President Quezon and six other members from various ethnic groups. In 1937, after deliberations, the body selected Tagalog as the basis for the national language. This was made official on December 30, 1937, in an executive order which became effective two years after issuance.

In 1940, the government authorized the creation of a dictionary and grammar book for the language. In that same year, Commonwealth Act 570 was passed, allowing Filipino to become an official language upon independence.

== Economy ==
The cash economy of the Commonwealth was mostly agriculture-based. Products included abaca, coconuts and coconut oil, sugar, and timber. Numerous other crops and livestock were grown for local consumption by the Filipino people. Other sources for foreign income included the spin-off from money spent at American military bases on the Philippines such as the naval base at Subic Bay and Clark Air Base (with U.S. Army airplanes there as early as 1919), both on the island of Luzon.

The performance of the economy was initially good despite challenges from various agrarian uprisings. Taxes collected from a robust coconut industry helped boost the economy by funding infrastructure and other development projects. However, growth was halted due to the outbreak of World War II.

== Demographics ==
In 1939, a census of the Philippines was taken and determined that it had a population of 16,000,303; of these 15.7 million were counted as &quot;Brown&quot;, 141.8 thousand as &quot;Yellow&quot;, 50.5 thousand as &quot;Mixed&quot;, 29.1 thousand as &quot;Negro&quot;, 19.3 thousand as &quot;White&quot;, and under 1 thousand &quot;Other&quot;. In 1941, the estimated population of the Philippines reached 17,000,000; there were 117,000 Chinese, 30,000 Japanese, and 9,000 Americans. English was spoken by 26.3% of the population, according to the 1939 Census. Spanish, after English overtook it beginning in the 1920s, became a language for the elite and in government; it was later banned during the Japanese occupation.

Estimated numbers of speakers of the dominant languages:
*Cebuano: 4,620,685
*Tagalog: 3,068,565
*Ilocano: 2,353,518
*Hiligaynon: 1,951,005
*Waray: 920,009
*Kapampangan: 621,455
*Pangasinan: 573,752

== Government ==
The Commonwealth had its own constitution, which remained effective after independence until 1973, and was self-governing although foreign policy and military affairs would be under the responsibility of the United States, and Laws passed by the legislature affecting immigration, foreign trade, and the currency system had to be approved by the United States president. Despite maintaining ultimate sovereignty, in some ways the US Government treated the Commonwealth as a sovereign state, and the Philippines sometimes acted in a state capacity in international relations.

During the 1935–41 period, the Commonwealth of the Philippines featured a very strong executive, a unicameral National Assembly, and a Supreme Court, all composed entirely of Filipinos, as well as an elected Resident Commissioner to the United States House of Representatives (as Puerto Rico does today). An American High Commissioner and an American Military Advisor, Douglas MacArthur headed the latter office from 1937 until the advent of World War II in 1941, holding the military rank of Field Marshal of the Philippines. After 1946, the rank of field marshal disappeared from the Philippine military.

During 1939 and 1940, after an amendment in the Commonwealth&#x27;s Constitution, a bicameral Congress, consisting of a Senate, and of a House of Representatives, was restored, replacing the National Assembly.

=== Quezon administration (1935–1944) ===
In 1935 Quezon won the Philippines&#x27; first national presidential election under the banner of the Nacionalista Party. He obtained nearly 68% of the vote against his two main rivals, Emilio Aguinaldo and Bishop Gregorio Aglipay. Quezon was inaugurated on November 15, 1935. He is recognized as the second President of the Philippines. When Manuel L. Quezon was inaugurated President of the Philippines in 1935, he became the first Filipino to head a government of the Philippines since Emilio Aguinaldo and the Malolos Republic in 1898. However, in January 2008, Congressman Rodolfo Valencia of Oriental Mindoro filed a bill seeking instead to declare General Miguel Malvar as the second Philippine President, who took control over all Filipino forces after American soldiers captured President Emilio Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela on March 23, 1901.

Quezon had originally been barred by the Philippine constitution from seeking re-election. However, in 1940, constitutional amendments were ratified allowing him to seek re-election for a fresh term ending in 1943. In the 1941 presidential elections, Quezon was re-elected over former Senator Juan Sumulong with nearly 82% of the vote.

In a notable humanitarian act, Quezon, in cooperation with U.S. High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt, facilitated the entry into the Philippines of Jewish refugees fleeing fascist regimes in Europe. Quezon was also instrumental in promoting a project to resettle the refugees in Mindanao.
The Japanese invasion of the Philippines began with an invasion of Batan Island on December 8, 1941. When advancing Japanese forces threatened Manila, President Quezon, other senior officials of the Commonwealth government, and senior American military commanders relocated to Corregidor island, and Manila was declared an open city. On February 20, Quezon, his family, and senior officials of the Commonwealth government were evacuated from the island by submarine on the first leg of what came to be a relocation of the Commonwealth government in exile to the U.S.

Quezon suffered from tuberculosis and spent his last years in a &quot;cure cottage&quot; in Saranac Lake, NY, where he died on August 1, 1944. He was initially buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His body was later carried by the and re-interred in Manila at the Manila North Cemetery in 1979, his remains were moved to Quezon City within the monument at the Quezon Memorial Circle.
=== Osmeña administration (1944–1946) ===

Osmeña became president of the Commonwealth on Quezon&#x27;s death in 1944. He returned to the Philippines the same year with General Douglas MacArthur and the liberation forces. After the war Osmeña restored the Commonwealth government and the various executive departments. He continued the fight for Philippine independence.

For the presidential election of 1946 Osmeña refused to campaign, saying that the Filipino people knew of his record of 40 years of honest and faithful service. Nevertheless, he was defeated by Manuel Roxas, who won 54% of the vote and became the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines.

=== Roxas administration (May 28, 1946 – July 4, 1946) ===

Roxas served as the President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in a brief period, from his subsequent election on May 28, 1946, to July 4, 1946, the scheduled date of the proclamation of Philippine Independence. Roxas prepared the groundwork for the advent of a free and independent Philippines, assisted by the Congress (reorganized May 25, 1946), with Senator José Avelino as the Senate President and Congressman Eugenio Pérez as the House of Representatives Speaker. On June 3, 1946, Roxas appeared for the first time before the joint session of the Congress to deliver his first state of the nation address. Among other things, he told the members of the Congress the grave problems and difficulties the Philippines were set to face and reported on his special trip to the U.S. – the approval for independence.

On June 21, he reappeared in another joint session of the Congress and urged the acceptance of two important laws passed by the U.S. Congress on April 30, 1946, regarding the Philippine lands. They are the Philippine Rehabilitation Act and the Philippine Trade Act. Both recommendations were accepted by the Congress.

<text>Dame Sibyl Mary Hathaway (&#x27;Collings, formerlyBeaumont; 13 January 1884 – 14 July 1974) was Dame of Sark from 1927 until her death in 1974. Her 47-year rule over Sark, in the Channel Islands, spanned the reigns of four monarchs: George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II.

The Dame was the daughter of the eccentric Seigneur of Sark, William Frederick Collings. Sibyl learned French, Sercquiais, Norman and German prior to becoming feudal lady of Sark. She married Dudley Beaumont in 1901, and they had seven children. One of her children died in infancy, and her husband died from Spanish flu in 1918, leaving her a financially troubled widow. She succeeded her father in 1927, and immediately set about reinforcing her feudal rights and promoting tourism on the island, which she affectionately called &quot;the last bastion of feudalism&quot;. When she remarried in 1929, her second husband, Robert Hathaway, legally became her senior co-ruler, but she kept control of the government.

Dame Sibyl&#x27;s tenure saw the German occupation of the Channel Islands in the Second World War, during which she refused to evacuate and convinced the islanders to stay as well. Her eldest son and heir apparent, Francis William Beaumont, was killed in 1941, while her husband was deported to an internment camp in 1943. The Dame remains best known for her indomitable conduct during the occupation. After the war, she continued her publicity campaign, strengthening the island&#x27;s tourism industry.

Having been widowed again in 1954, she went on to rule alone, and was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1965. She was described by a British government official as a &quot;lady of unusual personality&quot;, and is often referred to as a benevolent dictator. Dame Sibyl died at the age of 90, and was succeeded by her grandson, Michael Beaumont.

==Early life==
Sibyl Mary Collings was born in Guernsey in a house that once belonged to John Allaire, her privateering great-great-grandfather, whose business dealings brought the fief of Sark to his daughter, Marie Collings. Her parents were William Frederick Collings and his Montreal-born wife Sophie (&quot;née&quot; Moffatt). Collings was born two years after her notoriously intemperate father inherited the fief from his father, William Thomas Collings. She had one sibling, a sister named Doris.

Collings, heir presumptive to Sark, was treated by her father as if she were a boy. She was lame due to unequal leg length, but that did not prevent him from insisting on teaching her to shoot, sail, and climb cliffs. He never allowed his daughters to complain of pain or sadness, and his successor was later grateful for &quot;being able to live a life free of the inconvenience of self-pity&quot;. As the future ruler of an island situated between France and the United Kingdom, she learned standard French and the local Sercquiais dialect of the Norman language.

== First marriage ==
At the age of 15, Sybil fell in love with Dudley Beaumont, a British painter who could neither shoot nor climb cliffs, and who her father therefore considered a &quot;weakling&quot;. Her father made it clear that he was adamantly opposed to the relationship, but Sibyl continued to see Beaumont. By 1901, after a raging argument, her father dragged Sybil out of her bedroom at midnight and threw her out of the seigneurial residence barefoot and in a nightgown. Sybil remained among the hedges of the garden until Beaumont, alerted by her mother (in an age before the telephone), found her before dawn. Her father regretted his action almost immediately, and searched the island for her the next morning, but she had resolved to leave. She boarded a boat for the neighbouring island of Guernsey. When the Seigneur stormed aboard looking for her, she was hidden by the captain. From Guernsey, she travelled to the house of a relative in London. Beaumont soon married her at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly.

Sibyl Beaumont had no contact with her father for the next one year, until the birth of her first child, Bridget (1902–1948). Wanting to be reconciled with his daughter, her father sent her a telegram of congratulation which contained words of consolation as well, as the child was female: &quot;Sorry it was a vixen&quot;. Sybil went on to have six children more: four sons – Francis William Lionel, Cyril John Astley, Basil Ian (died in infancy) and Richard Vyvyan Dudley, and two more daughters – Douce Alianore Daphne and Jehanne Rosemary Ernestine (born posthumously). The family moved to Sark in 1912, a few years after her mother&#x27;s death.

In her 1961 autobiography, Sybil wrote extensively about her relationship with her first husband. Dudley Beaumont, who served in the British Army as an officer during the First World War, died on 24 November 1918 during the Spanish flu pandemic. His death left her a pregnant widow with precarious finances. Neither her father nor her father-in-law, the army officer William Spencer Beaumont, were willing to give financial support to the widow and her six surviving children. She learned German and started working for the YMCA in Cologne. She also worked for the British Army of the Rhine and raised prize cattle.

== Accession and remarriage ==

William Frederick Collings died on 20 June 1927, and was succeeded by his widowed daughter. Towards the end of his life, he stopped requesting from the inhabitants the payment of tithes, wheat and &quot;poulage&quot; (a feudal tax of two chickens). Upon her accession, the new dame immediately reasserted her feudal rights, and even noted: &quot;They always give me the skinniest and oldest [chickens]&quot;.

Some islanders complained about Sark being the last remnant of feudalism in Europe, but the Dame maintained that agriculture had to be encouraged to make the island more self-sufficient. She used the island&#x27;s unique feudal system to draw tourists, and refused to allow anything to deter them by ruining its peacefulness. She thus banned motor vehicles and holiday camps, but the Chief Pleas refused to pass an ordinance that would forbid selling alcohol to anyone known to get drunk. Like her eldest son Francis, heir apparent to the seigneurship, she was fascinated by film production. While &quot;Appointment with Venus&quot; was being shot on Sark in 1951, the Dame even deigned to allow a car ashore, ostensibly believing that &quot;a Land Rover was some sort of senior Boy Scout&quot;.

In autumn 1929, the Dame was on her way to a holiday in the United States when she met Robert Hathaway, an American-born former army aviator. On 5 November, following her return from the United States and a twelve-day-long courtship, they married at St Marylebone Parish Church. Robert was not aware that the marriage made him &quot;jure uxoris&quot; seigneur of Sark, his wife&#x27;s co-ruler, until they set foot on the island. Hathaway&#x27;s strong personality, however, ensured that she had the final say in the matters of government; while her husband attended government meetings as seigneur, she accompanied him to &quot;give advice&quot;. Lecture tours in the United States, aided by her second husband&#x27;s connections, were part of her efforts to promote tourism and bring more revenue to the island.

== Second World War ==
Hathaway&#x27;s tenure as seigneur was interrupted by the German occupation of the Channel Islands in the Second World War from 3 July 1940 until 8 May 1945. While some inhabitants of other Channel Islands were evacuated, Hathaway declared that she would not leave her island, and prevailed upon all native-born islanders to remain as well. 

Most of her tenants bitterly resented her for the decision to remain on Sark during the ensuing five years of occupation, but thanked her after the war when they saw how total evacuation destroyed the neighbouring island of Alderney. The Dame had her senior official meet German officers at the harbour and escort them to her residence, where her maid announced them as if they were guests.
Hathaway was much respected by the islanders as well as by the Germans, whose language she spoke perfectly, for the leadership she gave during this period, and the British Home Secretary Herbert Morrison observed that she remained &quot;almost wholly mistress of the situation&quot; throughout the occupation. Hathaway was on friendly terms with , the German commander stationed in Guernsey, as indicated by their warm correspondence. 

Many other German officers in charge of the Channel Islands were also of noble extraction, and Hathaway exploited their &quot;stiff German formality&quot; by making it clear that she &quot;expected to be treated ... with the rigid etiquette to which they were accustomed in their own country.&quot; She insisted that officers come to her rather than the other way around, and expected them to bow, kiss her hand, and bow again before she allowed them to take a seat. Using her influence with the Prince of Oettingen-Wallerstein, she was able to get the German army physician stationed in Sark to treat her sick tenants. When Germans ordered that all the Sarkese be instructed in German, the Dame offered a room in her residence as a classroom for the children of the island.

Hathaway&#x27;s eldest son Francis and his second wife, the screen actress Mary Lawson, were killed during the Liverpool Blitz; his son Michael became first in line to inherit the island. Her husband was deported to Ilag VII in Laufen in Bavaria in February 1943, where he remained for the rest of the war. He did not sign any document delegating his seigneurial authority, which meant that legality of ordinances issued by Hathaway during this period was, at best, questionable. She refused to sign orders issued by Germans, arguing that they were simply not hers to sign. She was insulted by an order that prohibited sexual relations between her tenants and German troops on the grounds of venereal disease outbreak, since the order implied that Sarkese women consorted with Germans.

According to British historian David Fraser, Sibyl did not raise her objection to a series of antisemitic orders that had been previously issued by the German authorities, which concerned among others her Czech Jewish friend Annie Wranowsky.

Islanders suffered shortage of food in the last months of the occupation. Hathaway organised a raid on German grain stocks and saved many families from starvation with her secret potato hoard. Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945. Three British officers arrived and, explaining that no British troops were available, asked the Dame to take command of 275 men belonging to the defeated German garrison. She made sure the garrison cleared up the island of land mines. She was, however, so concerned about the legal status of the decisions she had issued during the war that she sailed to Guernsey to validate them as soon as the island was liberated. Her experience of the German occupation inspired William Douglas-Home&#x27;s play &quot;The Dame of Sark&quot;. Hathaway&#x27;s manner of receiving Germans has been described as both impressive and overly cordial. She felt there was nothing to be gained by being rude to them.

== Postwar years ==

Following the war, Hathaway continued to promote Sark&#x27;s tourist trade and advocated building a new harbour. In 1949, she and her husband welcomed Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II) and the Duke of Edinburgh, who opened the new harbour. The same year, Hathaway became Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

Sibyl and Robert Hathaway&#x27;s happy marriage ended with his death in 1954, six years after the death of her eldest child, Bridget. Hathaway, a widow once again, regained her complete authority over the island. In 1957, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh returned to Sark; this was the first time a reigning monarch had ever come to the island.

Hathaway rendered homage to the Queen on that occasion – the first time that ceremony was performed on Sark itself. Her autobiography, &quot;Dame of Sark&quot;, was published in 1961.

On the 400th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s grant of charter signed in 1565 to Sark&#x27;s first seigneur, Hellier de Carteret, Hathaway was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire at Buckingham Palace. She then jokingly referred to herself as a &quot;double dame&quot;. However, soon after her quatercentenary, her daughter, Douce Briscoe, died in 1967, having struggled with alcoholism for a long time.

In 1969, Hathaway became increasingly worried by the Royal Commission on the Constitution&#x27;s intrusion into her affairs. At the same time, she had a sharp dispute with the Chief Pleas, claiming that its members violated the laws they themselves had passed and that their misconduct threatened to make her tourism campaign futile. She shocked the islanders by announcing her intention to resign the charter of the island back to the Crown &quot;in somewhat the same way as the Hereditary le Mesurier Family did in Alderney&quot; and to recommend that the government be taken over by Guernsey. The threat was effective; regulations were suddenly enforced much more strictly. By the beginning of the next year, Hathaway retracted her announcement, having been persuaded &quot;by an enormous number of letters and requests&quot;.

==Death==
Cyril Beaumont died in 1973, becoming the fifth child Dame Sibyl outlived. Early next year, the 90-year-old gave her approval for the stage presentation of William Douglas-Home&#x27;s play &quot;The Dame of Sark&quot;, inspired by her experiences in the Second World War. She looked forward to meeting Celia Johnson, who was to play the title role, but died suddenly at the Seigneurie of a heart attack on 14 July 1974. The play was later adapted as a television film in 1976, with Johnson in the title role.

The seigneurship passed from the benevolent dictator, referred to as a &quot;lady of unusual personality&quot; by a British government official, to her grandson Michael Beaumont. Sark remained &quot;the last bastion of feudalism&quot;, as she proudly put it, until 2008, when universal suffrage and a democratic leadership were established.

<text>Oberleutnant Stefan Herdt, also known as Heinz Herdt, was German Representative in Sark from 4 July 1940 to October 1942, and commander of the German garrison.

Born in 1915, he was trained as a teacher before being called up in 1939. Selected for officer training, he served in Poland and Belgium before coming to the Channel Islands, as commander of Company 6 Infantry Regiment 583.

He took office the day after the German occupation, deposing Sibyl Hathaway as the most senior authority in the island with the title &quot;Inselkommandant Sark&quot;.

During his tenure, Operation Basalt took place, in which three prisoners were killed by British commandos, in one case because the prisoner began shouting to alert nearby German soldiers, and in the other cases the prisoners were killed while attempting to escape during an attack by German forces. Nazi propaganda obscured the details of the event and portrayed it as the execution of prisoners. Herdt was replaced as commander in Sark and reportedly Herdt was to face a court martial but for the reaction by Hitler to the deaths. The raid prompted Hitler to issue an order calling for all British commandos to be summarily executed.

Herdt returned as commander in Sark after the death of Johann Hinkel in March 1943.

<text>William Frederick Collings (1852 – 20 June 1927) was seigneur of Sark from 1882 until his death. One of the most eccentric lords of the island, he was known for his anti-clericalism, stubbornness, intemperance and generosity.

== Youth ==

Collings was the elder son and one of six children of William Thomas Collings, Seigneur of Sark, and the lichenologist Louisa Collings (née Lukis). An exceptionally tall and well-built blue-eyed man, he was the exact opposite of his father. The two never got along with each other. Collings refused to follow his father into the Church and Trinity College, Cambridge. The compromise was a Grand Tour.

== Seigneurship ==
Collings inherited his father&#x27;s fief on the latter&#x27;s death in 1882, but none of his father&#x27;s interest in military matters. Less than five years after his accession, the Royal Sark Militia, once cherished by his parents, deteriorated into what a visiting journalist described as &quot;seven dozen pairs of boots&quot;. By 1900, he had neglected it enough for it to completely disappear. He refused to spend money on maintenance of his fief, but was the first seigneur to be sufficiently fond of it to reside there permanently. In 1899, he refused to sell the island for an enormous amount of money to a man who intended to open a casino there.

The Sarkese admired Collings for his skill in sailing, shooting, and rock climbing, and he enjoyed their strong support. However, he was &quot;a violent terror when he had taken drink&quot;, according to an islander. The alcoholism caused him to attack the vicar&#x27;s wife with his stick, write anticlerical messages on walls, insult the constable, break window panes and ride into private gardens. He once appeared before the Sénéschal for threatening to shoot a journalist. Collings&#x27; bitter enemy on the island was the French-born vicar, who often displayed his animosity towards the British by omitting prayers for Queen Victoria and her family, to which the Seigneur responded by stamping out of the church and protesting to the vicar&#x27;s superiors.

== Family life ==

Collings was devoted to his wife Sophie (née Moffatt), with whom he had two daughters, Sibyl and Doris. As he had no sons, his elder daughter Sibyl was his heiress presumptive. He raised her as a boy and, despite her lameness caused by unequal leg length, taught her to shoot, sail, and climb cliffs. Nevertheless, whenever they came into conflict, he called her a &quot;damned virago&quot;. He never allowed either Doris or the physically disabled Sibyl to complain of pain or sadness, explaining that &quot;they would be a lot worse off&quot; when they grew old; Sibyl later expressed gratitude to her father for &quot;being able to live a life free of the inconvenience of self-pity&quot;.

The seigneur strongly disapproved of his heiress presumptive&#x27;s relationship with the painter Dudley Beaumont, considering him a &quot;weakling&quot; because he did not shoot or climb cliffs. When he learned that she had continued seeing him, he threw her out from La Seigneurie in a nightdress. Despite his attempts to find her the next morning, she went to London and married Beaumont. For the first time since her marriage, Collings contacted her when she had her first child, a daughter named Bridget. Wishing to send a conciliatory telegram, he consoled her for giving birth to a daughter by writing: &quot;Sorry it was a vixen.&quot; In April 1906, the seigneur and his wife survived a shipwreck, but it worsened her existing illness, leading to her death a few months later.

== Old age and death ==
Collings paid homage to King George V during his and Queen Mary&#x27;s visit to Guernsey in 1921, becoming the first seigneur of Sark to do so in person since Sir Philip Carteret rendered homage to King Charles II on Jersey in 1650. In his old age, the Seigneur became lenient and stopped requesting the inhabitants to pay him &quot;disme&quot;. His widowed daughter succeeded him when he died on 20 June 1927, and quickly restored the seigneurial rights. She described her father as &quot;extremely insubordinate, madly obstinate, fiercely self-opinionated and prone to outbreaks of uncontrolled rage,&quot; but noted that he was a &quot;generous man&quot; and &quot;never hard on those who found difficulty in paying their rents or dues&quot;.

<text>William Thomas Collings (4 September 1823 – 7 March 1882) was a clergyman of the Church of England who served as Seigneur of Sark from 1853 to 1882.

== Ecclesiastical career ==

Collings was the son of Marie and Thomas Guerin Collings (1786–1832). His maternal grandfather, the Guernsey privateer John Allaire, was mortgaged the fief of Sark by the island&#x27;s seigneur, Ernest le Pelley, in 1844. By 1852, both the Seigneur and Collings&#x27; grandfather were dead. The Seigneur&#x27;s successor, Pierre Carey le Pelley, was unable to pay the mortgage and thus had to sell Sark to Marie Collings, Allaire&#x27;s heiress. Collings was ordained a deacon of the Church of England the same year at the Wells Cathedral, where he served as curate prior to being ordained as a priest the following year. The Guernsey historian James Marr denies that he ever became canon of the Wells Cathedral, calling it a &quot;frequently repeated but entirely false assertion&quot;.

== Seigneurship ==

Collings&#x27; mother died only a year after becoming ruler of Sark, and he inherited the fief. Much like the Le Pelleys had done when they purchased the fief a century earlier, Collings used the family fortune–acquired by privateering–to expand and renovate his residence, La Seigneurie. Like his predecessor, he bought the neighbouring tenement and thus gained third vote in the Chief Pleas.

As seigneur, Collings was keen on improving the welfare of the community. He improved schooling and encouraged the construction of small hotels, seeking to encourage the newly developed industry of tourism. His priority was to provide for the defence of the island, whose militia he was very proud of. Collings was determined to make up for the years of his predecessors&#x27; seigneurial neglect, and he used his personal resources for that end. In 1855, in keeping with his ecclesiastical background, Collings gave land to the church for a new cemetery and, striving to discourage vice, had a prison constructed on the island. In 1864, he offered a house for the use of Sark&#x27;s schoolmaster on the condition that he was an Anglican, and in doing so greatly offended the numerous Methodists in the Chief Pleas. He was a member of the Photographic Society from 1853–54.

Collings loved Sark but, like the Pelleys, only used it as a summer residence, preferring to spend winters in the neighbouring island of Guernsey. On 28 November 1872, Collings was sailing from Sark to spend the winter on Guernsey when the vessel hit a rock and sank. The Seigneur narrowly escaped drowning, but never recovered his baggage, which contained the original charter of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s 1565 grant of Sark to Helier de Carteret. A copy of the charter remains preserved in the Public Record Office in London.

== Family ==

Collings married his cousin Louisa Lukis, an amateur lichenologist and collector, on 15 June 1847. The ceremony was conducted by her brother, William Collings Lukis, at St Saviour&#x27;s Church. They had four daughters and two sons, William Frederick (1852–1927) and Henry de Vic (1855–1872). William Frederick, the heir apparent, was the exact opposite of his father, and the two never got along. Collings was succeeded by his son upon his death on 7 March 1882. He was outlived by his wife, elder son and eldest daughter, Mary Edmeades.

<text>Marie Collings (née Allaire; 1791–1853), sometimes referred to as Mary Collings, was a wealthy Guernsey heiress who ruled as Dame of Sark (island) from 1852 to 1853, being the island&#x27;s second female ruler and the first holder of the fief from the presently ruling seigneurial family. She inherited the fortune of her father, the privateer John Allaire, who had obtained the mortgage on the fief shortly before his death. The island&#x27;s then-ruling seigneur, Pierre Carey le Pelley, soon had no option but to sell the fief to Collings, but she never actively governed it.

== Background ==

Collings was born into a wealthy family from Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands. She was one of the two daughters of the privateer John Allaire (1762–1846), the other one being Catherine Allaire. Her father was reputedly the most affluent man in Guernsey, whose fortune appears to have stemmed not only from privateering during the Napoleonic Wars, but also from outright piracy. She was married to Thomas Guérin Collings, Constable of the Town and Parish of Saint Peter Port. The couple had a son, William Thomas Collings (1823–1882), and several daughters. Collings&#x27; husband died in 1832.

== Mortgage ==
On 24 February 1844, desperate for funds to continue the operation of the silver mine on the island, the then-Seigneur of Sark Ernest le Pelley obtained crown permission to mortgage the fief of Sark for £4,000 to Collings&#x27; father. The latter died within two years, leaving his wealth to his daughters. The mortgage and the tenement of the island of Jethou passed to Collings. The mine closed in 1847, two years after the uninsured collapse of its deepest gallery, and when Ernest le Pelley died in 1849 his successor, Pierre Carey le Pelley, was unable to keep up his mortgage payments to Collings. She then decided to foreclose the mortgage, forcing him to seek Queen Victoria&#x27;s permission to sell the seigneurie of Sark on 10 November 1852. The widowed Marie Collings bought it on 4 December for £6,000 less the sum borrowed and an accumulated interest of £616.13s, for a total of £1,383.

== Seigneurship ==

By the time she became Dame of Sark, she was already too old to actively participate in the government of the island. She never visited it during her tenure, &quot;to the regret of the Sark people&quot;. La Seigneurie, official residence of the ruler of Sark, was modernised and extended during Collings&#x27; brief rule, just like it was in the 1730s, when another widow, Susanne le Pelley, bought the fief. Collings meanwhile resided in Guernsey, and was represented in Sark by her only son and heir apparent, the Anglican priest William Thomas Collings. He succeeded her as seigneur of Sark upon her death in 1853, less than a year after the purchase. She was also survived by a daughter, Catherine Ann Allaire Ozanne (1826–1879). The island remains in Collings&#x27; family through the children of William Thomas and Louisa Collings. Her descendant Christopher Beaumont is the current seigneur.

<text>Vorticism was a London-based modernist art movement formed in 1914 by the writer and artist Wyndham Lewis. The movement was partially inspired by Cubism and was introduced to the public by means of the publication of the Vorticist manifesto in &quot;Blast&quot; magazine. Familiar forms of representational art were rejected in favour of a geometric style that tended towards a hard-edged abstraction. Lewis proved unable to harness the talents of his disparate group of avant-garde artists; however, for a brief period Vorticism proved to be an exciting intervention and an artistic riposte to Marinetti&#x27;s Futurism and the Post-Impressionism of Roger Fry&#x27;s Omega Workshops.

Vorticist paintings emphasised &#x27;modern life&#x27; as an array of bold lines and harsh colours drawing the viewer&#x27;s eye into the centre of the canvas and vorticist sculpture created energy and intensity through &#x27;direct carving&#x27;.

== Prelude to Vorticism ==

In the summer of 1913 Roger Fry, with Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell, set up the Omega Workshops in Fitzrovia – in the heart of bohemian London. Fry was an advocate of an increasingly abstract art and design practice, and the studio/gallery/retail outlet allowed him to employ and support artists in sympathy with this approach, such as Wyndham Lewis, Frederick Etchells, Cuthbert Hamilton and Edward Wadsworth. Lewis had made an impact at the Allied Artists&#x27; Salon the previous year with a huge virtually abstract work, &quot;Kermesse&quot; (now lost), and in the same year he had worked with the American sculptor Jacob Epstein on the decoration of Madame Strindberg&#x27;s notorious cabaret theatre club The Cave of the Golden Calf.

Lewis and his Omega Workshop colleagues Etchells, Hamilton and Wadsworth exhibited together later in the year at Brighton with Epstein and David Bomberg. Lewis curated the exhibition&#x27;s &#x27;Cubist Room&#x27; and provided a written introduction in which he attempted to cohere the various strands of abstraction on display: &#x27;These painters are not associated here, but form a vertiginous, but not exotic, island in the placid and respectable archipelago of English Art.&#x27;

== Rebel artists ==

A quarrel with Roger Fry provided Lewis with a pretext to leave the Omega Workshops and set up a rival organisation. Financed by Lewis&#x27;s painter friend Kate Lechmere, the Rebel Art Centre was established in March 1914 at 38 Great Ormond Street. It was to be a platform for the art and ideas of Lewis&#x27;s circle, and a lecture series included talks by Lewis&#x27;s friend the poet Ezra Pound, the novelist Ford Madox Hueffer (later Ford Madox Ford) and the Italian &#x27;Futurist&#x27;, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Marinetti had been a familiar – and provocative – presence in London since 1910, and Lewis had seen him create an art movement on the basis of his &#x27;Futurist&#x27; manifesto. It seemed as if everything novel or shocking in London was now being described as &#x27;Futurist&#x27; – including the work of the English Cubists.

When Marinetti and the English Futurist C. R. W. Nevinson published a manifesto of &#x27;Vital English Art&#x27;, giving the Rebel Art Centre as an address, it seemed like an attempted takeover. A few weeks later, Lewis took out an advertisement in &quot;The Spectator&quot; to announce the publication of &#x27;The Manifesto of the Vorticists&#x27; – an English abstract art movement that was a &#x27;parallel movement to Cubism and Expressionism&#x27; and would, the advertisement promised, be a &#x27;Death Blow to Impressionism and Futurism&#x27;.

== Inventing Vorticism ==
Ezra Pound had introduced the concept of &#x27;the vortex&#x27; in relation to modernist poetry and art early on in 1914. At its most obvious, for example, London could be seen to be a &#x27;vortex&#x27; of intellectual and artistic activity. However, for Pound there was a more specific – if obscure – meaning: &#x27;[The vortex was] that point in the cyclone where energy cuts into space and imparts form to it ... the pattern of angles and geometric lines which is formed by our vortex in the existing chaos.&#x27; Lewis saw the potential of &#x27;Vorticism&#x27; as an exciting rallying call that was also sufficiently vague, he hoped, to embrace the individualism of the rebel artists.

Lewis&#x27;s Vorticist manifesto was to be published in a new literary and art journal, &quot;BLAST&quot; – ironically, the journal&#x27;s title had been suggested by Nevinson, who was now persona non grata since the &#x27;Vital English Art&#x27; manifesto. The French sculptor, painter and anarchist Henri Gaudier-Brzeska had met Ezra Pound in July 1913, and their ideas on &#x27;The New Sculpture&#x27; developed into a theory of Vorticist sculpture. Two artists, Helen Saunders and Jessica Dismorr, who had turned to &#x27;cubist works&#x27; in 1913, joined the rebels – and, although they were not regarded highly by the men, Brigid Peppin argues that Saunders&#x27;s &#x27;juxtapositions of strong and unexpected colour&#x27; may have influenced Lewis&#x27;s later use of forceful colour.

Another up-and-coming &#x27;English Cubist&#x27; using bold, discordant colour combinations was William Roberts. Writing much later, he recalled Lewis borrowing two paintings – &quot;Religion&quot; and &quot;Dancers&quot; – to hang at the Rebel Art Centre.

== &quot;BLAST&quot; ==
Although the Rebel Art Centre was short-lived, &#x27;Vorticism&#x27; was given assured longevity through the dazzling typography and the audacious (and humorous) &#x27;blasting&#x27; and &#x27;blessing&#x27; of myriad sacred cows of English and American culture that appeared in the first issue of &quot;BLAST: The Review of the Great English Vortex&quot;, published in July 1914.

&quot;BLAST&quot; was launched at a &#x27;riotous celebratory dinner&#x27; at the Dieudonné Hotel in the St James&#x27;s area of London on 15 July 1914. The magazine was mainly the work of Lewis, but also included extensive written pieces by Ford Madox Hueffer and Rebecca West, as well as poetry by Pound, articles by Gaudier-Brzeska and Wadsworth, and reproductions of paintings by Lewis, Wadsworth, Etchells, Roberts, Epstein, Gaudier-Brzeska and Hamilton. The manifesto was apparently &#x27;signed&#x27; by eleven signatories. Lewis, Pound and Gaudier-Brzeska were at the intellectual heart of the project, but Roberts&#x27;s later comments suggest that most of the group were not made aware of the manifesto&#x27;s contents before publication. Jacob Epstein was presumably too established to be co-opted as a signatory, and David Bomberg had threatened Lewis with legal action if his work was reproduced in &quot;BLAST&quot; and made his independence very clear through a one-man show at the Chenil Galleries, also in July, where his large abstract painting &quot;Mud Bath&quot; was prominently displayed outside above the entrance.

== Vorticist Exhibition ==

The publication of &quot;BLAST&quot; could not have come at a worse time, as in August 1914 Britain declared war on Germany. There would be little appetite for avant-garde art at this time of national and international crisis; however, a ‘Vorticist Exhibition’ went ahead at the Doré Galleries in New Bond Street the following year. The forty-nine ‘Vorticist’ works by Dismorr, Etchells, Gaudier-Brzeska, Lewis, Roberts, Saunders and Wadsworth showed a commitment to hard-edged, highly coloured, near-abstract work. Perhaps by way of contrast (or comparison), Lewis also invited other artists including Bomberg and Nevinson to participate.

A catalogue foreword by Lewis clarified that ‘by Vorticism we mean (a) ACTIVITY as opposed to the tasteful PASSIVITY of Picasso (b) SIGNIFICANCE as opposed to the dull anecdotal character to which the Naturalist is condemned (c) ESSENTIAL MOVEMENT and ACTIVITY (such as the energy of the mind) as opposed to the imitative cinematography, the fuss and hysterics of the Futurists.’ The exhibition was largely ignored by the press, and the reviews that did appear were damning.

== &quot;BLAST: War Number&quot; ==
Just before the exhibition opening, news reached London of Gaudier-Brzeska&#x27;s death in the trenches in France. A ‘Notice to Public’ in the second number of &quot;BLAST&quot; explained that the publication had been delayed ‘due to the War chiefly’ and to ‘the illness of the Editor at the time it should have appeared and before’, and the delay allowed the last-minute inclusion of a tribute to the artist.

Compared with &quot;BLAST&quot; No. 1 this was a scaled-back production – 102 pages, rather than the 158 pages of the first issue and with simple black-and-white ‘line block’ illustrations. However, compared with &quot;BLAST&quot; No. 1, that did have the advantage of providing ‘a cohesive Vorticist aesthetic’. Jessica Dismorr and Dorothy Shakespear (Ezra Pound&#x27;s wife) joined a slightly broader range of artists that also included Jacob Kramer and Nevinson. Lewis&#x27;s rhetoric was more cautious this time – trying to avoid being seen by the readership as unpatriotic. Understandably, he tried to strike an optimist tone with regard to the future of Vorticism and &quot;BLAST&quot;; however, within a year most of the artists had enlisted or volunteered in the armed forces: Lewis – Royal Garrison Artillery; Roberts – Royal Field Artillery; Wadsworth – British Naval Intelligence; Bomberg – Royal Engineers; Dismorr – Voluntary Air Detachment; and Saunders – government office work.

== Vorticists at the Penguin Club ==

Ezra Pound had been championing Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s work from 1915 with a successful New York lawyer and art collector, John Quinn. Relying on Pound&#x27;s recommendations, a New York Vorticist exhibition was built around forty-six works by Lewis – some already in Quinn&#x27;s collection – with additional work by Etchells, Roberts, Dismorr, Saunders and Wadsworth. The exhibition was to be at an artist-run establishment, the Penguin Club in New York. Pound arranged for the transportation of works across the Atlantic, and Quinn took on the entire exhibition costs. Quinn had already selected works that he was interested in buying, but after the exhibition, as no works had sold, he eventually purchased most of the larger items.

== War artists ==

There was almost no opportunity for the rebel artists to work creatively while on active service. However, Wadsworth, unexpectedly, was able to pursue his artistic interests through the supervision of the dazzle camouflage being applied to over two thousand ships, largely at Bristol and Liverpool.

Towards the end of the war the journalist Paul Konody, now art adviser to the Canadian War Memorials Fund (and someone who had been blatantly anti-Vorticism), commissioned Lewis, Wadsworth, Nevinson, Roberts, Paul Nash and Bomberg to produce monumental canvases on subjects relating to the Canadian war experience for a projected memorial hall in Ottawa. The artists were warned that only &#x27;representative&#x27; work would be acceptable, and indeed Bomberg&#x27;s first version of his &quot;Sappers at Work&quot; was rejected as being &#x27;too cubist&#x27;. Despite these restrictions, the extraordinary canvases feel uncompromisingly modernist, and certainly drew from pre-war avant-garde practices.

== Group X ==

In the post-war years it was difficult for artists to receive patronage and to secure sales. Nevertheless, Lewis, Wadsworth, Roberts and Atkinson all had one-man shows by the early 1920s – each artist navigating his own path between modernism and potentially more saleable recognisable subjects. Lewis organised one more group show, in 1920 at the Mansard Gallery, bringing together ten artists under the banner &#x27;Group X&#x27;. Now, however, there was little attempt to unify the artists&#x27;s contributions beyond Lewis&#x27;s belief that &#x27;the experiments [by artists] undertaken all over Europe during the last ten years should ... not be lightly abandoned.&#x27; The diversity of styles on display, for example, included four self-portraits by Lewis, while Roberts exhibited four quite radical works in his evolving &#x27;Cubist&#x27; style. Six of the Group X artists had been in the &#x27;Vorticist&#x27; group – Dismorr, Etchells, Hamilton, Lewis, Roberts and Wadsworth – and they were joined by the sculptor Frank Dobson (sculptor), the painter Charles Ginner, the American graphic designer Edward McKnight Kauffer, and the painter John Turnbull. The exhibition was mainly seen as a failure to &#x27;rekindle a flame of adventure&#x27;.

== Legacy ==
The disruption of war and the subsequent mobilisation of the artists contributed to a situation whereby many of the larger Vorticist paintings were lost. An anecdote recorded by Brigid Peppin relates how Helen Saunders&#x27;s sister used a Vorticist oil to cover her larder floor and &#x27;[it was] worn to destruction&#x27; – an extreme example of how the paintings were not appreciated. When John Quinn died, in 1927, his collection of Vorticist works was auctioned and dissipated to now untraceable purchasers, presumably in America. Writing in 1974, Richard Cork noted that &#x27;thirty-eight of the forty-nine works displayed by the full members of the movement at the 1915 Vorticist Exhibition are now missing.&#x27;

Despite a resurgence of abstract art in Britain in the middle years of the twentieth century, the contribution of Vorticism was largely forgotten until a spat between John Rothenstein of the Tate Gallery and William Roberts blew up in the press. Rothenstein&#x27;s 1956 Tate Gallery exhibition &#x27;Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism&#x27; was actually a Lewis retrospective with very few Vorticist works. And the inclusion of work by Bomberg, Roberts, Wadsworth, Nevinson, Dobson, Kramer under the heading &#x27;Other Vorticists&#x27; – together with Lewis&#x27;s assertion that &#x27;Vorticism, in fact, was what I, personally, did, and said, at a certain period&#x27; – incensed Roberts as it seemed that he and the others were being set up to be mere disciples of Lewis. The case made by Roberts in the five &#x27;Vorticist Pamphlets&#x27; that he published between 1956 and 1958 was hampered by the absence of key works, but led to other self-published books by Roberts which included early studies of his abstract work. A broader survey was provided by the d&#x27;Offay Couper Gallery&#x27;s &#x27;Abstract Art in England 1913–1914&#x27; exhibition in 1969.

Five years later, the exhibition &#x27;Vorticism and Its Allies&#x27; curated by Richard Cork at the Hayward Gallery, London, went further in painstakingly bringing together paintings, drawings, sculpture (including a reconstruction of Epstein&#x27;s Rock Drill 1913–15), Omega Workshop artefacts, photographs, journals, catalogues, letters and cartoons. Cork also included twenty-five &#x27;Vortographs&#x27; from 1917 by the photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn that had been first displayed at the Camera Club in London in 1918.

== Recent exhibitions ==
More recently, in 2004 in London and Manchester, &#x27;Blasting the Future!: Vorticism in Britain 1910–1920&#x27; explored the links between Vorticism and Futurism, and a major exhibition &#x27;The Vorticists: Manifesto for a Modern World&#x27; in 2010–11 brought Vorticist work to Italy for the first time and to America for the first time since 1917, as well as appearing in London. The curators, Mark Antliff and Vivien Greene, had also traced some previously lost works (such as three paintings by Helen Saunders) that were included in the exhibition.

<doc id="160750" wikidata="Q853630" url="?curid=160750" title="Slasher film">
<text>A slasher film is a subgenre of horror films involving a killer or a group of killers stalking and murdering a group of people, usually by use of bladed or sharp tools. Although the term &quot;slasher&quot; may occasionally be used informally as a generic term for any horror film involving murder, film analysts cite an established set of characteristics which set slasher films apart from other horror subgenres, such as monster movies, splatter films, supernatural and psychological horror films.

Critics cite the Italian &quot;giallo&quot; films and psychological horror films such as &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960) and &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) as early influences. The genre hit its peak between 1978 and 1984 in an era referred to as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of slasher films. Notable slasher films include &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974), &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980), &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984), &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1988), &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997). Many slasher films released decades ago continue to attract cult followings. The slasher canon can be divided into three eras: the classical (1974–1993), the self-referential (1994–2000) and the neoslasher cycle (2000–2013).

==Definition==
Slasher films typically adhere to a specific formula: a past wrongful action causes severe trauma that is reinforced by a commemoration or anniversary that reactivates or re-inspires the killer. Built around stalk-and-murder sequences, the films draw upon the audience&#x27;s feelings of catharsis, recreation, and displacement, as related to sexual pleasure. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s definition notes that, &quot;slasher villains are human beings, or were human beings at some point ... Slasher villains are human killers whose actions are objectively evil, because they’re meant to be bound by human morality. That’s part of the fear that the genre is meant to prey upon, the idea that killers walk among us.&quot; Films with similar structures that have non-human antagonists lacking a conscience, such as &quot;Alien&quot; or &quot;The Terminator&quot;, are not traditionally considered slasher films (though many slasher antagonists are superhuman, have supernatural traits, or possess slightly warped or abstract anthropomorphic forms both physically and metaphysically).

===Common tropes===
The final girl trope is discussed in film studies as being a young woman (occasionally a young man) left alone to face the killer&#x27;s advances in the movie&#x27;s end. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the heroine in &quot;Halloween&quot;, is an example of a typical final girl. Final girls are often, like Laurie Strode, virgins among sexually active teens. Others have called the trope &quot;self-mythologising&quot; based on a handful of especially high-profile examples, asserting that its prominence has been overstated – particularly the innocent, virginal qualities ascribed to putative final girls – and that, in the 21st century, the trope has been filtered through the lens of parody, subversion, and self-aware humour (e.g. &quot;Final Girl&quot;) rather than deployed sincerely.

When slasher films become franchises, they typically take on villain protagonist characteristics, with the series following the continued efforts of their antagonists, rather than any of the killer&#x27;s disposable victims, including any individual entry&#x27;s heroes or final survivor(s) (who, in so far as they continue to appear within the series, are often killed off immediately after their next on-screen appearance, which has become its own trope). Examples of antiheroes around whom the respective series have become centered include Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Chucky and Leatherface. The antagonist is envisioned and embedded into the public psyche as the main and most marketable/recognisable character, even if his screentime is dwarfed in any specific film by the nominal protagonists. The &quot;Scream&quot; film series is a rarity that follows its heroine Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) rather than masked killer Ghostface, whose identity changes from film to film, and is only revealed in each entry&#x27;s finale.

Another alleged trope frequently associated with slasher discourse – and horror more broadly – is that of the &quot;black character(s) dying first&quot; (often formulated as &quot;&quot;always&quot; dying first&quot;). Actual analyses of the films, such as a 2013 investigative piece in Complex, have found that the trope is largely self-mythologising as opposed to being a statistical reality (per Complex, in only 10% of the fifty analysed movies, all containing one or more speaking black characters, did any of them die first).

==Origins==

The appeal of watching people inflict violence upon each other dates back thousands of years to Ancient Rome, though fictionalized accounts became marketable with late 19th century horror plays produced at the Grand Guignol. Maurice Tourneur&#x27;s &quot;The Lunatics&quot; (1912) used visceral violence to attract the Guignol&#x27;s audience. In the United States, public outcry over films like this eventually led to the passage of the Hays Code in 1930. The Hays Code is one of the entertainment industry&#x27;s earliest set of guidelines restricting sexuality and violence deemed unacceptable.

Crime writer Mary Roberts Rinehart influenced horror literature with her novel &quot;The Circular Staircase&quot; (1908), adapted into the silent film &quot;The Bat&quot; (1926), about guests in a remote mansion menaced by a killer in a grotesque mask. Its success led to a series of &quot;old dark house&quot; films including &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1927), based on John Willard&#x27;s 1922 stage play, and Universal Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1932), based on the novel by J.B. Priestley. In both films, the town dwellers are pitted against strange country folk, a recurring theme in later horror films. Along with the &quot;madman on the loose&quot; plotline, these films employed several influences upon the slasher genre, such as lengthy point of view shots and a &quot;sins of the father&quot; catalyst to propel the plot&#x27;s mayhem.

===Early film influences===

George Archainbaud&#x27;s &quot;Thirteen Women&quot; (1932) tells the story of a sorority whose former members are set against one another by a vengeful peer who crosses out their yearbook photos, a device used in subsequent films &quot;Prom Night&quot; (1980) and &quot;Graduation Day&quot; (1981). Early examples include a maniac seeking revenge in &quot;The Terror&quot; (1928), based on the play by Edgar Wallace.

B-movie mogul Val Lewton produced &quot;The Leopard Man&quot; (1943), about a murderer framing his crimes against women on an escaped show leopard. Basil Rathbone&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Claw&quot; (1944) sees Sherlock Holmes investigate murders committed with a five-pronged garden weeder that the killer would raise in the air and bring down on the victim repeatedly, an editing technique that became familiar in the genre. Robert Siodmak&#x27;s &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1946), based on Ethel White&#x27;s novel &quot;Some Must Watch&quot;, stars Ethel Barrymore as a sympathetic woman trying to survive black-gloved killers. &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; also features an early use of jump scares.

British writer Agatha Christie&#x27;s particularly influential 1939 novel &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (adapted in 1945 as &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;), centers on a group of people with secret pasts who are killed one-by-one on an isolated island. Each of the murders mirrors a verse from a nursery rhyme, merging the themes of childhood innocence and vengeful murder. &quot;House of Wax&quot; (1953), &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; (1956), &quot;Screaming Mimi&quot; (1958), &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (1959), and &quot;Cover Girl Killer&quot; (1959) all incorporated Christie&#x27;s literary themes.

===1960s horror-thrillers===

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) used visuals that had been deemed unacceptable by movie studios, including scenes of violence, sexuality, and the shot of a toilet flushing. The film featured an iconic score by Bernard Herrmann that has been frequently imitated in slasher and horror films. That same year, Michael Powell released &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, showing the killer&#x27;s perspective as he murders women to photograph their dying expressions.

&quot;Psycho&quot; was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins garnering universal acclaim for his role as Norman Bates. This notice drew bankable movie stars to horror films. Joan Crawford starred in William Castle&#x27;s &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot; (1964) and in Jim O&#x27;Connolly&#x27;s &quot;Berserk!&quot; (1967), while Albert Finney starred in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1964) (a remake of the 1937 British film) and Peter Cushing starred in &quot;Corruption&quot; (1968).

Hammer Studios, a London-based company, followed &quot;Psycho&quot;&#x27;s success with &quot;Taste of Fear&quot; (1961), &quot;Maniac&quot; (1963), &quot;Paranoiac&quot; (1963), &quot;Nightmare&quot; (1964), &quot;Fanatic&quot; (1965), &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1965), and &quot;Hysteria&quot; (1965). Hammer&#x27;s rival Amicus had Robert Bloch, author of 1959 &quot;Psycho&quot; novel, write the script for &quot;Psychopath&quot; (1968).

Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s debut, &quot;Dementia 13&quot; (1963), takes place in an Irish castle where relatives gather to commemorate a family death but are murdered one by one. William Castle&#x27;s &quot;Homicidal&quot; (1961) features gore in its murder scenes, something both &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Peeping&quot; &quot;Tom&quot; had edited out. Richard Hillard&#x27;s &quot;Violent Midnight&quot; (1963) showed a black-gloved killer&#x27;s point of view as they pull down a branch to watch a victim and also featured a skinny-dipping scene. Crown International&#x27;s &quot;Terrified&quot; (1963) features a masked killer. Spain&#x27;s &quot;The House That Screamed&quot; (1969) features violent murders and preempted later campus-based slashers.

===Splatter, Krimi and giallo films===
Subgenres that influenced slasher films include splatter films, &quot;Krimi&quot; films, and &quot;giallo&quot; films.

Splatter films focus on gratuitous gore. Herschell Gordon Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Blood Feast&quot; (1963) was a hit at drive-in theaters and is often considered the first splatter film. Lewis followed with gory films &quot;Two-Thousand Maniacs!&quot; (1964), &quot;Color Me Blood Red&quot; (1965), &quot;The Gruesome Twosome&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Wizard of Gore&quot; (1970). This grotesque style translated to Andy Milligan&#x27;s &quot;The Ghastly Ones&quot; (1969), &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; (1968), &quot;Night After Night After Night&quot; (1969) as well as &quot;The Haunted House of Horror&quot; (1969).

Post-World War II Germany adapted British writer Edgar Wallace&#x27;s crime novels into a subgenre of their own called &quot;Krimi&quot; films. The &quot;Krimi&quot; films were released in the late 1950s through the early 1970s and featured villains in bold costumes accompanied by jazz scores from composers such as Martin Böttcher and Peter Thomas. &quot;Fellowship of the Frog&quot; (1959), about a murderer terrorizing London, was successful in America, leading to similar adaptations like &quot;The Green Archer&quot; (1961) and &quot;Dead Eyes of London&quot; (1961). The Rialto Studio produced 32 &quot;Krimi&quot; films between 1959 and 1970.

Italy&#x27;s &quot;giallo&quot; thrillers are crime procedurals or murder mysteries interlaced with eroticism and psychological horror. &quot;Giallo&quot; films feature unidentified killers murdering in grand fashions. Unlike most American slasher films the protagonists of &quot;gialli&quot; are frequently (but not always) jet-setting adults sporting the most stylish Milan fashions. These protagonists are often outsiders reluctantly brought into the mystery through extenuating circumstances, like witnessing a murder or being suspected of the crimes themselves. Much like &quot;Krimi&quot; films, &quot;gialli&quot; plots tended to be outlandish and improbable, occasionally employing supernatural elements. Mario Bava&#x27;s &quot;A Bay of Blood&quot; (1971) is a whodunit featuring a subplot depicting creative death sequences on a secluded lakeside setting, which greatly inspired &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980), its 1981 sequel and subsequent slashers. Sergio Martino&#x27;s &quot;Torso&quot; (1973) featured a masked killer preying upon beautiful and promiscuous young women in retribution for a past misdeed. &quot;Torso&quot;&#x27;s edge-of-your-seat climax finds a sensible &quot;final girl&quot; facing off with the killer in an isolated villa. Umberto Lenzi&#x27;s &quot;Eyeball&quot; (1975), which unfolds in an Agatha Christie manner, is noted by some as a slasher precursor, as American tourists are targeted by a killer wearing a red raincoat.

The influence of Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; extended also to &quot;gialli&quot;, with films such as &quot;The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh&quot; (1971), &quot;The Case of the Scorpion&#x27;s Tail&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Crimes of the Black Cat&quot; (1972) paying homage to Hitchcock&#x27;s film. &quot;Gialli&quot; were popular in American cinemas and drive-in theaters. Thriller &quot;Assault&quot; (1971) and Spanish mystery &quot;A Dragonfly for Each Corpse&quot; (1974) share many traits with Italian &quot;gialli&quot;. &quot;Death Steps in the Dark&quot; (1977) spoofed the familiar conventions found in &quot;giallo&quot; films. Despite successes from &quot;Deep Red&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Blood-Stained Shadow&quot; (1978), &quot;giallo&quot; films gradually fell out of fashion by the mid-1970s as diminishing returns forced budget cuts. Films such as &quot;Play Motel&quot; (1979) and &quot;Giallo a Venezia&quot; (1979) exploited their low-budgets with shocking hardcore pornography.

===Exploitation films===

The early 1970s saw an increase in exploitation films that lured audiences to grindhouses and drive-ins by advertising of sex and violence. Robert Fuest&#x27;s &quot;And Soon the Darkness&quot; (1970) set off the &#x27;70s exploitation wave by maximizing its small budget and taking place in daylight. &quot;The Jekyll and Hyde Portfolio&quot; (1971) follows an insane killer who stalks and murders victims at a nursing academy. &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot; (1971) depicts the psychological trauma suffered by Jack the Ripper&#x27;s daughter, who continues the murderous reign of her father. &quot;Fright&quot; (1971) is based on the &quot;babysitter and the man upstairs&quot; urban legend while &quot;Tower of Evil&quot; (1972) features careless partying teens murdered in a remote island lighthouse. Pete Walker broke taboos by advertising his films&#x27; negative reviews to attract viewers looking for the depraved, using a &quot;no press is bad press&quot; mantra with &quot;The Flesh and Blood Show&quot; (1972), &quot;Frightmare&quot; (1974), &quot;House of Mortal Sin&quot; (1976), &quot;Schizo&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Comeback&quot; (1978). Other filmmakers followed Walker&#x27;s lead, as posters dubbed &quot;Blood and Lace&quot; (1971) as &quot;sickest PG-rated movie ever made!&quot;, while &quot;Scream Bloody Murder&quot; (1973) called itself &quot;gore-nography.&quot;

By 1974 the exploitation film battled political correctness and their popularity waned, and while films like &quot;The Love Butcher&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Redeemer: Son of Satan&quot; (1976) were accused of promoting bigotry, the low-budget independent film &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974) became a major hit and the most commercially successful horror film since &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. The story concerns a violent clash of cultures and ideals between the counter-culture and traditional conservative values, with the film&#x27;s squealing antagonist Leatherface carrying a chainsaw and wearing the faces of victims he and his family eat. &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; spawned imitators and its false &quot;based on a true story&quot; advertisements gave way to reenactments of true crime. &quot;The Town That Dreaded Sundown&quot; (1976), based on the Phantom Killer case, and &quot;Another Son of Sam&quot; (1977), based on the Son of Sam slayings, cashed-in on headlines and public fascination. Wes Craven modernized the Sawney Bean legend in &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (1977) by building upon themes presented in &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; was another huge financial success, relaunching Craven&#x27;s career after it had been damaged by controversy surrounding his previous film, &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; (1972).

Following holiday-themed exploitation films &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1972), &quot;All Through the House&quot; (1972) and &quot;Silent Night, Bloody Night&quot; (1973), Christmas horror film &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974) uses horror as a board to debate social topics of its time, including feminism, abortion, and alcoholism. Using the &quot;killer calling from inside the house&quot; gimmick, &quot;Black Christmas&quot; is visually and thematically a precursor to John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), as young women are terrorized in a previously safe environment during an iconic holiday. Like &quot;Halloween&quot;, Clark&#x27;s film opens with a lengthy point-of-view, but it differs in the treatment of the killer&#x27;s identity. Despite making $4,053,000 on a $620,000 budget, &quot;Black Christmas&quot; was initially criticized, with &quot;Variety&quot; complaining that it was a &quot;bloody, senseless kill-for-kicks&quot; flick that exploited unnecessary violence. Despite its modest initial box office run, the film has garnered critical reappraisal, with film historians noting its importance in the horror film genre and some even citing it as the original slasher film.

==1978–1984: Golden Age==
Jumpstarted by the massive success of John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), the era commonly cited as the Golden Age of slasher films is 1978–1984, with some scholars citing over 100 similar films released over the six-year period. Despite most films receiving negative reviews, many Golden Age slasher films were extremely profitable and have established cult followings. Many films reused &quot;Halloween&quot;&#x27;s template of a murderous figure stalking teens, though they escalated the gore and nudity from Carpenter&#x27;s restrained film. Golden Age slasher films exploited dangers lurking in American institutions such as high schools, colleges, summer camps, and hospitals.

===1978===
Cashing in on the drive-in success of &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), &quot;The Toolbox Murders&quot; was quickly and cheaply shot but did not generate the interest of the former films. Exploitative &quot;Killer&#x27;s Delight&quot; is a San Francisco-set serial killer story claiming to take inspiration from Ted Bundy and the Zodiac Killer. Leading up to &quot;Halloween&quot;&#x27;s October release were August&#x27;s &quot;gialli&quot;-inspired &quot;Eyes of Laura Mars&quot; (written by John Carpenter) and September&#x27;s &quot;babysitter in peril&quot; TV Movie &quot;Are You in the House Alone?&quot; Of them, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Eyes of Laura Mars&quot; grossed $20 million against a $7 million budget.

Influenced by the French New Wave&#x27;s &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot; (1960), science fiction thriller &quot;Westworld&quot; (1973) and &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974), &quot;Halloween&quot; was directed, composed and co-written by Carpenter, and produced and co-written by Debra Hill on a budget of $300,000 provided by Syrian-American producer Moustapha Akkad. To minimize costs, locations were reduced and time took place over a brief period. Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of Janet Leigh, was cast as the heroine Laurie Strode while veteran actor Donald Pleasence was cast as Dr. Sam Loomis, an homage to John Gavin&#x27;s character in &quot;Psycho&quot;. &quot;Halloween&quot;&#x27;s opening tracks a six-year-old&#x27;s point-of-view as he kills his older sister, a scene emulated in numerous films such as &quot;Blow Out&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Funhouse&quot; (1981). Carpenter and Hill deny writing sexually active teens to be victims in favor of a virginal &quot;final girl&quot; survivor, though subsequent filmmakers copied what appeared to be a &quot;sex-equals-death&quot; mantra.

When shown an early cut of &quot;Halloween&quot; without a musical score, all major American studios declined to distribute it, one executive even remarking that it was not scary. Carpenter added music himself, and the film was distributed locally in four Kansas City theaters through Akkad&#x27;s Compass International Pictures in October 1978. Word-of-mouth made the movie a sleeper hit that was selected to screen at the November 1978 Chicago Film Festival, where the country&#x27;s major critics acclaimed it. &quot;Halloween&quot; grew into a major box office success, grossing over $70 million worldwide and selling over 20 million tickets in North America, becoming the most profitable independent film until being surpassed by &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (1990).

===1979===
Though the telekinesis-themed slasher &quot;Tourist Trap&quot; was initially unsuccessful, it has undergone a reappraisal by fans. 1979&#x27;s most successful slasher was Fred Walton&#x27;s &quot;When a Stranger Calls&quot;, which sold 8.5 million tickets in North America. Its success has largely been credited to its opening scene, in which a babysitter (Carol Kane) is taunted by a caller who repeatedly asks, &quot;Have you checked the children?&quot; Less successful were Ray Dennis Steckler&#x27;s burlesque slasher &quot;The Hollywood Strangler Meets the Skid Row Slasher&quot; and Abel Ferrara&#x27;s &quot;The Driller Killer&quot;, both of which featured gratuitous on-screen violence against vagrant people.

===1980===
The election of Ronald Reagan as the 40th president of the United States drew in a new age of conservatism that ushered concern of rising violence on film. The slasher film, at the height of its commercial power, also became the center of a political and cultural maelstrom. Sean S. Cunningham&#x27;s sleeper hit &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was the year&#x27;s most commercially successful slasher film, grossing more than $59.7 million and selling nearly 15 million tickets in North America. Despite a financial success, distributor Paramount Pictures was criticized for &quot;lowering&quot; itself to release a violent exploitation film, with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert famously despising the film. Siskel, in his &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; review, revealed the identity and fate of the film&#x27;s killer in an attempt to hurt its box office, and provided the address of the chairman of Paramount Pictures for viewers to complain. The MPAA was criticized for allowing &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; an R rating, but its violence would inspire gorier films to follow, as it set a new bar for acceptable levels of on-screen violence. The criticisms that began with &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; would lead to the genre&#x27;s eventual decline in subsequent years.

The small-budget thrillers &quot;Silent Scream&quot; and &quot;Prom Night&quot; were box office hits with 3.2 and 5.5 million admissions, respectively. Jamie Lee Curtis starred in the independent &quot;Prom Night&quot;, as well studio films &quot;Terror Train&quot; and &quot;The Fog&quot; to earn her &quot;scream queen&quot; title. MGM&#x27;s the &quot;Halloween&quot;-clone &quot;He Knows You&#x27;re Alone&quot; sold nearly 2 million tickets, though Paramount Pictures John Huston-directed &quot;Phobia&quot; only sold an estimated 22,000 tickets. Two high-profile slasher-thrillers were met with protest, William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;Cruising&quot; and Gordon Willis&#x27; &quot;Windows&quot;, both of which equate homosexuality with psychosis. &quot;Cruising&quot; drew protests from gay rights groups, and though it pre-dates the AIDS crisis, the film&#x27;s portrayal of the gay community fueled subsequent backlash once the virus became an epidemic.

Low budget exploitative films &quot;New Year&#x27;s Evil&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go in the House&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Answer the Phone!&quot; were called-out for misogyny that dwelled on the suffering of females exclusively. Acclaimed filmmaker Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;-homage &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; drew a wave of protest from the National Organization for Women (NOW), who picketed the film&#x27;s screening on the University of Iowa campus. The year&#x27;s most controversial slasher was William Lustig&#x27;s &quot;Maniac&quot;, about a schizophrenic serial killer in New York. &quot;Maniac&quot; was maligned by critics. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that watching the film was like &quot;watching someone else throw up.&quot; Lustig released the film unrated on American screens, sidestepping the MPAA to still sell 2.2 million tickets at the box office.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;&#x27;s influence was felt two decades later in &quot;Cries in the Night&quot; and &quot;The Unseen&quot;. Joe D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s gruesome Italian horror film &quot;Antropophagus&quot; and the Australian slasher &quot;Nightmares&quot; showed that the genre was spreading internationally.

===1981===
Slasher films reached a saturation point in 1981, as heavily promoted movies like &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot; and &quot;The Burning&quot; were box office failures. After the success of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, Paramount Pictures picked up &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot; with hopes to achieve similar success. The film became the subject of intense scrutiny in the wake of John Lennon&#x27;s murder, and was released heavily edited; lacking the draw of gore, &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot; barely sold 2 million tickets in North America, much less than the 15 million sold by &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; the year beforehand. Thematically similar to &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot;, &quot;The Prowler&quot; hoped to lure an audience with gore effects by &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;&#x27;s Tom Savini but large MPAA edits contributed to its failure to find a nationwide distributor. Suffering similar censorship was &quot;The Burning&quot;, which also employed Savini&#x27;s special effects, though it does mark the feature film debuts of Brad Grey, Holly Hunter, Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein.

Profits of &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; drew studio interest, to varying success. Warner Bros.&#x27;s &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot; (402,386 admissions) and &quot;Night School&quot; (420,818 admission),Paramount Pictures&#x27; &quot; The Fan&quot; (1.1 million admissions), Universal Pictures &quot;The Funhouse&quot; (2.8 million admissions), and Columbia Pictures Happy Birthday to Me (3.8 million admissions). CBS&#x27; TV movie, &quot;Dark Night of the Scarecrow&quot; brought the genre to the small screen. Two sequels had bigger body counts and more gore than their predecessors, but not higher box office intakes. &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot; sold 7.8 million tickets and &quot;Halloween II&quot; sold 9.2 million. Both sequels sold under half of their original film&#x27;s tickets, though they were still very popular (&quot;Halloween II&quot; was the second highest-grossing horror film of the year behind &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;).

Independent companies churned out slasher films &quot;Final Exam&quot;, &quot;Bloody Birthday&quot;, &quot;Hell Night&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go in the Woods... Alone!&quot;, Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Deadly Blessing&quot; and &quot;Graduation Day&quot;. Fantasy and sci-fi genres continued to blend with the slasher film in &quot;Strange Behavior&quot;, &quot;Ghostkeeper&quot; and &quot;Evilspeak&quot;. The international market found Italy&#x27;s &quot;Absurd&quot; and &quot;Madhouse&quot; and Germany&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Moon&quot;.

===1982===
Straight-to-video productions cut costs to maximize profit. The independent horror film &quot;Madman&quot; opened in New York City&#x27;s top 10, according to &quot;Variety,&quot; but soon fell out of theaters for a much healthier life on home video. &quot;The Dorm That Dripped Blood&quot; and &quot;Honeymoon Horror&quot;, each made for between $50–90,000, became successful in the early days of VHS. Because of this change, independent productions began having difficulties finding theatrical distribution. &quot;Girls Nite Out&quot; had a very limited release in 1982 but was re-released in 1983 in more theaters until finally finding a home on VHS. Paul Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Humongous&quot; was released through AVCO Embassy Pictures, but a change in management severely limited the film&#x27;s theatrical release. Films such as &quot;Hospital Massacre&quot; and &quot;Night Warning&quot; enjoyed strong home rentals from video stores, though &quot;Dark Sanity&quot;, &quot;The Forest&quot;, &quot;Unhinged&quot;, &quot;Trick or Treats&quot;, and &quot;Island of Blood&quot; fell into obscurity with little theatrical releases and only sub-par video transfers.

Supernatural slasher films continued to build in popularity with &quot;The Slayer&quot;, &quot;The Incubus&quot;, &quot;Blood Song&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go to Sleep&quot; and &quot;Superstition&quot; (the supernatural-themed &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;, though part of the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise, does not adhere to the slasher film formula). &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; was New Line Cinema&#x27;s first feature film, released to little revenue and initially dismissed by critics, though the film has gained critical reappraisal. Director Amy Holden Jones and writer Rita Mae Brown gender-swapped to showcase exploitative violence against men in &quot;The Slumber Party Massacre,&quot; while &quot;Visiting Hours&quot; pitted liberal feminism against macho right-wing bigotry with exploitative results.

&quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot;, the first slasher trilogy, was an enormous success, selling 12 million tickets and dethroning &quot;E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial&quot; from the top of the box office. The film&#x27;s iconic hockey mask has grown to pop-culture iconography. Universal Pictures had a tiny release for &quot;Death Valley&quot;, while Columbia Pictures found modest success with &quot;Silent Rage&quot;. Independent distributor Embassy Pictures released &quot;The Seduction&quot; to a surprising 3.9 million admissions, making a hit erotic slasher-thriller that predates blockbusters &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987) and &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992) by several years.

Internationally, Australia released &quot;Next of Kin&quot; while Puerto Rico&#x27;s &quot;Pieces&quot; was filmed in Boston and Madrid by an Italian-American producer with a Spanish director. Italian &quot;gialli&quot; saw slasher film influences in their releases for Sergio Martino&#x27;s &quot;The Scorpion with Two Tails&quot;, Lucio Fulci&#x27;s &quot;The New York Ripper&quot; and Dario Argento&#x27;s &quot;Tenebrae&quot;.

===1983===
Traditional slasher films saw less frequent output. &quot;The House on Sorority Row&quot; followed the same general plot as &quot;Prom Night&quot; (1980) with guilty teens stalked and punished for a terrible secret. &quot;The Final Terror&quot; borrows visual and thematic elements from &quot;Just Before Dawn&quot; (1981), as &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; borrows from &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot; (1981). The most successful slasher of the year was &quot;Psycho II&quot;, which sold over 11 million theatrical admissions. The film also reunited original &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) cast members Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles. &quot;10 to Midnight,&quot; inspired by the real-life crimes of Richard Speck, promoted star Charles Bronson&#x27;s justice-for-all character above its horror themes. Robert Hiltzik&#x27;s &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; was a home video hit, being unique for its pubescent victims and themes of paedophilia and transvestism. &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; featured homosexual scenes, which were taboo at the time.

In Canada, whodunit &quot;Curtains&quot; had a brief theatrical life before finding new life on VHS, while criticism toward &quot;American Nightmare&quot;&#x27;s portrayal of prostitutes, drug addicts, and pornography addicts hurt its video rentals. &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; was shot-on-video for just $40,000, with a gender-reversal climax showing &quot;Playgirl&quot; model Ted Prior as a &quot;final guy.&quot; Other home video slashers from the year include &quot;Blood Beat,&quot; &quot;Double Exposure&quot;, and &quot;Scalps&quot;, the latter claiming to be one of the most censored films in history. Releases began to distance from the genre. The poster for &quot;Mortuary&quot; features a hand bursting from the grave, though the undead have nothing to do with the film. Distributors were aware of fading box office profits, and they were attempting to hoodwink audiences into thinking long-shelved releases like &quot;Mortuary&quot; were different.

===1984===
The public had largely lost interest in theatrically released slashers, drawing a close to the Golden Age. Production rates plummeted and major studios all but abandoned the genre that, only a few years earlier, had been very profitable. Many 1984 slasher films with brief theatrical runs found varying degrees of success on home video, such as &quot;Splatter University&quot;, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Blade&quot;, &quot;Blood Theatre&quot;, &quot;Rocktober Blood&quot; and &quot;Fatal Games&quot;. Movies like &quot;The Prey&quot; and &quot;Evil Judgement&quot; were filmed years prior and finally were given small theatrical releases. &quot;Silent Madness&quot; used 3D to ride the success of &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot; (1982), though the effect did not translate to the VHS format.

&quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot; brought the saga of Jason Voorhees to a close, with his demise the main marketing tool. It worked, with &quot;The Final Chapter&quot; selling 10 million tickets in North America, hinting the series would continue even if Jason&#x27;s demise marked a shift in the genre.

This shift was emphasized by the controversy from &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot; (1984): Unlike the recent appearance of other Christmas horror films, including the same year&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Open till Christmas&quot;, promotional material for &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot; pictured a killer Santa with the tagline: &quot;He knows when you&#x27;ve been naughty!&quot; According to &quot;Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film&quot;, a 2006 documentary, the movie &quot;became the flashpoint, igniting protests across the nation&quot;. Protesters picketed theaters playing the film with placards reading, &quot;Deck the hall with holly – not bodies!&quot; Released in November 1984 by TriStar Pictures, persistent carol-singers forced one Bronx cinema to pull &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot; a week into its run. The widespread outrage led to the film&#x27;s removal, with only 741,500 tickets sold.

As interest in the Golden Age slasher waned, Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; revitalized the genre by mixing fantasy and the supernatural in a cost-effective way. Craven had toyed with slasher films before in &quot;Deadly Blessing&quot; (1981), though he was frustrated that the genre he had helped create with &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (1977) had not benefited him financially. Developing &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; since 1981, Craven recognized time running out due to declining revenues from theatrical slasher film releases. &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and especially its villain Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) became cultural phenomenons. On a budget of just $1.8 million, the film was a commercial success, grossing more than $25.5 million (7.6 million admissions) in North America and launched one of the most successful film series in history. &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; provided the success that New Line Cinema needed to become a major Hollywood company. To this day, New Line is referred to as &quot;The House That Freddy Built&quot;. The final slasher film released during the Golden Age, &quot;The Initiation&quot;, was greatly overshadowed by &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (though both films feature dreams as plot points and a horribly burned &quot;nightmare man&quot;). The success of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; welcomed in a new wave of horror films that relied on special effects, almost completely silencing the smaller low-budget Golden Age features.

==1984–1995: Direct-to-video films and franchises==
Despite &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;&#x27;s success, fatigue hit the slasher genre, and its popularity had declined substantially. The home video revolution, fueled by the popularity of VHS, provided a new outlet for low-budget filmmaking. Without major studio backing for theatrical release, slasher films became second only to pornography in the home video market. The drop in budgets to accommodate a more economic approach was usually met with a decline in quality. Holdovers filmed during the Golden Age such as &quot;Too Scared to Scream&quot; (filmed in 1981, released in 1985), &quot;The Mutilator&quot; (filmed in 1984, released in 1985), &quot;Blood Rage&quot; (filmed in 1983, released in 1987), &quot;Killer Party&quot; (filmed in 1984, released in 1986) and &quot;Mountaintop Motel Massacre&quot; (filmed in 1983, released in 1986) found video distribution.

Mirroring the punk rock movement, novice filmmakers proved anyone could make a movie on home video, resulting in shot-on-video slashers &quot;Blood Cult&quot; (1985), &quot;The Ripper&quot; (1985), &quot;Spine&quot; (1986), &quot;Truth or Dare?&quot; (1986), &quot;Killer Workout&quot; (1987), and &quot;Death Spa&quot; (1989). Lesser-known horror properties &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot;, &quot;The Slumber Party Massacre&quot; and &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot; became series on home video. &quot;The Hills Have Eyes Part 2&quot; (1985) and &quot;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning&quot; (1985) were theatrically released but neither film was embraced by fans or critics and took steep box office declines from their predecessors; still, &quot;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning&quot; was a modest hit opening at the top of the box office and finishing its run with 6.2 million admissions. Rushed into production, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1985) became the highest grossing horror film of 1985. The success of the first two &quot;Elm Street&quot; films inspired a wave of &quot;dream&quot; slashers that included &quot;Dreamaniac&quot; (1986), &quot;Bad Dreams&quot; (1988), &quot;Deadly Dreams&quot; (1988), and &quot;Dream Demon&quot; (1988). Of those films, &quot;Bad Dreams&quot; was a minor hit with 2.4 million admissions.

Paramount Pictures released the parody &quot;April Fool&#x27;s Day&quot; (1986) with hopes to start a sister series to its &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; property, though the film&#x27;s modest 3.5 million admissions never led to a series. Three other spoofs, &quot;Evil Laugh&quot; (1986), &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; (1986) and &quot;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&quot; (1986), were box office disappointments; &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; sold just 2 million tickets while &quot;Jason Lives&quot; sold 5.2 million, both significantly down from their predecessors. The home video market saw the output of low-budget, tongue-in-cheek slashers like &quot;Stripped to Kill&quot; (1987), &quot;Return to Horror High&quot; (1987), and &quot;Killer Workout&quot; (1987), and previous franchises forgoing theaters for direct-to-video self-parody sequels in &quot;Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II&quot; (1987), &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2&quot; (1987), &quot;Slumber Party Massacre II&quot; (1987), &quot;Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers&quot; (1988), and &quot;Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland&quot; (1989).

Trying to cater the public of adult action thrillers that were popular in the 1980s, Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s cop-thriller &quot;Cobra&quot; (1986) is a thinly-veiled slasher film advertised as an action movie, and sold 13.2 million tickets. The home video market made stars out of character actors such as Terry O&#x27;Quinn and Bruce Campbell, whose respective independent horror-thrillers &quot;The Stepfather&quot; (1987) and &quot;Maniac Cop&quot; (1988) found more support on home video than in theaters. Quinn returned for &quot;Stepfather II&quot; (1989) but chose not to reprise his role in &quot;Stepfather III&quot; (1992), &quot;Destroyer&quot; (1988), while Campbell followed a similar route with a cameo in &quot;Maniac Cop 2&quot; (1990) and no participation in &quot;Maniac Cop III: Badge of Silence&quot; (1993).

The &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series dominated the late 1980s horror wave, with &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987) selling 11.5 million tickets in North America, and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot; (1988) following another 12 million tickets. By comparison, &quot;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&quot; (1988) and &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot; (1988) sold approximately 4.5 million tickets each, less than half of the &quot;Elm Street&quot; films. The personality-driven appeal of Freddy Krueger was not lost on filmmakers, as characters like Chucky and Candyman were given ample dialogue and placed in urban settings that had largely been ignored by the Golden Age. Chucky&#x27;s &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1988) and its 1990 sequel sold over 14.7 million tickets combined, while &quot;Candyman&quot; (1992) sold a healthy 6.2 million. Both series fell out rather quickly, when &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; (1991) selling only 3.5 million tickets in North America and &quot;&quot; (1995) selling only 3.2 million.

Internationally, the slasher film remained profitable. Mexico released &quot;Zombie Apocalypse&quot; (1985), &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot; (1988), &quot;Grave Robbers&quot; (1990) and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Trap&quot; (1990). Europe saw releases from Sweden&#x27;s &quot;Blood Tracks&quot; (1985), The United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer&quot; (1987), Spain&#x27;s &quot;Anguish&quot; (1987) and Italy&#x27;s &quot;StageFright&quot; (1987) and &quot;BodyCount&quot; (1987). In the Pacific, Australia released &quot;Symphony of Evil&quot; (1987), &quot;Houseboat Horror&quot; (1989), and &quot;Bloodmoon&quot; (1990), while Japan released &quot;Evil Dead Trap&quot; (1988).

By 1989 the major series had faded from public interest, resulting in box office failures from &quot;Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,&quot; and &quot;Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot;. &quot;The Dream Child&quot;&#x27;s 5.6 million tickets were a sharp decline, while &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot; and &quot;The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot; each sold roughly 3 million tickets. Due to the declining ticket sales, rights to the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;Halloween&quot; series were sold to New Line Cinema and Miramax Films, respectively. Now owning both the Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger characters, New Line would look into a series-crossover event film. &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; (1991) and &quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot; (1993) began this crossover series, but profit losses from both films stalled the project for a decade. &quot;&quot; (1995) was released under Miramax&#x27;s Dimension Films banner to negative fan reaction and a weak box office, forcing its producers to reboot the franchise with the next entry.

==1996–2002: Genre revival==
Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;New Nightmare&quot; (1994) used characters from his original &quot;Elm Street&quot; film in self-referential and ironic ways, as the actors played versions of their true personas targeted by a movie-inspired demon. Despite solid critical reviews, &quot;New Nightmare&quot; failed to attract moviegoers and sold only 2.3 million tickets the North American box office, the lowest of any &quot;Elm Street&quot; film. The slasher genre&#x27;s surprising meta-resurgence came in the form of Craven&#x27;s sleeper hit &quot;Scream&quot; (1996). Directed by Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, &quot;Scream&quot; juggled postmodern humor with visceral horror. The film played on nostalgia for the golden age of slasher films, but appealed to a younger audience with contemporary stars and popular music. Williamson, a self-confessed fan of slasher films, wrote the characters as well-versed in horror film lore and knowing all the clichés that the audience were aware of. With 23.3 million admissions, &quot;Scream&quot; became both the highest grossing slasher film of all time and the first of the genre to cross $100 million at the domestic box office, The marketing for &quot;Scream&quot; distanced itself from the slasher genre as it passed itself as a &quot;new thriller&quot; that showcased the celebrity of its stars Drew Barrymore, Courteney Cox and Neve Campbell over its horror elements.

Williamson&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997), was inspired by &quot;Prom Night&quot; (1980) and &quot;The House on Sorority Row&quot; (1983). Released less than a year after &quot;Scream&quot; to &quot;critic proof&quot; success, the film sold nearly 16 million tickets at the North American box office. Two months later Dimension Films released &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997) ; the sequel sold 22 million tickets and was a critical hit. Taking note of the marketing success of &quot;Scream&quot;, the promotional materials for &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Scream 2&quot; relied heavily on the recognizability of cast-members Portia de Rossi, Rebecca Gayheart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Heather Graham, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Joshua Jackson, Laurie Metcalf, Jerry O&#x27;Connell, Ryan Phillippe, Jada Pinkett, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Liev Schreiber.

The two &quot;Scream&quot; films and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; were also popular in international markets. In Asia, Hong Kong released &quot;The Deadly Camp&quot; (1999) and South Korea released &quot;Bloody Beach&quot; (2000), &quot;The Record&quot; (2001), and &quot;Nightmare&quot; (2000). Australia&#x27;s postmodern slasher &quot;Cut&quot; (2000) cast American actress Molly Ringwald as its heroine. Britain released &quot;Lighthouse&quot; (1999) and the Netherlands had two teen slashers, &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Pool&quot; (2001). Bollywood produced two unofficial remakes of&quot; I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;: the first was a musical-slasher hybrid called &quot;Kucch To Hai&quot; (2003), while the second was a more straightforward slasher called &quot;&quot; (2003).

&quot;Scream 2&quot; marked a high-point of public interest in the 1990s slasher revival with a massive marketing campaign and a cultural zeitgeist. This anticipation greenlit the production of several other slasher films to be released the following year. &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998) was a reasonable hit, selling 8 million tickets, though its decline from the &quot;Scream&quot; films and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; showed that slasher film sales were already starting to decline. Three 1998 sequels were each significant successes at the domestic box office; &quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot; had 11.7 million admissions, &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; had 6.9 million admissions, and &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; had 8.9 million admissions. Again, the marketing for these sequels relied on the appeal their casts, which included Adam Arkin, Jack Black, LL Cool J, Jamie Lee Curtis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Josh Hartnett, Katherine Heigl, Brandy Norwood, Jodi Lynn O&#x27;Keefe, Mekhi Phifer, John Ritter, Jennifer Tilly, and Michelle Williams. Low-budget slasher films &quot;The Clown at Midnight&quot; (1998) and &quot;Cherry Falls&quot; (2000) had trouble competing with big-budget horror films that could afford bankable actors.

&quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000), the first entry in the &quot;Scream&quot; series not written by Kevin Williamson, was another huge success with 16.5 million tickets sold, &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; (2000) sold a meager 4 million tickets, The third films in the &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Urban Legend&quot; sequels were relegated to the direct-to-video market with a lack of bankable stars.

After the turn of the millennium, the post-&quot;Scream&quot; wave of slasher films were both critically and financially disappointing, leading to the genre&#x27;s sharp decline. These films include 2001&#x27;s &quot;Valentine&quot; (11% Rotten Tomatoes, 3.5 million admissions) and &quot;Jason X&quot; (19% Rotten Tomatoes, 2.3 million admissions), and 2002&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (10% Rotten Tomatoes, 5.2 million admissions). In development for 17 years with 17 different writers attached to at different points, New Line Cinema&#x27;s &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; (2003) took note from the &quot;Scream&quot; films and mixed nostalgia and self-aware humor with recognizable actors. It sold a massive 14 million tickets at the domestic box office and beat &quot;Scream 2&quot;&#x27;s record opening weekend with a gross of $36.4 million over three days.

== 2003–Present: Post modern slashers ==
Successful horror films including &quot;Final Destination&quot; (2000), &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; (2001) and &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000) used slasher tropes but deviated from the standard formula set forth by movies such as &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984) and &quot;Scream&quot; (1996). The filmmakers behind &quot;Make a Wish&quot; (2002) and &quot;HellBent&quot; (2004) diversified their films to appeal to LGBT audiences. African American filmmakers with largely black casts in &quot;Killjoy&quot; (2000), &quot;Holla If I Kill You&quot; (2003), &quot;Holla&quot; (2006), and &quot;Somebody Help Me&quot; (2007).

2003 saw a turning point and minor-revival of the slasher where filmmakers sought to return the genre to its grittier, exploitative roots. Musician Rob Zombie&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; had a and only sold approximately 2 million tickets at the domestic box office, and finished with 2.7 million admissions at the box office. 2003 also saw the release of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Wrong Turn.&quot; Made on a $12.6 million budget, &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; sold 2.5 million admissions 

===Remakes and reboots===
&quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003) became a sleeper hit by playing on public&#x27;s familiarity of the 1974 original but promising updated thrills and suspense.&quot;The&quot; &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; remake sold over 13.5 million tickets in North America and was followed by &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning&quot; (2006), which sold a respectable 6 million tickets, though it was still struck by diminishing returns.

Riding on the success of the &quot;Chainsaw Massacre&quot; remake was &quot;House of Wax&quot; (2005), &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (2006), &quot;April Fool&#x27;s Day&quot; (2008), &quot;Train&quot; (2008). Remakes of &quot;The Fog&quot; (2005), &quot;When a Stranger Calls&quot; (2006) and &quot;Prom Night&quot; (2008) were watered down, and released with PG-13 ratings to pull in the largest teenage audience possible, though only &quot;Prom Night&quot; sold more tickets than its original counterpart. Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (2007) took the simplicity of the original 1978 film but added an extreme vision that, according to critics, replaced everything that made the first film a success. Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; sold nearly 8.5 million tickets, , which sold under 4.5 million tickets. while its 2007 sequel received less enthusiasm with only 3 million admissions.

The remake-era peaked in 2009 with releases of &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, &quot;Sorority Row&quot;, &quot;The Stepfather&quot; and &quot;Halloween II&quot;. Of those, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was most successful selling 8.7 million tickets and &quot;Sorority Row&quot; was least successful with under 1.6 million tickets sold. The following year &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street remake&quot;, like the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; remake, had a large opening weekend but quickly fell off the box office charts after with 7.8 million admissions. Straight-to-video remakes &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010), &quot;Silent Night&quot; (2012) and &quot;Silent Night, Bloody Night: The Homecoming&quot; (2013) were met with little reception or praise. Released on 3D format, .

 the newer film received mixed critical reviews and failed financially with an estimated $154,418 in streaming sales. For their next slasher film, Blumhouse recruited director David Gordon Green and writer Danny McBride to reunite producer/composer John Carpenter and star Jamie Lee Curtis for &quot;Halloween&quot; (2018). As a direct sequel to Carpenter&#x27;s 1978 original film that ignored all other films in the franchise, 2018&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; opened to record-breaking numbers, including the largest debut for a slasher film and the largest debut of a female-led horror film. The film was a massive success and would go on to sell 17.4 million tickets at the domestic box office, second only to the 1978 original and the first two &quot;Scream&quot; films in terms of audience attendance for a slasher film. The film&#x27;s success spawned two sequels, &quot;Halloween Kills&quot; (2021) and &quot;Halloween Ends&quot; (2022), though they were struck with diminishing returns by selling a respective 9 million and 6.1 million tickets during their domestic runs. Blumhouse and Universal Pictures re-teamed to release a second remake of &quot;Black Christmas&quot; in 2019, which was poorly received and bombed at the box office.

The enormous financial success of 2018&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; inspired other legacy sequels. In 2021, the Jordan Peele produced &quot;Candyman&quot; (2021) sold approximately 6 million tickets The directing team Radio Silence rebooted the &quot;Scream&quot; franchise in 2022 by 2022&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot; became a sleeper hit with 8 million admissions, and the following year &quot;Scream VI&quot; sold an impressive 10.3 million tickets at the domestic box office. Like &quot;Halloween&quot;, Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2022) brought back its franchise&#x27;s famous villain (Leatherface) to face off against its original final girl (Sally Hardesty, played by Olwen Fouéré replacing the late Marilyn Burns). &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; was marred by production difficulties and received negative critical reviews, though it still received high viewership. Buddy Cooper, director of &quot;The Mutilator&quot; (1985), has reunited with his film&#x27;s original stars for &quot;Mutilator 2&quot;, which is currently looking for distribution.

===Television works===
In the early 2010s, the success of FX&#x27;s &quot;American Horror Story&quot; and AMC&#x27;s &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; encouraged network television to develop horror franchises as series. Several networks structured or based their developing TV series on slasher films. A&amp;E produced &quot;Bates Motel&quot; as a contemporary prequel to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1960s classic &quot;Psycho&quot;, which depicted the lives of Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore) and his deranged mother Norma (Vera Farmiga). The series remains A&amp;E&#x27;s longest-running scripted drama program, and particular praise was given to Highmore and Farmiga, with the latter receiving a Primetime Emmy nomination.

MTV tried to ride off the success of &quot;Bates Motel&quot; by producing &quot;Scream: The TV Series&quot;. Being a completely different story from the film series and not featuring the iconic Ghostface villain, &quot;Scream: The TV Series&quot; ran for two seasons between 2015 and 2016. After the conclusion of its second season, a two-hour Halloween special aired in October 2016. A third season was released by VH1 in 2019 titled &quot;Scream: Resurrection&quot;, which used the Ghostface moniker, though was met with negative reviews and poor ratings. A TV remake of &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; aired on Lifetime in fall 2018. Beginning in October 2021, &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; creator Don Mancini continued his flagship franchise by moving its story to the small screen with Syfy Channel&#x27;s &quot;Chucky&quot;. Starring &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; regulars Brad Dourif, Jennifer Tilly, Fiona Dourif, and Alex Vincent, &quot;Chucky&quot; has received critical acclaim and is currently in its third season. Also in 2021, Amazon released one season of &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, a modern adaptation of Lois Duncan&#x27;s 1973 novel and the 1997 slasher of the same title. Like Freeform&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; and The CW&#x27;s &quot;Riverdale,&quot; the &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; series took more restrained approaches to the young adult demographic and toned down the slasher violence. Bryan Fuller is currently writing a &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; television series titled &quot;Crystal Lake&quot; for A24 and Peacock.

Slasher anthologies allowed filmmakers to explore new settings and mysteries every season. In 2015 Ryan Murphy, the creator of &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, produced the comedy-slasher series &quot;Scream Queens&quot; for Fox. Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Emma Roberts, Keke Palmer, Niecy Nash, Billie Lourd, and Abigail Breslin, the series developed a devoted cult following but was cancelled after two seasons. Created by Aaron Martin, an anthology series simply titled &quot;Slasher&quot; premiered on the streaming platform Chiller in 2016. The first season, subtitled &quot;The Executioner&quot;, received positive reviews. &quot;Slasher&quot; moved to Netflix for its second and third seasons, titled &quot;Guilty Party&quot; and &quot;Solstice&quot;, and then to Shudder for its fourth and fifth seasons, titled &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; and &quot;Ripper&quot;. In 2022, writer Ryan J. Brown debuted his comedy-horror series &quot;Wreck&quot; on BBC Three which takes inspiration from slasher and horror fiction.

 both of which were critical successes with 80% and 93% respectively on Rotten Tomatoes. &quot;Don&#x27;t Breathe&quot; (2016) was a commercial success with 10.3 million admissions and an 88% critical approval on Rotten Tomatoes. like &quot;The Strangers: Prey at Night&quot; (2018), &quot;Hell Fest&quot; (2018), &quot;Haunt&quot; (2019) and &quot;There&#x27;s Someone Inside Your House&quot; (2021) found success on streaming services such as Shudder and Netflix, while Eli Roth&#x27;s long-awaited &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; (2023) was a minor hit at the box office with 3.5 million admissions.

A series of original, low-budget slasher franchises began to emerge in the early 2020s. Damien Leone&#x27;s &quot;Terrifier&quot; (2016) drew attention for its villain Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton) and its inventive practical effects, Leone&#x27;s received much more attention and positive reviews (86% on Rotten Tomatoes) with many reviewers commenting on the development of its final girl (played by Lauren LaVera). Released by Bloody Disgusting, &quot;Terrifier 2&quot; became a box office success with over one million domestic admissions. &quot;Terrifier 3&quot; was released in 2024 with Leone, Thornton, and LaVera returning. The film became the highest-grossing unrated film of all time, raking in over $50 million in box office. Also working on low-budgets for independent distributor A24, director Ti West delivered a trilogy of slashers that received critical acclaim. West&#x27;s first film, the 1970s-set &quot;X&quot; (2022), starred Mia Goth, Scott Mescudi, Brittany Snow, and Jenna Ortega and scored 94% on Rotten Tomatoes and sold over a million tickets. West reunited with Goth for &quot;X&quot;&#x27;s 1920s-set prequel &quot;Pearl&quot; (2022), which scored even higher at 93% and sold just under a million tickets. Both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; were successful on streaming downloads. &quot;X&quot;&#x27;s 1980s-set sequel &quot;MaXXXine&quot;, the final film in the trilogy, also stars Goth and was released in 2024.

Blumhouse Productions released &quot;Happy Death Day&quot; (2017) and &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; (2018). Pitched as &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (1993) meets &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), &quot;Happy Death Day&quot; was a sleeper hit, selling 6.2 million tickets at the box office. It was followed by &quot;Happy Death Day 2U&quot; in 2019, which only had half its predecessor&#x27;s admissions with 3 million tickets sold. &quot;Happy Death Day&quot;&#x27;s director, Christopher Landon, returned for &quot;Freaky&quot; (2020), which mixed &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (2003) with &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980). Starring Kathryn Newton and Vince Vaughn, &quot;Freaky&quot; was released during the COVID-19 Pandemic, becoming a hit on streaming services and received favorable critical reviews. The success of &quot;Happy Death Day&quot; and &quot;Freaky&quot; inspired a wave of high-concept slasher comedies, including &quot;Totally Killer&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Knife&quot; (both 2023).

<doc id="160753" wikidata="Q1503" url="?curid=160753" title="Manuel L. Quezon">
<text>Manuel Luis Quezon y Molina (, , , ; 19 August 1878 – 1 August 1944), also known by his initials MLQ, was a Filipino lawyer, statesman, soldier, and politician who was president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 until his death in 1944. He was the first Filipino to head a government of the entire Philippines and is considered the second president of the Philippines after Emilio Aguinaldo (1899–1901), whom Quezon defeated in the 1935 presidential election. He is often regarded by the public as the greatest president of the Philippines, and the quintessential Filipino statesman. Quezon City, a city in Metro Manila, is named after him. 

During his presidency, Quezon tackled the problem of landless peasants. Other major decisions included the reorganization of the islands&#x27; military defense, approval of a recommendation for government reorganization, the promotion of settlement and development in Mindanao, dealing with the foreign stranglehold on Philippine trade and commerce, proposals for land reform, and opposing graft and corruption within the government. He established a government in exile in the U.S. with the outbreak of World War II and the threat of Japanese invasion. Scholars have described Quezon&#x27;s leadership as a &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; dictatorship&quot; and described him as &quot;the first Filipino politician to integrate all levels of politics into a synergy of power&quot; after removing his term limits as president and turning the Senate into an extension of the executive through constitutional amendments.

In 2015, the Board of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation bestowed a posthumous Wallenberg Medal on Quezon and the people of the Philippines for reaching out to victims of the Holocaust from 1937 to 1941. President Benigno Aquino III and then-94-year-old Maria Zenaida Quezon-Avanceña, the daughter of the former president, were informed of this recognition.

==Early life and education==
Quezon was born on 19 August 1878 in Baler in the district of El Príncipe, then the capital of Nueva Ecija (now Baler, Aurora). His parents were Lucio Quezon y Vélez (1850–1898) and María Dolores Molina (1840–1893). Both were primary-school teachers, although his father was a retired &quot;sargento de Guardia Civil&quot; (sergeant of the Civil Guard).

According to historian Augusto de Viana in his timeline of Baler, Quezon&#x27;s father was a Chinese mestizo who came from the Parián (a Chinatown outside Intramuros) in Paco, Manila. He spoke Spanish in the Civil Guard and married María, who was a Spanish mestiza born of Spanish priest Jose Urbina de Esparragosa; Urbina arrived in Baler from Esparragosa de la Serena, Cáceres Province, Spain in 1847 as the parish priest. Quezon is Chinese mestizo surname originally from a Spanish romanization of Hokkien Chinese, possibly from the Hokkien word, , with meaning &quot;outer city&quot; or &quot;strongest&quot; and meaning &quot;grandson&quot;; many Filipino surnames that end with “on”, “son”, and “zon” are of Chinese origin, Hispanized version of 孫 (&quot;sun&quot;). 

He later boarded at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, where he graduated from secondary school in 1894.
In 1899, Quezon left his law studies at the University of Santo Tomas to join the Filipino war effort, and joined the Republican army during the Philippine–American War. He was an &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Emilio Aguinaldo. Quezon became a major, and fought in the Bataan sector. After surrendering in 1900, he returned to university and passed the bar examination in 1903.

Quezon worked for a time as a clerk and surveyor, entering government service as treasurer for Mindoro and (later) Tayabas. He became a municipal councilor of Lucena, and was elected governor of Tayabas in 1906.

==Congressional career==

===House of Representatives (1907–1916)===
Quezon was elected in 1907 to represent Tayabas&#x27;s 1st district in the first Philippine Assembly (which later became the House of Representatives) during the 1st Philippine Legislature, where he was majority floor leader and chairman of the committees on rules and appropriations. Quezon told the U.S. House of Representatives during a 1914 discussion of the Jones Bill that he received most of his primary education at the village school established by the Spanish government as part of the Philippines&#x27; free public-education system. Months before his term ended, he gave up his seat at the Philippine Assembly upon being appointed as one of the Philippines&#x27; two resident commissioners. Serving two terms from 1909 to 1916, he lobbied for the passage of the Philippine Autonomy Act (the Jones Law).

===Senate (1916–1935)===

Quezon returned to Manila in 1916, and was elected senator from the Fifth Senatorial District. He was later elected Senate President and served continuously until 1935 (19 years), the longest tenure in history until Senator Lorenzo Tañada&#x27;s four consecutive terms (24 years, from 1947 to 1972). Quezon headed the first independent mission to the U.S. Congress in 1919, and secured passage of the Tydings–McDuffie Act in 1934. 

====Rivalry with Osmeña====

In 1921, Quezon made a public campaign against House Speaker Sergio Osmeña accusing him of being an autocratic leader and blamed him for the Philippine National Bank&#x27;s financial mess. Both Osmeña and Quezon debated on this until 1922. As a result, the Nationalista Party was split into two. Quezon also resigned as Senate President that same year in January.

In 1922, he became leader of the Nacionalista Party alliance Partido Nacionalista-Colectivista.

In 1933, both Quezon and Osmeña clashed regarding the ratification of the Hare–Hawes–Cutting bill in the Philippine Legislature.

== Presidency (1935–1944) ==

=== Administration and cabinet ===
===First term (1935–1941)===
In 1935, Quezon won the Philippines&#x27; first national presidential election under the Nacionalista Party. He received nearly 68 percent of the vote against his two main rivals, Emilio Aguinaldo and Gregorio Aglipay. Quezon, inaugurated on November 15, 1935, is recognized as the second President of the Philippines. In January 2008, however, House Representative Rodolfo Valencia (Oriental Mindoro–1st) filed a bill seeking to declare General Miguel Malvar the second Philippine President; Malvar succeeded Aguinaldo in 1901.

==== Supreme Court appointments ====
Under the Reorganization Act, Quezon was given the power to appoint the first all-Filipino cabinet in 1935. From 1901 to 1935, a Filipino was chief justice but most Supreme Court justices were Americans. Complete Filipinization was achieved with the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935. Claro M. Recto and José P. Laurel were among Quezon&#x27;s first appointees to replace the American justices. Membership in the Supreme Court increased to 11: a chief justice and ten associate justices, who sat &quot;en banc&quot; or in two divisions of five members each.

* Ramón Avanceña – 1935 (Chief Justice) – 1935–1941
* José Abad Santos – 1935
* Claro M. Recto – 1935–1936
* José P. Laurel – 1935
* José Abad Santos (Chief Justice) – 1941–1942

====Government reorganization====
To meet the demands of the newly-established government and comply with the Tydings-McDuffie Act and the Constitution, Quezon, true to his pledge of &quot;more government and less politics,&quot;initiated a reorganization of the government. He established a Government Survey Board to study existing institutions and, in light of changed circumstances, make necessary recommendations.

Early results were seen with the revamping of the executive department; offices and bureaus were merged or abolished, and others were created. Quezon ordered the transfer of the Philippine Constabulary from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Finance. Other changes were made to the National Defense, Agriculture and Commerce, Public Works and Communications, and Health and Public Welfare departments.

New offices and boards were created by executive order or legislation. Among these were the Council of National Defense, the Board of National Relief, the Mindanao and Sulu Commission, and the Civil Service Board of Appeals.
====Social-justice program====
Pledging to improve the conditions of the Philippine working class and inspired by the social doctrines of Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius XI and treatises by the world&#x27;s leading sociologists, Quezon began a program of social justice introduced with executive measures and legislation by the National Assembly. A court for industrial relations was established to mediate disputes, minimizing the impact of strikes and lockouts. A minimum-wage law was enacted, as well as a law providing an eight-hour workday and a tenancy law for Filipino farmers. The position of public defender was created to assist the poor.

Commonwealth Act No. 20 enabled Quezon to acquire large, occupied estates to re-appropriate their lots and homes at a nominal cost and under terms affordable by their residents; one example was the Buenavista estate. He also began a cooperative system of agriculture among owners of the subdivided estates to increase their income. Quezon desired to follow the constitutional mandate on the promotion of social justice.

====Economy====
When the Commonwealth was created, its economy was stable and promising. With foreign trade peaking at , the upward trend in business resembled a boom. Export crops were generally good and, except for tobacco, were in high demand. The value of Philippine exports reached , the highest since 1929.

Government revenue in 1936 was , compared to the 1935 revenue of . Government companies, except for the Manila Railroad Company, earned profits. Gold production increased about 37 percent, iron nearly doubled, and cement production increased by about 14 percent.

The government had to address some economic problems, however, and the National Economic Council was created. It advised the government about economic and financial questions, including the promotion of industries, diversification of crops and enterprises, tariffs, taxation, and formulating an economic program in preparation for eventual independence. The National Development Company was reorganized by law, and the National Rice and Corn Company (NARIC) was created with a budget.

Upon the recommendation of the National Economic Council, agricultural colonies were established in Koronadal, Malig, and other locations in Mindanao. The government encouraged migration and settlement in the colonies. The Agricultural and Industrial Bank was established to aid small farmers with convenient loans and affordable terms. Attention was paid to soil surveying and the disposition of public land.

====Land reform====
When the commonwealth government was established, Quezon implemented the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933 to regulate share-tenancy contracts by establishing minimum standards. The act provided a better tenant-landlord relationship, a 50–50 sharing of the crop, regulation of interest at 10 percent per agricultural year, and protected against arbitrary dismissal by the landlord. Because of a major flaw in the act, however, no petition to apply it was ever presented.

The flaw was that it could be used only when the majority of municipal councils in a province petitioned for it. Since landowners usually controlled such councils, no province ever asked that the law be applied. Quezon ordered that the act be mandatory in all Central Luzon provinces. However, contracts were good for only one year; by refusing to renew their contract, landlords could eject tenants. Peasant organizations clamored in vain for a law which would make a contract automatically renewable as long as tenants fulfilled their obligations. The act was amended to eliminate this loophole in 1936, but it was never carried out; by 1939, thousands of peasants in Central Luzon were threatened with eviction. Quezon&#x27;s desire to placate both landlords and tenants pleased neither. Thousands of tenants in Central Luzon were evicted from their farmlands by the early 1940s, and the rural conflict was more acute than ever.

During the Commonwealth period, agrarian problems persisted. This motivated the government to incorporate a social-justice principle into the 1935 Constitution. Dictated by the government&#x27;s social-justice program, expropriation of estates and other landholdings began. The National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) began an orderly settlement of public agricultural lands. At the outbreak of the Second World War, settlement areas covering over had been established.

====Educational reforms====
With his Executive Order No. 19, dated 19 February 1936, Quezon created the National Council of Education. Rafael Palma, former president of the University of the Philippines, was its first chairman. Funds from the early Residence Certificate Law were devoted to maintaining public schools throughout the country and opening many more. There were 6,511 primary schools, 1,039 intermediate schools, 133 secondary and special schools, and five junior colleges by this time. Total enrollment was 1,262,353, with 28,485 teachers. The 1936 appropriation was . Private schools taught over 97,000 students, and the Office of Adult Education was created.

====Women&#x27;s suffrage====
Quezon initiated women&#x27;s suffrage during the Commonwealth era. As a result of prolonged debate between proponents and opponents of women&#x27;s suffrage, the constitution provided that the issue be resolved by women in a plebiscite. If at least 300,000 women voted for the right to vote, it would be granted. The plebiscite was held on 30 April 1937; there were 447,725 affirmative votes, and 44,307 opposition votes.

====National language====
The Philippines&#x27; national language was another constitutional question. After a one-year study, the Institute of National Language recommended that Tagalog be the basis for a national language. The proposal was well-received, despite the fact that director Jaime C. de Veyra was Waray, this is because Baler, Quezon&#x27;s birthplace, is a native Tagalog-speaking area.

In December 1937, Quezon issued a proclamation approving the institute&#x27;s recommendation and declaring that the national language would become effective in two years. With presidential approval, the INL began work on a Tagalog grammar text and dictionary.

====Visits to Japan (1937–1938)====
As Imperial Japan encroached on the Philippines, Quezon antagonized neither the American nor the Japanese officials. He travelled twice to Japan as president, from 31 January to 2 February 1937 and from 29 June to 10 July 1938, to meet with government officials. Quezon emphasized that he would remain loyal to the United States, assuring protection of the rights of the Japanese who resided in the Philippines. Quezon&#x27;s visits may have signalled the Philippines&#x27; inclination to remain neutral in the event of a Japanese-American conflict if the U.S. disregarded the country&#x27;s concerns. 

====Council of State expansion====
In 1938, Quezon expanded the Council of State in Executive Order No. 144. This highest of advisory bodies to the president would be composed of the President, Vice President, Senate President, House Speaker, Senate President pro tempore, House Speaker pro tempore, the majority floor leaders of both chambers of Congress, former presidents, and three to five prominent citizens.

====1938 midterm election====
The elections for the Second National Assembly were held on 8 November 1938 under a new law which allowed block voting and favored the governing Nacionalista Party. As expected, all 98 assembly seats went to the Nacionalistas. José Yulo, Quezon&#x27;s Secretary of Justice from 1934 to 1938, was elected speaker.

The Second National Assembly intended to pass legislation strengthening the economy, but the Second World War clouded the horizon; laws passed by the First National Assembly were modified or repealed to meet existing realities. A controversial immigration law which set an annual limit of 50 immigrants per country, primarily affecting Chinese and Japanese nationals escaping the Sino-Japanese War, was passed in 1940. Since the law affected foreign relations, it required the approval of the U.S. president. When the 1939 census was published, the National Assembly updated the apportionment of legislative districts; this became the basis for the 1941 elections.

====1939 plebiscite====
On 7 August 1939, the United States Congress enacted a law in accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Preparatory Commission on Philippine Affairs. Because the new law required an amendment of the Ordinance appended to the Constitution, a plebiscite was held on 24 August 1939. The amendment received 1,339,453 votes in favor, and 49,633 against.

====Third official language====

Quezon had established the Institute of National Language (INL) to create a national language for the country. On 30 December 1937, in Executive Order No. 134, he declared Tagalog the Philippines&#x27; national language; it was taught in schools during the 1940–1941 academic year. The National Assembly later enacted Law No. 570, making the national language an official language with English and Spanish; this became effective on 4 July 1946, with the establishment of the Philippine Republic.

====1940 plebiscites====
With the 1940 local elections, plebiscites were held for proposed amendments to the constitution about a bicameral legislature, the presidential term (four years, with one re-election, and the establishment of an independent Commission on Elections. The amendments were overwhelmingly ratified. Speaker José Yulo and Assemblyman Dominador Tan traveled to the United States to obtain President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s approval, which they received on 2 December 1940. Two days later, Quezon proclaimed the amendments.

====1941 presidential election====

Quezon was originally barred by the Philippine constitution from seeking re-election. In 1940, however, a constitutional amendment was ratified which allowed him to serve a second term ending in 1943. In the 1941 presidential election, Quezon was re-elected over former Senator Juan Sumulong with nearly 82 percent of the vote. He was inaugurated on December 30, 1941 at the Malinta Tunnel in Corregidor. The oath of office was administered by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines José Abad Santos. Corregidor was chosen as the venue of the inauguration and temporary seat of the government in-exile to take refuge from the uninterrupted Japanese bombing raids during the Japanese invasion.

===Second term (1941–1944)===
====Pre-war activity====
As crises mounted in the Pacific, the Philippines prepared for war. Youth military training under General Douglas MacArthur was intensified. The first blackout practice was held on the night of 10 July 1941 in Manila. First aid was taught in all schools and social clubs. Quezon established the Civilian Emergency Administration (CEA) on 1 April 1941, with branches in provinces and towns. Air-raid drills were also held.

====Jewish refugees====

In cooperation with U.S. High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt, Quezon facilitated the entry into the Philippines of Jewish refugees fleeing fascist regimes in Europe and took on critics who were convinced by propaganda that Jewish settlement was a threat to the country. Quezon and McNutt proposed 30,000 refugee families on Mindanao and 30,000-40,000 refugees on Polillo. Quezon made a 10-year loan to Manila&#x27;s Jewish Refugee Committee of land adjacent to his family home in Marikina to house homeless refugees in Marikina Hall (the present-day Philippine School of Business Administration), which was dedicated on 23 April 1940.

====Government in exile====

After the Japanese invasion of the Philippines during World War II, Quezon evacuated to Corregidor (where he was inaugurated for his second term) and then to the Visayas and Mindanao. At the invitation of the U.S. government, he was evacuated to Australia, and then to the United States. Quezon established the Commonwealth government in exile, with its headquarters in Washington, D.C. He was a member of the Pacific War Council, signed the United Nations declaration against the Axis powers and wrote &quot;The Good Fight&quot;, his autobiography.

To conduct government business in exile, Quezon hired the entire floor of one wing of the Shoreham Hotel to accommodate his family and his office. Government offices were established at the quarters of Philippine Resident Commissioner Joaquin Elizalde, who became a member of Quezon&#x27;s wartime cabinet. Other cabinet appointees were Brigadier-General Carlos P. Romulo as Secretary of the Department of Information and Public Relations and Jaime Hernandez as Auditor General.

Sitting under a canvas canopy outside the Malinta Tunnel on 22 January 1942, Quezon heard a fireside chat during which President Roosevelt said that the Allied forces were determined to defeat Berlin and Rome, followed by Tokyo. Quezon was infuriated, summoned General MacArthur and asked him if the U.S. would support the Philippines; if not, Quezon would return to Manila and allow himself to become a prisoner of war. MacArthur replied that if the Filipinos fighting the Japanese learned that he returned to Manila and became a Japanese puppet, they would consider him a turncoat.

Quezon then heard another broadcast by former president Emilio Aguinaldo urging him and his fellow Filipino officials to yield to superior Japanese forces. Quezon wrote a message to Roosevelt saying that he and his people had been abandoned by the U.S. and it was Quezon&#x27;s duty as president to stop fighting. MacArthur learned about the message, and ordered Major General Richard Marshall to counterbalance it with American propaganda whose purpose was the &quot;glorification of Filipino loyalty and heroism&quot;.

On 2 June 1942, Quezon addressed the United States House of Representatives about the necessity of relieving the Philippine front. He did the same to the Senate, urging the senators to adopt the slogan &quot;Remember Bataan&quot;. Despite his declining health, Quezon traveled across the U.S. to remind the American people about the Philippine war.

====Wartime====
Quezon broadcast a radio message to Philippine residents in Hawaii, who purchased worth of war bonds, for his first birthday celebration in the United States. Indicating the Philippine government&#x27;s cooperation with the war effort, he offered the U.S. Army a Philippine infantry regiment which was authorized by the War Department to train in California. Quezon had the Philippine government acquire Elizalde&#x27;s yacht; renamed &quot;Bataan&quot; and crewed by Philippine officers and sailors, it was donated to the United States for use in the war.

In early November 1942, Quezon conferred with Roosevelt on a plan for a joint commission to study the post-war Philippine economy. Eighteen months later, the United States Congress passed an act creating the Philippine Rehabilitation Commission.

====Quezon-Osmeña impasse====

By 1943, the Philippine government in exile was faced with a crisis. According to the 1935 constitution, Quezon&#x27;s term would expire on 30 December 1943 and Vice-President Sergio Osmeña would succeed him as president. Osmeña wrote to Quezon advising him of this, and Quezon issued a press release and wrote to Osmeña that a change in leadership would be unwise at that time. Osmeña then requested the opinion of U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings, who upheld Osmeña&#x27;s view as consistent with the law. Quezon remained adamant, and sought President Roosevelt&#x27;s decision. Roosevelt remained aloof from the controversy, suggesting that the Philippine officials resolve the impasse.

Quezon convened a cabinet meeting with Osmeña, Resident Commissioner Joaquín Elizalde, Brigadier General Carlos P. Romulo and his cabinet secretaries, Andrés Soriano and Jaime Hernandez. After a discussion, the cabinet supported Elizalde&#x27;s position in favor of the constitution, and Quezon announced his plan to retire in California.

After the meeting, Osmeña approached Quezon and broached his plan to ask the United States Congress to suspend the constitutional provisions for presidential succession until after the Philippines had been liberated; this legal way out was agreeable to Quezon and his cabinet, and steps were taken to carry out the proposal. Sponsored by Senator Tydings and Congressman Bell, the resolution was unanimously approved by the Senate on a voice vote and passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 181 to 107 on 10 November 1943. He was inaugurated for the third time on November 15, 1943 in Washington, D.C. The oath of office was administered by US Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter.

== Death and burial ==

Quezon had developed tuberculosis and spent his last years in hospitals, including a Miami Beach Army hospital in April 1944. That summer, he was at a cure cottage in Saranac Lake, New York. Quezon died there at 10:05 a.m. ET on 1 August 1944, at age 65. His remains were initially buried in Arlington National Cemetery, but his body was brought by former Governor-General and High Commissioner Frank Murphy aboard the and re-interred in the Manila North Cemetery on 17 July 1946. Those were then moved to a miniature copy of Napoleon&#x27;s tomb at the Quezon Memorial Shrine in Quezon City, on 1 August 1979.

A sample of Quezon&#x27;s voice is preserved in a recorded speech, &quot;Message to My People&quot;, which he delivered in English and Spanish. Quezon recorded it while he was President of the Senate &quot;in the 1920s, when he was first diagnosed with tuberculosis and assumed he didn&#x27;t have much longer to live,&quot; according to his grandson Manuel L. Quezon III.

<text>John Blenkinsop (1783 – 22 January 1831) was an English mining engineer and an inventor of steam locomotives, who designed the first practical railway locomotive.

He was born in Felling, County Durham, the son of a stonemason and was apprenticed to his cousin, Thomas Barnes, a Northumberland coal viewer. From 1808 he became agent to Charles John Brandling, who owned collieries on his Middleton estate near Leeds and whose family came from Felling. From then until his death, Blenkinsop lived at Middleton Hall on Town Street, Middleton, built in the 17th century as the Brandling family&#x27;s Middleton home (they used the far more modern Middleton Lodge when visiting from their Tyneside homes).

== Blenkinsop and the Middleton Railway ==
In 1758 the Brandlings had built a wooden wagonway to carry coal into Leeds, using horse-drawn vehicles, now known as the Middleton Railway. Not all the land traversed by the wagonway belonged to Brandling, and it was the first railway to be authorised by Act of Parliament, since this would give him power to obtain wayleave.

In the early nineteenth century, attempts were being made to employ steam power for haulage. Richard Trevithick had experimented with various models of steam locomotive, and in 1805 his work had culminated in an engine for the Wylam Colliery. The cast-iron plated wood rails were unable to take the engine&#x27;s heavy weight, however, and the initial attempt to convert to steam locomotion at Wylam was abandoned. Work on the development of locomotive power continued nonetheless. A shortage of horses and fodder brought about by the Napoleonic Wars had made steam traction a more attractive proposition and encouraged further development. Moreover, edge rails, made entirely of iron, laid at Middleton Railway from around 1799, were stronger.

While many people, such as William Hedley, felt that adhesion should be adequate with a locomotive weighing around five tons, Blenkinsop was less sanguine. In 1811 he patented (No 3431), a rack and pinion system for a locomotive which would be designed and built by Matthew Murray of Fenton, Murray and Wood in Holbeck.

The general opinion of the time was that a locomotive would draw up to four times its weight by adhesion alone (assuming good conditions), but Blenkinsop wanted more, and his engine, weighing five tons, regularly hauled a payload of ninety tons. The first locomotive probably was &quot;Salamanca&quot;, built in early 1812. Three other locomotives followed, one later in 1812, one around 1813, and the last one in 1815. One of these three was named &quot;Lord Wellington&quot;, and the other two allegedly were named &quot;Prince Regent&quot; and &quot;Marquis Wellington&quot;, though there is no contemporary mention of those names. Similar locomotives were built for collieries at Orrell near Wigan by Robert Daglish under licence from Blenkinsop, and at least one other was built by Matthew Murray for the Kenton and Coxlodge Collieries at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. What should have been Blenkinsop&#x27;s third locomotive had already been sent to the Kenton and Coxlodge Waggonway at his request. There, it seems to have acquired the name &quot;Willington&quot;.

Two locomotives of this pattern were also made by the Royal Iron Foundry in Berlin. Though they worked well when tested at the Foundry, neither could be made to work properly at their intended workplaces, and both ended their days as stationary engines. The Murray/Blenkinsop locomotives had the first double-acting cylinders and, unlike the Trevithick pattern, no flywheel. The cylinders drove a geared wheel which engaged with the rack beside one rail. One of the geared locomotives was described as having two 8&quot;x20&quot; cylinders, driving the wheels through cranks. The piston crossheads worked in guides, rather than being controlled by parallel motion like the majority of early locomotives. Between them, the engines saw more than twenty years of service.

The design was superseded when rolled iron rail, which could bear the heavier adhesion locomotives, was introduced in 1820. This was quickly adopted by George Stephenson and others.

In addition to managing the Middleton Collieries, in the 1820s John Blenkinsop was the consulting engineer for Sir John Lister Kaye of Denby Grange, owner of Caphouse Colliery. Also, as a qualified &quot;Viewer&quot;, he was hired by various other colliery owners to examine their collieries and report on such vital matters as the expected future production of a pit, as well as to make suggestions as to how its operation and production could be improved. Blenkinsop died in Leeds in 1831, and is buried at Rothwell Parish Church.

<text>William Hedley (13 July 1779 – 9 January 1843) was born in Newburn, near Newcastle upon Tyne. He was one of the leading industrial engineers of the early 19th century, and was instrumental in several major innovations in early railway development. While working as a &#x27;viewer&#x27; or manager at Wylam Colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne, he built the first practical steam locomotive which relied simply on the adhesion of iron wheels on iron rails.

==Early locomotives==
Before Hedley&#x27;s time, such locomotives were far too heavy for the track that was then available. While most lines used cable haulage with stationary engines, various other schemes had been tried. William Chapman at the Butterley Company in 1812, attempted to use a steam engine which hauled itself along a cable, while, at the same company, Brunton had produced the even less successful &quot;mechanical traveller&quot;, or &quot;Steam Horse&quot;.

However, in 1812, Matthew Murray and John Blenkinsop had produced the first twin cylinder steam locomotive, &quot;Salamanca&quot;, for Middleton Colliery railway near Leeds, using a pinion engaging with teeth along the iron edge rails track (the first rack railway). This had been the first steam locomotive railway to work successfully, but the system was complex and expensive.

==Hedley&#x27;s improvements==

===First locomotive===
Hedley felt that if the pairs of wheels were connected, as with Richard Trevithick&#x27;s engines, if one pair began to slip, it would be counteracted by the other. The mine owner, Christopher Blackett had just replaced the wooden waggonway with iron flanged &#x27;L&#x27; section plate rails. Hedley first constructed a test carriage operated by manpower, to test the adhesion under various loads. He then used it as the chassis for a locomotive constructed to Trevithick&#x27;s pattern with a single cylinder and a simple straight through fire tube to the boiler. This engine was not satisfactory. Its motion was erratic, because of the single cylinder, and it produced insufficient steam.

===&quot;Puffing Billy&quot; and &quot;Wylam Dilly&quot;===
He built a second engine, with the assistance of the, later to be famous, Timothy Hackworth, his foreman smith, and his principal engine wright, Jonathan Forster, using the 1812 twin cylinder plan of John Blenkinsop and Matthew Murray and a return flue boiler. This was the famous steam locomotive, &quot;Puffing Billy&quot; which first ran in 1813 and is now preserved at the Science Museum in London. Its success encouraged them to build a second engine &quot;Wylam Dilly&quot;, which is now in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. In the same year, his system for using a coupling between the wheels was patented.

===Modifications===
However, there was still considerable wear to the track, and the engines were rebuilt using twin four-wheeled bogies, introduced in Blackwell&#x27;s design mentioned above. Initially the wheels were without flanges for use on the flanged plate rails. In about 1830 the line was relaid with the stronger edge rails, and both locomotives reverted to their original pattern, but with flanged wheels, which is how they are today. Both locos remained in active service until 1862.

==Death==
Hedley died in 1843 at Burnhopeside Hall, near Lanchester and was buried at Newburn parish church. Four sons survived him and his descendants remained heavily involved in the coal-mining industry until nationalisation in the 1940s. In 1971, a charitable foundation was set up in the Hedley name, with assets based on the compensation from nationalisation.

<text>Timothy Hackworth (22 December 1786 – 7 July 1850) was an English steam locomotive engineer who lived in Shildon, County Durham, England and was the first locomotive superintendent of the Stockton and Darlington Railway.

== Youth and early work ==
Timothy Hackworth was born in Wylam in 1786, five years after his fellow railway pioneer George Stephenson had been born in the same village. Hackworth was the eldest son of John Hackworth who occupied the position of foreman blacksmith at Wylam Colliery until his death in 1804; the father had already acquired a considerable reputation as a mechanical worker and boiler maker. At the end of his apprenticeship in 1810 Timothy took over his father&#x27;s position. Since 1804, the mine owner, Christopher Blackett had been investigating the possibilities of working the mine&#x27;s short colliery tramroad by steam traction. Blackett set up a four-man working group including himself, William Hedley, the viewer; Timothy Hackworth, the new foreman smith and Jonathan Forster, a &quot;wright&quot;. The first step in 1808 was the relaying of the Wylam tramway with cast iron plates, until then a simple timber-way. In 1811, the four-man team began investigating the adhesive properties of smooth wheels using a manually operated carriage propelled by a maximum of four men, and in the same year a single-cylinder locomotive devised by one Waters, reportedly on the Richard Trevithick model, was built and tried for a few months with erratic results.

In the meantime a new &quot;dilly&quot;, (the term used to designate all locomotives at Wylam), was put in hand and set to work in the autumn of 1812. However even Blackett&#x27;s new cast iron plateway was found inadequate to sustain the weight of a dilly and the subsequent one built in 1813 was carried on two four-wheeled &quot;power bogies&quot; and it is understood that the first one was similarly rebuilt. On the relaying, around 1830, of the Wylam line with wrought iron edge rails, the two locomotives were reverted to the 4-wheel arrangement, continuing to work until the closing of the line in 1862. What is considered to be the earlier of the two engines, now known as &quot;Puffing Billy&quot; is conserved at the Science Museum in London; the second &quot;Wylam Dilly&quot; is in the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh.

Although William Hedley is generally credited with the &quot;design&quot; of the locomotives, there is strong evidence that these issued from the aforementioned joint collaboration in which Christopher Blackett was the driving force with Timothy Hackworth playing a preponderant engineering role. Furthermore, it subsequently fell to Hackworth to maintain the locomotives in running order and improve performance. As time went on, Blackett became increasingly occupied by other outside interests and was often absent, leaving Hedley in charge of the mine; Hackworth found himself in conflictual situations due his Methodist activities and his refusal to work on the Sabbath, until he felt obliged to leave Wylam in 1816.

He was not long in finding other employment at Walbottle Colliery where he took up the same position of foreman blacksmith.

==The &quot;Royal George&quot;==

In 1824, Hackworth occupied a temporary position as a &quot;borrowed man&quot; or relief manager at the Forth Street factory of Robert Stephenson and Company, whilst Robert was away in South America and George was occupied with the surveying of new railways, notably the Liverpool and Manchester. Hackworth only stayed until the end of that year, following which, he returned to Walbottle occupying his time with contract work until, upon the recommendation of George Stephenson, he was appointed on 13 May 1825 to the position of locomotive superintendent of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, a post he was to occupy until May 1840.

Hackworth is believed to have been influential in the development of the first Stephenson locomotive intended for the Stockton and Darlington Railway during his time at the Forth Street factory. That locomotive, then named &quot;Active&quot;, now known as Locomotion No. 1, was delivered to the railway just before the opening ceremony on 27 September 1825. Three more of the same type (&quot;Hope, Black Diamond, Diligence&quot;) were delivered in the following months and difficulties in getting them into operating order were such as to risk compromising the use of steam locomotives for years to come, had it not been for Hackworth&#x27;s persistence. This persistence resulted in his developing the first adequate locomotive adapted to the rigours of everyday road service. The outcome was the &quot;Royal George&quot; of 1827, an early 0-6-0 Locomotive, that among many new key features notably incorporated a correctly aligned steam blastpipe. Hackworth is usually acknowledged as the inventor of this concept. 

From 1830 onwards the blastpipe was employed by the Stephensons for their updated &quot;Rocket&quot; and all subsequent new types. Recent letters acquired by the National Railway Museum would appear to confirm Hackworth as the inventor of the device. Since Trevithick&#x27;s time, it had long been common practice to turn the exhaust steam from the cylinders into the chimney using &quot;eductor pipes&quot; for convenience and noise reduction, and its effect on the fire certainly had been noticed. Whatever the case, Hackworth was probably the first engineer in history to fully take into account the role of the blast in automatically realising the &quot;perfect equilibrium between steam production and usage&quot; in a locomotive when fitted with a firetube boiler, and to consider the blastpipe as a distinct device, paying close attention to its proportions, nozzle size, positioning and precise alignment.

==&quot;Sans Pareil&quot; and the Rainhill trials==
In 1829 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the world&#x27;s first &quot;Inter-City&quot; railway, was under construction. There was a large potential for both passenger and goods traffic. However, all locomotives built to date, including those for the Stockton and Darlington, had been intended for slow freight, with any passenger service handled by single horse-drawn coaches. It was therefore clear that any future locomotives would have to be more versatile. Matters were further complicated by the news about the problems being encountered on the Stockton and Darlington, which gave rise to considerable controversy as to the sort of motive power to be preferred. George Stephenson, the line&#x27;s civil engineer, was unsurprisingly firmly in favour of steam traction and asked for a report from Timothy Hackworth, who confirmed that he was having difficulties but was optimistic about overcoming them. To settle upon a locomotive type the directors set up a competition. The trials were held at Rainhill, and there were three serious contestants. Hackworth, with his own very limited resources, entered the 0-4-0 locomotive, &quot;Sans Pareil&quot;. This locomotive was deemed officially overweight, but nevertheless was allowed to undergo the &quot;ordeal&quot;. Unfortunately faulty cylinder casting led to steam leaks and premature abandonment of the course.

Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot; was the outright winner as the only locomotive that stayed the course whilst fully complying with the rules. In the event, none of the contestants really answered the railway&#x27;s requirements. Hackworth stayed on after the event, repairing the &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; and was able to show that it more than met requirements. On the strength of this, the L&amp;M management did purchase the locomotive, subsequently reselling it at a loss to the Bolton and Leigh Railway where it worked until 1844. As Ahrons points out, the vertical cylinders would have given rise to considerable hammer blow at speed and made it unsuited to passenger service on the track of that time in the long term. Nevertheless, it was a formidable contender, largely due to the carefully designed and tuned blastpipe.

However, the Rainhill trials may be seen as a milestone event, as during the eight days it lasted there were considerable modifications carried out on the three main contestants in which Hackworth participated tirelessly and displayed absolute impartiality. From that date on, locomotive design and performance went forward by leaps and bounds.

==Later productions==
In addition to his duties on the Stockton and Darlington, Hackworth set up his own business in which his son, John Wesley Hackworth, fully participated. This business produced a variety of machinery.

Notably, he built at Shildon in 1836, the first locomotive to run in Russia for the Tsarskoye Selo Railway, of which his son was responsible for the safe delivery and preliminary trials. Also in 1838, the &quot;Samson&quot; was built for the Albion Mines Railway in Nova Scotia, and was one of the first engines to run in Canada.

One of his 1833 apprentices, Daniel Adamson, later further developed his boiler designs and become a successful manufacturer (and influential in the inception of the Manchester Ship Canal).

The last new locomotive design with which Timothy Hackworth was involved was the &quot;Sans Pareil II&quot;, a &quot;demonstrator&quot; of 1849. This locomotive was an advanced 2-2-2 engine of the Jenny Lind type with 6 ft 6 in driving wheel, heating surface and some use of welding in the boiler construction. In performance, it fully lived up to expectations in regards to economy and load-hauling performance. Hackworth was so satisfied that he issued a public challenge to Robert Stephenson to pit his latest York Newcastle and Berwick locomotive, No. 190, against it in a trial. Nothing more was ever heard of this.

==Family==
Hackworth had three sons and six daughters. His eldest son, John Wesley Hackworth (1820–1891), carried on the business after the death of his father. J. W. Hackworth patented the Hackworth valve gear in 1859.

== Legacy ==
Today he has a school named after him in his hometown of Shildon where the pupils annually learn of Timothy Hackworth and his work. His home was also turned into a museum, which has since been renovated and an annexe of the National Railway Museum has been built nearby. The 1839 Hackworth locomotive &quot;Samson&quot; is preserved in Canada at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in Stellarton, Nova Scotia. Hackworth Park in Shildon was named in his honour as was Timothy Hackworth Drive in Darlington.
Hackworth Close (a street in Newthorpe, Nottinghamshire) was also named in his honour.
