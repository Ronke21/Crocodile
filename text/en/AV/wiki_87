<text>Boesenbergia rotunda (, , , ), commonly known as Chinese keys, fingerroot, lesser galangal or Chinese ginger, is a medicinal and culinary herb from China and Southeast Asia. In English, the root has traditionally been called fingerroot, because the shape of the rhizome resembles that of fingers growing out of a center piece.

It has an underground stem, known as a rhizome. This spreads into many bunches in the same way as banana, ginger, galangal and turmeric. These structures accumulate nutrients and the middle part is more swollen than the head and bottom part. The inner part has a range of colours and aromas depending on the variety of fingerroot. The above-ground part is composed of a leaf stalk that has a sheath covering it. The leaf sheaths are red, the blades are oval in shape and the apex of leaves are sharp. Chinese ginger is a herbaceous plant with a height of . The leaf is about long and wide. The middle of the petioles are deeply grooved. The flower appears between the leaf sheaths at the bottom of the trunk. The petals are white or light pink. Flowers bloom one at a time.

==Uses==

In Thai cooking, fingerroot is called &quot;krachai&quot; (; ) and is an ingredient in dishes such as &quot;kaeng tai pla&quot;. It is used in some &quot;kroeung&quot; pastes of Cambodian cuisine and is known as &quot;k&#x27;cheay&quot; (). In the west it is usually found pickled or frozen. The rhizomes are commonly used as vegetables in main dishes or eaten raw when young. It is also used to help make fermented soya bean cake, also called tempeh, a traditional Indonesian food. Its roots and rhizomes are cultivated in Indonesia, Indochina, and India in small homes and is also popularly used in flavorful curry dishes. Fingerroot is also incorporated into tonic mixtures such as the famous Indonesian tonic &quot;jamu&quot;.

It is sometimes confused with &quot;Alpinia officinarum&quot;, another plant in the family Zingiberaceae which is also known as lesser galangal.

<text>From Stump to Ship is an amateur industrial film by Alfred K. Ames, former State Senator and owner of the Machias Lumber Company, in Machias, Maine as well as by Dr. Howard Kane of Washington, DC.

==Summary==
The half-hour 16mm film was shot over the winter of 1930 in the logging woods and shows logging in the forest with hand tools and horses, then moves to the spring log drive, with loggers using peaveys to break up log jams on icy rivers as the logs are moved from the forest to the mill. Detailed views of mill work, changing the bandsaw, and making shingles.

==Production==
Lumber is loaded onto schooners in Machias for transport to New York. The film was originally silent, with a typed script which Ames read aloud when he showed the film. In 1985, with funds from the Maine Humanities Council, the narration was recorded with the film.

The film was distributed by Northeast Historic Film, in Bucksport, Maine. Footage was included in the compilation documentary &quot;Woodsmen and River Drivers, Another Day, Another Era&quot; which also interviewed the surviving woodsmen of the Machias Lumber Company.

==Legacy==
In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan, A Play About a Good Woman is a four-act comedy by Oscar Wilde, first performed on Saturday, 20 February 1892, at the St James&#x27;s Theatre in London.

The story concerns Lady Windermere, who suspects that her husband is having an affair with another woman; she confronts him with it. Although he denies it, he invites the other woman, Mrs Erlynne, to his wife&#x27;s birthday ball. Angered by her husband&#x27;s supposed unfaithfulness, Lady Windermere decides to leave her husband for Lord Darlington, who has recently confessed his love for her. After discovering what has transpired, Mrs Erlynne follows Lady Windermere and attempts to persuade her to return to her husband and in the course of this, Mrs Erlynne lets herself be discovered in a compromising position at Lord Darlington&#x27;s so Lady Windermere has the opportunity to leave without being noticed by Lord Windermere. It is then revealed that Mrs Erlynne is Lady Windermere&#x27;s mother, who abandoned her family twenty years earlier. Mrs Erlynne sacrifices her reputation to save her daughter&#x27;s marriage.

==Composition==
By the summer of 1891 Wilde had already written three plays: &quot;Vera; or, The Nihilists&quot; and &quot;The Duchess of Padua&quot; had found little success, and &quot;Salome&quot; had yet to be staged. Unperturbed, he decided to write another play but turned from tragedy to comedy. He went to the Lake District in the north of England, where he stayed with a friend and later met Robert Ross. Numerous characters in the play appear to draw their names from the north of England: Lady Windermere from the lake and nearby town Windermere (though Wilde had used &quot;Windermere&quot; earlier in &quot;Lord Arthur Savile&#x27;s Crime&quot;), the Duchess of Berwick from Berwick-upon-Tweed, Lord Darlington from Darlington. Wilde began writing the play at the prodding of George Alexander, the actor manager of St James&#x27;s Theatre. The play was finished by October. Alexander liked the play, and offered him an advance of £1,000 for it. Wilde, impressed by his confidence, opted to take a percentage instead, from which he would earn £7,000 in the first year alone (worth £ today).

Alexander was a meticulous manager and he and Wilde began exhaustive revisions and rehearsals of the play. Both were talented artists with strong ideas about their art. Wilde, for instance, emphasised attention to aesthetic minutiae rather than realism; he resisted Alexander&#x27;s suggested broad stage movements, quipping that &quot;Details are of no importance in life, but in art details are vital&quot;. These continued after the opening night when, at the suggestion of both friends and Alexander, Wilde made changes to reveal Mrs Erlynne&#x27;s relationship with Lady Windermere gradually throughout the play, rather than reserving the secret for the final act. Despite these artistic differences, both were professional and their collaboration was a fruitful one.

There is an extant manuscript of the play held in the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library at the University of California, Los Angeles.

==Plot==

===Act I===
The play opens in the morning room of the Windermeres&#x27; residence in London. It is tea time and Lady Windermere—who is preparing for her coming of age birthday ball that evening—has a visit from a friend, Lord Darlington. She shows off her new fan: a present from her husband. She explains to Lord Darlington that she is upset over the compliments he continues to pay to her, revealing that she has very particular views about what is acceptable in society, due in part to her somewhat Puritan upbringing.

The Duchess of Berwick calls and Lord Darlington leaves shortly thereafter. The Duchess informs Lady Windermere that her husband may be betraying her marriage by making repeated visits to another woman, a &quot;Mrs Erlynne&quot;, and possibly giving her large sums of money. These rumours have been gossip among London society for quite a while, though seemingly this is the first Lady Windermere has heard about it.

Following the departure of the Duchess, Lady Windermere decides to check her husband&#x27;s bank book. She finds the book in a desk and sees that nothing appears amiss, though on returning she discovers a second bank book: one with a lock. After prying the lock open, she finds it lists large sums of money given to Mrs Erlynne.

At this point, Lord Windermere enters and she confronts him. Though he cannot deny that he has had dealings with Mrs Erlynne, he states that he is not betraying Lady Windermere. He requests that she send Mrs Erlynne an invitation to her birthday ball that evening to help her back into society. When Lady Windermere refuses, he writes out an invitation himself. Lady Windermere makes clear her intention to cause a scene if Mrs Erlynne appears, to which Lord Windermere responds that it would be in her best interest not to do so.

Lady Windermere leaves in disgust to prepare for the party, and Lord Windermere reveals in soliloquy that he is protecting Mrs Erlynne&#x27;s true identity to save his wife extreme humiliation.

===Act II===
Act II opens in the Windermeres&#x27; drawing room during the birthday ball that evening. Various guests enter, and make small-talk. Lord Windermere enters and asks Lady Windermere to speak with him, but she brushes him off.

A friend of Lord Windermere&#x27;s, Lord Augustus Lorton (&quot;Tuppy&quot;), pulls him aside to inquire about Mrs Erlynne, with whom Tuppy is enamoured. Lord Windermere reveals that there is nothing untoward in his relationship with Mrs Erlynne, and that she will be attending the ball, which comes as a great relief to Lord Augustus as he was worried about her social standing.

After an unsuccessful attempt to make peace with his wife, Lord Windermere summons the courage to tell the truth to her, but at that moment Mrs Erlynne arrives at the party, where she is greeted coldly by Lady Windermere, spoiling his plan.

Alone, Lady Windermere and Lord Darlington discuss Mrs Erlynne&#x27;s attendance. Lady Windermere is enraged and confused and asks Lord Darlington to be her friend. Instead of friendship, Lord Darlington takes advantage of Lady Windermere&#x27;s tragic state and professes his love to her, offering her his life, and inviting her to risk short-term social humiliation for a new life with him. Lord Darlington sets her an ultimatum to try to convince her to take action immediately, while still in a state of shock. Lady Windermere is shocked by the revelation, and finds she does not have the courage to take the offer. Heartbroken, Lord Darlington announces that he will be leaving the country the next day and that they will never meet again, and leaves.

The guests begin to leave, and say their goodnights to Lady Windermere—some remarking positively about Mrs Erlynne. On the other side of the room Mrs Erlynne is discussing her plans with Lord Windermere; she intends to marry Lord Augustus and will require some money from Lord Windermere.

Later, Lady Windermere, in spite of her earlier reluctance, decides to depart the house at once for Lord Darlington, and leaves a note to that effect for Lord Windermere. Mrs Erlynne discovers the note and that Lady Windermere has gone, and is curiously worried by this revelation. While reading the note, a brief monologue reveals that she is in fact Lady Windermere&#x27;s mother and made a similar mistake herself twenty years previously. She takes the letter and exits to locate Lady Windermere.

===Act III===
Lady Windermere is alone in Lord Darlington&#x27;s rooms, unsure if she has made the right decision. Eventually she resolves to return to her husband, but then Mrs Erlynne appears. Despite Mrs Erlynne&#x27;s honest attempts to persuade her to return home to her husband, Lady Windermere is convinced her appearance is part of some plot conceived by her and Lord Windermere. Mrs Erlynne finally breaks Lady Windermere&#x27;s resistance by imploring her to return for the sake of her young child, but as they begin to exit they hear Lord Darlington entering with friends. The two women hide.

The men—who include Lord Windermere and Lord Augustus—have been evicted from their gentlemen&#x27;s club at closing time and talk about women: mainly Mrs Erlynne. One of them takes notice of a fan lying on a table (Lady Windermere&#x27;s) and presumes that Lord Darlington presently has a woman visiting. As Lord Windermere rises to leave, the fan is pointed out to him, which he instantly recognises as his wife&#x27;s. He demands to know if Lord Darlington has her hidden somewhere. Lord Darlington refuses to cooperate, believing that Lady Windermere has come to him. Just as Lord Windermere is about to discover Lady Windermere&#x27;s hiding place, Mrs Erlynne reveals herself instead, shocking all the men and allowing Lady Windermere to slip away unnoticed.

===Act IV===
The next day, Lady Windermere is lying on the couch of the morning room anxious about whether to tell her husband what actually happened, or whether Mrs Erlynne will have already betrayed her secret. Her husband enters. He is sympathetic towards her and suggests that as the London season is almost over that they head to their country estate to forget the recent incident. Lady Windermere apologises for her previous suspicion of her husband and behaviour at the party, and Lord Windermere makes clear his new contempt for Mrs Erlynne—warning his wife to stay away from her.

Mrs Erlynne&#x27;s arrival is announced along with the return of the fan, and despite her husband&#x27;s protestations, Lady Windermere insists on seeing her. Mrs Erlynne enters and states that she shall be going abroad, but asks that Lady Windermere give her a photograph of herself and her son.

Whilst Lady Windermere leaves the room to find one, the story is revealed: Mrs Erlynne left her husband for a lover shortly after Lady Windermere&#x27;s birth. When her new lover abandoned her, Mrs Erlynne was left alone and in disrepute. More recently, using the assumed name of Mrs Erlynne, she has begun blackmailing Lord Windermere to regain her lifestyle and status, by threatening to reveal her true identity as Lady Windermere&#x27;s shameful mother—not dead, as Lady Windermere believes. Her son-in-law, Lord Windermere laments not having told his wife the whole story at once and resolves to tell her the truth now. Mrs Erlynne forbids him to do so, threatening to spread shame far and wide if he does.

Lady Windermere returns with the photograph which she presents to Mrs Erlynne, and requests that Lord Windermere check for the return of Mrs Erlynne&#x27;s coach. Now that they are alone, and being owed a favour, Mrs Erlynne demands that Lady Windermere not reveal the truth about the events of the previous night to Lord Windermere, and Lady Windermere promises to keep the secret.

After Lord Windermere&#x27;s return, Lord Augustus enters. He is shocked to see Mrs Erlynne after the events of the night before, but she requests his company as she heads to her carriage, and he soon returns to the Windermeres with news that she has satisfactorily explained the events of the evening, and that they are to marry and live out of England.

Their marriage is restored, but both Lord and Lady Windermere keep their secrets.

==Productions==

===Premiere===

The premiere at the St James&#x27;s Theatre was followed by a famous speech by Wilde. When Wilde answered the calls of &quot;Author!&quot; and appeared before the curtains after the third act, critics were more offended by the cigarette in his hand than his ironically egotistic speech:

Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening &quot;immensely&quot;. The actors have given us a &quot;charming&quot; rendering of a &quot;delightful&quot; play, and your appreciation has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the &quot;great&quot; success of your performance, which persuades me that you think &quot;almost&quot; as highly of the play as I do myself.
Mrs Erlynne was originated by Marion Terry, and Lady Windermere by Lily Hanbury, who was succeeded after a few performances by Winifred Emery. The play&#x27;s Broadway première on 5 February 1893 at Palmer&#x27;s Theatre was also the first Broadway performance for stage and screen actress Julia Arthur, who played Lady Windermere in that production.

==Themes==
By showing in St. James&#x27;s, Wilde was targeting a fashionable, upper-middle class audience and Wilde maps out the geography of their world, Grosvenor Square, Curzon Street, the park, with precision. Peter Raby has also highlighted &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; as a good example of Wilde&#x27;s most successful dramatic technique: the juxtaposition of the comic and the serious. &quot;Once the absurd and the patently false have been established, the serious emotions and ideas which are explored have been given a setting which prevents them from ever becoming too serious&quot;.

Scholar Paul Fortunato describes Oscar Wilde as a modernist, who used his modern aesthetics so as to direct him into the realm of mass culture. Wilde&#x27;s huge popularity as a playwright began with his production of &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, his recherché attitude and personal aesthetics reflected in his writing. Fortunato elaborates on the facets of his aestheticism—an aestheticism that distorts and lies on the surface, rejects any notion of an authentic self, and centres on the female aesthete and woman of fashion. As he describes, understanding Wilde as a modernist through his writing of &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; can help us understand the disparity between mass culture and high society. Wilde bridges this by theorising his modern aesthetics beneath the ornamental surface of fashion and elite society. The fan that strings together the play&#x27;s scenes simultaneously evokes a traditional symbol of modesty while revealing a truly modern current of infidelity.

<text>Aozora Bunko (, , also known as the &quot;Open Air Library&quot;) is a Japanese digital library. This online collection encompasses several thousand works of Japanese-language fiction and non-fiction. These include out-of-copyright books or works that the authors wish to make freely available.

Since its inception, in 1997, Aozora Bunko has been both the compiler and publisher of an evolving online catalog. In 2006, Aozora Bunko organized to add a role as a public policy advocate to protect its current and anticipated catalog of freely accessible e-books.

==History and operation==
Aozora Bunko was created on the Internet in 1997 to provide broadly available, free access to Japanese literary works whose copyrights had expired. The driving force behind the project was Michio Tomita (富田 倫生, 1952–2013), who was motivated by the belief that people with a common interest should cooperate with each other.

In Japan, Aozora Bunko is considered similar to Project Gutenberg. Most of the texts provided are Japanese literature, and some translations from English literature. The resources are searchable by category, author, or title; and there is a considerable amount of support on how to use the database in the form of detailed explanations. The files can be downloaded in PDF format or simply viewed in HTML format.

After the passing of Tomita in 2013, the was established independently to assist funding and operations for Aozora Bunko.

Aozora Bunko currently includes more than 15,100 works .

==Public policy advocacy==

Aozora Bunko joined with others in organizing to oppose changes to the Japanese copyright law. That opposition has led to encouraging Japanese citizens to submit letters and petitions to the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs and to members of the Japanese Diet.

Japan and other countries accepted the terms of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, an 1886 international agreement about common copyright policies. Aozora Bunko adopted an advocacy role in favor of continuing with the &quot;status quo,&quot; wherein laws do not go beyond the minimum copyright terms of the Berne Convention. These laws have copyrights that run for the lifetime of the author plus 50 years, which Aozora Bunko believes is preferable to changes proposed by a number of influential groups pushing for longer copyright terms.

The evolution of Aozora Bunko from a digital library to a public policy advocacy organization was an unintended consequence which developed only after the perceived threat to the Aozora Bunko catalog and mission became otherwise unavoidable.

==Problems==

Aozora Bunko pointed that extension of the copyright term had been influenced from the document titled &quot;The U.S.–Japan Regulatory Reform and Competition Policy Initiative.&quot; Through these annual reports, the U.S. Government was requiring that the protected period of copyright should be extended to the Japanese government: 70 years after one&#x27;s death for a work by an individual, and 95 years after publication for a work by a corporation. In response, the Agency for Cultural Affairs in Japan has expressed that a conclusion will be obtained at the Council for Cultural Affairs copyright subcommittee by the end of 2007. If the legal revision which extends the protected period of copyright will be actually carried out, Aozora Bunko would be forced not to publish books which have already or almost already been published, due to the 20 years extension of the protection of copyright. Therefore, Aozora Bunko released a counter declaration against enforcement of the revised law on 1 January 2005, and they started to collect the signatures for a petition on 1 January 2007.

Due to the regime change in 2009 in Japan, Japanese government stopped receiving these reports from the U.S. government. Aozora Bunko did not show any responses toward that and their petition calling for opposition against the extension of copyright term stopped from the modification of October 2008. Instead of the document, the website of the Office of the United States Trade Representative inserted the &quot;UNITED STATES–JAPAN ECONOMIC HARMONIZATION INITIATIVE&quot; in February 2011. In the document, the U.S. government promoted the extension of copyright law for protection of intellectual property rights toward Japanese government so that it was &quot;in line with emerging global trends, including those of its OECD counterparts and major trading partners.&quot;

On 30 December 2018, Japan did extend the period to 70 years, which was a requirement stemming from the EU–Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.

<text>Melody Ranch is a 1940 Western musical film directed by Joseph Santley and starring Gene Autry, Jimmy Durante, and Ann Miller. Written by Jack Moffitt, F. Hugh Herbert, Bradford Ropes, and Betty Burbridge, the film is about a singing cowboy who returns to his hometown to restore order when his former childhood enemies take over the frontier town. In 2002, the film was added to the National Film Registry by the National Film Preservation Board and selected for preservation as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
Gene Autry returns to his hometown of Torpedo as guest of honor at the Frontier Days Celebration, where he meets his childhood enemies, the Wildhack brothers—Mark, Jasper, and Bud—who are now local gangsters. The Wildhacks own a saloon next door to the school, and when their shooting and brawling endangers the safety of the children, Gene protests and threatens to expose them during his next radio broadcast. The Wildhacks stop the broadcast and beat Gene up.

Realizing that Hollywood life has softened him to the extent that he can&#x27;t hold his own against three assailants, Gene decides to remain in Torpedo and get into shape again. He is encouraged by his friend Cornelius J. &quot;Corney&quot; Courtney and Pop Laramie. Refusing to return to Hollywood, Gene now broadcasts his radio shows from Torpedo.

Julie Sheldon, a debutante with theatrical aspirations, sees Gene in his natural setting and begins to take an interest in the cowboy she formerly scorned. Meanwhile, Gene rounds up the Wildhacks and fights them single-handed, forcing them to sing on his broadcast. When the brothers become determined to get revenge, Gene runs for sheriff so he will be in position to clean up the Wildhack political machine for good, and also make use of the &quot;Vote for Autry&quot; song. During the battles that ensue, one of Gene&#x27;s friends is killed. Gene discovers evidence that identifies the Wildhacks as the killers.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Casting===
&quot;Melody Ranch&quot; marks the first romantic leading lady role for dancer Ann Miller. In one love scene Miller and Autry kiss. Negative advance publicity, however, led Republic Pictures to cut the kiss from the final print. Autry later recalled, 
 Miller would later claim incorrectly that she received Gene&#x27;s first screen kiss, a distinction that belongs to Barbara Pepper and Ann Rutherford.

===Filming and budget===
&quot;Melody Ranch&quot; was filmed September 16 to October 5, 1940. The film had an operating budget of $181,275 (equal to $ today), and a negative cost of $177,520.

<text>The Pearl is a novella by the American author John Steinbeck. The story, first published in 1947, follows a pearl diver, Kino, and explores man’s purpose as well as greed, defiance of societal norms, and evil. Steinbeck&#x27;s inspiration was a Mexican folk tale from La Paz, Baja California Sur, which he had heard in a visit to the formerly pearl-rich region in 1940.

The book was adapted as a Mexican film named &quot;La Perla&quot; (1947) and as a cult Kannada movie &quot;Ondu Muttina Kathe&quot; (1987). The story is one of Steinbeck&#x27;s most popular books and has been widely used in middle and high school classes. &quot;The Pearl&quot; is sometimes considered a parable.

== Plot ==

Kino, a poor pearl fisherman, lives with his wife Juana and their infant son Coyotito in La Paz, Baja California Sur. Kino sees a scorpion crawl down one of the ropes holding up the hanging box that serves as Coyotito&#x27;s crib and tries to remove it. However, Coyotito shakes the rope, causing the scorpion to fall into the box and sting him. Kino and Juana visit the local doctor but are turned away because of their poverty and his prejudices toward Amerindians.

As Juana applies a seaweed poultice to the sting, Kino dives for oysters from his canoe, hoping to find a pearl valuable enough to cover the treatment fee. One oyster yields an immense pearl, which he calls &quot;The Pearl of the World&quot;; news of its discovery spreads quickly, and some of the family&#x27;s neighbors start to resent Kino&#x27;s luck in finding it. Unaware of these reactions, Kino envisions selling the pearl and using the money to improve his family&#x27;s lives. The doctor visits them to treat Coyotito, even though the baby seems to be recovering, and Kino promises to pay him after selling the pearl. 

That night, Kino drives off a thief who attempts to break into his house. Juana warns him that the pearl will destroy the family, but Kino insists that it is their only chance for a better life. He goes to sell it the next day, not knowing that all the pearl dealers in La Paz are working for a single buyer and conspiring to keep prices low. Pretending that Kino&#x27;s pearl is of poor quality, they make offers of 1,500 pesos at most; he angrily rejects them, believing the pearl to be worth 50,000 pesos, and vows to sell it in the capital instead. 

More thieves attack Kino that night, but he remains resolved to make the journey despite Juana&#x27;s warning that the pearl is evil and her suggestions to get rid of it. After Kino forcibly stops her from throwing it into the ocean, he is attacked again; Kino kills one man in self-defense, and he and Juana hurriedly flee with Coyotito to avoid any reprisals. Discovering that Kino&#x27;s canoe has been damaged and their house looted and burned in search of the pearl, the family takes refuge with Kino&#x27;s brother and his wife before setting out for the capital the following night.

As they travel, Kino spots a trio of men following them and Juana realizes that they are trackers intending to take the pearl and kill the entire family. Leaving the road they have been using, Kino leads Juana into the mountains in order to leave fewer signs of their passage. They take shelter in a cave, only for the trackers to make camp by a pool of water below them. Kino decides to attack the trio that night, viewing it as the only way they can stop the pursuers for good. As Kino sneaks down the cliff, one of the trackers hears a cry and fires his rifle in its direction, thinking it to be a coyote pup. Kino kills all three men, then discovers that the shot has killed Coyotito.

Kino and Juana return to La Paz with their son&#x27;s body. After looking at the pearl one last time and seeing its surface reflect images of all the disasters that have befallen him and his family, Kino throws it into the ocean.

== Setting ==
Steinbeck began writing the story as a movie script in 1944 and first published it as a short story called &quot;The Pearl of the World&quot; in the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; (December 1945). The original publication is also sometimes listed as &quot;The Pearl of La Paz&quot;. Steinbeck expanded the story to novella length and published it under the name &quot;The Pearl&quot; (1947), published by Viking Press. As he was writing the novella version, he was frequently travelling to Mexico where the film version, co-written with Jack Wagner, was being filmed. The film was also released by RKO in 1947 as a co-promotion with the book.

In 2001, &quot;The Pearl&quot; was loosely adapted as a film directed by Alfredo Zacharias, starring Lukas Haas and Richard Harris, which was released directly to video in 2005.

The book takes place in La Paz, Baja California, Mexico. Unlike many of Steinbeck’s other works, it does not take place in the U.S state of California.

==Themes==
Family – One of the major themes in the novel is family. Throughout the novel, the plot discusses how the family lives before and after the pearl. It is the constant focus of the plot and many of the decisions are based on what would be best for the family. For example, the first thing that Kino desires to do with the money from the pearl is to give his wife and Coyotito a better life. This money would pay for Coyotito’s education, better clothes, and better protection. Later, Kino also demonstrates devotion to his family by not selling to the pearl dealer. The second buyer was trying to get the pearl for less than it was worth, but Kino, with his family in mind, declined to search for a better deal. He always has his family in mind, whether it leads to warmth and happiness or destruction. It was the reason Kino got the pearl and, eventually, the reason why he threw it back into the ocean.

Good and Evil – One of the major themes in this novel is the one between good and evil. Steinbeck complicates these simple notions of good and bad by showing how evil can come in beautiful or prestigious packages like the Doctor, the Priest, or even in the end, the Pearl of the World. 

Kino often hears a refrain of music, a device Steinbeck uses to offer the reader insight into the inner world of the characters and the emotional crux of each scene. Kino hears the music of evil first associated with the Western Doctor who only comes to help Coyotito&#x27;s scorpion bite after he hears that Kino has found the Pearl. The Doctor lies to Kino by saying the baby is still sick when the narrator has told us that Coyotito is on the mend. At this moment, Kino is confused when he hears the music of evil because he wants to believe and look up to the Doctor, but the Doctor, like the other false friends he meets in town, are trying to take advantage of him. 

Colonialism – While the story is presented as a fable with a simple moral at the end, seemingly to warn readers of being greedy or defying the gods by trying to change their station, the underlying message is a critique of the systemic economic and societal disparity between the indigenous community of which Kino and Juana are a part and the wealthier colonial settlers of the fictional La Paz, the neighboring city in Baja Mexico. Steinbeck portrays Kino and Juana as eager to gain access to the medicine and education of the colonial population after getting rejected by the local Doctor. Once they find the pearl, they are willing to take great risks to give Coyotito access so that he might improve his station and gain knowledge from the world beyond their indigenous traditions. However, throughout the story, we see that the people in power in the city of plaster are well-placed to maintain their position of wealth and power by lying and conspiring against Kino and Juana when they come to the city to sell the pearl. 

Paradox – The theme of paradox is displayed through Kino’s desires. Once Kino discovers the pearl, he begins to dream about what could come from this fortune as greed fills his head, but as he tries to carry out this plan, the good wealth also brings destruction to his family as he treats Juana poorly and is abusive. Though Kino desires good for his family, there is a paradox of an evil reality that he does not want. Kino tries to “avoid life’s inevitable tension” between these two but he finds that he cannot separate the good and the evil. In the end, the finding of the great prize causes him to lose another, his son.

Perseverance – The theme of perseverance is demonstrated by many characters, but mainly Kino. Before he found the pearl, he was a noble and a very determined person who sought fortune for his family. After he finds it, he is hoping to find it in a different way. Because Kino believes that this would save his family, he persists “though many obstacles” that accompany the pearl. He perseveres to keep the pearl but, in the end, it was not worth keeping.

==Characters==
Kino is a hard-working pearl-diver and the protagonist of the novella. He has a wife, Juana, and a son, Coyotito. He is content with his lifestyle as a diver and possesses nothing of value until he discovers the pearl. After finding the pearl, Kino gradually changes to become a completely different man. Though his family is still the center of his actions, he is also driven by his dreams of an escape from their poverty and a desire to give his son a better future. He quickly becomes obsessed with the material things that the pearl could bring. He is no longer content with his son being uneducated, or his family not being well-dressed. Instead of enjoying his family and their company, as he did in the beginning, he becomes discontent and always seeks more. He is also driven by his desire not to be cheated or slighted. Kino is named for the missionary Eusebio Kino.

Juana, Kino’s wife, is a secondary character. She is a loving woman who cares for her husband and son. Throughout the experience, she remains loyal to her family but also perceives the evil forces that the valuable pearl attracts. For example, two nights after the pearl is found, she attempts to throw it back into the ocean to bring back peace and happiness to her family.

Coyotito is Juana and Kino’s infant son. He is their only child, and his parents do everything they can to protect him. Despite his parents’ love and effort, he is subject to much harm, both before and after the pearl is found. Coyotito is shot and killed by one of the pearl hunters.

The Doctor, unnamed in the novella, is a symbol of wealth, greed and exploitation. He is repulsive, fat, and also foreign-born, a native of France. Before the pearl is found, he refuses to heal Coyotito because the family is poor, though it would be easy for him to do so. After Kino finds the pearl, he personally visits the family at home, acting much friendlier than at their first meeting and even pretending to heal Coyotito&#x27;s scorpion sting with ammonia. During the doctor&#x27;s visit, he tries to determine from Kino&#x27;s glances where in the house the pearl may be hidden, though Kino is too suspicious to reveal anything. The doctor&#x27;s behavioral changes foreshadow the more serious troubles that begin after Kino&#x27;s discovery of the pearl.

Juan Tomas, Kino’s brother, is wise and loyal. He is the only other character in the book to suspect the manipulation undertaken by the pearl dealers. When destruction does come, Juan Tomas does not turn away his brother but, instead, welcomes him in and protects him. He is one of the few characters that does not seek to gain from the pearl and shows he values the importance of family ties.

Apolonia is the wife of Juan Tomas who helps his brother in protecting and hiding Kino.

The pearl dealers, like the doctor, symbolize the exploitation of the native population, this time by the organized pearl-dealing cartel for which the dealers work. When Kino tries to sell the pearl, the pearl dealers claim that the pearl&#x27;s size makes it worthless and offer Kino a fraction of the pearl&#x27;s true worth. Kino&#x27;s outrage at their barehanded lies causes him to brave the dangerous trip to the capital and seek a better price.

The thieves and trackers are shadowy figures who attack Kino from the first night he has the pearl. Kino never recognizes who they are. They harass and then follow the family right to the end of the story. They force Kino to fight and kill to defend himself and his family and keep the pearl his own. In the final scenes, in which Kino is tracked by a posse, it is not clear in the text whether the group are thieves or law enforcement officers hunting Kino for his killing of the man on the beach.

== Reception and analysis ==

Several publications praised the novel as a &quot;major artistic triumph&quot; and emphasizes how Steinbeck understands &quot;the universal significance of life.&quot; The Pearl is often used to teach students about literature and is also used to discuss important lessons about life. Many believe the book is the easiest of Steinbeck&#x27;s books to teach because the lessons are simple, yet significant, so, generally, students in middle school or early high school study this novel. Teachers instruct their students to delve deeper than surface level to learn about both the simplicity and complexity of the novel and emphasize its themes to allow students to learn more than just literacy.

Jackson Benson writes, &quot;The Pearl&quot; was heavily influenced by Steinbeck&#x27;s interest in the philosophy of Carl Jung. Steinbeck wrote that he created the story of &quot;The Pearl&quot; to address the themes of &quot;human greed, materialism, and the inherent worth of a thing.&quot;

==Influences==

Joshua Kadison&#x27;s 1995 song &quot;The Pearl” is based on this story. Kino and Juana&#x27;s names are changed to Zandro and Maya in this version.

Fleming and John&#x27;s 1999 song &quot;The Pearl&quot; is based on this story.

The American composer Andrew Boysen&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Trombone and Wind Symphony&quot; (2004) was inspired by &quot;The Pearl&quot;.

<text>Punch Drunks is a 1934 short subject directed by Lou Breslow starring American slapstick comedy team The Three Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Jerry Howard). It is the second entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 short subjects for the studio between 1934 and 1959.

In 2002, &quot;Punch Drunks&quot; became the first and only Stooge film to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Moe, a struggling boxing manager, finds himself embroiled in a tumultuous lunchtime confrontation with his disgruntled fighters, who threaten to abandon him due to unpaid wages. A serendipitous turn of events unfolds as strolling violinist Larry unwittingly triggers a violent outburst from the timid waiter, Curly, upon playing the melody of &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;. Seizing upon this unexpected display of physical prowess, Moe swiftly enlists Curly as a boxer and engages Larry to play the titular tune during Curly&#x27;s matches, enabling him to effortlessly defeat opponents and secure prize money.

As Curly undergoes rigorous training under Moe&#x27;s guidance, a chance encounter with a stranded female motorist interrupts their routine. Despite Moe&#x27;s admonition against entanglements with women, Curly aids the young lady, propelled by the musical accompaniment provided by Larry.

Adopting the moniker &quot;K.O. Stradivarius,&quot; Curly ascends to prominence in the boxing arena, positioning himself as the leading contender for the heavyweight championship. However, on the eve of the title match, Moe discovers Curly in the company of the lady, prompting a stern reprimand and a directive to focus solely on the impending bout.

The championship showdown ensues, with reigning titleholder Killer Kilduff asserting his dominance by swiftly dispatching Curly from the ring, causing devastation to Larry&#x27;s violin in the process. Desperate to revive Curly&#x27;s fighting spirit, Larry embarks on a frantic quest to procure an alternative means of playing the tune. Amidst the tumult of the bout, Larry&#x27;s resourcefulness prevails as he secures a radio broadcasting the melody, revitalizing Curly&#x27;s resolve.

However, just as Curly gains momentum, the radio abruptly shifts its broadcast, interrupting the crucial musical accompaniment and tilting the scales in Kilduff&#x27;s favor once more. Frustration mounts as Moe and Larry scramble to restore the melody, resorting to unconventional methods in their pursuit.

Ultimately, Larry commandeers a politician&#x27;s campaign truck equipped with the desired tune, crashing into the arena to deliver the decisive musical aid. Empowered by the restored melody, Curly rallies to secure victory, claiming the championship title.

==Production and significance==
The script for &quot;Punch Drunks&quot; was written by the Stooges, credited as &quot;Jerry Howard, Larry Fine, and Moe Howard&quot;. According to Moe, the initial treatment of the script was originated by him; on its strength, the studio decided to produce the Stooges&#x27; next film sooner than scheduled. Filming was completed May 2–5, 1934.

In 2002, &quot;Punch Drunks&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, the only Stooge film to achieve such an honor.

==Notes==

*&quot;Punch Drunks&quot; was originally titled &quot;A Symphony of Punches&quot; but was changed before its release. The title &quot;Punch Drunks&quot; comes from the expression &quot;punch drunk&quot;, referring to any fighter who has been hit so many times he is unsteady on his feet. &quot;Punch Drunks&quot; was remade with Shemp Howard in 1945 as &quot;A Hit with a Miss&quot;. The plot device of gaining uncontrollable strength after hearing &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot; was reworked with Joe DeRita in the Stooges&#x27; 1963 feature film &quot;The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze&quot;.
*A colorized version of this film was released in 2004 as part of the DVD collection &quot;Goofs on the Loose&quot;.
*The short is notable as being one of the few in which the Stooges are not an established trio at the beginning of the film.
*Curly&#x27;s first &quot;woo-woo-woo!&quot;, done when Larry first plays &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;, ended up being reused as a stock overdub in several future Stooge shorts featuring Curly.
*This is the first film in which Curly calls himself a &quot;victim of soycumstance!&quot; (circumstance): this comment would become one of Curly&#x27;s catch-phrases.
*When the Stooges are taking part in Curly&#x27;s first workout as a boxer (rowing down the street), Larry is playing a tune on his violin that sounds akin to &quot;Let&#x27;s Fall in Love&quot;, a song sung 23 years later by the character Tiny (Muriel Landers) in the Stooge film &quot;Sweet and Hot&quot;. Larry plays the song before he loses his balance and falls, causing Moe to push him backwards, ending up in a shallow lake. Larry, who has hidden behind the door of the dressing room, suddenly appears, attempting to play a snippet of the same song, later on in the film for the young lady in the dressing room before Moe angrily uses a bucket of water to put on his head, to tell him to go upstairs to the arena.
*Character actor Charles King, who played the man standing on the back of the truck, broke his leg during the fall.
*The short ends with the playing of the song &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;, which would become the opening theme for the short &quot;Pop Goes the Easel&quot;.
*This is the first of several films in which a normally passive Curly sees, hears, or smells something that triggers a violent reaction from him. The idea would be reused in &quot;Horses&#x27; Collars&quot;, &quot;Grips, Grunts and Groans&quot;, and &quot;Tassels in the Air&quot;.
*The boxing option in &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; video game is based on this short.
*This was also the first of 9 shorts that featured Larry Fine playing his violin.
*Over the course of their 24 years at Columbia Pictures, the Stooges were occasionally cast as separate characters, with this being one such occurrence (the boys start out in separate roles and end up working together).
*During the fight, when Larry is seen running down the street, Curly&#x27;s voice can be heard in the distance saying, &quot;Run! All the way!&quot; After a few seconds, he also says ‘Then come back!’ This happens twice in the film. This was a mistake in production and was left in.
*As the referee is introducing challenger Curly, an audience member gestures obscenely at the camera.
*Larry&#x27;s running down the street is sped up for comic effect, with postproduction sounds of rapid footsteps added. His frantic driving of the van, with its speakers booming out &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot; (the same recording as on the radio earlier), is also sped up.
*This film features a rare scene in which Moe smacks someone other than one of his two pals; as several people begin to rub Curly down after a rather painful round of boxing and accidentally pull Moe into it, he slaps one of them in the back of the head.
*The opening title music, &quot;I Thought I Wanted You,&quot; composed by Archie Gottler (who directed the previous Stooge film, &quot;Woman Haters&quot;) and Edward Eliscu, is unique to this and next Stooge film, &quot;Men in Black&quot;.
* Originally, the song &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; was going to be used, but the producer did not want to pay royalties, so the song &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot; was selected because it was in the public domain.
*A snippet of &quot;Punch Drunks&quot; appears in the Eddie Murphy comedy &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot;.
*The Stooges receive &quot;story&quot; credit for the short, with Curly credited under his real name; they did not actually write the script. The story was submitted by Moe, and he added Larry and Curly&#x27;s names in consideration of his partners. The &quot;screenplay&quot; was written by Jack Cluett.
* One repeated gag occurs when Moe sees a young boy in the audience and asks for a piece of hard candy so that he could throw it at the bell, causing it to ring and stop the fight, saving Curly by the bell. The kid repeatedly does the throwing, thus keeping Curly in the ring.

<text>Felicia Dorothea Hemans (25 September 1793 – 16 May 1835) was an English poet (who identified as Welsh by adoption). Regarded as the leading female poet of her day, Hemans was immensely popular during her lifetime in both England and the United States, and was second only to Lord Byron in terms of sales. 

Two of her opening lines, &quot;The boy stood on the burning deck&quot; and &quot;The stately homes of England&quot;, have acquired classic status.

==Early life and education==

Felicia Dorothea Browne was the daughter of George Browne, who worked for his father-in-law&#x27;s wine importing business and succeeded him as Tuscan and imperial consul in Liverpool, and Felicity, daughter of Benedict Paul Wagner (1718–1806), wine importer at 9 Wolstenholme Square, Liverpool and Venetian consul for that city. Hemans was the fourth of six children (three boys and three girls) to survive infancy. Her sister Harriet collaborated musically with Hemans and later edited her complete works (7 vols. with memoir, 1839). George Browne&#x27;s business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They lived in a cottage within the grounds of Gwrych Castle near Abergele when Felicia was seven years old until she was sixteen and in 1809 moved to Bronwylfa, St. Asaph (Flintshire). She later called Wales &quot;Land of my childhood, my home and my dead&quot;. Lydia Sigourney says of her education: 

The nature of the education of Mrs. Hemans, was favourable to the development of her genius. A wide range of classical and poetical studies, with the acquisition of several languages, supplied both pleasant aliment and needful discipline. She required not the excitement of a more public system of culture,—for the never-resting love of knowledge was her school master.

Hemans was proficient in Welsh, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. Her sister Harriet remarked that &quot;One of her earliest tastes was a passion for Shakspeare, which she read, as her choicest recreation, at six years old.&quot;

==Career==
Hemans&#x27; first poems, dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was fourteen, arousing the interest of poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who briefly corresponded with her. She quickly followed them up with &quot;England and Spain&quot; (1808), politically addressing the Peninsular War, and &quot;The Domestic Affections&quot; (1812). In contrast to its title, which Hemans did not choose, many of the book&#x27;s poems explore issues of patriotism and war, this was published on the eve to her marriage to captain Alfred Hemans.
Between 1821 and 1823, she started to study German. Her favourite German poet was Theodor Körner.

On December 12, 1823, her &#x27;Vespers of Palermo&#x27; works was reenacted as a play at Covent garden, the leading actors were; Welsh actor Charles Kemble and English actor Charles Mayne Young, for this, she received £200 for the copyright (£20,000 in 2024 after inflation). The play was a failure and any other planned shows were cancelled. The following year, the show was put on again at Edinburgh with greater success with Harriet Siddons reciting the epilogue written by Sir Walter Scott (who became Felicia&#x27;s cordial friend), an alteration which was requested by Joanna Baillie. 

Hemans&#x27; major collections, including &quot;The Forest Sanctuary&quot; (Which started in 1824 and published in 1825), &quot;Records of Woman&quot; and &quot;Songs of the Affections&quot; (1830) were highly popular. Hemans published many of her pieces in magazines first, enabling her to remain in the public eye and adapt to her audience, as well as earning additional income. Many of her pieces were used for schoolroom recitations and collections were presented as school prizes, especially to female readers.

Her last books, published in 1834, were &quot;Scenes and Hymns of Life&quot; and &quot;National Lyrics, and Songs for Music&quot;. It has been suggested that her late religious poetry, like her early political poetry, marks her entry into an area of dispute that was both public and male-dominated.

At the time of her death in 1835, Hemans was a well-known literary figure, highly regarded by contemporaries, and with a popular following in the United States and the United Kingdom. Both Hemans and Wordsworth were identified with ideas of cultural domesticity that shaped the Victorian era.

==Personal life==
On 30 July 1812, Felicia Browne married Captain Alfred Hemans, an Irish army officer some years older than herself. The marriage took her away from Wales, to Daventry in Northamptonshire (where Alfred was an adjutant of the Northamptonshire militia) until 1814, the year her father died at Québec on a business trip. During their first six years of marriage, Hemans gave birth to five sons, including G. W. Hemans and Charles Isidore Hemans, and then the couple separated. Marriage had not, however, prevented her from continuing her literary career. Several volumes of poetry were published by the respected firm of John Murray in the period after 1816, beginning with &quot;The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy&quot; (1816) and &quot;Modern Greece&quot; (1817). The collection &quot;Tales and Historic Scenes&quot; came out in 1819, which she was awarded £50 (equivalent to ~£3,600 in 2024) for the best poem on &quot;The Meeting of Wallace and Bruce on the Banks of the Carron&quot;, this year would also be Hemans&#x27; separation. 
In 1821 Felicia the Royal Society of Literature awarded her for the best poem on the subject of Dartmoor, to which, she began on her play, The Vespers of Palermo.

In 1825, one of Felicia&#x27;s brothers purchased her home at Bronwylfa and she moved to Rhyllon near the River Clwyd, her time there would the most tranquil period of her life. After she left this address, it appears that her sister; Harriet Mary Owen moved into Rhyllon with her husband; Rev William HIcks Owen (who was the correspondent for the Earl of Powis). 

One of the reasons why Hemans was able to write prolifically as a single parent, was that many of the domestic duties of running a household were taken over by her mother, with whom she and her children lived. It was a financial necessity for Hemans to write to support herself, her mother, and the children. On 11 January 1827, Hemans&#x27; mother died, leading to the breaking up of the household and her mental state. Whilst pregnant to her fifth child, Hemans sent her two oldest sons to Rome to join their father, and moved to a suburb of Liverpool with her younger sons. Felicia and Alfred continued to exchange letters with one another, in these letters they often consulted about their children.


From 1831, Hemans lived in Dublin, which was recommended as healthier than Liverpool. Despite the change, she continued to experience poor health. She died on 16 May 1835. Sources suggest that she had suffered from an attack of scarlet fever, followed by a &quot;consumptive decline&quot;, or by &quot;dropsy&quot;. She may have experienced rheumatic fever and heart problems as well as circulatory problems. She was buried in St. Ann&#x27;s Church, Dawson Street, Dublin. William Wordsworth mentioned her in a memorial stanza, and Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Lydia Huntley Sigourney, and Walter Savage Landor composed memorial verses in her honour. Lydia Huntley Sigourney also wrote a memoir to preface an American edition of Hemans&#x27; collected works.


==Legacy==

Hemans&#x27;s works appeared in nineteen individual books during her lifetime, publishing first with John Murray and later with Blackwoods. After her death in 1835, her works were republished widely, usually as collections of individual lyrics and not the longer, annotated works and integrated series that made up her books. For surviving female poets, such as Caroline Norton, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Lydia Sigourney and Frances Harper, the French Amable Tastu and German Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, she was a valued model. To many readers she offered a woman&#x27;s voice confiding a woman&#x27;s trials; to others, a lyricism consonant with Victorian sentimentality and patriotism. In her most successful book, &quot;Records of Woman&quot; (1828), she chronicles the lives of women, both famous and anonymous. Portraying examples of heroism, rebellion, and resistance, she connects womanhood with &quot;affection&#x27;s might&quot;. Among the works she valued most were the unfinished &quot;Superstition and Revelation&quot; and the pamphlet &quot;The Sceptic,&quot; which sought an Anglicanism more attuned to world religions and women&#x27;s experiences.

Hemans&#x27; poem &quot;The Homes of England&quot; (1827) is the origin of the phrase &quot;stately home&quot;, referring to an English country house.

Despite her illustrious admirers her stature as a serious poet gradually declined, partly due to her success in the literary marketplace. Her poetry was considered morally exemplary, and was often assigned to schoolchildren; as a result, Hemans came to be seen as more a poet for children rather than a serious author. Schoolchildren in the U.S. were still being taught &quot;The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers in New England&quot; in the middle of the 20th century. But by the 21st century, &quot;The Stately Homes of England&quot; refers to Noël Coward&#x27;s parody, not to the once-famous poem it parodied.

With the rise in women&#x27;s studies, Hemans&#x27; critical reputation has been re-examined. Her work has resumed a role in standard anthologies and in classrooms and seminars and literary studies, especially in the US. Anthologised poems include &quot;The Image in Lava,&quot; &quot;Evening Prayer at a Girls&#x27; School,&quot; &quot;I Dream of All Things Free&quot;, &quot;Night-Blowing Flowers&quot;, &quot;Properzia Rossi&quot;, &quot;A Spirit&#x27;s Return&quot;, &quot;The Bride of the Greek Isle&quot;, &quot;The Wife of Asdrubal&quot;, &quot;The Widow of Crescentius&quot;, &quot;The Last Song of Sappho&quot;, &quot;Corinne at the Capitol&quot; and &quot;The Coronation of Inez De Castro&quot;.

==&quot;Casabianca&quot;==
First published in August 1826 the poem &quot;Casabianca&quot; (also known as &quot;The Boy stood on the Burning Deck&quot;) by Hemans depicts Captain Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca and his 12-year-old son, Giocante, who both perished aboard the ship &quot;Orient&quot; during the Battle of the Nile. The poem was very popular from the 1850s on and was memorized in elementary schools for literary practice. Other poetic figures such as Elizabeth Bishop and Samuel Butler allude to the poem in their own works.

&quot;&#x27;Speak, Father!&#x27; once again he cried / &#x27;If I may yet be gone! / And&#x27;—but the booming shots replied / And fast the flames rolled on.&quot;

The poem is sung in ballad form (abab) and consists of a boy asking his father whether he had fulfilled his duties, as the ship continues to burn until the magazine catches fire. Hemans adds the following note to the poem: &#x27;Young Casabianca, a boy about thirteen years old, son to the Admiral of the &quot;Orient&quot;, remained at his post (in the Battle of the Nile) after the ship had taken fire, and all the guns had been abandoned, and perished in the explosion of the vessel, when the flames had reached the powder.&#x27;

Martin Gardner included Casabianca in his collection of &quot;Best Remembered Poems&quot;, along with a childhood parody. Michael R. Turner included it among the &quot;improving gems&quot; of his 1967 &quot;Parlour Poetry&quot;. Others wrote modern-day parodies that were much more upbeat and consisted of boys stuffing their faces with peanuts and bread. These contrast sharply with the dramatic image created in Hemans&#x27; Casabianca.

==&quot;England and Spain, or, Valour and Patriotism&quot;==
Her second book, &quot;England and Spain, or, Valour and Patriotism&quot;, was published in 1808 and was a narrative poem honouring her brother and his military service in the Peninsular War. The poem called for an end to the tyranny of Napoleon Bonaparte and for a long-lasting peace. Multiple references to Albion, an older name for Great Britain, emphasize Hemans&#x27;s patriotism.

&quot;For this thy noble sons have spread alarms, and bade the zones resound with BRITAIN&#x27;s arms!&quot;

==Female suicide in Hemans&#x27; works==

Several of Hemans&#x27;s characters take their own lives rather than suffer the social, political and personal consequences of their compromised situations. At Hemans&#x27;s time, women writers were often torn between a choice of home or the pursuit of a literary career. Hemans herself was able to balance both roles without much public ridicule, but left hints of discontent through the themes of feminine death in her writing. The suicides of women in Hemans&#x27;s poetry dwell on the same social issue that was confronted both culturally and personally during her life: the choice of caged domestication or freedom of thought and expression.

&quot;The Bride of the Greek Isle&quot;, &quot;The Sicilian Captive&quot;, &quot;The Last Song of Sappho&quot; and &quot;Indian Woman&#x27;s Death Song&quot; are some of the most notable of Hemans&#x27; works involving women&#x27;s suicides. Each poem portrays a heroine who is untimely torn from her home by a masculine force – such as pirates, Vikings, and unrequited lovers – and forced to make the decision to accept her new confines or command control over the situation. None of the heroines are complacent with the tragedies that befall them, and the women ultimately take their own lives in either a final grasp for power and expression or a means to escape victimisation.

<text>Star Theatre (also known as Demolishing and Building Up the Star Theatre) is a 1901 short documentary film in which time-lapse photography is used to show the dismantling and demolition of New York City&#x27;s Star Theatre over a period of about a month.

Produced by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company (often shortened to Biograph), it was filmed by F.S. Armitage. In 2002, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in its National Film Registry.

== Production ==
Formerly called Wallack&#x27;s Theatre, the Star Theatre was located across the street from Biograph&#x27;s offices on Thirteenth Street and Broadway in New York City, New York. Taking advantage of his view from his office, Armitage set up a camera and used &quot;a specifically devised electric apparatus&quot; to shoot every four minutes, eight hours a day. He also shot about thirty seconds of standard exposures at the beginning and end of the demolition process to set and close the scene.

Biograph publicists encouraged exhibitors to show the film advancing regularly and in reverse, adding &quot;The effect is very extraordinary.&quot;

<text>Doritos () is an American brand of flavored tortilla chips produced by Frito-Lay, a wholly owned subsidiary of PepsiCo. The concept for Doritos originated at Disneyland at a restaurant managed by Frito-Lay.

In 1966, Doritos became the first tortilla chip available nationally in the United States. The initial flavor was simply toasted corn, followed by taco in 1967, and the now-ubiquitous nacho cheese in 1972. Now, the chips are available worldwide in a wide variety of flavors, differing regionally.

Doritos has also gained notability for its marketing campaigns, including ads aired during Super Bowls. The Doritos brand is also used for similarly-seasoned products, like Doritos 3D and taco shells at Taco Bell.

== History ==

The term &quot;dorito&quot; is a contraction of Spanish &quot;doradito&quot; (little fried and golden thing), which is a diminutive of &quot;dorado&quot; (fried and golden thing).

The original product was made at the Casa de Fritos (now Rancho Del Zocalo) at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, during the early 1960s. Using surplus tortillas and , the company-owned restaurant cut them into smaller pieces, fried them, and added basic seasoning. Arch West was the vice president of marketing of Frito-Lay at the time, and noticed their popularity. He made a deal in 1964 with Alex Foods, the provider of many items for Casa de Fritos at Disneyland, and produced the chips for a short time regionally, before it was overwhelmed by the volume, and Frito-Lay moved the production in-house to its Tulsa plant.

Doritos were released nationwide in 1966, the first tortilla chip to be launched nationally in the United States.

According to Information Resources International, in 1993, Doritos earned $1.2 billion in retail sales, one-third of the total Frito-Lay sales for the year.

The company was sued in 1993 by Charles Grady, who claimed that his throat had been damaged while eating Doritos. According to his lawsuit, the shape and rigidity of the chips made them inherently dangerous. Grady attempted to admit into evidence a study by a former chemistry professor that calculated how best to safely swallow the chips. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court later ruled that the study did not meet scientific standards and could not be presented as evidence.

In the costliest redesign in Frito-Lay history, in 1994 the company spent $50 million to redesign Doritos. Roger J. Berdusco, the vice president of tortilla chip marketing, said a primary reason for the change was &quot;greater competition from restaurant-style tortilla chips, that are larger and more strongly seasoned&quot;. The design change was the result of a two-year market research study that involved 5,000 chip eaters. The new design made the chips 20% larger, 15% thinner, and gave each chip rounded corners, making it easier to eat and reducing the scrap resulting from broken corners. Each chip was also given more seasoning, resulting in a stronger flavor. The redesigned chips were released in four flavors beginning in January 1995.

In the United States, Frito-Lay eliminated trans fat from all Doritos varieties in 2002. The same year, the Doritos brand began complying with U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling regulations, four years before the regulations became mandatory.

In 2005, sales of Doritos in the United States fell by 1.7% to $595 million. To increase sales in 2006, the company launched several new flavors, a new label, and more bilingual advertising. Frito-Lay vice president Joe Ennen described this as &quot;the most significant rebranding and relaunch in Doritos&#x27; 38-year history.&quot;

On February 21, 2013, the &quot;Doritos&quot; logo was changed again, and the advertising slogan &quot;for the bold&quot; was adopted.

In 2015, Doritos introduced a limited edition Rainbow Doritos product, which were only available to those making a minimum donation of $10 to the It Gets Better Project, a non-profit organization that supports LGBT youth. The promotion raised $100,000 for the organization, despite some controversy.

==Ingredients==
The original plain chips (Toasted Corn, a discontinued US variety as of 2019, but available in the UK branded as &#x27;Lightly Salted&#x27;) are made of ground corn (maize), vegetable oil, and salt. Other ingredients vary across the flavored chip varieties. Doritos made for the US market generally do not use pork-derived animal rennet in the making of the cheese flavorings used on the chip.
* Nacho Cheese Doritos ingredients (U.S.), in order of percent of product: whole corn, vegetable oil (corn, soybean, and/or sunflower oil), salt, cheddar cheese (milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes), maltodextrin, whey, monosodium glutamate, buttermilk solids, romano cheese (part skim cow&#x27;s milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes), whey protein concentrate, onion powder, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, corn flour, disodium phosphate, lactose, natural and artificial flavor, dextrose, tomato powder, spices, lactic acid, artificial color (including Yellow 6, Yellow 5, Red 40), citric acid, sugar, garlic powder, red and green bell pepper powder, sodium caseinate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, nonfat milk solids, whey protein isolate, corn syrup solids.

In 1996, &quot;The Onion&quot;, a satirical newspaper and website, featured an article with the headline &quot;Doritos Celebrates One Millionth Ingredient&quot;, lampooning Frito-Lay for the sheer number of ingredients found in Doritos.

Concerns have been raised that the oils, flavorings and additives used in Doritos and other Frito-Lay products may be unhealthy.

==Flavors==
Doritos are sold in many countries worldwide in assorted flavors. They launched nationally in the United States in 1966, with only one flavor: Toasted Corn. The product proved successful, but additional market research revealed that many consumers outside the Southwest and West considered the chip to be too bland and not spicy enough for what was perceived as a Mexican snack. Frito-Lay therefore developed taco-flavored Doritos, which also became successful after they were introduced nationally in 1967. National distribution of nacho cheese-flavored Doritos began in 1972, and they were also a hit. In 1978, Sour Cream and Onion flavored Doritos were introduced, but were discontinued in the early 1980s. A Sesame seed flavored chip was also available for a short time during 1978-79. Around 1985, the original taco flavor recipe was altered to include a sour cream flavoring. In 1986, Cool Ranch Doritos made their debut and also became popular. Cool Ranch Doritos are sold under the name &quot;Cool Original&quot; in the UK and are called &quot;Cool American&quot; elsewhere in Europe, as ranch dressing is less common in those places.

In the 1990s, in partnership with parent company PepsiCo&#x27;s fast food brands, two new flavors of Doritos were introduced, Taco Bell&#x27;s Taco Supreme (incorporating a &quot;beef&quot; flavoring that was quite different from the original 1960s &quot;Taco&quot; incarnation) and Pizza Hut&#x27;s Pizza Cravers. After PepsiCo spun off its restaurant division in 1997, the flavors were simply renamed taco and pizza, respectively, with the pizza flavor discontinued in some markets. At around the same time, due to the popularity of Frito-Lay&#x27;s Tostitos brand the unflavored Toasted Corn was briefly discontinued, then brought back. In 2008, the Taco Bell (complete with the brand name attached) flavor was temporarily re-released under the &quot;Back by Popular Demand&quot; label along with Four Cheese.

In 1990, Jumpin&#x27; Jack Monterey Cheese flavored Doritos were introduced. This flavor was later discontinued. In 1995, Chester&#x27;s Cheese Doritos were available for a limited time. This flavor introduced the familiar Cheetos flavor cheese on the typical Doritos tortilla chip. In 1997, Spicy Nacho was introduced.

For a brief period in 2004, Doritos introduced new shape and form called &quot;Rollitos&quot;, which were corn chips shaped into small tubes, like a regular triangular Dorito was &quot;rolled&quot; up. Rollitos flavors included Nacho Cheesier, Zesty Taco, Cooler Ranch and Queso Picante. In 2013, this idea was reintroduced and rebranded as &quot;Dinamitas&quot;, or little sticks of dynamite. There are two varieties, a chili lime combo (similar to Takis Fuego), and the Mojo Criollo (Creole magic), a lemon-lime and garlic flavored rolled Doritos. Dinamitas differs slightly in style than Rollitos. Rollitos had the chips baked, the tube formed with an oil-submersible box press to fry. Currently it is rolled into a tube before the baking and frying, a much simpler process.

Six versions of &quot;Doritos Collisions&quot;, which include two different flavors in the same bag, have been produced. Those varieties of Doritos Collisions are Hot Wings/Blue Cheese, Zesty Taco/Chipotle Ranch, Habanero/Guacamole, Cheesy Enchilada/Sour Cream, Pizza Cravers/Ranch, and Blaze/Ultimate Cheddar.

In 2007, Doritos ran a campaign called &quot;Doritos X-13D Flavor Experiment&quot; where black, unidentified bags of Doritos were on the market for consumers to identify and name the flavor. The only flavor identification on these chips was &quot;All American Classic&quot;.
Reincarnations and relaunches of taco-flavored Doritos, including the 2008 &quot;Back By Popular Demand&quot; campaign, were different from the original taco flavor (a sour cream flavor had been added to the recipe around 1985). The taco chips included in the Zesty Taco and Chipotle Ranch &quot;Collisions&quot; bags were thought by customers to be closer to the original, but were later discontinued in most of the United States. In late 2010, the modified taco flavor recipe introduced in the mid 1980s returned in a limited edition &quot;retro&quot; styled bag incorporating the original Doritos logo, and in early 2011, Frito-Lay announced that this incarnation would remain in the permanent product line-up.

In 2008, Doritos debuted a &quot;mystery flavor&quot; Quests with prizes being given as puzzles were solved. The mystery flavor was Mountain Dew. In 2009, Doritos released some new flavors under the banner &quot;Doritos Late Night&quot;: &quot;Tacos at Midnight&quot; and &quot;Last Call Jalapeño Popper&quot;. They also modified the X-13D Flavor as All Nighter Cheeseburger.

2010 saw the release of three successively spicy &quot;Degree Burn&quot; flavors (Blazin&#x27; Jalapeño/Jalapeño Fire, Fiery Buffalo and Scorchin&#x27; Habanero), cross promoted to &quot;cool down&quot; with Pepsi&#x27;s lime &quot;Cease Fire/Max Citrus Freeze&quot;, and the wasabi-flavored Mr. Dragon&#x27;s Fire Chips. 2010 saw the introduction of Doritos to New Zealand and with it flavors including Nacho Cheese, Cheese Supreme, Salted, and Salsa.

In the spring of 2011, a Tapatio hot sauce flavor was released. In February 2011, Doritos Canada ran a competition to write the end of a commercial for two new flavors (&quot;Onion Rings n&#x27; Ketchup&quot; and &quot;Blazin&#x27; Buffalo and Ranch&quot;), and to vote for which of the two flavors would be taken off shelves when the contest ended. Onion Rings n&#x27; Ketchup received the most votes and remained on sale.

In the spring of 2015, Doritos Roulette was released to US markets for a limited time. It later returned to store shelves on April 12, 2021. While all chips appeared to look the same on the outside, one out of every six chips would be extra spicy. Owing to the spicy nature of one variety contained in the pack, in July 2015, George Pindar School reported an incident where an asthmatic student &quot;suffered some difficulty breathing after eating one&quot;.

On October 6, 2022, Doritos launched two new flavors in the UK inspired by the nation&#x27;s favorite pizzas, &quot;Triple Cheese Pizza&quot; and &quot;Loaded Pepperoni Pizza&quot; flavors were launched and added to the range.

==Marketing==
The brand&#x27;s marketing campaigns have included many television commercials featuring Avery Schreiber, Jay Leno, and Ali Landry, as well as product placement in movies, such as &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;.

===Super Bowl===
For many years, Doritos advertised heavily during the Super Bowl. According to Thomas L. Harris&#x27;s &quot;Value-Added Public Relations&quot;, &quot;the most-used single video news release of 1995&quot; was a Doritos Super Bowl Commercial featuring recently defeated US state governors Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards. The pair were discussing change and the ad ended with viewers aware that the change they referred to was not political, but rather a new packaging for Doritos. The ad generated a great deal of publicity before it ever ran and much discussion afterward. The governors later parodied their ad; when they were interviewed on the CBS news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, the two were often seen eating Doritos.

In 1998, Doritos cast former Miss USA Ali Landry in a new Super Bowl Commercial. In the ad, filmed in a Laundromat, she plays a sexy customer who catches Doritos chips in her mouth as they come flying helter-skelter. The ad was such a success that Frito-Lay signed Landry, who became known as &quot;The Doritos Girl,&quot; to a three-year contract.

For Super Bowl XLI, Doritos launched a contest, Crash the Super Bowl, to allow consumers to create their own Doritos commercial. The general public was allowed to vote for their favorite of five finalists. According to Doritos, the vote was so close that just before the game the company decided to run two of the ads rather than just one. Both commercials finished highly in ratings of commercials during this Super Bowl. The following year, Doritos sponsored a contest to find a musician to feature in a Super Bowl ad. Although the ad, featuring winner Kina Grannis, generated a lot of publicity, it ranked last in popularity among the program&#x27;s ads.

For Super Bowl XLIII, Doritos relaunched the fan-created commercials, with the winning vote going to the &quot;Free Doritos&quot; ad, which featured an office worker (portrayed by comedian Steve Booth) with a snow globe (believing it to be a crystal ball) &quot;predicting&quot; that everyone in the office would get free Doritos, then subsequently throws the snow globe into a vending machine selling nothing but Nacho Cheese &amp; Cool Ranch Doritos. The commercial was ranked by the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter as the best ad for the year, earning the creators of the ad – Joe and Dave Herbert – a $1 million prize. They again aired two ads during the game ads and the second place ad also placed in the top five according to USA Today. This ad featured a man who discovers that each crunch from his bag of Doritos causes whatever is on his mind to become reality (until he runs out of chips). Another popular commercial from the group of finalist included an executive making a presentation to other executives on a new (fictional) Doritos flavor called &quot;Doritos Beer&quot;, which, as the name implies, is beer-flavored Doritos, with each chip containing as much alcohol as an equivalent of a 16-oz. can of beer. The executive making the presentation, eating the beer-flavored chips, ends up drunk on the chips and is down to his underwear and a tie by the end of the commercial. For Super Bowl XLIV, four ads were entered, and if three of the commercials swept the top three positions in that year&#x27;s Ad Meter contest, all of the creators would be awarded a total of $5 million, broken down as $1 million for first place, $600,000 for second and $400,000 for third, plus each maker would get an additional $1 million.

For the Super Bowl XLIII as aired in Canada, Doritos aired the &quot;Chip Hat&quot; commercial advertising their new &quot;unidentified flavor&quot; chip flavor that offers a prize of CDN $25,000 + 1% of all associated sales to someone that can both name, and create an ad for the new flavor. The new winning name, Scream Cheese (or, in French, Fromage Fracassant), was submitted by Ryan Coopersmith of Montreal.

For the Super Bowl XLIV Doritos aired the &quot;House Rules&quot; commercial, as a &quot;Crash the Super Bowl&quot; finalist. It was ranked by ADBOWL as the second best ad of the year.

For Super Bowl XLVI, an ad aired featuring a Grandma and a baby attempting to get a bag of Doritos by a slingshot activated by a wheelchair. The bag was stolen by a child, constantly teasing them in the process. The baby reaches the bag and steals it back with just enough force to reach it. Flattering the child, Grandma and the baby eat the Doritos with ease.

For Super Bowl XLIX, the ad featured a father offering a large bag of Doritos to his son only if he made pigs fly. The son then proceeded to attach rockets to a pig and the father then gave the bag of Doritos to his son.

===Other===
In 2008, Doritos were promoted by an &quot;out-of-this-world&quot; advertising campaign, literally beaming a 30-second advertisement for Doritos brand tortilla chips into a planetary system 42 light years away. The project was in collaboration with EISCAT Space Center in Svalbard, Norway. The &quot;You Make It, We&#x27;ll Play It&quot; contest chose the winning advertisement that was transmitted on June 12, 2008. The ad was beamed towards 47 Ursae Majoris, a distant star within the Ursa Major constellation that is orbited by planets which may harbor life.

Doritos was the main sponsor of Wolverhampton Wanderers for the 2002/03 and 2003/04 seasons, the latter of which was spent in the Premier League. Doritos officially sponsored the &quot;Hail to the Cheese Stephen Colbert&#x27;s Nacho Cheese Doritos 2008 Presidential Campaign Coverage.&quot; The money given to Colbert could not be used to directly fund his campaign, so he used the money to fund &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. He claimed that he would not use his show to plug Doritos, but plugged the chips during these claims. After the campaign flopped, Colbert joked that his &quot;body will stop producing bright orange waste.&quot; In March 2008, Colbert partnered with Doritos, specifically the Spicy Sweet Chili flavor, to promote his Philadelphia-based coverage of the Pennsylvania primaries.

In 2010, Doritos Canada launched a &quot;Viralocity&quot; competition, asking the public to name a new flavor and to produce an online video advertising the fictional new flavor. Natalie Armstrong submitted her video, and before long she received the most points based on numerous factors, including most widely viewed, winning a cash prize.

In 2010, Doritos launched for the first time in New Zealand with Nacho Cheese, Cheese Supreme, Salsa, and Salted flavors. It replaced the long-running CC&#x27;s brand.

On September 20, 2011, retired Frito-Lay marketing executive Arch West, who was credited for creating Doritos as the first national tortilla chip brand, died in Dallas at age 97. It is said that corporate response showed little enthusiasm to the tortilla chip idea, but more marketing research led to the Doritos release.

To coincide with the 50th anniversary of Taco Bell, Doritos and Taco Bell partnered to form the Doritos Locos Tacos, introduced on March 8, 2012. The taco is a standard Crunchy Taco. The taco comes either as a Doritos Locos Taco Supreme (ground beef, lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, and sour cream), or a Regular Doritos Locos Taco (ground beef, lettuce, and shredded cheese), but the taco shell is made out of Nacho Cheese Doritos. From 1978 to 1997, both Taco Bell and Doritos were under the same corporate umbrella within PepsiCo until PepsiCo spun off its restaurant business into what would eventually become what is now Yum! Brands.

In March 2012, a new line of Doritos were introduced: Doritos Jacked. The chips are 40% larger than standard Doritos.

In March 2013, Doritos redesigned its packaging and logo as part of its first global marketing campaign. The &quot;For the Bold&quot; campaign will use crowdsourcing initiatives from 37 countries, emphasizing Dorito&#x27;s focus on its consumers &quot;living for the moment&quot; attitude. The campaign kicked off at the South by Southwest Music Conference.

In April 2013, Doritos released Doritos Locos Chips with Nacho Cheese and Cool Ranch to match Taco Bells campaign.
In July 2014, 7-11 released a new snack called Doritos Loaded. The breaded cheese snack was released by PepsiCo&#x27;s as its first frozen food product, also available in grocery stores.

Current flavors of Doritos (as of November 2014) marketed in Canada are Nacho Cheese, Zesty Cheese, Cool Ranch, Spicy Nacho, Jalapeño Cheddar, Intense Pickle, Roulette (Nacho Cheese with 1 in 7 chips being hot) and Sweet Chili Heat. Brief stints of Jacked, Taco, Guacamole, Locos Nacho (taco and nacho), Locos Cool Ranch (taco and cool ranch) and Ketchup have been introduced with Guacamole lined to make a return in early 2015. Doritos Roasted Corn, Tapatio Hot Sauce, and Salsa Verde are also popular American flavors. Other Lines of Doritos are Doritos Jacked flavors such as Buffalo Wings and Spicy Street Taco and the Dinamita flavor lines shaped in tubes. Dinamita come in flavors such as Chile Limon, Nacho Picoso, and Spicy Habanero flavors.

In January 2017, Doritos entered the Indonesian market. Flavors of Doritos marketed in Indonesia include Nacho Cheese, Barbecue and Roasted Corn, both of which are distributed by Indofood. It was initially imported from Saudi Arabia. As of late 2017, it is currently produced locally by Indofood Fritolay Makmur (currently Indofood Fortuna Makmur) at its factory in Tangerang, Indonesia. In September 2021, the brand of Doritos in Indonesia was renamed to Maxicorn because the license agreement between Indofood Fritolay Makmur and PepsiCo had ended.

==Doritos 3D==
Doritos 3D is a line of puffed Doritos originally introduced in 1998 and discontinued in the United States in 2004. These snacks have been described as &quot;Doritos-meets-Bugles&quot;. Flavors included Jalapeño Cheddar, Nacho Cheese and Zesty Ranch. The Doritos 3D line of puffed Doritos is still sold in Mexico. On December 21, 2020, it was announced that Doritos 3D would be returning to shelves on December 28. The snack is now available in Chili Cheese Nacho and Spicy Ranch flavors.

<doc id="165366" wikidata="Q1345409" url="?curid=165366" title="Stranger Than Paradise">
<text>Stranger Than Paradise is a 1984 American black-and-white absurdist deadpan comedy film directed, co-written and co-edited by Jim Jarmusch, and starring jazz musician John Lurie, former Sonic Youth drummer-turned-actor Richard Edson, and Hungarian-born actress and violinist Eszter Balint. It features a minimalist plot in which the main character, Willie, is visited by Eva, his cousin from Hungary. Eva stays with him for ten days before going to Cleveland. Willie and his friend Eddie go to Cleveland to visit her, and the three then take a trip to Florida. The film is shot entirely in single long takes with no standard coverage.

==Plot==
The film is a three-act story about Willie, who lives in Brooklyn, and his interactions with the two other main characters, his cousin Eva and friend Eddie.

In the first act, Willie, a surly small-time gambler and hustler of Hungarian origin, receives a phone call from his Aunt Lotte in Cleveland informing him that his expected visit by his cousin Eva, who is coming from Hungary to live with Lotte, will have to be extended to ten days because Lotte is unexpectedly in the hospital. Willie makes it clear that he does not want Eva there. When Eva arrives, he orders her to speak English rather than Hungarian, as Willie strongly identifies as &quot;American.&quot; He grudgingly begins to enjoy her company. He becomes protective, discouraging her from going out alone, or beyond certain streets. At one point, Eva takes the initiative to clean the apartment, which is fairly dirty. When she finds his vacuum cleaner, Willie playfully tries to persuade her that an American expression for vacuuming is &quot;choking the alligator&quot;, but Eva doesn&#x27;t believe him.

Despite his growing fondness for Eva, Willie refuses to take her on his trips to the racetrack with Eddie, his good-natured friend and hustling accomplice. Eddie fruitlessly tries to persuade him to bring Eva along. Willie and Eva watch football in the afternoon and late-night sci-fi movies. His esteem for her increases when she returns from an excursion with a few canned food items, a TV dinner &quot;especially&quot; for him, and, to his astonishment, a carton of cigarettes, all obtained without money. He smiles and shakes her hand, telling her &quot;I think you&#x27;re alright, kid.&quot;

Eva, smart, pretty, and low-key, likes to play her favorite song, Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins&#x27;s &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, which Willie dislikes. He buys her a dress, which she dislikes. At this point it becomes evident that Willie has grown attached to Eva. When the ten days have passed, Eva leaves, and Willie is clearly upset to see her go. Eddie, on his way to visit Willie, sees her discard the dress on the street, but doesn&#x27;t tell Willie.

The second act starts a year later and opens with Willie and Eddie winning a large amount of money by cheating at poker. Willie asks Eddie about borrowing his brother-in-law&#x27;s car, telling him &quot;I just wanna get out&#x27;a here, see sump&#x27;in different, ya know?&quot;. He actually wants to go to Cleveland to see Eva.

It is the middle of winter. When they arrive in Cleveland, they stop at Lotte&#x27;s house, then go to surprise Eva at her job at a local fast-food restaurant, where she is excited and pleased to see them. However, they are soon just as bored as they were in New York. They pass the time by playing cards with Lotte and tagging along with Eva and her would-be boyfriend to the movies. They go to the pier on the frozen snow-covered lakefront to take in the view. Pressed by Eddie, Willie eventually decides to return to New York. When they say their goodbyes, Eva jokingly suggests that if they win big at the racetrack, they should &quot;kidnap&quot; her. Willie responds that they would take her someplace warm, because &quot;this place is awful.&quot;

The final act begins with Willie suggesting to Eddie, on the road back to New York, that they should go to Florida instead. He then suggests they turn around and pick up Eva—which they do, to Lotte&#x27;s obvious consternation. The three arrive in Florida and get a motel room. The next morning, the men leave Eva asleep in the room. Eva, awakening alone and with no food or cash, wanders outside in the windy bleak overcast afternoon to the beach, which appears not much more appealing than the windy bleak snowy Lake Erie scene in Cleveland from which they fled. When Willie and Eddie return, Eva&#x27;s annoyance turns to dismay when the distraught pair reveal they have lost most of their money on dog races. They go for a walk on the beach to figure out what to do. Willie is clearly annoyed with Eddie, as the dog races were his idea.

Willie and Eddie decide to go out and bet the last of their money on horse races. Willie still refuses to let Eva come along, so she goes out on the beach for a walk, wearing a flamboyant wide-brimmed straw hat she has just gotten from a gift shop. A drug dealer mistakes her for a courier he has been waiting for and gives her an envelope with a large sum of money, while berating her and her presumed boss. She returns to the motel, leaves some of the money for Willie and Eddie, and writes them a note explaining that she is going to the airport. Willie and Eddie, having won big at the horse races and gone through the better part of a bottle of whisky, return to the motel to find Eva gone. Willie reads her note and they go to the airport to stop her. Eva discusses with an airline ticket agent her options for flying to Europe, and the agent mentions that a plane leaves in 44 minutes for her home city of Budapest. Eva is indecisive.

When Willie and Eddie reach the airport, Willie, believing Eva has boarded the Budapest flight, buys a ticket, planning to board the plane and convince Eva to stay. In the next-to-last shot, Eddie stands outside, watching the plane fly overhead, lamenting that Willie was apparently not able to get off the plane, and that both Willie and Eva are headed to Budapest. In the final shot, we see Eva returning to the empty motel room, looking tired and perplexed, toying with the straw hat.

==Background and production==
Writer and director Jim Jarmusch shot his first feature, &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (1980) as his final thesis at New York University&#x27;s film school and spent the next four years making &quot;Stranger than Paradise&quot;. At NYU he studied under director Nicholas Ray, who had brought him along as his personal assistant for the production of &quot;Lightning over Water&quot;, a portrait of Ray being filmed by Wim Wenders. Wenders gave Jarmusch the remaining film stock from his subsequent film, &quot;Der Stand der Dinge&quot; (1982), enabling the young director to shoot the 30-minute short that became &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot;. It was released as a standalone film in 1982, and shown as &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; at the 1983 International Film Festival Rotterdam. When it was later expanded into a three-act feature, the name was appropriated for the feature itself, and the initial segment was renamed &quot;The New World&quot;.

==Release and reception==
The film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Caméra d&#x27;Or award for debut films (1984). It also won the Golden Leopard and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury – Special Mention at the 1984 Locarno International Film Festival, the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association, the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1985 and National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Picture of 1984. It went on to win the Kinema Junpo Award for best foreign-language film in 1987, and the award for National Film Registry at the National Film Preservation Board, USA in 2002.

The film earned $2,436,000, significantly more than its budget of around $100,000.

===Critics===
Film critic Pauline Kael gave the film a generally positive review:
===Home media===
&quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; has been released on DVD by The Criterion Collection as its 400th title. The DVD contains a second disc which includes Jarmusch&#x27;s first film, &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (1980). Both films were restored for the DVD release using high-definition digital transfers overseen and sanctioned by the director. Supplementary footage on the second disc includes &quot;Kino &#x27;84: Jim Jarmusch&quot;, a series of interviews with the cast and crew from both films by a German television program, as well as &quot;Some Days in January&quot; (1984), a behind-the-scenes Super-8 film by the director&#x27;s brother. An accompanying booklet features Jarmusch&#x27;s 1984 essay &quot;Some Notes on &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot;&quot; as well as critical commentary by Geoff Andrew and J. Hoberman on &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; and by Lucy Sante on &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; broke many conventions of traditional Hollywood filmmaking and became a landmark in modern independent film. According to allmovie, it is &quot;one of the most influential movies of the 1980s&quot;, and cast &quot;a wide shadow over the new generation of independent American filmmakers to come. It is cited for giving &quot;an early example of the low-budget independent wave that would dominate the cinematic marketplace a decade later&quot;. Its success accorded Jarmusch a certain iconic status within arthouse cinema as an idiosyncratic and uncompromising &quot;auteur&quot; exuding the aura of urban cool embodied by downtown Manhattan. In a 2005 profile of Jarmusch for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Lynn Hirschberg declared the film had &quot;permanently upended the idea of independent film as an intrinsically inaccessible avant-garde form&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It was included in Jonathan Rosenbaum&#x27;s Alternate 100, a response to the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies list. In 2003, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it #26 on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Cult Films&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it #14 on its list of 50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; as one of his favorite films.

==Soundtrack==
The film features an original soundtrack written by John Lurie, who also stars in the film. It is performed by The Paradise Quartet, consisting of Jill B. Jaffe (viola), Mary L. Rowell (violin), Kay Stern (violin), and Eugene Moye (cello). The recording engineer was Ollie Cotton. The original song &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; by Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins is featured in the soundtrack.

<doc id="165369" wikidata="Q2419392" url="?curid=165369" title="This Is Cinerama">
<text>This Is Cinerama is a 1952 American documentary film directed by Mike Todd, Michael Todd Jr., Walter A. Thompson and Fred Rickey and starring Lowell Thomas. It is designed to introduce the widescreen process Cinerama, which broadens the aspect ratio so that the viewer&#x27;s peripheral vision is involved. &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; premiered on September 30, 1952, at the Broadway Theatre in New York City.

==Plot==
The film begins in black and white and the standard Academy ratio (also presented in mono sound) as travel writer and newscaster Lowell Thomas appears to discuss the evolution of film entertainment, from the earliest cave paintings designed to suggest movement to the introduction of color and sound. At the conclusion of the 12-minute lecture, Thomas speaks the words &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; and the screen expands into the full Cinerama 2.65:1 aspect ratio and full color as a series of vignettes, narrated by Thomas, begins.

The film includes point-of-view scenes of the now defunct Atom Smasher roller coaster from the now defunct Rockaways&#x27; Playland, then moves on to a scene of the temple dance from the La Scala opera company&#x27;s production of &quot;Aïda.&quot; Also seen are views of Niagara Falls, a performance by a church choir (in sepia-toned black and white), a performance by the Vienna Boys&#x27; Choir, scenes of the canals of Venice, a military tattoo in Edinburgh, a bullfight in Spain, the &quot;triumphal scene&quot; from &quot;Aïda,&quot; a sound demonstration in stereo and scenes from the now defunct Cypress Gardens amusement park featuring an elaborate waterskiing show. The film closes with a sequence featuring soaring scenes of the natural landmarks of the American West, filmed from the nose of a low flying B-25, as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sings &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; &quot;Come, Come Ye Saints,&quot; and the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic.&quot;

The film&#x27;s producers were Lowell Thomas, Merian C. Cooper and Robert L. Bendick. The film was also directed by Bendick (and an uncredited Mike Todd Jr.). Cooper, who had directed the original 1933 &quot;King Kong,&quot; had a long history of technical innovation in cinema.

==Production==
Parts of the film were shot in the Kennecott open-pit mine and in Zion National Park in Utah. The movie was shot in Eastmancolor and released with Technicolor prints.

==Distribution==
Because the new technology required a special setup of three projectors and multiple soundtracks, the film&#x27;s distribution was also revolutionary. It was shown in a single theater in most cities, with reserved seats and lengthy runs—a distribution model known as a road show.

Audience members were asked to complete suggestion cards with their ideas for the next Cinerama demonstration film. In 1955, &quot;Cinerama Holiday&quot; was released.

For years the entire film could be shown only by one of the three remaining three-projector Cinerama installations capable of projecting 35mm prints. In September 2012, in celebration of the road show&#x27;s 60th anniversary, Flicker Alley released the film in its original format on Blu-ray disc. The image was adjusted with the SmileBox format, as was the Blu-ray release of &quot;How the West was Won,&quot; and the disc includes an audio commentary and other special features. On October 18, 2012, the Turner Classic Movies cable network aired &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; in its original aspect ratio for the first time (also in the Smilebox format).

In May 2018, Flicker Alley rereleased the film on Blu-ray disc with a remastered audio and video presentation again in the original Cinerama format. However, unlike the original 2012 Blu-ray release that was sourced from a 65mm duplicate negative because of financial constraints, the 2018 Deluxe Edition was a full restoration sourced from the original camera negative.

==Box office==
In its opening week in New York, &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; was shown twice per day, with an additional 5:00 p.m. showing on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. It saw near-capacity (1,250) attendance, grossing $35,000 from 17 performances with a top price of $2.80. The initial eight-week advance sale was increased to 16 weeks after the film proved to be popular. Early matinee attendance was impacted by the 1952 World Series between the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers. After one year, the film had played in four cities (New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Chicago) and had sold 2,225,000 tickets, grossing $4,305,000, with $2,208,000 in New York alone.

At the Warner Hollywood in Los Angeles, the film played for 115 weeks, grossing an L.A. record of $3,845,200. The film played for a record 99 weeks in Chicago.

By January 1954, the film had grossed $6.5 million from seven cities in the United States and Canada. A year later, &quot;Variety&quot; noted that the film was estimated to gross $25 million and included it on its all-time chart with rentals of $12.5 million. By 1995, &quot;Variety&quot; noted that the film had grossed $41.6 million.

==Awards==
At the 26th Academy Awards, &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; was nominated for the award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. Although the score was credited to Louis Forbes, who conducted the music, it was composed by Paul Sawtell, Roy Webb and Max Steiner (who composed the opening and ending sequences and those featuring Cypress Gardens and the flight across the country).

In 2002, the Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and inducted it into the National Film Registry for permanent preservation.

<doc id="165372" wikidata="Q4859885" url="?curid=165372" title="Barchester Towers">
<text>Barchester Towers is a novel by English author Anthony Trollope published by Longmans in 1857. It is the second book in the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot; series, preceded by &quot;The Warden&quot; and followed by &quot;Doctor Thorne&quot;. Among other things it satirises the antipathy in the Church of England between High Church and Evangelical adherents. Trollope began writing this book in 1855. He wrote constantly and made himself a writing-desk so he could continue writing while travelling by train. &quot;Pray know that when a man begins writing a book he never gives over&quot;, he wrote in a letter during this period. &quot;The evil with which he is beset is as inveterate as drinking – as exciting as gambling&quot;.

In his autobiography, Trollope observed &quot;In the writing of &quot;Barchester Towers&quot; I took great delight. The bishop and Mrs. Proudie were very real to me, as were also the troubles of the archdeacon and the loves of Mr. Slope&quot;. When he submitted his finished work, his publisher, William Longman, initially turned it down, finding much of it to be full of &quot;vulgarity and exaggeration&quot;. Recent critics offer a more positive opinion: &quot;Barchester Towers is many readers&#x27; favourite Trollope&quot;, wrote &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which included it in its 2009 list of &quot;1000 novels everyone must read&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Barchester Towers&quot; concerns the leading clergy of the fictional cathedral city of Barchester. The much loved bishop having died, all expectations are that his son, Archdeacon Grantly, will succeed him. Owing to the passage of the power of patronage to a new Prime Minister, a newcomer, the far more Evangelical Bishop Proudie, gains the see. His wife, Mrs Proudie, exercises an undue influence over the new bishop, making herself as well as the bishop unpopular with most of the clergy of the diocese. Her interference, leading the Bishop to veto the reappointment of the universally popular Mr Septimus Harding (protagonist of Trollope&#x27;s earlier novel, &quot;The Warden&quot;) as warden of Hiram&#x27;s Hospital, is not well received, even though she seeks to have the position given to a needy clergyman, Mr Quiverful, who has a wife and 14 children to support.

Even less popular than Mrs Proudie is the bishop&#x27;s new chaplain, the hypocritical and sycophantic Mr Obadiah Slope, who decides it would be expedient to marry Harding&#x27;s wealthy widowed daughter, Eleanor Bold. Slope hopes to win her favour by interfering in the controversy over the wardenship, in favour of Mr Harding. The Bishop, or rather Mr Slope under the direction of Mrs Proudie, also orders the return of the prebendary Dr Vesey Stanhope from Italy. Stanhope has been in Italy recovering from a sore throat for 12 years and has spent his time catching butterflies. With him to the Cathedral Close come his wife and their three adult children. The younger of Dr Stanhope&#x27;s two daughters causes consternation in the Palace and threatens the plans of Mr Slope. Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni is a disabled flirt with a young daughter and a mysterious Italian husband, whom she has left. Mrs Proudie is appalled and considers her an unsafe influence on her daughters, servants and Mr Slope. Mr Slope is drawn like a moth to a flame, and cannot keep away from the Signora. Dr Stanhope&#x27;s artistic son Bertie is skilled at spending money, but not at making it; his sisters think marriage to rich Eleanor Bold will help.

Summoned by Archdeacon Grantly to assist in the war against the Proudies and Mr Slope is the Reverend Francis Arabin. Mr Arabin is a considerable scholar, Fellow of Lazarus College at the University of Oxford, who nearly followed his mentor John Henry Newman into the Roman Catholic Church. A misunderstanding occurs between Eleanor and her father, brother-in-law, sister and Mr Arabin, who think that she intends to marry Mr Slope, much to their disgust. Mr Arabin is attracted to Eleanor, but the efforts of Grantly and his wife to stop her marrying Slope interfere with any relationship that might develop. At the Ullathorne garden party held by the Thornes, matters come to a head. Mr Slope proposes to Mrs Bold and is slapped for his presumption; Bertie goes through the motions of a proposal to Eleanor and is refused with good grace, and the Signora has a chat with Mr Arabin. Mr Slope&#x27;s double-dealings are now revealed and he is dismissed by both Mrs Proudie and the Signora. The Signora drops a delicate word in several ears and with the removal of the misunderstanding, Mr Arabin and Eleanor become engaged.

The Dean of the Cathedral having died, Mr Slope campaigns to become the new Dean but Mr Harding is offered the preferment, with a beautiful house in the Close and fifteen acres of garden. Mr Harding considers himself unsuitable and with the help of the archdeacon, arranges that Mr Arabin be made Dean. With the Stanhopes&#x27; return to Italy, life in the Cathedral Close returns to normal and Mr Harding continues his life of gentleness and music.

==Structure==

The literary scholar John Sutherland observes that Trollope suspended work on the novel (having reached the end of Chapter VIII) between February 1855 and May 1856, turning instead to his posthumously published &quot;The New Zealander.&quot; During this time he changed his idea of writing a short novel (similar in length to &quot;The Warden&quot;) to a longer one, and that from this hiatus there arise a number of inconsistencies in the text. In the first chapter Trollope says that Bishop Grantley is dying in &quot;the latter days of July&quot; and that Proudie became bishop &quot;just a month after his [Grantly&#x27;s] demise&quot;. At the beginning of Chapter IX, Sutherland observes that Trollope has Proudie three months onto his term as Bishop - effectively late November. However at the beginning of Chapter XII Slope is writing a letter dated 20 August, and in Chapters XXXIII and XXXV it is made clear that Miss Thorne&#x27;s &quot;fête champêtre&quot; takes place on the last day of September. In Chapter XLVIII Arabin proposes to Eleanor on &quot;a beautiful afternoon in the beginning of October&quot;.

Sutherland points out that in the early chapters Trollope describes the Proudies as intending to spend as much time as possible in London, leaving the field clear for Slope to act on his own in Barchester with the action easily contained in a single-volume novel: in Chapter IV, Slope thinks to himself that, in the Proudies&#x27; anticipated absences in London, &quot;he, therefore, he, Mr Slope, would in effect be bishop of Barchester&quot;. But when Trollope resumed the composition of &quot;Barchester Towers&quot; in May 1856, planning the eventual three-volume novel as a result of the unexpectedly increasing sales of &quot;The Warden&quot; in late 1855, he expanded the text by keeping the Proudies in Barchester and introducing a number of new characters who had not appeared in the earlier chapters - the Stanhopes, Mr Arabin, and the Thornes among others.

And although Sutherland notes that Trollope was &quot;often indifferent to minor inconsistencies in his narratives&quot;, he regards these lapses as showing the point at which Trollope conceived the idea of the novel series which would eventually become the hugely successful &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot;.

==Characters==

===High Church faction===
* Mr Septimus Harding is the meek, elderly precentor of Barchester and Rector of the church of St. Cuthbert&#x27;s near the Cathedral Close. He was formerly Warden of Hiram&#x27;s Hospital but resigned in &quot;The Warden&quot;.
* Archdeacon Grantly, Dr Theophilus Grantly, is the son of the former Bishop of Barchester, Dr Grantly senior, who dies at the start of the novel. Married to Susan Grantly, originally Susan Harding, he has three sons (Charles James, Henry, and Samuel) and two daughters (Florinda and Griselda) and lives at Plumstead Episcopi. His sister-in-law is Mrs Eleanor Bold, née Harding.
* Mrs Susan Grantly, Mr Harding&#x27;s elder daughter and the Archdeacon&#x27;s wife.
* Mr Francis Arabin, vicar of St Ewold, Old Wykehamist, Fellow of Lazarus College and former professor of poetry at the University of Oxford. He is a former follower of John Henry Newman and adheres to the High Church faction of the Anglican Church. Arabin is sought out by Dr Grantly as an ally against the evangelical faction of Bishop Proudie, his wife and chaplain Obadiah Slope.
* Dr Gwynne, Master of Lazarus College, another ally.

===Low Church faction===
* Bishop Proudie, apparently henpecked, weak-willed and under the influence of his wife Mrs Proudie and chaplain Obadiah Slope concerning the matters of the see.
* Mrs Proudie, a proud, vulgar, domineering wife, who promotes evangelical causes such as Sunday schools and is zealous in eliminating high-church rituals.
* Mr Obadiah Slope, a wheedling, oleaginous chaplain who has much influence over Bishop Proudie. Midway through the novel Slope decides that he will marry Mrs Eleanor Bold. Formerly Mrs Proudie&#x27;s ally, he comes into conflict with her over the wardenship of Hiram&#x27;s Hospital and she regards him as a traitor. The narrator speculates that he is a lineal descendant of Doctor Slop from the novel &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. He has been described as a significant sycophant: &quot;[epitomizing] the lick up/kick down sycophant — fawning with the powerful, tyrannical with subordinates&quot;.

===Others===

* Mrs Eleanor Bold, widow of Doctor John Bold, with an infant son; she is the younger daughter of Mr Septimus Harding. She has three potential suitors, Mr Obadiah Slope, Mr Bertie Stanhope and Mr Francis Arabin.
* Miss Mary Bold, sister of John Bold and therefore Mrs Bold&#x27;s sister-in-law.
* Dr Vesey Stanhope is the rector of Crabtree Canonicorum and of Stogpingum, in the diocese of Barchester, and a prebendary of Barchester Cathedral. He and his family lived for twelve years in Italy before being recalled by Bishop Proudie on Mr Slope&#x27;s advice. He has two daughters, Charlotte and Madeline, and a son, Ethelbert (Bertie).
* Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni née Madeline Stanhope is the beautiful younger daughter of Dr Vesey Stanhope, given to inflation of her own status- &quot;her father had been christened Vesey as another man is christened Thomas, and she had no more right to assume it than would have the daughter of a Mr Josiah Jones to call herself Mrs Josiah Smith, on marrying a man of the latter name&quot;; her card bears &quot;a bright gilt coronet&quot;, despite the fact that her husband, Paulo Neroni, &quot;had had not the faintest title to call himself a scion of even Italian nobility&quot;. Lamed by her abusive Italian husband, she is disabled and needs to be carried around the house on a sofa, although this does not stop her constantly flirting with men. She has a young daughter, Julia, whom she calls “the last of the Neros.”
* Ethelbert &quot;Bertie&quot; Stanhope is the only son of Dr Vesey Stanhope. An idling, carefree man who never settles down, he is a gifted artist, who borrows and spends a great deal and earns nothing. His sister Charlotte advises him to woo the rich and beautiful widow Eleanor Bold.
* Charlotte Stanhope is the polymath elder daughter of Dr Vesey Stanhope; she challenges Eleanor Bold to comment on the theological arguments concerning intelligent life on other worlds as presented by William Whewell and David Brewster. She is the manager of the family and a good friend of Eleanor Bold until Eleanor realises Charlotte is the primary instigator of her brother wooing her.
* Mr Quiverful, a poor clergyman with 14 children who becomes the new Warden of Hiram&#x27;s Hospital.
* Mrs Letty Quiverful, his wife.
* Wilfred Thorne, the squire of St Ewold&#x27;s. A bachelor of about fifty who comes under the charms of Signora Neroni.
* Miss Monica Thorne, Wilfred&#x27;s spinster sister of about sixty, who is an extreme traditionalist. She holds a garden party at their family residence, Ullathorne, for the notables of Barsetshire.

==Adaptations==

&quot;The Warden&quot; and &quot;Barchester Towers&quot; were filmed by the BBC as &quot;The Barchester Chronicles&quot; in 1982. This starred Donald Pleasence as Septimus Harding, Geraldine McEwan as Mrs Proudie, and launched the career of Alan Rickman as Obadiah Slope.

<doc id="165373" wikidata="Q2070468" url="?curid=165373" title="Why Man Creates">
<text>Why Man Creates is a 1968 animated short documentary film that discusses the nature of creativity. It was directed by Saul Bass, who co-wrote it with Mayo Simon. It won the Oscar for Best Documentary Short Subject. An abbreviated version of it ran on the first broadcast of CBS&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on September 24, 1968.

&quot;Why Man Creates&quot; focuses on the creative process and the different approaches taken to that process. It is divided into eight sections: The Edifice, Fooling Around, The Process, Judgment, A Parable, Digression, The Search, and The Mark.

In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

Saul Bass started thinking about creativity in the mid-1950s when he participated in a New York Art Directors Club &quot;Visual Communications Conference on Creativity (1958). In 1966 he was hired by the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Company to produce what was essentially a recruiting film for scientists and engineers from the East Coast, which then financed &quot;Why Man Creates&quot; with a budget of $200,000, which eventually exceeded $400,000.

==Summary==

The Edifice begins with early humans hunting. They attempt to conquer their prey with stones, but fail, so they begin to use spears and bait. They kill their prey and it turns into a cave painting, upon which a building begins to be built. Throughout the rest of the section, the camera tracks upward as the edifice grows ever taller.

Early cave dwellers begin to discover various things such as the lever, the wheel, ladders, agriculture, and fire. It then cuts to clips of early societies and civilizations. It depicts the appearance of the first religions and the advent of organized labor. It then cuts to the Great Pyramids at Giza and depicts the creation of writing.

Soon an army begins to move across the screen chanting, &quot;Bronze&quot;, but they are overrun by an army chanting, &quot;Iron&quot;. The screen then depicts early cities and civilizations.

This is followed by a black screen with one man in traditional Greek clothing who states, &quot;All was in chaos &#x27;til Euclid arose and made order.&quot; Next, various Greek achievements in mathematics are depicted as Greek columns are built, around which Greeks discuss items, including, &quot;What is the good life and how do you lead it?&quot; &quot;Who shall rule the state?&quot; &quot;The Philosopher King.&quot; &quot;The aristocrat.&quot; &quot;The people.&quot; &quot;You mean &quot;all&quot; the people?&quot; &quot;What is the nature of the Good? What is the nature of justice?&quot; &quot;What is happiness?&quot; A man in a bird costume then attempts to fly, a possible reference to Icarus.

The culture of ancient Greece fades into the armies of Rome. The organized armies surround the great Roman architecture as they chant, &quot;Hail Caesar!&quot; A man at a podium states, &quot;Roman law is now in session&quot;, and when he bangs his gavel, the architecture collapses. Dark soldiers begin to pop up from the rubble and eventually cover the whole screen with darkness symbolizing the Dark Ages.

The Dark Ages consist of inaudible whisperings and mumblings. At one point, a light clicks on and an Arab mathematician says, &quot;Allah be praised. I&#x27;ve invented the zero.&quot; at which point his colleague responds, &quot;What?&quot; and he says &quot;Nothing, nothing.&quot; Next come cloistered monks who sing in Gregorian Chant: &quot;What is the shape of the Earth? Flat. What happens when you get to the edge? You fall off. Does the earth move? Never.&quot;

Finally the scene brightens and shows a stained glass window. Various scientists open stained glass doors and say things such as, &quot;The Earth moves.&quot; &quot;The Earth is round.&quot; &quot;The blood circulates.&quot; &quot;There are worlds smaller than ours.&quot; &quot;There are worlds larger than ours.&quot; Each time one opens a door, a large, hairy arm slams the door shut. Finally, the stained glass breaks in the wake of the new enlightenment.

Next, Michelangelo and da Vinci are depicted. The steam engine is invented, and gears and belts begin to cover everything. The light bulb and steam locomotive are created. Darwin is referred to as two men hit each other with their canes arguing whether man is an animal. The telegraph is invented and psychology created. Next, a small creature hops across the screen saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a bug, I&#x27;m a germ, I&#x27;m a bug, I&#x27;m a germ... [indrawn breath] Louis Pasteur. I&#x27;m not a bug, I&#x27;m not a germ...&quot; The musicians Tchaikovsky and Beethoven are depicted. Alfred Nobel invents dynamite.

Next, the cartooning shows the great speeches and documents on government and society from the American Revolution onward with quotes such as, &quot;All men are created equal...&quot;, &quot;Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot;, &quot;And the government, by the people...&quot;, etc. and ends with &quot;One world.&quot;

Finally, the building stops and the Wright brothers&#x27; plane lands on top of it. It is quickly covered in more advanced planes, in cars, in televisions, and finally in early computers. At the top is a radioactive atom which envelops a man in smoke. The edifice ends with that man yelling, &quot;Help.&quot;

Fooling Around displays a random series of perspectives and the creative ideas which come from them.

The Process displays a man who is making artwork from a series of geometrical figures. Each time he attempts to keep them in place, they move and rearrange themselves, or collapses altogether on the man. He tries many different approaches to the problem. In between, there are three quotations from Thomas Edison, Ernest Hemingway, and Albert Einstein on what one has to do to solve problems. Finally he accepts a working configuration and calls his wife to look at it. She says, &quot;All it needs is an American flag.&quot;

Judgment is a series of reactions, presumably to the creation from The Process. It displays their criticisms of it, such as &quot;It represents the decline of Western culture...&quot;, and only a very few support it. A cowboy is the human target. A lady (voice veteran June Foray) voices a sound of approval.

A Parable begins at a ping-pong ball factory. Each ball is made in exactly the same way, and machines test them to get rid of anomalies. As the balls are being tested for their bounce levels, one bounces much higher than the rest. It is placed in a chute which leads to a garbage can outside the factory. It proceeds to bounce across town to a park, where it begins to bounce. Quickly, a cluster of ping-pong balls gather around it. It keeps bouncing higher and higher, until it doesn&#x27;t come back. It concludes with the comment:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;There are some who say he’s coming back and we have only to wait ...&lt;br&gt;
There are some who say he burst up there because balls were not meant to fly ...&lt;br&gt;
And there are some who maintain he landed safely in a place where balls bounce high ...&quot;

Digression is a very short section in which one snail says to another, &quot;Have you ever thought that radical ideas threaten institutions, then become institutions, and in turn reject radical ideas which threaten institutions?&quot; to which the other snail replies &quot;No.&quot; and the first says dejectedly, &quot;Gee, for a minute I thought I had something.&quot;

The Search shows scientists who have been working for years on projects such as solving world hunger (James F. Bonner), developing a cure for Cancer (Renato Dulbecco), or questioning the origin of the universe (Jesse Greenstein). Then it shows a scientist, who has worked on a project for seven years, which did not work out. He is asked what he will do next, and he replies that he does not know. (Note: each of the scientists shown was working on something which still has not been solved to date, even though each one expected solid results in only a few years. This forwards the concept shown in this session far better than the creators could have known in 1968.)

The Mark asks the question, Why does man create? and determines that man creates to simply state, &quot;I Am.&quot; The film ends by displaying &quot;I Am&quot; written in paint on the side of a building.

==Production==
Although uncredited, George Lucas, who was studying film at University of Southern California (USC) at the time, was the second unit cameraman on this film. Portions of this film also appear in the Saul Bass pitch video for the Bell System logo redesign.

==&quot;Why Man Creates&quot; today==

 the film was distributed by Pyramid Media. They offer English and Spanish versions, DVD and VHS versions, and also offer two differently-priced versions (one for an educational/institutional license, and one for a personal-use license). &quot;Why Man Creates&quot; was restored by the Academy Film Archive in 2011.

<doc id="165374" wikidata="Q180174" url="?curid=165374" title="Folly">
<text>In architecture, a folly is a building constructed primarily for decoration, but suggesting through its appearance some other purpose, or of such extravagant appearance that it transcends the range of usual garden buildings.

Eighteenth-century English landscape gardening and French landscape gardening often featured mock Roman temples, symbolising classical virtues. Other 18th-century garden follies imitated Chinese temples, Egyptian pyramids, ruined medieval castles or abbeys, or Tatar tents, to represent different continents or historical eras. Sometimes they represented rustic villages, mills and cottages, to symbolise rural virtues. Many follies, particularly during times of famine, such as the Great Famine in Ireland, were built as a form of poor relief, to provide employment for peasants and unemployed artisans.

In English, the term began as &quot;a popular name for any costly structure considered to have shown in the builder&quot;, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;&#x27;s definition. Follies are often named after the individual who commissioned or designed the project. The connotations of silliness or madness in this definition is in accord with the general meaning of the French word ; however, another older meaning of this word is &quot;delight&quot; or &quot;favourite abode&quot;. This sense included conventional, practical buildings that were thought unduly large or expensive, such as Beckford&#x27;s Folly, an extremely expensive early Gothic Revival country house that collapsed under the weight of its tower in 1825, 12 years after completion.

As a general term, &quot;folly&quot; is usually applied to a small building that appears to have no practical purpose or the purpose of which appears less important than its striking and unusual design, but the term is ultimately subjective, so a precise definition is not possible.

==Characteristics==

The concept of the folly is subjective and it has been suggested that the definition of a folly &quot;lies in the eyes of the beholder&quot;. Typical characteristics include:

* They have no purpose other than as an ornament. Often they have some of the appearance of a building constructed for a particular purpose, such as a castle or tower, but this appearance is a sham. Equally, if they have a purpose, it may be disguised.
* They are buildings, or parts of buildings. Thus they are distinguished from other garden ornaments such as sculpture.
* They are purpose-built. Follies are deliberately built as ornaments.
* They are often eccentric in design or construction. This is not strictly necessary; however, it is common for these structures to call attention to themselves through unusual details or form.
* There is often an element of fakery in their construction. The canonical example of this is the sham ruin: a folly which pretends to be the remains of an old building but which was in fact constructed in that state.
* They were built or commissioned for pleasure.

==History==

Follies began as decorative accents on the great estates of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, but they flourished especially in the two centuries which followed. Many estates had ruins of monastic houses and (in Italy) Roman villas; others, lacking such buildings, constructed their own sham versions of these romantic structures.

However, very few follies are completely without a practical purpose. Apart from their decorative aspect, many originally had a use which was lost later, such as hunting towers. Follies are misunderstood structures, according to The Folly Fellowship, a charity that exists to celebrate the history and splendour of these often neglected buildings.

===Follies in 18th-century French and English gardens===
Follies () were an important feature of the English garden and French landscape garden in the 18th century, such as Stowe and Stourhead in England and Ermenonville and the gardens of Versailles in France. They were usually in the form of Roman temples, ruined Gothic abbeys, or Egyptian pyramids. Painshill Park in Surrey contained almost a full set, with a large Gothic tower and various other Gothic buildings, a Roman temple, a hermit&#x27;s retreat with resident hermit, a Turkish tent, a shell-encrusted water grotto and other features. In France they sometimes took the form of romantic farmhouses, mills and cottages, as in Marie Antoinette&#x27;s Hameau de la Reine at Versailles. Sometimes they were copied from landscape paintings by painters such as Claude Lorrain and Hubert Robert. Often, they had symbolic importance, illustrating the virtues of ancient Rome, or the virtues of country life. The temple of philosophy at Ermenonville, left unfinished, symbolised that knowledge would never be complete, while the temple of modern virtues at Stowe was deliberately ruined, to show the decay of contemporary morals.

Later in the 18th century, the follies became more exotic, representing other parts of the world, including Chinese pagodas, Japanese bridges, and Tatar tents.

===Famine follies===
The Great Famine of Ireland of 1845–1849 led to the building of several follies in order to provide relief to the poor without issuing unconditional handouts. However, to hire the needy for work on useful projects would deprive existing workers of their jobs. Thus, construction projects termed &quot;famine follies&quot; came to be built. These included roads in the middle of nowhere, between two seemingly random points, screen and estate walls, piers in the middle of bogs, etc.

<text>RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was an ocean liner operated by Cunard Line. Along with the , she provided a weekly transatlantic service between Southampton in the United Kingdom and New York City in the United States, via Cherbourg in France.

Built by John Brown and Company at Clydebank, Scotland, as &quot;Hull 552&quot;, she was launched on 27 September 1938 and named in honour of Queen Elizabeth, the wife of King George VI. Her design was an improvement of that of &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, resulting in a vessel 12 feet longer and several thousand tons greater GRT, making her the largest passenger liner ever built for a record 56 years. She entered service in March 1940 as a troopship in the Second World War, and did not make her first commercial voyage as an ocean liner until October 1946.

With the decline in popularity of the transatlantic route, both ships were replaced by the smaller, more economical &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, which made her maiden voyage in 1969. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was retired from service on 9 December 1967, and sold to the city of Long Beach, California. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was retired after her final crossing to New York, on 8 December 1968. She was moved to Port Everglades, Florida, and converted to a tourist attraction, which opened in February 1969. The business was unsuccessful, and closed in August 1970. Finally, the ship was sold to Hong Kong businessman Tung Chao-yung, who intended to convert her into a floating university cruise ship called Seawise University. In 1972, while she was undergoing refurbishment in Hong Kong harbour, a fire broke out aboard under unexplained circumstances, and the vessel was capsized by the water used to fight the fire. The following year the wreck was deemed an obstruction to shipping in the area, and in 1974 and 1975 was partially scrapped on site.

==Design and construction==

On the day RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; sailed on her maiden voyage, Cunard&#x27;s chairman, Sir Percy Bates, informed his ship designers, headed by George Paterson, that it was time to start designing the planned second ship. The official contract between Cunard and government financiers was signed on 6 October 1936.

The new ship improved upon the design of &quot;Queen Mary&quot; with sufficient changes, including a reduction in the number of boilers to twelve instead of &quot;Queen Mary&quot; twenty-four, that the designers could discard one funnel and increase deck, cargo and passenger space. The two funnels were self-supporting and braced internally to give a cleaner-looking appearance. With the forward well deck omitted, a more refined hull shape was achieved, and a sharper, raked bow was added for a third bow-anchor point. She was to be twelve feet longer and 4,000 tons greater displacement than the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.
&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was built on slipway four at John Brown &amp; Company in Clydebank, Scotland, Great Britain. During her construction she was more commonly known by her shipyard number, Hull 552. The interiors were designed by a team of artists headed by the architect George Grey Wornum. The staircases, foyers and entrances were constructed by H.H. Martyn &amp; Co.. Cunard&#x27;s plan was for the ship to be launched in September 1938, with fitting-out intended to be complete for her to enter service in the spring of 1940. Queen Elizabeth herself performed the launching ceremony on 27 September 1938. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before the Queen could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the ship’s bow just before it slid out of reach. The liner was then docked for fitting out. It was announced that on 23 August 1939 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were to visit the ship and tour the engine room and that 24 April 1940 was to be the proposed date of her maiden voyage. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, these two events were postponed and Cunard&#x27;s plans were cancelled.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; sat at the fitting-out dock at the shipyard in her Cunard colours until 2 November 1939, when the Ministry of Shipping issued special licences to declare her seaworthy. On 29 December the engines were tested for the first time, running from 0900 to 1600 with the propellers disconnected to monitor her oil and steam operating temperatures and pressures. Two months later Cunard received a letter from Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, ordering the ship to leave Clydeside as soon as possible and &quot;to keep away from the British Isles as long as the order was in force&quot;.

==Second World War==
At the start of the Second World War, it was decided that &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was so vital to the war effort that she must not have her movements tracked by German spies operating in the Clydebank area. An elaborate ruse suggested to any German observers that she would sail to Southampton to complete her fitting-out. Another factor prompting the ship’s departure was the necessity to clear the fitting-out berth at the shipyard for the battleship , for final fitting-out, as only it could accommodate the &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships.

One major factor that limited the ship&#x27;s departure date was that there were only two spring tides that year high enough for &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; to leave the Clydebank shipyard, known also by German intelligence. A minimal crew of four hundred were assigned for the trip; most were transferred from and told that this would be a short coastal voyage to Southampton, but to pack for six months. Parts were shipped to Southampton, and preparations were made to move the ship into the King George V Graving Dock when she arrived. The names of Brown&#x27;s shipyard employees were booked to local hotels in Southampton, and Captain John Townley, who had previously commanded &quot;Aquitania&quot; on one voyage and several of Cunard&#x27;s smaller vessels, was appointed as her first master.

By the beginning of March 1940, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was ready to move; the ship had been fuelled, and adjustments to her compass were made, along with some final testing of equipment. The Cunard colours were painted over with battleship grey, and on the morning of 3 March, the ship quietly left her moorings in the Clyde and proceeded out of the river, where she was met by a King&#x27;s Messenger, who presented sealed orders directly to the captain.


They were to take the ship directly to New York, in the neutral United States, not to stop or even slow to drop off the Southampton harbour pilot who had embarked on at Clydebank, and to maintain strict radio silence. Later that day, when she was due to arrive at Southampton, the city was bombed by the Luftwaffe. 

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; zigzagged across the Atlantic to elude German U-boats and took six days to reach New York at an average speed of 26 knots. There she found herself moored alongside both &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and the French Line&#x27;s , the only time the world&#x27;s three largest ocean liners were ever berthed together.
Captain Townley received two telegrams on his arrival, one from his wife, and the other from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth thanking him for the vessel&#x27;s safe delivery. The ship was then secured so that no one could board her without prior permission, including port officials.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; left the port of New York on 13 November 1940, for Singapore to receive her troopship conversion. After two stops to refuel and replenish her stores in Trinidad and Cape Town, she arrived in Singapore&#x27;s naval docks, where she was fitted with anti-aircraft guns, and her hull repainted grey.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; left Singapore on 11 February, and on 23 February 1942, secretly arrived in Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada. She underwent refit work in drydock adding accommodation and armaments, and three hundred naval ratings quickly painted the hull. In mid-March, carrying 8,000 American soldiers, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; began a 7,700-mile voyage from San Francisco to Sydney, Australia. She then carried Australian troops to theatres of operation in Asia and Africa. After 1942, the two &quot;Queens&quot; were relocated to the North Atlantic for the transportation of American troops to Europe. Their high speeds allowed them to outrun hazards, principally German U-boats, usually allowing them to travel outside a convoy and without escort. Nevertheless, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was the target of U-704, which fired four torpedoes at her on 9 November 1942. The commander, Horst Wilhelm Kessler, heard a detonation and Nazi radio propaganda claimed she was sunk. In reality, one of the torpedoes detonated prematurely and the ship was unharmed.

During her war service &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; carried more than 750,000 troops, and sailed some .

==As a liner==

Following the end of the Second World War, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was refitted and furnished as an ocean liner, while her running mate &quot;Queen Mary&quot; remained in her wartime role and grey appearance except for her funnels, which were repainted in the company&#x27;s colours. For another year, her sibling did military service, returning troops and G.I. brides to the United States while &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was overhauled at the Firth of Clyde Drydock, in Greenock, by the John Brown Shipyard.

Six years of war service had never permitted the formal sea trials to take place, so they were now finally undertaken. Under the command of Commodore Sir James Bisset, the ship travelled to the Isle of Arran to carry them out. On board was the ship&#x27;s namesake, Queen Elizabeth, and her two daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. During the trials, Queen Elizabeth took the wheel for a brief time, and the two young princesses recorded the two measured runs with stopwatches that they had been given for the occasion. Bisset was under strict instructions from Sir Percy Bates, who was also aboard the trials, that all that was required from the ship was two measured runs of no more than 30 knots and that she was not permitted to attempt to attain a higher speed record than &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;″s engines were capable of driving her to speeds of over 32 knots. After her trials &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; finally entered passenger service, allowing Cunard White Star to launch the long-planned two-ship weekly service to New York. Despite specifications similar to those of &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; never held the Blue Riband, for Cunard White Star chairman Sir Percy Bates asked that the two ships not to compete against each other.

The ship ran aground on a sandbank off Southampton on 14 April 1947, and was re-floated the following day.

In 1955, during an annual overhaul at Southampton, England, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was fitted with underwater fin stabilisers to smooth the ride in rough seas. Two retractable fins were fitted on each side of the hull, allowing fuel savings in smooth seas and during docking. On 29 July 1959, she was in a collision with the American freighter &quot;American Hunter&quot; in foggy conditions in New York Harbor and was holed above the waterline.


Together with &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and in competition with the American liners and , &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; dominated the transatlantic passenger trade until their fortunes began to decline with the advent of the faster and more economical jet airliner in the late 1950s. As passenger numbers declined, the liners became uneconomic to operate in the face of rising fuel and labour costs. For a short time the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, then under the command of Commodore Geoffrey Trippleton Marr, attempted a dual role of alternating her usual transatlantic route with cruising between New York and Nassau. For this new tropical excursion the ship received a major refit in 1965, with a new Lido deck added to her aft section, enhanced air conditioning, and an outdoor swimming pool. With these improvements, Cunard intended to keep the ship in operation until at least the mid-1970s. However, the strategy did not prove successful, owing to the ship&#x27;s deep draught, which prevented her from entering various island ports, and high fuel costs. She was also too wide for transiting the Panama Canal, limiting travel to the Pacific.

Cunard retired &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in 1967 and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; upon her final Atlantic crossing to New York on 5 November 1968. The two liners were replaced with the new, smaller, more economical &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;.

==Final years==

In late 1968, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was sold to the Elizabeth Corporation, with 15% of the company controlled by a group of Philadelphia businessmen and 85% retained by Cunard. The new company intended to operate the ship as a hotel and tourist attraction in Port Everglades, Florida, similar to the planned use of &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in Long Beach, California. &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, as she was now called, arrived in Port Everglades on 8 December 1968 and opened to tourists in February 1969, well before &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, which opened two years later, in 1971. The vessel was sold to Queen Ltd of Port Everglades on 19 July 1969. However, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s&quot; retirement in Florida was not to last. The climate of southern Florida was much harder on the ship than the climate of southern California was on &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. There was some talk of permanently flooding the bilge and allowing &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; to rest on the bed of the Intracoastal Waterway in Ft. Lauderdale harbour (Port Everglades) and remain open, but the ship was forced to close in August 1970, after losing money and being declared a fire hazard. The vessel was sold at auction in 1970 to Hong Kong tycoon Tung Chao Yung.

Tung, the head of the Orient Overseas Line, intended to convert the vessel into a university for the World Campus Afloat program (later reformed and renamed as Semester at Sea). Following the tradition of the Orient Overseas Line, the ship was renamed &quot;Seawise University&quot;.

The ship was under Hong Kong ownership, and sailed for Hong Kong on 10 February 1971. This was ill-advised, as the ship&#x27;s engines and boilers were in poor condition after several years of neglect. The retired Commodore Marr and a former chief engineer of the ship were hired by Tung as advisors for the journey to Hong Kong. Marr recommended that &quot;Seawise University&quot; be towed to the New Territories, but Tung and his crew were convinced that they could get there using just the aft engines and boilers. The planned several-week trip turned into months as the crew battled with boiler issues and a fire. An unplanned lengthy mid-voyage stopover allowed the new owners to fly spare parts out to the ship and carry out repairs before resuming course, arriving in Hong Kong Harbour in July 1971.

With the £5 million conversion nearing completion, the vessel caught fire on 9 January 1972. These fires were set deliberately, as several blazes broke out simultaneously throughout the ship and a later court of inquiry handed down a cause of arson by person or persons unknown. The fact that Tung had acquired the vessel for $3.5 million, and had insured it for $8 million, led some to speculate that the inferno was part of a fraud to collect on the insurance claim. Others speculated that the fires were the result of a conflict between Tung, a Chinese Nationalist, and Communist-dominated ship construction unions.

The ship rolled on its side from the water sprayed on her by fireboats, then settled on the bottom of Victoria Harbour. The vessel was finally declared a shipping hazard and dismantled for scrap between December 1974 and 1975. Portions of the hull that were not salvaged, as well as the keel, boilers and engines, remained at the bottom of the harbour, and the area was marked as &quot;Foul&quot; on local sea charts, warning ships not to try to anchor there. It is estimated that around 40–50% of the wreck was still on the seabed. In the late 1990s, the last remains of the wreck were buried during land reclamation for the construction of Container Terminal 9. The position of the wreck is .


After the fire, Tung had one of the liner&#x27;s anchors and the metal letters &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;E&quot; from the name on the bow placed in front of the office building at Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, California, which had been intended as the headquarters of the Seawise University venture; they later went on display with commemorative plaques in the lobby of Wall Street Plaza, 88 Pine Street, New York City. Two of the ship&#x27;s fire warning system brass plaques were recovered by a dredger, and were displayed at The Aberdeen Boat Club in Hong Kong in an exhibit about the ship. The charred remnants of her last ensign were cut from the flagpole and framed in 1972, and still adorn the wall of the officers&#x27; mess of marine police HQ in Hong Kong. Parker Pen Company produced a special edition of 5,000 pens made from material recovered from the wreck, each in a presentation box; today these are highly collectible.

Following the demise of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, the largest passenger ship in active service became the 66,343 GRT , which was longer but with less tonnage than the Cunard liner. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; held the record of largest passenger ship ever built until the 101,353 GT Carnival Destiny (later Carnival Sunshine) was launched in 1996. To date, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; still holds the record as the largest passenger ship for the longest period of time: 56 years.

==In fiction==
In 1959, the ship made an appearance in the British satirical comedy film &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot;, starring Peter Sellers and Jean Seberg. While a troupe of invading men from &quot;Grand Fenwick&quot;, a fictional European micro-nation, cross the Atlantic to &#x27;war&#x27; with the United States, they meet and pass the far larger &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, and learn that the port of New York is closed due to an air raid drill.

Ian Fleming set the climax to his 1956 James Bond novel &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; on &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. The 1971 film version starring Connery used the P&amp;O liner for the sequence.

The wreck was featured in the 1974 James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, as a covert headquarters for MI6.

<text>Wild and Woolly is a 1917 American silent Western comedy film which tells the story of one man&#x27;s personal odyssey from cowboy-obsessed Easterner to Western tough guy. It stars Douglas Fairbanks, Eileen Percy, Walter Bytell and Sam De Grasse. The film was adapted by Anita Loos from a story by Horace B. Carpenter and was directed by John Emerson.

==Plot==

As described in a film magazine review, Jeff Hillington, son of railroad magnate Collis J. Hillington, tires of the East and longs for the wild and woolly West. He has his apartment and office fixed up in his understanding of the accepted Western style, which he has gleaned from dime novels. A delegation from Bitter Creek comes to New York City seeking financial backing for the construction of a spur line, and go to Collis to explain their proposition. Collis sends Jeff to investigate. The citizens of Bitter Creek, Arizona, realizing that a favorable report from Jeff is necessary, decide to live up to Jeff&#x27;s idea of a Western town. They set up a program with a wild reception for Jeff, a barroom dance, and a train holdup. Steve Shelby, a grafting Indian agent, knowing that he is about to be caught by the government, decides to do &quot;one more trick&quot; and enters into the plan to rob the train, turning it into a real scheme. Events turn earnest and Shelby kidnaps Nell Larabee, with whom Jeff has fallen in love. The entire crowd has been trapped in the dance hall, which is surrounded by Indians, and Jeff&#x27;s revolver loaded with blanks. When the situation is finally explained to Jeff, by superhuman efforts (and typical Fairbanks surprises) he rounds up the Indians, rescues the girl, completely foils the scheme of Steve, and becomes the hero of the hour, getting to marry Nell.

==Production==

&quot;Wild and Woolly&quot; was filmed in Manhattan and the Paragon Studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where many early film studios in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were based at the beginning of the 20th century. The scenes of the Arizona town were shot over a week&#x27;s time in Burbank, California. Joseph Henabery served as an assistant to director John Emerson.

==Reception==
Like many American films of the time, &quot;Wild and Woolly&quot; was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required cuts of the intertitle &quot;Say, that&#x27;s a chance for us to clean up big,&quot; all scenes of the Indian Agent and Indians with a basket containing flasks of liquor, the three intertitles &quot;Whoop it up and all you capture is yours,&quot; You watch every door of the hotel and after I get the girl you kill,&quot; and &quot;They can&#x27;t hurt you, their guns are loaded with fake bullets,&quot; scene where Fairbanks is shot, an Indian shoots a man, four scenes of Indians falling after being shot, and the shooting of the express messenger, taking his keys, and the rifling of the express box.

Edward Wietzel offered the following in his contemporaneous review for The Moving Picture World: &quot;A cow in a clover field, a cat with a catnip ball or a monkey with a bushel of peanuts never had a more enjoyable time than the gloom-dispersing Mr. Douglas Fairbanks extracts from each of the situations in the photoplay. Most of these situations are not new, but the method of their working out is frequently novel and often exceedingly funny.&quot;

Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance, writing in 2008, believes &quot;Wild and Woolly&quot; &quot;is the finest of the surviving Fairbanks-Emerson-Loos collaborations and perhaps the best of the thirteen films he made for Artcraft. It was also one of Fairbanks&#x27;s personal favorites.&quot;

==Preservation status==
Copies of &quot;Wild and Woolly&quot; are preserved in several film collections and archives, and it has been released on DVD. In 2002, this film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

<text>Wild River is a 1960 American drama film directed by Elia Kazan, and starring Montgomery Clift, Lee Remick and Jo Van Fleet. It was filmed in the Tennessee Valley, and was adapted by Paul Osborn from two novels: Borden Deal&#x27;s &quot;Dunbar&#x27;s Cove&quot; and William Bradford Huie&#x27;s &quot;Mud on the Stars&quot;, drawing for plot from Deal&#x27;s story of a battle of wills between the nascent Tennessee Valley Authority and generations-old land owners, and from Huie&#x27;s study of a rural Southern matriarchal family for characters and their reaction to destruction of their land, and the controversial employment of African-American laborers by the TVA. It marked Bruce Dern&#x27;s film debut. The film was selected for National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2002.

==Plot==
In 1937, Chuck Glover (Montgomery Clift), the new head of the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s (TVA) land purchasing office, arrives in Garthville, Tennessee, a town located upstream from a new hydroelectric dam.

Glover is supervising the clearing of the land to be flooded. His first need is to acquire Garth Island on the Tennessee River. Elderly Ella Garth (Jo Van Fleet), matriarch of a large family that has lived on the island for decades, refuses to sell. To avoid bad publicity, the TVA wants to acquire the island without force.

Clearing the land is behind schedule because the mayor uses only white labor. Chuck goes to Garth Island, but Ella and the other Garth women, including Ella&#x27;s granddaughter Carol Baldwin (Lee Remick), ignore him. Glover tries reasoning with Ella&#x27;s three adult sons, Hamilton (Jay C. Flippen), Cal (James Westerfield), and Joe John (Big Joe Bess in an uncredited role), but relocating means their having to work for a living.

Chuck is forced to leave, but Hamilton later invites him back to speak with Ella. Chuck finds Ella criticizing President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal to her black farm hands and their families. Chuck stresses the benefits the dam will bring, but Ella denounces dams and the taming of rivers as going &quot;against nature.&quot; Ella then shows Chuck the family cemetery on the island&#x27;s highest point.

Chuck learns that Carol is a widow with two small children. She returned to the island after her husband died. She is expected to marry Walter Clark (Frank Overton), a businessman in town. Chuck advises her against marrying if she does not love him. He then addresses the farmhands about working for the TVA, reasoning their leaving the island will force Ella to sell. Carol invites Chuck to her former home off the island. They spend the night together and are soon falling in love.

The mayor opposes Chuck&#x27;s hiring &quot;colored labor&quot;, saying it will cause problems with white workers. Chuck is urged to create segregated work gangs and pay black workers less. Chuck refuses despite receiving veiled threats.

Carol and Chuck spend another night together, unaware that Walter Clark has seen them. The next morning Ella&#x27;s workers and their families leave the island. Ella remains alone except for her field hand, Sam, who loyally refuses to go. Ella knows about Carol and Chuck. When Carol begs her grandmother to stay at her house, she orders her off the island.

R. J. Bailey (Albert Salmi), a cotton farmer whose black sharecroppers are quitting to work for the TVA, agrees to help scare Chuck from seeing Carol. Walter lures Chuck to his hotel room where Bailey is waiting. After Chuck treats him decently regarding their rivalry for Carol, Walter warns Chuck about Bailey.

Bailey, awaiting with his shotgun in Chuck&#x27;s hotel room, tells Chuck a story. It seems that one of Bailey&#x27;s workers left his employ as a sharecropper to work for the TVA for $5 per day, as opposed to the $2 per day he made working for Bailey. Infuriated, Bailey found a stick of wood about two inches thick, kidnapped the worker, brought him back to his farm, and beat him senseless. The employee, now realizing he is enslaved to Bailey, cannot return to the fields for two days, as he recovers from the beating.

For the aforementioned trouble Chuck caused him, Bailey states that Chuck owes him $4, for the $2 per day in value of lost labor due to the recovery time of the employee. When Chuck refuses, Bailey beats him and takes the money.

Soon after, Chuck and Walter go to the island to see Ella. Chuck admits misunderstanding her fight to protect her dignity. The following day, Chuck learns that the dam&#x27;s flood gates will be closed in a few days and Ella must be evicted immediately.

Chuck rejects Hamilton and Cal&#x27;s idea to have Ella declared legally incompetent so they can sell the land. He reluctantly asks the U.S. marshal to remove Ella the next day, then goes to the island in a final attempt to persuade her to voluntarily leave. She refuses.

Carol wants to go with Chuck when he moves on to his next assignment, though he remains unsure. Walter arrives to warn them that Bailey and his men are coming to terrorize them.

While the local sheriff stands aside, believing the good ol&#x27; boys are harmless, the thugs shoot out a window, overturn Chuck&#x27;s car, and drive Walter&#x27;s truck into the side of the house. Refusing to be driven off, Chuck confronts Bailey, but is knocked unconscious. Only then, the sheriff runs off the thugs.

Chuck and Carol marry. The next day, with Chuck and Carol present, Ella is evicted from the island as her former workers fell the trees. At her new home, Ella sits on the porch, refusing to speak.

Soon after, Carol tells Chuck that Ella just died. Before leaving the valley, Chuck and Carol join her family and former workers to bury Ella in the family plot, the only part of Garth Island above water in the new lake.

==Production==
A script was written by Ben Maddow but he refused credit because none of it was used in the final film.

Coon Denton Island on the Hiwassee River, in northern Bradley County, Tennessee, upriver from Charleston, served as the fictional Garth Island, and the city of Charleston&#x27;s old business district served as the fictional city of Garthville. A peninsula northwest of Cleveland, Tennessee, on Chickamauga Lake, was used, and a studio for interior shooting was created in the Cleveland armory. A few other locations in rural Bradley County near Charleston were also used. Principal photography began on October 19, 1959. On January 3, 1960, Kazan left for his New York home, and filming was completed over the following week.

==Preservation==
The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive.

The university was founded as the Medical College of Louisiana in 1834 partly as a response to the fears of smallpox, yellow fever, and cholera in the United States. The university became the second medical school in the South, and the 15th in the United States at the time. In 1847, the state legislature established the school as the University of Louisiana, a public university, and the law department was added to the university. Subsequently, in 1851, the university established its first academic department. The first president chosen for the new university was Francis Lister Hawks, an Episcopal priest and prominent citizen of New Orleans at the time.

The university was closed from 1861 to 1865 during the American Civil War. After reopening, it went through a period of financial challenges because of an extended agricultural depression in the South which affected the nation&#x27;s economy. Paul Tulane, owner of a prospering dry goods and clothing business, donated extensive real estate within New Orleans for the support of education. This donation led to the establishment of a Tulane Educational Fund (TEF), whose board of administrators sought to support the University of Louisiana instead of establishing a new university. In response, through the influence of former Confederate general Randall Lee Gibson, the Louisiana state legislature transferred control of the University of Louisiana to the administrators of the TEF in 1884. This act created the Tulane University of Louisiana. The university was privatized, and is one of only a few American universities to be converted from a state public institution to a private one.

Paul Tulane&#x27;s endowment to the school specified that the institution could only admit white students, and Louisiana law passed in 1884 reiterated this condition.

In 1884, William Preston Johnston became the first president of Tulane. He had succeeded Robert E. Lee as president of Washington and Lee University after Lee&#x27;s death. He had moved to Louisiana and become president of Louisiana State University in 1880.

In 1885, the university established its graduate division, later becoming the Graduate School. One year later, gifts from Josephine Louise Newcomb totaling over $3.6 million, led to the establishment of the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College within Tulane University. Newcomb was the first coordinate college for women in the United States and became a model for such institutions as Pembroke College and Barnard College. In 1894 the College of Technology formed, which would later become the School of Engineering. In the same year, the university moved to its present-day uptown campus on historic St. Charles Avenue, five miles (8 km) by streetcar from downtown New Orleans.

===20th century===

With the improvements to Tulane University in the late 19th century, Tulane had a firm foundation to build upon as the premier university of the Deep South and continued the legacy with growth in the 20th century. During 1907, the school established a four-year professional curriculum in architecture through the College of Technology, growing eventually into the Tulane School of Architecture. One year later, Schools of Dentistry and Pharmacy were established, albeit temporarily. The School of Dentistry ended in 1928, and Pharmacy six years later. In 1914, Tulane established a College of Commerce, the first business school in the South. In 1925, Tulane established the independent Graduate School. Two years later, the university set up a School of Social Work, also the first in the southern United States. Tulane was instrumental in promoting the arts in New Orleans and the South in establishing the Newcomb School of Art with William Woodward as director, thus establishing the renowned Newcomb Pottery. The Middle American Research Institute was established in 1925 at Tulane &quot;for the purpose of advanced research into the history (both Indian and colonial), archaeology, tropical botany (both economic and medical), the natural resources and products, of the countries facing New Orleans across the waters to the south; to gather, index and disseminate data thereupon; and to aid in the upbuilding of the best commercial and friendly relations between these Trans-Caribbean peoples and the United States.&quot;

University College was established in 1942 as Tulane&#x27;s division of continuing education. By 1950, the School of Architecture had grown out of Engineering into an independent school. In 1958, the university was elected to the Association of American Universities, an organization consisting of 62 of the leading research universities in North America. The School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine again became independent from the School of Medicine in 1967. It was established in 1912. Tulane&#x27;s School of Tropical Medicine also remains the only one of its kind in the country. On April 23, 1975, US President Gerald Ford spoke at Tulane University&#x27;s Fogelman Arena at the invitation of F. Edward Hebert, the US representative of Louisiana&#x27;s 1st Congressional District. During the historic speech, Ford announced that the Vietnam War was &quot;finished as far as America is concerned&quot; one week before the fall of Saigon. Ford drew parallels to the Battle of New Orleans and said that such positive activity could do for America&#x27;s morale what the battle did in 1815.

During World War II, Tulane was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

In 1963, Tulane enrolled its first African American students. In 1990, Rhonda Goode-Douglas, alongside other black, female students, founded the first African American sorority in Tulane&#x27;s history, AKA Omicron Psi.

A detailed account of the history of Tulane University from its founding through 1965 was published by Dyer.

===21st century===
In July 2004, Tulane received two $30 million donations to its endowment, the largest individual or combined gifts in the university&#x27;s history. The donations came from James H. Clark, a member of the university&#x27;s board of trustees and founder of Netscape, and David Filo, a graduate of its School of Engineering and co-founder of Yahoo!. A fund-raising campaign called &quot;Promise &amp; Distinction&quot; raised $730.6 million by October 3, 2008, increasing the university&#x27;s total endowment to more than $1.1 billion; by March 2009, Yvette Jones, Tulane&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer, told Tulane&#x27;s Staff Advisory Council that the endowment &quot;has lost close to 37%&quot;, affected by the Great Recession. In 2021, Tulane had to evacuate all students and close down for a month due to damage from Hurricane Ida. No classes took place for two weeks, then there were virtual classes for the remaining two weeks.

In June 2024, non-tenure track faculty at Tulane voted to form Tulane Workers United, the first higher education faculty union in the state of Louisiana. The union is formally affiliated with Workers United and SEIU.

====Hurricane Katrina====
As a result of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and its damaging effects on New Orleans, most of the university was closed for the second time in its history—the first being during the Civil War. The closing affected the first semester of the school calendar year. The School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine&#x27;s distance learning programs and courses stayed active. The School of Medicine relocated to Houston, Texas for a year. Aside from student-athletes attending college classes together on the same campuses, most undergraduate and graduate students dispersed to campuses throughout the U.S. The storm inflicted more than $650 million in damages to the university, with some of the greatest losses impacting the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library and its collections.

Facing a budget shortfall, the Board of Administrators announced a &quot;Renewal Plan&quot; in December 2005 to reduce its annual operating budget and create a &quot;student-centric&quot; campus. Addressing the school&#x27;s commitment to New Orleans, a course credit involving service learning became a requirement for an undergraduate degree. In 2006 Tulane became the first Carnegie ranked &quot;high research activity&quot; institution to have an undergraduate public service graduation requirement. In May 2006, graduation ceremonies included commencement speakers former Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who commended the students for their desire to return to Tulane and serve New Orleans in its renewal.

==Campus==
===Uptown===

Tulane&#x27;s primary campus is located in Uptown New Orleans on St. Charles Avenue, directly opposite Audubon Park, and extends north to South Claiborne Avenue through Freret and Willow Street. The campus is known colloquially as the Uptown or St. Charles campus. It was established in the 1890s and occupies more than of land. The campus is known both for its large live oak trees as well as its architecturally historic buildings. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978. The campus architecture consists of several styles, including Richardsonian Romanesque, Elizabethan, Italian Renaissance, Mid-Century Modern, and contemporary styles. The front campus buildings use Indiana White Limestone or orange brick for exteriors, while the middle campus buildings are mostly adorned in red St. Joe brick, the staple of Newcomb College Campus buildings. Loyola University is directly adjacent to Tulane, on the downriver side. Audubon Place, where the President of Tulane resides, is on the upriver side. The President&#x27;s residence is the former home of &quot;banana king&quot; Sam Zemurray, who donated it in his will.

The centerpiece of the Gibson Quad is the first academic building built on campus, Gibson Hall, in 1894. The School of Architecture is also located on the oldest section of the campus, occupying the Richardson Memorial Building. The middle of the campus, between Feret and Willow Streets, and bisected by McAlister Place and Newcomb Place, serves as the center of campus activities. The Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life, Devlin Fieldhouse, McAlister Auditorium, Howard-Tilton Memorial Library, and most of the student residence halls and academic buildings populate the center of campus.

The Howard-Tilton Memorial Library is located on Freret Street. It was under construction from 2013 to 2016, but it now has two additional floors, as well as a Rare Books room. The facilities for the Freeman School of Business line McAlister Place and sit next to the Tulane University Law School. The center of campus is also home to the historic Newcomb College Campus, which sits between Newcomb Place and Broadway. The Newcomb campus was designed by New York architect James Gamble Rogers, noted for his work with Yale University&#x27;s campus. The Newcomb campus is home to Tulane&#x27;s performing and fine arts venues.

The back of campus, between Willow Street and South Claiborne, is home to two residence halls (Aron Residences and Décou-Labat Residences), Reily Recreation Center, and Turchin Stadium, and in January 2013, ground was broken on Tulane&#x27;s Yulman Stadium between Reily Recreation Center and Turchin Stadium. Tulane Green Wave football had played in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome since Tulane Stadium&#x27;s demolition in 1980. They now play in Yulman Stadium, which opened in September 2014.

After Hurricane Katrina, Tulane has continued to build new facilities and renovate old spaces on its campus. The newest dorm buildings, Lake and River Residence Halls, were completed in 2023 following the demolition of Phelps Hall and Irby Hall. Weatherhead Hall was completed in 2011, and it now houses sophomore students. Construction on Greenbaum House, a Residential College in the Newcomb Campus area, began in January 2013 and was completed by Summer 2014. The Lallage Feazel Wall Residential College was completed in August 2005 and took in its first students when Tulane re-opened in January 2006. Usually an honors dorm, Wall began accommodating students of all academic standings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life (LBC) was renovated to be a green, environmentally friendly building and opened for student use in January 2007. In 2009, the university altered McAlister Drive, a street that ran through the middle of the uptown campus into a pedestrian walkway renamed McAlister Place. The area was resurfaced, and the newly added green spaces were adorned with Japanese magnolias, irises and new lighting. In late November 2008 the City of New Orleans announced plans to add bicycle lanes to the St. Charles Avenue corridor that runs in front of campus.

In 2019, a new student space located in the middle of the uptown campus, The Malkin Sacks Commons, was opened by President Mike Fitts. The Commons is the central dining area on campus. Catering to most dietary restrictions, The Commons directly connects to the Lavin-Bernick Center on the second floor, and on its third floor houses the Newcomb Institute.

===Graduate housing===
There is one graduate housing complex for Tulane University, Bertie M. and John W. Deming Pavilion, in the Downtown Campus. it is not operated by the university&#x27;s Department of Housing and Residence Life.

There were previously two other complexes:
* Global Collective, a graduate student housing complex on the Uptown campus of Tulane university operated by the university&#x27;s Department of Housing and Residence Life
* Papillon Apartments, an apartment complex in the Lower Garden District operated by the university&#x27;s Department of Housing and Residence Life for graduate students and their families. It was managed by HRI Properties. The university acquired the building circa 2005, which previously served as an apartment for people unaffiliated with the university. The university initially paid the taxes for the apartments of legacy non-Tulane residents but began charging the taxes to these tenants in 2013. In June 2016 the university announced it would not renew the leases of the non-Tulane tenants.

===Other campuses===

The Tulane University Health Sciences campus is located in the downtown New Orleans Central Business District between the Mercedes-Benz Superdome and Canal Street in 18 mid/high-rise buildings, which house the School of Medicine, the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and the main campus of the Tulane Medical Center. In addition to medical and public health education, the Health Sciences campus is the central location for biomedical research. Students and faculty from the Health Sciences campus are also involved in community-wide health promotion, such as community health fairs and distributing condoms to address the high rate of STIs in New Orleans. In 2014, the Tulane University School of Social Work relocated from the Uptown campus to the Health Sciences campus, with facilities located in a renovated historic building on Elk Place.

Tulane University Square consists of of space and of surrounding land located on Broadway and Leake Avenue adjacent to the Mississippi River.

Outside of New Orleans, the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Covington, Louisiana is one of eight such centers funded by the National Institutes of Health. The F. Edward Hebert Research Center near Belle Chasse, Louisiana provides facilities for graduate training and research in computer science, bioengineering, and biology. Satellite campuses of the School of Continuing Studies, Tulane&#x27;s open admissions school of continuing studies, are located in downtown New Orleans, in Elmwood, Louisiana, and in Biloxi, Mississippi. From 2010 to 2017, Tulane also operated a satellite campus in Madison, Mississippi.

Tulane offers an executive MBA program in Cali, Colombia; Santiago, Chile; Shanghai, China; and Taipei, Taiwan.

===Environmental sustainability===
Tulane hosted an Environmental Summit at its law school in April 2009, an event that all students could attend for free. Many students from Tulane&#x27;s two active environmental groups, Green Club and Environmental Law Society, attended. These student groups push for global citizenship and environmental stewardship on campus. In 2007 Tulane made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10%, getting students involved by providing an Energy Smart Shopping Guide and electronics &quot;greening&quot; services from IT. In 2010 Tulane completed its renovation of 88-year-old Dinwiddie Hall, which was subsequently LEED Gold certified. A new residential college, Weatherhead Hall, opened in 2011 as housing for sophomore honors students. The residence has also applied for LEED Gold certification. Tulane received an &quot;A−&quot; on the 2011 &quot;College Sustainability Report Card&quot;, garnering an award as one of the top 52 most sustainable colleges in the country.

==Organization and administration==
Tulane University, as a private institution, has been governed since 1884 by the Board of Tulane (also known as the Board of Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund) that was established in 1882. There have been 15 presidents of Tulane since then. The board comprises more than 30 regular members (plus several members emeriti) and the university president. In 2008, Tulane became one of 76 U.S. colleges and the only Louisiana college to maintain an endowment above $1 billion.
Tulane is organized into 10 schools centered around liberal arts, sciences, and specialized professions. All undergraduate students are enrolled in the Newcomb-Tulane College. The graduate programs are governed by the individual schools. Newcomb-Tulane College serves as an administrative center for all aspects of undergraduate life at Tulane, while individual schools direct specific courses of study.

The first architecture courses at Tulane leading to an architectural engineering degree were offered in 1894. After beginning as part of the College of Technology, the Tulane School of Architecture was separately formed as a school in 1953. 

The A.B. Freeman School of Business was named in honor of Alfred Bird Freeman, former chair of the Louisiana Coca-Cola Bottling Co. and a prominent New Orleans philanthropist and civic leader. The business school is ranked 44th nationally and 28th among programs at private universities by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s Best Graduate Schools 2015 edition ranked the MBA program 63rd overall. 

The Tulane University Law School, established in 1847, is the 12th oldest law school in the United States. In 1990, it became the first law school in the United States to mandate pro bono work as a graduation requirement. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2015 edition ranked the School of Law 46th overall and 6th in environmental law, while the 2022 edition ranked the School of Law 60th overall. &quot;The Law School 100&quot; ranks Tulane as 34th, relying on a qualitative (rather than quantitative) assessment. The 2010 Leiter law-school rankings put Tulane at 38th, based on student quality, using LSAT and GPA data. The Hylton law-school rankings, conducted in 2006, put Tulane at 39th. The school&#x27;s maritime law program is widely considered to be the best in the United States, with the &quot;Tulane Maritime Law Journal&quot; being the paramount admiralty law journal of the country. In May 2007, Tulane Law announced a Strategic Plan to increase student selectivity by gradually reducing the incoming JD class size from a historical average of 350 students per year to a target of 250 students per year within several years.

The School of Liberal Arts encompasses 16 departments and 19 interdisciplinary programs in the social sciences, humanities, and fine and performing arts—including 50 undergraduate majors and two dozen M.A., M.F.A., and Ph.D. programs—plus the Shakespeare Festival, Summer Lyric Theatre, Carroll Gallery, Tulane Marching Band, and the Middle America Research Institute. The School of Liberal Arts is the largest of Tulane&#x27;s nine schools with the greatest number of enrolled students, faculty members, majors, minors, and graduate programs.

The Tulane University School of Medicine was founded in 1834 and is the 15th oldest medical school in the United States. Faculty have been noted for innovation. For example, in 1850 J. Lawrence Smith invented the inverted microscope. In the following year John Leonard Riddell invented the first practical microscope to allow binocular viewing through a single objective lens. In 2001 the Tulane Center for Gene Therapy started as the first major center in the U.S. to focus on research using adult stem cells. The school has highly selective admissions, accepting only 175 medical students from more than 10,000 applications. It comprises 20 academic departments.

The Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine is the first public health school established in the U.S. Although a program in hygiene was initiated in 1881, the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was not established until 1912 as a separate entity from the College of Medicine. In 1919 the separate school ceased to be an independent unit and was merged with the College of Medicine. By 1967 the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine reestablished as a separate academic unit of Tulane. In the fall of 2006, the School of Public Health began admitting undergraduate students.

The Tulane University School of Science and Engineering was established in 2005.

In 1914 the Southern School of Social Sciences and Public Services was the first training program for social workers in the Deep South. By 1927 the school became a separate program with a two-year Master of Arts. The Tulane University School of Social Work has awarded the master of social work degrees to more than 4,700 students from all 50 of the United States and more than 30 other countries.

Tulane offers continuing education courses and associate&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degrees through the Tulane School of Professional Advancement. Tulane has several academic and research institutes and centers including The Murphy Institute, Newcomb College Center for Research on Women, The Roger Thayer Stone Center for Latin American Studies, the Middle American Research Institute, and the law school&#x27;s Payson Center for International Development.

==Academics==
As part of the post-Hurricane Katrina Renewal Plan, the university initiated an extensive university-wide core curriculum. Several major elements of the university core include freshman seminars called TIDES classes, a two-tier writing course sequence, and a two-tier course sequence for public service. Many other course requirements of the core curriculum can be certified through Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) exam scores, or placement exams in English and foreign languages offered by the university before course registration. Some schools&#x27; core requirements differ (e.g., students in the School of Science and Engineering are required to take fewer language classes than students in the School of Liberal Arts).

===Research===
Tulane was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1958. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and had research expenditure of $193.3 million in fiscal year 2018.

In 2008, Tulane was ranked by the Ford Foundation as the major international studies research institution in the South and one of the top 15 nationally. The National Institutes of Health ranks funding to Tulane at 79th. The university is home to various research centers, including the Amistad Research Center.

===Admissions===

According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Tulane is deemed a &quot;Most Selective&quot; university. Tulane is the only institution in Louisiana to have that distinction. The school accepts the Common Application for admission. Tulane has the second lowest percentage of Pell Grant recipients in the United States, only after Fairfield University. It is need-blind for domestic applicants.

The Office of Undergraduate Admission received over 43,000 applications for fall 2022 — over a 21 percent increase over the last five years. The acceptance rate for the class of 2026 was 8.4 percent. The yield rate was 52 percent. Among freshman students who committed to enroll in Fall 2022, the average converted SAT score was 1474. Composite ACT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 31 to 34.

====Honors program admissions====
The most impressive incoming undergraduate students are invited to join the honors program by the Office of Admission. Incoming freshmen who did not receive an invitation are allowed to apply for one after completing their first semester with at least a 3.8 cumulative GPA. To remain in good standing with the honors program, honors students are required to maintain at least a 3.8 cumulative GPA and enroll in honors classes their first year in the program. Honors students have access to special privileges and learning opportunities on campus.

In 2021, the Newcomb-Tulane College (NTC) created programming for First Year Honors Scholars and phased out its honors program. Many of the components of the honors program have been incorporated into other NTC programs.

===Scholarships===
The Dean&#x27;s Honor Scholarship is a merit-based scholarship awarded by Tulane which covers full tuition for the duration of the recipient&#x27;s undergraduate program. The scholarship is offered to between 75 and 100 incoming freshmen by the Office of Undergraduate Admission and is awarded only through a separate application. This scholarship is renewable provided that the recipient maintains a minimum 3.0 GPA at the end of each semester and maintains continuous enrollment in a full-time undergraduate division. Typically, recipients have SAT I score of 1450 or higher or an ACT composite score of 33 or higher, rank in the top 5% of their high school graduating class, have a rigorous course load including honors and Advanced Placement classes, and an outstanding record of extracurricular activities. Notable recipients include Sean M. Berkowitz and David Filo.

Beginning in 2014, Tulane has partnered with the Stamps Family Charitable Foundation to offer the full-ride merit-based Stamps Leadership Scholarship, Tulane&#x27;s most prestigious scholarship. Approximately 5 incoming students are awarded the Stamps Scholarship each year, and Tulane graduated its first class of Stamps Scholars in May 2018.

==Student life==

The student body of Tulane University is represented by the Associated Student Body (ASB). In 1998, the students of Tulane University voted by referendum to split the Associated Student Body (ASB) Senate into two separate houses, the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GAPSA). USG and GAPSA came together twice a semester to meet as the ASB Senate, where issues pertaining to the entire Tulane student body were discussed, presided over by the ASB President. However, starting in 2021, Tulane students and administrators collaborated to create a new student governance model. The USG was dissolved, and in its place, the Tulane Undergraduate Assembly (TUA) was formed.

Tulane maintains 3,600 beds in 14 residence halls on its uptown campus for undergraduate students. First year residence halls include Warren House, Sharp Hall, Monroe Hall, Paterson Hall, Josephine Louise Hall, Wall Hall, and Butler Hall. Sophomore residence halls include Aron Residences, Décou-Labat Residences, Greenbaum Hall, Lake Hall, River Hall, and Weatherhead Hall. Per the Renewal Plan instituted after Hurricane Katrina, Tulane requires all freshmen and sophomores to live on campus, except those who are from surrounding neighborhoods in New Orleans. Due to the increasing size of incoming classes, Tulane has allowed a small number of rising sophomores to reside off campus instead of being required to remain in campus housing. Housing is not guaranteed for juniors and seniors.

===Student media===
&quot;The Tulane Hullabaloo&quot; is the university&#x27;s weekly student-run newspaper. 

===Athletics===

Tulane competes in NCAA Division I as a member of the American Athletic Conference (The American). The university was a charter member of the Southeastern Conference, in which it competed until 1966. Just before leaving the SEC, it had notably become the first conference school to field a black athlete when Stephen Martin, who was on an academic scholarship, played on the baseball team in the 1966 season. Tulane, along with other academically oriented, private schools had considered forming the &quot;Southern Ivy League&quot; (Magnolia Conference) in the 1950s. Tulane&#x27;s intercollegiate sports include football, baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and cross country, women&#x27;s swimming and diving, women&#x27;s tennis, women&#x27;s golf, women&#x27;s bowling, and women&#x27;s beach volleyball. Tulane&#x27;s graduation rate for its student-athletes consistently ranks among the top of Division I athletics programs.

Tulane Green Wave teams have seen moderate success over the years. The school&#x27;s national championships have all come from men&#x27;s tennis, with one team title in 1959 and multiple singles and doubles titles. The baseball team has won multiple conference titles, and in both 2001 and 2005, it finished with 56 wins and placed 5th at the College World Series. The women&#x27;s basketball team has won multiple conference titles and gone to numerous NCAA tournaments. The women&#x27;s volleyball team won the 2008 Conference USA Championship tournament. The Green Wave football team won the 2002 Hawaii Bowl, the 1970 Liberty Bowl, and the inaugural Sugar Bowl. In 1998 it went 12–0, winning the Liberty Bowl and finishing the season ranked 7th in the nation by the AP and 10th by the BCS. On January 2, 2023, Tulane beat a favored USC team in the Cotton Bowl, finishing the 2022 season with a 12–2 record.

Most administrative and athletic support facilities are located in the Wilson Athletic Center in the center of Tulane&#x27;s athletic campus. The adjacent area was once home to Tulane Stadium, which seated more than 80,000 people, held three Super Bowls, was home to the New Orleans Saints, and gave rise to the Sugar Bowl. Home football games moved to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome when it opened in 1975, and Tulane Stadium was demolished in 1980. The university has committed to upgrading its athletic facilities in recent years, extensively renovating Turchin Stadium (baseball) in 2008, Fogelman Arena (now Devlin Fieldhouse; basketball and volleyball) in 2006 and 2012, and Goldring Tennis Center in 2008. The Hertz Center, a new practice facility for the basketball and volleyball teams that includes athletic training and strength and conditioning rooms, offices, film rooms, and lockers, opened in 2011. Tulane completed construction of Yulman Stadium in September 2014 and began using it for home football games that season.

Tulane also hosted several prominent faculty, such as two members who each won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: Louis J. Ignarro and Andrew V. Schally. Other notables such as Rudolph Matas, &quot;father of vascular surgery&quot; and George E. Burch, inventor of the phlebomanometer in medicine, also were on faculty at Tulane. Five U.S. Supreme Court Justices have taught at Tulane, including Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Tulane has also hosted several prominent artists, most notably Mark Rothko, who was a Visiting Artist from 1956 to 1957. Currently on the faculty are Walter Isaacson, Nick Spitzer, Olawale Sulaiman and Melissa Harris-Perry.

Several football alumni played in the National Football League, including five-time NFL Champion Wide Receiver Max McGee, Mewelde Moore, Matt Forté, Troy Kropog, Dezman Moses, Cairo Santos (Chicago Bears), Darnell Mooney (Chicago Bears), and Super Bowl champion Shaun King (Tampa Bay).

Several baseball alumni played in the Major Leagues, including Brian Bogusevic (Chicago Cubs), Brandon Gomes (Tampa Bay Rays), Mark Hamilton (free agent), Aaron Loup (Toronto Blue Jays), Tommy Manzella (Colorado Rockies), Micah Owings (Washington Nationals), and J. P. France (Houston Astros).

Actor Harold Sylvester was the first African American to receive an athletic scholarship from Tulane. Turning down Harvard, he attended Tulane on a basketball scholarship and graduated in 1972 with a degree in theater and psychology.

==In literature and media==
Tulane has been portrayed in several books, television shows and films. These films include &quot;The Perfect Date, So Undercover, The Pelican Brief, College,&quot; and &quot;22 Jump Street&quot;. Several movies have been filmed at the Uptown campus, especially since tax credits from the state of Louisiana began drawing more productions to New Orleans in the early 2000s. The Uptown campus has hosted two movie premieres from 2006 to 2007.

<doc id="165381" wikidata="Q616109" url="?curid=165381" title="Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo">
<text>The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo officially ended the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). It was signed on 2 February 1848 in the town of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

After the defeat of its army and the fall of the capital in September 1847, Mexico entered into peace negotiations with the U.S. envoy, Nicholas Trist. The resulting treaty required Mexico to cede 55 percent of its territory including the present-day states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona, and a small portion of Wyoming. Mexico also relinquished all claims for Texas and recognized the Rio Grande as the southern boundary of Texas.

In turn, the U.S. government paid Mexico $15 million &quot;in consideration of the extension acquired by the boundaries of the United States&quot; and agreed to pay debts owed to American citizens by the Mexican government. Mexicans in areas annexed by the U.S. could relocate within Mexico&#x27;s new boundaries or receive American citizenship and full civil rights.

The United States ratified the treaty on 10 March and Mexico on 19 May. The ratifications were exchanged on 30 May, and the treaty was proclaimed on 4 July 1848.

The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty by a vote of 38–14. The opponents of this treaty were led by the Whigs, who had opposed the war and rejected manifest destiny in general, and rejected this expansion in particular. The amount of land gained by the United States from Mexico was further increased due to the Gadsden Purchase of 1853, which ceded parts of present-day southern Arizona and New Mexico to the United States.

==Negotiators==
Nicholas Trist negotiated the peace talks; Trist, the chief clerk of the U.S. State Department, accompanied General Winfield Scott as a diplomat and President James K. Polk&#x27;s representative. After two previous unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a treaty with General José Joaquín de Herrera, Trist and General Scott determined that the only way to deal with Mexico was as a conquered enemy. Trist negotiated with a special commission representing the collapsed government led by José Bernardo Couto, Miguel de Atristain, and Luis Gonzaga Cuevas of Mexico.

==Terms==

Although Mexico ceded Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México, the text of the treaty did not list territories to be ceded and avoided the disputed issues that were causes of war: the validity of the 1836 revolution that established the Republic of Texas, Texas&#x27;s boundary claims as far as the Rio Grande, and the right of the Republic of Texas to arrange the 1845 annexation of Texas by the United States.

Instead, Article V of the treaty described the new U.S.–Mexico border. From east to west, the border consisted of the Rio Grande northwest from its mouth to the point where it strikes the southern boundary of New Mexico (roughly 32 degrees north), as shown in the Disturnell map, then due west from this point to the 110th meridian west, then north along the 110th meridian to the Gila River and down the river to its mouth. Unlike the New Mexico segment of the boundary, which depended partly on unknown geography, &quot;to preclude all difficulty in tracing upon the ground the limit separating Upper from Lower California&quot;, a straight line was drawn from the mouth of the Gila to one marine league south of the southernmost point of the Port of San Diego, slightly north of the previous Mexican provincial boundary at Playas de Rosarito.

Comparing the boundary in the Adams–Onís Treaty to the Guadalupe Hidalgo boundary, Mexico conceded about 55% of its pre-war, pre-Texas territorial claims and now has an area of .

In the United States, the of the area between the Adams-Onís and Guadalupe Hidalgo boundaries outside the claimed by the Republic of Texas is known as the Mexican Cession. That is to say, the Mexican Cession is construed not to include any territory east of the Rio Grande, while the territorial claims of the Republic of Texas included no territory west of the Rio Grande. The Mexican Cession included essentially the entirety of the former Mexican territory of Alta California, but only the western portion of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, and includes all of present-day California, Nevada and Utah, most of Arizona, western portions of New Mexico and Colorado, and the southwestern corner of Wyoming.

Articles VIII and IX ensured the safety of existing property rights of Mexican citizens living in the transferred territories. Despite assurances to the contrary, land grants by the Mexican government to its citizens were often not honored by the United States because of unilateral modifications to and interpretations of the Treaty and U.S. legal decisions. Land disputes between the descendants of Mexican land owners and Anglo Americans continued into the 21st century. The United States also agreed to assume $3.25 million (equivalent to $ million today) in debts that Mexico owed to United States citizens.

The residents had one year to choose whether they wanted American or Mexican citizenship; over 90% chose American citizenship. The others moved to what remained of Mexico (where they received land) or, in some cases in New Mexico, were allowed to remain in place as Mexican citizens.

Article XII engaged the United States to pay, &quot;In consideration of the extension acquired&quot;, 15 million dollars (equivalent to $ million today), in annual installments of 3 million dollars.

Article XI of the treaty was important to Mexico. It provided that the United States would prevent and punish raids by Indians into Mexico, prohibited Americans from acquiring property, including livestock, taken by the Indians in those raids, and stated that the United States would return captives of the Indians to Mexico. Mexicans believed that the United States had encouraged and assisted the Comanche and Apache raids that had devastated northern Mexico in the years before the war. This article promised relief to them.

Article XI, however, proved unenforceable. Destructive Indian raids continued despite a heavy U.S. presence near the Mexican border. Mexico filed 366 claims with the U.S. government for damages done by Comanche and Apache raids between 1848 and 1853. In 1853, in the Treaty of Mesilla concluding the Gadsden Purchase, Article XI was annulled.

===Results===
The land that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo brought into the United States became, between 1850 and 1912, all or part of nine states: California (1850), Nevada (1864), Utah (1896), and Arizona (1912), as well as, depending upon interpretation, the entire state of Texas (1845), which then included part of Kansas (1861); Colorado (1876); Wyoming (1890); Oklahoma (1907); and New Mexico (1912). The area of domain acquired was given by the Federal Interagency Committee as 338,680,960 acres. The cost was $16,295,149 or approximately 5 cents an acre. The remainder (the southern parts) of New Mexico and Arizona were peacefully acquired under the Gadsden Purchase, which was carried out in 1853. In this transfer the United States paid an additional $10 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for land intended to accommodate a transcontinental railroad. However, the American Civil War delayed the construction of such a route, and it was not until 1881 that the Southern Pacific Railroad finally was completed as a second transcontinental railroad, fulfilling the purpose of the acquisition.

==Background to the war==
Mexico had claimed the area in question since winning its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. The Spanish had conquered part of the area from the American Indian tribes over the preceding three centuries. Still, powerful and independent indigenous nations remained within that northern region of Mexico.

Most of that land was too dry and too mountainous to support a large population. About 80,000 Mexicans inhabited California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas during the period 1845 to 1850, with far fewer in Nevada, southern and western Colorado, and Utah. On 1 March 1845, U.S. President John Tyler signed legislation to authorize the United States to annex the Republic of Texas, effective on 29 December 1845. The Mexican government, which had never recognized the Republic of Texas as an independent country, had warned that annexation would be viewed as an act of war. Both the United Kingdom and France recognized the Republic of Texas&#x27;s independence and repeatedly tried to dissuade Mexico from declaring war against its northern neighbor. British efforts to mediate the quandary proved fruitless, in part because other political disputes (particularly the Oregon boundary dispute) arose between Great Britain (as the claimant of modern Canada) and the United States.

On 10 November 1845, before the outbreak of hostilities, President James K. Polk sent his envoy, John Slidell, to Mexico. Slidell had instructions to offer Mexico around $5 million for the territory of Nuevo México and up to $40 million for Alta California. The Mexican government dismissed Slidell, refusing to even meet with him. Earlier in that year, Mexico had broken off diplomatic relations with the United States, based partly on its interpretation of the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, under which newly independent Mexico claimed it had inherited rights. In that agreement, the United States had &quot;renounced forever&quot; all claims to Spanish territory.

Neither side took any further action to avoid a war. Meanwhile, Polk settled a major territorial dispute with Britain via the Oregon Treaty, which was signed on 15 June 1846. By avoiding any chance of conflict with Great Britain, the United States was given a free hand regarding Mexico. After the Thornton Affair of 25–26 April, when Mexican forces attacked an American unit in the disputed area, with the result that 11 Americans were killed, five wounded, and 49 captured, Congress passed a declaration of war, which Polk signed on 13 May 1846. The Mexican Congress responded with its own war declaration on 23 April 1846.

==Conduct of war==

U.S. forces quickly moved beyond Texas to conquer Alta California, and New Mexico. Fighting there ended on 13 January 1847 with the signing of the &quot;Capitulation Agreement&quot; at &quot;Campo de Cahuenga&quot; and the end of the Taos Revolt. By the middle of September 1847, U.S. forces had successfully invaded central Mexico and occupied Mexico City.

===Peace negotiations===
Some Eastern Democrats called for complete annexation of Mexico and recalled that a group of Mexico&#x27;s leading citizens had invited General Winfield Scott to become dictator of Mexico after his capture of Mexico City (he declined). However, the movement did not draw widespread support. President Polk&#x27;s State of the Union address in December 1847 upheld Mexican independence and argued at length that occupation and any further military operations in Mexico were aimed at securing a treaty ceding California and New Mexico up to approximately the 32nd parallel north and possibly Baja California and transit rights across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

Despite several military defeats, the Mexican government was reluctant to agree to the loss of California and New Mexico. Even with its capital under enemy occupation, the Mexican government was inclined to consider factors such as the unwillingness of the U.S. administration to annex Mexico outright and what appeared to be deep divisions in domestic U.S. opinion regarding the war and its aims, which caused it to imagine that it was actually in a far better negotiating position than the military situation might have suggested. A further consideration was the growing opposition to slavery that had caused Mexico to end formal slavery in 1829 and its awareness of the well-known and growing sectional divide in the U.S. over the issue of slavery. It, therefore, made sense for Mexico to negotiate to play Northern U.S. interests against Southern U.S. interests.

The Mexicans proposed peace terms that offered only the sale of Alta California north of the 37th parallel north — north of Santa Cruz, California and Madera, California and the southern boundaries of today&#x27;s Utah and Colorado. Anglo-American settlers already dominated this territory, but perhaps more importantly from the Mexican point of view, it represented the bulk of pre-war Mexican territory north of the Missouri Compromise line of parallel 36°30′ north — lands that, if annexed by the United States, would have been presumed by Northerners to be forever free of slavery. The Mexicans also offered to recognize the freedom of Texas from Mexican rule and its right to join the Union but held to its demand of the Nueces River as a boundary.

While the Mexican government could not reasonably have expected the Polk Administration to accept such terms, it would have had reason to hope that a rejection of peace terms so favorable to Northern interests might have the potential to provoke sectional conflict in the United States or perhaps even a civil war that would fatally undermine the U.S. military position in Mexico. Instead, these terms, combined with other Mexican demands (in particular, for various indemnities), only provoked widespread indignation throughout the United States without causing the sectional conflict the Mexicans hoped for.

Jefferson Davis advised Polk that if Mexico appointed commissioners to come to the United States, the government that appointed them would probably be overthrown before they completed their mission, and they would likely be shot as traitors on their return; so that the only hope of peace was to have a U.S. representative in Mexico. Nicholas Trist, chief clerk of the State Department under President Polk, finally negotiated a treaty with the Mexican delegation after ignoring his recall by President Polk in frustration with the failure to secure a treaty. Notwithstanding that the treaty had been negotiated against his instructions, given its achievement of the major American aim, President Polk passed it on to the Senate.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed by Nicholas Trist (on behalf of the United States) and Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain as plenipotentiary representatives of Mexico on 2 February 1848 at the main altar of the old Basilica of Guadalupe at Villa Hidalgo (within the present city limits) as U.S. troops under the command of Gen. Winfield Scott were occupying Mexico City.

===Debate in the American Congress===

The version of the treaty ratified by the United States Senate eliminated Article X, which stated that the U.S. government would honor and guarantee all land grants awarded in lands ceded to the United States by those respective governments to citizens of Spain and Mexico. Article VIII guaranteed that Mexicans who remained more than one year in the ceded lands would automatically become full-fledged United States citizens (or they could declare their intention of remaining Mexican citizens); however, the Senate modified Article IX, changing the first paragraph and excluding the last two. Among the changes was that Mexican citizens would &quot;be admitted at the proper time (to be judged of by the Congress of the United States)&quot; instead of &quot;admitted as soon as possible&quot;, as negotiated between Trist and the Mexican delegation.

An amendment by Jefferson Davis giving the United States most of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León, all of Coahuila, and a large part of Chihuahua was supported by both senators from Texas (Sam Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk), Daniel S. Dickinson of New York, Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana, and one each from Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri, and Tennessee. Most of the leaders of the Democratic party, Thomas Hart Benton, John C. Calhoun, Herschel V. Johnson, Lewis Cass, James Murray Mason of Virginia and Ambrose Hundley Sevier were opposed, and the amendment was defeated 44–11.

An amendment by Whig Sen. George Edmund Badger of North Carolina to exclude New Mexico and California lost 35–15, with three Southern Whigs voting with the Democrats. Daniel Webster was bitter that four New England senators made deciding votes for acquiring the new territories.

A motion to insert into the treaty the Wilmot Proviso (banning slavery from the acquired territories) failed 15–38 on sectional lines.

The treaty was leaked to John Nugent before the U.S. Senate could approve it. Nugent published his article in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; and, afterward, was questioned by senators. He was detained in a Senate committee room for one month, though he continued to file articles for his newspaper and ate and slept at the home of the sergeant at arms. Nugent did not reveal his source, and senators eventually gave up their efforts.

The treaty was subsequently ratified by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 38 to 14 on 10 March 1848 and by Mexico through a legislative vote of 51 to 34 and a Senate vote of 33 to 4, on 19 May 1848. News that New Mexico&#x27;s legislative assembly had just passed an act for the organization of a U.S. territorial government helped ease Mexican concern about abandoning the people of New Mexico. The treaty was formally proclaimed on 4 July 1848.

===Debate in the Mexican Congress===

The Mexican Congress and President Manuel de la Peña y Peña met at Querétaro City in May, 1848 while Mexico City was occupied, and were now faced with the task of negotiating the treaty while dealing with separatism and anarchy spreading throughout the country. The Caste War was ongoing in Yucatán, and the insurgents in that conflict had occupied the major cities. Many states considered the federal government to be an enemy and refused to pay taxes. Meanwhile, most notably in the Federal District there was a Mexican element advocating annexation of the entire country to the United States.

The majority of congress supported the government&#x27;s peace policy viewing in the Treaty of Guadalupe nothing but the unfortunate result of a poorly fought war, and viewed under this perspective as a national necessity. A foreign relations commission returned affirmative answers to two questions that congress had directed it to report upon: &quot;May the government with the consent of Congress cede a portion of territory? Is it suitable to make peace upon the terms which have been proposed?&quot; The first question was resolved based upon the principle that congress was the deposit of the national sovereignty. The second question was resolved upon the consideration that Mexico had never been in full possession of the territories that were about to be ceded, and that most of that land was either not populated, or populated by hostile indigenous tribes. It was also taken into account that Mexico could not continue the war without facing certain defeat and risking the loss of the entire country.
After the commission reported its findings, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was approved by congress. President Peña y Peña prepared decrees to prevent disorder in the capital once the occupiers left and to establish a national guard. On 26 May 1848 the government received the commissioners Nathan Clifford and Ambrose Hundley Sevier who were in Mexico to negotiate the treaty after congress had approved it with some slight modifications.

Meanwhile, the President had to deal with guerilla warfare throughout the country afflicting both the American occupiers and Mexican merchants. The aim of the guerillas was to disrupt the American supply chain from Veracruz to the capital. This was also leading to indiscriminate American reprisals. As the peace treaty was concluded and the occupiers were on the point of leaving the country, congress named Jose Joaquin Herrera to the presidency of the republic, and Peña y Peña left his post as president in exchange for the presidency of the Supreme Court on 3 June 1848. The government left Querétaro and returned to the capital.

===Protocol of Querétaro===
On 30 May 1848, when the two countries exchanged ratifications of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, they further negotiated a three-article protocol to explain the amendments. The first article stated that the original Article IX of the treaty, although replaced by Article III of the Treaty of Louisiana, would still confer the rights delineated in Article IX. The second article confirmed the legitimacy of land grants pursuant to Mexican law.

The protocol further noted that the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs had accepted said explanations on behalf of the Mexican Government, and was signed in Querétaro by A. H. Sevier, Nathan Clifford and Luis de la Rosa.

The United States would later ignore the protocol on the grounds that the U.S. representatives had over-reached their authority in agreeing to it.

===Treaty of Mesilla===
The Treaty of Mesilla, which concluded the Gadsden purchase of 1854, had significant implications for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Article II of the treaty annulled article XI of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and article IV further annulled articles VI and VII of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Article V, however, reaffirmed the property guarantees of Guadalupe Hidalgo, specifically those contained within articles VIII and IX.

==Effects==

In addition to the sale of land, the treaty also provided recognition of the Rio Grande as the boundary between the state of Texas and Mexico. The land boundaries were established by a survey team of appointed Mexican and American representatives, and published in three volumes as the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey. On 30 December 1853, the countries, by agreement, altered the border from the initial one by increasing the number of border markers from 6 to 53. Most of these markers were simply piles of stones. Two later conventions, in 1882 and 1889, further clarified the boundaries, as some of the markers had been moved or destroyed. Photographers were brought in to document the location of the markers. These photographs are in Record Group 77, Records of the Office of the Chief Engineers, in the National Archives.

The southern border of California was designated as a line from the junction of the Colorado and Gila rivers westward to the Pacific Ocean so that it passes one Spanish league south of the southernmost portion of San Diego Bay. This was done to ensure that the United States received San Diego and its excellent natural harbor.

The treaty extended the choice of U.S. citizenship to Mexicans in the newly purchased territories before many African Americans, Asians, and Native Americans were eligible. If they chose to, they had to declare to the U.S. government within a year of the Treaty being signed; otherwise, they could remain Mexican citizens, but they would have to relocate. Between 1850 and 1920, the U.S. Census counted most Mexicans as racially &quot;white&quot;.

Community property rights in California and other western states are based on the Visigothic Code which Spain adopted and then brought to the Americas, including the former territories of Mexico that were ceded to the U.S. Although each state had different motivations for adopting the Spanish approach, one common driver was that it was already in place in the region for many years. According to a 2011 assessment, changing to a common law system for marital property &quot;would have been nothing short of a revolution&quot;.

===Land gained by the United States===

The United States received the territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México. Today they comprise some or all of the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. While this land was vast in area, most of it was very sparsely populated, inhabited mostly by indigenous Americans, rather than white Americans or Mexicans.

===Additional issues===
Additional issues stemming from the treaty included contention over slavery, border disputes with Mexico, mapping difficulties, cross-border incursions by both nations, community land grant claims, and water rights assignment between the two nations.

Disputes about whether to make all this new territory into slave states and free states or slave states, including Bleeding Kansas, contributed heavily to the rise in North–South tensions that led to the American Civil War just over a decade later.

Border disputes continued. Mexico&#x27;s economic problems persisted, leading to the controversial Gadsden Purchase in 1854, intended to rectify an error in the original treaty, but led to Mexico demanding a large sum of money for the revision, which was paid. There was also William Walker&#x27;s short-lived Republic of Lower California filibustering incident in that same year. 

The border commission also faced many difficulties in mapping out the boundary, with the surveying process lasting over 7 years, due to the challenges of marking out a border in such a vast desolate territory and negotiating with indigenous Americans who had not been considered in the prior treaty negotiations.

The Channel Islands of California and Farallon Islands are not mentioned in the Treaty. 

The armed forces of both countries routinely crossed the border. Mexican and Confederate troops often clashed during the American Civil War, and the United States crossed the border during the war of Second French intervention in Mexico. In March 1916, Pancho Villa led a raid on the U.S. border town of Columbus, New Mexico, which was followed by the Pershing expedition. The shifting of the Rio Grande since the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe caused a dispute over the boundary between the states of New Mexico and Texas, a case referred to as the Country Club Dispute that was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1927. 

Controversy over community land grant claims in New Mexico persists to this day.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo led to the establishment in 1889 of the International Boundary and Water Commission to maintain the border and, according to newer treaties, to allocate river waters between the two nations and to provide for flood control and water sanitation. Once viewed as a model of international cooperation, in recent decades, the IBWC has been heavily criticized as an institutional anachronism, bypassed by modern social, environmental, and political issues.

Writing many years later, Nicholas Trist would describe the Treaty as &quot;a thing for every right-minded American to be ashamed of&quot;.

<text>Peter Leslie Osgood (20 February 1947 – 1 March 2006) was an English footballer who was active during the 1960s and 1970s. He is best remembered for representing Chelsea and Southampton as a forward at club level, winning the FA Cup with each, and was also capped four times by England in the early 1970s.

== Personal life==
Osgood was born at 26 East Crescent, Clewer, Windsor, Berkshire to Leslie Frank Herbert and Ivy Lilian (née Comley). He attended Clewer Green primary school in Hatch Lane, Windsor, and Dedworth secondary modern school. Osgood described himself as a tearaway and as not the brainiest kid at school (although he was captain at most sports) and was working as a bricklayer and playing football for Windsor when his uncle wrote to Chelsea on his behalf to secure a trial.

Osgood was married three times: 
*to Rosemary Heather Snow on 19 December 1964, with whom he had two children, Anthony and Mark. They married in Windsor Registry Office on a wintry Saturday morning. On the same afternoon he played for Chelsea against Peterborough, scoring a hat-trick in a 6–1 victory.
*to Philippa Cooke-Smith on 17 October 1980.
*to Lynette Ann Finlay on 1 June 1987, with whom he had one son, Darren.

==Playing career==
===Chelsea===
Osgood had a previous trial with Arsenal, but said that he tore the papers up because he was happy playing for Windsor and working on building sites, and didn&#x27;t fancy the travel. Osgood was signed in February 1964 by Chelsea as a junior and made his debut as a 17-year-old in the League Cup, scoring both goals in a 2–0 win against Workington AFC on 16 December 1964. The buzz surrounding the tall, skilful teenager&#x27;s goalscoring for the club&#x27;s reserves – 30 goals in 20 games going into that month – was already immense, and he soon became a regular first-teamer.

Following an end-of-season tour of Australia during which Osgood scored 12 times in eight games, the centre-forward&#x27;s next senior match was the 22 September 1965 4–1 victory over AS Roma in the Inter-City Fairs Cup (a violent encounter dubbed &quot;the Battle of the Bridge&quot;). A run in the league followed, bringing seven goals, including one involving a 60-yard run past a number of Burnley players.

The teenager was soon hailed as a possible late call-up for Alf Ramsey&#x27;s 1966 World Cup squad, having been included in the original 40-man squad announced in April 1966, but he was not included in the final 22.

A broken leg suffered in a challenge by Blackpool&#x27;s Emlyn Hughes in the League Cup on 5 October 1966 seriously curtailed his progress, and he missed Chelsea&#x27;s first-ever Wembley FA Cup final on 20 May 1967. Chelsea lost to Tottenham Hotspur 2–1. This was a major disappointment for Osgood, but after he returned from the injury his abilities were recognised by new manager Dave Sexton playing him often as a midfielder, notably wearing the number 4 shirt for most of the 1968– 69 season (reference page 70 &#x27;Ossie – King of Stamford Bridge&#x27; written with Martin Knight and Martin King ), but it is as a goalscoring centre-forward that he is best remembered. He was given the nickname &quot;the Wizard of Os&quot;.

In total, Osgood made 289 appearances for &quot;The Blues&quot;, scoring 105 goals. He was one of only nine players to score in every round of the FA Cup (and, to date, the last to do so), helping Chelsea to victory in a replayed final against Leeds United in 1970. He scored Chelsea&#x27;s equaliser in the second game at Old Trafford with a diving header from Charlie Cooke&#x27;s chipped pass twelve minutes from full-time; his side eventually won 2–1.

In 1971, Osgood was part of the Chelsea team which lifted the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, defeating Real Madrid 2–1 in a replay in Athens after the original tie had finished 1–1, with Osgood scoring Chelsea&#x27;s goal in that game. In the replay he scored again, the second goal to put Chelsea 2–0 up, as they went on to win 2–1. In 1972, he scored for Chelsea in a major cup final for the third consecutive year – this time the League Cup – though they lost 2–1 to Stoke City. Chelsea declined as a major force thereafter, but Osgood continued to score regularly; his volley from outside the area against Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final was voted BBC goal of the season in 1972–73. As a young player in the 1960s, Osgood enjoyed the trappings of fame, boozy nights out, gambling and owned a racing greyhound called Railroad Billy.

===Southampton, Norwich and return to Chelsea===
Following a series of disagreements with manager Dave Sexton over his lifestyle (during which supporters picketed Stamford Bridge to demand he stay) Osgood, along with several of his teammates, was dropped from the squad and placed on the transfer list. He was sold to Southampton in March 1974 for a club-record £275,000. During his time on the south coast, he won the FA Cup again in 1976 after a 1–0 victory over Manchester United. He left Southampton in November 1977, shortly before the club were promoted. He scored 36 goals in 161 games for the Saints. Towards the end of his career, he also had a brief loan spell at Norwich City.

Osgood signed a US $90,000 contract with the Philadelphia Fury on 12 December 1977. High taxes were the primary reason for his departure from England. He returned to Chelsea in December 1978 following a disappointing stint in the United States with the Fury where he scored only one goal in 23 matches for a team which also included Alan Ball and Johnny Giles. On his return to Stamford Bridge, the club were in deep decline and facing a relegation battle. He again scored on his debut to put his team ahead, though Chelsea still lost 7–2 to Middlesbrough. He stayed with the club for the rest of the season before retiring in December 1979.

===England===
In spite of his talent and goalscoring prowess, Osgood&#x27;s England career was surprisingly limited, with England manager Alf Ramsey apparently disapproving of his playboy lifestyle. As a result, he only won four international caps, without scoring. Osgood made his England debut in February 1970 in a 3–1 win over Belgium. He was a member of the 1970 World Cup squad, making two appearances against Czechoslovakia and Romania as a substitute.

==Retirement==

In 1981, Osgood opened a pub in Windsor, the Union Inn, with his old strike partner Ian Hutchinson. In the 1990s, Osgood and many of his 1970s colleagues were banned from Stamford Bridge by chairman Ken Bates for perceived criticism of the club. Osgood returned to his role as hospitality host on matchdays in 2003.

Osgood was commonly called &quot;Ossie&quot; and also earned the nickname &quot;The King of Stamford Bridge&quot; due to his exceptional skills as a player as well as his personality and status. His autobiography &#x27;Ossie – King of Stamford Bridge&#x27; written with Martin Knight and Martin King was released in 2003 and in 2004 Osgood appeared in a cameo role in the British film &quot;The Football Factory&quot;.

Prior to his death on 1 March 2006 following a heart attack at a family funeral, he was involved in football-related media work and was well known on the after dinner speaker circuit. Three weeks before his death he had enjoyed a standing ovation when presented to the Stamford Bridge crowd at half-time of a match.

At Chelsea&#x27;s first home game after Osgood&#x27;s death, against local rivals Tottenham, there were many tributes as well as a minute&#x27;s applause. Many of his former teammates were in attendance and the matchday programme ran a tribute to him. Chelsea ran out 2–1 winners after a last-minute goal by William Gallas. Fans sang the chant in honour of Osgood to the tune of &#x27;The First Noel&#x27;.

In a memorial service on Sunday, 1 October 2006, Peter Osgood&#x27;s ashes were buried under the penalty spot at the Shed End of Stamford Bridge. Over 2700 fans attended the memorial service and they were joined by former managers, chairmen, players, colleagues and current Chelsea players. In December 2007 in a 4–4 draw against Aston Villa, Andriy Shevchenko scored the first penalty kick at the Shed End since Osgood&#x27;s ashes were buried there.

On 24 September 2010, Chelsea revealed that the Peter Osgood statue had been completed and it was to be situated outside the West Stand. A week later there was a private unveiling of the statue, attended by Osgood&#x27;s friends and family, and a day later the statue was available for public viewing.

<text>In physics and materials science, the Curie temperature (&quot;T&quot;C), or Curie point, is the temperature above which certain materials lose their permanent magnetic properties, which can (in most cases) be replaced by induced magnetism. The Curie temperature is named after Pierre Curie, who showed that magnetism is lost at a critical temperature.

The force of magnetism is determined by the magnetic moment, a dipole moment within an atom that originates from the angular momentum and spin of electrons. Materials have different structures of intrinsic magnetic moments that depend on temperature; the Curie temperature is the critical point at which a material&#x27;s intrinsic magnetic moments change direction.

Permanent magnetism is caused by the alignment of magnetic moments, and induced magnetism is created when disordered magnetic moments are forced to align in an applied magnetic field. For example, the ordered magnetic moments (ferromagnetic, Figure 1) change and become disordered (paramagnetic, Figure 2) at the Curie temperature. Higher temperatures make magnets weaker, as spontaneous magnetism only occurs below the Curie temperature. Magnetic susceptibility above the Curie temperature can be calculated from the Curie–Weiss law, which is derived from Curie&#x27;s law.

In analogy to ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials, the Curie temperature can also be used to describe the phase transition between ferroelectricity and paraelectricity. In this context, the order parameter is the &quot;electric&quot; polarization that goes from a finite value to zero when the temperature is increased above the Curie temperature.

== Curie temperatures of materials ==
== History ==
That heating destroys magnetism was already described in &quot;De Magnete&quot; (1600):Iron filings, after being heated for a long time, are attracted by a loadstone, yet not so strongly or from so great a distance as when not heated. A loadstone loses some of its virtue by too great a heat; for its humour is set free, whence its peculiar nature is marred. (Book 2, Chapter 23).

== Magnetic moments ==

At the atomic level, there are two contributors to the magnetic moment, the electron magnetic moment and the nuclear magnetic moment. Of these two terms, the electron magnetic moment dominates, and the nuclear magnetic moment is insignificant. At higher temperatures, electrons have higher thermal energy. This has a randomizing effect on aligned magnetic domains, leading to the disruption of order, and the phenomena of the Curie point.

Ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials have different intrinsic magnetic moment structures. At a material&#x27;s specific Curie temperature (), these properties change. The transition from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic (or vice versa) occurs at the Néel temperature (), which is analogous to Curie temperature.

== Materials with magnetic moments that change properties at the Curie temperature ==

Ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic structures are made up of intrinsic magnetic moments. If all the electrons within the structure are paired, these moments cancel out due to their opposite spins and angular momenta. Thus, even with an applied magnetic field, these materials have different properties and no Curie temperature.

=== Paramagnetic ===
A material is paramagnetic only above its Curie temperature. Paramagnetic materials are non-magnetic when a magnetic field is absent and magnetic when a magnetic field is applied. When a magnetic field is absent, the material has disordered magnetic moments; that is, the magnetic moments are asymmetrical and not aligned. When a magnetic field is present, the magnetic moments are temporarily realigned parallel to the applied field; the magnetic moments are symmetrical and aligned. The magnetic moments being aligned in the same direction are what causes an induced magnetic field.

For paramagnetism, this response to an applied magnetic field is positive and is known as magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic susceptibility only applies above the Curie temperature for disordered states.

Sources of paramagnetism (materials which have Curie temperatures) include:
* All atoms that have unpaired electrons;
* Atoms that have inner shells that are incomplete in electrons;
* Free radicals;
* Metals.

Above the Curie temperature, the atoms are excited, and the spin orientations become randomized but can be realigned by an applied field, i.e., the material becomes paramagnetic. Below the Curie temperature, the intrinsic structure has undergone a phase transition, the atoms are ordered, and the material is ferromagnetic. The paramagnetic materials&#x27; induced magnetic fields are very weak compared with ferromagnetic materials&#x27; magnetic fields.

=== Ferromagnetic ===
Materials are only ferromagnetic below their corresponding Curie temperatures. Ferromagnetic materials are magnetic in the absence of an applied magnetic field.

When a magnetic field is absent the material has spontaneous magnetization which is a result of the ordered magnetic moments; that is, for ferromagnetism, the atoms are symmetrical and aligned in the same direction creating a permanent magnetic field.

The magnetic interactions are held together by exchange interactions; otherwise thermal disorder would overcome the weak interactions of magnetic moments. The exchange interaction has a zero probability of parallel electrons occupying the same point in time, implying a preferred parallel alignment in the material. The Boltzmann factor contributes heavily as it prefers interacting particles to be aligned in the same direction. This causes ferromagnets to have strong magnetic fields and high Curie temperatures of around .

Below the Curie temperature, the atoms are aligned and parallel, causing spontaneous magnetism; the material is ferromagnetic. Above the Curie temperature the material is paramagnetic, as the atoms lose their ordered magnetic moments when the material undergoes a phase transition.

=== Ferrimagnetic ===
Materials are only ferrimagnetic below their corresponding Curie temperature. Ferrimagnetic materials are magnetic in the absence of an applied magnetic field and are made up of two different ions.

When a magnetic field is absent the material has a spontaneous magnetism which is the result of ordered magnetic moments; that is, for ferrimagnetism one ion&#x27;s magnetic moments are aligned facing in one direction with certain magnitude and the other ion&#x27;s magnetic moments are aligned facing in the opposite direction with a different magnitude. As the magnetic moments are of different magnitudes in opposite directions there is still a spontaneous magnetism and a magnetic field is present.

Similar to ferromagnetic materials the magnetic interactions are held together by exchange interactions. The orientations of moments however are anti-parallel which results in a net momentum by subtracting their momentum from one another.

Below the Curie temperature the atoms of each ion are aligned anti-parallel with different momentums causing a spontaneous magnetism; the material is ferrimagnetic. Above the Curie temperature the material is paramagnetic as the atoms lose their ordered magnetic moments as the material undergoes a phase transition.

=== Antiferromagnetic and the Néel temperature ===
Materials are only antiferromagnetic below their corresponding Néel temperature or magnetic ordering temperature, &quot;T&quot;N. This is similar to the Curie temperature as above the Néel Temperature the material undergoes a phase transition and becomes paramagnetic. That is, the thermal energy becomes large enough to destroy the microscopic magnetic ordering within the material. It is named after Louis Néel (1904–2000), who received the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in the area.

The material has equal magnetic moments aligned in opposite directions resulting in a zero magnetic moment and a net magnetism of zero at all temperatures below the Néel temperature. Antiferromagnetic materials are weakly magnetic in the absence or presence of an applied magnetic field.

Similar to ferromagnetic materials the magnetic interactions are held together by exchange interactions preventing thermal disorder from overcoming the weak interactions of magnetic moments. When disorder occurs it is at the Néel temperature.

Listed below are the Néel temperatures of several materials:
== Curie–Weiss law ==

The Curie–Weiss law is an adapted version of Curie&#x27;s law.

The Curie–Weiss law is a simple model derived from a mean-field approximation, this means it works well for the materials temperature, , much greater than their corresponding Curie temperature, , i.e. ; it however fails to describe the magnetic susceptibility, , in the immediate vicinity of the Curie point because of correlations in the fluctuations of neighboring magnetic moments.

Neither Curie&#x27;s law nor the Curie–Weiss law holds for .

Curie&#x27;s law for a paramagnetic material:

formula_1

The Curie constant is defined as
formula_2
The Curie–Weiss law is then derived from Curie&#x27;s law to be:

formula_3

where:

formula_4

 is the Weiss molecular field constant.

For full derivation see Curie–Weiss law.

== Physics ==

=== Approaching Curie temperature from above ===

As the Curie–Weiss law is an approximation, a more accurate model is needed when the temperature, , approaches the material&#x27;s Curie temperature, .

Magnetic susceptibility occurs above the Curie temperature.

An accurate model of critical behaviour for magnetic susceptibility with critical exponent :

formula_5

The critical exponent differs between materials and for the mean-field model is taken as  = 1.

As temperature is inversely proportional to magnetic susceptibility, when approaches the denominator tends to zero and the magnetic susceptibility approaches infinity allowing magnetism to occur. This is a spontaneous magnetism which is a property of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials.

=== Approaching Curie temperature from below ===

Magnetism depends on temperature and spontaneous magnetism occurs below the Curie temperature. An accurate model of critical behaviour for spontaneous magnetism with critical exponent :

formula_6

The critical exponent differs between materials and for the mean-field model as taken as  =  where .

The spontaneous magnetism approaches zero as the temperature increases towards the materials Curie temperature.

=== Approaching absolute zero (0 kelvin) ===

The spontaneous magnetism, occurring in ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials, approaches zero as the temperature increases towards the material&#x27;s Curie temperature. Spontaneous magnetism is at its maximum as the temperature approaches 0 K. That is, the magnetic moments are completely aligned and at their strongest magnitude of magnetism due to lack of thermal disturbance.

In paramagnetic materials thermal energy is sufficient to overcome the ordered alignments. As the temperature approaches 0 K, the entropy decreases to zero, that is, the disorder decreases and the material becomes ordered. This occurs without the presence of an applied magnetic field and obeys the third law of thermodynamics.

Both Curie&#x27;s law and the Curie–Weiss law fail as the temperature approaches 0 K. This is because they depend on the magnetic susceptibility, which only applies when the state is disordered.

Gadolinium sulfate continues to satisfy Curie&#x27;s law at 1 K. Between 0 and 1 K the law fails to hold and a sudden change in the intrinsic structure occurs at the Curie temperature.

=== Ising model of phase transitions ===

The Ising model is mathematically based and can analyse the critical points of phase transitions in ferromagnetic order due to spins of electrons having magnitudes of ±. The spins interact with their neighbouring dipole electrons in the structure and here the Ising model can predict their behaviour with each other.

This model is important for solving and understanding the concepts of phase transitions and hence solving the Curie temperature. As a result, many different dependencies that affect the Curie temperature can be analysed.

For example, the surface and bulk properties depend on the alignment and magnitude of spins and the Ising model can determine the effects of magnetism in this system.

One should note, in 1D the Curie (critical) temperature for a magnetic order phase transition is found to be at zero temperature, i.e. the magnetic order takes over only at = 0. In 2D, the critical temperature, e.g. a finite magnetization, can be calculated by solving the inequality:

formula_7

=== Weiss domains and surface and bulk Curie temperatures ===

Materials structures consist of intrinsic magnetic moments which are separated into domains called Weiss domains. This can result in ferromagnetic materials having no spontaneous magnetism as domains could potentially balance each other out. The position of particles can therefore have different orientations around the surface than the main part (bulk) of the material. This property directly affects the Curie temperature as there can be a bulk Curie temperature and a different surface Curie temperature for a material.

This allows for the surface Curie temperature to be ferromagnetic above the bulk Curie temperature when the main state is disordered, i.e. ordered and disordered states occur simultaneously.

The surface and bulk properties can be predicted by the Ising model and electron capture spectroscopy can be used to detect the electron spins and hence the magnetic moments on the surface of the material. An average total magnetism is taken from the bulk and surface temperatures to calculate the Curie temperature from the material, noting the bulk contributes more.

The angular momentum of an electron is either + or − due to it having a spin of , which gives a specific size of magnetic moment to the electron; the Bohr magneton. Electrons orbiting around the nucleus in a current loop create a magnetic field which depends on the Bohr magneton and magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the magnetic moments are related between angular and orbital momentum and affect each other. Angular momentum contributes twice as much to magnetic moments than orbital.

For terbium which is a rare-earth metal and has a high orbital angular momentum the magnetic moment is strong enough to affect the order above its bulk temperatures. It is said to have a high anisotropy on the surface, that is it is highly directed in one orientation. It remains ferromagnetic on its surface above its Curie temperature (219 K) while its bulk becomes antiferromagnetic and then at higher temperatures its surface remains antiferromagnetic above its bulk Néel Temperature (230 K) before becoming completely disordered and paramagnetic with increasing temperature. The anisotropy in the bulk is different from its surface anisotropy just above these phase changes as the magnetic moments will be ordered differently or ordered in paramagnetic materials.

=== Changing a material&#x27;s Curie temperature ===

==== Composite materials ====

Composite materials, that is, materials composed from other materials with different properties, can change the Curie temperature. For example, a composite which has silver in it can create spaces for oxygen molecules in bonding which decreases the Curie temperature as the crystal lattice will not be as compact.

The alignment of magnetic moments in the composite material affects the Curie temperature. If the material&#x27;s moments are parallel with each other, the Curie temperature will increase and if perpendicular the Curie temperature will decrease as either more or less thermal energy will be needed to destroy the alignments.

Preparing composite materials through different temperatures can result in different final compositions which will have different Curie temperatures. Doping a material can also affect its Curie temperature.

The density of nanocomposite materials changes the Curie temperature. Nanocomposites are compact structures on a nano-scale. The structure is built up of high and low bulk Curie temperatures, however will only have one mean-field Curie temperature. A higher density of lower bulk temperatures results in a lower mean-field Curie temperature, and a higher density of higher bulk temperature significantly increases the mean-field Curie temperature. In more than one dimension the Curie temperature begins to increase as the magnetic moments will need more thermal energy to overcome the ordered structure.

==== Particle size ====

The size of particles in a material&#x27;s crystal lattice changes the Curie temperature. Due to the small size of particles (nanoparticles) the fluctuations of electron spins become more prominent, which results in the Curie temperature drastically decreasing when the size of particles decreases, as the fluctuations cause disorder. The size of a particle also affects the anisotropy causing alignment to become less stable and thus lead to disorder in magnetic moments.

The extreme of this is superparamagnetism which only occurs in small ferromagnetic particles. In this phenomenon, fluctuations are very influential causing magnetic moments to change direction randomly and thus create disorder.

The Curie temperature of nanoparticles is also affected by the crystal lattice structure: body-centred cubic (bcc), face-centred cubic (fcc), and a hexagonal structure (hcp) all have different Curie temperatures due to magnetic moments reacting to their neighbouring electron spins. fcc and hcp have tighter structures and as a results have higher Curie temperatures than bcc as the magnetic moments have stronger effects when closer together. This is known as the coordination number which is the number of nearest neighbouring particles in a structure. This indicates a lower coordination number at the surface of a material than the bulk which leads to the surface becoming less significant when the temperature is approaching the Curie temperature. In smaller systems the coordination number for the surface is more significant and the magnetic moments have a stronger effect on the system.

Although fluctuations in particles can be minuscule, they are heavily dependent on the structure of crystal lattices as they react with their nearest neighbouring particles. Fluctuations are also affected by the exchange interaction as parallel facing magnetic moments are favoured and therefore have less disturbance and disorder, therefore a tighter structure influences a stronger magnetism and therefore a higher Curie temperature.

==== Pressure ====

Pressure changes a material&#x27;s Curie temperature. Increasing pressure on the crystal lattice decreases the volume of the system. Pressure directly affects the kinetic energy in particles as movement increases causing the vibrations to disrupt the order of magnetic moments. This is similar to temperature as it also increases the kinetic energy of particles and destroys the order of magnetic moments and magnetism.

Pressure also affects the density of states (DOS). Here the DOS decreases causing the number of electrons available to the system to decrease. This leads to the number of magnetic moments decreasing as they depend on electron spins. It would be expected because of this that the Curie temperature would decrease; however, it increases. This is the result of the exchange interaction. The exchange interaction favours the aligned parallel magnetic moments due to electrons being unable to occupy the same space in time and as this is increased due to the volume decreasing the Curie temperature increases with pressure. The Curie temperature is made up of a combination of dependencies on kinetic energy and the DOS.

The concentration of particles also affects the Curie temperature when pressure is being applied and can result in a decrease in Curie temperature when the concentration is above a certain percent.

==== Orbital ordering ====

Orbital ordering changes the Curie temperature of a material. Orbital ordering can be controlled through applied strains. This is a function that determines the wave of a single electron or paired electrons inside the material. Having control over the probability of where the electron will be allows the Curie temperature to be altered. For example, the delocalised electrons can be moved onto the same plane by applied strains within the crystal lattice.

The Curie temperature is seen to increase greatly due to electrons being packed together in the same plane, they are forced to align due to the exchange interaction and thus increases the strength of the magnetic moments which prevents thermal disorder at lower temperatures.

== Curie temperature in ferroelectric materials ==

In analogy to ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials, the term Curie temperature () is also applied to the temperature at which a ferroelectric material transitions to being paraelectric. Hence, is the temperature where ferroelectric materials lose their spontaneous polarisation as a first or second order phase change occurs. In case of a second order transition, the Curie Weiss temperature which defines the maximum of the dielectric constant is equal to the Curie temperature. However, the Curie temperature can be 10 K higher than in case of a first order transition.

=== Ferroelectric and dielectric ===

Materials are only ferroelectric below their corresponding transition temperature . Ferroelectric materials are all pyroelectric and therefore have a spontaneous electric polarisation as the structures are unsymmetrical.

Ferroelectric materials&#x27; polarization is subject to hysteresis (Figure 4); that is they are dependent on their past state as well as their current state. As an electric field is applied the dipoles are forced to align and polarisation is created, when the electric field is removed polarisation remains. The hysteresis loop depends on temperature and as a result as the temperature is increased and reaches the two curves become one curve as shown in the dielectric polarisation (Figure 5).

=== Relative permittivity ===

A modified version of the Curie–Weiss law applies to the dielectric constant, also known as the relative permittivity:

formula_8

==Applications==
A heat-induced ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition is used in magneto-optical storage media for erasing and writing of new data. Famous examples include the Sony Minidisc format as well as the now-obsolete CD-MO format. Curie point electro-magnets have been proposed and tested for actuation mechanisms in passive safety systems of fast breeder reactors, where control rods are dropped into the reactor core if the actuation mechanism heats up beyond the material&#x27;s Curie point. Other uses include temperature control in soldering irons and stabilizing the magnetic field of tachometer generators against temperature variation.

<doc id="165385" wikidata="Q2324782" url="?curid=165385" title="She Stoops to Conquer">
<text>She Stoops to Conquer is a comedy by Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith, first performed in London in 1773. The play is a favourite for study by English literature and theatre classes in the English-speaking world. It is one of the few plays from the 18th century to have retained its appeal and is still regularly performed. The play has been adapted into a film several times, including in 1914 and 1923.
Initially the play was titled &quot;Mistakes of a Night&quot; and the events within the play take place in one long night. In 1778, John O&#x27;Keeffe wrote a loose sequel, &quot;Tony Lumpkin in Town&quot;.

The play is notable for being the origin of the common English phrase, &quot;Ask me no questions and I&#x27;ll tell you no lies.&quot; (appearing as &#x27;fibs&#x27; in the play).

==Plot==
===Act I===
Act I begins at the Hardcastles’ home in the countryside. Mrs. Hardcastle complains to her husband that they never leave their rural home to see the new things happening in the city. Hardcastle says he loves everything old, including his old wife. Mrs. Hardcastle says she was a young woman when she had her first husband’s son, Tony, and he is not yet twenty-one; Hardcastle complains about Tony’s immaturity and love of pranks. Tony enters on his way to a pub, and his mother follows him offstage, begging him to stay and spend time with them.

Hardcastle’s daughter Kate enters. He remarks on her fashionable clothing, which he dislikes. Kate reminds him of their deal: she wears what she likes in the morning and dresses in the old-fashioned style he prefers at night. Hardcastle then reveals big news: his friend Sir Charles’s son, Marlow, is coming to visit, and Hardcastle hopes Kate and Marlow will marry. Hardcastle says Marlow has a reputation for being handsome, intelligent and very modest. Kate likes all but the last part of this description and resolves to try to make a good impression on Marlow.

Hardcastle exits, leaving Kate to think over her visitor. She is joined by her cousin Constance, whom she tells about Marlow’s impending visit. Constance tells her that she knows Marlow: he is the best friend of her suitor, Hastings. The odd thing about Marlow is that he is terribly shy around upper-class women, and therefore often seduces lower-class women instead. Mrs. Hardcastle wants Constance to marry her cousin, Tony, so that Constance’s inherited jewels stay in the family. Constance tells Kate that she pretends to be willing to marry Tony so that Mrs. Hardcastle won’t suspect she loves Hastings. Luckily for Constance, Tony doesn’t want to marry Constance any more than she wants to marry him.

The scene changes to a bar, where Tony is drinking with a group of lower-class men. The bar’s owner says that two fashionable-looking men have arrived who say they are looking for Mr. Hardcastle’s house. Tony realizes that this must be Marlow and decides to trick Marlow into believing that Hardcastle’s house is an inn.

===Act II===
Act II begins with Hardcastle trying to teach his servants how to behave in front of his guests. Soon after, Marlow and Hastings arrive at what they believe to be an inn. Hardcastle enters and tries to engage his guests in conversation, but the two young men ignore what he says, believing him to be a lowly innkeeper. Hardcastle is shocked by their rude, presumptuous treatment of him.

Marlow insists on being shown his room, so Hardcastle accompanies him. When Hastings is left alone, Constance enters. Upon hearing that Hastings believes he is in an inn, she guesses it is a trick of Tony. Hastings says that they should keep Marlow’s mistake from him, because he will be embarrassed and leave immediately if he learns the truth. Hastings urges Constance to elope with him, but she is reluctant to lose her fortune: the jewels, which she will only inherit if she marries with her aunt’s permission. She promises to run away with him once she has the jewels.

Marlow returns, complaining that Hardcastle will not leave him alone. Hastings tells Marlow that by coincidence, Constance and her cousin Kate are both at this inn. Marlow freezes in anxiety. Kate enters and tries to engage Marlow in conversation, but once Hastings and Constance leave Kate and Marlow alone, Marlow is too nervous to complete his sentences or even look at Kate’s face. He ends the conversation abruptly and rushes off. Before exiting the stage, Kate reflects to herself that if he weren’t so shy, she would be interested in him.

Tony and Constance enter, followed by Hastings and Mrs. Hardcastle. Constance makes a show of flirting with Tony for Mrs. Hardcastle, while he tries to repel her advances. Hastings chats with Mrs. Hardcastle and she points out Constance and Tony, saying that they are betrothed. Tony objects to this loudly. Hastings tells Mrs. Hardcastle that he will try to talk some sense into Tony, and Constance and Mrs. Hardcastle exit. Hastings reveals to Tony that he loves Constance and wants to elope with her. Tony is thrilled and promises to help the couple any way he can.

===Act III===
Act III begins with Hardcastle and Kate comparing their very different impressions of Marlow. He expresses shock at Marlow’s boldness, while she finds him incredibly shy. Kate convinces her father that they should give Marlow another chance to see what his true character is.

Tony presents Hastings with a box containing Constance’s jewels, which he stole from his mother’s drawers. Constance and Mrs. Hardcastle enter, and Hastings exits. Constance tries to convince her aunt to let her try on her jewels, but Mrs. Hardcastle will not relent. Tony suggests that Mrs. Hardcastle tell Constance the jewels are missing, which she does, upsetting Constance deeply. Tony reassures Constance privately, telling her that he gave her jewels to Hastings, who is preparing for their elopement. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hardcastle has discovered the jewels are indeed missing. Tony teases his distressed mother, and the two of them exit.

Kate enters accompanied by her maid Pimple and wearing the old-fashioned dress her father prefers. She has learned about Tony’s prank and laughs at Marlow’s belief that he is in an inn. Pimple says that Marlow mistook Kate for the inn’s barmaid. Kate says she will take advantage of the mistake, which will enable him to talk to her without such shyness. Pimple exits, and Marlow enters. Kate, pretending to be a maid, speaks to Marlow in the accent of a lower-class woman. Marlow finds her beautiful and immediately begins to flirt with her. He tries to kiss her, but Hardcastle walks into the room and sees them. Marlow flees the room, and Hardcastle tells Kate he is determined to throw Marlow out of his house. Kate persuades her father to give her time to prove to him that Marlow is not what he seems.

===Act IV===
Act IV begins with Constance and Hastings planning their elopement. Constance tells Hastings that she has heard Sir Charles will soon be arriving, and Hastings tells Constance that he has entrusted her box of jewels to Marlow to keep them safe. They both exit.

Marlow enters, congratulating himself on thinking to give the box of jewels to the landlady (i.e., Mrs. Hardcastle) to keep it safe. Hastings enters, and Marlow tells him he stashed the jewels securely with the landlady. Hastings conceals his disappointment that Mrs. Hardcastle has the jewels back and leaves.

Hardcastle enters and begins to argue with Marlow, whose servants have gotten drunk. Storming away, Hardcastle says he would never have predicted such rudeness from Sir Charles’s son. Marlow is confused by this remark, but at that moment, Kate enters. Marlow, beginning to understand something is amiss, asks Kate where they are, and she tells him that they are at Mr. Hardcastle’s house. Marlow is horrified at his error. Kate does not yet reveal her true identity, pretending instead to be a poor relation of the family. Marlow announces his departure, and Kate weeps at the news. He is touched to see how much she cares about him.

Tony and Constance discuss her plan to elope with Hastings, even without the jewels. Mrs. Hardcastle enters and the two cousins pretend to flirt so she won’t suspect the planned elopement. A letter comes from Hastings addressed to Tony, but because Tony cannot read, his mother reads it to him. The letter reveals the plan for the elopement. Mrs. Hardcastle is furious and tells Constance she is sending her far away to Aunt Pedigree’s house. Hastings enters and yells at Tony for giving away the secret. Marlow enters and yells at both Tony and Hastings for deceiving him about where he is. Constance is utterly distraught and begs Hastings to stay faithful to her even if they have to wait several years to marry. After Constance leaves, Tony tells Hastings to meet him in the garden in two hours, promising to make it all up to him.

===Act V===
In Act V, Hardcastle and the newly arrived Sir Charles laugh over Marlow’s having mistaken the home for an inn. Hardcastle says that he saw Marlow take Kate’s hand, and he thinks that they will marry. Marlow enters and formally apologizes to Hardcastle. Hardcastle says it doesn’t matter, since Marlow and Kate will soon marry, but Marlow denies having feelings for Kate. When Hardcastle refuses to believe him, Marlow storms out. Kate enters and assures the two fathers that Marlow likes her. She tells the two fathers to hide behind a screen in half an hour to see proof of Marlow’s feelings.

Out in the garden, Tony arrives and tells Hastings that he has driven his mother and Constance in a circle instead of taking them to Aunt Pedigree’s house. Mrs. Hardcastle is terrified, thinking they are lost in dangerous territory. Hastings rushes off to find Constance. Elsewhere in the garden, Hastings tries to convince Constance to elope with him. She says she is too exhausted from the stress of the night to run off. Instead she wants to explain their situation to Hardcastle and hope that he can influence his wife to allow their marriage.

Inside the house, Hardcastle and Sir Charles hide behind a screen and watch Marlow and Kate talk. Kate no longer pretends to be a barmaid, but speaks in her normal voice. Marlow says he wishes he could stay with her, but he does not want to disappoint his family by marrying someone of lower birth. Kate tells him she has the same background as the woman he came to see. Marlow kneels before her, and the two fathers burst out from behind the screen, asking why he lied to them about his feelings for Kate. Marlow learns Kate’s true identity and is embarrassed again at having been so deceived.

Mrs. Hardcastle and Tony enter (Mrs. Hardcastle having realized where she is). Mrs. Hardcastle says that Constance and Hastings have run off together, but she is consoled by the fact that she will get to keep Constance’s jewels. At that moment, however, Hastings and Constance enter. Sir Charles recognizes Hastings and tells Hardcastle that he is a good man. Hardcastle asks Tony if he is really sure that he doesn’t want to marry his cousin. Tony says he is sure, but that it doesn’t matter, since he cannot formally refuse to marry Constance until he is twenty-one. Hardcastle then reveals that Mrs. Hardcastle has been hiding the fact that Tony is in fact already twenty-one. At this, Tony says he will not marry Constance, freeing her to marry Hastings and keep her fortune. Everyone except Mrs. Hardcastle is thrilled that the two young couples – Hastings and Constance, and Marlow and Kate – will marry.
==Productions==
The original production premiered in London at Covent Garden Theatre on 15 March 1773 with Mary Bulkley as Constantia Hardcastle, and was immediately successful. In the nineteenth century, actor and comedian Lionel Brough debuted as Tony Lumpkin in 1869 and continued to play the character in 1777 performances, whilst an 1881 production of the play was socialite and actress Lillie Langtry&#x27;s first big success.

In 1964, the play was staged by the Edinburgh Gateway Company, directed by Victor Carin. It was chosen by the Angles Theatre company to relaunch the Georgian Angles Theatre in 1978, about 130 years after it closed. An incident in a nearby house in Leverington may have been the basis of the play. Goldsmith is supposed to have visited his friends the Lumpkins at their home Parkfield, Leverington. Lumpkin moved to Wisbech later and this play was very popular in the local theatre.

Perhaps one of the most famous modern incarnations of &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; was Peter Hall&#x27;s version, staged in 1993 and starring Miriam Margolyes as Mrs. Hardcastle.{{who says|date=August 2018}} The most famous TV production is the 1971 version featuring Ralph Richardson, Tom Courtenay, Juliet Mills, and Brian Cox, with Trevor Peacock as Tony Lumpkin. Courtenay, Mills, and Peacock also performed in this play at The Garrick Theatre, London, in 1969. The 1971 version was shot on location near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, and is part of the BBC archive. This play was one of 13 BBC productions that formed the series of thirteen British and European plays called Classic Theatre, the Humanities in Drama. The series was funded in the U.S. by the National Endowment for the Humanities and used as a study aid on video tape by thousands of U.S. students.

In 2008 the play was again produced in Wisbech. The story goes that Oliver Goldsmith wrote the play while staying with the Lumpkin family at Park House in Leverington, near Wisbech and that he lampooned his friend, Nicholas Lumpkin, by turning him into his famous creation, Tony Lumpkin. The real Lumpkin moved to Wisbech after his money ran out.

==Type of comedy==
{{original research section|date=August 2018}}

When the play was first produced, it was discussed as an example of the revival of laughing comedy over the sentimental comedy seen as dominant on the English stage since the success of &quot;The Conscious Lovers&quot;, written by Sir Richard Steele in 1722. An essay published in a London magazine in 1773, entitled &quot;An Essay on the Theatre; Or, A Comparison between Laughing And Sentimental Comedy&quot;, argued that sentimental comedy, a false form of comedy, had taken over the boards from the older and more truly comic laughing comedy.

Some theatre historians believe the essay was written by Goldsmith as a puff piece for &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; as an exemplar of the &quot;laughing comedy&quot;. Goldsmith&#x27;s name was linked with that of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, author of &quot;The Rivals&quot; and &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, as standard-bearers for the resurgent laughing comedy.{{cn|date=June 2019}}

The play might also be seen as a comedy of manners in which the comedy arises from the gap between the standards of behaviour the characters regard as proper in polite society, and the more informal behaviours they are prepared to indulge or deploy in settings they deem less constrained by such standards.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Kate&#x27;s stooping and Marlow&#x27;s nervousness are also examples of romantic comedy, as are Constance Neville&#x27;s and George Hastings&#x27; love and plan to elope.{{cn|date=June 2019}}

==Title==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
The title refers to Kate&#x27;s ruse of pretending to be a barmaid to reach her goal. It originates in the poetry of Dryden, which Goldsmith may have seen misquoted by Lord Chesterfield. In Chesterfield&#x27;s version, the lines in question read:
&quot;The prostrate lover, when he lowest lies,
But stoops to conquer, and but kneels to rise.&quot;

==Characters==
*Charles Marlow – The central male character, who has set out to court the young attractive Kate Hardcastle. A well-educated man, &quot;bred a scholar&quot;, Marlow is brash and rude to Mr. Hardcastle, owner of &quot;Liberty Hall&quot; (a reference to another site in London), whom Marlow believes to be an innkeeper. Marlow is sophisticated and has travelled the world. Around working-class women Marlow is a lecherous rogue, but around those of an upper-class card he is a nervous, bumbling fool.
*George Hastings – Friend of Charles Marlow and the admirer of Miss Constance Neville. Hastings is an educated man who cares deeply about Constance, with the intention of fleeing to France with her.
*Tony Lumpkin – Son of Mrs Hardcastle and stepson to Mr Hardcastle, Tony is a mischievous, uneducated playboy.
*Mr. Hardcastle – The father of Kate Hardcastle but he is mistaken by Marlow and Hastings as an innkeeper.
*Mrs. Hardcastle – Wife to Mr. Hardcastle and mother to Tony, Mrs. Hardcastle is a corrupt and eccentric character. She is an over-protective mother to Tony, whom she loves, but fails to tell him he&#x27;s of age so that he is eligible to receive £1,500 a year.
*Miss Kate Hardcastle – Daughter to Mr. Hardcastle, and the play&#x27;s stooping-to-conquer heroine.
*Miss Constance Neville – Niece of Mrs. Hardcastle, she is the woman whom Hastings intends to court.
*Sir Charles Marlow – An aristocratic gentleman and father of Charles Marlow; he follows his son, a few hours behind.

==Reception==
Goldsmith&#x27;s friend and contemporary Samuel Johnson greatly admired the play. James Boswell quoted him as saying, &quot;I know of no comedy for many years that has so much exhilarated an audience that it has answered so much the great end of comedy – making an audience merry&quot;.

<doc id="165390" wikidata="Q10389631" url="?curid=165390" title="Venality">
<text>Venality is a vice associated with being bribeable or willing to sell one&#x27;s services or power, especially when people are intended to act in a decent way instead. In its most recognizable form, venality causes people to lie and steal for their own personal advantage, and is related to bribery and nepotism, among other vices.
Though not in line with dictionary definitions of the term, modern writers often use it to connote vices only tangentially related to bribery or self-interest, such as cruelty, selfishness, and general dishonesty.

== Context ==
Venality in its mild form is a vice notable especially among those with government or military careers. For example, the Ancien Régime in France from the 1500s through the late 1700s, was notorious for the venality of many government officials. In these fields, one is ideally supposed to act with justice and honor and not accept bribes. That ensures that the organization is not susceptible to manipulation by self-interested parties.

In contrast to the previous interpretation, dishonesty is not specifically expressed in the literal meaning, but is often implied. The condition of failing to act justly is not a literal component of the word&#x27;s meaning either. By definition, committing &quot;venal&quot; acts does not indicate &quot;stealing&quot; or &quot;lying&quot;, but rather suggests a consensual arrangement, perhaps without conscience or regard for consequences, but is not synonymous with stealing. While bribery could be related, nepotism clearly has no literal similarity or correlation with venality. Though venality is generally used as a pejorative term, an individual or entity could be venal (or mercenary) and not be corrupt or unethical. One could perform one&#x27;s duties or job in a perfunctory manner in order to collect a wage or payment, or prostitute one&#x27;s time or skills for monetary or material gain, without necessarily being dishonest.

Much contemporary use of the words venal or venality is applied to modern professional athletes, particularly baseball, basketball, American football, and soccer players all around the world. The implication being that the highly paid players are essentially &quot;hired guns&quot; with no allegiance to any team or city, and are motivated solely by the acquisition of material wealth.

== In revolution and other moral panics ==

For people to accept settlements and legislation, the acts of the government must be seen as just. This perception enhances the legitimacy of the government. Venality is a term often used with reference to pre-revolutionary France, where it describes the then-widespread practice of selling administrative positions within the government to the highest bidder, especially regarding the Nobles of the Robe.

Thus, for example, venality was a charge for which, in part, Danton and others were executed during the Reign of Terror.

<doc id="165391" wikidata="Q1816573" url="?curid=165391" title="Antisemitism in Islam">
<text>There is considerable debate about the nature of antisemitism in Islam, including Muslim attitudes towards Jews, Islamic teachings on Jews and Judaism, and the treatment of Jews in Islamic societies throughout the history of Islam. Islamic literary sources have described Jewish groups in negative terms and have also called for acceptance of them. Some of these descriptions overlap with Islamic remarks on non-Muslim religious groups in general. 

With the rise of Islam in Arabia in the 7th century CE and its subsequent spread during the early Muslim conquests, Jews, alongside many other peoples, became subject to the rule of Islamic polities. Their quality of life under Muslim rule varied considerably in different periods, as did the attitudes of the rulers, government officials, the clergy, and the general population towards Jews, ranging from tolerance to persecution.

An antisemitic trope found in some Islamic discourse is the accusation of Jews as the &quot;killers of prophets&quot;. This accusation is often interpreted as a condemnation of the entire Jewish people, believed by many to be an eternal charge.

==Range of opinions==
*Claude Cahen and Shelomo Dov Goitein argue against the claim that antisemitism has a long history in Muslim countries, writing that the discrimination that was practiced against non-Muslims (&quot;Kuffar&quot;) was of a general nature, so it was not specifically directed against Jews. According to these scholars, antisemitism in medieval Islam was local and sporadic rather than general and endemic.
*Bernard Lewis writes that while Muslims have held negative stereotypes regarding Jews throughout most of Islamic history, these stereotypes were different from those stereotypes which accompanied European antisemitism because, unlike Christians who considered Jews objects of fear, Muslims only considered Jews objects of ridicule. He argues that Muslims did not attribute &quot;cosmic evil&quot; to Jews. In Lewis&#x27; view, it was only in the late 19th century that movements first appeared among Muslims that can be described as antisemitic in the European forms.
*Frederick M. Schweitzer and Marvin Perry state that there are mostly negative references to Jews in the Quran and Hadith, and that &quot;Islamic&quot; regimes treated Jews in degrading ways. They assert that both the Jews and the Christians were relegated to the status of &quot;dhimmi&quot;. Schweitzer and Perry state that throughout much of history, Christians treated Jews worse than Muslims did, stating that Jews in Christian lands were subjected to worse polemics, persecutions, and massacres than Jews who lived under Muslim rule.
*According to Walter Laqueur, the varying interpretations of the Quran are important for understanding Muslim attitudes towards Jews. Many Quranic verses preach tolerance towards the Jews; others make hostile remarks about them (which are similar to hostile remarks against all who do not accept Islam). Muhammad interacted with the Jewish tribes of Arabia: he preached to convert them, fought and killed many, but also befriended other Jews.
* For Martin Kramer, the idea that contemporary antisemitism by Muslims is authentically Islamic &quot;touches on some truths, yet it misses many others&quot; (see antisemitism in the Arab world). Kramer believes that contemporary antisemitism is only partially due to the policies of the State of Israel, which Muslims consider an injustice and a major cause of their sense of victimhood and loss. Kramer attributes the primary causes of Muslim antisemitism to modern European antisemitic ideologies which have infected the Muslim world.
*Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, a Lebanese writer and political analyst, devoted a chapter of her book &quot;Hizbu&#x27;llah: Politics and Religion&quot; to an analysis of Hezbollah&#x27;s anti-Jewish beliefs. She argues that although Zionism has influenced Hezbollah&#x27;s anti-Judaism, &quot;it is not contingent upon it&quot; because Hezbollah&#x27;s hatred of Jews is more religiously motivated than politically motivated.

==Jews in the Quran==
===No mention of Jews during the Meccan period===
Jews are not mentioned at all in verses dating from the Meccan period. According to Bernard Lewis, the attention given to Jews is relatively insignificant.

===Terms referring to Jews===
====Bani Israil====
The Quran makes 44 specific references to the &quot;Banū Isrāʾīl&quot; (the Children of Israel). although the term might refer to both Jews and Christians as a single religious lineage. In the Quran (2:140), Jews (&quot;Yahūdi&quot;) are considered a religious group, while &quot;Banū Isrāʾīl&quot; are an ethnic group.

====Yahud and Yahudi====
The Arabic term &quot;Yahūd&quot; and &quot;Yahūdi&quot; (Jew, Jews), occur 11 times, and the verb &quot;hāda&quot; (meaning &quot;to be a Jew/Jewish&quot;) occurs 10 times. According to Khalid Durán, the negative passages use &quot;Yahūd&quot;, while the positive references speak mainly of the &quot;Banū Isrāʾīl&quot;.

===Negative references to Jews===
The references in the Quran to Jews are interpreted in different ways. According to Frederick M. Schweitzer and Marvin Perry, these references are &quot;mostly negative&quot;. According to Tahir Abbas, the general references to Jews are favorable, with only those addressed to particular groups of Jews containing harsh criticism.

===Adoption of Jewish practices===
According to Bernard Lewis and some other scholars, the earliest verses of the Quran were largely sympathetic to Jews. Muhammad admired them as monotheists and saw them as natural adherents to the new faith, and Jewish practices helped model early Islamic behavior, such as midday prayer, Friday prayer, Ramadan fasting (considered to be modeled after Yom Kippur), and most famously the fact that until 623 CE Muslims prayed toward Jerusalem, not Mecca.

===Constitution of Medina===
After his flight (&quot;al-hijra&quot;) from Mecca in 622 CE, Muhammad with his followers settled in Yathrib, subsequently renamed &quot;Medina al-Nabi&quot; (&#x27;City of the Prophet&#x27;) where he drew up a &#x27;social contract&#x27;, the Constitution of Medina. This contract, known as &quot;the Leaf&quot; (&quot;ṣaḥīfa&quot;) upheld the peaceful coexistence between Muslims, Jews, and Christians, defining them all, under certain conditions, as constituting the &quot;Ummah&quot; or &quot;community&quot; of that city, and granting freedom of religious thought and practice to all. Alongside the 200-odd emigrants from Mecca (&quot;Muhājirūn&quot;) who had followed Muhammad, the population of Yathrib/Medina consisted of the Faithful of Medina (&quot;Anṣār&quot;, &quot;the Helpers&quot;), Arab Pagans, three Jewish tribes, and some Christians.

The foundational constitution sought to establish, for the first time in history according to Ali Khan, a formal agreement securing interfaith coexistence, with articles requiring mutual support in the defense of the city:

The three local Jewish tribes were the Banu Nadir, the Banu Qurayza, and the Banu Qaynuqa. According to Rodinson, Muhammad had no prejudice against them, and appears to have regarded his own message as substantially the same as that received by Jews on Sinai. But Reuven Firestone claims that tribal politics, and Muhammad&#x27;s deep frustration at Jewish refusals to accept his prophethood, quickly led to a break with all three.

====Hostility between Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa====
The Banu Qaynuqa were expelled from Medina in 624 CE. In March 624 CE, Muslims led by Muhammad defeated the Meccans of the Banu Quraysh tribe in the Battle of Badr. Ibn Ishaq writes that a dispute broke out between the Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa (the allies of the Khazraj tribe) soon afterwards. When a Muslim woman visited a jeweler&#x27;s shop in the Qaynuqa marketplace, she was pestered to uncover her hair. The goldsmith, a Jew, pinned her clothing such that, upon getting up, she was stripped naked. A Muslim man coming upon the resulting commotion killed the shopkeeper in retaliation. A mob of Jews from the Qaynuqa tribe then pounced on the Muslim man and killed him. This escalated to a chain of revenge killings, and enmity grew between Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa.

Traditional Islamic sources view these episodes as a violation of the Constitution of Medina. Muhammad himself regarded this as &quot;casus belli&quot;. However, Western scholars and historians do not find in these events the underlying reason for Muhammad&#x27;s attack on the Qaynuqa. Fred Donner argues that Muhammad turned against the Banu Qaynuqa because as artisans and traders, the latter were in close contact with Meccan merchants. Weinsinck views the episodes cited by the Muslim historians used to justify their expulsion, such as a Jewish goldsmith humiliating a Muslim woman, as having no more than anecdotal value. He writes that the Jews had assumed a contentious attitude towards Muhammad, and as a group possessing substantial independent power, they posed a great danger. Wensinck thus concludes that Muhammad, strengthened by the victory at the Battle of Badr, soon resolved to eliminate the Jewish opposition to himself. Norman Stillman also believes that Muhammad decided to move against the Jews of Medina after being strengthened in the wake of the Battle of Badr.

Muhammad then approached the Banu Qaynuqa, gathering them in the market place and warned them to stop their hostility lest they suffer the same fate that happened to the Quraish at Badr. He also told them to accept Islam saying he was a prophet sent by God as per their scriptures. The tribe responded by mocking Muhammad&#x27;s followers for accepting him as a prophet and also mocked their victory at Badr saying the Quraish had no knowledge of war. They then warned him that if he ever fought with them, he will know that they were real men. This response was viewed as a declaration of war. Muhammad then besieged the Banu Qaynuqa after which the tribe surrendered unconditionally and were later expelled from Medina.

In 625 CE, the Banu Nadir tribe was evicted from Medina after they attempted to assassinate Muhammad. In 627 CE, when the Quraysh and their allies besieged the city in the Battle of the Trench, the Qurayza initially tried to remain neutral but eventually entered into negotiations with the besieging army, violating the pact they had agreed to years earlier. Subsequently, the tribe was charged with treason and besieged by the Muslims commanded by Muhammad. The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered and their men were beheaded. The spoils of battle, including the enslaved women and children of the tribe, were divided up among the companions that had participated in the siege and among the emigrees from Mecca who had hitherto depended on the help of the Muslims native to Medina. Although the Banu Qurayza never took up arms against Muhammad or the Muslims, they entered into negotiations with the invading army and violated the Constitution of Medina. However, Nuam ibn Masud was able to sow discord between the invading forces and Banu Qurayza, thus breaking down the negotiations.

====Verses in the Quran====
As a result, the direction of Muslim prayer was shifted towards Mecca from Jerusalem. According to Laqueur, conflicting statements about Jews in the Quran have affected Muslim attitudes towards Jews to this day, especially during periods of rising Islamic fundamentalism.

===Judaism in Islamic theology===
According to Bernard Lewis, there is nothing in Islamic theology, with one single exception, that can be considered refutations of Judaism or ferocious anti-Jewish diatribes. Lewis and Chanes suggest that, for a variety of reasons, Muslims were not antisemitic for the most part. The Quran, like Judaism, orders Muslims to profess strict monotheism. It also rejects the stories of Jewish deicide as a blasphemous absurdity, and other similar stories in the Gospels play no part in the Muslim educational system. The Quran does not present itself as a fulfillment of the Hebrew Bible but rather a restoration of its original message (see Tahrif for such claimed alterations and Tawrat for the Islamic understanding of the Torah as an Islamic holy book). In such a line of argument, no clash of interpretations between Judaism and Islam can arise.

In addition, Lewis argues that the Quran lacks popular Western traditions of &#x27;guilt and betrayal&#x27;. Rosenblatt and Pinson suggest that the Quran teaches toleration of Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith.

Lewis adds that negative attributes ascribed to subject religions (in this case Judaism and Christianity) are usually expressed in religious and social terms, but only very rarely in ethnic or racial terms. However, this does sometimes occur. The language of abuse is often quite strong. Lewis adduces that three Quranic verses (, , ) ground conventional Muslim epithets for Jews (as apes) and Christians (as pigs). The interpretation of these &#x27;enigmatic&#x27; passages in Islamic exegetics is highly complex, dealing as they do with infractions like breaking the Sabbath. According to Goitein, the idea of Jewish Sabbath breakers turning into apes may reflect the influence of Yemeni midrashim. Firestone notes that the Qurayza tribe itself is described in Muslim sources as using the trope of being turned into apes if one breaks the Sabbath to justify not exploiting the Sabbath in order to attack Mohammad, when they were under siege.

According to Stillman, the Quran praises Moses, and depicts the Israelites as the recipients of divine favour. The Quran dedicates many verses to the glorification of Hebrew prophets, says Leon Poliakov. He quotes verse as an example,
And We blessed him with Isaac and Jacob. We guided them all as We previously guided Noah and those among his descendants: David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. This is how We reward the good-doers. Likewise, ˹We guided˺ Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias, who were all of the righteous. ˹We also guided˺ Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot, favouring each over other people ˹of their time˺.

===Islamic remarks about Jews===
Leon Poliakov, Walter Laqueur, and Jane Gerber, argue that passages in the Quran reproach Jews for their refusal to recognize Muhammad as a prophet of God. &quot;The Quran is engaged mainly in dealing with the sinners among the Jews and the attack on them is shaped according to models that one encounters in the New Testament.&quot; The Muslim holy text defined the Arab and Muslim attitude towards Jews to this day, especially in the periods when Islamic fundamentalism was on the rise.

Walter Laqueur states that the Quran and its interpreters have a great many conflicting things to say about the Jews. Jews are said to be treacherous and hypocritical and could never be friends with a Muslim.

Frederick M. Schweitzer and Marvin Perry state that references to Jews in the Quran are mostly negative. The Quran states that wretchedness and baseness were stamped upon the Jews, and they were visited with wrath from Allah, that was because they disbelieved in Allah&#x27;s revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully. And for their taking usury, which was prohibited for them, and because of their consuming people&#x27;s wealth under false pretense, a painful punishment was prepared for them. The Quran requires their &quot;abasement and poverty&quot; in the form of the poll tax jizya. In his &quot;wrath&quot; God has &quot;cursed&quot; the Jews and will turn them into apes/monkeys and swine and idol worshipers because they are &quot;infidels&quot;.

According to Martin Kramer, the Quran speaks of Jews in a negative way and reports instances of Jewish treachery against the Islamic prophet Muhammad. However, Islam did not hold up those Jews who practiced treachery against Muhammad as archetypes nor did it portray treachery as the embodiment of Jews in all times and places. The Quran also attests to Muhammad&#x27;s amicable relations with Jews.

While traditional religious supremacism played a role in the Islamic view of Jews, the same attitude applied to Christians and other non-Muslims. Islamic tradition regards Jews as a legitimate community of believers in God (called &quot;people of the Book&quot;) legally entitled to sufferance.

The standard Quranic reference to Jews is the verse . It says:

However, due to the Quran&#x27;s timely process of story-telling, some scholars argue that all references to Jews or other groups within the Quran refers to only certain populations at a certain point in history. Also, the Quran praises some Jews in :
&quot;Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians and Christians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.&quot;

The Quran gives credence to the Christian claim of Jews scheming against Jesus, &quot; ... but God also schemed, and God is the best of schemers.&quot; () In the mainstream Muslim view, the crucifixion of Jesus was an illusion, and thus the Jewish plots against him ended in failure. According to Gerber, in numerous verses (; ; ; ; , , ; ) the Quran accuses Jews of altering the Scripture. According to Gabriel Said Reynolds, &quot;the Qur’ān makes &#x27;the killing of the prophets&#x27; one of the principal characteristics of the Jews&quot;; although the Quran emphasizes the killing of the Jewish prophets by the Israelites, Reynolds remarks that none of them were killed by the Israelites according to the Biblical account.

But the Quran differentiates between &quot;good and bad&quot; Jews, adding to the idea that the Jewish people or their religion itself are not the target of the story-telling process. Rubin claims the criticisms deal mainly &quot;with the sinners among the Jews and the attack on them is shaped according to models that one encounters in the New Testament.&quot; The Quran also speaks favorably of Jews. Though it also criticizes them for not being grateful for God&#x27;s blessing on them, the harsh criticisms are only addressed towards a particular group of Jews, which is clear from the context of the Quranic verses, but translations usually confuse this by using the general term &quot;Jews&quot;. To judge Jews based on the deeds of some of their ancestors is an anti-Quranic idea.

Ali S. Asani suggests that the Quran endorses the establishment of religiously and culturally plural societies and this endorsement has affected the treatment of religious minorities in Muslim lands throughout history. He cites the endorsement of pluralism to explain why violent forms of antisemitism generated in medieval and modern Europe, culminating in the Holocaust, never occurred in regions under Muslim rule.

Some verses of the Quran, notably , preach tolerance towards members of the Jewish faith. According to Kramer, Jews are regarded as members of a legitimate community of believers in God, &quot;people of the Book&quot;, and therefore legally entitled to sufferance.

As one of the five pillars of Islam Muslims perform daily Salat prayers, which involves reciting the first chapter of the Qur&#x27;an, the Al-Fatiha. Most commentators suggest that the description, &quot;those who earn Thine anger&quot; in refers to the Jews. Israel Shrenzel, former chief analyst in the Arabic section of the research division of the Shin Bet and a current teacher in Tel Aviv University’s department of Arabic and Islamic studies wrote, &quot;Given that there is contradiction between the content and message of the two groups of verses – those hostile to Jews and those tolerant toward them – the question is which group is to be adopted nowadays by the Muslim scholars and masses. The more dominant view adheres to the first group&quot;.

In 567, Khaybar was invaded and vacated of its Jewish inhabitants by the Ghassanid Arab Christian king Al-Harith ibn Jabalah. He later freed to the captives upon his return to the Levant. A brief account of the campaign is given by Ibn Qutaybah, and potentially also mentioned in the sixth-century Harran inscription. See Irfan Shahid&#x27;s &quot;Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century&quot; for full details.

In the 7th century, Khaybar was inhabited by Jews, who pioneered the cultivation of the oasis and made their living growing date palm trees, as well as through commerce and craftsmanship, accumulating considerable wealth. Some objects found by the Muslims when they entered Khaybar — a siege-engine, 20 bales of Yemenite cloth, and 500 cloaks — point out to an intense trade carried out by the Jews. In the past some scholars attempted to explain the siege-engine by suggesting that it was used for settling quarrels among the families of the community. Today most academics believe it was stored in a depôt for future sale, in the same way that swords, lances, shields, and other weaponry had been sold by the Jews to Arabs. Equally, the cloth and the cloaks may have been intended for sale, as it was unlikely that such a quantity of luxury goods were kept for the exclusive use of the Jews.

The oasis was divided into three regions: al-Natat, al-Shikk, and al-Katiba, probably separated by natural divisions, such as the desert, lava drifts, and swamps. Each of these regions contained several fortresses or redoubts containing homes, storehouses and stables. Each fortress was occupied by a separate family and surrounded by cultivated fields and palm-groves. In order to improve their defensive capabilities, the settlers raised the fortresses up on hills or basalt rocks.

Jews continued to live in the oasis for several more years afterwards until they were finally expelled by caliph Umar. The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews of the Khaybar Fortress served as a precedent. Islamic law came to require exaction of tribute known as &quot;jizya&quot; from &quot;dhimmis&quot;, i.e. non-Muslims under Muslim rule.

For many centuries, the oasis at Khaybar was an important caravan stopping place. The center developed around a series of ancient dams built to hold run-off water from the rain. Around the water catchments, date palms grew. Khaybar became an important date-producing center.

The words &quot;humility&quot; and &quot;humiliation&quot; occur frequently in the Quran and later Muslim literature in relation to Jews. According to Lewis, &quot;This, in Islamic view, is their just punishment for their past rebelliousness, and is manifested in their present impotence between the mighty powers of Christendom and Islam.&quot; The standard Quranic reference to Jews is verse : &quot;And remember ye said: &quot;O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.&quot; He said: &quot;Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!&quot; They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing.&quot;

Two verses later we read: &quot;And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from you and raised the mountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become mindful ˹of Allah˺.” Yet you turned away afterwards. Had it not been for Allah&#x27;s grace and mercy upon you, you would have certainly been of the losers. You are already aware of those of you who broke the Sabbath. We said to them, “Be disgraced apes!” So We made their fate an example to present and future generations, and a lesson to the God-fearing.&quot;

The Quran associates Jews with rejection of God&#x27;s prophets including Jesus and Muhammad, thus explaining their resistance to him personally. (Cf. Surah ; , 61, 70, and 82.) It also asserts that Jews and Christians claim to be children of God (Surah ), and that only they will achieve salvation (Surah ). According to the Quran, Jews blasphemously claim that Ezra is the son of God, as Christians claim Jesus is, (Surah ) and that God&#x27;s hand is fettered (Surah – i.e., that they can freely defy God). Some of those who are Jews, &quot;pervert words from their meanings&quot;, (Surah ), and because they have committed wrongdoing, God has &quot;forbidden some good things that were previously permitted them&quot;, thus explaining Jewish commandments regarding food, Sabbath restrictions on work, and other rulings as a punishment from God (Surah ). They listen for the sake of mendacity (Surah ), twisting the truth, and practice forbidden usury, and therefore they will receive &quot;a painful doom&quot; (Surah ). The Quran gives credence to the Christian claim of Jews scheming against Jesus, &quot;... but God also schemed, and God is the best of schemers&quot;(Surah ). In the Muslim view, the crucifixion of Jesus was an illusion, and thus the supposed Jewish plots against him ended in complete failure. In numerous verses (Surah , ; , ; , , ; ) the Quran accuses Jews of deliberately obscuring and perverting scripture.

===Influence of Western antisemitism===
Martin Kramer argues that &quot;Islamic tradition did not hold up those Jews who practiced treachery against Muhammad as archetypes—as the embodiment of Jews in all times and places.&quot; Thus for Muslims to embrace the belief that the Jews are the eternal &quot;enemies of God&quot;, there must be more at work than the Islamic tradition. Islamic tradition does, however, provide the sources for Islamic antisemitism and &quot;there is no doubt whatsoever that the Islamic tradition provides sources on which Islamic antisemitism now feeds.&quot; The modern use of the Quran to support antisemitism is, however, selective and distorting. The fact that many Islamic thinkers have spent time in the West has resulted in the absorption of antisemitism, he says. Specifically, Kramer believes that the twin concepts of the &quot;eternal Jew&quot; as the enemy of God and the &quot;arch conspirator&quot; are themes that are borrowed &quot;from the canon of Western religious and racial antisemitism.&quot; In his view, Islamic antisemitism is &quot;[l]Like other antisemitism&quot; in that &quot;it has its origins in the anti-rational ideologies of modern Europe, which have now infected the Islamic world.&quot;

==Muhammad and Jews==

During Muhammad&#x27;s life, Jews lived on the Arabian Peninsula, especially in and around Medina. Muhammad is known to have had a Jewish wife, Safiyya bint Huyayy, who subsequently converted to Islam. Safiyya, who was previously the wife of Kenana ibn al-Rabi, was selected by Muhammad as his bride after the Battle of Khaybar.

According to Islamic sources, the Medinian Jews began to develop friendly alliances with Muhammad&#x27;s enemies in Mecca so they could overthrow him, despite the fact that they promised not to overthrow him in the treaty of the Constitution of Medina and promised to take the side of him and his followers and fight against their enemies. Two Jewish tribes were expelled and the third one was wiped out. The Banu Qaynuqa was expelled for their hostility against the Muslims and for mocking them. The Banu Nadir was expelled after they attempted to assassinate Muhammad. The last one, the Banu Qurayza, was wiped out after the Battle of Trench where they attempted to ally themselves with the invading Quraish.

Samuel Rosenblatt opines these incidents were not part of policies directed exclusively against Jews, and Muhammad was more severe with his pagan Arab kinsmen. In addition, Muhammad&#x27;s conflict with Jews was considered of rather minor importance. According to Lewis, since the clash of Judaism and Islam was resolved and ended with the victory of the Muslims during Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime, no unresolved theological dispute among Muslims fueled antisemitism. There is also a difference between the Jewish denial of the Christian message and the Jewish denial of the Muslim message, because Muhammad never claimed to be the Messiah nor did he claim to be the Son of God, however, he is referred to as &quot;the Apostle of God.&quot; The cause of Muhammad&#x27;s death is disputable, though the Hadiths tend to suggest he may have eventually succumbed to being poisoned at Khaybar by one of the surviving Jewish widows.

According to Rosenblatt, Muhammad&#x27;s disputes with the neighboring Jewish tribes left no marked traces on his immediate successors (known as Caliphs). The first Caliphs generally based their treatment of Jews upon the Quranic verses which encourage tolerance of them. Classical commentators viewed Muhammad&#x27;s struggle with the Jews as a minor episode in his career, but the interpretation of it has shifted in modern times.

===Hadith===
The hadith (non-Quranic accounts of Muhammad) use both &quot;Banu Israil&quot; and &quot;Yahud&quot; as terms for Jews, the latter term becoming ever more frequent and appearing mostly in negative context. For example, Jews were &quot;cursed and changed into rats&quot; in (see also ).

According to Norman Stillman:

 Jews in Medina are singled out as &quot;men whose malice and enmity was aimed at the Apostle of God&quot;. The Yahūd in this literature appear not only as malicious, but also deceitful, cowardly and totally lacking resolve. However, they have none of the demonic qualities attributed to them in mediaeval Christian literature, neither is there anything comparable to the overwhelming preoccupation with Jews and Judaism (except perhaps in the narratives on Muhammad&#x27;s encounters with Medinan Jewry) in Muslim traditional literature. Except for a few notable exceptions ... the Jews in the Sira and the Maghazi are even heroic villains. Their ignominy stands in marked contrast to Muslim heroism, and in general, conforms to the Quranic image of &quot;wretchedness and baseness stamped upon them&quot;

According to Schweitzer and Perry, the hadith are &quot;even more scathing (than the Quran) in attacking the Jews&quot;:They are debased, cursed, anathematized forever by God and so can never repent and be forgiven; they are cheats and traitors; defiant and stubborn; they killed the prophets; they are liars who falsify scripture and take bribes; as infidels they are ritually unclean, a foul odor emanating from them – such is the image of the Jew in classical Islam, degraded and malevolent.

==== Gharqad tree hadith ====

Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari record various recensions of a hadith where Muhammad had prophesied that the Day of Judgment will not come until Muslims and Jews fight each other. The Muslims will kill the Jews with such success that they will then hide behind stones or both trees and stones according to various recensions, which will then cry out to a Muslim that a Jew is hiding behind them and ask them to kill him. The only one not to do so will be the Gharqad tree as it is the tree of the Jews. The following hadith which forms a part of these Sahih Muslim hadiths has been quoted many times, and it became a part of the Hamas militant organization&#x27;s original 1988 charter:
Different interpretations about the Gharqad tree mentioned in the Hadith exists. One of the interpretations is that the Gharqad tree is an actual tree. Israelis have been alleged to plant the tree around various locations for e.g., their settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, around the Israel Museum and the Knesset. Other claims about the tree are that it grows outside Jerusalem&#x27;s Herod&#x27;s Gate or that it is actually a bush that grows outside Jaffa Gate which some Muslims believe is where Jesus will return to Earth and slay the Dajjal, following the final battle between the Muslims and unbelievers which some believe will take place directly below the Jaffa Gate and the Sultan&#x27;s Pool. Another interpretation that exists is that the mention of the Gharqad tree is symbolic and is in reference to all the forces of the world believed to conspire with the Jews against Muslims.

==Pre-modern Islam==
Jerome Chanes, Pinson, Rosenblatt, Mark R. Cohen, Norman Stillman, Uri Avnery, M. Klien, and Bernard Lewis all argue that antisemitism did not emerge in the Muslim world until modern times, because in their view, it was rare in pre-modern Islam. Lewis argues that there is no sign that any deep-rooted feeling of emotional hostility that can be characterized as antisemitism was directed against Jews or any other group. There were, however, clearly negative attitudes, which were partially due to the &quot;normal&quot; feelings of a dominant group towards subject groups. More specifically, the contempt consisted of Muslim contempt for disbelievers.

===Literature===
According to Lewis, the outstanding characteristic of the classical Islamic view of Jews is their unimportance. The religious, philosophical, and literary Islamic writings tended to ignore Jews and focused more on Christianity. Although the Jews received little praise or even respect and were sometimes blamed for various misdeeds, there were no fears of Jewish conspiracy and domination, nor any charges of diabolic evil, nor accusations of poisoning the wells nor spreading the plague nor were they even accused of engaging in blood libels until Ottomans adopted the concept from their Greek subjects in the 15th century.

Poliakov writes that various examples of medieval Muslim literature portray Judaism as an exemplary pinnacle of faith, and Israel being destined by this virtue. He quotes stories from &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot; that portray Jews as pious, virtuous and devoted to God, and seem to borrow plots from midrashim. However, Poliakov writes that treatment of Jews in Muslim literature varies, and the tales are meant for pure entertainment, with no didactic aim. 

After Ibn Nagraela, a Jew, attacked the Quran by alleging various contradictions in it, Ibn Hazm, a Moor, criticized him furiously. Ibn Hazm wrote that Ibn Nagraela was &quot;filled with hatred&quot; and &quot;conceited in his vile soul&quot;.

According to Schweitzer and Perry, some literature during the 10th and 11th century &quot;made Jews out to be untrustworthy, treacherous oppressors, and exploiters of Muslims&quot;. This propaganda sometimes even resulted in outbreaks of violence against the Jews. An 11th-century Moorish poem describes Jews as &quot;a criminal people&quot; and blames them for causing social decay, betraying Muslims and poisoning food and water.

Martin Kramer writes that in Islamic tradition, in striking contrast with the Christian concept of the eternal Jew, the contemporary Jews were not presented as archetypes—as the embodiment of Jews in all times and places.

===Life under Muslim rule===

Jews, Christians, Sabians, and Zoroastrians living under early and medieval Muslim rule were known as &quot;People of the Book&quot; to Muslims and held the status of &quot;dhimmi&quot;, a status that was later also extended to other non-Muslims like Sikhs, Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. As &quot;dhimmi&quot; they were to be tolerated, and entitled to the protection and resources of the Ummah, or Muslim community. In return, they had to pay a tax known as the &quot;jizya&quot; in accordance with the Quran. Lewis and Poliakov argue that Jewish communities enjoyed toleration and limited rights as long as they accepted Muslim superiority. These rights were legally established and enforced. The restrictions on &quot;dhimmi&quot; included: payment of higher taxes; at some locations, being forced to wear clothing or some other insignia distinguishing them from Muslims; sometimes barred from holding public office, bearing arms or riding a horse; disqualified as witnesses in litigation involving Muslims; at some locations and times, &quot;dhimmi&quot; were prevented from repairing existing or erecting new places of worship. Proselytizing on behalf of any faith but Islam was barred.

&quot;Dhimmi&quot; were subjected to a number of restrictions, the application and severity of which varied with time and place. Restrictions included residency in segregated quarters, obligation to wear distinctive clothing such as the Yellow badge, public subservience to Muslims, prohibitions against proselytizing and against marrying Muslim women, and limited access to the legal system (the testimony of a &quot;dhimmi&quot; did not count if contradicted by that of a Muslim). &quot;Dhimmi&quot; had to pay a special poll tax (the &quot;jizya&quot;), which exempted them from military service, and also from payment of the &quot;zakat&quot; alms tax required of Muslims. In return, &quot;dhimmi&quot; were granted limited rights, including a degree of tolerance, community autonomy in personal matters, and protection from being killed outright. Jewish communities, like Christian ones, were typically constituted as semi-autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership, who carried the responsibility for the community towards the Muslim rulers.

By medieval standards, conditions for Jews under Islam were often more formalized and better than those of Jews in Christian lands, although treatment of Jews in medieval Christian and Islamic countries greatly varied on ruler and nation. This was in part due to the sharing of minority status with Christians in these lands. There is evidence for this claim in that the status of Jews in lands with no Christian minority was usually worse than their status in lands with one. For example, there were numerous incidents of massacres and ethnic cleansing of Jews in North Africa, especially in Morocco, Libya, and Algeria where eventually Jews were forced to live in ghettos. Decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in the Middle Ages in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. At certain times in Yemen, Morocco, and Baghdad, Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face the death penalty. 

Later additions to the code included prohibitions on adopting Arab names, studying the Quran, and selling alcoholic beverages. Abdul Aziz Said writes that the Islamic concept of &quot;dhimmi&quot;, when applied, allowed other cultures to flourish and prevented the general rise of antisemitism. The situation where Jews both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum:

It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.
Schweitzer and Perry give as examples of early Muslim antisemitism: 9th-century &quot;persecution and outbreaks of violence&quot;; 10th- and 11th-century antisemitic propaganda that &quot;made Jews out to be untrustworthy, treacherous oppressors, and exploiters of Muslims&quot;. This propaganda &quot;inspired outbreaks of violence and caused many casualties in Egypt&quot;. An 11th-century Moorish poem describes Jews as &quot;a criminal people&quot; and alleges that &quot;society is nearing collapse on account of Jewish wealth and domination, their exploitation and betrayal of Muslims; that Jews worship the devil, physicians poison their patients, and Jews poison food and water as required by Judaism, and so on.&quot;

Jews under Muslim rule rarely faced martyrdom, exile, or forced conversion to Islam, and they were fairly free to choose their residence and profession. Their freedom and economic condition varied from time to time and place to place. Forced conversions occurred mostly in the Maghreb, especially under the Almohads, a militant dynasty with messianic claims, as well as in Persia, where Shia Muslims were generally less tolerant than their Sunni counterparts. Notable examples of the cases where the choice of residence was taken away from them includes confining Jews to walled quarters (&quot;mellah&quot;) in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century.

===Egypt and Iraq===
The caliphs of Fatimid dynasty in Egypt were known to be Judeophiles, according to Leon Poliakov. They paid regularly to support the Jewish institutions (such as the rabbinical academy of Jerusalem). A significant number of their ministers and counselors were Jews. The Abbasids too similarly were respectful and tolerant towards the Jews under their rule. Benjamin of Tudela, a famous 12th-century Jewish explorer, described the Caliph al-Abbasi as a &quot;great king and kind unto Israel&quot;. Benjamin also further goes on to describe about al-Abassi that &quot;many belonging to the people of Israel are his attendants, he knows all languages and is well-versed in the Law of Israel. He reads and writes the holy language [Hebrew].&quot; He further mentions Muslims and Jews being involved in common devotions, such as visiting the grave of Ezekiel, whom both religions regard as a prophet.

===Iberian Peninsula===
With the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Spanish Judaism flourished for several centuries. Thus, what some refer to as the &quot;golden age&quot; for Jews began. During this period the Muslims of Spain tolerated other religions, including Judaism, and created a heterodox society.

Muslim relations with Jews in Spain were not always peaceful, however. The eleventh century saw Muslim pogroms against Jews in Spain; those occurred in Córdoba in 1011 and in Granada in 1066. In the 1066 Granada massacre, a Muslim mob crucified the Jewish vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred about 4,000 Jews. The Muslim grievance involved was that some Jews had become wealthy, and others had advanced to positions of power.

The Almohad dynasty, which seized rule over Muslim Iberia in the 12th century, offered Christians and Jews the choice of conversion or expulsion; in 1165, one of their rulers ordered that all Jews in the country convert on pain of death (forcing the Jewish rabbi, theologian, philosopher, and physician Maimonides to feign conversion to Islam before fleeing the country). In Egypt, Maimonides resumed practicing Judaism openly only to be accused of apostasy. He was saved from death by Saladin&#x27;s chief administrator, who held that conversion under coercion is invalid.

During his wanderings, Maimonides also wrote The Yemen Epistle, a famous letter to the Jews of Yemen, who were then experiencing severe persecution at the hands of their Muslim rulers. In it, Maimonides describes his assessment of the treatment of the Jews at the hands of Muslims: ... on account of our sins God has cast us into the midst of this people, the nation of Ishmael [that is, Muslims], who persecute us severely, and who devise ways to harm us and to debase us... No nation has ever done more harm to Israel. None has matched it in debasing and humiliating us. None has been able to reduce us as they have... We have borne their imposed degradation, their lies, their absurdities, which are beyond human power to bear... We have done as our sages of blessed memory have instructed us, bearing the lies and absurdities of Ishmael... In spite of all this, we are not spared from the ferocity of their wickedness and their outbursts at any time. On the contrary, the more we suffer and choose to conciliate them, the more they choose to act belligerently toward us.

Mark Cohen quotes Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson, a specialist in medieval European Jewish history, who cautioned that Maimonides&#x27; condemnation of Islam should be understood &quot;in the context of the harsh persecutions of the 12th century and that furthermore one may say that he was insufficiently aware of the status of the Jews in Christian lands, or did not pay attention to this, when he wrote the letter&quot;. Cohen continues by quoting Ben-Sasson, who argues that Jews generally had a better legal and security situation in Muslim countries than Jews had in Christendom.

===Ottoman Empire===
While some Muslim states declined, the Ottoman Empire rose as the &quot;greatest Muslim state in history&quot;. As long as the empire flourished, the Jews did as well, according to Schweitzer and Perry. In contrast with their treatment of Christians, the Ottomans were more tolerant of Jews and promoted their economic development. The Jews flourished as great merchants, financiers, government officials, traders and artisans. The Ottomans also allowed some Jewish immigration to what was then referred to as Syria, which allowed for Zionists to establish permanent settlements in the 1880s.

===Contrast to antisemitism in Christian Europe===

Lewis states that in contrast to Christian antisemitism, the attitude of Muslims towards non-Muslims is not one of hate, fear, or envy, but rather contempt. This contempt is expressed in various ways, such as an abundance of polemic literature which attacks the Christians and occasionally, it also attacks the Jews. &quot;The negative attributes ascribed to the subject religions and their followers are usually expressed in religious and social terms, very rarely are they expressed in ethnic or racial terms, though this sometimes does occur.&quot; The language of abuse is often quite strong. The conventional epithets are apes for Jews, and pigs for Christians. Lewis continues with several examples of regulations which symbolize the inferiority that non-Muslims who lived under Muslim rule had to live with, such as different formulae of greetings when addressing Jews and Christians than when addressing Muslims (both in conversations or correspondences), and forbidding Jews and Christians from choosing names that Muslims chose for their children during Ottoman rule.

Schweitzer and Perry argue that there are two general views of the status of Jews under Islam, the traditional &quot;golden age&quot; and the revisionist &quot;persecution and pogrom&quot; interpretations. The former was first promulgated by Jewish historians in the 19th century as a rebuke of the Christian treatment of Jews, and it was taken up by Arab Muslims after 1948 as &quot;an Arab-Islamist weapon in what is primarily an ideological and political struggle against Israel&quot;. The revisionists argue that this idealized view ignores &quot;a catalog of lesser-known hatred and massacres&quot;. Mark Cohen concurs with this view, arguing that the &quot;myth of an interfaith utopia&quot; went unchallenged until it was adopted by Arabs as a &quot;propaganda weapon against Zionism&quot;, and that this &quot;Arab polemical exploitation&quot; was met with the &quot;counter-myth&quot; of the &quot;neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history&quot;, which also &quot;cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality&quot;.

==Antisemitism in the Islamic Middle East==

Antisemitism has increased in the Muslim world during modern times. While Bernard Lewis and Uri Avnery date the increase in antisemitism to the establishment of Israel, M. Klein suggests that antisemitism could have been present in the mid-19th century.

Scholars point to European influences, including those of the Nazis (see below), and the establishment of Israel as the root causes of antisemitism. Norman Stillman explains that increased European commercial, missionary and imperialist activities during the 19th and 20th centuries brought antisemitic ideas to the Muslim world. Initially these prejudices only found a reception among Arab Christians because they were too foreign to gain any widespread acceptance among Muslims. However, with the rise of the Arab–Israeli conflict, European antisemitism began to gain acceptance in modern literature.

===17th century===
One of the most prominent acts of Islamic antisemitism took place in Yemen between 1679 and 1680, in an event known as the Mawza Exile. During this event the Jews living in nearly all cities and towns throughout Yemen were banished by decree of the Imam of Yemen, Al-Mahdi Ahmad.

===19th century===
According to Mark Cohen, Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose relatively recently, in the 19th century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalisms, and it was primarily imported into the Arab world by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it &quot;Islamised&quot;).

The Damascus affair occurred in 1840, when an Italian monk and his servant disappeared in Damascus. Immediately following it, a charge of ritual murder was brought against a large number of Jews in the city. All of them were found guilty. The consuls of Britain, France and Austria protested against the persecution to the Ottoman authorities, and Christians, Muslims and Jews all played a great role in this affair.

A massacre of Jews also occurred in Baghdad in 1828. There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.

In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of Meshed, a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the Torah scrolls. This is known as the Allahdad incident. It was only by forcible conversion that a massacre was averted.

Benny Morris writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: &quot;I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish gaberdine. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan.&quot;

===20th century===
==== Origins ====

The origins of modern antisemitic trends in the Islamic World can be traced back to the ideas of the Syrian-Egyptian Salafist theologian Muhammad Rashid Rida (1865–1935 CE), who turned highly antisemitic after the British imperial designs on the Arab World after World War 1 and their co-operation with Zionists to further British objectives. The 1988 Hamas Charter, and particularly its Articles 7 and 22, represented a condensed version of the pan-Islamist anti-Jewish ideas cultivated by Rashid Rida. Rida believed that the international Jewry contributed to Germany&#x27;s defeat in the First World War; in exchange for Britain&#x27;s promise to grant them Palestine. Furthermore; he asserted that they controlled Western Banking System and Capitalist system, created Communism in Eastern Europe and led Freemasonry to plot against World Nations. He also drew from Islamic traditions that displayed hostility to Jews and popularised them; rendering the conflict with the Zionists an apocalyptic religious dimension. Rida would persistently cite &quot;hadiths&quot; regarding the End Times Jewish-Muslim conflicts; some of which would be included in the future Charter of Hamas, such as:
The Jews will fight you and you will be led to dominate them until the rock cries out: &quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, kill him!&quot;Rashid Rida condemned the Jews for their arrogance towards the Prophets and arraigned them for abandoning religious values for materialism, all which made them recipients of Divine Wrath; which led to their downfall. He asserted that Allah decreed Muslims to construct Masjid al-Aqsa in the ruins of the Temple in Jerusalem and favoured Muslims to rule the Holy Lands by implementing &quot;shari&#x27;a&quot; (Islamic law) and upholding &quot;Tawhid&quot;. Rashid Rida&#x27;s anti-Zionism was part of his wider campaign as a towering figure in the Pan-Islamist movement and would immensely impact subsequent Islamist, Jihadist and anti-colonial activists. He also severely rebuked Christian Zionists, writing:
==== Early massacres ====
The massacres of Jews in Muslim countries continued into the 20th century. The Jewish quarter in Fez was almost destroyed by a Muslim mob in 1912. There were Nazi-inspired pogroms in Algeria in the 1930s, and massive attacks on the Jews in Iraq and Libya in the 1940s (see Farhud). Pro-Nazi Muslims slaughtered dozens of Jews in Baghdad in 1941.

American academic Bernard Lewis and others have charged that standard antisemitic themes have become commonplace in the publications of Arab Islamist movements such as Hezbollah and Hamas, in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and even in the newspapers and other publications of Refah Partisi, the Turkish Islamic party whose head served as prime minister in 1996–97.&quot; Lewis has also written that the language of abuse is often quite strong, arguing that the conventional epithets for Jews and Christians are apes and pigs, respectively.

On 1 March 1994, Rashid Baz, an American Muslim living in Brooklyn, New York, shot at a van carrying Hassidic Jewish students over the Brooklyn Bridge. The students were returning to Brooklyn after visiting their ailing leader, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who suffered a stroke two years earlier. Ari Halberstam, one of the students, was killed. Others were wounded. Baz was quoted in his confession in 2007 as saying, &quot;I only shot them because they were Jewish.&quot;

====Relations between Nazi Germany and Muslim countries====


Some Arabs found common cause with Nazi Germany against colonial regimes in the Middle East. The influence of the Nazis grew in the Arab world during the 1930s. Egypt, Syria, and Iran are claimed to have harbored Nazi war criminals, though they have rejected this charge. With the recruiting help of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Handschar&quot;, mostly formed by Muslims in 1943, was the first non-Germanic SS division.

=====Amin al-Husseini=====

The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, a pupil of Muhammad Rashid Rida, attempted to create an alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in order to obstruct the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and hinder any emigration by Jewish refugees from the Holocaust there. Historians debate to what extent al-Husseini&#x27;s fierce opposition to Zionism was based on Arab nationalism or antisemitism, or a combination of the two.

On 31 March 1933, within weeks of Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Germany, al-Husseini sent a telegram to Berlin addressed to the German Consul-General in the British Mandate of Palestine saying that Muslims in Palestine and elsewhere looked forward to spreading their ideology in the Middle East. Al-Husseini secretly met the German Consul-General near the Dead Sea in 1933 and expressed his approval of the anti-Jewish boycott in Germany and asked him not to send any Jews to Palestine. Later that year, the Mufti&#x27;s assistants approached Wolff, seeking his help in establishing an Arab National Socialist party in Palestine. Reports reaching the foreign offices in Berlin showed high levels of Arab admiration of Hitler.

Al-Husseini met the German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop on 20 November 1941, and was officially received by Hitler on 30 November 1941, in Berlin. He asked Hitler for a public declaration that &quot;recognized and sympathized with the Arab struggles for independence and liberation, and that it would support the elimination of a national Jewish homeland&quot;, and he submitted to the German government a draft of such a declaration, containing the clause.

Al-Husseini aided the Axis cause in the Middle East by issuing a fatwa for a holy war against Britain in May 1941. The Mufti&#x27;s proclamation against Britain was declared in Iraq, where he was instrumental in the outbreak of the Anglo-Iraqi War of 1941. During the war, the Mufti repeatedly made requests to &quot;the German government to bomb Tel Aviv&quot;.

Al-Husseini was involved in the organization and recruitment of Bosnian Muslims into several divisions of the Waffen SS and other units. and also blessed sabotage teams trained by Germans before they were dispatched to Palestine, Iraq, and Transjordan.

=====Iraq=====

In March 1940, General Rashid Ali, a nationalist Iraqi officer forced the pro-British Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Said Pasha, to resign. In May, he declared jihad against Great Britain, effectively issued a declaration of war. Forty days later, British troops had defeated his forces and occupied the country. The 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état occurred on 3 April 1941, when the regime of the Regent &#x27;Abd al-Ilah was overthrown, and Rashid Ali was installed as Prime Minister.

In 1941, following Rashid Ali&#x27;s pro-Axis coup, riots known as the &quot;Farhud&quot; broke out in Baghdad in which approximately 180 Jews were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.

Iraq initially forbade the emigration of its Jews after the 1948 war on the grounds that allowing them to go to Israel would strengthen that state, but they were allowed to emigrate again after 1950, if they agreed to forgo their assets.

===The Ottoman Empire, Turkey and Iraq===
====Forced migrations of Jews and Assyrian Christians between 1842 and the 21st century====
In his recent PhD thesis and his recent book the Israeli scholar Mordechai Zaken discussed the history of the Assyrian Christians of Turkey and Iraq (in the Kurdish vicinity) during the last 90 years, from 1843 onwards. In his studies Zaken outlines three major eruptions that took place between 1843 and 1933 during which the Assyrian Christians lost their land and hegemony in their habitat in the Hakkārī (or Julamerk) region in southeastern Turkey and became refugees in other lands, notably Iran and Iraq, and they ultimately established exiled communities in European and western countries (the US, Canada, Australia, New-Zealand, Sweden, France, to mention some of these countries). Mordechai Zaken wrote this study from an analytical and comparative point of view, comparing the Assyrian Christians&#x27; experience with the experience of the Kurdish Jews who had been dwelling in Kurdistan for two thousand years or so, but were forced to emigrate to Israel in the early 1950s. The Jews of Kurdistan were forced to leave as a result of the Arab-Israeli war, as a result of increasing hostility and acts of violence which were committed against Jews in Iraqi and Kurdish towns and villages, and as a result of a new situation that developed during the 1940s in Iraq and Kurdistan in which the ability of Jews to live in relative comfort and tolerance (that was disrupted from time to time prior to that period) with their Arab and Muslim neighbors, as they had done for many years, practically came to an end. In the end, the Jews of Kurdistan had to leave their Kurdish habitat en masse and migrate into Israel. The Assyrian Christians, on the other hand, suffered a similar fate but they migrated in stages following each political crisis with the regime in whose boundaries they lived or following each conflict with their Muslim, Turkish, or Arab neighbors, or following the departure or expulsion of their patriarch Mar Shimon in 1933, first to Cyprus and then to the United States. Consequently, although there is still a small and fragile community of Assyrians in Iraq, today, millions of Assyrian Christians live in exiled and prosperous communities in the west.

=====Iran=====
Although Iran was officially neutral during the Second World War, Reza Shah sympathized with Nazi Germany, making the Jewish community fearful of possible persecutions. Although these fears did not materialise, anti-Jewish articles were published in the Iranian media. Following the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941, Reza Shah was deposed and replaced by his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

However, Kaveh Farrokh argues that there is a misconception that antisemitism was widespread in Iran with Reza Shah in power. After the Fall of France during the time that Reza Shah was still regent, the head of the Iranian legation in Paris, Abdol Hossein Sardari, used his influence with Nazi contacts to gain exemptions from Nazi race laws for an estimated 2000 Iranian Jews living in Paris at the time. The legation also issued Iranian travel documents for the Iranian Jews and their non-Iranian family members to facilitate travel through Nazi occupied Europe to safety.

=====Egypt=====

In Egypt, Ahmad Husayn founded the Young Egypt Party in 1933. He immediately expressed his sympathy for Nazi Germany to the German ambassador to Egypt. Husayn sent a delegation to the Nuremberg rally and returned with enthusiasm. After the Sudeten Crisis, the party&#x27;s leaders denounced Germany for aggression against small nations, but they retained elements which were similar to those of Nazism or Fascism, e.g. salutes, torchlight parades, leader worship, and antisemitism and racism. The party&#x27;s impact before 1939 was minimal, and its espionage efforts were of little value to the Germans.

During World War II, Cairo was a haven for agents and spies throughout the war. Egyptian nationalists were active, with many Egyptians, including Farouk of Egypt and prime minister Ali Mahir Pasha, all of whom hoped for an Axis victory, and the complete severance of Egyptian ties with Britain.

====Islamist and Jihadist groups====

Antisemitism, alongside anti-Western sentiment, anti-Israeli sentiment, rejection of democracy, and conspiracy theories involving the Jews, is widespread both within Islamism and Jihadism. Many militant Islamist and Jihadist individuals, groups, and organizations have openly expressed both antisemitic and anti-Zionist views. However, even outside Islamist circles, anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist conspiracism are widespread phenomena in both the Arab world and the Middle East, and it has seen an extraordinary proliferation since the beginning of the Internet Era.

Lashkar-e-Toiba&#x27;s propaganda arm has declared that the Jews are the &quot;Enemies of Islam&quot;, and it has also declared that Israel is the &quot;Enemy of Pakistan&quot;.

Hamas has widely been described as an antisemitic organization. It has issued antisemitic leaflets, and its writings and manifestos rely upon antisemitic documents (the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other works of European Christian literature), exhibiting antisemitic themes. In 1998, Esther Webman of the Project for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Tel Aviv University wrote that although the above is true, antisemitism was not the main tenet of Hamas ideology.

In an editorial in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in January 2006, Khaled Meshaal, the chief of Hamas&#x27;s political bureau denied antisemitism, on Hamas&#x27; part, and he said that the nature of Israeli–Palestinian conflict was not religious but political. He also said that Hamas has &quot;no problem with Jews who have not attacked us&quot;.

The tone and casting of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as part of an eternal struggle between Muslim and Jews by the Hamas Covenant had become an obstacle for the movement to be able to take part in diplomatic forums involving Western nations. The movement came under pressure to update its founding charter issued in 1988 which called for Israel&#x27;s destruction and advocated violent means for achieving a Palestinian state. A new charter issued in May 2014 stated that the group does not seek war with the Jewish people but only against Zionism which it holds responsible for &quot;occupation of Palestine&quot;, while terming Israel as the &quot;Zionist enemy&quot;. It also accepted a Palestinian state within the Green Line as transitional but also advocated &quot;liberation of all of Palestine&quot;.

Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, a Shiite scholar and assistant professor at the Lebanese American University has written that Hezbollah is not anti-Zionist, but rather anti-Jewish. She quoted Hassan Nasrallah as saying: &quot;If we searched the entire world for a person more cowardly, despicable, weak and feeble in psyche, mind, ideology and religion, we would not find anyone like the Jew. Notice, I do not say the Israeli.&quot; Regarding the official public stance of Hezbollah as a whole, she said that while Hezbollah, &quot;tries to mask its anti-Judaism for public-relations reasons ... a study of its language, spoken and written, reveals an underlying truth.&quot; In her book &quot;Hezbollah: Politics &amp; Religion&quot;, she argues that Hezbollah &quot;believes that Jews, by the nature of Judaism, possess fatal character flaws&quot;. Saad-Ghorayeb also said, &quot;Hezbollah&#x27;s Quranic reading of Jewish history has led its leaders to believe that Jewish theology is evil.&quot;

===21st century===
France is home to Europe&#x27;s largest population of Muslims—about 6 million—as well as the continent&#x27;s largest community of Jews, about 600,000. Particularly during the beginning of the second intifada, Muslims attacked synagogues throughout France in solidarity with those in Palestine. Many Jews protested, and the acts were declared &quot;Muslim antisemitism&quot;. By 2007, however, attacks were much less severe, and an &quot;all-clear&quot; was perceived. However, during the 2008–2009 Gaza War, tensions between the two communities increased and there were several dozen reported instances of Muslim violence such as arson and assaults. French Jewish leaders complained of &quot;a diffuse kind of anti-Semitism becoming entrenched in the Muslim community&quot; while Muslim leaders responded that the issues were &quot;political rather than religious&quot; and that Muslim anger is &quot;not against Jews, it&#x27;s against Israel&quot;.

On 28 July 2006, at around 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time, the Seattle Jewish Federation shooting occurred when Naveed Afzal Haq shot six women, one fatally, at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle building in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. He shouted, &quot;I&#x27;m a Muslim American; I&#x27;m angry at Israel&quot; before he began his shooting spree. Police have classified the shooting as a hate crime based on what Haq said during a 9-1-1 call.

In 2012, the Palestinian Authority Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, citing Hadiths, called for the killing of all Jews.

In Egypt, Dar al-Fadhilah published a translation of Henry Ford&#x27;s antisemitic treatise, The International Jew, complete with distinctly antisemitic imagery on the cover.

In 2014 the Anti-Defamation League published a global survey of worldwide antisemitic attitudes, reporting that in the Middle East, 74% of adults agreed with a majority of the survey&#x27;s eleven antisemitic propositions, including that &quot;Jews have too much power in international financial markets&quot; and that &quot;Jews are responsible for most of the world&#x27;s wars.&quot;

==== Saudi school books ====

A May 2006 study of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s revised schoolbook curriculum discovered that the eighth grade books included the following statements,

Heads of American publishing houses have issued a statement asking the Saudi government to delete the &quot;hate&quot;.

According to the Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s November 2018 report, Saudi government-published school textbooks for the 2018–19 academic year promoting incitement to hatred or violence against Jews. The Antisemitic material remains in the Saudi text books, as of November 2019.

====Reconciliation efforts====
In Western countries, some Islamic groups and individual Muslims have made efforts to reconcile with the Jewish community through dialogue and to oppose antisemitism. For instance, in Britain there is the group &quot;Muslims Against Anti-Semitism&quot;. Islamic studies scholar Tariq Ramadan has been outspoken against antisemitism, stating: &quot;In the name of their faith and conscience, Muslims must take a clear position so that a pernicious atmosphere does not take hold in the Western countries. Nothing in Islam can legitimize xenophobia or the rejection of a human being due to his/her religious creed or ethnicity. One must say unequivocally, with force, that anti-Semitism is unacceptable and indefensible.&quot; Mohammad Khatami, former president of Iran, declared antisemitism to be a &quot;Western phenomena&quot;, having no precedents in Islam and stating the Muslims and Jews had lived harmoniously in the past. An Iranian newspaper stated that there has been hatred and hostility in history, but conceded that one must distinguish Jews from Zionists.

In North America, the Council on American-Islamic Relations has spoken against some antisemitic violence, such as the 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting. According to the Anti-Defamation League, CAIR has also been affiliated with antisemitic organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah.

The Saudi mufti, Shaykh Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz, gave a fatwa ruling that negotiating peace with Israel is permissible, as is the cist to Jerusalem by Muslims. He specifically said:

Martin Kramer considers that as &quot;an explicit endorsement of normal relations with Jews&quot;.

====Trends====
According to Norman Stillman, Antisemitism in the Muslim world increased greatly for more than two decades following 1948 but &quot;peaked by the 1970s, and declined somewhat as the slow process of rapprochement between the Arab world and the state of Israel evolved in the 1980s and 1990s&quot;. Johannes J. G. Jansen believes that antisemitism will have no future in the Arab world in the long run. In his view, like other imports from the Western World, antisemitism is unable to establish itself in the private lives of Muslims. In 2004 Khaleel Mohammed said, &quot;Anti-Semitism has become an entrenched tenet of Muslim theology, taught to 95 per cent of the religion&#x27;s adherents in the Islamic world,&quot; a claim immediately dismissed as false and racist by Muslim leaders, who accused Mohammed of destroying efforts at relationship building between Jews and Muslims. In 2010, Moshe Ma&#x27;oz, Professor Emeritus of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies at The Hebrew University, edited a book questioning the common perception Islam is antisemitic or anti-Israel, and maintaining that most Arab regimes and most leading Muslim clerics have a pragmatic attitude to Israel.

According to professor Robert Wistrich, director of the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism (SICSA), the calls for the destruction of Israel by Iran or by Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, or the Muslim Brotherhood, represent a contemporary mode of genocidal antisemitism.

According to the Pew Global Attitudes Project released on 14 August 2005, high percentages of the populations of six Muslim-majority countries have negative views of Jews. To a questionnaire asking respondents to give their views of members of various religions along a spectrum from &quot;very favorable&quot; to &quot;very unfavorable&quot;, 60% of Turks, 74% of Pakistanis, 76% of Indonesians, 88% of Moroccans, 99% of Lebanese Muslims and 100% of Jordanians checked either &quot;somewhat unfavorable&quot; or &quot;very unfavorable&quot; for Jews.

==Islamic antisemitism in Europe==
A 2017 report by the University of Oslo Center for Research on Extremism tentatively suggests that &quot;individuals of Muslim background stand out among perpetrators of antisemitic violence in Western Europe&quot;.

===The Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, antisemitic incidents, from verbal abuse to violence, are reported, allegedly connected with Islamic youth, mostly boys from Moroccan descent. A phrase made popular during football matches against the so-called Jewish football club Ajax has been adopted by Muslim youth and is frequently heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations: &quot;Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!&quot; According to the Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel, a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, in 2009, the number of antisemitic incidents in Amsterdam, the city that is home to most of the approximately 40,000 Dutch Jews, was said to be doubled compared to 2008. In 2010, Raphael Evers, an orthodox rabbi in Amsterdam, told the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten that Jews can no longer be safe in the city anymore due to the risk of violent assaults. &quot;Jews no longer feel at home in the city. Many are considering aliyah to Israel.&quot;

===Belgium===

There were well over a hundred antisemitic attacks recorded in Belgium in 2009. This was a 100% increase from the year before. The perpetrators were usually young males of immigrant background from the Middle East. In 2009, the Belgian city of Antwerp, often referred to as Europe&#x27;s last shtetl, experienced a surge in antisemitic violence. Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam resident and Auschwitz survivor, was quoted in the newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot; in 2010: &quot;The antisemitism now is even worse than before the Holocaust. The antisemitism has become more violent. Now they are threatening to kill us.&quot;

===France===

In 2004, France experienced rising levels of Islamic antisemitism and acts that were publicized around the world. In 2006, rising levels of antisemitism were recorded in French schools. Reports related to the tensions between the children of North African Muslim immigrants and North African Jewish children. The climax was reached when Ilan Halimi was tortured to death by the so-called &quot;Barbarians gang&quot;, led by Youssouf Fofana. In 2007, over 7,000 members of the community petitioned for asylum in the United States, citing antisemitism in France.

Between 2001 and 2005, an estimated 12,000 French Jews took Aliyah to Israel. Several émigrés cited antisemitism and the growing Arab population as reasons for leaving. At a welcoming ceremony for French Jews in the summer of 2004, then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon caused controversy when he advised all French Jews to &quot;move immediately&quot; to Israel and escape what he coined &quot;the wildest anti-semitism&quot; in France.

In the first half of 2009, an estimated 631 recorded acts of antisemitism took place in France, more than in the whole of 2008. Speaking to the World Jewish Congress in December 2009, the French Interior Minister Hortefeux described the acts of antisemitism as &quot;a poison to our republic&quot;. He also announced that he would appoint a special coordinator for fighting racism and antisemitism.

The rise of antisemitism in modern France has been linked to the intensifying Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Since the Gaza War in 2009, decreases in antisemitism have been reversed. A report compiled by the Coordination Forum for Countering Anti-Semitism singled out France in particular among Western countries for antisemitism. Between the start of the Israeli offensive in Gaza in late December and the end of it in January, an estimated hundred antisemitic acts were recorded in France. This compares with a total of 250 antisemitic acts in the whole of 2007.
In 2012, Mohammed Merah killed four Jews, including three children, at the Ozar HaTorah Jewish school in Toulouse.
Shortly after the Charlie Hebdo shooting in 2015, Amedy Coulibaly murdered four Jewish patrons of a Kosher supermarket in Paris and held fifteen people hostage in the Porte de Vincennes siege.
In response to these high-profile attacks, Jewish emigration from France to Israel increased by 20%, to 5,100 per year, between 2014 and 2015.

===Germany===
According to a 2012 survey, 18% of Turks in Germany believe that Jews are inferior human beings. A &quot;non-representative study&quot; by the Ramer Institute for Jewish-German Relations suggests that antisemitic views were especially prevalent among Germany&#x27;s native-born Muslim youth and children of immigrants.

A 2023 survey found that 26% of German Muslim respondents agreed with the antisemitic statement that &quot;wealthy Jews are the real rulers of the world&quot;, compared to the national average of just 4%, and were overall three or four times more likely than the national average to embrace antisemitic ideology. Seven percent of German Muslim respondents agreed that violence against Jews was acceptable, compared to 2% of the national average.

In police statistics more than 90 percent of incidents are counted as &quot;right wing extremism&quot;. According to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, government officials and Jewish leaders doubt that figure, because cases with unknown perpetrators and some kinds of attacks automatically get classified as &quot;extreme right&quot;. A 2017 study of Jewish perspectives on antisemitism in Germany by Bielefeld University found that individuals and groups which belong to the extreme right and the extreme left were equally represented as perpetrators of antisemitic harassment and assaults, while a large number of the attacks were committed by Muslim assailants. The study also found that 70% of the participants feared a rise in antisemitism due to immigration, citing potential antisemitism among refugees.

Following the October 7th massacre of Israelis by Palestinians, dozens of Arab and Muslim residents of Neukölln celebrated on the streets of the neighbourhood, some handing out sweets and candy. Since then, antisemitism and Holocaust denial among the Muslim population of Germany has surged, with Jew-hatred &quot;becoming mainstream among youths and young adults in some Arab communities&quot;. Neukölln’s integration commissioner, Güner Balci, stated that antisemitism is &quot;widespread in certain Muslim milieus&quot;, and criticised the failure of any of Germany’s mosques to condemn unequivocally the violence of the 7 October massacre.

In November 2024, Berlin’s chief of police Barbara Slowik also warned that Jews and gay people should hide their identity in order to protect their safety when entering Arab and Muslim-majority neighbourhoods and that &quot;There are certain neighbourhoods where the majority of people of Arab origin live, who also have sympathies for terrorist groups&quot; and are &quot;openly hostile towards Jews&quot;. A week earlier, a group of Jewish schoolchildren in a youth soccer team were &quot;hunted down&quot; and attacked with knives by pro-Palestinian Arabs.

===Sweden===
A government study in 2006 estimated that 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims &quot;harbour systematic antisemitic views&quot;. The former prime minister Göran Persson described these results as &quot;surprising and terrifying&quot;. However, the rabbi of Stockholm&#x27;s Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said, &quot;It&#x27;s not true to say that the Swedes are antisemitic. Some of them are hostile to Israel because they support the weak side, which they perceive the Palestinians to be.&quot;

In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzki told &quot;Die Presse&quot;, an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being &quot;harassed and physically attacked&quot; by &quot;people from the Middle East&quot;, although he added that only a small number of Malmö&#x27;s 40,000 Muslims &quot;exhibit hatred of Jews&quot;. Sieradzk also stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malmö to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment. Also in March, the Swedish newspaper &quot;Skånska Dagbladet&quot; reported that attacks on Jews in Malmö totaled 79 in 2009, about twice as many as the previous year, according to police statistics.

In early 2010, the Swedish publication &quot;The Local&quot; published series of articles about the growing antisemitism in Malmö, Sweden. In an interview in January 2010, Fredrik Sieradzki of the Jewish Community of Malmö stated, &quot;Threats against Jews have increased steadily in Malmö in recent years and many young Jewish families are choosing to leave the city. Many feel that the community and local politicians have shown a lack of understanding for how the city&#x27;s Jewish residents have been marginalized.&quot; He also added, &quot;right now many Jews in Malmö are really concerned about the situation here and don&#x27;t believe they have a future here.&quot; &quot;The Local&quot; also reported that Jewish cemeteries and synagogues have repeatedly been defaced with antisemitic graffiti, and a chapel at another Jewish burial site in Malmö was firebombed in 2009. In 2009 the Malmö police received reports of 79 antisemitic incidents, double the number of the previous year (2008). Fredrik Sieradzki, spokesman for the Malmö Jewish community, estimated that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5% a year. &quot;Malmö is a place to move away from,&quot; he said, citing antisemitism as the primary reason.

In October 2010, &quot;The Forward&quot; reported on the current state of Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and professor of history at the University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. But such public rhetoric is not branded hateful and denounced. Charles Small, director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Antisemitism, stated, &quot;Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It&#x27;s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.&quot; Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;, has sharply criticized politicians who he claims offer &quot;weak excuses&quot; for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. &quot;Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying the behavior of these kids is in some way our fault.&quot; Judith Popinski, an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. Popinski, who found refuge in Malmö in 1945, stated that, until recently, she told her story in Malmö schools as part of their Holocaust studies program, but that now, many schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect, either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class. She further stated, &quot;Malmö reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war. &quot;I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore.&quot;

In December 2010, the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express &quot;extreme caution&quot; when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens by Muslims in the city of Malmö.

===Norway===

In 2010, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among Norwegian Muslims. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often &quot;praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews&quot;, that &quot;Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students&quot; and that &quot;Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the Holocaust&quot;. Additionally, while some students might protest when some express support for terrorism, none object when students express hatred of Jews. Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. A Jewish father also reported that after school his child was taken by a Muslim mob out to the forest to be hanged because he was a Jew, although he managed to escape.

===United Kingdom===

According to British Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan, &quot;anti-Semitism isn&#x27;t just tolerated in some sections of the British Muslim community; it&#x27;s routine and commonplace&quot;. A 2016 survey of 5,446 adult Britons, part of a report titled &quot;Anti-Semitism in contemporary Great Britain&quot; that was conducted by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research, found that the prevalence of antisemitic views among Muslims was two to four times higher than the rest of the population. Antisemitic views were on average twice as high among British Muslims compared to the average British population. 55% of British Muslims held at least one antisemitic view, and the survey found there was a correlation between higher levels of Muslim religiosity and education and their endorsement of antisemitic theories. A 2020 poll found that 45% of British Muslims hold a generally favourable view of British Jews, and 18% hold a negative view.

Following the October 7th massacre of Israelis by Palestinians, a UK survey found that 46% of British Muslim respondents said they sympathise with Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, and the same percentage agreed that &quot;Jews have too much influence over UK government policy&quot;. 41% agreed with the statement that &quot;Jews have too much power over UK media&quot;, 39% agreed that &quot;Jews have too much power over the UK financial system&quot;, 33.6% agreed that &quot;Jews have too much control of the global media system&quot;, 33.1% agreed that &quot;Jews have too much control over global political leadership&quot;, and 32% wanted Sharia law to be implemented in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="165403" wikidata="Q1248663" url="?curid=165403" title="The Old Grey Whistle Test">
<text>The Old Grey Whistle Test (sometimes abbreviated to Whistle Test or OGWT) is a British former television music show. The show was devised by BBC producer Rowan Ayers, commissioned by David Attenborough and aired on BBC2 from 1971 to 1988. It took over the BBC2 late-night slot from &quot;Disco 2&quot;, which ran between September 1970 and July 1971, while continuing to feature non-chart music. The original producer, involved in an executive capacity throughout the show&#x27;s entire history, was Michael Appleton.

According to presenter Bob Harris, the programme derived its name from a Tin Pan Alley phrase from years before. When they got the first pressing of a record they would play it to people they called &quot;the old greys&quot; – doormen in grey suits. Any song the doormen could remember and whistle, having heard it just once or twice, had passed the old grey whistle test.

On 23 February 2018, a one-off live three-hour special of &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; was broadcast on BBC Four, hosted by Harris to mark 30 years since the final episode had been broadcast.

==History==
Launched on BBC2, the show focused on albums, rather than chart hits covered on BBC1 by &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. It was originally produced in a studio at BBC Television Centre in west London known as &quot;Pres B&quot;, which had been originally designed for shooting weather forecasts and in-vision continuity. The studio was only . Due to the lack of technology that accommodated live performances, bands mimed to tracks in early episodes.

The series&#x27; opening titles theme was an animation of a male figure made up of stars (known as the &#x27;Star Kicker&#x27;) dancing. The programme&#x27;s title music, with its harmonica theme, was a track called Stone Fox Chase by a Nashville band, Area Code 615.

The first host was Richard Williams, features editor of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the music weekly. From 1972 the programme was presented by disc jockey Bob Harris (nicknamed ‘Whispering Bob Harris’ because of his quiet voice and laid-back style). He later became notorious among the younger generation for distancing himself on air from Roxy Music&#x27;s first performance on the show and calling the New York Dolls &quot;mock rock&quot; and left &quot;OGWT&quot; in 1978.

In the programme&#x27;s early days, before the advent of the music video, tracks that could not be performed live by musicians were accompanied by old film footage, edited especially for the programme by film collector and archivist Philip Jenkinson.

After Harris&#x27;s departure Annie Nightingale took over as host. In December 1980 Nightingale presented a special edition immediately after the murder of John Lennon (who had appeared on the show in 1975). This particular episode consisted almost entirely of interviews with various people about Lennon&#x27;s life and career.

Following the departure of Nightingale in 1982, Mark Ellen, David Hepworth and Richard Skinner also took turns as presenters. In 1983 the programme was moved to a live mid-evening slot. The title was abridged to Whistle Test and the title credits and music were changed. Andy Kershaw joined the series as a presenter in 1984. The same four presenters co-presented the BBC&#x27;s television coverage of Live Aid in 1985.

The series was cancelled in early 1987 by Janet Street-Porter, who had been appointed head of Youth Programmes at the BBC. The series ended with a live New Year&#x27;s Eve special, hosted by Bob Harris, broadcast through to the early hours of New Year&#x27;s Day 1988: material included &quot;Hotel California&quot; by Eagles, live from 1977, and &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; by Meat Loaf.

Owing to technical issues during the show&#x27;s early years and the need to ensure performances were controlled, the bands often recorded the instrumental tracks the day before. The vocals were then performed live &quot;99 percent&quot; of the time. After 1973 the show changed to an entirely live format.

=== 30th anniversary ===
On 23 February 2018 the BBC broadcast a special programme, hosted by Bob Harris, to mark 30 years since the series was last broadcast. This live studio show featured music, special guests and rare archive footage. It featured live performances from Gary Numan, Kiki Dee, Peter Frampton, Wildwood Kin, Richard Thompson, Albert Lee and Robert Vincent.

Harris chatted to &quot;Whistle Test&quot; alumni, including Gary Numan, Dave Stewart, Joan Armatrading, Ian Anderson, Toyah Willcox, Dennis Locorriere, Chris Difford and Kiki Dee, as well as fan Danny Baker.

Gary Numan&#x27;s performances on the show caused his latest album, &quot;Savage (Songs from a Broken World)&quot;, to re-enter the charts the following week at number 60.

<doc id="165404" wikidata="Q208481" url="?curid=165404" title="Sanhedrin">
<text>The Sanhedrin (Hebrew and Middle Aramaic , a loanword from , &#x27;assembly,&#x27; &#x27;sitting together,&#x27; hence &#x27;assembly&#x27; or &#x27;council&#x27;) was a legislative and judicial assembly of either 23 or 70 elders, existing at both a local and central level in the ancient Land of Israel.

There were two classes of Rabbinite courts called sanhedrins: Greater and Lesser. A lesser Sanhedrin of 23 judges was appointed to sit as a tribunal in each city. There was only one Great Sanhedrin of 70 judges, which, among other roles, acted as a supreme court, taking appeals from cases that lesser courts decided. In general usage, &quot;the Sanhedrin&quot; without qualifier usually refers to the Great Sanhedrin, which was presided over by the Nasi, who functioned as its head or representing president, and was a member of the court; the Av Beit Din or the chief of the court, who was second to the Nasi and 69 general members.

In the Second Temple period, the Great Sanhedrin met in the Temple in Jerusalem, in a building called the Hall of Hewn Stones. The Great Sanhedrin convened every day except festivals and the sabbath day (Shabbat).

After the destruction of the Second Temple and the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt, the Great Sanhedrin moved to Galilee, which became part of the Roman province of Syria Palaestina. In this period, the Sanhedrin was sometimes called the &quot;Galilean Patriarchate&quot; or &quot;Patriarchate of Palaestina&quot;, the governing legal body of Galilean Jewry. In the late 200s CE, to avoid persecution, the name &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; was dropped and its decisions were issued under the name of (house of learning). The last universally binding decision of the Great Sanhedrin appeared in 358 when the Hebrew calendar was established. The Great Sanhedrin was finally disbanded in 425.

Over the centuries, attempts have been made to revive the institution, such as the Grand Sanhedrin convened by Napoleon Bonaparte and modern attempts in Israel.

== Hebrew Bible ==
In the Hebrew Bible, Moses and the Israelites were commanded by God to establish courts of judges. They were also commanded to establish a &quot;supreme court&quot; located at the central sanctuary (after arriving in the Land of Israel), to handle cases too difficult for local courts.

When Moses declared that the task of leading the people was too difficult for him, God had him appoint 70 elders (&quot;zekenim&quot;) to share the burden of leadership with him. According to the Mishnah, these 70 elders plus Moses himself are the source for the 71 judges of the &quot;Great Sanhedrin&quot;. These elders are described as &quot;the elders of the people and its officers&quot;, according to a midrash, they were the same officers who were beaten in Egyptian slavery for failing to meet Pharaoh&#x27;s quota of bricks, and after the Exodus were rewarded with membership on the first Sanhedrin.

The 23 judges of the &quot;Lesser Sanhedrin&quot; are derived from the following exegesis: it must be possible for a &quot;community&quot; to vote for both conviction and exoneration (). The minimum size of a &quot;community&quot; is 10 men, thus 10 vs 10. One more is required to achieve a majority (11 vs. 10), but a simple majority cannot convict (), and so an additional judge is required (12 vs. 10). Finally, a court should have an odd number of judges to prevent deadlocks; thus 23 rather than 22.

== History ==
=== Early Sanhedrin ===
The first historic mention of a &quot;Synedrion&quot; (Greek: ) occurs in the Psalms of Solomon (17:49), a Jewish religious book translated into Greek.

The Hasmonean court in Judea, presided over by Alexander Jannaeus, until 76 BCE, followed by his wife, Queen Salome Alexandra, was called or &quot;Sanhedrin.&quot; The exact nature of this early Sanhedrin is not clear. It may have been a body of sages or priests, or a political, legislative and judicial institution. The first historical record of the body was during the administration of Aulus Gabinius, who, according to Josephus, organized five in 57 BCE as Roman administration was not concerned with religious affairs unless sedition was suspected. Only after the destruction of the Second Temple was the Sanhedrin made up only of sages.

Josephus describes a &quot;synhedrion&quot; for the first time in connection with the decree of the Roman governor of Syria, Aulus Gabinius (57 BCE), who abolished the constitution and the then existing form of government of Judea and divided the country into five provinces, at the head of each of which a &quot;synhedrion&quot; was placed; Jerusalem was the seat of one of these. Later, Josephus describes Herod (at the time governor of Galilee) as being summoned before the &quot;synhedrion&quot;, led by High Priest Hyrcanus II, due to having executed alleged criminals without permission from the &quot;synhedrion&quot;. Eventually, though, Herod would go on to kill many members of this &quot;synhedrion&quot;.

The Mishnah describes the Sanhedrin in this period further. The Great Sanhedrin met in the Hall of Hewn Stones in the Temple in Jerusalem. It convened every day except festivals and Shabbat. Its members included priests, Levites, and ordinary Jews whose families had a pure lineage such that their daughters were allowed to marry priests.

=== The trial of Jesus, and early Christianity ===
A is mentioned 22 times in the Greek New Testament, including in the Gospels in relation to the trial of Jesus, and in the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;, which mentions a &quot;Great &quot; in chapter 5 where rabbi Gamaliel appeared, and also in chapter 7 in relation to the stoning death of Saint Stephen. This body is described as a court led by the High Priest or leading priests, as well as the &quot;elders&quot; and/or Pharisees.

=== During Jewish–Roman Wars ===
After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Sanhedrin was re-established in Yavneh, with reduced authority, by agreement between Yochanan ben Zakai and Roman Emperor Vespasian. Vespasian agreed in part due to the perception that the Pharisees had not participated in the first revolt to the extent that other groups had. Thus the Sanhedrin in Yavneh was comprised almost exclusively of pharisaic scholars. The imperial Roman government recognized the Sanhedrin. They regarded the head of the Sanhedrin as their own paid government official with the status of a prefect. Roman legislation severely reduced the scope of its authority, but confirmed the body&#x27;s ultimate authority in religious matters. In an attempt to quash revolutionary elements, Rome in effect declared one form of Judaism to be the only recognized form of religion. This led to persecution of sectarian groups, and attempts by these groups to find fault with the Sanhedrin before the Roman government. 

The seat of the Patriarchate moved to Usha under the presidency of Gamaliel II in 80 CE. In 116 it moved back to Yavneh, and then again back to Usha. 

=== After Bar Kokhba Revolt ===

Rabbinic texts indicate that following the Bar Kokhba revolt, southern Galilee became the seat of rabbinic learning in the Land of Israel. This region was the location of the court of the Patriarch which was situated first at Usha, then at Bet Shearim, later at Sepphoris and finally at Tiberias.

The Great Sanhedrin moved in 140 to Shefaram under the presidency of Shimon ben Gamliel II, and subsequently to Beit She&#x27;arim and later to Sepphoris, under the presidency of Judah ha-Nasi (165–220). Finally, it moved to Tiberias in 220, under the presidency of Gamaliel III (220–230), a son of Judah ha-Nasi, where it became more of a consistory, but still retained, under the presidency of Judah II (230–270), the power of excommunication.

During the presidency of Gamaliel IV (270–290), due to Roman persecution, it dropped the name Sanhedrin; and its authoritative decisions were subsequently issued under the name of &quot;Beth HaMidrash&quot;.

In the year 363, the emperor Julian (r. 355–363 CE), an apostate from Christianity, ordered the Temple rebuilt. The project&#x27;s failure has been ascribed to the Galilee earthquake of 363, and to the Jews&#x27; ambivalence about the project. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire. Divine intervention was the common view among Christian historians of the time. As a reaction against Julian&#x27;s pro-Jewish stance, the later emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395 CE) forbade the Sanhedrin to assemble and declared ordination illegal. Capital punishment was prescribed for any Rabbi who received ordination, as well as complete destruction of the town where the ordination occurred.

However, since the Hebrew calendar was based on witnesses&#x27; testimony, which had become far too dangerous to collect, rabbi Hillel II recommended change to a mathematically based calendar that was adopted at a clandestine, and maybe final, meeting in 358 CE. This marked the last universal decision made by the Great Sanhedrin.

Gamaliel VI (400–425) was the Sanhedrin&#x27;s last president. With his death in 425, Theodosius II outlawed the title of Nasi, the last remains of the ancient Sanhedrin. An imperial decree of 426 diverted the patriarchs&#x27; tax () into the imperial treasury. The exact reason for the abrogation of the patriarchate is not clear, though Gamaliel VI, the last holder of the office who had been for a time elevated by the emperor to the rank of prefect, may have fallen out with the imperial authorities. Thereafter, Jews were gradually excluded from holding public office. A law dated to 429, however, refers to the existence of a Sanhedrin in each of the Eastern Roman provinces of Palestine.

== Powers ==
The Talmud tractate Sanhedrin identifies two classes of rabbinical courts called Sanhedrin, a Great Sanhedrin () and a Lesser Sanhedrin (). Each city could have its own lesser Sanhedrin of 23 judges, but there could be only one greater Sanhedrin of 71, which among other roles acted as the Supreme Court, taking appeals from cases decided by lesser courts. The uneven numbers of judges were predicated on eliminating the possibility of a tie, and the last to cast his vote was the head of the court.

=== Function and procedures ===
The Sanhedrin as a body claimed powers that lesser Jewish courts did not have. As such, they were the only ones who could try the king, extend the boundaries of the Temple and Jerusalem, and were the ones to whom all questions of law were finally put. Moreover, the lesser Sanhedrin of 23 judges was the only juridical body in Israel having the statutory and constitutional authority and power to render a verdict of capital punishment to would-be offenders, and the greater Sanhedrin of 71 judges was solely authorized to send forth the people to a battle waged of free choice. 

Before 191 BCE the High Priest acted as the &quot;ex officio&quot; head of the Sanhedrin, but in 191 BCE, when the Sanhedrin lost confidence in the High Priest, the office of Nasi was created. After the time of Hillel the Elder (late 1st century BCE and early 1st century CE), the Nasi was almost invariably a descendant of Hillel. The second highest-ranking member of the Sanhedrin was called the Av Beit Din, or &#x27;Head of the Court&#x27; (literally, means &#x27;father of the house of judgment&#x27;), who presided over the Sanhedrin when it sat as a criminal court. 

During the Second Temple period, the Sanhedrin met in a building known as the Hall of Hewn Stones (), which has been placed by the Talmud and many scholars as built into the northern wall of the Temple Mount, half inside the sanctuary and half outside, with doors providing access variously to the Temple and to the outside. The name presumably arises to distinguish it from the buildings in the Temple complex used for ritual purposes, which could not be constructed of stones hewn by any iron implement.

In some cases, it was necessary only for a 23-member panel (functioning as a Lesser Sanhedrin) to convene. In general, the full panel of 71 judges was convened only on matters of national significance (&quot;e.g.&quot;, a declaration of war) or when the 23-member panel failed to reach a conclusive verdict.

By the end of the Second Temple period, the Sanhedrin reached its pinnacle of importance, legislating all aspects of Jewish religious and political life within parameters laid down by Biblical and Rabbinic tradition.

=== Summary of Patriarchal powers ===
The following is a summary of the powers and responsibilities of the Patriarchate from the onset of the third century, based on rabbinic sources as understood by L.I. Levine:
#Representative to Imperial authorities;
#Focus of leadership in the Jewish community:
##Receiving daily visits from prominent families;
##Declaration of public fast days;
##Initiating or abrogating the ban (&quot;herem&quot;);
#Appointment of judges to Jewish courts in the Land of Israel;
#Regulation of the calendar;
#Issuing enactments and decrees with respect to the applicability or release from legal requirements, e.g.:
##Use of sabbatical year produce and applicability of sabbatical year injunctions;
##Repurchase or redemption of formerly Jewish land from gentile owners;
##Status of Hellenistic cities of the Land of Israel re: purity, tithing, sabbatical year;
##Exemptions from tithing;
##Conditions in divorce documents;
##Use of oil produced by gentiles;
#Dispatching emissaries to diaspora communities;
#Taxation: both the power to tax and the authority to rule/intervene on the disposition of taxes raised for local purposes by local councils.

Up to the middle of the fourth century, the Patriarchate retained the prerogative of determining the Hebrew calendar and guarded the intricacies of the needed calculations, in an effort to constrain interference by the Babylonian community. Christian persecution obliged Hillel II to fix the calendar in permanent form in 359 CE. This institution symbolized the passing of authority from the Patriarchate to the Babylonian Talmudic academies.

=== Archaeological findings ===
In 2004, excavations in Tiberias conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority uncovered a structure dating to the 3rd century CE that may have been the seat of the Sanhedrin when it convened in that city. At the time it was called .

== Nasi (president) ==

Before 191 BCE the High Priest acted as the &quot;ex officio&quot; head of the Sanhedrin, but in 191 BCE, when the Sanhedrin lost confidence in the High Priest, the chair passed to the new office of the Nasi. The Sanhedrin was headed by the chief scholars of the great Talmudic Academies in the Land of Israel, and with the decline of the Sanhedrin, their spiritual and legal authority was generally accepted, the institution itself being supported by voluntary contributions by Jews throughout the ancient world. 

Being a member of the house of Hillel and thus a descendant of King David, the Nasi (prince), who was the chairman of the assembly, enjoyed almost royal authority. His functions were political rather than religious, though the office’s influence was not limited to the secular realm. The Patriarchate attained its zenith under Judah ha-Nasi, who compiled the Mishnah.

== Revival attempts ==
=== Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s &quot;Grand Sanhedrin&quot; ===
The &quot;Grand Sanhedrin&quot; was a Jewish high court convened by Napoleon I to give legal sanction to the principles expressed by the Assembly of Notables in answer to the twelve questions submitted to it by the government. It did not follow the halakhic procedures of the traditional Sanhedrin.

On 6 October 1806, the Assembly of Notables issued a proclamation to all the Jewish communities of Europe, inviting them to send delegates to the Sanhedrin, to convene on 20 October. This proclamation, written in Hebrew, French, German, and Italian, speaks in extravagant terms of the importance of this revived institution and of the greatness of its imperial protector. While the action of Napoleon aroused in many Jews of Germany the hope that, influenced by it, their governments also would grant them the rights of citizenship, others looked upon it as a political contrivance. When in the war against Prussia (1806–07) the emperor invaded Poland and the Jews rendered great services to his army, he remarked, laughing, &quot;The sanhedrin is at least useful to me.&quot; David Friedländer and his friends in Berlin described it as a spectacle that Napoleon offered to the Parisians.

Since the dissolution of the Sanhedrin in or around 358 CE, there have been several attempts to re-establish it.

There are records of what may have been attempts to reform the Sanhedrin in Arabia, in Jerusalem under the Caliph Umar, and in Babylon (Iraq), but none of these attempts were given attention by later rabbinic authorities and little information is available about them.

Maimonides (1135–1204) proposed a rationalist solution for achieving the goal of re-establishing &quot;semikhah&quot; and the Sanhedrin. There have been several attempts to implement Maimonides&#x27; recommendations by Rabbi Jacob Berab in 1538, Rabbi Yisroel Shklover in 1830, Rabbi Aharon Mendel haCohen in 1901, Rabbi Zvi Kovsker in 1940, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Maimon in 1949, and a group of Israeli rabbis in 2004.

<text>Artificial humans and autonomous artificial servants have a long history in human culture, though the term Robot and its modern literary conception as a mobile machine equipped with an advanced artificial intelligence are more fairly recent. The literary role of artificial life has evolved over time: early myths present animated objects as instruments of divine will, later stories treat their attempted creation as a blasphemy with inevitable consequences, and modern tales range from apocalyptic warnings against blind technological progress to explorations of the ethical questions raised by the possibility of sentient machines.

Recently, a popular overview of the history of androids, robots, cyborgs and replicants from antiquity to the present has been published.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser/Rossbach&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Treated fields of knowledge are: history of technology, history of medicine, philosophy, literature, film and art history, the range of topics discussed is worldwide.

==Early uses==
The earliest examples were all presented as the results of divine intervention and include: The dry bones that came to life in the Book of Ezekiel (Chapter 37); three-legged self-navigating tables created by the god Hephaestus (Iliad xviii); and the statue Galatea, brought to life by the prayers of her creator Pygmalion.

More recent humaniform examples include the brooms from the legend of the sorcerer&#x27;s apprentice derived from a tale by Lucian of Samosata in the 1st century AD, the Jewish legend of the golem created like Adam from clay, and Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. These tales include an indictment of human folly at presuming to take on the role of creator.

Notable mechanical representations of humans include the life-sized singing puppet &quot;Olimpia&quot; in the short story &quot;The Sandman&quot; by E. T. A. Hoffmann in 1816 and a bipedal anthropomorphic mechanism in &quot;The Steam Man of the Prairies&quot; by Edward S. Ellis in 1868. These examples are stories about human-controlled mechanisms without autonomy or self-awareness.

In Lyman Frank Baum&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, the first-ever introduction of a humanoid-appearance mechanical man that would satisfy the later &quot;humanoid robot&quot; definition occurred in 1907 - some fifteen years before the word &quot;robot&quot; was coined - with Tik-Tok, powered with a trio of clockwork movements for his thinking, movement and speech, none of which he could wind up himself.

In 1912, Selma Lagerlöf published the poem &quot;Slåtterkarlarna på Ekolsund&quot; which was published in the first part of &quot;Troll och människor&quot;. In the poem Christopher Polhem is hired to create mechanical mowers for a farmer.

==The modern &quot;robot&quot;==
The first use of the word &quot;robot&quot; was in Karel Čapek&#x27;s play &quot;R.U.R. (Rossum&#x27;s Universal Robots)&quot; written in 1920 and first performed in Czechoslovakia in 1921, in New York City in 1922 and an English edition published in 1923. Čapek&#x27;s Robots are artificially manufactured from organic materials to labor for humans, and as the play progresses they revolt and overthrow their human creators. However, the play ends on an optimistic note: Robots&#x27; artificial biology causes a male and female Robot to fall in love, preserving the spirit of humanity as a result. &quot;R. U. R.&quot; and its Robots reflect contemporary anxieties about dehumanization amid the mass industrialization and militarism of the early twentieth century.

While Karel Čapek&#x27;s play introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; into languages around the globe, he later wrote a letter to the Oxford English Dictionary of etymology in which he named his brother, painter and writer Josef Čapek, as its true inventor. In an article in the Czech Lidové noviny in 1933 he also explains that he originally wanted to call the creatures &quot;laboři&quot; from the Latin word &quot;labor&quot;. Karel found the word too bookish and sought advice from Josef who suggested to call them &quot;robots&quot;. The word, which is always capitalized in Čapek&#x27;s play, derives from &quot;robota&quot; which means &quot;drudgery&quot; in Czech and means &quot;work&quot; in Slovak.)

The theme of robots has been picked up by science fiction writers and many volumes are focused on robots and their interaction with the human species. Of particular note is the work of Isaac Asimov as a large part of his work centers on robots. Asimov is particularly known for his creation of the Three laws of robotics which that author uses in stories as both to define his robots and how these interact within the worlds he creates.

<doc id="165411" wikidata="Q701661" url="?curid=165411" title="Administrative divisions of Taiwan">
<text>Taiwan (Republic of China) is divided into multi-layered statutory subdivisions. Due to the complex political status of Taiwan, there is a significant difference in the &quot;de jure&quot; system set out in the original constitution and the &quot;de facto&quot; system in use today.

The ROC defines the Taiwan Area (Free Area) as its actual controlled territories, which is constitutionally divided into two provinces and six special municipalities, with each province subdivided into cities and counties. After a constitutional amendment in 1997, the provinces became non-self-governing bodies and remained as nominal divisions under the constitution, with no governing powers. The provincial governments were abolished in 2018. Provincial borders remained for statistical purposes.

With provinces non-functional in practice, Taiwan is divided into 22 subnational divisions (6 special municipalities, 3 cities, and 13 counties), each with a local government led by an elected head and a local council. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities; these divisions have a degree of autonomy with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county governments. Matters for which local governments are responsible or partially responsible include social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.

When the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1 special administrative region (Hainan) and several autonomous regions (Tibet, reclaimed Outer Mongolia in 1953). However, since its retreat, the ROC has controlled only Taiwan Province and some islands of Fujian Province. The ROC also controls the Pratas Island and Taiping Island in the Spratly Islands, which are part of the disputed South China Sea Islands. They were placed under Kaohsiung administration after the retreat to Taiwan.

Since 1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control. Taipei became a special municipality in 1967 and Kaohsiung in 1979. The two provincial governments were &quot;streamlined&quot;, with their functions transferred to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998). In 2010, New Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan were upgraded to special municipalities. And in 2014, Taoyuan County was also upgraded to Taoyuan special municipality. This brought the top-level divisions to their current state:

According to Article 4 of the Local Government Act, laws pertaining to special municipalities also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million. This provision does not currently apply to any county, although it previously applied to Taipei County (now New Taipei City) and Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City).

==History==
===Territory===
After the World War II in 1945, the Republic of China (1912–1949) received Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) from the Empire of Japan. After the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the ROC was reduced to mainly the island of Taiwan and some offshore islands, with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) controlling the mainland. However, it continued to formally claim all 35 provinces (including those that no longer form part of the area of the People&#x27;s Republic of China) in official maps by the ROC government and ignored the changes imposed by the PRC. After 1953, the authorities in Taiwan once claimed that Mongolia was ROC territory, but this claim was abolished under the Chen Shui-bian administration in 2002. By 1967 and 1979, the ROC set up Taipei and Kaohsiung as its special municipalities, with three more added in 2010 and one in 2014. As of 2025, the ROC has not officially renounced claims in mainland China ruled by the CCP, though the ROC has also not recently published official maps depicting mainland China as part of its territory.

This history gives two different sources of the current Taiwanese administrative divisions on the free area of the Republic of China or Taiwan Area.
* Taiwan Province: The island of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores): inherited from the divisions of Taiwan under the Empire of Japan.
* Fuchien Province: Kinmen (Quemoy) and the Matsu Islands – offshore islands inherited from the ROC&#x27;s Fuchien divisions. The original province was partitioned between the PRC and the ROC following the Battle of Guningtou in 1949. In addition, the ROC still controls over Pratas Island and part of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. These were originally part of the Hainan Special Administrative Region, but were transferred to the special municipality of Kaohsiung in 1996. These provinces were streamlined in 1998 and their governments became non-functional in 2019.

===Changes to divisions===
Since 1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control. The two provincial governments were downscaled and much of their functions transferred to the central or county governments. Six special municipalities have been created.

Since 1949, the most controversial part of the political division system has been the existence of Taiwan Province, as its existence was part of a larger controversy over the political status of Taiwan. Since 1998, most of the duties and powers of Taiwan Provincial Government have been transferred to the central government, through amendments to the constitution. The much smaller Fukien province, Fujian Provincial Government has been downsized since 1956.

There has been some criticism of the current administrative scheme as being inefficient and not conducive to regional planning. In particular, most of the administrative cities are much smaller than the actual metropolitan areas, and there are no formal means for coordinating policy between an administrative city and its surrounding areas.

Before 2008, the likelihood of consolidation was low. Many of the cities had political demographics which were very different from their surrounding counties, making the prospect of consolidation highly politically charged. For example, while the Kuomintang argued that combining Taipei City, Taipei County, and Keelung City into a metropolitan Taipei region would allow for better regional planning, the Democratic Progressive Party argued that this was merely an excuse to eliminate the government of Taipei County, which it had at times controlled, by swamping it with votes from Taipei City and Keelung City, which tended to vote Kuomintang.

On 1 October 2007, Taipei County was upgraded to a quasi-municipality () on the same level as Kaohsiung City and Taipei City. This allowed the county to have the organizational and budgetary framework of a &quot;de jure&quot; municipality, but it was still formally styled as a county. Taichung County and Tainan City lobbied the central government for similar status. Taoyuan County was also upgraded to a quasi-municipality on 1 January 2011, as its population was above 2 million on the date of elevation.

Under President Ma Ying-jeou&#x27;s administration, the central government has reorganized more counties and cities. Four mergers and promotions were approved in 2009 and became effective on 25 December 2010 and one more became effective on 25 December 2014.

The summary of changes on administrative divisions are shown below.

This brought the top-level divisions of Taiwan (ROC) to its current state: 2 nominal provinces without administrative function and 6 special municipalities; and under the provinces, 13 counties and three cities.

== Current system ==
===Special municipalities, counties, and cities ===

Currently there are three types and in total 22 administrative divisions are directly governed by the central government (Executive Yuan). According to the &quot;Local Government Act&quot; of Taiwan, a place with population more than 1.25 million may become a special municipality, a place with population between 0.5 and 1.25 million may become a city. Counties with population more than 2 million may grant some extra privileges in local autonomy that was designed for special municipalities.

These 22 divisions are also regulated by the &quot;Local Government Act&quot; as local self-governance bodies. Each division has its own executive called &quot;city/county government&quot; and own legislature called &quot;city/county council&quot;. The city mayors, county magistrates and all legislators are elected by the people under its jurisdiction every four years. Geographically, 
* Six special municipalities, three provincial cities, and ten counties are on the main island of Taiwan

* Penghu County administers the Penghu Islands.
* Kinmen County administers the Kinmen Islands and the Wuqiu Islands.
* Lienchiang County administers the Matsu Islands.
* Kaohsiung also administers Pratas Island (Tungsha Island or Dongsha Island) and Taiping Island of the South China Sea Islands.

===Townships, county-administered cities and districts===
The 22 main divisions in the country are further divided into 368 subdivisions. These 368 divisions can be categorized as the following.
According to the &quot;Local Government Act&quot;, a county is divided into townships and county-administered cities. The county seat or place with population between 100,000 and 500,000 may become a county-administered city. A special municipality or a city is divided into districts.

The townships, county-administered cities in counties, and mountain indigenous district in special municipalities are also local self-governance bodies. Each division has its own executive called &quot;township/city/district office&quot; and own legislature called &quot;township/city/district council&quot;. The city mayors, township/district chiefs and all legislators are elected by the people under its jurisdiction every four years. The normal districts in special municipalities and cities are governed as branches of the municipality/city government and do not hold any local self-governance power.

The mountain indigenous township and districts are created for its significant population of Taiwanese indigenous peoples, in these divisions, only Taiwanese indigenous peoples may be elected to be the township/district chiefs.

===Lower-level administrative divisions===

The 368 divisions are further divided into villages and neighborhoods.
The village chiefs are elected by the people under its jurisdiction every four years. The neighborhood chiefs are appointed by the village chief.

== Other issues ==
===Joint Service Centers of Executive Yuan===
The central government operates five regional Joint Service Centers (JSC, ) outside Taipei as outposts of the government ministries in the Executive Yuan, similar to the cross-departmental mode of working in the former Government Offices in England. These regions, laid out the Comprehensive National Spatial Development Plan for Taiwan (), can be considered a de facto level of government, perhaps equivalent to the English regions or the federal districts of Russia.

The divisions of northern Taiwan are not covered by any JSC, including Hsinchu (city and county), Keelung, New Taipei, Taipei, Taoyuan and Yilan. They are served directly by the headquarter of Executive Yuan in Taipei.

=== Romanization ===
The romanization used for Taiwanese placenames above the county level is a modified form of Wade–Giles, ignoring the apostrophes and hyphens of the original, thus yielding &quot;Taipei&quot; instead of &quot;T&#x27;ai-pei&quot; and &quot;Yilan&quot; instead of &quot;I-lan&quot;, for example. Some postal romanizations also exist, like &quot;Keelung&quot; and &quot;Kinmen&quot;.
In 2002, the ROC adopted Tongyong Pinyin as its national standard for romanization. Most townships and county-administered cities changed their romanization to Tongyong Pinyin at that time. However, some local administrations, like Taipei and Taichung, decided to use Hanyu Pinyin. In 2009, Tongyong Pinyin was replaced by Hanyu Pinyin as the ROC government standard. Currently, most of the divisions are romanized by Hanyu Pinyin system, but some local governments still use Tongyong Pinyin, like Kaohsiung. In 2011, the ROC Ministry of the Interior restored historical romanizations for two towns, Lukang and Tamsui.

<doc id="165422" wikidata="Q21684437" url="?curid=165422" title="Rumba">
<text>The term rumba may refer to a variety of unrelated music styles. Originally, &quot;rumba&quot; was used as a synonym for &quot;party&quot; in northern Cuba, and by the late 19th century it was used to denote the complex of secular music styles known as Cuban rumba. Since the early 20th century the term has been used in different countries to refer to distinct styles of music and dance, most of which are only tangentially related to the original Cuban rumba, if at all. The vague etymological origin of the term rumba, as well as its interchangeable use with guaracha in settings such as bufo theatre, is largely responsible for such worldwide polysemy of the term. In addition, &quot;rumba&quot; was the primary marketing term for Cuban music in North America, as well as West and Central Africa, during much of the 20th century, before the rise of mambo, pachanga and salsa.

&quot;Rumba&quot; entered the English lexicon in the early 20th century, at least as early as 1919, and by 1935 it was used as a verb to denote the ballroom dance. In this sense, the anglicised spelling &quot;rhumba&quot; became prevalent and is now recommended to distinguish it from traditional Cuban rumba. Also in the first third of the 20th century, &quot;rumba&quot; entered the Spanish flamenco world as a fast-paced &quot;palo&quot; (style) inspired in the Cuban guaracha, and which gave rise to other forms of urban music now known as &quot;rumba&quot;. Throughout Latin America, &quot;rumba&quot; acquired different connotations, mostly referring to Cubanized, danceable, local styles, such as Colombian &quot;rumba criolla&quot; (creole rumba). At the same time, &quot;rumba&quot; began to be used a catch-all term for Afro-Cuban music in most African countries, later giving rise to re-Africanized Cuban-based styles such as Congolese rumba.

==In Cuba==
During the second half of the 19th century, several secular dance-oriented music styles were developed by Afro-Cuban workers in the poor neighbourhoods of Havana and Matanzas. These syncretic styles would later be referred to as &quot;rumba&quot;, a word that also meant &quot;party&quot;. Traditionally, the three main styles of rumba are yambú, columbia and guaguancó, each of which has a characteristic dance, rhythm and singing. Although still a purely folkloric genre, numerous innovations have been introduced in rumba since the mid 20th century, including new styles such as batá-rumba and guarapachangueo.

==In North America==
In the US, the term &quot;rhumba&quot; (anglicised version of rumba) began to be used during the 1920s to refer to ballroom music with Afro-Cuban music themes, particularly in the context of big band music. This music was mostly inspired by son cubano, while being rhythmically and instrumentally unrelated to Cuban rumba. By 1935, with the release of &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot; by Don Azpiazú and the popularity of Xavier Cugat and other Latin artists, the genre had become highly successful and well-defined. The rhumba dance that developed on the East Coast of the United States was based on the bolero-son. The first rumba competition took place in the Savoy Ballroom in 1930. Nowadays, two different styles of ballroom rumba coexist: American style and International style.
From 1935 to the 1950s, the Mexican and American film industry expanded the use of the term rumba as rumbera films became popular. In this context, &quot;rumberas&quot; were Cuban and Mexican divas, singers and actresses who sang boleros and canciones, but rarely rumbas. Notable &quot;rumberas&quot; include Rita Montaner, Rosa Carmina, María Antonieta Pons and Ninón Sevilla.

In the 1970s, with the emergence of salsa as a popular music and dance genre in the US, rhythmic elements of Cuban rumba (particularly guaguancó) became prevalent alongside the son. Like salsa, rhumba would then be danced to salsa ensembles instead of big bands. By the end of the 20th century, rhumba was also danced to pop music and jazz bands as seen in TV shows like &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

==In Spain==
In Spain, the term rumba was introduced in the early 20th century as rumba flamenca, one of the &quot;palos&quot; (styles) of flamenco. Particularly, it is considered one of the &quot;cantes de ida y vuelta&quot;, since flamenco itself might have had an influence on Cuban rumba, particularly on its vocal style. However, musicologists agree that rumba flamenca does not truly derive from Cuban rumba, but from guaracha, a fast-paced music style from Havana. Apart from rumba flamenca, other syncretic styles of Afro-Cuban origin have been named &quot;rumba&quot; throughout the Iberian peninsula, outside of the context of flamenco (where the term &quot;cantes de ida y vuelta&quot; is mostly restricted), such as the Galician rumba.

In the late 1950s, popular artists such as Peret (&quot;El Rey de la Rumba&quot;) and El Pescaílla developed an uptempo style that combined elements from rumba flamenca, Spanish gypsy music and pop. This became known as Catalan rumba (&quot;rumba catalana&quot;). In the 1980s, the style gained international popularity thanks to French ensemble Gipsy Kings.

In the 1990s, the term “tecno-rumba” was used to describe the music of Camela, and later Azúcar Moreno. Since the early 2000s, the term rumba has been used in Spain to refer to derivatives of Catalan rumba with hip hop and rock elements, as recorded by Estopa, Huecco and Melendi.

==In Colombia==

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, a fusion of bambuco and Afro-Cuban music was developed in Colombia by artists such as Emilio Sierra, Milciades Garavito, and Diógenes Chaves Pinzón, under the name &quot;rumba criolla&quot; (&quot;creole rumba&quot;). Rumba criolla is classified into different regional styles such as rumba antioqueña and rumba tolimense.

==In Africa==
In the 1930s and 1940s, Afro-Cuban son groups such as Septeto Habanero, Trio Matamoros and Los Guaracheros de Oriente were played over Radio Congo Belge in Léopoldville (Kinshasa), gaining widespread popularity in the country during the following decades. Their recordings were also made available to the public as part of the G.V. Series of 10&quot; singles released by the British record label, His Master&#x27;s Voice throughout Africa. Once local bands tried to emulate the sound of Cuban son (incorrectly referred to as &quot;rumba&quot; in Africa, despite being unrelated to Cuban rumba), their music became known as Congolese rumba or rumba Lingala. By the late 1960s, Congolese rumba was an established genre in most of Central Africa, and it would also impact the music of West and East Africa under Muziki wa dansi. Franco&#x27;s OK Jazz and Le Grand Kallé&#x27;s African Jazz were amongst the most successful Congolese rumba ensembles of the 20th century. A faster subgenre known as soukous (from the French word &quot;secouer&quot;, &quot;to shake&quot;) was developed in the late 1960s by bands such as African Fiesta and is often used as a synonym of the former.

<text>Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food compounds into small water-soluble components so that they can be absorbed into the blood plasma. In certain organisms, these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream. Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion. The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes. Mechanical digestion takes place in the mouth through mastication and in the small intestine through segmentation contractions. In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small compounds that the body can use.

In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food. The saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food; the electrolyte hydrogencarbonate (), which provides the ideal conditions of pH for amylase to work; and other electrolytes (, , ). About 30% of starch is hydrolyzed into disaccharide in the oral cavity (mouth). After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. In infants and toddlers, gastric juice also contains rennin to digest milk proteins. As the first two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus and bicarbonates are secreted by the stomach. They provide a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of chemicals like concentrated hydrochloric acid while also aiding lubrication. Hydrochloric acid provides acidic pH for pepsin. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes. Pepsin breaks down proteins into peptides or proteoses, which is further broken down into dipeptides and amino acids by enzymes in the small intestine. Studies suggest that increasing the number of chews per bite increases relevant gut hormones and may decrease self-reported hunger and food intake.

When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, partially digested food (chyme) enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic (about 5.6 ~ 6.9). Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Absorption of water, simple sugar and alcohol also takes place in stomach. Waste material (feces) is eliminated from the rectum during defecation.

==Digestive system==

Digestive systems take many forms. There is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it. In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, and some of the products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled.

Some organisms, including nearly all spiders, secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals (e.g., enzymes) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent &quot;soup&quot;. In others, once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism, digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure, through a tube, or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient.

===Secretion systems===
Bacteria use several systems to obtain nutrients from other organisms in the environments.

====Channel transport system====

In a channel transport system, several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria. It is a simple system, which consists of only three protein subunits: the ABC protein, membrane fusion protein (MFP), and outer membrane protein. This secretion system transports various chemical species, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20–900 kDa). The chemical species secreted vary in size from the small &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa.

====Molecular syringe====

A type III secretion system means that a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Shigella&quot;, &quot;Yersinia&quot;) can inject nutrients into protist cells. One such mechanism was first discovered in &quot;Y. pestis&quot; and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host&#x27;s cells rather than be secreted into the extracellular medium.

====Conjugation machinery====
The conjugation machinery of some bacteria (and archaeal flagella) is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;, which uses this system to introduce the Ti plasmid and proteins into the host, which develops the crown gall (tumor). The VirB complex of &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; is the prototypic system.

In the nitrogen-fixing &quot;Rhizobia&quot;, conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation. Such elements as the &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.

The Ti and Ri plasmids are themselves conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the &quot;tra&quot;, or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the &quot;vir&quot;, or virulence, operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent &quot;Agrobacteria&quot;.

====Release of outer membrane vesicles====
In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles. Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials. Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells. While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.

===Gastrovascular cavity===
The gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body. Extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity, which is lined with the gastrodermis, the internal layer of epithelium. This cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus: waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus, which can be described as an incomplete gut.

In a plant such as the Venus flytrap that can make its own food through photosynthesis, it does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional objectives of harvesting energy and carbon, but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus in particular) that are in short supply in its boggy, acidic habitat.

===Phagosome===
A phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis. The vacuole is formed by the fusion of the cell membrane around the particle. A phagosome is a cellular compartment in which pathogenic microorganisms can be killed and digested. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process, forming phagolysosomes. In humans, &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; can phagocytose red blood cells.

===Specialised organs and behaviours===
To aid in the digestion of their food, animals evolved organs such as beaks, tongues, radulae, teeth, crops, gizzards, and others.

====Beaks====
Birds have bony beaks that are specialised according to the bird&#x27;s ecological niche. For example, macaws primarily eat seeds, nuts, and fruit, using their beaks to open even the toughest seed. First they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak, then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak.

The mouth of the squid is equipped with a sharp horny beak mainly made of cross-linked proteins. It is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain any minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species. The beak is the only indigestible part of the squid.

====Tongue====

The tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates, that manipulates food for chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition). It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva. The underside of the tongue is covered with a smooth mucous membrane. The tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing. The tongue is used to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis.

The sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the oral mucosa is very thin, and underlain by a plexus of veins. This is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

====Teeth====

Teeth (singular tooth) are small whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.

The shapes, sizes and numbers of types of animals&#x27; teeth are related to their diets. For example, herbivores have a number of molars which are used to grind plant matter, which is difficult to digest. Carnivores have canine teeth which are used to kill and tear meat.

====Crop====
A crop, or croup, is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds.

Certain insects may have a crop or enlarged esophagus.

====Abomasum====
Herbivores have evolved cecums (or an abomasum in the case of ruminants). Ruminants have a fore-stomach with four chambers. These are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud (or bolus). The cud is then regurgitated, chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size.

Fibre, especially cellulose and hemi-cellulose, is primarily broken down into the volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in these chambers (the reticulo-rumen) by microbes: (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi). In the omasum, water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream.

The abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here in much the same way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine. Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.

====Specialised behaviours====
Regurgitation has been mentioned above under abomasum and crop, referring to crop milk, a secretion from the lining of the crop of pigeons and doves with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation.

Many sharks have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out and evert it out of their mouths in order to get rid of unwanted contents (perhaps developed as a way to reduce exposure to toxins).

Other animals, such as rabbits and rodents, practise coprophagia behaviours – eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage. Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.

Young elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the faeces of their mother, probably to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile). Without them, they would be unable to get any nutritional value from many plant components.

===In earthworms===
An earthworm&#x27;s digestive system consists of a mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.

==Overview of vertebrate digestion==

In most vertebrates, digestion is a multistage process in the digestive system, starting from ingestion of raw materials, most often other organisms. Ingestion usually involves some type of mechanical and chemical processing. Digestion is separated into four steps:
# Ingestion: placing food into the mouth (entry of food in the digestive system),
# Mechanical and chemical breakdown: mastication and the mixing of the resulting bolus with water, acids, bile and enzymes in the stomach and intestine to break down complex chemical species into simple structures,
# Absorption: of nutrients from the digestive system to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries through osmosis, active transport, and diffusion, and
# Egestion (Excretion): Removal of undigested materials from the digestive tract through defecation.

Underlying the process is muscle movement throughout the system through swallowing and peristalsis. Each step in digestion requires energy, and thus imposes an &quot;overhead charge&quot; on the energy made available from absorbed substances. Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle, behavior, and even physical structures. Examples may be seen in humans, who differ considerably from other hominids (lack of hair, smaller jaws and musculature, different dentition, length of intestines, cooking, etc.).

The major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine. The large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digests before excretion.

In mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach. Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed, and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches. The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes. Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, and the process finishes with defecation.

==Human digestion process==

The human gastrointestinal tract is around long. Food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal, and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours.

Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which could damage the stomach lining, but mucus and bicarbonates are secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. Mainly proteins are digested in stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells are covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine. Bile helps in emulsification of fats and also activates lipases.

In the large intestine, the passage of food is slower to enable fermentation by the gut flora to take place. Here, water is absorbed and waste material stored as feces to be removed by defecation via the anal canal and anus.

=== Neural and biochemical control mechanisms ===
Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase.

The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin.

The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid, which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1–3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.

The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.

==Breakdown into nutrients==
===Protein digestion===
Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids. The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the zymogens. For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin. Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides.

===Fat digestion=== 

Digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides. However fats are mainly digested in the small intestine. The presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of pancreatic lipase from the pancreas and bile from the liver which helps in the emulsification of fats for absorption of fatty acids. Complete digestion of one molecule of fat (a triglyceride) results a mixture of fatty acids, mono- and di-glycerides, but no glycerol.

===Carbohydrate digestion===

In humans, dietary starches are composed of glucose units arranged in long chains called amylose, a polysaccharide. During digestion, bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase, resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose. This results in simple sugars glucose and maltose (2 glucose molecules) that can be absorbed by the small intestine.

Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts, glucose and galactose. Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine. Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods. This is commonly known as lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance varies widely by genetic heritage; more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant, in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent.

Sucrase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, cane sugar, or beet sugar. Sucrose digestion yields the sugars fructose and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine.

===DNA and RNA digestion===

DNA and RNA are broken down into mononucleotides by the nucleases deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease (DNase and RNase) from the pancreas.

==Non-destructive digestion==
Some nutrients are complex molecules (for example vitamin B12) which would be destroyed if they were broken down into their functional groups. To digest vitamin B12 non-destructively, haptocorrin in saliva strongly binds and protects the B12 molecules from stomach acid as they enter the stomach and are cleaved from their protein complexes.

After the B12-haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum, pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the B12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor (IF). These B12-IF complexes travel to the ileum portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of B12-IF complexes in the blood.

==Digestive hormones==

There are at least five hormones that aid and regulate the digestive system in mammals. There are variations across the vertebrates, as for instance in birds. Arrangements are complex and additional details are regularly discovered. Connections to metabolic control (largely the glucose-insulin system) have been uncovered.
* Gastrin – is in the stomach and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete pepsinogen (an inactive form of the enzyme pepsin) and hydrochloric acid. Secretion of gastrin is stimulated by food arriving in stomach. The secretion is inhibited by low pH.
* Secretin – is in the duodenum and signals the secretion of sodium bicarbonate in the pancreas and it stimulates the bile secretion in the liver. This hormone responds to the acidity of the chyme.
* Cholecystokinin (CCK) – is in the duodenum and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and stimulates the emptying of bile in the gall bladder. This hormone is secreted in response to fat in chyme.
* Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) – is in the duodenum and decreases the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach. Another function is to induce insulin secretion.
* Motilin – is in the duodenum and increases the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulates the production of pepsin.

==Significance of pH==

Digestion is a complex process controlled by several factors. pH plays a crucial role in a normally functioning digestive tract. In the mouth, pharynx and esophagus, pH is typically about 6.8, very weakly acidic. Saliva controls pH in this region of the digestive tract. Salivary amylase is contained in saliva and starts the breakdown of carbohydrates into monosaccharides. Most digestive enzymes are sensitive to pH and will denature in a high or low pH environment.

The stomach&#x27;s high acidity inhibits the breakdown of carbohydrates within it. This acidity confers two benefits: it denatures proteins for further digestion in the small intestines, and provides non-specific immunity, damaging or eliminating various pathogens.

In the small intestines, the duodenum provides critical pH balancing to activate digestive enzymes. The liver secretes bile into the duodenum to neutralize the acidic conditions from the stomach, and the pancreatic duct empties into the duodenum, adding bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme, thus creating a neutral environment. The mucosal tissue of the small intestines is alkaline with a pH of about 8.5.

<text>William Rose Benét (February 2, 1886 – May 4, 1950) was an American poet, writer, and editor. He was the older brother of Stephen Vincent Benét.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Col. James Walker Benét and his wife, Frances Neill (née Rose), and grandson of Brigadier General Stephen Vincent Benét. He was educated The Albany Academy in Albany, NY and at Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, graduating with a Ph.B. in 1907. At Yale, he edited and contributed light verse to campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot;. 

Benét came to California in 1909 where his father was stationed as a commander of the Benicia Arsenal in Benicia. He arrived at the Carmel-by-the-Sea writers&#x27; colony and stayed with, roommate and friend, Sinclair Lewis. Lewis and Benét left Carmel after six months.

==Career==
He began the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot; in 1924 and continued to edit and write for it until his death.

In 1942, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his book of autobiographical verse, &quot;The Dust Which Is God&quot; (1941). His brother Stephen Vincent Benét was awarded the same prize two years later in 1944.

Benét is also the author of &quot;The Reader&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;, a standard American guide to world literature.

Today he is perhaps best known as the author of &quot;The Skater of Ghost Lake,&quot; a poem frequently assigned in American schools for its use of onomatopoeia and rhythm as well as its tone of dark mystery.

==Personal life==
Benét married four times. First, on September 3, 1912, he married Teresa Frances Thompson, with whom he had three children (James Walker Benét (1914-2012), Frances Rosemary Benét, and Kathleen Anne Benét). Teresa died in 1919.
Benét&#x27;s second wife, whom he married on October 5, 1923, was poet Elinor Wylie. She died in 1928.
Benét&#x27;s third wife, whom he married on March 15, 1932, was Lora Baxter. They divorced in 1937. 
Benét&#x27;s fourth wife, and widow, was children&#x27;s writer Marjorie Flack. They were married from June 22, 1941, until his death in 1950.

Benét&#x27;s son, James Walker Benét, fought in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and was the author of two suspense novels and a guidebook to the San Francisco Bay Area.

<text>Viennese waltz () is a genre of ballroom dance. At least four different meanings are recognized. In the historically first sense, the name may refer to several versions of the waltz, including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing, danced to the music of Viennese waltz.

What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz. It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or &quot;waltz&quot; position. The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz, danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar (the international standard of 30 measures per minute), while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats (58-60 measures) per minute. To this day however, in Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, and France, the words (German), (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), and (French) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz.

The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader&#x27;s right (natural) or toward the leader&#x27;s left (reverse), interspersed with non-rotating &quot;change steps&quot; to switch between the direction of rotation.

As the waltz evolved, some of the versions that were done at about the original fast tempo came to be called specifically &quot;Viennese waltz&quot; to distinguish them from the slower waltzes. In the modern ballroom dance, two versions of Viennese waltz are recognized: International Style and American Style.

Today the Viennese waltz is a ballroom and partner dance that is part of the International Standard division of contemporary ballroom dance. The Waltz Series is a New York membership society devoted to preserving the pre-World War I tradition of Viennese waltz. It organizes a program of dances.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The Viennese waltz, so called to distinguish it from the waltz and the French waltz, is the oldest of the current ballroom dances. It emerged in the second half of the 18th century from the German dance and the Ländler in Austria and was both popular and subject to criticism. At that time, the waltz, as described in a magazine from 1799, was performed by dancers who held on to their long gowns to prevent them from dragging or being stepped on. The dancers would lift their dresses and hold them high like cloaks, and this would bring both their bodies under one cover. This action also required the dancers&#x27; bodies to be very close together, and this closeness attracted moral disparagement. In 1797, Wolf published a pamphlet against the dance entitled &quot;Proof that Waltzing is the Main Source of Weakness of the Body and Mind of our Generation&quot;. But even when faced with all this negativity, it became very popular in Vienna. Large dance halls like the Zum Sperl in 1807 and the Apollo in 1808 were opened to provide space for thousands of dancers. The dance reached and spread to England sometime before 1812. It was introduced as the German waltz and became a huge hit. It gained ground through the Congress of Vienna at the beginning of the 19th century and by the famous compositions by Josef Lanner, Johann Strauss I and his son, Johann Strauss II, and since then has been known as the Viennese waltz.

Initially, the waltz was significantly different from its form today. In the first place, the couples did not dance in the closed position as today. The illustrations and descriptions make it clear that the couples danced with arm positions similar to that of the precursor dances, the Ländler and the Allemande. The hold was at times semi-closed and at times side by side. Arms were intertwined and circling movements were made under raised arms. No couple in Wilson&#x27;s plate are shown in close embrace, but some are in closed hold facing each other. Another significant difference from the present technique was that the feet were turned out and the rise of foot during the dance was much more pronounced. This can be seen quite clearly in the figure, and such a style imposes its limitations on how the dance can be performed.

To understand why Quirey says &quot;The advent of the in polite society was quite simply the greatest change in dance form and dancing manners that has happened in our history&quot; we need to realize that all European social dances before the waltz were communal sequence dances – communal, because all the dancers on the floor took part in a preset pattern (often chosen by a master of ceremony). Dancers separately, and as couples, faced outwards to the spectators as much as they faced inwards. Thus all present took part as dancers or as onlookers. This was the way with the country dance and all previous popular dances. With the waltz, couples were independent of each other and were turned towards each other (though not in close contact). Lord Byron wrote a furious letter, which precedes his poem &quot;The Waltz&quot;, in which he decries the anti-social nature of the dance, with the couple &quot;like two cockchafers spitted on the same bodkin.&quot;

== Technique and styles ==
The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either in a clockwise (&quot;natural&quot;) or counter-clockwise (&quot;reverse&quot;) direction interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation. A true Viennese waltz consists only of turns and change steps. Other moves such as the fleckerls, American-style figures and side sway or underarm turns are modern inventions.

The competitive styles of Viennese waltz has a reduced number of steps, depending on the style and competition level or medal exam level.

=== International-style Viennese waltz ===
International-style Viennese waltz is danced in closed position. The syllabus is limited to natural and reverse turns, closed and open changes, fleckerls, contra check, left whisk, and canter-time pivot turns (canter pivots).

In World Dance Council competition, canter pivots are excluded.

=== American-style Viennese waltz ===
American-style Viennese waltz has much more freedom, both in dance positions and syllabus.

<text>Willows High School () is a secondary school located in the Tremorfa area of Cardiff, Wales. It caters for pupils aged 11 to 16 and is English-medium. As of September 2015, the headteacher is Chris Norman. He succeeded Joy Ballard, under whom the proportion of pupils attaining five A*-C grades rose from 14% to 50%. In recent years, Willows has been oversubscribed for pupils.

== History ==
The school site is extensive and dates from the late 1960s, and was built on the site of the World War II airfield RAF Pengam Moors. The school is named after the air balloon pioneer Ernest Willows who had his airfield on the site.

Many of the buildings have since been modernised. There are plans to continue this modernisation in the future, including with a PFI agreement as part of plans by Cardiff Council. A completely new building is planned, which could be located in nearby Tremorfa Park. The site proposed originally included St. Alban&#x27;s Primary School, which was slated to close. However, in 2019 the closure was successfully petitioned, and stopped in 2020.

The school featured in the 2015 Channel 4 documentary series &quot;Educating Cardiff&quot;. This detailed every aspect of school life, and also highlighted many of the improvements the school has made in recent years.

Starting in 2015, Willows participated in the South Wales Challenge (SWC) Initiative, sharing best-practice in education with Tonyrefail School, Rhondda Cynon Taf. This aimed to help the school to improve academic standards further.

==Estyn Inspections==
In 2012, Estyn rated the school as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, reporting that it needed &quot;significant improvement&quot;. The inspectors reported that, although pupils often had unsatisfactory English grammar and literacy skills, leadership was &quot;adequate&quot; and there were real prospects of improvement. The school substantially improved after this, and by 2014 no longer requires significant improvement. However, the more recent 2018 has found there are still many aspects of school life that could be improved, particularly in the methods of teaching and leadership. Despite this, the school had improved enough that in 2019 it was removed from monitoring by Estyn.

There were 586 pupils at the school during the 2018 Estyn inspection, a significant drop since the 2012 inspection. The proportion of pupils receiving free school meals is 44%, which is much higher than the national average of 17.4%. Almost two-thirds of the pupils live in the 20% most deprived areas in Wales. Around 8% of pupils have English as an additional language. Twenty-nine per cent of the pupils come from minority ethnic backgrounds.

==Former students==
Notable former students include Jessica Leigh Jones.

<doc id="165431" wikidata="Q914489" url="?curid=165431" title="Magma (band)">
<text>Magma is a French progressive rock band founded in Paris in 1969 by self-taught drummer Christian Vander, who claimed as his inspiration a &quot;vision of humanity&#x27;s spiritual and ecological future&quot; that profoundly disturbed him. The style of progressive rock that Vander developed with Magma is termed &quot;Zeuhl&quot;, and has been applied to other bands in France operating in the same period, and to some recent Japanese bands.

Vander created a fictional language, Kobaïan, in which most lyrics are sung. In a 1977 interview with Vander and long-time Magma vocalist Klaus Blasquiz, Blasquiz said that Kobaïan is a &quot;phonetic language made by elements of the Slavonic and Germanic languages to be able to express some things musically. The language has of course a content, but not word by word.&quot; Vander himself has said, &quot;When I wrote, the sounds [of Kobaïan] came naturally with it—I didn&#x27;t intellectualise the process by saying &#x27;Ok, now I&#x27;m going to write some words in a particular language&#x27;, it was really sounds that were coming at the same time as the music.&quot; In the course of their first album, the band tells the story of a group of people fleeing a doomed Earth to settle on the planet Kobaïa. Subsequently, conflict arises when the Kobaïans - descendants of the original colonists - encounter other Earth refugees. Later albums tell different stories set in more ancient times; however, the Kobaïan language remains an integral part of the music.

In 1986, the French label Seventh Records was founded to (re-)publish Magma&#x27;s and Vander&#x27;s work. Over the years, Seventh has also released albums by related artists such as Stella Vander, Patrick Gauthier, and Collectif Mu.

== History ==

=== Beginnings (1967–1971) ===
In early 1967, drummer Christian Vander played in the Wurdalaks and Cruciferius Lobonz, two rhythm and blues bands. With these groups, he wrote his first compositions, &quot;Nogma&quot; and &quot;Atumba&quot;. The death of John Coltrane saddened Vander, who left the groups and traveled to Italy. He returned to France in 1969 and met saxophonist René Garber and bassist and conductor Laurent Thibault. Together with singer Lucien Zabuski and organist Francis Moze, they created the group Uniweria Zekt Magma Composedra Arguezdra, shortened to Magma.

After their first tour, Magma experienced significant lineup turnover. Vocalist Lucien Zabuski was replaced with Klaus Blasquiz, and pianist Eddie Rabin, double bassist Jacky Vidal, and guitarist Claude Engel also joined the group. The group worked on material for three months in a house in the Chevreuse Valley. Eddie Rabin was replaced by François Cahen on keyboards, and Laurent Thibault abandoned bass to devote himself to production. Francis Moze became the new bassist. The band also expanded with a brass section, consisting of Teddy Lasry on saxophone and clarinet, Richard Raux on saxophone and flute, and Paco Charlery on trumpet. The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Magma&quot;, was released in the spring of 1970 by Philips Records. The group caused a sensation but audience reactions were mixed.

After the album was released, Claude Engel, Richard Raux, and Paco Charlery left the group. Jeff Seffer replaced Raux on saxophone, and Louis Toesca replaced Charlery on trumpet. Their second album, &quot;1001° Centigrades&quot;, was released in April 1971. The album won the band more exposure, including a performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival.

=== &quot;Mëkanïk Dëstruktïẁ Kömmandöh,&quot; to &quot;Üdü Wüdü&quot; (1972–1977) ===
In August 1972, Magma released the album &quot;The Unnamables&quot;, under the alias Univeria Zekt. However, the album sold only 1,500 copies. Many musicians left the band that year, including François Cahen, Louis Toesca, Jeff Seffer, Francis Moze, and Teddy Lasry. That same year, Christian Vander recorded the soundtrack for Yvan Lagrange&#x27;s film &quot;Tristan et Iseult.&quot;

In 1973, Vander formed a new lineup of the band, adding Stella Vander as a second vocalist, Claude Olmos on guitar, Jannick Top replacing Francis Moze on bass, René Garber on saxophone and clarinet, and Jean-Luc Manderlier on keyboards, among others. This new version of the band would release their most famous work &quot;Mëkanïk Dëstruktïẁ Kömmandöh,&quot; which would later become their most acclaimed album, and gave them international fame, including a spot at the prestigious Newport Jazz Festival, their first American performance. In 1974, under Vander&#x27;s name, the band released a soundtrack album accompanying Yvan Lagrange&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Tristan et Iseult&quot;, also known as &quot;Ẁurdah Ïtah&quot;; under Magma&#x27;s name, they followed up with &quot;Köhntarkösz&quot;, which was successful among fans, but not received as well among the public as &quot;Mëkanïk Dëstruktïẁ Kömmandöh&quot;. The band would then go on a long, year-and-a-half long tour of France, and after another member shakeup (Bernard Paganotti replacing Jannick Top on bass, Didier Lockwood added as a violinist, Jean-Pol Asseline and Benot Widemann replacing Gerard Bikialo on keyboards, and Gabriel Federow replacing Claude Olmos on guitar), released their first live album, &quot;Live / Hhaï&quot;, in December 1975, recorded at the Taverne de l&#x27;Olympia in Paris.

In 1976, Top briefly rejoined the band for the recording of the album &quot;Üdü Ẁüdü&quot;, but left soon after due to strained relations with frontman Christian Vander. More lineup turnover followed in 1977, with Jean DeAntoni replacing Gabriel Federow on guitar, Guy Delacroix replacing Bernard Paganotti on bass, and Clement Bailly hired as a second drummer.

=== Changing sound and breakup (1978–1984) ===
In 1978, Magma released the album &quot;Attahk&quot;. Vying for more commercial success, the album included elements of soul, rhythm &amp; blues, and funk music.

Celebrating 10 years as a band, in 1980, Magma performed three nights at L&#x27;Olympia in Paris, with guest appearances from many of the group&#x27;s past musicians. These were recorded and released as &quot;Retrospektïẁ (Parts I+II)&quot; and &quot;Retrospektïẁ (Part III)&quot;. The concerts were successful, and allowed Magma to play a number of shows around France, including a three-week residency at Paris&#x27;s Bobino in 1981, which was recorded and filmed, and later released as &quot;Concert Bobino 1981&quot;.

In 1984, the band recorded the album &quot;Merci&quot;, and disbanded shortly afterwards. Christian Vander formed other projects such as Offering, and various jazz projects including the Christian Vander Trio.

=== Reformation (1996–present) ===
While performing as Offering, Vander would occasionally perform Magma songs. In 1989, professional snooker champion Steve Davis convinced Vander to perform a reunion tour (at least six shows) which led Vander to consider reuniting Magma.

After the dissolution of Offering, this was fully realised in 1996 after friend Bernard Ivan asked Vander if he was considering reviving Magma, as he was confident he could get Vander concert dates. Vander agreed, but confessed that he didn&#x27;t think there would be any remaining interest in the band. Ivan came back to Vander to tell him he fully booked a number of gigs for Magma and Vander, surprised, quickly cobbled a lineup from Offering and friends in the music scene to create a new 14-piece Magma.

Vander decided to revive some sections of tracks he had written back in 1972-1973 while working on &quot;Köhntarkösz&quot; on this new tour. Eventually, these merged into one big composition &quot;K.A (Köhntarkösz Anteria)&quot;, which released in 2004 to acclaim and surprise at their comeback. &quot;K.A&quot; is conceptually the prequel to &quot;Köhntarkösz&quot;, which was then followed up by a sequel &quot;Ëmëhntëhtt-Ré&quot; in 2009, ending a narrative trilogy between the three albums.

On 30 September 2022 Magma released their fifteenth album &quot;Kartëhl&quot;. The album is a collective work of the band members. The copyright proceeds of the track &quot;Dëhndë&quot; will be donated to a charity for people with autism.

Magma still tour today.

==Kobaïan==
Kobaïan is a lyrical language created by Christian Vander for Magma. It is the language of Kobaïa, a fictional planet invented by Vander and the setting for a musical &quot;space opera&quot; sung in Kobaïan by Magma on fifteen concept albums.

===Development===
French drummer and composer Christian Vander formed Magma in late 1969 in an attempt to fill the void left by the death of American jazz musician and composer John Coltrane. Magma&#x27;s first album, &quot;Magma&quot; (later reissued as &quot;Kobaïa&quot;), told a story of refugees fleeing a future Earth and settling on a fictional planet called Kobaïa. The lyrics were all in Kobaïan (except the title track, sung mostly in English), a language Vander constructed for the album, some sung by soloists and others by &quot;massive quasi-operatic choruses&quot;. Over the next three decades, Magma have made fifteen albums that continues the mythology of Kobaïa, all sung in Kobaïan.

Vander (his Kobaïan name is Zëbëhn Straïn dë Ğeuštaah) said in an interview that he invented Kobaïan for Magma because &quot;French just wasn&#x27;t expressive enough. Either for the story or for the sound of the music&quot;. He said that the language developed in parallel with the music, that sounds appeared as he was composing on a piano. Vander based Kobaïan in part on elements of Slavic and Germanic languages and in part on the scat-yodeling vocal style of American avant-garde jazz singer Leon Thomas. The subsequent expansion of the language became a group effort, and as Magma&#x27;s personnel changed, so new ideas were incorporated into the language (and the music).

British music critic Ian MacDonald said that Kobaïan is &quot;phonetic, not semantic&quot;, and that it is based on &quot;sonorities, not on applied meanings&quot;. One of Magma&#x27;s singers, Klaus Blasquiz, described Kobaïan as &quot;a language of the heart&quot; whose words are &quot;inseparable from the music&quot;. Magma expert Michael Draine said &quot;the abstraction provided by the Kobaïan verse seems to inspire Magma&#x27;s singers to heights of emotional abandon rarely permitted by conventional lyrics&quot;.

The Kobaïan lyrics on Magma&#x27;s albums were generally not translated (though both Kobaïan lyrics and an English translation were provided for the first UK release on A&amp;M of &quot;Mëkanïk Dëstruktïẁ Kömmandöh&quot;), but clues to the unfolding story of Kobaïa were given in French in the albums&#x27; liner notes. While the original intent of the language was to avoid over-scrutiny, unofficial Kobaïan online lexicons were created by Magma fans, and Vander himself has since translated many of the words.

===Influence===
Christian Vander called Magma&#x27;s music &quot;Zeuhl&quot; (Kobaïan for &quot;celestial&quot;), and it influenced a number of other (mostly French) bands, including Zao (France), Art Zoyd (France) and Univers Zero (Belgium). Zeuhl later became a music genre which was used to describe music similar to that of Magma. Several Japanese Zeuhl bands also sprang up, including Ruins and Kōenji Hyakkei, whose lyrics are also sung in a constructed language similar to Kobaïan.

==Style and influences==

Christian Vander has described the style of progressive rock that he developed with Magma in France from 1969 onwards as &quot;zeuhl&quot;. Dominique Leone, writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, says the style is &quot;about what you&#x27;d expect an alien rock opera to sound like: massed, chanted choral motifs, martial, repetitive percussion, sudden bursts of explosive improv and just as unexpected lapses into eerie, minimalist trance-rock.&quot; The term comes from Kobaïan, the fictional language created by Vander for Magma. He has said that it means &quot;celestial&quot;; that &quot;Zeuhl music means &#x27;vibratory music&#x27;&quot; and that zeuhl is &quot;&quot;L&#x27;esprit au travers de la matière&quot;. That is Zeuhl. Zeuhl is also the sound which you can feel vibrating in your belly. Pronounce the word Zeuhl very slowly, and stress the letter &#x27;z&#x27; at the beginning, and you will feel your body vibrating.&quot;

Originally applied solely to the music of Magma, the term &quot;zeuhl&quot; was eventually used to describe the similar music produced by French bands beginning in the 1970s. In addition to Magma, bands who are associated with the term include: Happy Family, Kōenji Hyakkei, and Ruins from Japan, and French band Zao.

The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote that Magma&#x27;s music &quot;could arguably be labeled modern classical, progressive rock, free jazz, or even psychedelia, but it’s too big for any of those boxes&quot;.

Vander was musically influenced by John Coltrane and Carl Orff.

The mythology of Kobaïa seems to be strongly influenced by the esoteric &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, a kind of pseudo-bible that combines religious elements of various origins with scientific findings and science fiction. Furthermore, the motifs surrounding the myth of Kobaïa, particularly in the first three albums, have similarities with Johannes Kepler&#x27;s novel &quot;Somnium&quot; from 1634, Francis Godwin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot; from 1638 and Cyrano de Bergerac&#x27;s &quot;The Other World&quot; (Orig. &quot;L&#x27;autre monde&quot;), whose works gained new popularity in France in the 1970s. With the album &quot;Theusz Hamthaak&quot;, the motifs increasingly approach modern science fiction literature of the 20th century such as H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s &quot;The Last and the First Men&quot; and &quot;The Star Maker&quot; of 1930 or Arthur C. Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Last Generation&quot; from 1953. However, Vander has not yet commented directly on the sources of his inspirations.

=== Legacy ===
The band is widely considered to be musically adventurous and imaginative among music critics. Magma uses choirs extensively in a way reminiscent of the composer Carl Orff. Magma&#x27;s music is also highly influenced by jazz saxophone player John Coltrane, and Vander has said that &quot;it is still Coltrane who actually gives me the real material to work on, to be able to move on&quot;.

Many of the musicians who have played with Magma have also formed solo projects or spinoff acts. The Kobaïan term Zeuhl has come to refer to the musical style of these bands and the French jazz fusion/symphonic rock scene that grew around them. Besides Christian Vander, other well-known Magma alumni include the violinist Didier Lockwood, bassist-composer Jannick &quot;Janik&quot; Top, and spinoff act Weidorje.

====Fandom====
The band has a number of high-profile fans. Punk rock singer Johnny Rotten, metal musician Kristoffer Rygg, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, Cattle Decapitation vocalist Travis Ryan, magician Penn Jillette, and Chilean filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky have all stated their admiration of the band.

In the 1980s, British World champion snooker player Steve Davis declared himself a passionate follower of the band since his youth and used some of his winnings to promote a series of concerts by Magma in London.

Television journalist Antoine de Caunes wrote a biography of the band entitled &quot;Magma&quot;.

In 2017, documentary filmmaker Laurent Goldstein directed &quot;To Life, Death and Beyond – The Music of Magma&quot;. Interviewees include Christian Vander, Stella Vander, James MacGaw, Trey Gunn, Robert Trujillo, and Jello Biafra.

<text>Kenneth Sean &quot;Ken&quot; Carson Jr. is a fashion doll introduced by American toy company Mattel in 1961 as the counterpart of Barbie, who had been introduced two years earlier.

Similar to Barbie, Ken is from Willows, Wisconsin, and has a fashionable line of clothing and accessories (although he made his debut wearing only a swimsuit). In the Barbie mythos, Ken met Barbie on the set of a TV commercial and is her boyfriend, per promotional box inscriptions from his debut until 2018. , he is perceived as one of Barbie&#x27;s main friends. Since his debut, Ken has held over 40 occupations, the latest being &quot;beach&quot; (standing in the sand and surveying the waves), as depicted in the 2023 &quot;Barbie&quot; film.

==History==
Ken was introduced as the male counterpart to Barbie by the American toy company Mattel in 1961. He was named after Kenneth Handler, son of Barbie creator/inventor Ruth Handler, just as Barbie was named after her daughter. Ken Handler died in 1994 of a brain tumor.

From 1961 to the debut of Superstar Ken in 1977, Ken had straight arms that did not bend. His head could only turn left and right. Ken&#x27;s hair was made of felt in his first year (known to collectors as the &quot;flocked&quot; hair Ken), but this was replaced with a plastic, molded hairstyle when the creators realized that the felt hair fell off when wet. Superstar Ken featured a dimpled smile, a head that could swivel, bent arms, a more muscular physique, jewelry, and underwear permanently molded to his body. Allegedly Ruth Handler built Ken&#x27;s appearance in resemblance to her husband.

In February 2004, Mattel announced a split for Ken and Barbie, with Russell Arons, vice president of marketing at Mattel, saying that Barbie and Ken &quot;feel it&#x27;s time to spend some quality time – apart...Like other celebrity couples, their Hollywood romance has come to an end&quot;, though Arons indicated that the duo would &quot;remain friends&quot;.

In February 2006, however, a revamped version of the Ken doll was launched, though it was stated that his relationship with Barbie was still purely platonic. In 2011, Mattel launched a massive campaign for Ken to win Barbie&#x27;s affections back. The pair officially reunited on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2011.

In 2011, Mattel introduced Japan Ken, the first Ken doll to be included in the &quot;Dolls of the World&quot; collection, which was formerly a Barbie-only line. The Japan Ken doll features a new face sculpt.

In 2021, Mattel announced 15 new looks for Ken. This included looks with different skin tones, body shapes and hair styles. Barbie underwent a similar makeover in 2020. Outside of this change, Ken has not changed much since he was introduced years ago.

==Notable lines==

=== Earring Magic Ken ===

In 1993, Earring Magic Ken was released. The style of the doll was thought to resemble fashions and accessories worn by some segments of the gay community at the time, and &quot;Earring Magic Ken&quot; subsequently attained a cult following, becoming a collector&#x27;s item.

=== Sugar Daddy Ken ===
In October 2009, Mattel announced a new &quot;Palm Beach&quot; line which included a &quot;Sugar Daddy Ken&quot; doll aimed for adult collectors. The said line officially debuted in the spring of 2010. The line proved to be controversial, because of Ken&#x27;s suggestive-sounding name. The doll had a more mature appearance and came with a West Highland Terrier puppy. Mattel defended the doll&#x27;s name, saying that the puppy&#x27;s name is &quot;Sugar&quot;, thus making Ken &quot;Sugar&#x27;s Daddy&quot;. The doll&#x27;s outfit resembled an outfit worn by a socialite seen in Slim Aarons&#x27; photo &quot;Palm Springs Party&quot;.

=== Other lines ===

Ken&#x27;s best friend, Allan Sherwood (Midge&#x27;s boyfriend, later husband), was introduced in 1964. In 1968 Brad, the first African American male doll, was introduced as the boyfriend of Barbie&#x27;s African American friend, Christie, who was introduced in 1967.

== Criticism ==
Ken&#x27;s body proportions have been described as unrealistic by scholarly studies (his chest is estimated to be about 27.5% too large for a representative human male). Unrealistic body proportions in Barbie dolls, including Ken&#x27;s, have been connected to some eating disorders in children. Another controversy has also centered around the visibility (or lack of it) of Ken&#x27;s male genitalia.

==Media/multimedia appearances==
Ken has starred in various roles not disclosed by Mattel in the Barbie media franchise, including the &quot;Barbie&quot; films, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Barbie: Vlogger&quot;, &quot;Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures&quot;, &quot;Barbie&#x27;s Dreamworld&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Billy Flanigan appeared as Ken in &quot;Disney’s Magical World of Barbie&quot;. René Dif appeared as Ken in the music video for Aqua&#x27;s &quot;Barbie Girl&quot;.

Ken appeared in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films from Pixar from &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; onward. In the third film, which he appeared in as one of the henchmen of the film&#x27;s villain, Lots-O&#x27;-Huggin&#x27; Bear, he was voiced by Michael Keaton.

American rapper Lil B likely named his 2017 mixtape &quot;Black Ken&quot; after Ken, as the cover art for the mixtape depicts Lil B and some of his female friends as dolls in the same style as Barbie.

Atlanta rapper Kenyatta Lee Frazier Jr., known professionally as Ken Carson, got his name from the doll as he wanted to &quot;live better than him&quot;.

In 2019, Pete Davidson and Julia Fox were a part of a photo shoot in &quot;Paper&quot; magazine, where Davidson posed as Ken and Fox posed as Barbie. The photo shoot was created for the &#x27;Break the Internet&#x27; series of the magazine, which was made popular by Kim Kardashian&#x27;s popular &quot;Champagne Incident&quot; portrait.

Various iterations of Ken appear in the 2023 live-action &quot;Barbie&quot; film, with the lead Ken (referred to as &quot;Beach Ken&quot;) played by Canadian actor Ryan Gosling, and others by diverse actors such as Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Ncuti Gatwa, Scott Evans and John Cena. Gosling received widespread critical acclaim and various accolades for his performance, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Songs inspired by Ken&#x27;s character in the movie&#x27;s soundtrack album include &quot;Man I Am&quot; by Sam Smith and &quot;I&#x27;m Just Ken&quot; by Gosling and the other Ken actors; the latter received nominations for the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Song, along with the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media 

===Names===
Ken is named after Ruth Handler’s son Kenneth. In the 1960s Random House books, the character&#x27;s surname is given as Carson. Barbie and Ken&#x27;s surnames were taken from the name of Mattel&#x27;s ad agency Carson/Roberts. Ken&#x27;s middle name is Sean.

<doc id="165439" wikidata="Q200034" url="?curid=165439" title="Pointillism">
<text>Pointillism (, ) is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image.

Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism. The term &quot;Pointillism&quot; was coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, but is now used without its earlier pejorative connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-impressionism. The Divisionists used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes.

== Technique ==
The technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to Divisionism, a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint. It is a technique with few serious practitioners today and is notably seen in the works of Seurat, Signac, and Cross.


From 1905 to 1907, Robert Delaunay and Jean Metzinger painted in a Divisionist style with large squares or &#x27;cubes&#x27; of color: the size and direction of each gave a sense of rhythm to the painting, yet color varied independently of size and placement. This form of Divisionism was a significant step beyond the preoccupations of Signac and Cross. In 1906, the art critic Louis Chassevent recognized the difference and, as art historian Daniel Robbins pointed out, used the word &quot;cube&quot; which would later be taken up by Louis Vauxcelles to baptize Cubism. Chassevent writes: 
: M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...].

== Practice ==

The practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using red, green and blue (RGB) colors.

If red, blue, and green light (the additive primaries) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.

The painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture.

The majority of Pointillism is done in oil paint. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed.

== Music ==

Pointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism. This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie.
