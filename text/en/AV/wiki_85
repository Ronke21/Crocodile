<text>Sumner is a coastal seaside suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand, and was surveyed and named in 1849 in honour of John Bird Sumner, the then newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury and president of the Canterbury Association. Originally a separate borough, it was amalgamated with the city of Christchurch as communications improved and the economies of scale made small town boroughs uneconomic to operate.

==Toponymy==

Captain Thomas named the settlement for Bishop John Bird Sumner, one of the leading members of the Canterbury Association.

The Ngāi Tahu name for the beach between Cave Rock (&quot;Tuawera&quot;) and Scarborough is &quot;Matuku Tako Tako&quot;. This name has been used by both the state primary school and the city libraries.

A. W. Reed gives the Māori name for is &quot;Ohikaparuparu&quot; (&quot;o&quot; means place of; &quot;hika&quot; means rubbing, kindling, or planting; &quot;paruparu&quot; means dirt, deeply laden, or a preparation of fermented cockles). However, J. F Menzies indicates this name is associated with a settlement on the shores of the estuary between Redcliffs and Mt Pleasant and prefers an alternative translation of &quot;The place where sticks were rubbed together to make a fire with which to cook cockles in preparation for a journey&quot;. Andersen places this name on the beach at the mouth of the estuary, near Shag Rock (&quot;Rapanui&quot;). James Cowan, retelling Sir Maui Pomare, indicates this name applies to the estuary shallows and means &quot;fall in the mud&quot;.

==History==

Sumner was surveyed in 1849 by Edward Jollie for Captain Joseph Thomas, the advanced agent of the Canterbury Association. Jollie&#x27;s November 1849 map showed 527 sections and numerous reserved and provisions for churches, schools, cemeteries, town hall, emigration barracks and other town amenities. However, his plans were abandoned through lack of funds and a new survey on which Sumner is based was carried out in 1860.

The first European to carry out work in Sumner is believed to be Charles Crawford, a whaleboat owner, who transported materials from Port Cooper, now Lyttelton, under contract to build the headquarters and storeroom for Captain Thomas. Sumner was settled in late 1849 or early 1850 by work crews building the road to Lyttelton, Sumner is thus one of the oldest European settlements in the Christchurch area. The Day family was the first to settle permanently in Sumner followed by Edward Dobson and his family.
Sumner had its first shop early in 1870, and its proprietor, S.E. Horneman, was postmaster from 1873 until 1876.

In 1872, it came under the control of the Heathcote Road District. When provincial councils were disestablished in 1876 and replaced with counties, Sumner had a second parent body, the Selwyn County added to the continuing road board. In 1883, Sumner was constituted as a town district and was run by a board of five elected commissioners. The board elected its own chairmen, and the two people who filled that role were C. L. Wiggins (March 1883 – September 1884) and J. M. Wheeler (September 1884 – June 1891). On 1 June 1891, Sumner was proclaimed a borough. Mayoral elections were held on 27 June, and the last chairman was elected the first Mayor of Sumner.

In 1885 the Harbour Board granted the concession to build a bath at the East end of Sumner beach. S.L. Bell enclosed some of the sea, built dressing sheds and a tea shop. The bathing pool was a great attraction but every year terrific storms would batter the bath and gradually dump fine sand. Eventually a flood filled the bath with clay and silt from the hills causing its closure.

In 1912 Sumner established its own gasworks and electricity was connected in 1918. The Anglican evangelical leader William Orange was vicar of Sumner from 1930–1945.

On 22 February 2011, Sumner was hit by the Christchurch earthquake, which destroyed or made uninhabitable a large number of the local houses and commercial buildings. On 13 June the same year, Sumner was hit by another earthquake of almost the same magnitude as the February event. These two earthquakes caused many of Sumner&#x27;s iconic cliffs to collapse, and many areas to be cordoned off with both traditional fences and shipping containers.

==Geography==

Sumner is nestled in a coastal valley separated from the adjacent city suburbs by rugged volcanic hill ridges that end in cliffs that descend to the sea shore in places. Sumner Bay is the first bay on the northern side of Banks Peninsula and faces Pegasus Bay and the Pacific Ocean.

Because of its ocean exposure, a high surf can form in some swell conditions. The beach is gently sloping, with fine grey sand. It is a popular surf beach for these reasons.

Sand dunes have filled the river valley behind the beach. This has made housing construction relatively easy, although flooding at the head of the valley has been a problem in the past due to the reverse slope caused by the sand dunes filling the front of the valley. This has been addressed by a flood drain.

A sea wall and wide esplanade have been built along the length of the beach to prevent coastal erosion.

The rocky volcanic outcrop of Cave Rock, or &quot;Tuawera&quot; dominates the beach. Until the mid-1860s, this feature was known by Europeans as Cass Rock, after the surveyor Thomas Cass. There are other rocky outcrops in the area and the volcanic nature of the geology is readily apparent from several of the exposed cliffs around the valley.

Shag Rock, or &quot;Rapanui&quot;, is another large volcanic outcrop at the western end of the beach and sits at the mouth of the Estuary formed by the Avon and Heathcote rivers. This landmark was shattered by the Christchurch earthquakes in 2011, which reduced the iconic rock to a pile of boulders.

===Sumner bar===

The Sumner Bar is a sand bar where the estuary meets the sea and is notoriously dangerous to cross. The outlet of the Avon Heathcote Estuary, at the western end of the beach, forms the Sumner bar off shore of Cave Rock. The Sumner bar presents a major hazard to shipping, while the fast currents, strong rips and undertows in the area can be a danger to swimmers.

In December 1854, Commander Byron Drury, in HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;, surveyed the Sumner Bay, including the bar and mouth of the Avon-Heathcote Estuary for the Canterbury Provincial Council. Drury wrote a report and produced a detailed chart of the area, with soundings. Commander Drury&#x27;s 1854 chart locates several buildings on shore, including a store at the foot of the hill in Clifton Bay, Day&#x27;s house, which is set well back from the foreshore on a bend in the road, as it turns away from the foot of Clifton hill, and Dobson&#x27;s house, which is shown at end of the spur at the foot of Richmond Hill. Compared to a modern-day map, the Day&#x27;s house would have been near the corner at the top end of Nayland Street while Dobson&#x27;s house would be near the intersection of Nayland Street and Wakefield Avenue.

The earliest recorded accident crossing the Sumner Bar occurred in May 1845 when a whaleboat capsized, without loss of life. The earliest recorded loss of life was in 1851 when a dinghy capsizes and two men aboard drowned. The cutter &quot;Hawk&quot; broke up crossing the Sumner Bar in rough weather at the end of June 1851 and wrecked on the beach, though the crew survived, the cargo was plundered. Fifteen more vessels were recorded as stranding on the bar between 1851 and 1867, with 7 being total losses.

One regular vessel crossing the bar in the early days was the &quot;Mullogh&quot;, New Zealand&#x27;s first iron hulled steamer. On 25 August 1865 the &quot;Mullogh&quot; ran onto Cave Rock, Sumner, in violent surf. Her cargo of liquor created keen interest on the beach. George Holmes of Pigeon Bay, the contractor for the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel, then bought the ship, refitted and used her until 1869.

The NZ Trawler Muriel was stranded on Sumner Beach in 1937 and was a total loss and had to be dismantled where she lay.

==Community==
Sumner is a focal point for the adjacent suburbs of Clifton, Richmond Hill and Scarborough. In earlier times, residents of those suburbs would often have been considered to be living in Sumner, because these suburbs have road access via Sumner or depend on services available in Sumner. Before 1945, Sumner was a separate borough from Christchurch City. Also, before seven-digit landline telephone numbering was implemented in Christchurch (late 1980s or early 1990s), telephone subscribers in these suburbs would have had a four-digit Sumner telephone exchange number.

==Demographics==
The statistical area of Sumner, which includes Scarborough and Te Onepoto / Taylors Mistake, covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Sumner had a population of 3,519 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 36 people (1.0%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 249 people (−6.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,338 households, comprising 1,752 males and 1,764 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female. The median age was 42.6 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 714 people (20.3%) aged under 15 years, 483 (13.7%) aged 15 to 29, 1,806 (51.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 516 (14.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 95.6% European/Pākehā, 4.9% Māori, 0.6% Pasifika, 2.1% Asian, and 2.5% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 29.5, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 57.6% had no religion, 33.5% were Christian, 0.1% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.2% were Hindu, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.8% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 1,113 (39.7%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 216 (7.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $43,600, compared with $31,800 nationally. 879 people (31.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,419 (50.6%) people were employed full-time, 501 (17.9%) were part-time, and 66 (2.4%) were unemployed.

==Government==
The Canterbury Association initially administered Sumner, with the valley being surveyed by Edward Jollie in 1849 and he drew up a street plan in November of that year. However, the planned settlement was rejected by Godley and the land was not subdivided. When the first allocation of rural sections was made public in February 1851, rural section No.2 was allocated to Felix Wakefield. This section was bounded in the North by a road along the coast, in the West by the road between Christchurch and Lyttelton, by an accommodation road against the hillside in the East and another accommodation road across the valley in the South. The street names on the 1850 settlement plan were not used and Wakefield subdivided and leased or sold off parts of this rural section in smaller lots to create a settlement he called Wakefield Township.

After the Canterbury Association was disestablished, Sumner came under the control of the Canterbury Provincial Council. This lasted until the provinces were disestablished in 1876 and county councils were established instead. Sumner came under the jurisdiction of the Selwyn County Council initially.

A Town Board was established during the 1870s.

By the end of the 1880s Sumner had become a borough and administered the still mostly rural suburbs east of Ferrymead, including Mount Pleasant, Redcliffs, Moncks Bay, Clifton and Richmond Hill as well as the mostly undeveloped land between Scarborough and Godley Head, including Taylors Mistake.

By the 1940s, small town boroughs were becoming uneconomic and Sumner was merged with Christchurch city area.

Sumner is currently administered by the Christchurch City Council.

==Culture and heritage==
===Architecture===
The Pascoe House in Colenso Street is a category II historic place and an early example of a two story private dwelling in the Post War Modern Domestic style of the period between 1940 and 1960. It was designed by architect Paul Pascoe and constructed in 1948 as his own private home.

==Transport==
The need for a convenient route between the Port at Lyttelton and the plains settlement of Christchurch was quickly recognised by Captain Thomas, Chief Surveyor for the Canterbury Association. Settlement of flat land at Sumner was also planned at an early stage.

===By sea===
The Sumner Bar is a notable navigation hazard, though it can be crossed safely in the right wind, tide and sea conditions. However, with an exposed coast and no safe anchorage immediately off-shore, good seamanship is also required.

There is a small boat harbour, protected by a substantial breakwater, at the south-eastern end of Sumner Bay, below Scarborough. There is a slipway for launching small boats from a trailer, as well as the lifeboat station. However, the area has a tendency to silt up, as it is still exposed to wind and sea.

In 1849, this area was known as &quot;Sumner Nook&quot; and was the only comparatively safe place in the bay for landing from a boat, because of a lagoon formed by a small stream running into the sea in this area. But, with Sumner Bay open to the Pacific Ocean, there was no nearby safe anchorage for larger ships, short of Lyttelton Harbour, about 8 nautical miles away by sea. An early proposal, by Captain Thomas, was to builds a jetty here to unload ships and transport the cargo by tramway to the estuary beyond Shag Rock, to avoid ships having to cross the Sumner Bar, but a land option was chosen instead.

===By land===
A convenient land route between Lyttelton to Christchurch has been a requirement from the beginning of Canterbury settlement. While rail and road tunnels between Lyttelton to Christchurch have been constructed, there remains the need to transport goods that are too dangerous or too large to travel through one of the tunnel. The route via Sumner remains a necessary transport alternative.

Construction of a road from Lyttelton to Christchurch via Evans Pass and Sumner began in 1849. However, progress was slow due to steep hillsides and hard volcanic rock being encountered. In 1850, a Bridle Path was cut directly over the saddle between Lyttelton and the Heathcote Valley so that the early settlers could travel to Ferrymead by foot and pack horse, while their heavy goods still needed to be transported across the Sumner Bar by boat. Road construction on the western side of the Sumner valley ceased in 1851 when construction encountered steep volcanic bluffs and funds ran out. The original road line, now known as Captain Thomas&#x27; Track, was abandoned and a new way down the eastern side of the valley between Evans Pass and Sumner was subsequently found and constructed. In 1952, the suburb was linked by several bus routes to its neighbouring suburbs and the central city.

Today, Southshore&#x27;s public transportation is served by the frequent Airport (or Sheffield Crescent)—Sumner (route 3) bus service operated under the Metro brand. It serves the suburb to its neighbouring suburbs and the final destination of the route being Christchurch International Airport.

===Public transport===

A tramway opened to Sumner on 1 November 1888.

==Education==
=== Sumner School ===
Sumner School was founded in 1876 and is these days a full primary school, teaching children from years 1 to 8. The school has a roll of students as of 

=== Our Lady Star of the Sea School ===
Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic School is a full primary school, teaching children from years 1 to 8. The school has a roll of students. It opened in 1928.

=== Ko Taku Reo ===

The former van Asch College, which took hearing-impaired children from all over the South Island and the southern North Island, is now a residential campus for Ko Taku Reo. It opened in 1880 as Sumner School for the Deaf.

=== Sumner College ===
Variously known as &quot;&quot;Sumner College&quot;, &quot;Beach Glen Boarding School&quot; or &quot;Chelford&quot;&quot;, existed in Sumner between about 1877 and 1895. Schoolmaster C. L. Wiggins, as he was almost invariably known, appears to have moved his boarding school for young gentlemen to Sumner in August 1877, according to newspaper advertisements of the time. Wiggins has previously operated his boarding school at Akaroa and Fernside, before moving to Sumner. The school taught &quot;the usual branches of a sound English education, together with Latin and French&quot; and provided recreations including sea bathing, cricket, and &quot;pedestrian excursions&quot;. Wiggins expanded his school at Sumner and built the dormitories and school rooms that were later leased and then sold to the Government School for the Deaf in the mid 1880s. From 1896, Wiggans was the Assistant Master in the Lower School of Christ&#x27;s College. He subsequently founded a preparatory school in Durham Street, where he taught until he was 80 years old.

Clement Lester Wiggins was born in England in 1843, and educated at various schools before arriving in Lyttelton in 1861, aged 18. By 1870, he had become headmaster of the Akaroa public school, and served there for three years, before founding a private boarding school. He was also a church organist, Sunday school teacher, a founding member of the Sumner Lawn Tennis Club, and involved in local body politics. He died on 18 August 1927, aged 84.

==Sumner Life Boat Institution==

Because of the hazard posed by the Sumner Bar, Sumner has had a lifeboat of some kind almost since its settlement. There is no record of a formal or even informal lifeboat being available prior to the appointment of a pilot in September 1864. However, it is likely that small open rowing boats were available in the bay from the early 1850s.

The Sumner Life Boat Institution has operated a formal life boat or similar rescue craft in the bay since 1898. The traditional name of &quot;Rescue&quot; has been applied to three of the life boats.

<text>Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle (; ; 11 February 1657 
– 9 January 1757), also called Bernard Le Bouyer de Fontenelle, was a French author and an influential member of three of the academies of the Institut de France, noted especially for his accessible treatment of scientific topics during the unfolding of the Age of Enlightenment.

==Biography==
Fontenelle was born in Rouen, France (then the capital of Normandy) and died in Paris at age 99. His mother was the sister of great French dramatists Pierre and Thomas Corneille. His father, François le Bovier de Fontenelle, was a lawyer who worked in the provincial court of Rouen and came from a family of lawyers from Alençon. 

He trained in the law but gave up after one case, devoting his life to writing about philosophers and scientists, especially defending the Cartesian tradition. In spite of the undoubted merit and value of his writings, both to the laity and the scientific community, there is no question of his being a primary contributor to the field. He was a commentator and explicator and occasionally a passionate, though generally good-humoured, controversialist.

He was educated at the college of the Jesuits, the &quot;Lycée Pierre Corneille&quot; (although it did not adopt the name of his uncle (Pierre Corneille) until 1873, about 200 years later). At the Lycée he showed a preference for literature and distinguished himself.

According to Bernard de Fontenelle, Blondel was a disciple of Father Marin Mersenne at the &quot;Academia Parisiensis&quot; in the French capital, until 1649. There he met &quot;Messieurs Gassendi, Descartes, Hobbes, Roberval, and the two Pascals, father and son&quot;.

==Early work==
He began as a poet, writing a poem in Latin at the age of 13 and more than once competed for prizes of the Académie française, but he never won anything. He visited Paris from time to time and became friendly with the abbé de Saint-Pierre, the abbé Vertot and the mathematician Pierre Varignon. He witnessed, in 1680, the total failure of his tragedy &quot;Aspar&quot;. Fontenelle afterwards acknowledged the public verdict by burning his unfortunate drama. His libretto for Pascal Collasse&#x27;s &quot;Thétis et Pélée&quot; (&quot;Thetis and Peleus&quot;), which premiered at the Opéra de Paris in January, 1689, was received with great acclaim. 

His &quot;Lettres galantes du chevalier d&#x27;Her ...&quot;, published anonymously in 1685, was a collection of letters portraying worldly society of the time. It immediately made its mark. In 1686 his famous allegory of Rome and Geneva, slightly disguised as the rival princesses Mreo and Eenegu, in the &quot;Relation de l&#x27;île de Bornéo&quot;, gave proof of his daring in religious matters. But it was by his &quot;Nouveaux Dialogues des morts&quot; (1683) that Fontenelle established a genuine claim to high literary rank.

That claim was enhanced three years later by what has been summarised as the most influential work on the plurality of worlds in the period, &quot;Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes&quot; (1686). He wrote extensively on the nature of the universe: &quot;Behold a universe so immense that I am lost in it. I no longer know where I am. I am just nothing at all. Our world is terrifying in its insignificance.&quot;

==Later work==
Fontenelle had made his home in Rouen. In 1687 he moved to Paris. In 1687 he published his &quot;Histoire des oracles&quot;, a book which made a considerable stir in theological and philosophical circles. It consisted of two essays, the first of which was designed to prove that oracles were not given by the supernatural agency of demons, and the second that they did not cease with the birth of Jesus. 

It excited the suspicion of the Church, and a Jesuit, by name Jean-François Baltus, published a ponderous refutation of it; but the peace-loving disposition of its author impelled him to leave his opponent unanswered. To the following year (1688) belongs his &quot;Digression sur les anciens et les modernes&quot;, in which he took the modern side in the controversy then raging; his &quot;Doutes sur le système physique des causes occasionnelles&quot; (against Nicolas Malebranche) appeared shortly afterwards.

He remained influential in his older years and when a then unknown Jean-Jacques Rousseau met him in 1742, when Fontenelle was 85, he passed on the advice he gave all young writers that came to him: &quot;You must courageously offer your brow to laurel wreaths and your nose to blows.&quot;

A noted gourmand, he attributed his longevity to eating strawberries. At ninety-two, one observer wrote that he was as lively as a man of twenty-two. When, in his late nineties, he met the then-beautiful Madame Helvétius, he reportedly told her, &quot;Ah Madame, if only I were eighty again!&quot;

==Member of the French Academy==
In 1691 he was received into the French Academy in spite of the determined efforts of the partisans of the &quot;ancients&quot;, especially Racine and Boileau, who on four previous occasions had ensured his rejection. He was thus a member both of the Academy of Inscriptions and of the Academy of Sciences. In 1697 he became perpetual secretary to the Academy of Sciences, an office he held for forty-two years. It was in this official capacity that he wrote the &quot;Histoire du renouvellement de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot; (Paris, 3 vols., 1708, 1717, 1722) containing extracts and analyses of the proceedings, and also the &quot;éloges&quot; of the members, written with great simplicity and delicacy.

Perhaps the best known of his &quot;éloges&quot;, of which there are sixty-nine in all, is that of his uncle Pierre Corneille. This was first printed in the &quot;Nouvelles de la republique des lettres&quot; (January 1685) and, as &quot;Vie de Corneille&quot;, was included in all the editions of Fontenelle&#x27;s &quot;Œuvres.&quot; The other important works of Fontenelle are his &quot;Éléments de la géometrie de l&#x27;infini&quot; (1727) and his &quot;Théorie des tourbillons&quot; (1752). In the latter he supported the views of René Descartes concerning gravitation, material that by that time had effectively been superseded by the work of Isaac Newton.

He is noted for the accessibility of his work – particularly its novelistic style. This allowed non-scientists to appreciate scientific development in a time where this was unusual, and scientists to benefit from the thoughts of the greater society. If his writing is often seen as trying to popularize the astronomical theories of Descartes, whose greatest exponent he is sometimes considered, it also appealed to the literate society of the day to become more involved in &quot;natural philosophy,&quot; thus enriching the work of early-Enlightenment scientists. In spite of the inarguable value and quality of his writings, he had no serious pretensions to original scientific or mathematical work, but did not let that stop him from outspoken support for Descartes&#x27; proposed conceptions of the roles of vortices in physics.

==Legacy==
Fontenelle was a popular figure in the educated French society of his period, byholding a position of esteem comparable only to that of Voltaire. Unlike Voltaire, however, Fontenelle avoided making important enemies. He balanced his penchant for universal critical thought with liberal doses of flattery and praise to the appropriate individuals in aristocratic society.

Fontenelle forms a link between two very widely different periods of French literature, that of Corneille, Racine and Boileau on the one hand, and that of Voltaire, D&#x27;Alembert and Diderot on the other. It is not in virtue of his great age alone that this can be said of him; he actually had much in common with the &quot;beaux esprits&quot; of the 17th century, as well as with the &quot;philosophes&quot; of the 18th. But it is to the latter rather than to the former period that he properly belongs.

According to Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, he deserves a place &quot;dans la classe des esprits infiniment distingués&quot; but is distinguished by being ought to be added by intelligence rather than by intellect and less by the power of saying much than by the power of saying a little well.
There have been several collected editions of Fontenelle&#x27;s works, the first being printed in 3 vols. at the Hague in 1728–1729. The best is that of Paris, in 8 vols., 1790. Some of his separate works have been frequently reprinted and also translated. 

The &quot;Pluralité des mondes&quot; was translated into modern Greek in 1794. Sainte-Beuve has an interesting essay on Fontenelle, with several useful references, in the &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;, vol. iii. See also Villemain, &quot;Tableau de la littérature française au XVIIIe siècle&quot;; the abbé Trublet, &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l&#x27;histoire de la vie et des ouvrages de M. de Fontenelle&quot; (1759); A Laborde-Milaà, &quot;Fontenelle&quot; (1905), in the &quot;Grands écrivains français&quot; series; and L. Maigron, &quot;Fontenelle, l&#x27;homme, l&#x27;œuvre, l&#x27;influence&quot; (Paris, 1906).

His &quot;Dialogues of the dead&quot; show both his erudition and wit by presenting invented but plausible dialogues between dead ancients, dead moderns and a whole book devoted to dialogues between an ancient and a modern. To Montaigne asking him if some centuries had more wise men than other, Socrates answers sadly, &quot;The general order of natures seems very constant&quot;. In one of the books Roxelane and Anne Boleyn discuss about politics and the way for a woman to decide a man to marry her. The dialogue between Montezuma and Cortez allows the former to dismiss some myths about the wisdom in ancient Greece by quoting some counter-examples.

In 1935, the lunar crater Fontenelle was named after him.

<doc id="165163" wikidata="Q188857" url="?curid=165163" title="Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux">
<text>Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux (; 1 November 1636 – 13 March 1711), often known simply as Boileau (, ), was a French poet and critic. He did much to reform the prevailing form of French poetry, in the same way that Blaise Pascal did to reform the prose. He was greatly influenced by Horace.

==Family and education==
Boileau was the fifteenth child of Gilles Boileau, a clerk in the Parlement of Paris. Two of his brothers attained some distinction: Gilles Boileau, the author of a translation of Epictetus; and Jacques Boileau, who became a canon of the Sainte-Chapelle, and made valuable contributions to church history. The surname &quot;Despréaux&quot; was derived from a small property at Crosne near Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. His mother died when he was two years old; and Nicolas Boileau, who had a delicate constitution, seems to have suffered something from want of care.

Sainte-Beuve puts down his somewhat hard and unsympathetic outlook quite as much to the uninspiring circumstances of these days as to the general character of his time. He cannot be said to have been early disenchanted, for he never seems to have had any illusions; he grew up with a single passion, &quot;the hatred of stupid books.&quot; He was educated at the Collège de Beauvais, and was then sent to study theology at the Sorbonne. He exchanged theology for law, however, and was called to the bar on December 4, 1656. From the profession of law, after a short trial, he recoiled in disgust, complaining bitterly of the amount of chicanery which passed under the name of law and justice. His father died in 1657, leaving him a small fortune, and thenceforward he devoted himself to letters.

==1660s==
Much of Boileau&#x27;s early poems as have been preserved hardly contain the promise of what he ultimately became. The first piece in which his peculiar powers were displayed was the first satire (1660), in imitation of the third satire of Juvenal; it embodied the farewell of a poet to the city of Paris. This was quickly followed by eight others, and the number was at a later period increased to twelve. A twofold interest attaches to the satires. In the first place the author skilfully parodies and attacks writers who at the time were placed in the very first rank, such as Jean Chapelain, the abbé Charles Cotin, Philippe Quinault and Georges de Scudéry; he openly raised the standard of revolt against the older poets. But in the second place he showed both by precept and practice what were the poetical capabilities of the French language. Prose in the hands of such writers as René Descartes and Blaise Pascal had proved itself a flexible and powerful instrument of expression, with a distinct mechanism and form. But except with Francois de Malherbe, there had been no attempt to fashion French versification according to rule or method. In Boileau for the first time appeared terseness and vigour of expression, with perfect regularity of verse structure.

His admiration for Molière found expression in the stanzas addressed to him (1663) and in the second satire (1664). In 1664 or 1665, he composed his prose &quot;Dialogue sur les héros de roman&quot;, a satire on the elaborate romances of the time, which may be said to have once for all abolished the lucubrations of La Calprenède, Mlle de Scudéry and their fellows. Though fairly widely read in manuscript and also released in an unauthorized edition in 1668, the book was not published till 1713, out of regard, it is said, for Mlle de Scudéry. To these early days belong the reunions at the Mouton Blanc and the Pomme du Pin, where Boileau, Molière, Jean Racine, Jean de La Chapelle and Antoine Furetière met to discuss literary questions. To Molière and Racine he proved a constant friend, and supported their interests on many occasions.

In 1666, prompted by the publication of two unauthorized editions, he published &quot;Satires du Sieur D...&quot;, containing seven satires and the Discours au roi. From 1669 onwards appeared his &quot;epistles&quot;, graver in tone than the satires, maturer in thought, more exquisite and polished in style. The &quot;Épîtres&quot; gained for him the favour of Louis XIV, who desired his presence at court. The king asked him which he thought his best verses. Whereupon Boileau diplomatically selected as his &quot;least bad&quot; some still unprinted lines in honour of the grand monarch and proceeded to recite them. He received forthwith a pension of 2000 livres.

==1670s==
In 1674 Boileau&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Art poétique&quot; (in imitation of the &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; of Horace) and &quot;Le Lutrin&quot; were published with some earlier works as the &quot;L&#x27;Œuvres diverses du sieur D...&quot;. Boileau rules on the language of poetry, and analyses various kinds of verse composition. He influenced English literature through the translation of &quot;L&#x27;Art poétique&quot; by Sir William Soame and John Dryden, and their imitation in Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Criticism&quot;.

Of the four books of &quot;L&#x27;Art poétique&quot;, the first and last consist of general precepts, inculcating mainly the great rule of &quot;bon sens&quot;; the second treats of the pastoral, the elegy, the ode, the epigram and satire; and the third of tragic and epic poetry. Though the rules laid down are of value, their tendency is rather to hamper and render too mechanical the efforts of poetry. Boileau himself, a great, though, by no means infallible critic in verse, cannot be considered a great poet. He rendered the utmost service in destroying the exaggerated reputations of the mediocrities of his time, but his judgment was sometimes at fault. The &quot;Lutrin&quot;, a mock heroic poem, of which four cantos appeared in 1674, is sometimes said to have furnished Alexander Pope with a model for the Rape of the Lock, but the English poem is superior in richness of imagination and subtlety of invention. The fifth and sixth cantos, afterwards added by Boileau, rather detract from the beauty of the poem; the last canto in particular is quite unworthy of his genius.

In 1674 Boileau published his translation of Longinus&#x27; &quot;On the Sublime&quot;, making Longinus&#x27; ideas available to a wider audience, and influencing Edmund Burke&#x27;s work on the same subject. In 1693 he added some critical reflections to the translation, chiefly directed against the theory of the superiority of the moderns over the ancients as advanced by Charles Perrault.

Boileau was made historiographer to the king in 1677. From this time the amount of his production diminished. To this period of his life belong the satire, &quot;Sur les femmes&quot;, the ode, &quot;Sur la prise de Namur&quot;, the epistles, &quot;A mes vers&quot; and &quot;Sur l&#x27;amour de Dieu&quot;, and the satire &quot;Sur l&#x27;homme&quot;. The satires had raised up a crowd of enemies against Boileau. The 10th satire, on women, provoked an &quot;Apologie des femmes&quot; from Charles Perrault. Antoine Arnauld in the year of his death wrote a letter in defence of Boileau, but when at the desire of his friends he submitted his reply to Bossuet, the bishop pronounced all satire to be incompatible with the spirit of Christianity, and the 10th satire to be subversive of morality. The friends of Antoine Arnauld had declared that it was inconsistent with the dignity of a churchman to write on any subject so trivial as poetry. The epistle, &quot;Sur l&#x27;amour de Dieu&quot;, was a triumphant vindication on the part of Boileau of the dignity of his art. It was not until April 15, 1684, that he was admitted to the Académie française, and then only by the king&#x27;s wish. In 1687 he retired to a country-house he had bought at Auteuil, which Jean Racine, because of the numerous guests, calls his &quot;hôtellerie d&#x27;Auteuil&quot;.

==1700–1711==
In 1705 Boileau sold his house and returned to Paris, where he lived with his confessor in the cloisters of Notre Dame. In the 12th satire, &quot;Sur l&#x27;équivoque&quot;, he attacked the Jesuits in verses which Sainte-Beuve called a recapitulation of the &quot;Lettres provinciales&quot; of Pascal. This was written about 1705. He then gave his attention to the arrangement of a complete and definitive edition of his works. But the Jesuit fathers obtained from Louis XIV the withdrawal of the privilege already granted for the publication, and demanded the suppression of the 12th satire. These annoyances are said to have hastened his death, which took place on 13 March 1711.

He was a man of warm and kindly feelings, honest, outspoken and benevolent. Many anecdotes are told of his frankness of speech at court, and of his generous actions. He holds a well-defined place in French literature, as the first who reduced its versification to rule, and taught the value of workmanship for its own sake. His influence on English literature, through Pope and his contemporaries, was not less strong, though less durable. After much undue depreciation, Boileau&#x27;s critical work has been rehabilitated by recent writers, perhaps to the extent of some exaggeration in the other direction. It has been shown that in spite of undue harshness in individual cases most of his criticisms have been substantially adopted by his successors.

Numerous editions of Boileau&#x27;s works were published during his lifetime. The last of these, &quot;l&#x27;Œuvres diverses&quot; (1701), known as the &quot;favourite&quot; edition of the poet, was reprinted with variants and notes by Alphonse Pauly (2 vols., 1894). The critical text of his works was established by Berriat Saint-Prix, &quot;Œuvres de Boileau&quot; (4 vols., 1830–1837), who made use of some 350 editions. This text, edited with notes by Paul Chéron, with the &quot;Boloeana&quot; of 1740, and an essay by Sainte-Beuve, was reprinted by Garnier frères (1860).

<text>François de Malherbe (, 1555 – 16 October 1628) was a French poet, critic, and translator.

==Life==
He was born in Le Locheur (near Caen, Normandie), to a family of standing, although the family&#x27;s pedigree did not satisfy the heralds in terms of its claims to nobility pre-16th century. Francois the poet was the eldest son of another François de Malherbe, &quot;conseiller du roi&quot; in the magistracy of Caen. He himself was elaborately educated at Caen, at Paris, at Heidelberg and at Basel. At the age of twenty-one, preferring arms to the gown, he entered the household of Henri d&#x27;Angoulême, the illegitimate son of Henry II, governor of Provence. He served this prince as secretary in Provence, and married there in 1581. It seems that he wrote verses at this period, but, to judge from a quotation of Tallemant des Réaux, they must have been very bad ones. His patron died when Malherbe was on a visit in his native province, and for a time he had no particular employment, though by some servile verses he obtained a considerable gift of money from Henry III, whom he afterwards libelled. He lived partly in Provence and partly in Normandy for many years after this event; but very little is known of his life during this period. His &quot;Larmes de Saint Pierre&quot;, imitated from Luigi Tansillo, appeared in 1587.

It was in 1600 that he presented to Maria de&#x27; Medici an ode of welcome, the first of his remarkable poems. But four or five years more passed before his fortune, which had hitherto been indifferent, turned. He was presented by his countryman, the Cardinal Du Perron, to Henry IV; and, though that economical prince did not at first show any great eagerness to entertain the poet, he was at last summoned to court and endowed after one fashion or another. It is said that the pension promised him was not paid till the next reign. His father died in 1606, and he came into his inheritance.

From this time forward he lived at court, corresponding affectionately with his wife, but seeing her only twice in some twenty years. His old age was saddened by a great misfortune. His son, Marc Antoine, a young man of promise, died in a duel against Paul de Fortia de Piles. Malherbe suspected foul play and used his utmost influence to have the de Fortia and Jean Baptiste de Covet (de Fortia&#x27;s second in the duel) brought to justice. Malherbe died before the suit was decided; it is said in consequence of disease caught at the siege of La Rochelle, where he had gone to petition the king. Malherbe died in Paris, on 16 October 1628, at the age of seventy-three, only 15 months after his son.

The football team from Caen, France, &quot;Stade Malherbe de Caen&quot;, is named after him.

==Works==

Malherbe exercised, or at least indicated the exercise of, a great and enduring effect upon French literature, though not exactly a wholly beneficial one. From the time of Malherbe dates the gradual development of the poetic rules of &quot;Classicism&quot; that would dominate for nearly two centuries until the Romantics. The critical and restraining tendency of Malherbe who preached greater technical perfection, and especially greater simplicity and purity in vocabulary and versification, was a sober correction to the luxuriant importation and innovation of Pierre de Ronsard and La Pléiade, but the lines of praise by Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux beginning &quot;Enfin Malherbe vint&quot; (&quot;Finally Malherbe arrived&quot;) are rendered only partially applicable by Boileau&#x27;s ignorance of older French poetry.

The personal character of Malherbe, whose writings demonstrate a bludgeon-like wit, was far from amiable; the good as well as bad side of Malherbe&#x27;s theory and practice is excellently described by his contemporary and rival Mathurin Régnier, who was animated against Malherbe, not merely by reason of his own devotion to Ronsard but because of Malherbe&#x27;s discourtesy towards Régnier&#x27;s uncle Philippe Desportes, whom the Norman poet had at first distinctly plagiarised.

Malherbe&#x27;s reforms helped to elaborate the kind of verse necessary for the classical tragedy, but his own poetical work is scanty in amount, and for the most part frigid and lacking inspiration. The beautiful &quot;Consolation a Duperier&quot;, in which occurs the famous line – – the odes to Marie de&#x27; Medici and to Louis XIII, are the best-remembered of his works.

His prose work is much more abundant, not less remarkable for care as to style and expression, and of greater positive value. It consists of some translations of Livy and Seneca, and of a very large number of interesting and admirably written letters, many of which are addressed to Peiresc, the man of science of whom Gassendi has left a delightful Latin life. It also contains a most curious commentary on Desportes, in which Malherbe&#x27;s minute and carping style of verbal criticism is displayed on the great scale.

Malherbe&#x27;s two most important disciples were François Maynard and Racan; Claude Favre de Vaugelas is credited with having purified French diction at about the same time.

==In popular culture==

The Caen-based association football club Stade Malherbe Caen, founded in 1913, takes its name from the poet.

== Bibliography ==
The chief authorities for the biography of Malherbe are the &quot;Vie de Malherbe&quot; by his friend and pupil Racan, and the long &quot;Historiette&quot; which Tallemant des Réaux has devoted to him. The standard edition is &quot;Oeuvres poétiques&quot;, edited by René Fromilhague and Raymond Lebègue, 1968 . Antoine Adam&#x27;s popular collection of Malherbe&#x27;s &quot;Poésies&quot;, is based on his Pléiade edition, (1982). Secondary sources: &quot;La Doctrine de Malherbe&quot;, by G Brunot (1891), is a classic . René Fromilhague, &quot;Malherbe: Technique et création poétique&quot; (1954). Close readings of major poems appear in David Lee Rubin, &quot;High Hidden Order: Design and Meaning in the Odes of Malherbe&quot; (1972), revisited in the appendix to the same author&#x27;s &quot;The Knot of Artifice: A Poetic of the French Lyric in the Early 17th Century&quot; (1981); also see Chapter 1. Claude K. Abraham&#x27;s &quot;Enfin Malherbe&quot; (1971) which focuses on the influence of Malherbe&#x27;s prosody.

<text>My Left Foot is the 1954 autobiography of Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy on 5 June 1932 in Dublin, Ireland. As one of 13 surviving children, Brown went on to be an author, painter and poet.

==Plot==
Brown begins his book by telling the reader about his early childhood. When he was four months old, Brown&#x27;s mother was the first to notice that there was something wrong with his health. He could not hold his head upright or control his body movements. After seeking medical advice, the family&#x27;s worst fears were confirmed: Christy was physically disabled and had an incurable disability called cerebral palsy. His family, besides his mother, thought he was an idiot. They told his mother to give up.

Although the doctors did not believe in Brown&#x27;s mental intelligence, his mother did not lose faith in her son and supported him as a full member of the family.

A transforming moment occurs in the young boy&#x27;s life that proves him to be intelligent. He discovers that he can control his left foot and toes. At the age of five, he snatches a piece of yellow chalk from his sister with his left foot. He marks the letter &quot;A&quot; on the floor with his foot and the help of his mother. He had wanted to make what he described as, &quot;a wild sort of scribble with it on the slate&quot;. It is from this incident that the book received its title. In this moment, Brown had found a way to express himself since he could not speak.

Throughout his childhood, Brown played with local children and with his siblings, assisted by a small cart that he called &quot;Henry&quot;. As time went on, he became more introverted, as he began to realize that his disability made him different from his family and friends and impeded his enjoyment of life. Through this struggle, he discovered his creative and artistic talents, becoming devoted to literature, writing and painting. He used his left foot to carry out these tasks.

At the age of 18, Brown went to Lourdes in France. Here, he met individuals whose disabilities were even worse than his. For the first time in his life, he began to experience energy and hope. He also began to accept himself as the person he was, and do the best with what he had. He started a new treatment for cerebral palsy, which led to the improvement of his speech and physical condition.

In his teenage years, he met the Irish doctor Robert Collis. Collis had established a clinic for cerebral palsy patients and Brown was his first patient at this clinic. Collis was also a noted author, and guided Brown on how to write. This too involved a kind of therapy of intensive practice and exercises. Collis was involved in the two first drafts of this book and its final version.

The autobiography makes reference to its own creation. The final pages tell of Collis reading the first chapter of the book to the audience at a fundraising event. The chapter was warmly received by those in attendance.

<text>Philippe Quinault (; 3 June 1635 – 26 November 1688) was a French dramatist and librettist.

== Biography ==

Quinault was born in Paris. He was educated by the liberality of François Tristan l&#x27;Hermite, the author of &quot;Marianne&quot;. Quinault&#x27;s first play was produced at the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1653, when he was only eighteen. The piece succeeded, and Quinault followed it up, but he also read for the bar; and in 1660, when he married a widow with money, he bought himself a place in the &quot;Cour des Comptes&quot;. Then he tried tragedies (&quot;Agrippa&quot;, etc.) with more success.

He received one of the literary pensions then recently established, and was elected to the Académie française in 1670. Up to this time he had written some sixteen or seventeen comedies, tragedies, and tragi-comedies, which began at the &quot;Hôtel de Bourgogne&quot; in 1653, and of which the tragedies were mostly of very small value and the tragi-comedies of little more. But his comedies—especially his first piece &quot;Les Rivales&quot; (1653), &quot;L&#x27;Amant indiscret&quot; (1654), which has some likeness to Molière&#x27;s &quot;Étourdi, Le Fantôme amoureux&quot; (1659), and &quot;La Mère coquette&quot; (1665), perhaps the best—are much better. In assessing Quinault&#x27;s comedy work, Patricia Howard noted the influence of Préciosité, especially in the female roles: &quot;For if in French theatre in the second half of the century, women&#x27;s roles are preeminent, it was the précieux movement which made them so.&quot; In 1671 he contributed to the singular miscellany of &quot;Psyché&quot;, in which Pierre Corneille and Molière also had a hand, and which was set to the music of Jean-Baptiste Lully.

Here he showed a remarkable faculty for lyrical drama, and from this time until just before his death he confined himself to composing libretti for Lully&#x27;s work. This was not only very profitable (for he is said to have received four thousand livres for each, which was much more than was usually paid even for tragedy), but it established Quinault&#x27;s reputation as the master of a new style—so that even Boileau, who had previously satirized his dramatic work, praised, not the opera, which he did not like, but Quinault&#x27;s remarkably ingenious and artist-like work in it.

His libretti are among the very few which are readable without the music, and which are yet carefully adapted to it. The very artificiality of the French lyric of the later 17th century, and its resemblance to alexandrines cut into lengths, were aids to Quinault in arranging lyrical dialogue. They certainly do not contain very exalted poetry or very perfect drama. But they are quite free from the ludicrous doggerel which has made the name libretto a byword, and they have quite enough dramatic merit to carry the reader, much more the spectator, along with them. It is not an exaggeration to say that Quinault, coming at the exact time when opera became fashionable out of Italy, had very much to do with establishing it as a permanent European genre. His first piece after &quot;Psyché&quot; (1671) was a kind of classical masque, &quot;Les Fêtes de l&#x27;Amour et de Bacchus&quot; (1672). Then came &quot;Cadmus et Hermione&quot; (1674), &quot;Alceste ou le Triomphe d&#x27;Alcide&quot; (1674), &quot;Thésée&quot; (1675), &quot;Atys&quot; (1676), one of his best pieces, and &quot;Isis&quot; (1677). &quot;Alceste&quot; was received very negatively by some critics, and this inspired a debate of published opinions by the writers Jean Racine and Charles Perrault which constitutes one of the first exchanges in what would later become known as the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns.

All these were classical in subject, and so was &quot;Proserpine&quot; (1680), which was superior to any of them. &quot;The Triumph of Love&quot; (1681) is a mere ballet, but in &quot;Persée&quot; (1682) and &quot;Phaëton&quot; (1683) Quinault returned to the classical opera. Then he finally deserted it for romantic subjects, in which he was even more successful. &quot;Amadis de Gaule&quot; (1684) and &quot;Roland&quot; (1685) are arguably his masterpieces, although &quot;Armide&quot; (1686) is probably the best known opera. Lully died in 1687, and Quinault, his occupation gone, became devout, and began a poem called the &quot;Destruction of Heresy&quot;. He died on 26 November 1688, in Paris. Among his less known works is the lyrical, theatrical drama &quot;Bellerephon&quot;, in 2 parts: (one probably first published on 1671 and one probably first published on 1679 ), based on the famous, ancient Greek myth:

<text>The Earthsea Cycle, also known as Earthsea, is a series of high fantasy books written by American author Ursula K. Le Guin. Beginning with &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; (1968), &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, (1970) and &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; (1972), the series was continued in &quot;Tehanu&quot; (1990), and &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; and &quot;The Other Wind&quot; (both 2001). In 2018, all the novels and short stories were published in a single volume, &quot;The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition&quot;, with artwork by Charles Vess.

== Setting ==

The world of Earthsea is one of sea and islands: a vast archipelago of hundreds of islands surrounded by mostly uncharted ocean. Earthsea contains no large continents. The largest island, Havnor, at approximately across, is about the size of Great Britain. The cultures of Earthsea are literate non-industrial civilizations and not direct analogues of the real world. The overall climate of Earthsea is temperate, comparable to the mid-latitudes (over a distance of about ) of the northern hemisphere of the Earth. There is a yearly transition from warm summers to cold and snowy winters, especially on northern islands like Gont and Osskil. In the southern regions of Earthsea, it can be much warmer.

Most of the people of Earthsea are described as having brown skin. In the Archipelago, &quot;red-brown&quot; skin is typical; however, the people of the East Reach have darker &quot;black-brown&quot; complexions. The people of Osskil in the north are described as having lighter, sallow complexions, while the Kargs of the Kargad Lands are &quot;white-skinned&quot; and often &quot;yellow-haired&quot;. Le Guin has criticized what she described as the general assumption in fantasy that characters should be white and the society should resemble the European Middle Ages.

Magic is a central part of life in most of Earthsea; the exception being the Kargish lands, where it is forbidden. There are weather workers on ships, fixers who repair boats and buildings, entertainers, and court sorcerers. Magic is an inborn talent which can be refined with training. The most gifted are sent to the school on Roke, where, if their skill and discipline prove sufficient, they can become staff-carrying wizards.

The Dry Land is where most people go after they die, with the exception of the Kargs. It is a realm of shadow and dust, of eternal night where the stars are fixed in the sky, and nothing changes. The souls who reside there have an empty, dreary existence, and even &quot;lovers pass each other in silence&quot;. Le Guin has stated that the idea of the Dry Land came from the &quot;Greco-Roman idea of Hades&#x27; realm, from certain images in Dante Alighieri&#x27;s work, and from one of Rainer Maria Rilke&#x27;s Elegies&quot;. In the fifth and last novel of the series, &quot;The Other Wind&quot;, it is revealed that the Dry Land is a part of the dragons&#x27; domain that was stolen from them by the earliest mages in an attempt gone awry to obtain immortality. The Dry Land is restored to the dragons at the end of &quot;The Other Wind&quot;.

== Series ==
=== Books ===

Le Guin originally intended for &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; to be a standalone novel, but she wrote &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; as a sequel after considering the loose ends in the first book; &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; followed after further consideration. These three books were written in quick succession, from 1968 to 1972, and are sometimes seen as the &quot;original trilogy&quot;. Nearly twenty years later, Le Guin wrote a fourth book, &quot;Tehanu&quot; (1990), and followed it with &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; and &quot;The Other Wind&quot; in 2001. The latter three books are sometimes referred to as the &quot;second trilogy&quot;. The series as a whole is known as the &quot;Earthsea Cycle&quot;, and was published in a single volume in 2018 as &quot;The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition&quot;, with art by Charles Vess.

=== Short stories ===
Le Guin published nine short stories of Earthsea.
Seven appear in two collections of her work (and some have been reissued elsewhere). Two early stories were originally published in 1964, and were collected in &quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot; (Harper &amp; Row, 1975). These helped to define the setting of Earthsea. Five much later stories were collected in &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; (Harcourt, 2001), where three were original. In October 2014, a new novella set in Earthsea was published as a stand-alone, &quot;The Daughter of Odren&quot;. A final 12-page short story, &quot;Firelight&quot;, was published in June 2018, covering the last days of Ged.

Tales from Earthsea also includes about 30 pages of fictional reference material titled &quot;A Description of Earthsea&quot; (2001).

=== Unsubmitted story ===
After &quot;The Rule of Names&quot; and before &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, Le Guin wrote a long story about a prince in search of the Ultimate. He travels south-west from Havnor through the archipelago into the open sea. There he finds a raft-colony and sea-people, whom he joins in the sea. The prince wears out, sinks and finds the Ultimate. This story was never submitted for publication because &quot;it never worked out itself well&quot;. However, the theme of a raft-colony and sea-people was later taken up as an important ingredient in the plot of &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;.

== Awards ==
Each book in the series has received a literary award:
On November 5, 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;The Earthsea Trilogy&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Adaptations==
===Audiobooks===
There have been a number of audiobook readings by different narrators and publishers. In the early 1990s, Robert Inglis narrated the first three books of the series for Recorded Books.

===Radio===
A BBC-produced two-hour radio dramatization of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; was originally broadcast on Radio 4 on December 26, 1996. This adaptation was narrated by Dame Judi Dench, with Michael Maloney as Ged, and used a wide range of actors with different regional and social accents to emphasize the origins of the Earthsea characters (for instance, Estarriol and others from the East Reach were played by actors with Southern Welsh accents). The adaptation was subsequently released on audio cassette.

In April and May 2015, BBC Radio 4 aired a new, six-part dramatization of the &quot;Earthsea&quot; works, encompassing the storylines and motifs of the novels &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; and &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;. The first of the six 30 minute-long episodes premiered on April 27 and the last on May 5. The characters of Ged and Tenar were portrayed by three actors at different stages in their lives (Kasper Hilton-Hille, James McArdle and Shaun Dooley as Ged; Nishi Malde, Aysha Kala and Vineeta Rishi as Tenar). The radio drama was adapted by Judith Adams, directed by Sasha Yevtushenko and featured original music composed by Jon Nicholls. Following the premiere radio broadcast, each of the episodes were made available for online streaming on BBC Radio 4 Extra for a month, via the BBC iPlayer service. The adaptation was created and aired as part of a thematic month centered on the life and works of Ursula Le Guin, in commemoration of her then-recent 85th birthday. In addition to the &quot;Earthsea&quot; radio drama, the thematic month included the airing of a two-part radio adaptation of &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; earlier in April, as well as exclusive interviews with Le Guin and some of the writers she inspired.

===Television===

====Miniseries, 2004====

In December 2004, the U.S.-based Sci Fi Channel broadcast a three-hour loose adaptation of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; and &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; for television, entitled &quot;Legend of Earthsea&quot; (later, simply &quot;Earthsea&quot;). It was broadcast in two parts on Channel 4 in the UK at Easter 2005. Sci Fi Channel had angered Le Guin and fans of the Earthsea novels with its announcement that Ged and the vast majority of the other characters would be played by Caucasians and with the dramatis personæ posted on an official website. The latter revealed several original characters – such as &quot;The Archmagus&quot; and &quot;King Tygath&quot;, &quot;Diana&quot;, &quot;Penelope&quot;, and &quot;Marion&quot; – and it referred to &quot;Kargide&quot; characters rather than Kargad, Karg, or Kargish. The religious practices of Atuan were portrayed differently in the adaptation, and the celibacy of Earthsea wizards overlooked as Ged and Tenar become sexually involved. Referring to the writers of the show, Le Guin said &quot;I have blasted them for whitewashing Earthsea, and do not forgive them for it.&quot;

One month before the U.S. broadcast, Le Guin posted on her website &quot;A Reply to Some Statements Made by the Film-Makers&quot; published in the December 2004 issue of &quot;Sci Fi Magazine&quot;. She opened with the observation, &quot;I&#x27;ve tried very hard to keep from saying anything at all about this production, being well aware that movies must differ in many ways from the books they&#x27;re based on, and feeling that I really had no business talking about it, since I was not included in planning it and was given no part in discussions or decisions.&quot; (Director Robert Lieberman, too, had stated that she was not involved.)

&quot;That makes it particularly galling of the director to put words in my mouth.&quot; Le Guin disavowed some specific interpretations both by Lieberman and by executive director Robert Halmi Sr., and concluded (quoting Lieberman):
====Planned TV series====
In May 2018, it was announced that the series had been opted for a film adaptation by producer Jennifer Fox. In 2019, it was decided to produce a TV series instead.

Nothing has been heard of this proposed series since.

===Animated film, 2006===
Studio Ghibli&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; is loosely based in the Earthsea mythology. It was directed by Gorō Miyazaki, the son of Hayao Miyazaki. Le Guin granted Studio Ghibli the rights due to her love of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s films. Le Guin called the adaptation &quot;disappointing&quot; and &quot;entirely different&quot; from her creation.

<text>James &quot;Deaf&quot; Burke (8 December 1809 – 8 January 1845) was an English bare-knuckle boxer active from 1828 to 1843. He primarily competed in Southern England, though he also toured the United States from 1836 to 1838, fighting both exhibition matches and prizefights.

==Early life and boxing career==
James Burke was born on 8 December 1809 in St Giles, London. He was deaf from infancy and worked as a waterman on the River Thames before he began boxing professionally in 1828. He stood tall and weighed between and during his career. He was known by the nicknames &quot;Deaf Burke&quot; and &quot;the Deaf&#x27;un&quot;.

His first major fight was against Bill Fitzmaurice at Harpenden on 9 June 1829. Burke won the bout, which went for 166 rounds, lasting three hours. He fought ten additional opponents in various bouts between 1829 and 1833, including an 8 January 1833 fight which he won against Harry Macone, who stood tall and weighed .

==Burke versus Byrne==
In 1833, Burke challenged Simon Byrne, and they fought on 30 May 1833 at Nomansland Common, Hertfordshire. According to &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot;, each man staked £100 but an 1833 broadside published in Edinburgh claimed that each side staked £150. Burke was backed by boxers Tom Gaynor and Dick Curtis and trained with Thomas Owen at Northfleet. Byrne was backed by boxers Jem Ward, Tom Spring, and Ned Neale, training with the latter. Burke was favoured to win by 5–4 odds.

&quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot; claims that the fight went for ninety-nine rounds, lasting three hours and six minutes, but the Edinburgh broadside claims it lasted twenty-seven rounds, totalling seventy-five minutes. Both fighters drew blood during the first round. Burke was knocked down in the twenty-seventh round and vomited blood in the thirtieth round. Burke rallied in the forty-ninth round, and by the ninety-third round Byrne exhibited signs of exhaustion. Witnesses later recounted that both fighters had been carried to scratch at the start of some rounds, and that by the fight&#x27;s final rounds, neither man would have been able to get up from his own corner without being carried by his seconds, a practice later banned by the 1838 London Prize Ring Rules. In the ninety-ninth round, Byrne fell unconscious and could no longer stand. Burke was declared the victor, and Gaynor proclaimed that Burke was the &quot;Champion of England&quot;.

Byrne was carried to St Albans, where a surgeon attended to his wounds. His conditioned worsened the day after the fight. Leeches were applied to the bruised parts of his head and body. As his condition worsened, he was inspected by surgeon Astley Cooper, who determined that Byrne would not recover. Byrne died from injuries three days after the fight. Burke was charged with first-degree manslaughter, and Ward, Spring, Curtis, Gaynor, the umpires, and the referees were charged with second-degree manslaughter. Burke and Curtis were tried at the Hertford Assizes on 11 July 1833 but were acquitted and freed because the surgeon who had attended to Byrne was unable to determine if Byrne died from blows to the head or from the force of his exertions.

==Tour of the United States==
Burke struggled to find opponents in Britain after Byrne&#x27;s death. In 1833, he received a challenge from Irish boxer Sam O&#x27;Rourke to fight at the Curragh of County Kildare, but Burke refused to go to Ireland. He tried to arrange a fight with Young Dutch Sam for a £500 stake on each side, but Burke was unable to raise sufficient funds. He then tried to arrange a fight with Jem Ward for a £100 stake on each side, but Ward declined to fight for less than £200 per side.

Burke went to the United States in 1836. He fought against American boxers, including Jim Phelan and Abraham Vanderzee. Sam O&#x27;Rourke had gone to America in 1834, and he and Burke staged sparring exhibitions across the country. On 6 May 1837, Burke and O&#x27;Rourke fought a prizefight in New Orleans. O&#x27;Rourke was favoured by the local Irish population, and a riot broke out among some of the Irish spectators during the third round. Burke fled on horseback, pursued by an armed mob. Violence continued among the spectators until the mayor raised the militia to quell the violence.

Burke travelled to New York and appeared in local clubs and theatres. On 21 August 1837, he won a prizefight against Tom O&#x27;Connell at Hart Island. Three hundred spectators attended, paying $5 each for steamboat transport to the island. O&#x27;Connell was seconded by Abraham Vanderzee and Alexander Hamilton; Burke, by Jake Somerendyke and Bill Hatfield. Burke dominated from the first round and was declared the victor after the tenth round.

==Return to Britain==
Burke returned to Britain in 1838 and on 29 July issued a challenge to fight any man for the championship of England and a stake of either £100 or £500 a side. He also demanded that Jem Ward, who had retired, add his champions belt to the pot. William &quot;Bendigo&quot; Thompson accepted the challenge, and on 12 February 1839, the men arranged a fight regulated by the new London Prize Ring Rules for a total sum of £220 at Heather, Leicestershire. As many as 15,000 spectators attended. Burke was seconded by Jem Burn, King Dick, and Tommy Roundhead; Thompson, by Jim Ward, Nick Ward, and Peter Taylor. Thompson drew first blood in the third round, causing Burke&#x27;s nose to bleed. Burke was disqualified in the tenth round for headbutting Thompson twice, in violation of the new prize ring rules. Jem Ward presented Thompson with a champions belt. Burke initially spoke of rematch, but Thompson suffered a leg injury in March 1840, and did not box for several years.

Burke fought Nick Ward at Lillingstone Lovell, Oxfordshire, for a £100 prize on 22 September 1840. Ward drew blood in the first round, causing Burke&#x27;s cheek to bleed, but Burke also cut Ward&#x27;s lip later in the round. Ward fought cautiously, slowly, and defensively for the first four rounds. In the 17th round, Ward had Burke on the ropes and knocked him down. Burke&#x27;s seconds cried foul, and while the referee was making a decision and Burke was in his corner, Ward repeatedly struck Burke in face. Referee decided in Ward&#x27;s favour, and Ward won the fight, though Burke protested the outcome.

==Later life and death==
Burke retired from prize fighting after his defeat by Ward, and made a living teaching self-defence lessons. He came out of retirement to fight Bob Castles for a £50 prize on 13 June 1843. Burke won the bout after thirty-seven rounds, though he was infected with tuberculosis at the time.

Burke died of tuberculosis on 8 January 1845 at his home in Frances Street, Waterloo, London. He is buried in St John&#x27;s Church-yard, Waterloo. He was inducted to the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in 1992.

<text>Software configuration management (SCM), a.k.a. 
software change and configuration management (SCCM), is the software engineering practice of tracking and controlling changes to a software system; part of the larger cross-disciplinary field of configuration management (CM). SCM includes version control and the establishment of baselines.

==Goals==

The goals of SCM include:

* Configuration identification - Identifying configurations, configuration items and baselines.
* Configuration control - Implementing a controlled change process. This is usually achieved by setting up a change control board whose primary function is to approve or reject all change requests that are sent against any baseline.
* Configuration status accounting - Recording and reporting all the necessary information on the status of the development process.
* Configuration auditing - Ensuring that configurations contain all their intended parts and are sound with respect to their specifying documents, including requirements, architectural specifications and user manuals.
* Build management - Managing the process and tools used for builds.
* Process management - Ensuring adherence to the organization&#x27;s development process.
* Environment management - Managing the software and hardware that host the system.
* Teamwork - Facilitate team interactions related to the process.
* Defect tracking - Making sure every defect has traceability back to the source.

With the introduction of cloud computing and DevOps the purposes of SCM tools have become merged in some cases. The SCM tools themselves have become virtual appliances that can be instantiated as virtual machines and saved with state and version. The tools can model and manage cloud-based virtual resources, including virtual appliances, storage units, and software bundles. The roles and responsibilities of the actors have become merged as well with developers now being able to dynamically instantiate virtual servers and related resources.

<text>The ancestor of sendmail, delivermail, also by Eric Allman, is a mail transport agent that used the FTP protocol on the early ARPANET to transmit e-mail to the recipient. Due to deficiencies in using FTP to send e-mail, a new protocol was created in 1981 for sending e-mail, SMTP. After DNS replaced hosts files, DNS-style host names were also adopted.

In 1979, when &quot;delivermail&quot; was first shipped with 4.0BSD and 4.1BSD, the ARPANET was still using NCP as its network protocol. When the ARPANET switched to TCP/IP at the end of 1982, the road was paved for MTAs which used TCP to deliver e-mail; &quot;delivermail&quot; evolved into sendmail.

<text>Eric Paul Allman (born September 2, 1955) is an American computer programmer who developed sendmail and its precursor delivermail in the late 1970s and early 1980s at UC Berkeley. In 1998, Allman and Greg Olson co-founded the company Sendmail, Inc.

==Education and training==
Born in El Cerrito, California, Allman knew from an early age that he wanted to work in computing. He used to break into his high school&#x27;s mainframe and later used the UC Berkeley computing center for his computing needs. In 1973, he entered UC Berkeley, just as the Unix operating system began to become popular in academic circles. He earned B.S. and M.S. degrees from UC Berkeley in 1977 and 1980 respectively.

==Sendmail and Syslog==
As the Unix source code was available at Berkeley, the local hackers quickly made many extensions to the AT&amp;T code. One such extension was &quot;delivermail&quot;, which in 1981 turned into &quot;sendmail&quot;. As an MTA, it was designed to deliver email over the still relatively small (as compared to today&#x27;s Internet) ARPANET, which consisted of many smaller networks with vastly differing formats for e-mail headers.

Sendmail soon became an important part of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) and it used to be the most widely used MTA on Unix based systems, despite its somewhat complex configuration syntax and frequent abuse by Internet telemarketing firms. In 1998, Allman and Greg Olson founded &quot;Sendmail, Inc.&quot;, headquartered in Emeryville, California, to do proprietary work on improving &quot;sendmail&quot;.

The logging format used by the MTA, known as syslog, was at first used solely by sendmail, but eventually became an unofficial standard format used by other unrelated programs for logging. Later, this format was made official by in 2001; however, the original format has been made obsolete by the most recent revision, .

==Other contributions==
Allman is credited with popularizing the Allman indent style, also known as BSD indent style. He ported a Fortran version of Super Star Trek to the C programming language, which later became BSD Trek, and is still included in various Linux distributions as part of the classic bsdgames package.

He was awarded the Telluride Tech Festival Award of Technology in August, 2006 in Telluride, Colorado. In 2009 he was recognized as a Distinguished Engineer by the Association for Computing Machinery. In April 2014 he was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Allman, who is gay, lives in Berkeley, California, with Marshall Kirk McKusick, who had been his partner for more than 30 years before they got married in October 2013. The two first met in graduate school. McKusick is a lead developer of BSD.

<text>Giambattista Vico (born Giovan Battista Vico ; ; 23 June 1668 – 23 January 1744) was an Italian philosopher, rhetorician, historian, and jurist during the Italian Enlightenment. He criticized the expansion and development of modern rationalism, finding Cartesian analysis and other types of reductionism impractical to human life, and he was an apologist for classical antiquity and the Renaissance humanities, in addition to being the first expositor of the fundamentals of social science and of semiotics. He is recognised as one of the first Counter-Enlightenment figures in history.

The Latin aphorism &quot;&quot; (&quot;truth is itself something made&quot;) coined by Vico is an early instance of constructivist epistemology. He inaugurated the modern field of the philosophy of history, and, although the term &quot;philosophy of history&quot; is not in his writings, Vico spoke of a &quot;history of philosophy narrated philosophically.&quot; Although he was not an historicist, contemporary interest in Vico usually has been motivated by historicists, such as Isaiah Berlin, a philosopher and historian of ideas, Edward Said, a literary critic, and Hayden White, a metahistorian.

Vico&#x27;s intellectual &quot;magnum opus&quot; is the book &quot;Scienza Nuova&quot; or &quot;New Science&quot; (1725), which attempts a systematic organization of the humanities as a single science that records and explains the historical cycles by which societies rise and fall.

==Biography==

Born to a bookseller in Naples, Italy, Giovan Battista Vico attended several schools, but ill health and dissatisfaction with the scholasticism of the Jesuits led to his being educated at home by tutors. Evidence from his autobiographical work indicates that Vico likely was an autodidact educated under paternal influence, during a three-year absence from school, consequence of an accidental fall when the boy was seven years old. Giovan Battista&#x27;s formal education was at the University of Naples from which he graduated in 1694, as Doctor of Civil and Canon Law.

In 1686, after surviving a bout of typhus, he accepted a job as a tutor, in Vatolla, south of Salerno, which became a nine-year professional engagement that lasted till 1695. Four years later, in 1699, Vico married Teresa Caterina Destito, a childhood friend, and accepted a chair in rhetoric at the University of Naples, which he held until ill-health retirement, in 1741. Throughout his academic career, Vico would aspire to, but never attain, the more respectable chair of jurisprudence; however, in 1734, he was appointed historiographer royal, by Charles III, King of Naples, at a salary greater than he had earned as a university professor.

==The rhetoric and humanism of Vico==

Vico&#x27;s version of rhetoric is a product of his humanistic and pedagogic concerns. In the 1708 commencement speech &quot;De Nostri Temporis Studiorum Ratione&quot; (&quot;On the Order of the Scholarly Disciplines of Our Times&quot;), Vico said that whoever &quot;intends a career in public life, whether in the courts, the senate, or the pulpit&quot; should be taught to &quot;master the art of topics and [to] defend both sides of a controversy, be it on Nature, Man, or politics, in a freer and brighter style of expression, so he can learn to draw on those arguments which are most probable and have the greatest degree of verisimilitude&quot;; yet, in &quot;Scienza Nuova&quot;, Vico denounced defending both sides in controversies as &quot;false eloquence&quot;.

As Royal Professor of Latin Eloquence, Vico prepared students for higher studies in the fields of Law and of Jurisprudence; thus, his lessons were about the formal aspects of the canon of rhetoric, including the arrangement and the delivery of an argument. Yet he chose to emphasize the Aristotelian connection of rhetoric with logic and dialectic, thereby placing ends (rhetoric) at their center. Vico&#x27;s objection to modern rhetoric is that it is disconnected from common sense (&quot;sensus communis&quot;), defined as the &quot;worldly sense&quot; that is common to all men.

In lectures and throughout the body of his work, Vico&#x27;s rhetoric begins from a central argument (&quot;medius terminus&quot;), which is to be clarified by following the order of things as they arise in our experience. Probability and circumstance retain their proportionate importance, and discovery—reliant upon topics (&quot;loci&quot;)—supersedes axioms derived through reflective, abstract thought. In the tradition of classical Roman rhetoric, Vico sets out to educate the orator (rhetorician) as the transmitter of the &quot;oratio&quot;, a speech with &quot;ratio&quot; (reason) at the centre. What is essential to the oratorical art (Gr. ῥητορική, &quot;rhētorikē&quot;) is the orderly link between common sense and an end commensurate with oratory; an end that is not imposed upon the imagination from above (in the manner of the moderns and dogmatic Christianity), but that is drawn from common sense, itself. In the tradition of Socrates and Cicero, Vico&#x27;s true orator will be midwife to the birth of &quot;the true&quot; (as an idea) from &quot;the certain&quot;, the ignorance in the mind of the student.

Rediscovery of &quot;the most ancient wisdom&quot; of the senses, a wisdom that is &quot;humana stultitia&quot; (&quot;human foolishness&quot;), Vico&#x27;s emphases on the importance of civic life and of professional obligations are in the humanist tradition. He would call for a maieutic oratory art against the grain of the modern privilege of the dogmatic form of reason, in what he called the &quot;geometrical method&quot; of René Descartes and the logicians at the Port-Royal-des-Champs abbey.

==Response to the Cartesian method==

As he relates in his autobiography, Vico returned to Naples from Vatolla to find &quot;the physics of Descartes at the height of its renown among the established men of letters.&quot; Developments in both metaphysics and the natural sciences abounded as the result of Cartesianism. Widely disseminated by the Port Royal Logic of Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, Descartes&#x27;s method was rooted in verification: the only path to truth, and thus knowledge, was through axioms derived from observation. Descartes&#x27;s insistence that the &quot;sure and indubitable&quot; (or, &quot;clear and distinct&quot;) should form the basis of reasoning had an obvious impact on the prevailing views of logic and discourse. Studies in rhetoric—indeed all studies concerned with civic discourse and the realm of probable truths—met with increasing disdain.

Vico&#x27;s humanism and professional concerns prompted an obvious response that he would develop throughout the course of his writings: the realms of verifiable truth and human concern share only a slight overlap, yet reasoning is required in equal measure in both spheres. One of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the &quot;De Italorum Sapientia&quot;, where Vico argues that

Vico&#x27;s position here and in later works is not that the Cartesian method is irrelevant, but that its application cannot be extended to the civic sphere. Instead of confining reason to a string of verifiable axioms, Vico suggests (along with the ancients) that appeals to &quot;phronēsis&quot; (φρόνησις or practical wisdom) must also be made, and likewise appeals to the various components of persuasion that comprise rhetoric. Vico would reproduce this argument consistently throughout his works, and would use it as a central of the &quot;Scienza Nuova&quot;.

==The principle of &quot;Verum factum&quot;==
Vico is best known for his &quot;verum factum&quot; principle, first formulated in 1710 as part of his &quot;De antiquissima Italorum sapientia, ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda&quot; (1710) (&quot;Of the most ancient wisdom of the Italians, unearthed from the origins of the Latin language&quot;). The principle states that truth is verified through creation or invention and not, as per Descartes, through observation: &quot;The criterion and rule of the true is to have made it. Accordingly, our clear and distinct idea of the mind cannot be a criterion of the mind itself, still less of other truths. For while the mind perceives itself, it does not make itself.&quot; This criterion for truth would later shape the history of civilization in Vico&#x27;s opus, the &quot;Scienza Nuova&quot; (&quot;The New Science&quot;, 1725), because he would argue that civil life—like mathematics—is wholly constructed.

==The &quot;Scienza Nuova&quot;==
&quot;The New Science&quot; (1725, &quot;Scienza Nuova&quot;) is Vico&#x27;s major work. It has been highly influential in the philosophy of history, and for historicists such as Isaiah Berlin and Hayden White.

==Influence==
Samuel Beckett&#x27;s first published work, in the selection of critical essays on James Joyce entitled &quot;Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress&quot;, is &quot;Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce&quot;. In it, Beckett sees a profound influence of Vico&#x27;s philosophy and poetics—as well the cyclical form of the &quot;Scienza Nuova&quot;—on the avant-garde compositions of Joyce, and especially the titular Work in Progress, viz. &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

In &quot;Knowledge and Social Structure&quot; (1974), Peter Hamilton identified Vico as the &quot;sleeping partner&quot; of the Age of Enlightenment. Despite having been relatively unknown in his 18th-century time, and read only in his native Naples, the ideas of Vico are predecessors to the ideas of the intellectuals of the Enlightenment. Moreover, recognition of Vico&#x27;s intellectual influence began in the 19th century, when the French Romantic historians used his works as methodological models and guides.

In &quot;Capital: Critique of Political Economy&quot; (1867), Karl Marx&#x27;s mention of Vico indicates their parallel perspectives about history, the role of historical actors, and an historical method of narrative. Marx and Vico saw social-class warfare as the means by which men achieve the end of equal rights; Vico called that time the &quot;Age of Men&quot;. Marx concluded that such a state of affairs is the optimal end of social change in a society, but Vico thought that such complete equality of rights would lead to socio-political chaos and the consequent collapse of society. In that vein, Vico proposed a social need for religion, for a supernatural divine providence to keep order in human society.

In &quot;Orientalism&quot; (1978), Edward Said acknowledged his scholar&#x27;s debt to Vico, whose &quot;ideas anticipate and later infiltrate the line of German thinkers I am about to cite. They belong to the era of Herder and Wolff, later to be followed by Goethe, Humboldt, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, and finally the great twentieth century Romance philologists Erich Auerbach, Leo Spitzer, and Ernst Robert Curtius.&quot; As a humanist and early philologist, Vico represented &quot;a different, alternative model that has been extremely important to me in my work&quot;, which differed from mainstream Western prejudice against the Orient and the dominating &quot;standardization&quot; that came with modernity and culminated in National Socialism. That the interdependence of human history and culture facilitates the scholars&#x27; task to &quot;take seriously Vico&#x27;s great observation that men make their own history, that what they can know is what they have made, and extend it to geography. As geographical and cultural entities—to say nothing of historical entities—such locales, regions, and geographical sectors as &#x27;Orient&#x27; and &#x27;Occident&#x27; are man-made.&quot;

<text>A hydrometer or lactometer is an instrument used for measuring density or relative density of liquids based on the concept of buoyancy. They are typically calibrated and graduated with one or more scales such as specific gravity.

A hydrometer usually consists of a sealed hollow glass tube with a wider bottom portion for buoyancy, a ballast such as lead or mercury for stability, and a narrow stem with graduations for measuring. The liquid to test is poured into a tall container, often a graduated cylinder, and the hydrometer is gently lowered into the liquid until it floats freely. The point at which the surface of the liquid touches the stem of the hydrometer correlates to relative density. Hydrometers can contain any number of scales along the stem corresponding to properties correlating to the density.

Hydrometers are calibrated for different uses, such as a lactometer for measuring the density (creaminess) of milk, a saccharometer for measuring the density of sugar in a liquid, or an alcoholometer for measuring higher levels of alcohol in spirits.

The hydrometer makes use of Archimedes&#x27; principle: a solid suspended in a fluid is buoyed by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged part of the suspended solid. The lower the density of the fluid, the deeper a hydrometer of a given weight sinks; the stem is calibrated to give a numerical reading.

==History==
thumb|upright=0.6|Hydrometer from &quot;Practical Physics&quot;

The hydrometer probably dates back to the Greek philosopher Archimedes (3rd century BC) who used its principles to find the density of various liquids. An early description of a hydrometer comes from a Latin poem, written in the 2nd century AD by Remnius, who compared the use of a hydrometer to the method of fluid displacement used by Archimedes to determine the gold content of Hiero II&#x27;s crown.

Hypatia of Alexandria 370; d.415 CE), an important female Greek mathematician, is the first person traditionally associated with the hydrometer. In a letter, Synesius of Cyrene asks Hypatia, his teacher, to make a hydrometer for him:
The instrument in question is a cylindrical tube, which has the shape of a flute and is about the same size. It has notches in a perpendicular line, by means of which we are able to test the weight of the waters. A cone forms a lid at one of the extremities, closely fitted to the tube. The cone and the tube have one base only. This is called the baryllium. Whenever you place the tube in water, it remains erect. You can then count the notches at your ease, and in this way ascertain the weight of the water.
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science&quot;, it was used by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the 11th century and described by Al-Khazini in the 12th century. It was rediscovered in 1612 by Galileo and his circle of friends, and used in experiments especially at the Accademia del Cimento. It appeared again in the 1675 work of Robert Boyle (who coined the name &quot;hydrometer&quot;), with types devised by Antoine Baumé (the Baumé scale), William Nicholson, and Jacques Alexandre César Charles in the late 18th century, more or less contemporarily with Benjamin Sikes&#x27; discovery of the device by which the alcoholic content of a liquid can be automatically determined. The use of the Sikes device was made obligatory by British law in 1818.

==Ranges==
The hydrometer sinks deeper in low-density liquids such as kerosene, gasoline, and alcohol, and less deep in high-density liquids such as brine, milk, and acids. It is usual for hydrometers to be used with dense liquids to have the mark 1.000 (for water) near the top of the stem, and those for use with lighter liquids to have 1.000 near the bottom. In many industries a set of hydrometers is used (1.0–0.95, 0.95–.) to have instruments covering the range of specific gravities that may be encountered.

==Scales==

Modern hydrometers usually measure specific gravity but different scales were (and sometimes still are) used in certain industries. Examples include:

* API gravity, universally used worldwide by the petroleum industry.
* Baumé scale, formerly used in industrial chemistry and pharmacology
* Brix scale, primarily used in fruit juice, wine making and the sugar industry
* Oechsle scale, used for measuring the density of grape must
* Plato scale, primarily used in brewing
* Twaddell scale, formerly used in the bleaching and dyeing industries

==Specialized hydrometers==
Specialized hydrometers are frequently named for their use: a lactometer, for example, is a hydrometer designed especially for use with dairy products. They are sometimes referred to by this specific name, sometimes as hydrometers.

===Alcoholometer===
An alcoholmeter is a hydrometer that indicates the alcoholic strength of liquids which are essentially a mixture of alcohol and water. It is also known as a &quot;proof and Tralles hydrometer&quot; (after Johann Georg Tralles, but commonly misspelled as traille and tralle). It measures the density of the fluid. Where no sugar or other dissolved substances are present, the specific gravity of a solution of ethanol in water can be directly correlated to the concentration of alcohol. Saccharometers for measuring sugar-water mixtures measure densities greater than water. Many have scales marked with volume percents of &quot;potential alcohol&quot;, based on a pre-calculated specific gravity. A higher &quot;potential alcohol&quot; reading on this scale is caused by a greater specific gravity, assumed to be caused by the introduction of dissolved sugars or carbohydrate based material. A reading is taken before and after fermentation and approximate alcohol content is determined by subtracting the post fermentation reading from the pre-fermentation reading.

These were important instruments for determining tax, and specific maker&#x27;s instruments could be specified. Bartholomew Sikes had a monopoly in the UK and Mary Dicas and her family enjoyed a similar monopoly in the US.

===Lactometer===
A lactometer is used to check purity of cow&#x27;s milk. The specific gravity of milk does not give a conclusive indication of its composition since milk contains a variety of substances that are either heavier or lighter than water. Additional tests for fat content are necessary to determine overall composition. The instrument is graduated into a hundred parts. Milk is poured in and allowed to stand until the cream has formed, then the depth of the cream deposit in degrees determines the quality of the milk. If the milk sample is pure, the lactometer floats higher than if it is adulterated or impure.

===Saccharometer===
A saccharometer is a type of hydrometer used for determining the amount of sugar in a solution, invented by Thomas Thomson. It is used primarily by winemakers and brewers, and it can also be used in making sorbets and ice-creams. The first brewers&#x27; saccharometer was constructed by Benjamin Martin (with distillation in mind), and initially used for brewing by James Baverstock Sr in 1770. Henry Thrale adopted its use and it was later popularized by John Richardson in 1784.

It consists of a large weighted glass bulb with a thin stem rising from the top with calibrated markings. The sugar level can be determined by reading the value where the surface of the liquid crosses the scale. The higher the sugar content, the denser the solution, and thus the higher the bulb will float.

===Thermohydrometer===
A thermohydrometer is a hydrometer that has a thermometer enclosed in the float section. For measuring the density of petroleum products, such as fuel oils, the specimen is usually heated in a temperature jacket with a thermometer placed behind it since density is dependent on temperature. Light oils are placed in cooling jackets, typically at 15 °C.
Very light oils with many volatile components are measured in a variable volume container using a floating piston sampling device to minimize light end losses.

===Battery hydrometer===
The state of charge of a lead-acid battery can be estimated from the density of the sulfuric acid solution used as electrolyte. A hydrometer calibrated to read specific gravity relative to water at is a standard tool for servicing automobile batteries. Tables are used to correct the reading to the standard temperature. Hydrometers are also used for maintenance of wet-cell nickel-cadmium batteries to ensure the electrolyte is of the proper strength for the application; for this battery chemistry the specific gravity of the electrolyte is not related to the state of charge of the battery.

A battery hydrometer with thermometer (thermohydrometer) measures the temperature-compensated specific gravity and electrolyte temperature.

===Antifreeze tester===
Another automotive use of hydrometers is testing the quality of the antifreeze solution used for engine cooling. The degree of freeze protection can be related to the density (and so concentration) of the antifreeze; different types of antifreeze have different relations between measured density and freezing point.

===Acidometer===
An acidometer, or acidimeter, is a hydrometer used to measure the specific gravity of an acid.

===Barkometer===
A barkometer is calibrated to test the strength of tanning liquors used in tanning leather.

===Salinometer===
A salinometer is a hydrometer used to measure the salt content of the feed water to a marine steam boiler.

===Urinometer===
A urinometer is a medical hydrometer designed for urinalysis. As urine&#x27;s specific gravity is dictated by its ratio of solutes (wastes) to water, a urinometer makes it possible to quickly assess a patient&#x27;s overall level of hydration.

==Use in soil analysis==
A hydrometer analysis is the process by which fine-grained soils, silts and clays, are graded. Hydrometer analysis is performed if the grain sizes are too small for sieve analysis. The basis for this test is Stokes&#x27; Law for falling spheres in a viscous fluid in which the terminal velocity of fall depends on the grain diameter and the densities of the grain in suspension and of the fluid. The grain diameter thus can be calculated from a knowledge of the distance and time of fall. The hydrometer also determines the specific gravity (or density) of the suspension, and this enables the fraction of particles of a certain equivalent particle diameter to be calculated.

<doc id="165198" wikidata="Q1464943" url="?curid=165198" title="Wind speed">
<text>In meteorology, wind speed, or wind flow speed, is a fundamental atmospheric quantity caused by air moving from high to low pressure, usually due to changes in temperature. Wind speed is now commonly measured with an anemometer.

Wind speed affects weather forecasting, aviation and maritime operations, construction projects, growth and metabolism rates of many plant species, and has countless other implications. Wind direction is usually almost parallel to isobars (and not perpendicular, as one might expect), due to Earth&#x27;s rotation.

== Units ==
The meter per second (m/s) is the SI unit for velocity and the unit recommended by the World Meteorological Organization for reporting wind speeds, and used amongst others in weather forecasts in the Nordic countries. Since 2010 the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) also recommends meters per second for reporting wind speed when approaching runways, replacing their former recommendation of using kilometers per hour (km/h).

For historical reasons, other units such as miles per hour (mph), knots (kn), and feet per second (ft/s) are also sometimes used to measure wind speeds. Historically, wind speeds have also been classified using the Beaufort scale, which is based on visual observations of specifically defined wind effects at sea or on land.

==Factors affecting wind speed==
Wind speed is affected by a number of factors and situations, operating on varying scales (from micro to macro scales). These include the pressure gradient, Rossby waves, jet streams, and local weather conditions. There are also links to be found between wind speed and wind direction, notably with the pressure gradient and terrain conditions.

The Pressure gradient describes the difference in air pressure between two points in the atmosphere or on the surface of the Earth. It is vital to wind speed, because the greater the difference in pressure, the faster the wind flows (from the high to low pressure) to balance out the variation. The pressure gradient, when combined with the Coriolis effect and friction, also influences wind direction.

Rossby waves are strong winds in the upper troposphere. These operate on a global scale and move from west to east (hence being known as westerlies). The Rossby waves are themselves a different wind speed from that experienced in the lower troposphere.

Local weather conditions play a key role in influencing wind speed, as the formation of hurricanes, monsoons, and cyclones as freak weather conditions can drastically affect the flow velocity of the wind.

==Highest speed==

===Non-tornadic===
The fastest wind speed not related to tornadoes ever recorded was during the passage of Tropical Cyclone Olivia on 10 April 1996: an automatic weather station on Barrow Island, Australia, registered a maximum wind gust of The wind gust was evaluated by the WMO Evaluation Panel, who found that the anemometer was mechanically sound and that the gust was within statistical probability and ratified the measurement in 2010. The anemometer was mounted 10 m above ground level (and thus 64 m above sea level). During the cyclone, several extreme gusts of greater than were recorded, with a maximum 5-minute mean speed of ; the extreme gust factor was on the order of 2.27–2.75 times the mean wind speed. The pattern and scales of the gusts suggest that a mesovortex was embedded in the already-strong eyewall of the cyclone.

Currently, the second-highest surface wind speed ever officially recorded is at the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Observatory above sea level in the US on 12 April 1934, using a hot-wire anemometer. The anemometer, specifically designed for use on Mount Washington, was later tested by the US National Weather Bureau and confirmed to be accurate.

===Tornadic===
Wind speeds within certain atmospheric phenomena (such as tornadoes) may greatly exceed these values but have never been accurately measured. Directly measuring these tornadic winds is rarely done, as the violent wind would destroy the instruments. A method of estimating speed is to use Doppler on Wheels or mobile Doppler weather radars to measure the wind speeds remotely. Using this method, a mobile radar (RaXPol) owned and operated by the University of Oklahoma recorded winds up to inside the 2013 El Reno tornado, marking the fastest winds ever observed by radar in history. In 1999, a mobile radar measured winds up to during the 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado in Oklahoma on 3 May, although another figure of has also been quoted for the same tornado. Yet another number used by the Center for Severe Weather Research for that measurement is . However, speeds measured by Doppler weather radar are not considered official records.

===On other planets===
Wind speeds can be much higher on exoplanets. Scientists at the University of Warwick in 2015 determined that HD 189733b has winds of . In a press release, the University announced that the methods used from measuring HD 189733b&#x27;s wind speeds could be used to measure wind speeds on Earth-like exoplanets.

== Measurement ==
An anemometer is one of the tools used to measure wind speed. A device consisting of a vertical pillar and three or four concave cups, the anemometer captures the horizontal movement of air particles (wind speed).

Unlike traditional cup-and-vane anemometers, ultrasonic wind sensors have no moving parts and are therefore used to measure wind speed in applications that require maintenance-free performance, such as atop wind turbines. As the name suggests, ultrasonic wind sensors measure the wind speed using high-frequency sound. An ultrasonic anemometer has two or three pairs of sound transmitters and receivers. Each transmitter constantly beams high-frequency sound to its receiver. Electronic circuits inside measure the time it takes for the sound to make its journey from each transmitter to the corresponding receiver. Depending on how the wind blows, some of the sound beams will be affected more than the others, slowing it down or speeding it up very slightly. The circuits measure the difference in speeds of the beams and use that to calculate how fast the wind is blowing.

Acoustic resonance wind sensors are a variant of the ultrasonic sensor. Instead of using time of flight measurement, acoustic resonance sensors use resonating acoustic waves within a small purpose-built cavity. Built into the cavity is an array of ultrasonic transducers, which are used to create the separate standing-wave patterns at ultrasonic frequencies. As wind passes through the cavity, a change in the wave&#x27;s property occurs (phase shift). By measuring the amount of phase shift in the received signals by each transducer, and then by mathematically processing the data, the sensor is able to provide an accurate horizontal measurement of wind speed and direction.

Another tool used to measure wind velocity includes a GPS combined with pitot tube. A fluid flow velocity tool, the Pitot tube is primarily used to determine the air velocity of an aircraft.

==Design of structures==

Wind speed is a common factor in the design of structures and buildings around the world. It is often the governing factor in the required lateral strength of a structure&#x27;s design.

In the United States, the wind speed used in design is often referred to as a &quot;3-second gust&quot;, which is the highest sustained gust over a 3-second period having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50 (ASCE 7-05, updated to ASCE 7-16). This design wind speed is accepted by most building codes in the United States and often governs the lateral design of buildings and structures.

In Canada, reference wind pressures are used in design and are based on the &quot;mean hourly&quot; wind speed having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50. The reference wind pressure is calculated using the equation , where is the air density and is the wind speed.

Historically, wind speeds have been reported with a variety of averaging times (such as fastest mile, 3-second gust, 1-minute, and mean hourly) which designers may have to take into account. To convert wind speeds from one averaging time to another, the Durst Curve was developed, which defines the relation between probable maximum wind speed averaged over some number of seconds to the mean wind speed over one hour.

<doc id="165200" wikidata="Q697037" url="?curid=165200" title="Combined Fleet">
<text>The was the main sea-going component of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Until 1933, the Combined Fleet was not a permanent organization, but a temporary force formed for the duration of a conflict or major naval maneuvers from various units normally under separate commands in peacetime.

==History==

===Sino-Japanese War (1894–95)===
The Combined Fleet was formally created for the first time on 18 July 1894 by the merger of the Standing Fleet and the Western Fleet. The Standing Fleet (also known as the Readiness Fleet) contained the navy&#x27;s most modern and combat-capable warships. The Western Fleet was a reserve force consisting primarily of obsolete ships deemed unsuitable for front-line combat operations, but still suitable for commerce protection and coastal defense. Vice-admiral Itō Sukeyuki was appointed the first Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet for the duration of the first Sino-Japanese War against China.

===Russo-Japanese War (1904–05)===

The Combined Fleet was re-formed during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 to provide a unified overall command for the three separate fleets in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The 1st Fleet was the main battleship force, which formed the backbone of the navy and was intended to be used in a traditional line of battle showdown with an equivalent enemy battleship fleet (&quot;Kantai Kessen&quot;). The 2nd Fleet was a fast, mobile strike force with armored cruisers and protected cruisers. The 3rd Fleet was primarily a reserve fleet of obsolete vessels considered too weak for front-line combat service, but which could still be used in the operation to blockade Port Arthur. Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō was commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet during the Russo-Japanese War.

===Interwar years===
The Combined Fleet was not maintained as a permanent organization, but was temporarily created when necessary during fleet maneuvers or when called for by extraordinary circumstances. Thus, during the period from 1905 to 1924, the Combined Fleet was created only sporadically as the occasion or circumstances dictated, and disbanded immediately afterwards.

In 1924, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared in an edict on fleet organization that &quot;for the time being&quot; the Combined Fleet would be a standing organization consisting of the IJN 1st Fleet and IJN 2nd Fleet. As this was not intended to be &quot;permanent&quot; and since the commander of IJN 1st Fleet concurrently directed the Combined Fleet, the Combined Fleet was not given a Headquarters staff of its own.

From 1933, with the Mukden Incident and the increasing tension with China, a permanent HQ staff for the Combined Fleet was established. By the late 1930s, it included most of Japan&#x27;s warships—only the base units, the Special Naval Landing Forces, and the China Area Fleet lay outside the Combined Fleet.

===World War II===

The Combined Fleet came under direct command of the Imperial General Headquarters in 1937. With the start of the Pacific War with the attack on Pearl Harbor carried out by Combined Fleet&#x27;s &quot;Kido Butai&quot; (1st Air Fleet), the Combined Fleet became almost synonymous with the Imperial Japanese Navy, under the command of admiral Isoroku Yamamoto till April 1943 when he died after his plane was shot-down by US air forces over Bougainville Island. It comprised the battleships, aircraft carriers, aircraft, and the components that made up the main fighting strength of the IJN. It was first mobilized on the whole for the Battle of Midway. After the devastating carrier losses at Midway and in the Solomon Islands campaign, the navy re-organized into a number of &quot;Area Fleets&quot; for local operational control of various geographic zones. The Combined Fleet then evolved into more of an administrative organization.

As the war situation deteriorated for the Japanese and the territories controlled by the &quot;Area Fleets&quot; fell one after another to the United States Navy, the Imperial General Headquarters and the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff acted to force the American fleet into a &quot;decisive battle&quot; in the Philippines per the &quot;Kantai Kessen&quot; philosophy. In the resultant Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf the Japanese fleet was severely depleted. The remnants of the Combined Fleet fled to Okinawa, but further operations were hindered by lack of fuel and air cover. By the time of the final suicide mission of the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; in Operation Ten-Go, the Combined Fleet had ceased to exist as an effective combat force.

<text>The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is an independent agency of the United States government tasked with protecting public health and safety related to nuclear energy. Established by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the NRC began operations on January 19, 1975, as one of two successor agencies to the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Its functions include overseeing reactor safety and security, administering reactor licensing and renewal, licensing and oversight for fuel cycle facilities, licensing radioactive materials, radionuclide safety, and managing the storage, security, recycling, and disposal of spent fuel.

==History==

Prior to 1975 the Atomic Energy Commission was in charge of matters regarding radionuclides. The AEC was dissolved, because it was perceived as unduly favoring the industry it was charged with regulating. The NRC was formed as an independent commission to oversee nuclear energy matters, oversight of nuclear medicine, and nuclear safety and security.

The U.S. AEC became the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1975, responsible for development and oversight of nuclear weapons. Research and promotion of civil uses of radioactive materials, such as for nuclear non-destructive testing, nuclear medicine, and nuclear power, was split into the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science &amp; Technology within ERDA by the same act. In 1977, ERDA became the United States Department of Energy (DOE). In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration was created as a subcomponent of DOE, responsible for nuclear weapons.

Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, the NRC developed a guidance strategy known as &quot;Diverse and Flexible Coping Strategies (FLEX)&quot; which requires licensee nuclear power plants to account for beyond-design-basis external events (seismic, flooding, high-winds, etc.) that are most
impactful to reactor safety through loss of power and loss of ultimate heat sink. FLEX Strategies have been implemented at all operating nuclear power plants in the United States.

The origins and development of NRC regulatory processes and policies are explained in five volumes of history published by the University of California Press. These are:
* &quot;Controlling the Atom: The Beginnings of Nuclear Regulation 1946–1962&quot; (1984).
* &quot;Containing the Atom: Nuclear Regulation in a Changing Environment, 1963–1971&quot; (1992).
* &quot;Permissible Dose: A History of Radiation Protection in the Twentieth Century&quot; (2000)
* &quot;Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective&quot; (2004)
* &quot;The Road to Yucca Mountain: The Development of Radioactive Waste Policy in the United States&quot; (2009).

The NRC has produced a booklet, &quot;A Short History of Nuclear Regulation 1946–2009&quot;, which outlines key issues in NRC history. Thomas Wellock, a former academic, is the NRC historian. Before joining the NRC, Wellock wrote &quot;Critical Masses: Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958–1978&quot;.

==Mission and commissioners==
The NRC protects public health and safety and advances the nation’s common defense and security by enabling the safe and secure use and deployment of civilian nuclear energy technologies and radioactive materials through efficient and reliable licensing, oversight, and regulation for the benefit of society and the environment.
The NRC&#x27;s regulatory mission covers three main areas:
* &quot;Reactors&quot; – Commercial reactors for generating electric power and research and test reactors used for research, testing, and training
* &quot;Materials&quot; – Uses of nuclear materials in medical, industrial, and academic settings and facilities that produce nuclear fuel
* &quot;Waste&quot; – Transportation, storage, and disposal of nuclear materials and waste, and decommissioning of nuclear facilities from service.

The NRC is headed by five commissioners appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate for five-year terms. One of them is designated by the president to be the chairman and official spokesperson of the commission. The chairman is the principal executive officer of the NRC, who exercise all of the executive and administrative functions of the commission.

The current chairman is David A. Wright. President Trump designated Wright as chairman of the NRC effective January 20, 2025.

==Organization==
The NRC consists of the commission on the one hand and offices of the executive director for Operations on the other.
The commission is divided into two committees (Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes) and one Board, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, as well as eight commission staff offices (Office of Commission Appellate Adjudication, Office of Congressional Affairs, Office of the General Counsel, Office of International Programs, Office of Public Affairs, Office of the Secretary, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Executive Director for Operations).

Christopher T. Hanson is the chairman of the NRC. There are 14 Executive Director for Operations offices:
Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, Office of Enforcement, which investigates reports by nuclear power whistleblowers, specifically the Allegations Program, Office of Investigations, Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response, Region I, Region II, Region III, Region IV, Office of the Chief Information Officer, Office of Administration, Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer, and Office of Small Business and Civil Rights.

Of these operations offices, NRC&#x27;s major program components are the first two offices mentioned above.

NRC&#x27;s proposed FY 2024 budget is $9.949 million, with 2897.9 full-time equivalents (FTE), 90 percent of which is recovered by fees. This is an increase of $5.1million, compared to FY 2023.

NRC headquarters offices are located in unincorporated North Bethesda, Maryland (although the mailing address for two of the three main buildings in the complex list the city as Rockville, MD), and there are four regional offices.

===Regions===

The NRC territory is broken down into four geographical regions; until the late 1990s, there was a Region V office in Walnut Creek, California which was absorbed into Region IV, and Region V was dissolved.

* Region I, located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, oversees the northeastern states.
* Region II, located in Atlanta, Georgia, oversees most of the southeastern states.
* Region III, located in Lisle, Illinois, oversees the Midwest.
* Region IV, located in Arlington, Texas, oversees the western and south central states.

In these four regions NRC oversees the operation of US nuclear reactors, namely 94 power-producing reactors, and 31 non-power-producing, or research and test reactors. Oversight is done on several levels. For example:

* Each power-producing reactor site has resident inspectors, who monitor day-to-day operations.
* Numerous special inspection teams, with many different specialties, routinely conduct inspections at each site.

=== Agreement States ===
Agreement States have entered into agreements with the NRC that give them the authority to license and inspect byproduct, source, or special nuclear materials used or possessed within their borders. Any applicant, other than a Federal agency or Federally recognized Indian tribe, who wishes to possess or use licensed material in one of these Agreement States should contact the responsible officials in that State for guidance on preparing an application. These applications should be filed with State officials, not with the NRC.

==Recordkeeping system==
NRC has a library, which also contains online document collections. In 1984 it started an electronic repository called ADAMS, the Agencywide Documents Access and Management System, for its public inspection reports, correspondence, and other technical documents written by NRC staff, contractors, and licensees. It was upgraded in October 2010 and is now web-based. Of documents from 1980 to 1999 only some have abstracts and/or full text; most are citations. Documents from before 1980 are available in paper or microfiche formats. Copies of these older documents or classified documents can be applied for with a FOIA request.

==Training and accreditation==

NRC conducts audits and training inspections, observes the National Nuclear Accrediting Board meetings, and nominates some members.

The 1980 Kemeny Commission&#x27;s report after the Three Mile Island accident recommended that the nuclear energy industry &quot;set and police its own standards of excellence&quot;. The nuclear industry founded the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) within 9 months to establish personnel training and qualification. The industry through INPO created the &#x27;National Academy for Nuclear Training Program&#x27; either as early as 1980 or in September 1985 per the International Atomic Energy Agency. INPO refers to NANT as &quot;our National Academy for Nuclear Training&quot; on its website. NANT integrates and standardizes the training programs of INPO and US nuclear energy companies, offers training scholarships and interacts with the &#x27;National Nuclear Accrediting Board&#x27;. This Board is closely related to the National Academy for Nuclear Training, not a government body, and referred to as independent by INPO, the Nuclear Energy Institute, and nuclear utilities. but not by the NRC, all of whom are represented on the board.

The 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act directed NRC in Section 306 to issue regulations or &quot;other appropriate regulatory guidance&quot; on training of nuclear plant personnel. Since the nuclear industry already had developed training and accreditation, NRC issued a policy statement in 1985, endorsing the INPO program. NRC has a memorandum of agreement with INPO and &quot;monitors INPO activities by observing accreditation team visits and the monthly NNAB meetings&quot;.

In 1993, NRC endorsed the industry&#x27;s approach to training that had been used for nearly a decade through its &#x27;Training Rule&#x27;. In February 1994, NRC passed the &#x27;Operator Requalification Rule&#x27; 59 FR 5938, Feb. 9, 1994, allowing each nuclear power plant company to conduct the operator licensing renewal examination every six years, eliminating the requirement of NRC-administered written requalification examination.

In 1999, NRC issued a final rule on operator initial licensing examination, that allows companies to prepare, proctor, and grade their own operator initial licensing examinations. Facilities can &quot;upon written request&quot; continue to have the examinations prepared and administered by NRC staff, but if a company volunteers to prepare the examination, NRC continues to approve and administer it.

Since 2000 meetings between NRC and applicants or licensees have been open to the public.

==Prospective nuclear units==

Between 2007 and 2009, 13 companies applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for construction and operating licenses to build 25 new nuclear power reactors in the United States.
However, the case for widespread nuclear plant construction was eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies. Many license applications for proposed new reactors were suspended or cancelled. These will not be the cheapest energy options available, therefore not an attractive investment. In 2013, four reactors were permanently closed: San Onofre 2 and 3 in California, Crystal River 3 in Florida, and Kewaunee in Wisconsin. Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, was shut down on December 29, 2014. New York state eventually closed Indian Point Energy Center, in Buchanan, 30 miles from New York City, on April 30, 2021.

In 2019 the NRC approved a second 20-year license extension for Turkey Point units 3 and 4, the first time NRC had extended licenses to 80 years total lifetime. Similar extensions for about 20 reactors are planned or intended, with more expected in the future. This will reduce demand for replacement new builds.

== Controversy, concerns, and criticisms ==
Byrne and Hoffman wrote in 1996, that since the 1980s the NRC has generally favored the interests of nuclear industry, and been unduly responsive to industry concerns, while failing to pursue tough regulation. The NRC has often sought to hamper or deny public access to the regulatory process, and created new barriers to public participation.

Barack Obama, when running for president in 2007, said that the five-member NRC had become &quot;captive of the industries that it regulates&quot;.

Numerous different observers have criticized the NRC as an example of regulatory capture The NRC has been accused of having conflicting roles as regulator and &quot;salesman&quot; in a 2011 Reuters article, doing an inadequate job by the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the agency approval process has been called a &quot;rubber stamp&quot;.

Frank N. von Hippel wrote in March 2011, that despite the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, the NRC has often been too timid in ensuring that America&#x27;s commercial reactors are operated safely:

Nuclear power regulation is a textbook example of the problem of &quot;regulatory capture&quot; — in which an industry gains control of an agency meant to regulate it. Regulatory capture can be countered only by vigorous public scrutiny and Congressional oversight, but in the 32 years since Three Mile Island, interest in nuclear regulation has declined precipitously.
An article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists stated that many forms of NRC regulatory failure exist, including regulations ignored by the common consent of NRC and industry:

A worker (named George Galatis) at the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant in Connecticut kept warning management, that the spent fuel rods were being put too quickly into the spent storage pool and that the number of rods in the pool exceeded specifications. Management ignored him, so he went directly to the NRC, which eventually admitted that it knew of both of the forbidden practices, which happened at many plants, but chose to ignore them. The whistleblower was fired and blacklisted.
=== Terrorism concerns and threats ===

Terrorist attacks such as those executed by al-Qaeda on New York City and Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001, and in London on July 7, 2005, have prompted fears that extremist groups might use radioactive dirty bombs in further attacks in the United States and elsewhere.
In March 2007, undercover investigators from the Government Accountability Office set up a false company and obtained a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that would have allowed them to buy the radioactive materials needed for a dirty bomb. According to the GAO report, NRC officials did not visit the company or attempt to personally interview its executives. Instead, within 28 days, the NRC mailed the license to the West Virginia postal box. Upon receipt of the license, GAO officials were able to easily modify its stipulations and remove a limit on the amount of radioactive material they could buy. A spokesman for the NRC said that the agency considered the radioactive devices a &quot;lower-level threat&quot;; a bomb built with the materials could have contaminated an area about the length of a city block but would not have presented an immediate health hazard.

=== 1987 congressional report ===
Twelve years into NRC operations, a 1987 congressional report entitled &quot;NRC Coziness with Industry&quot; concluded, that the NRC &quot;has not maintained an arms length regulatory posture with the commercial nuclear power industry ... [and] has, in some critical areas, abdicated its role as a regulator altogether&quot;. To cite three examples:

A 1986 Congressional report found that NRC staff had provided valuable technical assistance to the utility seeking an operating license for the controversial Seabrook plant. In the late 1980s, the NRC &#x27;created a policy&#x27; of non-enforcement by asserting its discretion not to enforce license conditions; between September 1989 and 1994, the &#x27;NRC has either waived or chosen not to enforce regulations at nuclear power reactors over 340 times&#x27;. Finally, critics charge that the NRC has ceded important aspects of regulatory authority to the industry&#x27;s own Institute for Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), an organization formed by utilities in response to the Three Mile Island Accident.
=== Nuclear Reactor License Renewal Program ===
One example involves the license renewal program that NRC initiated to extend the operating licenses for the nation&#x27;s fleet of commercial nuclear reactors. Environmental impact statements (EIS) were prepared for each reactor to extend the operational period from 40 to 60 years. One study examined the EISs and found significant flaws, included failure to consider significant issues of concern. It also found that the NRC management had significantly underestimated the risk and consequences posed by a severe reactor accident such as a full-scale nuclear meltdown. NRC management asserted, without scientific evidence, that the risk of such accidents were so &quot;Small&quot; that the impacts could be dismissed and therefore no analysis of human and environmental was even performed. Such a conclusion is scientifically indefensible given the experience of the Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima accidents. Another finding was that NRC had concealed the risk posed to the public at large by disregarding one of the most important EIS requirements, mandating that cumulative impacts be assessed (40 Code of Federal Regulations §1508.7). By disregarding this basic requirement, NRC effectively misrepresented the risk posed to the nation by approximately two orders of magnitude (i.e., the true risk is about 100 greater than NRC represented). These findings were corroborated in a final report prepared by a special Washington State Legislature Nuclear Power Task Force, titled, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t NRC Address Consequences of Severe Accidents in EISs for re-licensing?&quot;

=== Post-Fukushima ===
In Vermont, the day before the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that damaged Japan&#x27;s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the NRC approved a 20-year extension for the license of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, although the Vermont state legislature voted overwhelmingly to deny an extension. The plant had been found to be leaking radioactive materials through a network of underground pipes, which Entergy had denied under oath even existed. At a hearing in 2009 Tony Klein, chairman of the Vermont House Natural Resources and Energy Committee had asked the NRC about the pipes and the NRC also did not know they existed.

In March 2011, the Union of Concerned Scientists released a study critical of the NRC&#x27;s 2010 performance as a regulator. The UCS said that over the years, it had found the NRC&#x27;s enforcement of safety rules has not been &quot;timely, consistent, or effective&quot; and it cited 14 &quot;near-misses&quot; at U.S. plants in 2010 alone.

In April 2011, Reuters reported that diplomatic cables showed NRC sometimes being used as a sales tool to help push American technology to foreign governments, when &quot;lobbying for the purchase of equipment made by Westinghouse Electric Company and other domestic manufacturers&quot;. This gives the appearance of a regulator which is acting in a commercial capacity, &quot;raising concerns about a potential conflict of interest&quot;.

San Clemente Green, an environmental group opposed to the continued operation of the San Onofre Nuclear Plant, said in 2011 that instead of being a watchdog, the NRC too often rules in favor of nuclear plant operators.

In 2011, the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami led to unprecedented damage and flooding of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The subsequent loss of offsite power and flooding of onsite emergency diesel generators led to loss of coolant and subsequent Nuclear meltdown of three reactor cores. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster led to an uncontrolled release of radioactive contamination, and forced the Japanese Government to evacuate approximately 100,000 citizens.

Gregory Jaczko was chairman of the NRC when the 2011 Fukushima disaster occurred in Japan. Jaczko looked for lessons for the US, and strengthened security regulations for nuclear power plants. For example, he supported the requirement that new plants be able to withstand an aircraft crash. On February 9, 2012, Jaczko cast the lone dissenting vote on plans to build the first new nuclear power plant in more than 30 years when the NRC voted 4–1 to allow Atlanta-based Southern Co to build and operate two new nuclear power reactors at its existing Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia. He cited safety concerns stemming from Japan&#x27;s 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, saying &quot;I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened&quot;. In July 2011, Mark Cooper said that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is &quot;on the defensive to prove it is doing its job of ensuring safety&quot;. In October 2011, Jaczko described &quot;a tension between wanting to move in a timely manner on regulatory questions, and not wanting to go too fast&quot;.

In 2011 Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, criticized the NRC&#x27;s response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and the decision-making on the proposed Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design.

In 2011, a total of 45 groups and individuals from across the nation formally asked the NRC to suspend all licensing and other activities at 21 proposed nuclear reactor projects in 15 states until the NRC completed a thorough post-Fukushima nuclear disaster examination:

 The petition seeks suspension of six existing reactor license renewal decisions (Columbia Generating Station, WA Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station, OH, Diablo Canyon Power Plant, CA, Indian Point Energy Center, NY, Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, MA, and Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, NH); 13 new reactor combined construction permit and operating license decisions (Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station Units 3 and 4, AL, Bell Bend, Callaway Nuclear Generating Station, MO, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Generating Station, MD, Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant, TX, Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, MI, Levy County Nuclear Power Plant, FL North Anna Nuclear Generating Station, VA, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, NC, South Texas Nuclear Generating Station, TX, Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station, FL, Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, GA, and William States Lee III Nuclear Generating Station, SC);a construction permit decision (Bellefonte Units 1 and 2); and an operating license decision (Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station, TN). In addition, the petition asks the NRC to halt proceedings to approve the standardized AP1000 and Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor designs.

The petitioners asked the NRC to supplement its own investigation by establishing an independent commission comparable to that set up in the wake of the less severe 1979 Three Mile Island accident. The petitioners included Public Citizen, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace.

=== Intentionally concealing reports concerning the risks of flooding ===
Following the Fukushima disaster, the NRC prepared a report in 2011 to examine the risk that dam failures posed on the nation&#x27;s fleet of nuclear reactors. A redacted version of NRC&#x27;s report on dam failures was posted on the NRC website on March 6. The original, un-redacted version was leaked to the public.

The un-redacted version which was leaked to the public highlights the threat that flooding poses to nuclear power plants located near large dams and substantiates claims that NRC management has intentionally misled the public for years about the severity of the flooding.

The leaked version of the report concluded that one-third of the U.S. nuclear fleet (34 plants) may face flooding hazards greater than they were designed to withstand. It also shows that NRC management was aware of some aspects of this risk for 15 years and yet it had done nothing to effectively address the problem. Some flooding events are so serious that they could result in a &quot;severe&quot; nuclear accident, up to, and including, a nuclear meltdown.

This criticism is corroborated by two NRC whistleblowers who accused their management of deliberately covering up information concerning the vulnerability of flooding, and of failing to take corrective actions despite being aware of these risks for years. Richard Perkins, a second risk engineer with the NRC and the lead author of the leaked report, filed a complaint with the agency&#x27;s Inspector General, asserting that NRC staff had improperly redacted information from the public version of his report &quot;to prevent the disclosure of this safety information to the public because it will embarrass the agency.&quot; Perkins wrote. &quot;Concurrently, the NRC concealed the information from the public.&quot;

Larry Criscione, a second NRC risk engineer also raised concerns about the NRC withholding information concerning the risk of flooding. He stated that assertions by NRC&#x27;s management that plants are &quot;currently able to mitigate flooding events,&quot; was false.

David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and safety advocate with the Union of Concerned Scientists: &quot;The redacted information shows that the NRC is lying to the American public about the safety of U.S. reactors,&quot;

The Oconee Nuclear Station has been shown to be at particular risk from flooding. An NRC letter dated 2009 states that &quot;a Jocassee Dam failure is a credible event&quot;. It goes on to state that &quot;NRC staff expressed concerns that Duke has not demonstrated that the [null Oconee Nuclear Station] units will be adequately protected.&quot;

NRC&#x27;s 2011 leaked report notes that &quot;dam failure incidents are common&quot;. NRC estimated the odds that dams constructed like Jocassee will fail is about 1 in 3,600 failures per year. Oconee is licensed to operate for another 20 years. The odds of the Jocassee Dam failing over that period are 1 in 180. NRC requires risks to be investigated if they have a frequency of more than 1 in 10,000 years. For a reactor operating over a period of 40 years, these risks must be evaluated if they have a chance greater than a 1 in 250 of occurring.

NRC identified 34 reactors that lie downstream from a total of more than 50 dams. More than half of these dams are roughly the size of the Jocassee dam. Assuming the NRC&#x27;s failure rate applies to all of these dams, the chance that one will fail over the next 40 years is about one in four or 25 percent chance. This dam failure rate does not include risks posed by earthquakes or terrorism. Thus, the true probability may be much higher.

This raised a second and potentially larger issue. NRC recently completed its license renewal program which extended the operating licenses of the nation&#x27;s fleet of nuclear reactors for an additional 20 years. NRC stated that the probability of a severe accident is so incredible that the consequences can be dismissed from the analysis of impacts in its relicensing environmental impact statements (EIS). Yet this conflicts with NRC&#x27;s internal analyses which concluded that flooding presented a serious human and environmental risk. Critics charge that if these relicensing EISs failed to evaluate the risks of flooding, then how can the public be confident that NRC did not mislead stakeholders concerning other risks such as the potential for a nuclear meltdown.

NRC officials stated in June 2011 that US nuclear safety rules do not adequately weigh the risk of a single event that would knock out electricity from the grid and from emergency generators, as a quake and tsunami did in Japan. , and NRC instructed agency staff to move forward with seven of the 12 safety recommendations put forward by a federal task force in July 2011. The recommendations include &quot;new standards aimed at strengthening operators&#x27; ability to deal with a complete loss of power, ensuring plants can withstand floods and earthquakes and improving emergency response capabilities&quot;. The new safety standards will take up to five years to fully implement.

, Jaczko warned power companies against complacency and said the agency must &quot;push ahead with new rules prompted by the nuclear crisis in Japan, while also resolving long-running issues involving fire protection and a new analysis of earthquake risks&quot;.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has also been criticized for its reluctance to allow for innovation and experimentation, even controlled for and purportedly safe methods of deploying nuclear power that countries such as Poland are approving before the United States. As reported by Reason magazine in May 2022: 

=== Exceeding powers licensing off-site interim storage facility ===
In September 2021 the NRC issued a license for a privately operated temporary consolidated interim storage facility (CISF) for spent nuclear fuel in Andrews County, Texas. However a group including the State of Texas, which had passed a law in 2022 prohibiting the storage of high-level waste in the state, petitioned for a court review of the license. In August 2023 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the NRC does not have the authority from Congress under the Atomic Energy Act or the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to license such a temporary storage facility that is not at a nuclear power station or federal site, nullifying the purported license. Another CISF in New Mexico is similarly being challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

<text>Schönbrunn Palace (Austrian German: Schloss Schönbrunn ; Viennese German: Schloss Scheenbrunn) was the main summer residence of the Habsburg rulers, located in Hietzing, the 13th district of Vienna. The name &quot;Schönbrunn&quot; (meaning &quot;beautiful spring&quot;) has its roots in an artesian well from which water was consumed by the court.

The 1,441-room Baroque palace is one of the most important architectural, cultural, and historic monuments in the country. The history of the palace and its vast gardens spans over 300 years, reflecting the changing tastes, interests, and aspirations of successive Habsburg monarchs. It has been a major tourist attraction since the mid-1950s.

== History ==
In 1569, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II purchased a large floodplain of the Wien river beneath a hill, situated between Meidling and Hietzing. The former owner, in 1548, had erected a mansion called &quot;Katterburg&quot;. The emperor ordered the area to be fenced and put game there such as pheasants, ducks, deer and boar, in order for it to serve as the court&#x27;s recreational hunting ground. In a small separate part of the area, &quot;exotic&quot; birds such as turkeys and peafowl were kept. Fishponds were also built.
During the next century, the area was used as a hunting and recreation ground. Eleonora Gonzaga, who loved hunting, spent much time there and was bequeathed the area as her widow&#x27;s residence after the death of her husband, Ferdinand II. From 1638 to 1643, she added a palace to the Katterburg mansion, while in 1642 came the first mention of the name &quot;Schönbrunn&quot; on an invoice. The origins of the Schönbrunn orangery seem to go back to Eleonora Gonzaga as well. The Schönbrunn Palace in its present form was built and remodelled during the 1740–50s during the reign of empress Maria Theresa who received the estate as a wedding gift. Franz I commissioned the redecoration of the palace exterior in the neoclassical style as it appears today.

Franz Joseph, the longest-reigning Emperor of Austria, was born at Schönbrunn and spent a great deal of his life there. He died there, at the age of 86, on 21 November 1916. Following the downfall of the Habsburg monarchy in November 1918, the palace became the property of the newly founded Austrian Republic and was preserved as a museum.

After World War II and during the Allied Occupation of Austria (1945—55), Schönbrunn Palace was requisitioned to provide office space for both the British Delegation to the Allied Commission for Austria, and for the headquarters for the small British Military Garrison present in Vienna. With the reestablishment of the Austrian republic in 1955, the palace once again became a museum. It is still sometimes used for important events such as the meeting between U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1961.

Since 1992, the palace and gardens have been owned and administered by the &quot;Schloss Schönbrunn Kultur-und Betriebsges.m.b.H.&quot;, a limited-liability company wholly owned by the Republic of Austria. The company conducts preservation and restoration of all palace properties without state subsidies. UNESCO catalogued Schönbrunn Palace on the World Heritage List in 1996, together with its gardens, as a remarkable Baroque ensemble and example of synthesis of the arts (&quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;).
== Gardens ==
The sculpted garden space between the palace and the Neptune Fountain is called the &quot;Great Parterre&quot;. In 1695, Jean Trehet, a disciple of André Le Nôtre, planned the French garden.

The complex includes many noteworthy staple luxuries of European palaces of the time, including the Tiergarten, an orangerie erected around 1755, and a palm house (replacing, by 1882, around ten earlier and smaller glass houses in the western part of the park).

The area called &quot;Meidlinger Vertiefung&quot; (Engl.: depression of Meidling) to the west of the castle was turned into a play area and drill ground for the children of the Habsburgs in the 19th century. At this time it was common to use parks for the military education of young princes. Whereas the miniature bastion, which was built for this purpose, does not exist anymore, the garden pavilion that was used as shelter still does. It was turned into a café in 1927 and is known as &quot;Landtmann&#x27;s Jausen Station&quot; since 2013.

At the outmost western edge, a botanical garden going back to an earlier arboretum was re-arranged in 1828, when the &quot;Old Palm House&quot; was built.

=== Sculptures ===
=== Gloriette ===

The garden axis points towards a hill, which since 1775 has been crowned by the Gloriette structure.

Maria Theresa decided the &quot;Gloriette&quot; should be designed to glorify Habsburg power and the &quot;Just War&quot; (a war that would be carried out of &quot;necessity&quot; and lead to peace), and thereby ordered the builders to recycle &quot;otherwise useless stone&quot; which was left from the near demolition of Schloss Neugebäude.

=== Roman Ruins ===

Originally known as the Ruin of Carthage, the Roman Ruin is a set of follies that was designed by the architect Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf von Hohenberg, and erected as an entirely new architectural feature in 1778. 

The fashion for picturesque ruins that became widespread with the rise of the Romantic movement soon after the middle of the 18th century symbolized both the decline of once great powers and the preservation of the remains of a heroic past. The Roman Ruin consists of a rectangular pool enclosed by a massive arch with lateral walls, evoking the impression of an ancient edifice slowly crumbling into the ground.

== Activities at Schönbrunn today ==
Schönbrunn is Vienna&#x27;s most popular tourist destination, which has been attended by 3,800,000 visitors in 2017. The whole Schönbrunn complex with Tiergarten Schönbrunn, Palmenhaus, Wüstenhaus, the Wagenburg, and the Schoenbrunn Palace Concerts accounted for more than five million visitors in 2009.
At the official website tickets can be purchased in advance for tours. In addition to tours and tour packages, many classical concerts featuring the music of Mozart and his contemporaries can be enjoyed with the added benefit of more time in the spectacular halls, Orangerie, or Schlosstheater.

The annual Summer Night Concert Schönbrunn is held on the grounds of Schönbrunn.

=== Schönbrunn Palace Concerts ===

The Schönbrunn Palace Concerts are served by the Schönbrunn Palace Orchestra. Founded in 1997, it is led by the chief opera conductor Maestro Guido Mancusi since 1998. He also founded Chamber Opera Schönbrunn in the Schönbrunn Palace Concert series. 

In Vienna, they offer daily concerts at the original location of the world-famous contest between Mozart &amp; Salieri (1786). They have a wealth of experience working with singers and ballet dancers. The Orchestra regularly tours around the world.

=== Film and television productions ===

The gardens and palace have been the location for many films and television productions including such productions as the &quot;Sissi&quot; trilogy in the 1950s, &quot;A Breath of Scandal&quot; with Sophia Loren, and also briefly in the Bond movie &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; when Bond (Timothy Dalton) and Kara are riding through the palace garden; the palace is also seen during the end credits. The comedy &quot;The Great Race&quot; was filmed there in 1965. Jackie Chan shot scenes for &quot;Armour of God&quot; on the grounds. More recently, the television drama &quot;The Crown Prince&quot; starring Max von Thun as Crown Prince Rudolf and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Kaiser Franz-Josef was filmed there.

The Austrian television series, &quot;Kommissar Rex&quot; has shot several episodes there. In the Kuroshitsuji episode 2: His Butler, Omnipotent, Sebastian Michaelis tells his master that he was a guest at the Schönbrunn Palace soirees before his contract was sealed with Ciel as he teaches the young master how to dance. Dutch violinist André Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra, along with the Opera Babes used it as the backdrop for a version of the European Anthem, &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; in 2003.

In the third leg of &quot;The Amazing Race 4&quot;, the palace hosted a Fast Forward task where one team had to carry trays of champagne glasses across a ballroom floor of waltzing couples. In the sixth leg of &quot;The Amazing Race 23&quot;, teams had to race through the garden&#x27;s maze and search for the Pit Stop located at the Gloriette.

The Disney animated TV show series &quot;Little Einsteins&quot; featured the Schönbrunn Palace during the Season 2 episode &quot;The Glass Slipper Ball&quot;, featuring the orange fish based on two clownfish, Marlin and Nemo from the 2003 Disney/Pixar animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and the painting by Andy Warhol and the music &quot;The Blue Danube Waltz&quot; by Johann Strauss II, based on the 1950 Disney animated fairy tale film, the title character and the book &quot;Cinderella&quot; by Charles Perrault which first aired in January 2007.

== The Schönbrunn Palace silver coin ==
The palace was selected as the main motif of a high value commemorative coin: the Austrian 10-euro The Palace of Schönbrunn silver coin, minted on 8 October 2003. The obverse shows the central part of the frontage of the palace behind one of the great fountains in the open space.

<doc id="165206" wikidata="Q380770" url="?curid=165206" title="Fujita scale">
<text>The Fujita scale (F-Scale; ), or Fujita–Pearson scale (FPP scale), is a scale for rating tornado intensity, based primarily on the damage tornadoes inflict on human-built structures and vegetation. The official Fujita scale category is determined by meteorologists and engineers after a ground or aerial damage survey, or both; and depending on the circumstances, ground-swirl patterns (cycloidal marks), weather radar data, witness testimonies, media reports and damage imagery, as well as photogrammetry or videogrammetry if motion picture recording is available. The Fujita scale was replaced with the Enhanced Fujita scale (EF-Scale) in the United States in February 2007. In April 2013, Canada adopted the EF-Scale over the Fujita scale along with 31 &quot;Specific Damage Indicators&quot; used by Environment Canada (EC) in their ratings.

== Background ==
The scale was introduced in 1971 by Ted Fujita of the University of Chicago, in collaboration with Allen Pearson, head of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center/NSSFC (currently the Storm Prediction Center/SPC). The scale was updated in 1973, taking into account path length and width. In the United States, starting in the late 1970s, tornadoes were rated soon after occurrence. The Fujita scale was applied retroactively to tornadoes reported between 1950 and the adoption of the scale in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Tornado Database. Fujita rated tornadoes from 1916 to 1992 and Tom Grazulis of The Tornado Project retroactively rated all known significant tornadoes (F2–F5 or causing a fatality) in the U.S. back to 1880.
The Fujita scale was adopted in most areas outside of the United Kingdom.

On February 1, 2007, the Fujita scale was decommissioned, and the Enhanced Fujita Scale was introduced in the United States. The new scale more accurately matches wind speeds to the severity of damage caused by the tornado.

Though each damage level is associated with a wind speed, the Fujita scale is effectively a damage scale, and the wind speeds associated with the damage listed are not rigorously verified. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was formulated due to research that suggested that the wind speeds required to inflict damage by intense tornadoes on the Fujita scale are greatly overestimated. A process of expert elicitation with top engineers and meteorologists resulted in the EF scale wind speeds, but these are biased to United States construction practices. The EF scale also improved damage parameter descriptions.

== Derivation ==
The original scale as derived by Fujita was a theoretical 13-level scale (F0–F12) designed to smoothly connect the Beaufort scale and the Mach number scale. F1 corresponds to the twelfth level of the Beaufort scale, and F12 corresponds to Mach number 1.0. F0 was placed at a position specifying no damage (approximately the eighth level of the Beaufort scale), in analogy to how Beaufort&#x27;s zeroth level specifies little to no wind. From these wind speed numbers, qualitative descriptions of damage were made for each category of the Fujita scale, and then these descriptions were used to classify tornadoes.

At the time Fujita derived the scale, little information was available on damage caused by wind, so the original scale presented little more than educated guesses at wind speed ranges for specific tiers of damage. Fujita intended that only F0–F5 be used in practice, as this covered all possible levels of damage to frame homes as well as the expected estimated bounds of wind speeds. He did, however, add a description for F6, which he called an &quot;inconceivable tornado&quot;, to allow for wind speeds exceeding F5 and possible advancements in damage analysis that might show it. In total, two tornadoes received the rating of F6, but both were later downgraded to F5.

Based on aerial photographs of the damage it caused, Fujita assigned the strongest tornado of the 1974 Super Outbreak, which affected Xenia, Ohio, a preliminary rating of F6 intensity ± 1 scale. The 1977 Birmingham–Smithfield F5 tornado&#x27;s damage was surveyed by Ted Fujita and he &quot;toyed with the idea of rating the Smithfield tornado an F6&quot;. In 2001, tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis stated in his book &quot;F5–F6 Tornadoes&quot;; &quot;In my opinion, if there ever was an F6 tornado caught on video, it was the Pampa, Texas tornado of 1995&quot;. In 2023, it was announced by the Storm Prediction Center and National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma that the 1970 Lubbock tornado was originally rated F6, which was later downgraded to its official rating of F5.

Furthermore, the original wind speed numbers have since been found to be higher than the actual speeds required to incur the damage described at each category. The error manifests itself to an increasing degree as the category increases, especially in the range of F3 through F5. NOAA notes that &quot;precise wind speed numbers are actually guesses and have never been scientifically verified. Different wind speeds may cause similar-looking damage from place to place—even from building to building. Without a thorough engineering analysis of tornado damage in any event, the actual wind speeds needed to cause that damage are unknown.&quot; Since then, the Enhanced Fujita Scale has been created using better wind estimates by engineers and meteorologists.
== Parameters ==
The six categories are listed here, in order of increasing intensity.
* The rating of any given tornado is of the most severe damage to any well-built frame home or comparable level of damage from engineering analysis of other damage.
* Since the Fujita scale is based on the severity of damage resulting from high winds, a tornado exceeding F5 is an immeasurable theoretical construct. Frame-home structural damage cannot exceed total destruction and debris dispersal, which constitutes F5 damage. A tornado with wind speeds greater than is possible, as the 1999 Bridge Creek-Moore Tornado did have 321 mph (517 km/h) winds, but that measurement was not near ground level.

===Pearson scales===
In 1973, Allen Pearson added additional path length and path width parameters to the Fujita scale. Under this version, each tornado would be assigned one Fujita scale rating and two Pearson scale ratings. For example, a tornado rated F4 based on damage with a path length of and a path width of would be rated F,P,P 4,4,4. Use of the Pearson scales was not widespread, however, and it remained more common to simply list a tornado&#x27;s path length and path width directly.
== Rating classifications ==

For purposes such as tornado climatology studies, Fujita scale ratings may be grouped into classes.

The Fujita scale, introduced in 1971 as a means to differentiate tornado intensity and path area, assigned wind speeds to damage that were, at best, educated guesses. Fujita and others recognized this immediately and intensive engineering analysis was conducted through the rest of the 1970s. This research, as well as subsequent research, showed that tornado wind speeds required to inflict the described damage were actually much lower than the F-scale indicated, particularly for the upper categories. Also, although the scale gave general descriptions of damage a tornado could cause, it gave little leeway for strength of construction and other factors that might cause a building to sustain more damage at lower wind speeds. Fujita tried to address these problems somewhat in 1992 with the Modified Fujita Scale, but by then he was semi-retired and the National Weather Service was not in a position to update to an entirely new scale, so it went largely unenacted.

In the United States, on February 1, 2007, the Fujita scale was decommissioned in favor of what scientists believe is a more accurate Enhanced Fujita Scale. The meteorologists and engineers who designed the EF Scale believe it improves on the F-scale on many counts. It accounts for different degrees of damage that occur with different types of structures, both manmade and natural. The expanded and refined damage indicators and degrees of damage standardize what was somewhat ambiguous. It also is thought to provide much better estimates of wind speeds and sets no upper limit on the wind speeds for the highest level, EF5. Environment Canada began using the Enhanced Fujita scale in Canada on April 1, 2013. The U.S. and Canada are the only countries to officially adopt the Enhanced Fujita scale.

<doc id="165209" wikidata="Q877132" url="?curid=165209" title="Kwai Tsing District">
<text>Kwai Tsing is one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong. It consists of two parts - Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi Island. Kwai Tsing is part of the New Territories. It had a population of 520,572 in 2016. The district has the third least educated residents and their income is below average.

Kwai Tsing did not exist as a standalone district when Hong Kong&#x27;s District Boards were formed in the early 1980s. It remained as a part of Tsuen Wan district until 1985. The newly created district was known as Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi District () until 1988, when its name was shortened to Kwai Tsing District.

The internationally famous container terminals can be found within the district, along the shores of Rambler Channel between Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi Island. The Tsing Ma Bridge, leading to the Hong Kong International Airport through the North Lantau Highway, starts at the northwestern end of Tsing Yi Island.

Over 75% of the district residents live in public housing.
==History==
In 1669, the Qing dynasty forced the people in Hong Kong and the coastal regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, etc., to move to the inland areas of mainland China. After this move inland policy ceased, a large number of Hakka people from the Huayang region of Guangdong province, as well as the Hakka districts of Fujian province, moved to what is now Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Traditionally, Kwai Tsing District has been a Hakka speaking region; the original inhabitants of the villages in this area were mainly of Hakka extraction.

==Geography==
Kwai Tsing District borders in the north and west with Tsuen Wan District, east with Sha Tin District, southeast with Sham Shui Po District and Yau Tsim Mong District (marine), south with Central and Western District (marine), and southwest with Islands District (marine liners and similar).

==Town centre==
The district is part of Tsuen Wan New Town. Unlike other new towns in Hong Kong, the district has no clear town core in the course of development. Cores emerge only after Metroplaza in Kwai Fong and Maritime Square in Tsing Yi was built, but they are still incomparable to their counterparts in other new towns in Hong Kong.

==Industry==
Industry is an integral part of the district. Both light and heavy industries share substantial land in the district.

==Education==

Like other early new towns of Hong Kong, the district was primary for settling the influx of Chinese population around the year of the change of sovereignty in China in 1949 and the baby boom afterwards. Public housing estates were built throughout the district. Many schools have been established by various charities and religious organisations. Some have provided vocational training for industries in Hong Kong while some have become liberal schools. As the community has aged, the number of school children declined after the 2000s, and schools are facing survival problems.

Secondary schools in 2006:

*Buddhist Sin Tak College
*Buddhist Yip Kei Nam Memorial College
*Caritas St. Joseph Secondary School
*Carmel Alison Lam Foundation Secondary School

==Leisure==
There are several sports grounds in the district. Biu Chun Rangers are based in Tsing Yi. Kwai Tsing Theatre in Kwai Fong is gradually becoming an important performance venue in Hong Kong.

==Transport==
The usual forms of transportation in the district are buses, minibuses and metro.

The MTR (metro) Tsuen Wan line has four stations on three lines running through the district:
* Lai King is the southernmost, and the interchange between Tsuen Wan and Tung Chung line.
* The Tsuen Wan line then runs through two stations (Kwai Fong, Kwai Hing) before exiting the district for Tsuen Wan.
* Tung Chung line diverges to the west to Tsing Yi Island and have a station, Tsing Yi, there.
* Tsing Yi station is also served by Airport Express, which is the last station before reaching the Airport.

<doc id="165213" wikidata="Q281527" url="?curid=165213" title="Wan Chai">
<text>Wan Chai is located in the western part of Wan Chai District on the northern shore of Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. It is bounded by Canal Road to the east, Arsenal Street to the west, and Bowen Road to the south. The area north of Gloucester Road is often called Wan Chai North.

Wan Chai is one of the busiest commercial areas in Hong Kong with offices of many small and medium-sized companies. Wan Chai North features office towers, parks, hotels and an international conference and exhibition centre. Wan Chai is also well known for its famous night life which has evolved over decades. As one of the first areas developed in Hong Kong, There are various landmarks and skyscrapers within the area, most notably the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC), Central Plaza and Hopewell Centre.

==Names==

Wan Chai originally began as Ha Wan (), literally meaning &quot;a bottom ring&quot; or &quot;lower circuit&quot;. As one of the earliest developed areas in Hong Kong along the Victoria Harbour, Central (&quot;centre ring&quot; in Chinese), Sheung Wan (&quot;upper ring&quot;), Sai Wan (&quot;western ring&quot;) and Wan Chai are collectively known as the &quot;four rings&quot; () by the locals. Wan Chai literally means &quot;a cove&quot; in Cantonese, from the shape of its coastal line; however, owing to drastic city development and continual land reclamation, the area is no longer a cove.

==History==

Wan Chai was the first home to many Chinese villagers living along the undisturbed coastlines in proximity to Hung Shing Temple. Most of them were fishermen, who worked around the area near Hung Shing Temple overlooking the entire harbour. Hung Shing Ye, the God of the Sea, was one of the deities worshipped by the locals.

===British Colony (from 1842)===
With the growth of the British Hong Kong administration, centred in old Victoria (modern Central), Wan Chai attracted those on the fringes of society, such as &quot;coolie&quot; workers, who came to live on Queen&#x27;s Road East. A focal point of development at that time was Spring Gardens, a red-light zone.

By the 1850s, the area was already becoming a Chinese residential area. There were dockyards on Ship Street and McGregor Street for building and repairing ships. The edge of Sun Street, Moon Street and Star Street was the original site of the first power station in Hong Kong, operated by the Hongkong Electric Company, which began supplying power in 1890.

One of the first waterfront hospitals was the Seaman&#x27;s Hospital, built in 1843, which was funded by the British merchant group Jardine&#x27;s. It was then sold to the British Royal Navy in 1873 and subsequently redeveloped into the Royal Naval Hospital. After the Second World War, the hospital was revitalised as the Ruttonjee Hospital and became one of the main public hospitals in Hong Kong.

The district was home to several well-known schools. One of these schools was established by the famous traditional teacher, Mo Dunmei (). Started as a &quot;shushu&quot; () in 1919, the school was renamed Dunmei School () in 1934 after him. It taught classical Chinese writings and Confucian ethics.

In 1936, the Chinese Methodist Church () moved its building from Caine Road, Mid-levels Central, to Hennessy Road (), Wanchai, a thoroughfare of the district running from west to east. This church building became the landmark of the district. In 1998, this building was demolished and replaced by a 23-storey building.

===Second World War and the Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)===
During the Japanese occupation in the early 1940s, many bombardments took place in Wan Chai. There were abundant incidents of cannibalism, starvation, torture and abuses of the local population by the Japanese soldiers, including the illegal use of child labour. Senior residents could recall vividly how they survived the hardships: this oral history became an important, first-hand source of the harsh living conditions in Hong Kong under the Japanese period. The Dunmei school was closed during the Japanese occupation period. After the war, the school continued to provide Chinese education for children from families of higher income.

===Post-war development (from 1945)===
During the 1950s, the pro-Communist underground cell network Hailiushe (海流社) established their headquarters at the rooftop of a multi-story house on Spring Garden Lane. This group was successfully raided by the Hong Kong Police.

Prostitution had been one of the oldest occupations in Wan Chai. There are numerous historical accounts of women trading sexual services for western merchandise, especially with sailors from trading ships visiting this area. In the 1960s, Wan Chai became legendary for its exotic night life, especially for the US servicemen resting there during the War in Vietnam. Despite rapid changes of Wan Chai&#x27;s demography due to reclamation and redevelopment, the presence of sex workers operating among ordinary residential areas has continued to be a distinctive feature. Some of the lifestyle was illustrated in past movies such as &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;.

===Transfer of sovereignty to China (PRC)===
Wan Chai&#x27;s HKCEC has been home to major political and economic events. It was the site of the Hong Kong handover ceremony in 1997, in which the last governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, formally concluded the British chapter and transferred Hong Kong to China. The WTO Ministerial Conference in 2005 was also one of the largest international events hosted in Hong Kong, with delegates from 148 countries participating.

In May 2009, 300 guests and staff members at the Metropark Hotel in Wan Chai were quarantined, suspected of being infected or in contact with the H1N1 virus during the global outbreak of swine flu. A 25-year-old Mexican man who had stayed at the hotel was later found to have caught the viral infection. He had traveled to Hong Kong from Mexico via Shanghai.

===Reclamation===

Wan Chai&#x27;s coastline has been extended outwards after a series of land reclamation schemes. Early in 1841, the coastline was located at Queen&#x27;s Road East (the area of Spring Gardens and Ship Street). The first reclamation took place and new land was sold to The project was privately funded and the government did not take part. Soon after, in 1858, the Minister and his salesmen sold the land back to after Sir Robert Brown Black 

The next reclamation project in Wan Chai was the Praya East Reclamation Scheme. The coastline was extended to today&#x27;s Gloucester Road. The reclamation after World War II from 1965 to 1972 pushed the coastline further out to the areas around Convention Avenue and The 1990s Wan Chai Development project added additional land, on which the current HKCEC stands today.

==Community life==

===Arts and culture===
Wan Chai is a major hub of foreign and Chinese cultural institutions in Hong Kong. It is home to the French Alliance Francaise, German and the British Council (until 2001). Near the waterfront, there are the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts and Hong Kong Arts Centre, two of the most popular venues for theatrical and cultural performances in Hong Kong. The Academy for Performing Arts is a higher education institution that trains musicians, performers, actors and dancers, as well as a public venue for drama, concerts, dance, and musicals productions. Every year the academy produces a number of Broadway musicals, including &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, and &quot;Annie&quot;. The Arts Centre, just opposite to the academy, houses a studio theatre, art galleries, rehearsal rooms, the Goethe-Institut and a restaurant overlooking the Victoria Harbour.

The Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC), a HK$4.8 billion convention centre with an extension completed in 1997, covers over 16 acres (65,000 m2) of newly reclaimed land that added an extra 38,000 m2 of functional space to the existing convention centre. It remains a venue for international trade fairs, some of which are among the biggest in the world: the annual Hong Kong Book Fair in July, food fair and festival, technology exhibitions, and cosplay competitions.

===Dining===
* Cha chaan teng are local-styled fast-food restaurants, and Chinese pastry. Many of the restaurants can be found all along Jaffe Road. Numerous tea shops offer cheap Chinese herbal tea, like leong cha (&quot;lit.&quot; cool tea) and 24-mei.
* Dai pai dong, open-air restaurants in a big tent, is another classic restaurant type that appeared in Wan Chai. Despite the often unclean and uncomfortable eating conditions, many people are attracted to the freshly made steamed rice roll, congee and chow mein early in the morning. Due to urban renewal projects in recent years, most of these restaurants are fading away.
* Yum Cha, is the name associated with having dim sum, e.g. Fook Lam Moon restaurant. People usually have &quot;one bowl with two pieces&quot; (, meaning a cup of tea with two dim sums) for breakfast. There were three old-styled dims restaurants remaining in Wan Chai, namely &quot;Lung Mun&quot;, &quot;Lung To&quot;, and &quot;Lung Tuen&quot;. &quot;Lung Mun&quot;, the last of the trio, closed on 30 November 2009. A number of Buddhist cuisine restaurants are also available in the area.
* The 1980s also saw an expansion of Western-cuisine restaurants in Wan Chai. Nowadays, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai and Indian restaurants are all very common. There are also many fast food restaurants serving Cantonese and other Chinese dishes, including the franchised Maxim&#x27;s and Café de Coral. Jaffe Road and Lockhart Road are famous for pubs.

===Bar district===
The area towards the western end of Lockhart Road, including a small part of the parallel Jaffe Road, is one of Hong Kong island&#x27;s two main bar districts (the other being the more upmarket Lan Kwai Fong in Central). Once considered primarily as a red light district, this area is now more diverse with bars, pubs, restaurants and discos. A number of the raunchier bars still remain; however, their doorways festooned with women from Thailand and the Philippines. The famous novel and film &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; sets many scenes in this area. The bar district has been popular with visiting sailors and navies, when Fenwick Pier, west of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, was in use as a military pier.

===Recreational activities===

Southorn Playground on Johnston Road (the tram line) is a meeting place for the locals in Wan Chai, particularly the senior residents. During the prime years of the British colonial administration, coolie workers would convene at the playground in the morning to await employment opportunities. In the evening, the playground became an open-air pitch where people sold food, performed magic and kung fu.

Some of those trademark activities still exist through today: senior citizens socialise and play Chinese chess, young people at school play football and basketball, ad-hoc street basketball games that attract flocks of spectators and players. Occasionally, the entire playground is used for carnival fairs, three-player drill basketball contests and hip hop dance competitions.

===Religious diversity===

Wan Chai&#x27;s places of worship represent Buddhism, Taoism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Christianity, Mormonism, Sikhism, and Islam. Despite the wide variety, many religious structures are located in close proximity to each other. Hung Shing Temple, for example, is a typically Taoist temple. Inside, there are Buddhist Kwun Yum chapels next to the main altar. People coming to worship Hung Shing Ye could also burn joss sticks to Kwun Yum as well. Villain hitting is another blended ceremony, combining in different proportions Confucianism, Taoism, and folk religion. Some old female &quot;psychics&quot; perform this ancient ceremony under the Canal Road Flyover in particular days of a lunar month. The Wan Chai Khalsa Diwan Sikh Temple is the biggest Sikh temple in Hong Kong. The Asia Area Office of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, along with chapels where multiple congregations meet throughout the week, is on Gloucester Road.

==Tourism and landmarks==
Wan Chai offers historical conservation sites including Old Wan Chai Post Office, Hung Shing Temple and Pak Tai Temple. Many of the medium-sized shopping centres are named in numerals, such as Oriental 188, 328, and 298 Computer Centre. These numbers might have come from the earlier days when all prostitution houses were numbered, as they were referred to as &quot;big numbers&quot; (, &quot;dai lum bah&quot;).

There are many commercial complexes and office skyscrapers in Wan Chai. The HK$4.4 billion 78-storey skyscraper Central Plaza currently stands as the third tallest building in Hong Kong. Small but free art exhibitions used to be held on the second floor all year round, whereas the first floor connects Wan Chai&#x27;s footbridge network: the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Centre at the network&#x27;s extreme north, Wan Chai Pier, China Building, Harbour Centre, Central Plaza, Immigration Department Tower, Wan Chai Court, Wan Chai MTR station and Johnston Road (the tram line) at the network&#x27;s extreme south.

More recent tourist attractions include the Golden Bauhinia Square, the site of a daily flag-rising ceremony. This ceremony is enhanced on 1 July (Handover of Hong Kong) and 1 October (National Day of China).

A 3-storey pergola exhibition is built opposite to Li Chit Garden. Tai Fat Hau footbridge also holds an art display of the fingerprints of 30,000 citizens slated for the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. The sticker pictures on 50 poles of the bridge have been colloquially called the &quot;50 landscapes of Wan Chai&quot; ().

Lovers&#x27; Rock reclines on the hillside of Bowen Road near Shiu Fai Terrace, mid-levels Wan Chai. The rock received its name since it resembles a small, thin column sticking out of the rock base. This special-looking rock is said to have granted happy marriages to its devoted worshippers. Many people are attracted by its reputation.

==Buildings and constructions==


===Architecture===
Throughout Wan Chai&#x27;s history, construction styles have changed according to the architectural movement at the time.

In the 1950s and 1960s, an increasing number of girlie bars and nightclubs were opened in the red-light district by Jaffe and Lockhart Road. The establishments entertained visiting sailors landing at Fenwick Pier. Beyond Gloucester Road is the commercial area developed in the late 1970s and 1980s, a time at which Hong Kong underwent economic development at full speed. At the same time, buildings like the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, HKCEC, and Central Plaza were constructed on the newly reclaimed land.

Skyscrapers in Wan Chai include:
* Central Plaza, 78 floors, offices, completed in 1992
* Hopewell Centre, 64 floors, offices, completed in 1980
* Sun Hung Kai Centre, 56 floors, offices, completed in 1981
* May House, 47 floors, government offices, completed in 2004. Headquarters of the Hong Kong Police Force
* China Online Centre, 52 floors, offices, completed in 2000
* Three Pacific Place, 40 floors, offices, completed in 2004
* Convention Plaza Office Tower, 50 floors, offices, completed in 1990
* Immigration Tower, 49 floors, government offices, completed in 1990
* Revenue Tower, 49 floors, government offices, completed in 1990
* Wanchai Tower, 44 floors, government offices, completed in 1985
* MLC Tower, 40 floors, offices, completed in 1998
* Wu Chung House, 40 floors, offices and government offices, completed in 1992
* Great Eagle Centre, 35 floors, offices, completed in 1983
* Shui On Centre, 35 floors, offices, completed in 1987
* QRE Plaza, 35 floors, offices and shops, completed in 2007
* China Resources Building, 48 floors, offices, completed in 1983 
* Harbour Centre, 33 floors, offices, completed in 1983

===Urban decay and renewal===
Many of Wan Chai&#x27;s older buildings now face a serious problem of urban decay. To tackle the problem, the government has launched a series of urban renewal projects to bring new life into the area. Many local residents have relocation worries such as whether the Urban Renewal Authority can compensate enough to put them in a new space of equal size. Other concerns involve the loss of building character that make up part of that Hong Kong cultural identity.

* Demolition of Lee Tung St – Old buildings on Lee Tung Street are scheduled for demolition. Many businesses have shut down or moved out. Today, most stores have signs on their gate proclaiming &quot;This is an Urban Renewal Authority Property&quot;.
* Renovation of Tai Yuen St – Visitors may gain a distinctive experience of bustling local street-stall shopping in Tai Yuen Street. Many huckster stalls sell a wide variety of dried goods, garments, household products, dumplings, and Chinese herbal medicine. This predominantly tourist attraction area is a place where old houses and modern mansions mingle, creating an interesting disparity.

===Central and Wan Chai reclamation (from 2007)===

After the completion of the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation Feasibility Study in 1989, the Land Development Policy Committee endorsed the idea of an ongoing series of reclamation. The reclamation comprises three discrete development areas to be aligned by public parks, namely, Central, Tamar and Exhibition. The urban development of each cell would be further divided into five subsequent phases. As of 2014, reclamation for the Central area has been completed: the area is largely taken by the new government offices and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (its old building in the heart of Central has been reverted to its original use as the Supreme Court).

==Government==
The Hong Kong Immigration Department has its headquarters at the Immigration Tower in Wan Chai. The Hong Kong Police Force operates from the Wan Chai District; their headquarters is located at the Wan Chai Police District Headquarters, 1 Arsenal Street. within the Hong Kong Police Headquarters Compound. Maggie Farley of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said in 1996, referring to the then Wan Chai Police Station, that the police headquarters was &quot;a stolid, whitewashed building with square pillars and breezy verandas&quot;.

==Economy==
Esquel Group has its head office in (海港中心), Wan Chai.

Jademan (now Culturecom) was formerly headquartered in Harbour Centre.

==Transportation==

Geographically, Wan Chai is the crossing point between the Central and Western District (West Point/Central), and the Eastern (Causeway Bay/North Point) district. Its thoroughfares connect the main developed areas along the northern coast of Hong Kong Island. The transport infrastructure is efficient, convenient and highly accessible.

* Mass Transit Railway (MTR)
** Wan Chai station on the Island line, trains run between Kennedy Town and Chai Wan (north-eastern part of Hong Kong Island)
** Exhibition Centre station on the East Rail line, trains run between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau border crossings
* Trams run between Kennedy Town and Shau Kei Wan (north-eastern part of Hong Kong Island)
* Buses travel along thoroughfares such as Gloucester Road and Hennessy Road, with destinations as different parts of Hong Kong
* Ferry services from Wan Chai Pier to Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon, across the Victoria Harbour

===Ferries===
The Star Ferry at Wan Chai Pier is the sole ferry operator in the area. Frequent services cross the Victoria Harbour from HKCEC, Wan Chai to the Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui. In light of more convenient and competitive cross-harbour public transportation, the Star Ferry continues to provide an inexpensive option to local commuters. Numerous shipping companies, such as the Anglo-Eastern Group, also have their headquarters in Wan Chai.

===Main roads and tunnels===

Wan Chai&#x27;s Gloucester Road, an east–west trunk route along the northern coast, is connected to Cross-Harbour Tunnel, the first undersea tunnel in Hong Kong. This tunnel is connected to the south by a direct viaduct from its landing point on Hong Kong Island to the Aberdeen Tunnel towards the southern coast. Connecting Hong Kong Island at Kellett Island (the site of the Royal Navy Club) to a reclaimed site at Hung Hom Bay in Kowloon, this tunnel provides a direct link by road. Prior to the tunnel&#x27;s opening in 1972, local drivers and pedestrians depended solely upon the Star Ferry services to cross the Victoria Harbour. Linking the main financial districts on both sides of Victoria Harbour, the tunnel carries 123,000 vehicles daily. On the other hand, the thoroughfare Queen&#x27;s Road East, an extension from Queen&#x27;s Road West at Kennedy Town, through Queen&#x27;s Road Central at Central, Queensway at Admiralty, takes a southerly route to provide an alternative east–west road link. Due to Wan Chai&#x27;s early involvement in the British colonial administration, road names were often taken from previous Governors, such as Hennessy Road, and notable people (Gloucester Road, Jaffe Road, Lockhart Road, Johnston Road, Fleming Road, Luard Road, O&#x27;Brien Road, Marsh Road, Stewart Road, McGregor Street, etc.).

===Mass Transit Railway===

*Island line – Wan Chai

The MTR Island line runs beneath Hennessy Road, a thoroughfare, in the locality. Due to the large size of Wan Chai, more than 50 entry/exit gates and 8 entrances/exits are set up. An extension project was carried out in the early 2000s; it created two additional entrances/exits, one of which connects to the footbridge network from the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Centre to the station. Then this footbridge is also interconnected with covered corridor of buildings along the Victoria Harbour, and ends up at Wan Chai Pier.

*East Rail line - Exhibition Centre

The East Rail line was extended from Hung Hom to Admiralty in 2022 as part of the Shatin to Central Link project, with a newly built station near the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Centre. Its exits connect to the footbridge network in Wan Chai North which also leads back to Wan Chai station.

===Trams===
Tram services run between Shau Kei Wan on the northeastern part of the island and Kennedy Town on the west, with a circular branch serving Happy Valley and the Happy Valley Racecourse. The tram route runs across Johnston Road and Hennessy Road.

===Buses===
Most buses travel in Wan Chai from Admiralty to Causeway Bay via Hennessy Road or, in the opposite direction, Johnston Road and Gloucester Road.

===Taxis===
Red taxi (urban) services are available to hire in Wan Chai. These can be pre-booked by telephone; however, hailing on the street is a more common way of getting a taxicab. Vehicles that carry a green plate at the front of their cars are able to carry passengers across the Victoria Harbour to Kowloon. There are, however, areas with restricted kerbs and designated pick-up and drop-off points in the area.

===Minibus===
There are two types of minibuses in Wan Chai, the green minibus and the red minibus. In general, green minibuses operate on scheduled service with fixed routes and published fares. Red minibuses run with government licence but on non-scheduled services, casually connecting regular travellers and commuters to specific urban areas across Hong Kong Island. Drivers of red minibuses will display fares in the front of their minibus windshields.

<text>Karl Renner (14 December 1870 – 31 December 1950) was an Austrian politician and jurist of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Austria. He is often referred to as the &quot;Father of the Republics&quot; because he led the first government of the Republic of German-Austria and the First Austrian Republic in 1919 and 1920, and was once again decisive in establishing the present Second Republic after the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, becoming its first President after World War II (and fourth overall).

==Early life==
Renner was born the 18th child of an ethnic German family of poor wine-growers in Unter-Tannowitz (present-day Dolní Dunajovice in the Czech Republic), then part of the Margraviate of Moravia, a crown land of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Because of his intelligence, he was allowed to attend a selective &quot;gymnasium&quot; in nearby Nikolsburg (Mikulov), where one of his teachers was Wilhelm Jerusalem. From 1890 to 1896 he studied law at the University of Vienna. In 1895 he was one of the founding members of the Friends of Nature () organisation and created their logo.

==Political career==
In 1896 he joined the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Austria (SDAP), representing the party in the National Council () from the 1907 elections until its dissolution in November 1918. During this period he founded and edited the party&#x27;s journal, &quot;Der Kampf&quot;, together with Otto Bauer and Adolf Braun. Renner&#x27;s interest in politics also led him to become a librarian for the &quot;Reichsrat&quot;. During these early years, he developed new perspectives on law — all the while cloaking his innovative ideas under a variety of pseudonyms (for example, Synopticus and Rudolf Springer) lest he lose his coveted post as parliamentary librarian. He was especially interested in the problems of the Austrian state, whose existence he justified on geographical, economic and political grounds. On the nationality question, he upheld the so-called &quot;personal autonomy&quot; on the basis of which the super-national state should develop, and thereby influenced the agenda and tactics of the Social Democratic Party in dealing with it. As a theorist he was reckoned as one of the leaders of Austro-Marxism.

===First Republic===
In 1918, after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he was in the forefront of the Provisional and the Constitutional National Assemblies of those Cisleithanian &quot;Lands Represented in the Reichsrat&quot; (the formal description of the Austrian half of the Dual Monarchy) that predominantly spoke German and had decided to form a nation-state like the other nationalities had done. Renner became the first head of government (&quot;State Chancellor&quot;) of that newly established small German-speaking republic which refused to be considered the heir of the Habsburg monarchy and wished to be known as the &quot;Republic of German-Austria&quot; (). This name, however, was prohibited by The Entente. They also vetoed a resolution of the Constituent National Assembly in Vienna that &quot;German-Austria&quot; was to be part of the German Weimar Republic. Even before the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, Renner had proposed a future union of the German parts of Austria with Germany, even using the word &quot;Anschluss&quot;. Like other Austrian socialists, Renner believed that the best course was to seek union with Germany.

He was the leader of the delegation that represented this new German-Austria in the negotiations of St. Germain where the &quot;Republic of Austria&quot; was acknowledged but was declared to be the responsible successor to Imperial Austria. There Renner had to accept that this new Austria was prohibited any political association with Germany and he had to accept the loss of German-speaking South Tyrol and the German-speaking parts of Bohemia and Moravia where he himself was born; this forced him to give up his share in the parental farm if he, &quot;the peasant proprietor who turned Marxist&quot;, wanted to remain an Austrian government officer.

Renner was Chancellor of Austria of the first three coalition cabinets from 1918 until 1920 and at the same time Minister of Foreign Affairs, backed by a grand coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Social Party. A wide range of social reforms were introduced by Renner&#x27;s government, including unemployment insurance, paid holidays, the eight-hour workday, and regulations on the working conditions of miners, bakers, women, and children. State aid was also provided for the disabled, together with health insurance for public employees. In addition, a law was passed that provided for collective bargaining and the mediation of disputes.

From 1931 to 1933, Renner was President of Parliament, the National Council of Austria. After the dictatorial Austrofascism period from 1934, when his party was prohibited, he even welcomed the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in 1938. Having originally been a proponent of new German-Austria becoming a part of the democratic German Republic, he expected Nazism to be but a passing phenomenon not worse than the dictatorship of Dollfuss&#x27;s and Schuschnigg&#x27;s authoritarian one-party system. During World War II, however, he distanced himself from politics completely.

===Relationship with Nazism and Communism===
On 2 April 1938, Renner appealed to Austrians to vote &quot;yes&quot; in the 10 April plebiscite that legitimized the Anschluss; many Austrians followed his advice, and as a result, Austrians welcomed the Germans and Hitler himself. After the Anschluss, Renner offered to serve in the Nazi government during the occupation, but his offer was declined. During the occupation, according to official Austrian figures, 51,500 Austrian Jews out of a total of 200,000 died in concentration camps, which, as documented during the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, had a disproportionately large number of Austrian guards.

On 29 March 1945, Soviet commander Fyodor Tolbukhin&#x27;s troops crossed the former Austrian border at Klostermarienberg in Burgenland. On 3 April, at the beginning of the Vienna offensive, Renner, then living in southern Lower Austria, established contact with the Soviets. Joseph Stalin had already established a would-be future Austrian cabinet from the country&#x27;s communists in exile, but Tolbukhin&#x27;s telegram changed Stalin&#x27;s mind in favor of Renner.

On 20 April 1945, the Soviets, without asking their Western allies, instructed Renner to form a provisional government. Seven days later Renner&#x27;s cabinet took office, declared the independence of Austria from Nazi Germany and called for the creation of a democratic state along the lines of the First Austrian Republic. Soviet acceptance of Renner was not an isolated episode; their officers re-established district administrations and appointed local mayors, frequently following the advice of the locals, even before the battle was over.
Renner and his ministers were guarded and watched by NKVD bodyguards. One-third of State Chancellor Renner&#x27;s cabinet, including the crucial seats of the Secretary of State of the Interior and the Secretary of State for Education, was staffed by Austrian Communists. The Western allies suspected the establishment of a puppet state and did not recognize Renner. The British were particularly hostile, and even American President Harry S. Truman, who believed that Renner was a trustworthy politician rather than a token front for the Kremlin, denied him recognition. However, Renner had secured multi-party control of the government by designating two Under-Secretaries of State in each of the ministries, appointed by the two parties not designating the Secretary of State.

Historian Harold Green commented: &quot;But for Renner&#x27;s having gained Soviet support for creating a Social Democratic Austrian Republic - and his establishing it at record speed after the Nazi collapse - Austria might have shared Germany&#x27;s post-war fate and spent several decades divided into a Communist East Austria and a Democratic West Austria, with Vienna as a divided city like Berlin.&quot;

===Post–World War II===

Renner&#x27;s government opted to restore the 1920 Constitution, as amended in 1929. However, following elections that November, the Federal Assembly temporarily suspended the provision calling for the president to be popularly elected, and elected Renner as president on 20 November. Karl Renner died in 1950 in Vienna and was buried in the Presidential Tomb at the Zentralfriedhof.

==Antisemitism==
Antisemitism in contemporary Austria was widespread after the First World War and even after the Second World War, even in the highest government offices. Karl Renner, whom Emperor Karl I rejected as prime minister, stood out before and after the war due to vehement anti-Semitism. This attitude persisted even after the Nazi terror against Jewish returnees and survivors of the concentration camps. Marko Feingold, survivor of the concentration camp and president of the Salzburg Jewish Community, said in 2013: &quot;Karl Renner, after all the first Federal President of the Second Republic, had long been known in the party as an anti-Semite. He didn&#x27;t want us concentration campers in Vienna after the war and he also frankly said that Austria would not give anything back to them.&quot;

==Political beliefs and scholarly contributions==

For most of his life, Renner alternated between the political commitment of a social democrat and the analytical distance of an academic scholar. Central to Renner&#x27;s academic work is the problem of the relationship between private law and private property. With his [The Institutions of Private Law and their Social Functions] (1904), he became one of the founders of the discipline of the sociology of law. In this book, Renner developed a Marxist theory of the institution of private law. Renner argued that the separation of public and private law is a creation of capitalism, whereby the state enforces the interests of capital owners.

His and Otto Bauer&#x27;s ideas about the legal protection of cultural minorities were taken up by the Jewish Bund, but fiercely denounced by Vladimir Lenin. Joseph Stalin devoted a whole chapter to criticising Cultural National Autonomy in &quot;Marxism and the National Question&quot;.

The 1977–1978 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.

<text>Julius Raab (29 November 1891 – 8 January 1964) was a conservative Austrian politician who served as Federal Chancellor of Austria from 1953 to 1961. Raab steered Allied-occupied Austria to independence, when he negotiated and signed the Austrian State Treaty in 1955. In internal politics Raab stood for a pragmatic &quot;social partnership&quot; and the &quot;Grand coalition&quot; of Austrian Conservatives and Social Democrats.

==Biography==
Raab was born into a middle-class Catholic family in Sankt Pölten, Lower Austria, the son of a master builder. He attended a Catholic high school and in 1911 enrolled at the Vienna University of Technology to study civil engineering. He was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army as a pioneer officer before graduation and fought on the Russian and Italian fronts of World War I. After the defeat of Central Powers Raab returned to the university and engaged in politics. On 14 January 1923, Raab married Harmine Haumer.

The death of his father and the beginning of his political career in the First Austrian Republic compelled Raab to drop out of the university in 1925. From 1927 to 1934 he was a member of the National Council parliament as a Lower Austrian deputy of the Christian Social Party. Backed by Chancellor Ignaz Seipel, he was also active in the &quot;Heimwehr&quot; paramilitary arm of right-wing political forces, and was appointed chief for Lower Austria in 1928. However, his attempts to bind the paramilitary forces to the Christian Social Party ultimately failed. In 1932 he joined the Catholic &quot;Ostmärkische Sturmscharen&quot; forces led by his party fellows Kurt Schuschnigg and Leopold Figl. In 1933 Raab joined the Fatherland&#x27;s Front, the newly established right-wing coalition led by Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss. During the austrofascist period of 1934–1938 Raab progressed through the ranks of the Corporate State, and was appointed Minister of Commerce by Chancellor Schuschnigg just four weeks before the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot; to Nazi Germany.

Raab was ousted after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; but, unlike many other Austrian political leaders, escaped death or imprisonment through the help of the Lower Austrian Nazi &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Hugo Jury, whom he knew personally. He was never involved in the Austrian resistance but kept in touch with the old Christian Democrat elite and supported his fellow Leopold Figl after his release from imprisonment.

In April 1945, Raab was made a member of Karl Renner&#x27;s provisional government, formed in the Soviet zone of occupation in Austria. Raab co-founded the conservative Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP), which denounced the dark legacy of the 1930s, and assumed leadership of ÖVP parliamentary group after the legislative elections held in November 1945. However, he represented the austrofascist forces of the past that were unacceptable to the Soviets, and for a while was &quot;relegated to the back seat&quot;. From 1947, he expanded his influence through presidency in the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber, the institution tasked with managing social partnership of the government, the political parties, the entrepreneurs and the employees&#x27; trade unions. He clearly favored a free market and minimal government regulation of the economy. On the other hand, Raab also held talks with former Austrian Nazi officials like Wilhelm Höttl and Taras Borodajkewycz on their support for ÖVP politics.

Raab succeeded Leopold Figl as ÖVP party chairman in 1951 and as Federal Chancellor in 1953. Despite clearly Western attitudes, Raab established excellent relations with post-Stalin Soviet Union. In February 1955 Vyacheslav Molotov proposed resuming the talks on Austrian independence. On 12 April 1955 Raab, Foreign Minister Leopold Figl and State Secretary Bruno Kreisky arrived in Moscow for the negotiations that paved the way to the Austrian State Treaty concluded in Vienna on 15 May. Austria declared neutrality, as did all individual &quot;Bundesländer&quot;. The success of 1955 marked the peak of ÖVP influence, accompanied by a strong economic revival (&quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;) and full employment. The party won 46% of the popular vote in the 1956 elections, Raab retained his seat as Federal Chancellor. Despite criticism within the party, Raab strongly favored a tight coalition with the Social Democratic Party under Adolf Schärf. In 1957 he and trade union chief Johann Bohm co-founded the Joint Commission on Wages and Prices, the social partnership institution that became a cornerstone of Austrian corporatism.

In 1957 Raab suffered a light stroke. By the end of the 1950s, his own career and his party&#x27;s influence declined. In 1961 he passed ÖVP leadership to Alfons Gorbach, who also succeeded him as Federal Chancellor on 11 April. On 28 April 1963 Raab competed in the presidential elections but lost to incumbent Adolf Schärf. His health rapidly deteriorated, and he died, aged 72, in Vienna on 8 January 1964.

<doc id="165219" wikidata="Q878697" url="?curid=165219" title="BitKeeper">
<text>BitKeeper is a discontinued software tool for distributed revision control of computer source code. Originally developed as proprietary software by BitMover Inc., a privately held company based in Los Gatos, California, it was released as open-source software under the Apache-2.0 license on 9 May 2016. BitKeeper is no longer being developed.

== History ==

BitKeeper was originally developed by BitMover Inc., a privately held company from Los Gatos, California owned by Larry McVoy, who had previously designed TeamWare.

=== BitKeeper and the Linux kernel ===
BitKeeper was first mentioned as a solution to some of the growing pains that Linux was having in September 1998. Early access betas were available in May 1999 and on May 4, 2000, the first public release of BitKeeper was made available.
BitMover used to provide access to the system for certain open-source or free-software projects, one of which was the source code of the Linux kernel. The license for the &quot;community&quot; version of BitKeeper had allowed for developers to use the tool at no cost for open source or free software projects, provided those developers did not participate in the development of a competing tool (such as Concurrent Versions System, GNU arch, Subversion or ClearCase) for the duration of their usage of BitKeeper plus one year. This restriction applied regardless of whether the competing tool was free or proprietary. This version of BitKeeper also required that certain meta-information about changes be stored on computer servers operated by BitMover, an addition that made it impossible for community version users to run projects of which BitMover was unaware.

The decision made in 2002 to use BitKeeper for Linux kernel development was a controversial one. Some, including GNU Project founder Richard Stallman, expressed concern about proprietary tools being used on a flagship free project. While project leader Linus Torvalds and other core developers adopted BitKeeper, several key developers (including Linux veteran Alan Cox) refused to do so, citing the BitMover license, and voicing concern that the project was ceding some control to a proprietary developer. To mitigate these concerns, BitMover added gateways which allowed limited interoperation between the Linux BitKeeper servers (maintained by BitMover) and developers using CVS and Subversion. Even after this addition, flamewars occasionally broke out on the Linux kernel mailing list, often involving key kernel developers and BitMover&#x27;s CEO Larry McVoy, who was also a Linux contributor.

In April 2005, BitMover announced that it would stop providing a version of BitKeeper free of charge to the community, giving as the reason the efforts of Andrew Tridgell, a developer employed by OSDL on an unrelated project, to develop a client which would show the metadata (data about revisions, possibly including differences between versions) instead of only the most recent version. Being able to see metadata and compare past versions is one of the core features of all version-control systems, but was not available to anyone without a commercial BitKeeper license, significantly inconveniencing most Linux kernel developers. Although BitMover decided to provide free commercial BitKeeper licenses to some kernel developers, it refused to give or sell licenses to anyone employed by OSDL, including Linus Torvalds and Andrew Morton, placing OSDL developers in the same position as other kernel developers. The Git project was launched with the intent of becoming the Linux kernel&#x27;s source code management software, and was eventually adopted by Linux developers.

End of support for the &quot;Free Use&quot; version of BitKeeper was officially July 1, 2005, and users were required to switch to the commercial version or change version control system by then. Commercial users were also required not to produce any competing tools: In October 2005, McVoy contacted a customer using commercially licensed BitKeeper, demanding that an employee of the customer stop contributing to the Mercurial project, a GPL source management tool. Bryan O&#x27;Sullivan, the employee, responded, &quot;To avoid any possible perception of conflict, I have volunteered to Larry that as long as I continue to use the commercial version of BitKeeper, I will not contribute to the development of Mercurial.&quot;

=== Move to open-source ===
During the release of version 7.2ce at May 9, 2016, BitKeeper announced that it is starting to move from proprietary to open-source license, eventually releasing the software under the Apache License version 2.

<doc id="165220" wikidata="Q494920" url="?curid=165220" title="United States Pacific Fleet">
<text>The United States Pacific Fleet (USPACFLT) is a theater-level component command of the United States Navy, located in the Pacific Ocean. It provides naval forces to the Indo-Pacific Command. Fleet headquarters is at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, Hawaii, with large secondary facilities at Naval Air Station North Island, California.

==Origins==
A Pacific Fleet was created in 1907 when the Asiatic Squadron and the Pacific Squadron were combined. In 1910, the ships of the First Squadron were organized back into a separate Asiatic Fleet. The General Order 94 of 6 December 1922 organized the United States Fleet, with the Battle Force as the Pacific presence. Until May 1940, the Battle Force was stationed on the West Coast of the United States. Headquarters, battleships, aircraft carriers and heavy cruisers were stationed at San Pedro close to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. Light cruisers, destroyers and submarines were stationed at San Diego.

During the summer of 1940, as part of the U.S. response to Japanese expansionism, the fleet was instructed to take an &quot;advanced&quot; position at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Admiral James O. Richardson, the fleet&#x27;s commander, strongly opposed long-term basing at Pearl Harbor, feeling that it would leave the fleet vulnerable to Japanese attack, and personally protested the move in Washington, D.C. Political considerations were thought sufficiently important that he was relieved by Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who was in command at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Pacific Fleet was formally recreated on 1 February 1941, when General Order 143 split the United States Fleet into separate Atlantic, Pacific, and Asiatic Fleets.

==Composition in December 1941==
On 7 December, the Fleet consisted of the Battle Force, Scouting Force, Base Force, Amphibious Force (ComPhibPac), Cruiser Force (COMCRUPAC), Destroyer Force (COMDESPAC), and the Submarine Force (COMSUBPAC). Also in Hawaii was the Fourteenth Naval District, commanded by Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch.

When the attack took place, all three carriers were absent – &quot;Saratoga&quot; was in San Diego collecting her air group following a major refit, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was en route back to Hawaii following a mission to deliver aircraft to Wake Island, while &quot;Lexington&quot; had just departed on a similar mission to Midway.

The Amphibious Force was formally known as Commander, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet (ComPhibPac). On 7 December 1941 the Amphibious Force comprised the Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, under Army operational control, the 2nd Marine Division, the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, the 2nd Defense Battalion (see Marine defense battalions), and a depot. One of PhibPac&#x27;s subordinate commands during World War II was Transports, Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, or TransPhibPac. The commander of TransPhibPac was known as ComTransPhibPac. In addition to the ships assigned directly to the Pacific Fleet, Destroyer Division 80, consisting of the destroyers , , and , was assigned directly to the Fourteenth Naval District for the defence of the base and the fleet.

In December 1941, the fleet consisted of nine battleships, three aircraft carriers, 12 heavy cruisers, eight light cruisers, 50 destroyers, 33 submarines, and 100 patrol bombers. This was approximately the fleet&#x27;s strength at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That day, the Japanese Combined Fleet carried out the attack on Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States into World War II in the Pacific. The Pacific Fleet&#x27;s Battle Line took the brunt of the attack, with two battleships destroyed, two salvageable but requiring lengthy reconstruction, and four more lightly to moderately damaged, forcing the U.S. Navy to rely primarily on aircraft carriers and submarines for many months afterward.

Subsequently, Pacific Fleet engagements during World War II included the Battle of Guam, the Marshalls-Gilberts raids, the Doolittle Raid, the Solomon Islands campaign, the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and the Battle of Okinawa. More minor battles included the Battle of Dutch Harbor. The Submarine Force began a sustained campaign of commerce raiding against Japan&#x27;s merchant marine, beginning the first day of the war, which ultimately claimed 1,314 ships totalling about 5.3 million tons (by the imperfect postwar reckoning of the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee, JANAC). The West Loch disaster occurred at Pearl Harbor on 21 May 1944.

==Post-1945==
The Pacific Fleet took part in Operation Magic Carpet, the return of U.S. servicemen, after the end of the Second World War.
The organization of the Pacific Fleet in January 1947 is shown in Hal M. Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Arguing over the American Lake: Bureaucracy and Rivalry in the U.S. Pacific, 1945–1947.&quot;

Since 1950, the Pacific Fleet has been involved in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the two Taiwan Straits Crises, and a number of other operations including the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; Incident of 1975, as well as post-Vietnam related operations such as Operation New Arrivals. The RIMPAC exercise series began in 1971.

On 7 March 1984, the Secretaries of Transportation and Navy signed a Memorandum of Agreement which created the Maritime Defense Zones (MDZ). The Pacific MDZ is an echelon three Navy command under the Commander U.S. Pacific Fleet. The Pacific MDZ has responsibility for coastal defense up to around the U.S. West Coast, Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii during times of hostility. On 1 October 1990, Commander U.S. Naval Forces Alaska (COMUSNAVAK) was established as the Naval Component Commander to Commander, Alaskan Command (COMALCOM). Since its inception, COMUSNAVAK has grown to become responsible for coordinating all Navy activity in the Alaska and Aleutian area, for detailed planning and coordination for the Naval portion of the Joint and Combined Exercise Northern Edge, and coordinates high-visibility U.S. Navy ship visits throughout Alaska in support of public relations and recruiting initiatives.

The very large PACEX 89 in the North Pacific involved the USN, Canadian Navy, Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force, and ROK Navy. At the end of Exercise PACEX &#x27;89 a 54-ship formation was assembled for photos. It included the flagship, , the Battle Group, the Battle Group, two battleship surface action groups formed around and , and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force task force. &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; performed a simultaneous gunfire demonstration for the aircraft carriers and during PACEX. The highlight of PacEx for &quot;Missouri&quot; was a port visit in Pusan, Republic of Korea.

Other operations undertaken since include participation in the Alaskan Oil Spill Joint Task Force, including participation of Commander, Amphibious Group Three, as deputy CJTF. This was the defence response to the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill of March 1989. Also, the Pacific Fleet was involved in Joint Task Force Philippines during the December 1989 coup attempt there, which involved two carrier battle groups, USS &quot;Midway&quot; and USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-with their associated air wings operating in the Philippine Sea, chopped to JTF Philippines. During the operations, the carriers maintained deck alerts and 24-hour coverage of Manila with E-2C aircraft.

Around 10 September 1990, and visited Vladivostok. This marked the first United States Navy visit to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Pacific port of Vladivostok since before World War II. Before the visit was completed, the crew received word that their Pacific cruise was canceled. They returned to Long Beach and joined the Battle Group preparing to deploy to the Persian Gulf.

During Operation Fiery Vigil in June 1991, the following vessels and groups participated in the sealift phase of the evacuation: the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; battle group (COMCARGRU 3 embarked): , , , , , , , Amphibious Ready Group Alpha (COMPHIBRON 3 embarked): , , , , and a large number of other vessels: , , , , , , , , , , , , USNS &quot;Passumpsic&quot;, , , , . (CNA, 1994, 113) Further operations included JTF Marianas (August–September 1992) and JTF Hawaii (September–October 1992).

Other contingency operation after 1991 included Operation Sea Angel (Bangladesh relief) (led by Commander III Marine Expeditionary Force), Operation Eastern Exit, and involvement in the Somali Civil War – &#x27;Restore Hope&#x27;. During &#x27;Restore Hope,&#x27; Navy command arrangements underwent a number of changes during the operation. At the start, the principal naval forces were the &quot;Ranger&quot; battle group (with Commander, Carrier Group One embarked on as Commander, Naval Forces), the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; battle group, an amphibious task unit including , , , and MV &quot;Lummus&quot;, and three ships from MPSRON TWO (MV &quot;Anderson&quot;, MV &quot;Bonnyman&quot;, and MV &quot;Phillips&quot;). Other events led to the departure of the carriers and, as a result, Commander, Naval Forces responsibilities devolved first to Commander, Carrier Group Three, on &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, and thence to Commander, Amphibious Group Three. Finally Commander, Amphibious Squadron 3 became COMNAVFOR on 15 January with the departure of COMPHIGRU THREE after the completion of the MPF offload. (CNA, 1994, 168)

In 1995, Pacific Fleet surface ships were reshuffled. Effective 1 October 1995, the U.S. Pacific Fleet&#x27;s surface ships were to be reorganized into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons. Permanent core battle groups were to include a battle group commander, aircraft carrier, carrier air wing and at least two cruisers.
* Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1/USS &quot;Constellation&quot; Battle Group: and 
* ComCruDesGru 3/USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; Battle Group: , and 
* ComCruDesGru 5/USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; Battle Group: and 
* Commander Carrier Group 7 (ComCarGru 7)/USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; Battle Group: and 
* ComCar Gru 3/USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; Battle Group: and 
* Commander Carrier Group Five/USS &quot;Independence&quot; Battle Group: and 

Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific:
* Destroyer Squadron 1: , , , , , , and 
* Destroyer Squadron 5: , , , , 
* Destroyer Squadron 7: , , , and 
* Destroyer Squadron 9: , , , , and 
* Destroyer Squadron 15: , , , , , and 
* Destroyer Squadron 21: , , , , and 
* Destroyer Squadron 23: , , , , and 
* Destroyer Squadron 31: , , and 

In 1996 two carrier battle groups were sent to the Taiwan area during the Third Taiwan Straits Crisis. Later ships of the Pacific Fleet, notably , a , provided support to the entry of INTERFET in East Timor in 1999.

Between 25 and 27 March 2006, Carrier Strike Group Nine participated in a series of anti-submarine warfare exercises (ASW) in Hawaiian waters while en route to the U.S. Seventh Fleet&#x27;s area of responsibility. In addition to the strike group, the exercise also included the nuclear-powered attack submarines , , , , and , as well as land-based P-3 Orion aircraft from Commander Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 2 and associated patrol squadrons VP-4, VP-9, and VP-47.

<text>&#x27; (; &quot;love song&quot;) was a tradition of German lyric- and song-writing that flourished in the Middle High German period (12th to 14th centuries). The name derives from &quot;&quot;, the Middle High German word for love, as that was &quot;Minnesang&quot;&#x27;s main subject. People who wrote and performed &quot;Minnesang&quot; were known as Minnesänger (), and a single song was called a Minnelied&quot;&quot;&#x27; (). The &quot;Minnesänger&quot; are comparable to the Occitan troubadours and northern French &quot;trouvères,&quot; but they are &quot;an original German contribution to courtly lyric.&quot;

==Social status==
In the absence of reliable biographical information, there has been debate about the social status of the &quot;Minnesänger&quot;. Some clearly belonged to the higher nobility – the 14th-century Codex Manesse includes songs by dukes, counts, kings, and the Emperor Henry VI. Some &quot;Minnesänger&quot;, as indicated by the title &quot;Meister&quot; (master), were clearly educated commoners, such as Meister Konrad von Würzburg. It is thought that many were &quot;ministeriales&quot;, that is, members of a class of lower nobility, vassals of the great lords. Broadly speaking, the &quot;Minnesänger&quot; were writing and performing for their own social class at court, and should be thought of as courtiers rather than professional hired musicians. Friedrich von Hausen, for example, was part of the entourage of Friedrich Barbarossa, and died on crusade. As a reward for his service, Walther von der Vogelweide was given a fief by the Emperor Frederick II.

Several of the best-known &quot;Minnesänger&quot; are also noted for their epic poetry, among them Heinrich von Veldeke, Wolfram von Eschenbach and Hartmann von Aue.

==History==
The earliest texts date from perhaps 1150, and the earliest named &quot;Minnesänger&quot; are Der von Kürenberg and Dietmar von Aist, clearly writing in a native German tradition in the third quarter of the 12th century. This is referred to as the Danubian tradition.

From around 1170, German lyric poets came under the influence of the Provençal troubadours and the French &quot;trouvères&quot;. This is most obvious in the adoption of the strophic form of the canzone, at its most basic a seven-line strophe with the rhyme scheme AB AB CXC, and an AAB musical structure (denoting the repetition of large segments), but capable of many variations.

A number of songs from this period match &quot;trouvère&quot; originals exactly in form, indicating that the German text could have been sung to an originally French tune. For example, Friedrich von Hausen&#x27;s &quot;Ich denke underwilen&quot; is regarded as a contrafactum of Guiot de Provins&#x27;s &quot;Ma joie premeraine&quot;.

By around 1190, the German poets began to break free of Franco-Provençal influence. This period is regarded as the period of Classical &quot;Minnesang&quot; with Albrecht von Johansdorf, Heinrich von Morungen, Reinmar von Hagenau developing new themes and forms, reaching its culmination in Walther von der Vogelweide, regarded both in the Middle Ages and in the present day as the greatest of the &quot;Minnesänger&quot;.

The later &quot;Minnesang&quot;, from around 1230, is marked by a partial turning away from the refined ethos of classical &quot;Minnesang&quot; and by increasingly elaborate formal developments. The most notable of these later &quot;Minnesänger&quot;, Neidhart von Reuental introduces characters from lower social classes and often aims for humorous effects.

==Melodies==

Only a small number of &quot;Minnelied&quot; melodies have survived to the present day, mainly in manuscripts dating from the 15th century or later, which may present the songs in a form other than the original one. Additionally, it is often rather difficult to interpret the musical notation used to write them down. Although the contour of the melody can usually be made out, the rhythm of the song is frequently hard to fathom.

==Later developments==
In the 15th century, &quot;Minnesang&quot; developed into and gave way to the tradition of the Meistersänger. The two traditions are quite different, however; &quot;Minnesänger&quot; were mainly aristocrats, while Meistersänger usually were commoners.

At least two operas have been written about the &quot;Minnesang&quot; tradition: Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Guntram&quot;.

<text>Pentium 4 is a series of single-core CPUs for desktops, laptops and entry-level servers manufactured by Intel. The processors were shipped from November 20, 2000 until August 8, 2008. All Pentium 4 CPUs are based on the NetBurst microarchitecture, the successor to the P6.

The Pentium 4 Willamette (180 nm) introduced SSE2, while the Prescott (90 nm) introduced SSE3 and later 64-bit technology. Later versions introduced Hyper-Threading Technology (HTT). The first Pentium 4-branded processor to implement 64-bit was the Prescott (90 nm) (February 2004), but this feature was not enabled. Intel subsequently began selling 64-bit Pentium 4s using the &quot;&quot;E0&quot; revision&quot; of the Prescotts, being sold on the OEM market as the Pentium 4, model F. The E0 revision also adds eXecute Disable (XD) (Intel&#x27;s name for the NX bit) to Intel 64. Intel&#x27;s official launch of Intel 64 (under the name EM64T at that time) in mainstream desktop processors was the N0 stepping Prescott-2M.

Intel also marketed a version of their low-end Celeron processors based on the NetBurst microarchitecture (often referred to as &quot;Celeron 4&quot;), and a high-end derivative, Xeon, intended for multi-socket servers and workstations. In 2005, the Pentium 4 was complemented by the more advanced dual-core-brands Pentium D and Pentium Extreme Edition, all were succeeded at the top range by the Core 2 brand, while production continued until 2008, with Pentium 4 replaced by Pentium Dual-Core.

==Microarchitecture==

In benchmark evaluations, the advantages of the NetBurst microarchitecture were unclear. With carefully optimized application code, the first Pentium 4s outperformed Intel&#x27;s fastest Pentium III (clocked at 1.13 GHz at the time), as expected. But in legacy applications with many branching or x87 floating-point instructions, the Pentium 4 would merely match or run slower than its predecessor. Its main downfall was a shared unidirectional bus. The NetBurst microarchitecture consumed more power and emitted more heat than any previous Intel or AMD microarchitectures.

As a result, the Pentium 4&#x27;s introduction was met with mixed reviews: Developers disliked the Pentium 4, as it posed a new set of code optimization rules. For example, in mathematical applications, AMD&#x27;s lower-clocked Athlon (the fastest-clocked model was clocked at 1.2 GHz at the time) easily outperformed the Pentium 4, which would only catch up if software was re-compiled with SSE2 support. Tom Yager of &quot;Infoworld&quot; magazine called it &quot;the fastest CPUfor programs that fit entirely in cache&quot;. Computer-savvy buyers avoided Pentium 4 PCs due to their price premium, questionable benefit, and initial restriction to Rambus&#x27; RDRAM. In terms of product marketing, the Pentium 4&#x27;s singular emphasis on clock frequency (above all else) made it a marketer&#x27;s dream. The result of this was that the NetBurst microarchitecture was often referred to as a marchitecture by various computing websites and publications during the life of the Pentium 4. It was also called &quot;NetBust&quot;, a term popular with reviewers who reflected negatively upon the processor&#x27;s performance.

The two classical metrics of CPU performance are instructions per cycle (IPC) and clock speed. While IPC is difficult to quantify due to dependence on the benchmark application&#x27;s instruction mix, clock speed is a simple measurement yielding a single absolute number. Unsophisticated buyers would simply consider the processor with the highest clock speed to be the best product, and the Pentium 4 had the fastest clock speed. Because AMD&#x27;s processors had slower clock speeds, it countered Intel&#x27;s marketing advantage with the &quot;megahertz myth&quot; campaign. AMD product marketing used a &quot;PR-rating&quot; system, which assigned a merit value based on relative performance to a baseline machine.

At the launch of the Pentium 4, Intel stated that NetBurst-based processors were expected to scale to 10 GHz after several fabrication process generations. However, the clock speed of processors using the NetBurst microarchitecture reached a maximum of 3.8 GHz. Intel had not anticipated a rapid upward scaling of transistor power leakage that began to occur as the die reached the 90 nm lithography and smaller. This new power leakage phenomenon, along with the standard thermal output, created cooling and clock scaling problems as clock speeds increased. Reacting to these unexpected obstacles, Intel attempted several core redesigns (Prescott most notably) and explored new manufacturing technologies, such as using multiple cores, increasing FSB speeds, increasing the cache size, and using a longer instruction pipeline along with higher clock speeds.

The code cache was replaced by a trace cache which contained decoded microoperations rather than instructions with advantage of eliminating instruction decoding bottleneck so that the design can use RISC technology. This came with a disadvantage of less compact cache taking up more chip space and consuming power.

These solutions failed, and from 2003 to 2005, Intel shifted development away from NetBurst to focus on the cooler-running Pentium M microarchitecture. On January 5, 2006, Intel launched the Core processors, which put greater emphasis on energy efficiency and performance per clock cycle. The final NetBurst-derived products were released in 2007, with all subsequent product families switching exclusively to the Core microarchitecture.

=== Testing and validation ===
According to Bob Bentley, presenting on behalf of Intel at the 38th annual Design Automation Conference, &quot;The microarchitecture of the Pentium 4 processor is significantly more complex than any previous IA-32 microprocessor, so the challenge of validating the logical correctness of the design in a timely fashion was indeed a daunting one.&quot; He hired a team of 60 recent graduates to help with testing and validation.

==Processor cores==

Pentium 4 processors have an integrated heat spreader (IHS) that prevents the die from accidentally being damaged when mounting and unmounting cooling solutions. Prior to the IHS, a CPU shim was some times used by people worried about damaging the core. Overclockers sometimes removed the IHS from Socket 423 and Socket 478 chips to allow for more direct heat transfer. On Socket 478 Prescott processors and processors using the Socket LGA 775 (Socket T) interface, the IHS is directly soldered to the die or dies, making it difficult to remove.

===Willamette===

Willamette, the project codename for the first NetBurst microarchitecture implementation, experienced long delays in the completion of its design process. The project was started in 1998, when Intel saw the Pentium II as their permanent line. At that time, the Willamette core was expected to operate at frequencies up to about 1 GHz. However, the Pentium III was released while Willamette was still being finished. Due to the radical differences between the P6 and NetBurst microarchitectures, Intel could not market Willamette as a Pentium III, so it was marketed as the Pentium 4.

On November 20, 2000, Intel released the Willamette-based Pentium 4 clocked at 1.4 and 1.5 GHz. Most industry experts regarded the initial release as a stopgap product, introduced before it was truly ready. According to these experts, the Pentium 4 was released because the competing Thunderbird-based AMD Athlon was outperforming the aging Pentium III, and further improvements to the Pentium III were not yet possible. This Pentium 4 was produced using a 180 nm process and initially used Socket 423 (also called socket W, for &quot;Willamette&quot;), with later revisions moving to Socket 478 (socket N, for &quot;Northwood&quot;). These variants were identified by the Intel product codes 80528 and 80531 respectively.

On the test bench, the Willamette was somewhat disappointing to analysts in that not only was it unable to outperform the Athlon and the highest-clocked Pentium IIIs in all testing situations, but it was not superior to the budget segment&#x27;s AMD Duron. Although introduced at prices of $644 (1.4 GHz) and $819 (1.5 GHz) for 1000 quantities to OEM PC manufacturers (prices for models for the consumer market varied by retailer), it sold at a modest but respectable rate, handicapped somewhat by the requirement for relatively fast yet expensive Rambus Dynamic RAM (RDRAM). The Pentium III remained Intel&#x27;s top selling processor line, with the Athlon also selling slightly better than the Pentium 4. While Intel bundled two RDRAM modules with each boxed Pentium 4, it did not facilitate Pentium 4 sales and was not considered a true solution by many.

In January 2001, a still slower 1.3 GHz model was added to the range, but over the next twelve months, Intel gradually started reducing AMD&#x27;s leadership in performance. In April 2001 a 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 was launched, the first model to provide performance clearly superior to the old Pentium III. July saw 1.6 and 1.8 GHz models and in August 2001, Intel released 1.9 and 2 GHz Pentium 4s. In the same month, they released the 845 chipset that supported much cheaper PC133 SDRAM instead of RDRAM. The fact that SDRAM was so much cheaper caused the Pentium 4&#x27;s sales to grow considerably. The new chipset allowed the Pentium 4 to quickly replace the Pentium III, becoming the top-selling mainstream processor on the market.

The Willamette code name is derived from the Willamette Valley region of Oregon, where a large number of Intel&#x27;s manufacturing facilities are located.

===Northwood===
In January 2002, Intel released Pentium 4s with a new core codenamed Northwood at speeds of 1.6 GHz, 1.8 GHz, 2 GHz and 2.2 GHz. Northwood (product code 80532) combined an increase in the L2 cache size from 256 KB to 512 KB (increasing the transistor count from 42 million to 55 million) with a transition to a new 130 nm fabrication process. Making the processor out of smaller transistors means that it can run at higher clock speeds and produce less heat. In the same month boards utilizing the 845 chipset were released with enabled support for DDR SDRAM which provided double the bandwidth of PC133 SDRAM, and alleviated the associated high costs of using Rambus RDRAM for maximal performance with Pentium 4.

A 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 was released on April 2, 2002, and the bus speed increased from 400 MT/s to 533 MT/s (133 MHz physical clock) for the 2.26 GHz, 2.4 GHz, and 2.53 GHz models in May, 2.66 GHz and 2.8 GHz models in August, and 3.06 GHz model in November. With Northwood, the Pentium 4 came of age. The battle for performance leadership remained competitive (as AMD introduced faster versions of the Athlon XP) but most observers agreed that the fastest-clocked Northwood-based Pentium 4 was usually ahead of its rival. This was particularly so in mid-2002, when AMD&#x27;s changeover to its 130 nm production process did not help the initial &quot;Thoroughbred A&quot; revision Athlon XP CPUs to clock high enough to overcome the advantages of Northwood in the 2.4 to 2.8 GHz range.

The 3.06 GHz Pentium 4 enabled Hyper-Threading Technology that was first supported in Foster-based Xeons. This began the convention of virtual processors (or virtual cores) under x86 by enabling multiple threads to be run at the same time on the same physical processor. By shuffling two (ideally differing) program instructions to simultaneously execute through a single physical processor core, the goal is to best utilize processor resources that would have otherwise been unused from the traditional approach of having these single instructions wait for each other to execute singularly through the core. This initial 3.06 GHz 533FSB Pentium 4 Hyper-Threading enabled processor was known as Pentium 4 HT and was introduced to mass market by Gateway in November 2002.

On April 14, 2003, Intel officially launched the new Pentium 4 HT processor. This processor used an 800 MT/s FSB (200 MHz physical clock), was clocked at 3 GHz, and had Hyper-Threading technology. This was meant to help the Pentium 4 better compete with AMD&#x27;s Opteron line of processors. Meanwhile, with the launch of the Athlon XP 3200+ in AMD&#x27;s desktop line, AMD increased the Athlon XP&#x27;s FSB speed from 333 MT/s to 400 MT/s, but it was not enough to hold off the new 3 GHz Pentium 4 HT. 

The Pentium 4 HT&#x27;s increase to a 200 MHz quad-pumped bus (200 x 4 = 800 MHz effective) greatly helped to satisfy the bandwidth requirements the NetBurst architecture desired for reaching optimal performance. While the Athlon XP architecture was less dependent on bandwidth, the bandwidth numbers reached by Intel were well out of range for the Athlon&#x27;s EV6 bus. Hypothetically, EV6 could have achieved the same bandwidth numbers, but only at speeds unreachable at the time. Intel&#x27;s higher bandwidth proved useful in benchmarks for streaming operations, and Intel marketing wisely capitalized on this as a tangible improvement over AMD&#x27;s desktop processors. Northwood 2.4 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 2.8 GHz variants were released on May 21, 2003. A 3.2 GHz variant was launched on June 23, 2003 and the final 3.4 GHz version arrived on February 2, 2004.

Overclocking early stepping Northwood cores yielded a startling phenomenon. While core voltage approaching 1.7 V and above would often allow substantial additional gains in overclocking headroom, the processor would slowly (over several months or even weeks) become more unstable over time with a degradation in maximum stable clock speed before dying and becoming totally unusable. This became known as &quot;Sudden Northwood Death Syndrome&quot; (SNDS), which was caused by electromigration.

====Pentium 4 M====
Also based on the Northwood core, the &quot;Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor - M&quot; (also known as the &quot;Pentium 4 M&quot;) was released on April 23, 2002, and included Intel&#x27;s SpeedStep and Deeper Sleep technologies. Its TDP is about 35 watts in most applications. This lowered power consumption was due to lowered core voltage, and other features mentioned previously.

Unlike the desktop Pentium 4, the Pentium 4 M did not feature an integrated heat spreader (IHS), and it operates at a lower voltage. The lower voltage means lower power consumption, and in turn less heat. However, according to Intel specifications, the Pentium 4 M had a maximum thermal junction temperature rating of 100 degrees C, approximately 40 degrees higher than the desktop Pentium 4.

====Mobile Pentium 4====
The &quot;Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor&quot; was released to address the problem of putting a full desktop Pentium 4 processor into a laptop, which some manufacturers were doing. The Mobile Pentium 4 used a 533 MT/s FSB, following the desktop Pentium 4&#x27;s evolution. Oddly, increasing the bus speed by 133 MT/s (33 MHz) caused a massive increase in TDPs, as mobile Pentium 4 processors emitted 59.8–70 W of heat, with the Hyper-Threading variants emitting 66.1–88 W. This allowed the mobile Pentium 4 to bridge the gap between the desktop Pentium 4 (up to 115 W TDP), and the Pentium 4 M (up to 35 W TDP).

Intel&#x27;s naming conventions made it difficult at the time of the processor&#x27;s release to identify the processor model. There was the Pentium III mobile chip, the Pentium 4 M, the Mobile Pentium 4, and then the Pentium M, which itself was based on the Pentium III and was significantly faster and more power-efficient than the former three.

===Northwood (Extreme Edition)===
In September 2003, at the Intel Developer Forum, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition (P4EE) was announced, just over a week before the launch of Athlon 64 and Athlon 64 FX. The design was mostly identical to Pentium 4 (to the extent that it would run in the same motherboards), but differed by an added 2 MB of level 3 cache. It shared the same Gallatin core as the Xeon MP, though in a Socket 478 form factor (as opposed to Socket 603 for the Xeon MP) and with an 800 MT/s bus, twice as fast as that of the Xeon MP.
While Intel maintained that the Extreme Edition was aimed at gamers, critics viewed it as an attempt to steal the Athlon 64&#x27;s launch thunder, nicknaming it the &quot;Emergency Edition&quot;. With a price tag of $1000, it was also referred to as the &quot;Expensive Edition&quot; and &quot;Extremely Expensive&quot;.

The added cache generally resulted in a noticeable performance increase in most processor intensive applications. Multimedia encoding and certain games benefited the most, with the Extreme Edition outperforming the Pentium 4, and even the two Athlon 64 variants, although the lower price and more balanced performance of the Athlon 64 (particularly the non-FX version) led to it usually being seen as the better value proposition. Nonetheless, the Extreme Edition did achieve Intel&#x27;s apparent aim, which was to prevent AMD from being the performance champion with the new Athlon 64, which was winning every single major benchmark over the existing Pentium 4s.

In January 2004, a 3.4 GHz version was released for Socket 478, and in Summer 2004 the CPU was released using the new Socket 775 (LGA 775). A slight performance increase was achieved in late 2004 by increasing the bus speed from 800 MT/s to 1066 MT/s, resulting in a 3.46 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition. By most metrics, this was on a per-clock basis the fastest single-core NetBurst processor that was ever produced, even outperforming many of its successor chips (not counting the dual-core Pentium D). Afterwards, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was migrated to the Prescott core. The new 3.73 GHz Extreme Edition had the same features as a 6x0-sequence Prescott 2M, but with a 1066 MT/s bus. In practice however, the 3.73 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition almost always proved to be slower than the 3.46 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition, which is most likely due to the lack of an L3 cache and the longer instruction pipeline. The only advantage the 3.73 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition had over the 3.46 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was the ability to run 64-bit applications since all Gallatin-based Pentium 4 Extreme Edition processors lacked the Intel 64 (then known as EM64T) instruction set.

Although never a particularly good seller, especially since it was released in a time when AMD was asserting near total dominance in the processor performance race, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition established a new position within Intel&#x27;s product line, that of an enthusiast oriented chip with the highest-end specifications offered by Intel chips, along with unlocked multipliers to allow for easier overclocking. In this role it has since been succeeded by the Pentium Extreme Edition (The Extreme version of the dual-core Pentium D), the Core 2 Extreme, the Core i7 and the Core i9.

Contrary to popular belief, however, the Socket 478 versions of the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition CPUs such as the Gallatin-based Pentium 4 Extreme Edition for Socket 478 all have a locked multiplier, meaning that they are not overclockable unless the front-side bus speeds are increased (which runs the potential risks of erratic behaviors such as reliability and stability issues). Only the Socket 775/LGA 775 versions of the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition, as well as the Pentium Extreme Edition (Smithfield) and Engineering Sample CPUs have unlocked multipliers.

===Prescott===
On February 1, 2004, Intel introduced a new core codenamed Prescott. The core used the 90 nm process for the first time, which one analyst described as &quot;a major reworking of the Pentium 4&#x27;s microarchitecture.&quot; Despite this overhaul, the performance gains were inconsistent. Some programs benefited from Prescott&#x27;s doubled cache and SSE3 instructions, whereas others were harmed by its longer pipeline. The Prescott&#x27;s microarchitecture allowed slightly higher clock speeds, but not nearly as high as Intel had anticipated. The fastest mass-produced Prescott-based Pentium 4s were clocked at 3.8 GHz. While Northwood ultimately achieved clock speeds 70% higher than Willamette, Prescott only scaled 12% beyond Northwood. Prescott&#x27;s inability to achieve greater clock speeds was attributed to the very high power consumption and heat output of the processor. This led to the processor receiving the nickname &quot;PresHot&quot; on forums. In fact, Prescott&#x27;s power and heat characteristics were only slightly higher than those of Northwood of the same speed and nearly equal to the Gallatin-based Extreme Editions, but since those processors had already been operating near the limits of what was considered thermally acceptable, this still posed a major issue.

The release of Prescott also coincided with the launch of LGA 775 and the BTX form factor, which were also criticized. Tests showed that a given Pentium 4 made for LGA 775 consumed more power and produced more heat than the exact same chip in a socket 478 package. The BTX form factor, meanwhile, showed signs of having been designed for the sole purpose of managing the Prescott&#x27;s heat output at the expense of other components and concerns, such as blowing hot air from the CPU directly into the graphics card&#x27;s heatsink/fan. These magnified the perception of Prescott as an excessively hot chip.

The Prescott Pentium 4 contains 125 million transistors and has a die area of 112 mm2. It was fabricated in a 90 nm process with seven levels of copper interconnect. The process has features such as strained silicon transistors and low-κ carbon-doped silicon oxide (CDO) dielectric, which is also known as organosilicate glass (OSG). The Prescott was first fabricated at the D1C development fab and was later moved to F11X production fab.

Originally, Intel released two Prescott lines on Socket 478: the E-series, with an 800 MT/s FSB and Hyper-Threading support, and the low-end A-series, with a 533 MT/s FSB and Hyper-Threading disabled. LGA 775 Prescott CPUs use a rating system, labeling them as the 5xx series (Celeron Ds are the 3xx series, while Pentium Ms are the 7xx series). The LGA 775 version of the E-series uses model numbers 5x0 (520–560), and the LGA 775 version of the A-series uses model numbers 5x5 and 5x9 (505–519). The fastest, the 570J and 571, is clocked at 3.8 GHz. Plans to mass-produce a 4 GHz Pentium 4 were cancelled by Intel in favor of dual core processors, although some European retailers claimed to be selling a Pentium 4 580, clocked at 4 GHz. The E-series Prescott, as well as the low-end 517 and 524, incorporates Hyper-Threading in order to speed up some processes that use multithreaded software, such as video editing.

The Prescott microarchitecture was designed to support Intel 64, Intel&#x27;s implementation of the AMD-developed x86-64 64-bit extensions to the x86 architecture, but the initial models shipped with their 64-bit capability disabled. Intel stated that it did not intend to release 64-bit CPUs in retail channels, instead releasing the 64-bit capable F-series to OEMs only. However, they were later made available to the general public as the 5x1 series. A number of low-end Intel 64-enabled Prescotts, with 533 MHz FSB speed, were also released.

The E0 stepping of the Prescott series introduced the XD bit feature. This technology, introduced to the x86 architecture by AMD as NX (No eXecute), can help prevent certain types of malicious code from exploiting a buffer overflow to get executed. Models supporting XD bit include the 5x0J and 5x1 series as well as the low-end 5x5J and 5x6.

The Prescott processors are the first to support SSE3, along with all Pentium D processors.

====Prescott 2M (Extreme Edition)====
Intel, by the first quarter of 2005, released a new Prescott core with 6x0 numbering, codenamed Prescott 2M. It is also sometimes known by the name of its Xeon derivative, Irwindale. It features Hyper-Threading, Intel 64, the XD bit, EIST (Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology), Thermal Monitor 2 (for processors at 3.6 GHz and above), and 2 MB of L2 cache. However, AnandTech found that this resulted in 17% higher cache latency compared to Prescott, which combined with the lack of consumer-targeted programs requiring more cache, largely negated the advantage that added cache introduced. Rather than being a targeted speed boost the double size cache was intended to provide the same space and hence performance for 64-bit mode operations, due to the doubled word size compared to 32-bit mode.

On November 14, 2005, Intel released Prescott 2M processors with VT (Virtualization Technology, codenamed Vanderpool) enabled. Intel only released two models of this Prescott 2M category: 662 and 672, running at 3.6 GHz and 3.8 GHz, respectively.

===Cedar Mill===

The final revision of the Pentium 4 was &quot;Cedar Mill&quot;, released on January 5, 2006. This was a die shrink of the Prescott-based 600 series core to 65 nm, with no real feature additions but significantly reduced power consumption. The Cedar Mill is closely linked to the Pentium D Presler revision, with each Presler CPU consisting of two Cedar Mill cores on the same chip package. Cedar Mill had a lower heat output than Prescott, with a TDP of 86 W. The D0 stepping in late 2006 reduced this to 65 watts. It has a 65 nm core and features the same 31-stage pipeline as Prescott, 800 MT/s FSB, Intel 64, Hyper-Threading, but no Virtualization Technology. As with Prescott 2M, Cedar Mill also has a 2 MB L2 cache.

Intel initially announced four VT-x enabled Cedar Mill processors with model numbers 633 to 663, but these were later cancelled and replaced by models 631 to 661 without VT-x, the extra 1 added to the model number distinguishing them from the 90 nm Prescott cores operating at the same frequencies. Cedar Mill processors ranged in frequency from 3.0 to 3.6 GHz, down from the 3.8 GHz maximum of the Prescott-based 670 and 672. Overclockers managed to exceed 8 GHz with these processors using liquid nitrogen cooling.

The name &quot;Cedar Mill&quot; refers to Cedar Mill, Oregon, an unincorporated community near Intel&#x27;s Hillsboro, Oregon facilities.

==Successor==

In March 2003, the Pentium 4 M (the mobile version of the Pentium 4) was discontinued after suffering from heat and power consumption problems and was replaced by the P6-based Pentium M. The Pentium M forms a part of the Centrino platform-marketing brand throughout the 2000s.

In May 2005, Intel released dual-core processors under the Pentium D and Pentium Extreme Edition brands. These came under the code names Smithfield and Presler for the 90 nm and 65 nm parts respectively.

The original successor to the Pentium 4 was (codenamed) Tejas, which was scheduled for an early-mid-2005 release. However, it was cancelled a few months after the release of Prescott due to extremely high TDPs (a 2.8 GHz Tejas emitted 150 W of heat, compared to around 80 W for a Northwood of the same speed, and 100 W for a comparably clocked Prescott) and development on the NetBurst microarchitecture as a whole ceased, with the exception of the dual-core Pentium D, Pentium Extreme Edition and the Cedar Mill-based Pentium 4 HT.

The real successor to the Pentium 4 brand is the Pentium Dual-Core brand, released in 2006. The first chips implementing it (in 65 nm) were released in January 2007 with the Yonah mobile processors and are based on the Enhanced Pentium M architecture, in June 3, 2007 with the Allendale (and later Conroe) desktop processors and in late 2007 with the Merom mobile processors, with the underlying microarchitecture being the Core microarchitecture.

<text>The Pentium II is a brand of sixth-generation Intel x86 microprocessors based on the P6 microarchitecture, introduced on May 7, 1997. It combined the &quot;P6&quot; microarchitecture seen on the Pentium Pro with the MMX instruction set of the Pentium MMX.

Containing 7.5 million transistors (27.4 million in the case of the mobile Dixon with 256 KB on-die L2 cache), the Pentium II featured an improved version of the first &quot;P6&quot;-generation core of the Pentium Pro, which contained 5.5 million transistors. However, its L2 cache subsystem was a downgrade when compared to the Pentium Pro&#x27;s. In 1998, Intel stratified the Pentium II family by releasing the Pentium II-based Celeron line of processors for low-end computers and the Intel Pentium II Xeon line for servers and workstations. The Celeron was characterized by a reduced or omitted (in some cases present but disabled) on-die full-speed L2 cache and a 66 MT/s FSB. The Xeon was characterized by a range of full-speed L2 cache (from 512 KB to 2048 KB), a 100 MT/s FSB, a different physical interface (Slot 2), and support for symmetric multiprocessing.

In February 1999, the Pentium II was replaced by the nearly identical Pentium III, which only added the then-new SSE instruction set. However, the older family would continue to be produced until June 2001 for desktop units, September 2001 for mobile units, and the end of 2003 for embedded devices.

==Overview==
The Pentium II microprocessor was largely based upon the microarchitecture of its predecessor, the Pentium Pro, but with some significant improvements.

Unlike previous Pentium and Pentium Pro processors, the Pentium II CPU was packaged in a slot-based module rather than a CPU socket. The processor and associated components were carried on a daughterboard similar to a typical expansion board within a plastic cartridge. A fixed or removable heatsink was carried on one side, sometimes using its own fan.

This larger package was a compromise allowing Intel to separate the secondary cache from the processor while still keeping it on a closely coupled back-side bus. The L2 cache ran at half the processor&#x27;s clock frequency, unlike the Pentium Pro, whose off die L2 cache ran at the same frequency as the processor. However, its associativity was increased to 16-way (compared to 4-way on the Pentium Pro) and its size was always 512 KB, twice of the smallest option of 256 KB on the Pentium Pro. Off-package cache solved the Pentium Pro&#x27;s low yield issues, allowing Intel to introduce the Pentium II at a mainstream price level.

Intel improved 16-bit code execution performance on the Pentium II, an area in which the Pentium Pro was at a notable handicap, by adding segment register caches. Most consumer software of the day was still using at least some 16-bit code, because of a variety of factors. The issues with partial registers was also addressed by adding an internal flag to skip pipeline flushes whenever possible. To compensate for the slower L2 cache, the Pentium II featured 32 KB of L1 cache, double that of the Pentium Pro, as well as 4 write buffers (vs. 2 on the Pentium Pro); these can also be used by either pipeline, instead of each one being fixed to one pipeline. The Pentium II was also the first P6-based CPU to implement the Intel MMX integer SIMD instruction set which had already been introduced on the Pentium MMX.

The Pentium II was a more consumer-oriented version of the Pentium Pro. It was cheaper to manufacture because of the separate, slower L2 cache memory. The improved 16-bit performance and MMX support made it a better choice for consumer-level operating systems, such as Windows 9x, and multimedia applications. The slower and cheaper L2 cache&#x27;s performance penalty was mitigated by the doubled L1 cache and architectural improvements for legacy code. General processor performance was increased while costs were cut.

All &quot;Klamath&quot; and some early &quot;Deschutes&quot; Pentium IIs use a combined L2 cache controller / tag RAM chip that only allows for 512 MB to be cached; while more RAM could be installed in theory, this would result in very slow performance. While this limit was practically irrelevant for the average home user at the time, it was a concern for some workstation or server users. Presumably, Intel put this limitation deliberately in place to distinguish the Pentium II from the more upmarket Pentium Pro line, which has a full 4 GB cacheable area. The &#x27;82459AD&#x27; revision of the chip on some 333 MHz and all 350 MHz and faster Pentium IIs lifted this restriction and also offered a full 4 GB cacheable area.

==Variants==
===Klamath===
The original &quot;Klamath&quot; Pentium II microprocessor (Intel product code 80522) ran at 233, 266, and 300 MHz and was produced in a 0.35 μm process. The 300 MHz version, however, only became available in large quantities later in 1997. These CPUs had a 66 MHz front-side bus and were initially used on motherboards equipped with the aging Intel 440FX &quot;Natoma&quot; chipset designed for the Pentium Pro. Pentium II-based systems using the Intel 440LX &quot;Balboa&quot; chipset widely popularized SDRAM (which was to replace EDO RAM and was already introduced with 430VX), and the AGP graphics bus.

On July 14, 1997, Intel announced a version of the Pentium II &quot;Klamath&quot; with 2× 72-bit ECC L2 cache for entry-level servers, as opposed to the 2× 64-bit non-ECC L2 cache on regular models. The extra bits give it error-correction capability built into hardware, without impacting performance. The variant can be determined through the CPU part number.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Klamath CPUs are family 6, model 3.

===Deschutes===
The &quot;Deschutes&quot; core Pentium II (80523), which debuted at 333 MHz in January 1998, was produced with a 0.25 μm process and has a significantly lower power draw. The die size is 113 mm2. The 333 MHz variant was the final Pentium II CPU that used the older 66 MT/s front-side bus; all subsequent Deschutes-core models used a 100 MT/s FSB. Later in 1998, Pentium IIs running at 266, 300, 350, 400, and 450 MHz were also released. The &quot;Deschutes&quot; core introduced FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions for fast FPU context save and restore. Towards the end of its design life, Deschutes chips capable of 500 MHz within Intel cooling and design specifications were produced. However, these were not marketed. Rather than destroy already multiplier-locked units, those Deschutes units that had been tested and locked with a multiplier of 5 were sold as being 333 MHz. This was accomplished by disabling the 100 MHz bus option. Overclockers, upon learning of this, purchased the units in question and ran them well over 500 MHz; most notably, when overclocking, the final batch of &quot;333 MHz&quot; CPUs were capable of speeds much higher than CPUs sold at 350, 400, or 450 MHz.

Concurrent with the release of Deschutes cores supporting a 100 MT/s front-side bus was Intel&#x27;s release of the 440BX &quot;Seattle&quot; chipset and its derivatives, the 440MX, 450NX, and 440ZX chipsets. Replacing the aged 66 MHz FSB, which had been on the market since 1993, the 100 MHz FSB resulted in solid performance improvements for the Pentium II lineup. Pentium II chips starting with 350 MHz were released in both SECC and SECC2 form factors. Late Pentium IIs also marked the switch to flip-chip based packaging with direct heatsink contact to the die, as opposed to traditional bonding.

While &quot;Klamath&quot; features 4 cache chips and simulates dual-porting through interleaving (2x 64-bit) for a slight performance improvement on concurrent accesses, &quot;Deschutes&quot; only sports 2 cache chips and offers slightly lower L2 cache performance at the same clockspeed. Furthermore, &quot;Deschutes&quot; always features ECC-enabled L2 cache.
The Pentium II Xeon was a high-end version of Deschutes core intended for use on workstations and servers. Principally, it used a different type of slot (Slot 2), case, board design, and more expensive full-speed custom L2 cache, which was off-die. Versions were produced with 512 KB, 1 MB or 2 MB L2 caches by varying the number of 512 KB chips incorporated on the board.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Deschutes CPUs are family 6, model 5 and have the part number 80523.

====Pentium II OverDrive====
In 1998, the 0.25 μm Deschutes core was utilized in the creation of the Pentium II Overdrive processor, which was aimed at allowing corporate Pentium Pro users to upgrade their aging servers. Combining the Deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 KB full-speed L2 cache chip from the Pentium II Xeon into a Socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 MHz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 MHz front-side bus. This combination brought together some of the more attractive aspects of the Pentium II and the Pentium II Xeon: MMX support/improved 16-bit performance and full-speed L2 cache, respectively. The later &quot;Dixon&quot; mobile Pentium II would emulate this combination with 256 KB of full-speed cache.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, the Pentium II OverDrive CPU identifies itself as family 6, model 3, though this is misleading, as it is not based on the family 6/model 3 Klamath core. As mentioned in the Pentium II Processor update documentation from Intel, &quot;although this processor has a CPUID of 163xh, it uses a Pentium II processor CPUID 065xh processor core.&quot;

===Tonga===
The 0.25 μm &quot;Tonga&quot; core was the first mobile Pentium II and had all of the features of the desktop models.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Tonga CPUs are family 6, model 5.

===Dixon===

Later, in 1999, the 0.25; 0.18 (400 MHz) μm &quot;Dixon&quot; core with 256 KB of on-die full speed cache was produced for the mobile market. Reviews showed that the Dixon core was the fastest type of Pentium II produced.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Dixon CPUs are family 6, model 6 and their Intel product code is 80524. These identifiers are shared with the &quot;Mendocino&quot; Celeron processors.

<text>The Pentium III (marketed as Intel Pentium III Processor, informally PIII or P3) brand refers to Intel&#x27;s 32-bit x86 desktop and mobile CPUs based on the sixth-generation P6 microarchitecture introduced on February 28, 1999. The brand&#x27;s initial processors were very similar to the earlier Pentium II-branded processors. The most notable differences were the addition of the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instruction set (to accelerate floating point and parallel calculations), and the introduction of a controversial serial number embedded in the chip during manufacturing.

Even after the release of the Pentium 4 in late 2000, the Pentium III continued to be produced with new models introduced up until early 2003. They were then discontinued in April 2004 for desktop units and May 2007 for mobile units.

== Processor cores ==
Similarly to the Pentium II it superseded, the Pentium III was also accompanied by the Celeron brand for lower-end versions, and the Xeon for high-end (server and workstation) derivatives. The Pentium III was eventually superseded by the Pentium 4, but its Tualatin core also served as the basis for the Pentium M CPUs, which used many ideas from the P6 microarchitecture. Subsequently, it was the Pentium M microarchitecture of Pentium M branded CPUs, and not the NetBurst found in Pentium 4 processors, that formed the basis for Intel&#x27;s energy-efficient Core microarchitecture of CPUs branded Core 2, Pentium Dual-Core, Celeron (Core), and Xeon.

===Katmai===
The first Pentium III variant was the Katmai (Intel product code 80525). It was a further development of the Deschutes Pentium II. The Pentium III saw an increase of 2 million transistors over the Pentium II. The differences were the addition of execution units and SSE instruction support, and an improved L1 cache controller (the L2 cache controller was left unchanged, as it would be fully redesigned for Coppermine anyway), which were responsible for the minor performance improvements over the &quot;Deschutes&quot; Pentium IIs. It was first released at speeds of 450 and 500 MHz on February 28, 1999. Two more versions were released: 550 MHz on May 17, 1999 and 600 MHz on August 2, 1999. On September 27, 1999, Intel released the 533B and 600B running at 533 &amp; 600 MHz respectively. The &#x27;B&#x27; suffix indicated that it featured a 133 MT/s FSB, instead of the 100 MT/s FSB of prior models.

The Katmai contains 9.5 million transistors, not including the 512 Kbytes L2 cache (which adds 25 million transistors), and has dimensions of 12.3 mm by 10.4 mm (128 mm2). It is fabricated in Intel&#x27;s P856.5 process, a 250 nm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process with five levels of aluminum interconnect. The Katmai used the same slot-based design as the Pentium II but with the newer Slot 1 Single Edge Contact Cartridge (SECC) 2 that allowed direct CPU core contact with the heat sink. There have been some early models of the Pentium III with 450 and 500 MHz packaged in an older SECC cartridge intended for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

A notable stepping level for enthusiasts was SL35D. This version of Katmai was officially rated for 450 MHz, but often contained cache chips for the 600 MHz model and thus usually can run at 600 MHz.

===Coppermine===
The second version, codenamed Coppermine (Intel product code: 80526), was released on October 25, 1999 running at 500, 533, 550, 600, 650, 667, 700, and 733 MHz. From December 1999 to May 2000, Intel released Pentium IIIs running at speeds of 750, 800, 850, 866, 900, 933 and 1000 MHz (1 GHz). Both 100 MT/s FSB and 133 MT/s FSB models were made. For models that were already available with the same frequency, an &quot;E&quot; was appended to the model name to indicate cores using the new 180 nm fabrication process. An additional &quot;B&quot; was later appended to designate 133 MHz FSB models, resulting in an &quot;EB&quot; suffix. In overall performance, Coppermine had a small advantage over the Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Athlons it was released against, which was reversed when AMD applied their own die shrink and added an on-die L2 cache to the Athlon. Athlon held the advantage in floating-point intensive code, while the Coppermine could perform better when SSE optimizations were used, but in practical terms there was little difference in how the two chips performed, clock-for-clock. However, AMD were able to clock the Athlon higher, reaching speeds of 1.2 GHz before the launch of the Pentium 4.

In performance, Coppermine arguably marked a bigger step than Katmai by introducing an on-chip L2 cache, which Intel names &quot;Advanced Transfer Cache&quot; (ATC). The ATC operates at the core clock rate and has a capacity of 256 KB, twice that of the on-chip cache formerly on Mendocino Celerons. It is eight-way set-associative and is accessed via a &quot;Double Quad Word Wide&quot; 256-bit bus, four times as wide as Katmai&#x27;s. Further, latency was dropped to a quarter compared to Katmai. Another marketing term by Intel was &quot;Advanced System Buffering&quot;, which encompassed improvements to better take advantage of a 133 MT/s system bus. These include 6 fill buffers (vs. 4 on Katmai), 8 bus queue entries (vs. 4 on Katmai) and 4 write-back buffers (vs. 1 on Katmai). Under competitive pressure from the AMD Athlon, Intel reworked the internals, finally removing some well-known pipeline stalls. As a result, applications affected by the stalls ran faster on Coppermine by up to 30%. The Coppermine contained 29 million transistors and was fabricated in a 180 nm process.

The Coppermine was available in 370-pin FC-PGA or FC-PGA2 for use with Socket 370, or in SECC2 for Slot 1 (all speeds except 900 and 1100). FC-PGA and Slot 1 Coppermine CPUs have an exposed die, however most higher frequency SKUs starting with the 866 MHz model were also produced in FC-PGA2 variants that feature an integrated heat spreader (IHS). This in itself did not improve thermal conductivity, since it added another layer of metal and thermal paste between the die and the heatsink, but it greatly assisted in holding the heatsink flat against the die. Earlier Coppermines without the IHS made heatsink mounting challenging. If the heatsink was not situated flat against the die, heat transfer efficiency was greatly reduced. Some heatsink manufacturers began providing pads on their products, similar to what AMD did with the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; Athlon to ensure that the heatsink was mounted flatly. The enthusiast community went so far as to create shims to assist in maintaining a flat interface.

A 1.13 GHz version (S-Spec SL4HH) was released in mid-2000 but famously recalled after a collaboration between HardOCP and Tom&#x27;s Hardware discovered various instabilities with the operation of the new CPU speed grade. The Coppermine core was unable to reliably reach the 1.13 GHz speed without various tweaks to the processor&#x27;s microcode, effective cooling, higher voltage (1.75 V vs. 1.65 V), and specifically validated platforms. Intel only officially supported the processor on its own VC820 i820-based motherboard, but even this motherboard displayed instability in the independent tests of the hardware review sites. In benchmarks that were stable, performance was shown to be sub-par, with the 1.13 GHz CPU equalling a 1.0 GHz model. Tom&#x27;s Hardware attributed this performance deficit to relaxed tuning of the CPU and motherboard to improve stability. Intel needed at least six months to resolve the problems using a new cD0 stepping and re-released 1.1 GHz and 1.13 GHz versions in 2001.

Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox game console uses a variant of the Pentium III/Mobile Celeron family in a Micro-PGA2 form factor. The sSpec designator of the chips is SL5Sx, which makes it more similar to the Mobile Celeron Coppermine-128 processor. It shares with the Coppermine-128 Celeron its 128 KB L2 cache, and 180 nm process technology, but keeps the 8-way cache associativity from the Pentium III.

Although its codename could give the impression that it used copper interconnects, in reality, its interconnects were aluminium.

===Coppermine T===
This revision is an intermediate step between Coppermine and Tualatin, with support for lower-voltage system logic present on the latter but core power within previously defined voltage specs of the former so it could work in older system boards.

Intel used the latest FC-PGA2 Coppermines with the cD0 stepping and modified them so that they worked with low voltage system bus operation at 1.25 V AGTL as well as normal 1.5 V AGTL+ signal levels, and would auto detect differential or single-ended clocking. This modification made them compatible to the latest generation Socket 370 boards supporting Tualatin CPUs while maintaining compatibility with older Socket 370 boards. The Coppermine T also had two way symmetrical multiprocessing capabilities, but only in Tualatin boards.

They can be distinguished from Tualatin processors by their part numbers, which include the digits &quot;80533&quot;, e.g. the 1133 MHz SL5QK P/N is RK80533PZ006256, while the 1000 MHz SL5QJ P/N is RK80533PZ001256.

===Tualatin===
The third revision, Tualatin (80530), was a trial for Intel&#x27;s new 130 nm process. Tualatin-based Pentium IIIs were released during 2001 until early 2002 at speeds of 1.0, 1.13, 1.2, 1.26, 1.33 and 1.4 GHz. A basic shrink of Coppermine, no new features were added, except for added data prefetch logic similar to Pentium 4 and Athlon XP for potentially better use of the L2 cache, although its use compared to these newer CPUs is limited due to the relatively smaller FSB bandwidth (FSB was still kept at 133 MHz). Variants with 256 and 512 KB L2 cache were produced, the latter being dubbed Pentium III-S; this variant was mainly intended for low-power consumption servers and also exclusively featured SMP support within the Tualatin line.

Although the Socket 370 designation was kept, the use of 1.25 AGTL signaling in place of 1.5 V AGTL+ rendered prior motherboards incompatible. This confusion carried over to the chipset naming, where only the B-stepping of the i815 chipset was compatible with Tualatin processors. A new VRM guideline was also designed by Intel, version 8.5, which required finer voltage steps and debuted load line Vcore (in place of fixed voltage regardless of current on 8.4). Some motherboard manufacturers would mark the change with blue sockets (instead of white), and were often also backwards compatible with Coppermine CPUs.

The Tualatin also formed the basis for the highly popular Pentium III-M mobile processor, which became Intel&#x27;s front-line mobile chip (the Pentium 4 drew significantly more power, and so was not well-suited for this role) for the next two years. The chip offered a good balance between power consumption and performance, thus finding a place in both performance notebooks and the &quot;thin and light&quot; category.

The Tualatin-based Pentium III performed well in some applications compared to the fastest Willamette-based Pentium 4, and even the Thunderbird-based Athlons. Despite this, its appeal was limited due to the aforementioned incompatibility with existing systems, and Intel&#x27;s only officially supported chipset for Tualatins, the i815, could only handle 512 MB RAM as opposed to 1 GB of registered RAM with the older, incompatible 440BX chipset. However, the enthusiast community found a way to run Tualatins on then-ubiquitous BX chipset based boards, although it was often a non-trivial task and required some degree of technical skills.

Tualatin-based Pentium III CPUs can usually be visually distinguished from Coppermine-based processors by the metal integrated heat-spreader (IHS) fixed on top of the package. However, the last models of Coppermine Pentium IIIs also featured the IHS — the integrated heat spreader is actually what distinguishes the FC-PGA2 package from the FC-PGA — both are for Socket 370 motherboards.

Before the addition of the heat spreader, it was sometimes difficult to install a heatsink on a Pentium III. One had to be careful not to put force on the core at an angle because doing so would cause the edges and corners of the core to crack and could destroy the CPU. It was also sometimes difficult to achieve a flat mating of the CPU and heatsink surfaces, a factor of critical importance to good heat transfer. This became increasingly challenging with the Socket 370 CPUs, compared with their Slot 1 predecessors, because of the force required to mount a socket-based cooler and the narrower, 2-sided mounting mechanism (Slot 1 featured 4-point mounting). As such, and because the 130 nm Tualatin had an even smaller core surface area than the 180 nm Coppermine, Intel installed the metal heatspreader on Tualatin and all future desktop processors.

The Tualatin core was named after the Tualatin Valley and Tualatin River in Oregon, where Intel has large manufacturing and design facilities.

==Pentium III&#x27;s SSE implementation==

Since Katmai was built in the same 250 nm process as Pentium II &quot;Deschutes&quot;, it had to implement Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) using minimal silicon. To achieve this goal, Intel implemented the 128-bit architecture by double-cycling the existing 64-bit data paths and by merging the SIMD-FP multiplier unit with the x87 scalar FPU multiplier into a single unit. To utilize the existing 64-bit data paths, Katmai issues each SIMD-FP instruction as two μops. To compensate partially for implementing only half of SSE&#x27;s architectural width, Katmai implements the SIMD-FP adder as a separate unit on the second dispatch port. This organization allows one half of a SIMD multiply and one half of an independent SIMD add to be issued together bringing the peak throughput back to four floating point operations per cycle — at least for code with an even distribution of multiplies and adds.

The issue was that Katmai&#x27;s hardware-implementation contradicted the parallelism model implied by the SSE instruction-set. Programmers faced a code-scheduling dilemma: &quot;Should the SSE-code be tuned for Katmai&#x27;s limited execution resources, or should it be tuned for a future processor with more resources?&quot; Katmai-specific SSE optimizations yielded the best possible performance from the Pentium III family but was suboptimal for Coppermine onwards as well as future Intel processors, such as the Pentium 4 and Core series.

==Controversy about privacy issues==
The Pentium III was the first x86 CPU to include a unique, retrievable, identification number, called Processor Serial Number (PSN). A Pentium III&#x27;s PSN can be read by software through the CPUID instruction if this feature has not been disabled through the BIOS.

On November 29, 1999, the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) Panel of the European Parliament, following their report on electronic surveillance techniques asked parliamentary committee members to consider legal measures that would &quot;prevent these chips from being installed in the computers of European citizens.&quot;

Intel eventually removed the PSN feature from Tualatin-based Pentium IIIs, and the feature was absent in Pentium 4 and Pentium M.

A largely equivalent feature, the Protected Processor Identification Number (PPIN) was later added to x86 CPUs with little public notice, starting with Intel&#x27;s Ivy Bridge architecture and compatible Zen 2 AMD CPUs. It is implemented as a set of model-specific registers and is useful for machine check exception handling.

==Pentium III RNG (Random Number Generator)==
A new feature was added to the Pentium III: a hardware-based random number generator. It has been described as &quot;several oscillators combine their outputs and that odd waveform is sampled asynchronously.&quot;

<doc id="165231" wikidata="Q153867" url="?curid=165231" title="Triple Alliance (1882)">
<text>The Triple Alliance was a defensive military alliance between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. It was formed on 20 May 1882 and renewed periodically until it expired in 1915 during World War I. Germany and Austria-Hungary had been closely allied since 1879. Italy was looking for support against France shortly after it lost North African ambitions to the French. Each member promised mutual support in the event of an attack by any other great power. The treaty provided that Germany and Austria-Hungary were to assist Italy if it was attacked by France without provocation. In turn, Italy would assist Germany if attacked by France. In the event of a war between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Italy promised to remain neutral. Despite having nominally joined the Triple Alliance before, Italy did not take part in World War I on the side of the Central Powers and later joined on the side of the Allied Powers.

When the treaty was renewed in February 1887, Italy gained an empty promise of German support of Italian colonial ambitions in North Africa in return for Italy&#x27;s continued friendship. Austria-Hungary had to be pressured by German chancellor Otto von Bismarck into accepting the principles of consultation and mutual agreement with Italy on any territorial changes initiated in the Balkans or on the coasts and islands of the Adriatic and Aegean seas. Italy and Austria-Hungary did not overcome their basic conflict of interest in that region despite the treaty. In 1891, attempts were made to join Britain to the Triple Alliance, which, though unsuccessful, were widely believed to have succeeded in Russian diplomatic circles.

Shortly after renewing the Alliance in June 1902, Italy secretly extended a similar guarantee to France. By a particular agreement, neither Austria-Hungary nor Italy would change the status quo in the Balkans without previous consultation.

On 18 October 1883 Carol I of Romania, through his Prime Minister Ion C. Brătianu, had also secretly pledged to support the Triple Alliance, but he later remained neutral in the First World War due to viewing Austria-Hungary as the aggressor. On 1 November 1902, five months after the Triple Alliance was renewed, Italy reached an understanding with France that each would remain neutral in the event of an attack on the other.

When Austria-Hungary found itself at war in August 1914 with the rival Triple Entente, Italy proclaimed its neutrality, considering Austria-Hungary the aggressor. Italy also defaulted on the obligation to consult and agree to compensations before changing the status quo in the Balkans, as agreed in 1912 renewal of the Triple Alliance. Following parallel negotiation with both Triple Alliance (which aimed to keep Italy neutral) and the Triple Entente (which aimed to make Italy enter the conflict), Italy sided with the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary.

==Germany==
The man chiefly responsible for the Triple Alliance was Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor of Germany. His primary goal was to preserve the status quo in Europe after he had unified Germany in 1871. He was particularly concerned about France finding allies to help it regain Alsace-Lorraine. By promising to aid Austria-Hungary and Italy in the event of an attack, Bismarck sought to make them somewhat dependent on Germany and therefore unsympathetic to French adventures.

==Austria-Hungary==
By the late 1870s, Austrian territorial ambitions in both the Italian Peninsula and Central Europe had been thwarted by the rise of Italy and Germany as new powers. With the decline and the failed reforms of the Ottoman Empire, Slavic discontent in the occupied Balkans grew, which both Russia and Austria-Hungary saw as an opportunity to expand in the region. In 1876, Russia offered to partition the Balkans, but the Hungarian statesman Gyula Andrássy declined because Austria-Hungary was already a &quot;saturated&quot; state and could not cope with additional territories. The whole empire was thus drawn into a new style of diplomatic brinkmanship, which was first conceived of by Andrássy, centering on the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a predominantly-Slav area that was still under the control of the Ottoman Empire.

On the heels of the Great Balkan Crisis, Austro-Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 1878, and Austria-Hungary eventually annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908 as a common holding under the control of the finance ministry, rather than attaching it to either Austria or Hungary. The occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina was a step taken in response to Russian advances into Bessarabia. Unable to mediate between the Ottoman and the Russian Empires over the control of Serbia, Austria–Hungary declared neutrality when the conflict between the empires escalated into war. To counter Russian and French interests in Europe, an alliance was concluded with Germany in October 1879 and with Italy in May 1882.

==Italy==
Italy had several motives for joining the existing Austro-German alliance. The Italian government at that time was controlled by conservatives, who sympathized ideologically with the two monarchies. Also, Catholic Austria was a traditional protector of the Papacy, which Italy had poor relations with. However, perhaps most importantly, Italy was seeking potential allies against France. The Kingdom of Italy, like most of the other European powers, wanted to set up colonies and build up an overseas empire. Although France had supported Italian unification, Italy&#x27;s colonial ambitions in Africa quickly brought it into a rivalry with France. That was reflected in anger at the French conquest of Tunisia in 1881, the so-called &quot;Slap of Tunis&quot; by the Italian press, which many Italians had seen as a potential colony. By joining the Alliance, Italy hoped to guarantee itself support in case of foreign aggression. The main alliance compelled any signatory country to support the other parties if two other countries attacked. Germany had won a war against France in 1870 and was a natural ally for Italy. Thus, Italy found itself coming to terms with its historical enemy, Austria-Hungary, against which Italy had fought three wars in the 34 years before the signing of the first treaty.

However, Italian public opinion remained unenthusiastic about their country&#x27;s alignment with Austria-Hungary, a past enemy of Italian unification and whose Italian-populated districts in the Trentino and Istria were seen as occupied territories by Italian irredentists. In the years before World War I, many distinguished military analysts predicted that Italy would attack its supposed ally in the event of a large scale conflict. On its own hand, the Austro-Hungarian General Staff maintained at least from 1903 plans for a possible war against Rome. Mutual suspicions led to reinforcement of the frontier and speculation in the press about a war between the two countries into the first decade of the 20th century. As late as 1911, Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, the chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, was advocating a preemptive strike against Austria&#x27;s supposed Italian ally. That prediction was strengthened by Italy&#x27;s invasion and annexation of Libya, bringing it into conflict with the German-backed Ottoman Empire.

==Romania==
King Carol I of Romania was of German ancestry, which, combined with his wish to turn Romania into a centre of stability in Southeastern Europe and his fear of Russian expansion and the competing claims on Bessarabia, led to Romania secretly joining the Triple Alliance on 18 October 1883. Only the King and a handful of senior Romanian politicians knew about it. Romania and Austria-Hungary pledged to help each other in the event of a Russian, Serbian or Bulgarian attack. There were, however, several disputes between Romania and Hungary, the most notable being the status and community rights of Romanians in Transylvania. Romania eventually managed to achieve the status of regional power in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars and the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest, but less than a year later, World War I started, and Romania, after a period of neutrality in which both the Central Powers and the Allies tried persuading Romania to join their respective sides, eventually joined the Allies in 1916, after it had been promised significant Romanian-inhabited Hungarian lands. Romania&#x27;s official reason for not siding with the Triple Alliance when the war started was the same as Italy&#x27;s: The Triple Alliance was a defensive alliance, but Germany and Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive.

<text>The Pentium Pro is a sixth-generation x86 microprocessor developed and manufactured by Intel and introduced on November 1, 1995. It introduced the P6 microarchitecture (sometimes termed i686) and was originally intended to replace the original Pentium in a full range of applications. Later, it was reduced to a more narrow role as a server and high-end desktop processor. The Pentium Pro was also used in supercomputers, most notably ASCI Red, which used two Pentium Pro CPUs on each computing node and was the first computer to reach over one teraFLOPS in 1996, holding the number one spot in the TOP500 list from 1997 to 2000.

While the Pentium and Pentium MMX had 3.1 and 4.5 million transistors, respectively, the Pentium Pro contained 5.5 million transistors. It was capable of both dual- and quad-processor configurations and only came in one form factor, the relatively large rectangular Socket 8. The Pentium Pro was succeeded by the Pentium II Xeon in 1998.

==Microarchitecture==

The lead architect of Pentium Pro was Fred Pollack who was specialized in superscalarity and had also worked as the lead engineer of the Intel iAPX 432.

===Summary===
The Pentium Pro incorporated a new microarchitecture, different from the Pentium&#x27;s P5 microarchitecture. It has a decoupled, 14-stage superpipelined architecture which used an instruction pool.
The Pentium Pro (P6) implemented many radical architectural differences mirroring other contemporary x86 designs such as the NexGen Nx586 and Cyrix 6x86. The Pentium Pro pipeline had extra decode stages to dynamically translate IA-32 instructions into buffered micro-operation sequences which could then be analysed, reordered, and renamed in order to detect parallelizable operations that may be issued to more than one execution unit at once. The Pentium Pro thus featured out-of-order execution, including speculative execution via register renaming. It also had a wider 36-bit address bus, usable by Physical Address Extension (PAE), allowing it to access up to 64 GB of memory.

The Pentium Pro has an 8 KB instruction cache, from which up to 16 bytes are fetched on each cycle and sent to the instruction decoders. There are three instruction decoders. The decoders are unequal in ability: only one can decode any x86 instruction, while the other two can only decode simple x86 instructions. This restricts the Pentium Pro&#x27;s ability to decode multiple instructions simultaneously, limiting superscalar execution. x86 instructions are decoded into 118-bit micro-operations (micro-ops). The micro-ops are reduced instruction set computer (RISC)-like; that is, they encode an operation, two sources, and a destination. The general decoder can generate up to four micro-ops per cycle, whereas the simple decoders can generate one micro-op each per cycle. Thus, x86 instructions that operate on the memory (e.g., add this register to this location in the memory) can only be processed by the general decoder, as this operation requires a minimum of three micro-ops. Likewise, the simple decoders are limited to instructions that can be translated into one micro-op. Instructions that require more micro-ops than four are translated with the assistance of a sequencer, which generates the required micro-ops over multiple clock cycles. The Pentium Pro was the first processor in the x86 family to support upgradeable microcode under BIOS and/or operating system (OS) control.

Micro-ops exit the re-order buffer (ROB) and enter a reserve station (RS), where they await dispatch to the execution units. In each clock cycle, up to five micro-ops can be dispatched to five execution units. The Pentium Pro has a total of six execution units: two integer units, one floating-point unit (FPU), a load unit, store address unit, and a store data unit. One of the integer units shares the same ports as the FPU, and therefore the Pentium Pro can only dispatch one integer micro-op and one floating-point micro-op, or two integer micro-ops per a cycle, in addition to micro-ops for the other three execution units. Of the two integer units, only the one that shares the path with the FPU on port 0 has the full complement of functions such as a barrel shifter, multiplier, divider, and support for LEA instructions. The second integer unit, which is connected to port 1, does not have these facilities and is limited to simple operations such as add, subtract, and the calculation of branch target addresses.

The FPU executes floating-point operations. Addition and multiplication are pipelined and have a latency of three and five cycles, respectively. Division and square-root are not pipelined and are executed in separate units that share the FPU&#x27;s ports. Division and square root have a latency of 18-36 and 29-69 cycles, respectively. The smallest number is for single precision (32-bit) floating-point numbers and the largest for extended precision (80-bit) numbers. Division and square root can operate simultaneously with adds and multiplies, preventing them from executing only when the result has to be stored in the ROB.

After the microprocessor was released, a bug was discovered in the floating point unit, commonly called the &quot;Pentium Pro and Pentium II FPU bug&quot; and by Intel as the &quot;flag erratum&quot;. The bug occurs under some circumstances during floating point-to-integer conversion when the floating point number will not fit into the smaller integer format, causing the FPU to deviate from its documented behaviour. The bug is considered to be minor and occurs under such special circumstances that very few, if any, software programs are affected.

The Pentium Pro P6 microarchitecture was used in one form or another by Intel for more than a decade. The pipeline would scale from its initial 150 MHz start, all the way up to 1.4 GHz with the &quot;Tualatin&quot; Pentium III. The design&#x27;s various traits would continue after that in the derivative core called &quot;Banias&quot; in Pentium M and Intel Core (Yonah), which itself would evolve into the Core microarchitecture (Core 2 processor) in 2006 and onward.

===Instruction set===

The Pentium Pro (P6) introduced new &#x27;conditional move&#x27; instructions into the Intel range; the codice_1 and codice_2 (‘conditional move’) instructions fetch a source value from a register or memory, and optionally write that value to a destination register according to a condition &quot;cc&quot; on the flags register, the same conditions used by the conditional jump (codice_3) instructions. For example, codice_4 moves a specified value into a register if the flags register matches the NE (not-equal) condition, i.e. the zero flag is unset. If the zero flag is set, the condition in false, and the destination register keeps its value. This allows simple if-then-else operations (such as commonly used by the codice_5 operation in C) without a costly conditional branch. The codice_2 variant provides the same functionality for floating-point registers. Unfortunately, codice_7 does not support immediate (in-line constant) source values nor memory destinations.

A second development was the documentation of the codice_8 illegal instruction. This op code is reserved and guaranteed to cause an illegal instruction exception on the P6 and all later processors. This allows developers to easily crash the current program in a future-proof fashion when a bug is detected by software.

===Performance===
Despite being advanced for the time, the Pentium Pro&#x27;s out-of-order register renaming architecture had trouble running 16-bit code and mixed code (8-bit with 16-bit (8/16), or 16-bit with 32-bit (16/32), as using partial registers cause frequent pipeline flushing. Specific use of partial registers was then a common performance optimization, as it incurred no performance penalty on pre-P6 Intel processors; also, the dominant operating systems at the time of the Pentium Pro&#x27;s release were 16-bit DOS, and mixed 16/32-bit Windows 3.1x and Windows 95 (although the latter requires a 32-bit 80386 CPU as a minimum, much of its code is still 16-bit for performance reasons, such as the 16-bit Windows USER dynamic link library, user.exe). This, along with the high cost of Pentium Pro systems, led to tepid sales among PC buyers at the time. To fully use the Pentium Pro&#x27;s P6 microarchitecture, a fully 32-bit operating system is needed, such as Windows NT, Linux, Unix, or OS/2. The performance issues on legacy code were later partly mitigated by Intel with the Pentium II.

Compared to RISC microprocessors, the Pentium Pro, when introduced, slightly outperformed the fastest RISC microprocessors on integer performance when running the SPECint95 benchmark, but floating-point performance was significantly lower, half that of some RISC microprocessors. The Pentium Pro&#x27;s integer performance lead disappeared rapidly, first overtaken by the MIPS Technologies R10000 in January 1996, and then by Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s EV56 variant of the Alpha 21164.

Reviewers quickly noted the very slow writes to video memory as the weak spot of the P6 platform, with performance here being as low as 10% of an identically clocked Pentium system in benchmarks such as VIDSPEED. Methods to circumvent this included setting VESA drawing to system memory instead of video memory in games such as &quot;Quake&quot;, and later on utilities such as FASTVID emerged, which could double performance in certain games by enabling the write combining features of the CPU. Memory type range registers (MTRRs) are set automatically by Windows video drivers starting from 1997, and from there the improved cache/memory subsystem and FPU performance caused it to outclass the Pentium clock-for-clock in the emerging 3D games of the mid–to–late 1990s, particularly when using Windows NT 4.0. However, its lack of MMX implementation reduces performance in multimedia applications that made use of those instructions.

===Caching===
Likely Pentium Pro&#x27;s most noticeable addition was its on-package L2 cache, which ranged from 256 KB at introduction to 1 MB in 1997. At the time, manufacturing technology did not feasibly allow a large L2 cache to be integrated into the processor core. Intel instead placed the L2 die(s) separately in the package which still allowed it to run at the same clock speed as the CPU core. Additionally, unlike most motherboard-based cache schemes that shared the main system bus with the CPU, the Pentium Pro&#x27;s cache had its own back-side bus (called &quot;dual independent bus&quot; by Intel). Because of this, the CPU could read main memory and cache concurrently, greatly reducing a traditional bottleneck. The cache was also &quot;non-blocking&quot;, meaning that the processor could issue more than one cache request at a time (up to 4), reducing cache-miss penalties; an example of memory-level parallelism (MLP). These properties combined to produce an L2 cache that was immensely faster than the motherboard-based caches of older processors. This cache alone gave the CPU an advantage in input/output performance over older x86 CPUs. In multiprocessor configurations, Pentium Pro&#x27;s integrated cache skyrocketed performance in comparison to architectures which had each CPU sharing a central cache.

However, this far faster L2 cache did come with some complications. The Pentium Pro&#x27;s &quot;on-package cache&quot; arrangement was unique. The processor and the cache were on separate dies in the same package and connected closely by a full-speed bus. The two or three dies had to be bonded together early in the production process, before testing was possible. This meant that a single, tiny flaw in either die made it necessary to discard the entire assembly, which was one of the reasons for the Pentium Pro&#x27;s relatively low production yield and high cost. All versions of the chip were expensive, those with 1024 KB being particularly so, since it required two 512 KB cache dies as well as the processor die.

==Available models==
Pentium Pro clock speeds were 150, 166, 180 or 200 MHz with a 60 or 66 MHz external bus clock. A prototype 133 MHz Pentium Pro was developed in its earliest stages of development but was never released. Some users chose to overclock their Pentium Pro chips, with the 200 MHz version often being run at 233 MHz, the 180 MHz version often being run at 200 MHz, and the 150 MHz version often being run at 166 MHz. The chip was popular in symmetric multiprocessing configurations, with dual and quad SMP server and workstation setups being commonplace.

Intel skipped out on providing a mobile version of the original Pentium Pro due to power draw and heat concerns. At least one vendor sold a portable computer with a Pentium Pro (Imperial Computer&#x27;s 6200TLP).

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, the Pentium Pro is family 6, model 1, and its Intel Product code is 80521.

==Fabrication==
The process used to fabricate the Pentium Pro processor die and its separate cache memory die changed, leading to a combination of processes used in the same package:
* The 133 MHz Pentium Pro prototype processor die was fabricated in a 0.6 μm BiCMOS process.
* The 150 MHz Pentium Pro processor die was fabricated in a 0.50 μm BiCMOS process.
* The 166, 180, and 200 MHz Pentium Pro processor die was fabricated in a 0.35 μm BiCMOS process.
* The 256 KB L2 cache die was fabricated in a 0.50 μm BiCMOS process.
* The 512 and 1024 KB L2 cache die was fabricated in a 0.35 μm BiCMOS process.

==Packaging==
The Pentium Pro (up to 512 KB cache) is packaged in a ceramic multi-chip module (MCM). The MCM contains two underside cavities in which the microprocessor die and its companion cache die reside. The dies are bonded to a heat slug, whose exposed top helps the heat from the dies to be transferred more directly to cooling apparatus such as a heat sink. The dies are connected to the package using conventional wire bonding. The cavities are capped with a ceramic plate.

The Pentium Pro with 1 MB of cache uses a plastic MCM. Instead of two cavities, there is only one, in which the three dies reside, bonded to the package instead of a heat slug. The cavities are filled in with epoxy.

The MCM has 387 pins, of which approximately half are arranged in a pin grid array (PGA) and half in an interstitial pin grid array (IPGA). The packaging was designed for Socket 8.

==Upgrade paths==
In 1998, the 300/333 MHz Pentium II OverDrive processor for Socket 8 was released. Based on some of the technology used in the &quot;Deschutes&quot; Pentium II Xeon, it featured double L1 and 512 KB of full-speed L2 cache with MMX capabilities, and was produced by Intel as a drop-in upgrade option for owners of Pentium Pro systems. However, it only supported two-way glueless multiprocessing, not four-way or higher, which did not make it a usable upgrade for quad-processor systems. These specially packaged Pentium II OverDrive processors were also used to upgrade the ASCI Red supercomputer in 1999. This makes the ASCI Red supercomputer, the first computer to reach the one teraFLOPS performance mark with dual Pentium Pro processors in 1996, to now become the first computer overall to exceed the two teraFLOPS performance mark with the upgrade to dual Pentium II OverDrive processors in 1999. ASCI Red continued to use dual Pentium II OverDrive processors for the remainder of its lifespan before being decommissioned in 2006.

As Slot 1 motherboards became prevalent, several manufacturers released slotket (or slocket) adapters, such as the Tyan M2020, Asus C-P6S1, Tekram P6SL1, and the Abit KP6. These sockets allowed Pentium Pro processors to be used with Slot 1 motherboards. However, only a few number of chipsets supported these slotkets, and so did not see widespread use. The Intel 440FX chipset explicitly supported both Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors, however the Intel 440BX and later Slot 1 chipsets did not explicitly support the Pentium Pro. Slotkets eventually saw renewed popularity in the form of Socket 370 to Slot 1 adapters, when Intel introduced Socket 370 Celeron and Pentium III processors in the late 1990s. These form of slotkets allowed for lower costs for computer builders, especially with dual processor machines, and gave Slot 1 motherboards the ability to continue receiving CPU upgrades beyond the then-currently available Slot 1 CPUs.

== Bus and multiprocessor capabilities ==
The Pentium Pro used GTL+ signaling in its front-side bus. The Pentium Pro could be used by itself on up to four-way designs. Eight-way Pentium Pro computers were also built, but these used multiple buses.

The design of the Pentium Pro bus was influenced by Futurebus, the Intel iAPX 432 bus, and elements of the Intel i960 bus. Futurebus had been intended as an advanced bus to replace VMEbus used with the Motorola 68000 from the late 1970s, but it stagnated in standardization committee for more than a decade if you count all the twists and turns. Intel&#x27;s iAPX 432 initiative was also a commercial failure, but in the process they did learn how to build a split-transaction bus to support a cacheless multiprocessor system. The i960 had further developed the split-transaction iAPX 432 bus to include a cache coherency protocol, ending up with a feature set highly reminiscent of the original Futurebus ambitions.

The Pentium Pro was designed to include the 4-way SMP split-transaction cache-coherent bus as a mandatory feature of every chip produced. This also served to deny competition access to the socket to produce cloned processors.

While the Pentium Pro was not successful as a machine for the masses due to poor 16-bit support for Windows 95 and many other 16-bit and mixed 16/32-bit operating systems, it did see significant successes in the file server space due to its advanced, integrated bus design, introducing many advanced features that had formerly only been available in the pricey workstation segment into the commodity marketplace.

<text>Opteron is AMD&#x27;s x86 former server and workstation processor line, and was the first processor which supported the AMD64 instruction set architecture (known generically as x86-64). It was released on April 22, 2003, with the &quot;SledgeHammer&quot; core (K8) and was intended to compete in the server and workstation markets, particularly in the same segment as the Intel Xeon processor. Processors based on the AMD K10 microarchitecture (codenamed &quot;Barcelona&quot;) were announced on September 10, 2007, featuring a new quad-core configuration. The last released Opteron CPUs are the Piledriver-based Opteron 4300 and 6300 series processors, codenamed &quot;Seoul&quot; and &quot;Abu Dhabi&quot; respectively.

In January 2016, the first ARMv8-A based Opteron-branded SoC was released, though it is unclear what, if any, heritage this Opteron-branded product line shares with the original Opteron technology other than intended use in the server space.
==Technical description==

===Key capabilities===
Opteron combines two important capabilities in a single processor:
# native execution of legacy x86 32-bit applications without speed penalties
# native execution of x86-64 64-bit applications

The first capability is notable because at the time of Opteron&#x27;s introduction, the only other 64-bit architecture marketed with 32-bit x86 compatibility (Intel&#x27;s Itanium) ran x86 legacy-applications only with significant speed degradation. The second capability, by itself, is less noteworthy, as major RISC architectures (such as SPARC, Alpha, PA-RISC, PowerPC, MIPS) have been 64-bit for many years. In combining these two capabilities, however, the Opteron earned recognition for its ability to run the vast installed base of x86 applications economically, while simultaneously offering an upgrade path to 64-bit computing.

The Opteron processor possesses an integrated memory controller supporting DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM or DDR3 SDRAM (depending on processor generation). This both reduces the latency penalty for accessing the main RAM and eliminates the need for a separate northbridge chip.

===Multi-processor features===
In multi-processor systems (more than one Opteron on a single motherboard), the CPUs communicate using the Direct Connect Architecture over high-speed HyperTransport links. Each CPU can access the main memory of another processor, transparent to the programmer. The Opteron approach to multi-processing is not the same as standard symmetric multiprocessing; instead of having one bank of memory for all CPUs, each CPU has its own memory. Thus the Opteron is a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture. The Opteron CPU directly supports up to an 8-way configuration, which can be found in mid-level servers. Enterprise-level servers use additional (and expensive) routing chips to support more than 8 CPUs per box.

In a variety of computing benchmarks, the Opteron architecture has demonstrated better multi-processor scaling than the Intel Xeon which did not have a point to point system until QPI and integrated memory controllers with the Nehalem design. This is primarily because adding another Opteron processor increases memory bandwidth, while that is not always the case for Xeon systems, and the fact that the Opterons use a switched fabric, rather than a shared bus. In particular, the Opteron&#x27;s integrated memory controller allows the CPU to access local RAM very quickly. In contrast, multiprocessor Xeon system CPUs share only two common buses for both processor-processor and processor-memory communication. As the number of CPUs increases in a typical Xeon system, contention for the shared bus causes computing efficiency to drop. Intel migrated to a memory architecture similar to the Opteron&#x27;s for the Intel Core i7 family of processors and their Xeon derivatives.

===Multi-core Opterons===
In April 2005, AMD introduced its first multi-core Opterons. At the time, AMD&#x27;s use of the term multi-core in practice meant dual-core; each physical Opteron chip contained two processor cores. This effectively doubled the computing performance available to each motherboard processor socket. One socket could then deliver the performance of two processors, two sockets could deliver the performance of four processors, and so on. Because motherboard costs increase dramatically as the number of CPU sockets increase, multicore CPUs enable a multiprocessing system to be built at lower cost.

AMD&#x27;s model number scheme has changed somewhat in light of its new multicore lineup. At the time of its introduction, AMD&#x27;s fastest multicore Opteron was the model 875, with two cores running at 2.2 GHz each. AMD&#x27;s fastest single-core Opteron at this time was the model 252, with one core running at 2.6 GHz. For multithreaded applications, or many single threaded applications, the model 875 would be much faster than the model 252.

Second-generation Opterons are offered in three series: the 1000 Series (single socket only), the 2000 Series (dual socket-capable), and the 8000 Series (quad or octo socket-capable). The 1000 Series uses the AM2 socket. The 2000 Series and 8000 Series use Socket F.

AMD announced its third-generation quad-core Opteron chips on September 10, 2007 
with hardware vendors announcing servers in the following month. Based on a core design codenamed &quot;Barcelona&quot;, new power and thermal management techniques were planned for the chips. Earlier dual core DDR2 based platforms were upgradeable to quad core chips.
The fourth generation was announced in June 2009 with the &quot;Istanbul&quot; hexa-cores. It introduced &quot;HT Assist&quot;, an additional directory for data location, reducing the overhead for probing and broadcasts. HT Assist uses 1 MB L3 cache per CPU when activated.

In March 2010 AMD released the &quot;Magny-Cours&quot; Opteron 6100 series CPUs for Socket G34. These are 8- and 12-core multi-chip module CPUs consisting of two four or six-core dies with a HyperTransport 3.1 link connecting the two dies. These CPUs updated the multi-socket Opteron platform to use DDR3 memory and increased the maximum HyperTransport link speed from 2.40 GHz (4.80 GT/s) for the &quot;Istanbul&quot; CPUs to 3.20 GHz (6.40 GT/s).

AMD changed the naming scheme for its Opteron models. Opteron 4000 series CPUs on Socket C32 (released July 2010) are dual-socket capable and are targeted at uniprocessor and dual-processor uses. The Opteron 6000 series CPUs on Socket G34 are quad-socket capable and are targeted at high-end dual-processor and quad-processor applications.

=== CPU socket models ===

==== Socket 939 ====
AMD released Socket 939 Opterons, reducing the cost of motherboards for low-end servers and workstations. Except for the fact they have 1 MB L2 cache (versus 512 KB for the Athlon 64) the Socket 939 Opterons are identical to the San Diego and Toledo core Athlon 64s, but are run at lower clock speeds than the cores are capable of, making them more stable.

==== Socket AM2 ====
Socket AM2 Opterons are available for servers that only have a single-chip setup. Codenamed Santa Ana, rev. F dual core AM2 Opterons feature 2 × 1 MB L2 cache, unlike the majority of their Athlon 64 X2 cousins which feature 2 × 512 KB L2 cache. These CPUs are given model numbers ranging from 1210 to 1224.

==== Socket AM2+ ====
AMD introduced three quad-core Opterons on Socket AM2+ for single-CPU servers in 2007. These CPUs are produced on a 65 nm manufacturing process and are similar to the &quot;Agena&quot; Phenom X4 CPUs. The Socket AM2+ quad-core Opterons are code-named &quot;Budapest&quot;. The Socket AM2+ Opterons carry model numbers of 1352 (2.10 GHz), 1354 (2.20 GHz), and 1356 (2.30 GHz).

==== Socket AM3 ====
AMD introduced three quad-core Opterons on Socket AM3 for single-CPU servers in 2009. These CPUs are produced on a 45 nm manufacturing process and are similar to the &quot;Deneb&quot;-based Phenom II X4 CPUs. The Socket AM3 quad-core Opterons are code-named &quot;Suzuka&quot;. These CPUs carry model numbers of 1381 (2.50 GHz), 1385 (2.70 GHz), and 1389 (2.90 GHz).

==== Socket AM3+ ====
Socket AM3+ was introduced in 2011 and is a modification of AM3 for the Bulldozer microarchitecture. Opteron CPUs in the AM3+ package are named Opteron 3xxx.

==== Socket F ====
Socket F (LGA 1207 contacts) is AMD’s second generation of Opteron socket. This socket supports processors such as the Santa Rosa, Barcelona, Shanghai, and Istanbul codenamed processors. the &quot;lidded land grid array&quot; socket adds support for DDR2 SDRAM and improved HyperTransport version 3 connectivity. Physically the socket and processor package are nearly identical, although not generally compatible with socket 1207 FX.

==== Socket G34 ====
Socket G34 (LGA 1944 contacts) is one of the third generation of Opteron sockets, along with Socket C32. This socket supports &quot;Magny-Cours&quot; Opteron 6100, Bulldozer-based &quot;Interlagos&quot; Opteron 6200, and Piledriver-based &quot;Abu Dhabi&quot; Opteron 6300 series processors. This socket supports four channels of DDR3 SDRAM (two per CPU die). Unlike previous multi-CPU Opteron sockets, Socket G34 CPUs will function with unbuffered ECC or non-ECC RAM in addition to the traditional registered ECC RAM.

==== Socket C32 ====
Socket C32 (LGA 1207 contacts) is the other member of the third generation of Opteron sockets. This socket is physically similar to Socket F but is not compatible with Socket F CPUs. Socket C32 uses DDR3 SDRAM and is keyed differently so as to prevent the insertion of Socket F CPUs that can use only DDR2 SDRAM. Like Socket G34, Socket C32 CPUs will be able to use unbuffered ECC or non-ECC RAM in addition to registered ECC SDRAM.

===== Micro-architecture update =====
The Opteron line saw an update with the implementation of the AMD K10 microarchitecture. New processors, launched in the third quarter of 2007 (codename &quot;Barcelona&quot;), incorporate a variety of improvements, particularly in memory prefetching, speculative loads, SIMD execution and branch prediction, yielding an appreciable performance improvement over K8-based Opterons, within the same power envelope.

In 2007 AMD introduced a scheme to characterize the power consumption of new processors under &quot;average&quot; daily usage, named average CPU power (ACP).

==== Socket FT3 ====
The Opteron X1150 and Opteron X2150 APU are used with the BGA-769 or Socket FT3.

== Features ==
===APUs===
See 

==Models==
For Socket 940 and Socket 939 Opterons, each chip has a three-digit model number, in the form &quot;Opteron XYY. For Socket F and Socket AM2 Opterons, each chip has a four-digit model number, in the form &quot;Opteron XZYY. For all first, second, and third-generation Opterons, the first digit (the X) specifies the number of CPUs on the target machine:
* 1 – Designed for uniprocessor systems
* 2 – Designed for dual-processor systems
* 8 – Designed for systems with 4 or 8 processors
For Socket F and Socket AM2 Opterons, the second digit (the Z) represents the processor generation. Presently, only 2 (dual-core, DDR2), 3 (quad-core, DDR2) and 4 (six-core, DDR2) are used.

Socket C32 and G34 Opterons use a new four-digit numbering scheme. The first digit refers to the number of CPUs in the target machine:

*4 – Designed for uniprocessor and dual-processor systems.
*6 – Designed for dual-processor and four-processor systems.

Like the previous second and third generation Opterons, the second number refers to the processor generation. &quot;1&quot; refers to AMD K10-based units (&quot;Magny-Cours&quot; and &quot;Lisbon&quot;), &quot;2&quot; refers to the Bulldozer-based &quot;Interlagos&quot;, &quot;Valencia&quot;, and &quot;Zurich&quot;-based units, and &quot;3&quot; refers to the Piledriver-based &quot;Abu Dhabi&quot;, &quot;Seoul&quot;, and &quot;Delhi&quot;-based units.

For all Opterons, the last two digits in the model number (the YY) indicate the clock frequency of a CPU, a higher number indicating a higher clock frequency. This speed indication is comparable to processors of the same generation if they have the same amount of cores, single-cores and dual-cores have different indications despite sometimes having the same clock frequency.

The suffix HE or EE indicates a high-efficiency/energy-efficiency model having a lower TDP than a standard Opteron. The suffix SE indicates a top-of-the-line model having a higher TDP than a standard Opteron.

Starting from 65 nm fabrication process, the Opteron codenames have been based on Formula 1 hosting cities; AMD has a long term sponsorship with F1&#x27;s most successful team, Ferrari.

==Supercomputers==

Opteron processors first appeared in the top 100 systems of the fastest supercomputers in the world list in the early 2000s. By the summer of 2006, 21 of the top 100 systems used Opteron processors, and in the November 2010 and June 2011 lists the Opteron reached its maximum representation of 33 of the top 100 systems. The number of Opteron-based systems decreased fairly rapidly after this peak, falling to 3 of the top 100 systems by November 2016, and in November 2017 only one Opteron-based system remained.

Several supercomputers using only Opteron processors were ranked in the top 10 systems between 2003 and 2015, notably:

* Red Storm – Sandia National Laboratories – system in November 2006.
* Jaguar – Oak Ridge National Laboratory – various configurations held top 10 positions between 2005 and 2011, including in November 2009 and June 2010.
* Ranger – Texas Advanced Computing Center – system in June 2008.
* Kraken – National Institute for Computational Sciences – system in November 2009.
* Hopper – National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center – system in November 2010.

Other top 10 systems using a combination of Opteron processors and compute accelerators have included:

* IBM Roadrunner – Los Alamos National Laboratory – system in 2008. Composed of Opteron processors with IBM PowerXCell 8i co-processors.

The only system remaining on the list (as of November 2017), also using Opteron processors combined with compute accelerators:

* Titan (supercomputer) – Oak Ridge National Laboratory – system in 2012, as of November 2017. Composed of Opteron processors with Nvidia Fermi (microarchitecture) GPU-based accelerators.

==Issues==

===Opteron without Optimized Power Management===
AMD released some Opteron processors without Optimized Power Management (OPM) support, which use DDR memory. The following table describes those processors without OPM.

===Opteron recall (2006)===
AMD recalled some E4 stepping-revision single-core Opteron processors, including ×52 (2.6 GHz) and ×54 (2.8 GHz) models which use DDR memory. The following table describes affected processors, as listed in AMD Opteron ×52 and ×54 Production Notice of 2006.

The affected processors may produce inconsistent results if three specific conditions occur simultaneously:
* The execution of floating point-intensive code sequences
* Elevated processor temperatures
* Elevated ambient temperatures

A software verification tool for identifying the AMD Opteron processors listed in the above table that may be affected under these specific conditions is available, only to AMD OEM partners. AMD will replace those processors at no charge.

==Recognition==
In the February 2010 issue of &quot;Custom PC&quot; (a UK-based computing magazine focused on PC hardware), the AMD Opteron 144 (released in Summer 2005) appeared in the &quot;Hardware Hall of Fame&quot;. It was described as &quot;The best overclocker&#x27;s CPU ever made&quot; due to its low cost and ability to run at speeds far beyond its stock speed. (According to &quot;Custom PC&quot;, it could run at &quot;close to 3 GHz on air&quot;.)

<text>Aylesford is a village and civil parish on the River Medway in Kent, England, northwest of Maidstone.

Originally a small riverside settlement, the old village comprises around 60 houses, many of which were formerly shops. Two pubs, a village shop and other amenities are located on the high street. Aylesford&#x27;s current population is around 5,000.

The Parish of Aylesford covers more than , stretching north to Rochester Airport estate and south to Barming, and has a total population of over 10,000 (as of 2011), with the main settlements at Aylesford, Eccles, Blue Bell Hill and (part of) Walderslade.

Aylesford Newsprint was a major employer in the area and the largest paper recycling factory in Europe, manufacturing newsprint. It closed in 2015.

== History ==
There has been activity in the area since Neolithic times. There are several chamber tombs north of the village, of which Kit&#x27;s Coty House, to the north, is the most famous; all have been damaged by farming. Kit&#x27;s Coty is the remains of the burial chamber at one end of a long barrow. Just south of this, situated lower down the same hillside, is a similar structure, Little Kits Coty House (also known as the &quot;Countless Stones&quot;).
Bronze Age swords have been discovered near here and an Iron Age settlement and Roman villa stood at Eccles. A cemetery of the British Iron Age discovered in 1886 was excavated under the leadership of Sir Arthur Evans (of Knossos fame), and published in 1890. Many of Evans&#x27; finds are now kept in the British Museum, including a bronze jug, pan and &#x27;bucket&#x27; with handles in the form of a human face from a cremation burial. With the later excavation at Swarling not far away (discovery to publication was 1921–1925) this is the type site for Aylesford-Swarling pottery or the Aylesford-Swarling culture. Evans&#x27; conclusion that the site belonged to a culture closely related to the continental Belgae, remains the modern view, though the dating has been refined to the period after about 75 BC. The village has been suggested as the site of the Battle of the Medway during the Roman invasion of Britain although there is no direct evidence of this.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the Battle of Aylesford taking place nearby in 455, when the Germanic Hengest fought the Welsh Vortigern; Horsa (Hengist&#x27;s brother) is said to have fallen in this battle; Alfred the Great defeated the Danes in 893; as did Edmund II Ironside in 1016.

Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, the manor of Aylesford was owned by William the Conqueror. Some of the land was given to the Bishop of Rochester as compensation for land seized for the building of Rochester Castle. The Domesday Book of 1086 records: &quot;Also the Bishop of Rochester holds as much of this land as is worth 17s6d in exchange for the land on which the castle stands&quot;. 17s6d is the rental value (as used for taxation), not the capital value.

The church of St Peter and St Paul is of Norman origin. Here there is a memorial to the Culpeper family, who owned the nearby Preston Hall Estate.

=== The Friars ===
In 1240, Ralph Frisburn, on his return from the Holy Land, founded a Carmelite monastery under the patronage of Richard, Lord Grey of Codnor, among the first of the Order to be founded in Europe. He was followed later by Simon Stock, who in 1254 was elected Prior General of the now mendicant Carmelites. Saint Simon died in 1265, whilst on a visit to Bordeaux, whereafter, his remains were honoured for centuries. In July 1951, his relics (remains of his head) were installed in a reliquary at the friary.

Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII in 1536, ownership of the site was transferred in 1538 to Sir Thomas Wyatt of nearby Allington Castle. Following the rebellion against Queen Mary by Sir Thomas&#x27;s son, Thomas Wyatt the younger, the property was forfeited back to the crown. Possession was later granted to Sir John Sedley by Mary&#x27;s half-sister Queen Elizabeth. The Sedleys sold the estate to Sir Peter Ricaut and his family. Although the Sedley family made some changes to the priory, it was the next owner, Sir John Banks, in the 1670s, who was responsible for the remodelling of the buildings.
In 1696, the estate passed by marriage to Heneage Finch, later created Earl of Aylesford. 

The main part of the house was destroyed by fire in the 1930s, revealing many original features, which had been hidden by Banks&#x27;s alterations. The Carmelites purchased it in 1949 from the Hewitt family and restored some of the original buildings; beyond the cloisters four chapels have been built to service the needs of the many different groups that visit yearly (The Choir Chapel - where the community celebrates daily Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours; St Joseph&#x27;s; St Anne&#x27;s; and the Relic Chapel, which houses the remains of St Simon Stock). Aesthetically, the modern build shows sensitivity to the existing buildings with a mixture of English Gothic (perpendicular Gothic) and Tudor features; many modern materials have been employed but traditional peg tiles are on the roofs and the walls are faced in Kentish ragstone. The priory is a popular place for pilgrimage, as well as for retreats and conferences. The friary has some notable artwork, such as many pieces by the ceramic artist Adam Kossowski. The remains of the manor house present at the foundation of the priory are believed to lie under the Great Courtyard; this could date from as early as 1085.

== River Medway ==
Due to the village&#x27;s location on its banks, the River Medway has been a key influence on its development. Aylesford takes its name from an Old English personal name, and literally denotes &#x27;Ægel&#x27;s ford&#x27;. Its first recorded use is from the tenth century, as Æglesforda. It was also the place where one of the earliest bridges across the Medway was built, believed to be in the 14th century (although the wide central span seen today is later). Upstream from Rochester Bridge, it became the next bridging point. The river was navigable as far as Maidstone until 1740, when barges of forty tons could reach as far as Tonbridge. As a result, wharves were built, one being at Aylesford. Corn, fodder and fruit, along with stone and timber, were the principal cargoes. Due to increased road traffic in recent years, the ancient bridge has now been superseded by a modern structure nearby, but remains in use for pedestrians.

== The village ==

The oldest parts of the village lie north and immediately south of the Medway. Many of the buildings are of great antiquity: the Chequers Inn, the George House (formerly a coaching inn) and the almshouses among them. St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s church, parts of which date back to the Norman invasion, sits on a hill in the southern part of the village.
Major construction took place during the Victorian era, when houses were built to serve the nearby quarry. The brick and tile industries have been replaced by a large area of commercial buildings, and what was once the huge Aylesford paper mills site was later regenerated by a leading newsprint plant surrounded by newly developed private estates featuring high value accommodation.

Recent expansion has been to the southern side of the river, where a substantial suburban housing estate has grown up, partly because the village is served by the railway, with connections for Maidstone and London. Many of these homes were originally owned by employees of the paper mills, which are now closed and which have been replaced by a number of smaller industrial estates with a variety of specialist businesses that include engineering, manufacturing, wholesale and others.

=== Schools ===
Henry Arthur Brassey (1840–1891) was a great benefactor of Aylesford, and as well as financing major repairs to the church, also provided the village with a school. This was replaced in the 1960s with a new building to the south east of the village, next to the site of the local secondary school (now Aylesford School - Sports College) which was housed in buildings largely built in the 1940s by Italian prisoners of War. The old school buildings were totally rebuilt on the same site in 2008. The original village school – now known as the Brassey Centre – is used as a church office and community hall.

=== Railway ===
Aylesford railway station, opened on 18 June 1856, is on the Medway Valley Line connecting Strood with Maidstone (West) and Paddock Wood. The original station buildings – gabled and highly decorated, built in Kentish ragstone with Caen stone dressings, with windows that replicate those at Aylesford Priory – have been used as a fast food restaurant in recent years following restoration in the 1980s.

=== Royal British Legion Village ===
Located to the south of Aylesford, on the A20 London Road, the Royal British Legion Village was founded after the First World War to help injured soldiers following their discharge from the nearby Preston Hall hospital. It was first the centre of a small farming community known as The Preston Hall Colony. When the British Legion was founded in 1921, it became one of the first branches and, by 1925, was known as Royal British Legion Village. A thriving community has since developed, providing nursing homes, sheltered housing and independent living units, as well as employment and social activities, helping all disabled veterans living in, or moving to, the area. In 1972 the Poppy Appeal headquarters moved to the village, which now forms one of the main centres of Legion life and activities. An industrial complex in the village houses Royal British Legion industries, including the manufacture of road and public signs used throughout the UK.

=== Sports ===
Aylesford Football Club are based in the village, playing at the Recreation Ground on Forstal Road since before the War Aylesford Bulls Rugby Football Club is located at the Jack Williams Memorial Ground in Hall Road. They run children&#x27;s age-grade teams from U6-U18 plus several adult teams for men and women of all levels.

The village is home to what is claimed to be Britain&#x27;s oldest operating sauna, the Finnish Sauna Bath. Built for the London Olympics in 1948, it was subsequently moved to Aylesford.

<text>Pierre de Ronsard (; 11 September 1524 – 27 December 1585) was a French poet known in his generation as a &quot;prince of poets&quot;. His works include &quot;Les Amours de Cassandre&quot; (1552)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Les Hymnes&quot; (1555-1556)&quot;, Les Discours&quot; (1562-1563), &quot;La Franciade&quot; (1572)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Sonnets pour Hélène&quot; (1578)&quot;.&quot;

Ronsard was born at Manoir de la Possonnière in the village of Couture-sur-Loir, Vendômois. His father served Francis I as &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel du roi&quot;. Ronsard received an education at home before attending the College of Navarre in Paris at age nine. He later travelled extensively, including visits to Scotland, Flanders, and Holland. After a hearing impairment halted his diplomatic career, Ronsard dedicated himself to study at the Collège Coqueret. He later became the acknowledged leader of La Pléiade, a group of seven French Renaissance poets.

His works were both admired and criticized throughout his life, and his reputation was established by critics such as Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve. His poetry is characterized by its peculiar use of language and imagery, and a great variety of metre.

==Early life==
Pierre de Ronsard was born at the Manoir de la Possonnière, in the village of Couture-sur-Loir, Vendômois (in present-day Loir-et-Cher). Baudouin de Ronsard or Rossart was the founder of the French branch of the house, and made his mark in the early stages of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The poet&#x27;s father was Louis de Ronsard, and his mother was Jeanne de Chaudrier, who came from a noble and well-connected family. Pierre was the youngest son. Louis de Ronsard was &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel du roi&quot; to Francis I, whose captivity after Pavia had just been ameliorated by treaty, and who had to leave home shortly after Pierre&#x27;s birth.

The future poet was educated at home in his earliest years and sent to the Collège de Navarre in Paris at age nine. When Madeleine of France married to James V of Scotland, Ronsard became a page in the Scottish court, where he became inspired to render French vernacular translations of classical authors. A year after the death of the queen, he returned to France, travelling back through England.

Further travel took him to Flanders, Holland, and again, for a short time, Scotland, on diplomatic missions on with Claude d&#x27;Humières, seigneur de Lassigny. He then became secretary to the suite of Lazare de Baïf, the father of his future colleague in the Pléiade and his companion on this occasion, Antoine de Baïf, at the diet of Speyer. Afterwards he joined the entourage of the cardinal du Bellay-Langey; his notorious quarrel with François Rabelais dates from this period.

==Studies==

His apparently promising diplomatic career was cut short by an attack of deafness following a 1540 visit, as part of legation to Alsace, that no physician could cure; he would subsequently determine to devote himself to study. The institution he chose for the purpose among the numerous schools and colleges of Paris was the Collège Coqueret, the principal of which was Jean Daurat — afterwards the &quot;dark star&quot; (as he has been called from his silence in French) of the Pléiade, and already an acquaintance of Ronsard&#x27;s from having held the office of tutor in the Baïf household. Antoine de Baïf, Daurat&#x27;s pupil, accompanied Ronsard; Remy Belleau shortly followed; Joachim du Bellay, the second of the seven, joined not much later. Muretus (Marc Antoine de Muret), a great scholar and by means of his Latin plays a great influence in the creation of French tragedy, was also a student here.

Ronsard&#x27;s period of study occupied seven years, and the first manifesto of the new literary movement, which was to apply to the vernacular the principles of criticism and scholarship learnt from the classics, came not from him but from Du Bellay. The &quot;Défense et illustration de la langue française&quot; of the latter appeared in 1549, and the Pléiade (or Brigade, as it was first called) may be said to have been then launched. It consisted, as its name implies, of seven writers whose names are sometimes differently enumerated, though the orthodox canon is beyond doubt composed of Ronsard, Du Bellay, Baïf, Belleau, Pontus de Tyard (a man of rank and position who had exemplified the principles of the friends earlier), Jodelle the dramatist, and Daurat. Ronsard&#x27;s own work came a little later, and a rather idle story is told of a trick of Du Bellay&#x27;s which at last determined him to publish. Some single and minor pieces, an epithalamium on Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne de Navarre (1550), a &quot;&quot;Hymne de la France&quot; (1549), an &quot;Ode a la Paix&quot;,&quot; preceded the publication in 1550 of the four first books (&quot;first&quot; is characteristic and noteworthy) of the &quot;Odes of Pierre de Ronsard&quot;.

This was followed in 1552 by the publication of his &quot;Amours de Cassandre&quot; with the fifth book of Odes, dedicated to the 15-year-old Cassandre Salviati, whom he had met at Blois and followed to her father&#x27;s Château de Talcy. These books excited a violent literary quarrel. Marot was dead, but he left numerous followers, some of whom saw in the stricter literary critique of the Pléiade, in its outspoken contempt of merely vernacular and medieval forms, in its strenuous advice to French poetry to &quot;follow the ancients,&quot; and so forth, an insult to the author of the &quot;Adolescence Clémentine&quot; and his school.

==Fame==
His popularity in his own time was overwhelming and immediate, and his prosperity was unbroken. He published his &quot;Hymns&quot;, dedicated to Margaret de Valois, in 1555; the conclusion of the &quot;Amours&quot;, addressed to another heroine, in 1556; and then a collection of &quot;Œuvres completes&quot;, said to be due to the invitation of Mary Stuart, Queen of Francis II, in 1560; with &quot;Elégies, mascarades et bergeries&quot; in 1565. To this same year belongs his most important and interesting &quot;Abrégé de l&#x27;art poétique français&quot;.

The rapid change of sovereigns did Ronsard no harm. Charles IX, King of France, who succeeded his brother after a very short time, was even better inclined to him than Henry and Francis. He gave him rooms in the palace; he bestowed upon him diverse abbacies and priories; and he called him and regarded him constantly as his master in poetry. Neither was Charles IX a bad poet. This royal patronage, however, had its disagreeable side. It excited violent dislike to Ronsard on the part of the Huguenots, who wrote constant pasquinades against him, strove (by a ridiculous exaggeration of the Dionysiac festival at Arcueil, in which the friends had indulged to celebrate the success of the first French tragedy, Jodelle&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatre&quot;) to represent him as a libertine and an atheist, and (which seems to have annoyed him more than anything else) set up his follower Du Bartas as his rival.

According to some words of his own, they were not contented with this variety of argument, but attempted to have him assassinated. During this period, Ronsard began writing the epic poem the &quot;Franciade&quot; (1572), a work that was never finished and is generally considered a failure due to its versification—a decasyllabic metre of &quot;rimes plates&quot; that corresponds poorly with the genre of epic poetry. The metre (the decasyllable) could not but contrast unfavourably with the magnificent alexandrines that Du Bartas and Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné were shortly to produce; the general plan is feebly classical, and the very language has little or nothing of that racy mixture of scholarliness and love of natural beauty which distinguishes the best work of the Pléiade. The poem could never have had an abiding success, but at its appearance it had the singular bad luck almost to coincide with the massacre of St Bartholomew, which had occurred about a fortnight before its publication. One party in the state were certain to look coldly on the work of a minion of the court at such a juncture, the other had something else to think of.

The death of Charles made little difference in the court favour which Ronsard enjoyed, but, combined with his increasing infirmities, it seems to have determined him to quit court life. During his last days he lived chiefly at a house which he possessed in Vendôme, the capital of his native province, at his abbey at Croix-Val in the same neighbourhood, or else at Paris, where he was usually the guest of Jean Galland, well known as a scholar, at the College de Boncourt. It seems also that he had a town house of his own in the Fauhourg Saint-Marcel. At any rate his preferments made him in perfectly easy circumstances, and he seems neither to have derived nor wished for any profit from his books. A half-jocular suggestion that his publishers should give him money to buy &quot;&quot;du bois pour se chauffer&quot; in return for his last revision of his &quot;Œuvres complètes&quot; is the only trace of any desire of the kind. On the other hand, he received not merely gifts and endowments from his own sovereign but presents from many others, including Elizabeth I of England. Mary, Queen of Scots addressed him from her prison, and Tasso consulted him on the &quot;Gerusalemme&quot;.

==Final years==
His last years were saddened not merely by the death of many of his closest friends, but by increasing ill health. This did not interfere with the quality of his literary work; he was rarely idle, and some of his final verse is among his best. But he indulged the temptation to alter his work repeatedly, and many of his later alterations are not improvements. Towards the end of 1585 his health deteriorated, and he seems to have moved restlessly from one of his houses to another for some months. When the end came—which, though in great pain, he met in a resolute and religious manner—he was at his priory of Saint-Cosme in Touraine, and he was buried in the church of that name on Friday, 27 December 1585.

==Works==
The character and fortunes of Ronsard&#x27;s works are among the most remarkable in literary history, and supply in themselves a kind of illustration of the progress of French literature during the last three centuries. It was long his fortune to be almost always extravagantly admired or violently attacked. At first, as has been said, the enmity, not altogether unprovoked, of the friends and followers of Marot fell to his lot, then the still fiercer antagonism of the Huguenot faction, who, happening to possess a poet of great merit in Du Bartas, were able to attack Ronsard at his tenderest point. But fate had by no means done its worst with him in his lifetime. After his death the classical reaction set in under the auspices of Malherbe, who seems to have been animated with a sort of personal hatred of Ronsard, though it is not clear that they ever met. After Malherbe, the rising glory of Corneille and his contemporaries obscured the tentative and unequal work of the Pléiade, which was, moreover, directly attacked by Boileau himself, the dictator of French criticism in the last half of the 17th century.

Then Ronsard was, except by a few men of taste, such as Jean de La Bruyère and Fénelon, forgotten when he was not sneered at. In this condition he remained during the whole 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th. The Romantic revival, seeing in him a victim of its special &quot;bête noire&quot; Boileau, and attracted by his splendid diction, rich metrical faculty, and combination of classical and medieval peculiarities, adopted his name as a kind of battle-cry, and for the moment exaggerated his merits somewhat. The critical work of Sainte-Beuve in his &quot;Tableau de la littérature française au 16ème siècle&quot;, and later of other authors, has established Ronsard&#x27;s reputation.

Ronsard was the acknowledged chief of the &quot;Pléiade&quot; and its most voluminous poet. He was probably also its best, though a few isolated pieces of Belleau excel him in airy lightness of touch. Several sonnets of Du Bellay exhibit the melancholy of the Renaissance more perfectly than anything of his, and the finest passages of the &quot;Tragiques&quot; and the &quot;Divine Sep&#x27;Maine&quot; surpass his work in command of the alexandrine and in power of turning it to the purposes of satirical invective and descriptive narration. But that work is very extensive (we possess at a rough guess not much short of a hundred thousand lines of his), and it is extraordinarily varied in form. He did not introduce the sonnet into France, but he practised it soon after its introduction and with skill - the famous &quot;Quand vous serez bien vieille&quot;&quot; being one of the acknowledged gems of French literature.
His many odes are interesting, and at best are fine compositions. He began by imitating the strophic arrangement of the ancients, but very soon had the wisdom to desert this for a kind of adjustment of the Horatian ode to rhyme, instead of exact quantitative metre. In this latter kind he devised some exquisitely melodious rhythms of which, till our own day, the secret died with the 17th century. His more sustained work sometimes displays a bad selection of measure; and his occasional poetry—epistles, eclogues, elegies, etc.--is injured by its vast volume. But the preface to the &quot;Franciade&quot; is a fine piece of verse, superior (it is in alexandrines) to the poem itself. In general, Ronsard is best in his amatory verse (the long series of sonnets and odes to Cassandre, Pikles, Marie, Genévre, Héléne—Héléne de Surgeres, a later and mainly &quot;literary&quot; love—etc.), and in his descriptions of the country (the famous &quot;&quot;Ode à Cassandre&quot;,&quot; the &quot;&quot;Fontaine Bellerie&quot;,&quot; the &quot;&quot;Forêt de Gastine&quot;,&quot; and so forth), which are graceful and fresh. He used the graceful diminutives which his school set in fashion. He knew well too how to manage the gorgeous adjectives (&quot;&quot;marbrine&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;cinabrine&quot;,&quot; &quot;ivoirine&quot; and the like) which were another fancy of the Pléiade. In short, Ronsard shows eminently the two great attractions of French 16th-century poetry as compared with that of the two following ages - magnificence of language and imagery and graceful variety of metre.

==Bibliography==
The chief separately published works of Ronsard are noted above. However, during his life he produced a vast number of separate publications, some of them mere pamphlets or broadsheets, which from time to time he collected, often striking out others at the same time, in the successive editions of his works. Of these he himself published seven - the first in 1560, the last in 1584. Between his death and the year 1630 ten more complete editions were published, the most famous of which is the folio of 1609. A copy of this presented by Sainte-Beuve to Victor Hugo, and later in the possession of Maxime du Camp, has a place of its own in French literary history. The work of Claude Binet in 1586, &quot;Discours de la vie de Pierre de Ronsard&quot;, is very important for early information, and the author seems to have revised some of Ronsard&#x27;s work under the poet&#x27;s own direction.

From 1630 Ronsard was not again reprinted for more than two centuries. Yet just before the close of the second Sainte-Beuve printed a selection of his poems to accompany the above-mentioned Tableau (1828). There are also selections, &quot;Choix de poésies - publiées par A. Noël&quot; (in the &quot;Collection Didot&quot;) and Becq de Fouquières. In 1857 Prosper Blanchemain, who had previously published a volume of &quot;Œuvres inédites de Ronsard&quot;, undertook a complete edition for the &quot;Bibliothèque Elzévirienne&quot;, in eight volumes. It is practically complete; a few pieces of a somewhat free character which are ascribed with some certainty to the poet are, however, excluded. A later and better edition still is that of Marty-Laveaux (1887–1893), and another that of Benjamin Pifteau (1891).

<text>Mellin de Saint-Gelais (or &quot;Melin de Saint-Gelays&quot; or &quot;Sainct-Gelais&quot;; c. 1491 – October, 1558) was a French poet of the Renaissance and Poet Laureate of Francis I of France.

== Life ==
He was born at Angoulême, most likely the natural son of Jean de Saint-Gelais, marquis de Montlieu, a member of the Angoumois gentry. His forename was the French-Norman malapropism of the British wizard Merlin featured in Arthurian legends. He was close to his uncle Octavien de Saint-Gelais (1466–1502), bishop of Angoulême since 1494, himself a poet who had translated the &quot;Aeneid&quot; into French.

Mellin, who had studied at Bologna and Padua, had the reputation of being doctor, astrologer and musician as well as poet. He returned to France around 1523, and soon gained favour at the court of the art-loving Valois ruler Francis I by his skill in light verse. He was made almoner to the Dauphin, abbot of Reclus in the diocese of Troyes and librarian to the king at Blois.

He enjoyed immense popularity until the appearance of Joachim du Bellay&#x27;s &quot;Défense et illustration...&quot; in 1549, where Saint-Gelais was not excepted from the scorn poured on contemporary poets. He attempted to ridicule the innovators by reading aloud the &quot;Odes&quot; of Pierre de Ronsard with burlesque emphasis before Henry II, when the king&#x27;s sister, Marguerite de Valois, seized the book and read them herself.

Ronsard accepted Saint-Gelais&#x27;s apology for this incident, but Du Bellay satirized the offender in the &quot;Poète courtisan&quot;. He translated the &quot;Sofonisba&quot; of Gian Giorgio Trissino (1478–1550) which was represented in 1556 before Catherine de&#x27; Medici at Blois. Saint-Gelais was the champion of the &quot;style marotique&quot; (see Clément Marot) and the earliest of French sonneteers and petrarchist. He died in Paris in 1558.

<doc id="165252" wikidata="Q25403" url="?curid=165252" title="Beech">
<text>Beech (genus Fagus) is a genus of deciduous trees in the family Fagaceae, native to subtropical (accessory forest element) and temperate (as dominant element of mesophytic forests) Eurasia and North America. There are 14 accepted species in two distinct subgenera, &quot;Englerianae&quot; and &quot;Fagus&quot;. The subgenus &quot;Englerianae&quot; is found only in East Asia, distinctive for its low branches, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. The better known species of subgenus &quot;Fagus&quot; are native to Europe, western and eastern Asia and eastern North America. They are high-branching trees with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark.

The European beech &quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; is the most commonly cultivated species, yielding a utility timber used for furniture construction, flooring and engineering purposes, in plywood, and household items. The timber can be used to build homes. Beechwood makes excellent firewood. Slats of washed beech wood are spread around the bottom of fermentation tanks for Budweiser beer. Beech logs are burned to dry the malt used in some German smoked beers. Beech is also used to smoke Westphalian ham, andouille sausage, and some cheeses.

== Description ==
Beeches are monoecious, bearing both male and female flowers on the same plant. The small flowers are unisexual, the female flowers borne in pairs, the male flowers wind-pollinating catkins. They are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. The fruit of the beech tree, known as beechnuts or mast, is found in small burrs that drop from the tree in autumn. They are small, roughly triangular, and edible, with a bitter, astringent, or mild and nut-like taste.

The European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;) is the most commonly cultivated, although few important differences are seen between species aside from detail elements such as leaf shape. The leaves of beech trees are entire or sparsely toothed, from long and broad.

The bark is smooth and light gray. The fruit is a small, sharply three-angled nut long, borne singly or in pairs in soft-spined husks long, known as cupules. The husk can have a variety of spine- to scale-like appendages, the character of which is, in addition to leaf shape, one of the primary ways beeches are differentiated. The nuts are called beechnuts or beech mast and have a bitter taste (though not nearly as bitter as acorns) and a high tannin content.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The most recent classification system of the genus recognizes 14 species in two distinct subgenera, subgenus &quot;Englerianae&quot; and &quot;Fagus&quot;. Beech species can be diagnosed by phenotypical and/or genotypical traits. Species of subgenus &quot;Engleriana&quot; are found only in East Asia, and are notably distinct from species of subgenus &quot;Fagus&quot; in that these beeches are low-branching trees, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark and a substantially different nucleome (nuclear DNA), especially in noncoding, highly variable gene regions such as the spacers of the nuclear-encoded ribosomal RNA genes (ribosomal DNA). Further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves, the visible tertiary leaf veins, and a long, smooth cupule-peduncle. Originally proposed but not formalized by botanist Chung-Fu Shen in 1992, this group comprised two Japanese species, &quot;F. japonica&quot; and &quot;F. okamotoi,&quot; and one Chinese species, &quot;F. engleriana&quot;. While the status of &quot;F. okamotoi&quot; remains uncertain, the most recent systematic treatment based on morphological and genetic data confirmed a third species, &quot;F. multinervis,&quot; endemic to Ulleungdo, a South Korean island in the Sea of Japan. The beeches of Ulleungdo have been traditionally treated as a subspecies of &quot;F. engleriana,&quot; to which they are phenotypically identical, or as a variety of &quot;F. japonica.&quot; The differ from their siblings by their unique nuclear and plastid genotypes.

The better known subgenus &quot;Fagus&quot; beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-gray bark. This group includes five extant species in continental and insular East Asia (&quot;F. crenata, F. longipetiolata, F. lucida&quot;, and the cryptic sister species &quot;F. hayatae&quot; and &quot;F. pashanica&quot;)&quot;,&quot; two pseudo-cryptic species in eastern North America (&quot;F. grandifolia&quot;&quot;, F. mexicana&quot;), and a species complex of at least four species (&quot;F. caspica, F. hohenackeriana, F. orientalis, F. sylvatica&quot;) in Western Eurasia. Their genetics are highly complex and include both species-unique alleles as well as alleles and ribosomal DNA spacers that are shared between two or more species. The western Eurasian species are characterized by morphological and genetical gradients.

Research suggests that the first representatives of the modern-day genus were already present in the Paleocene of Arctic North America (western Greenland) and quickly radiated across the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, with a first diversity peak in the Miocene of northeastern Asia. The contemporary species are the product of past, repeated reticulate evolutionary processes (outbreeding, introgression, hybridization). As far as studied, heterozygosity and intragenomic variation are common in beech species, and their chloroplast genomes are nonspecific with the exception of the Western Eurasian and North American species.

&quot;Fagus&quot; is the first diverging lineage in the evolution of the Fagaceae family, which also includes oaks and chestnuts. The oldest fossils that can be assigned to the beech lineage are 81–82 million years old pollen from the Late Cretaceous of Wyoming, United States. The southern beeches (genus &quot;Nothofagus&quot;) historically thought closely related to beeches, are treated as members of a separate family, the Nothofagaceae (which remains a member of the order Fagales). They are found throughout the Southern Hemisphere in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, New Caledonia, as well as Argentina and Chile (principally Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego).

=== Etymology ===
The name of the tree in Latin, &quot;fagus&quot; (from whence the generic epithet), is cognate with English &quot;beech&quot; and of Indo-European origin, and played an important role in early debates on the geographical origins of the Indo-European people, the beech argument. Greek φηγός (figós) is from the same root, but the word was transferred to the oak tree (e.g. Iliad 16.767) as a result of the absence of beech trees in southern Greece.

== Distribution and habitat ==

=== Britain and Ireland ===
&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; was a late entrant to Great Britain after the last glaciation, and may have been restricted to basic soils in the south of England. Some suggest that it was introduced by Neolithic tribes who planted the trees for their edible nuts. The beech is classified as a native in the south of England and as a non-native in the north where it is often removed from &#x27;native&#x27; woods. Large areas of the Chilterns are covered with beech woods, which are habitat to the common bluebell and other flora. The Cwm Clydach National Nature Reserve in southeast Wales was designated for its beech woodlands, which are believed to be on the western edge of their natural range in this steep limestone gorge.

Beech is not native to Ireland; however, it was widely planted in the 18th century and can become a problem shading out the native woodland understory.

Beech is widely planted for hedging and in deciduous woodlands, and mature, regenerating stands occur throughout mainland Britain at elevations below about . The tallest and longest hedge in the world (according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;) is the Meikleour Beech Hedge in Meikleour, Perth and Kinross, Scotland.

=== Continental Europe ===
&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; is one of the most common hardwood trees in north-central Europe, in France constituting alone about 15% of all nonconifers. The Balkans are also home to the lesser-known oriental beech (&quot;F. orientalis&quot;) and Crimean beech (&quot;F. taurica&quot;).

As a naturally growing forest tree, beech marks the important border between the European deciduous forest zone and the northern pine forest zone. This border is important for wildlife and fauna.

In Denmark and Scania at the southernmost peak of the Scandinavian peninsula, southwest of the natural spruce boundary, it is the most common forest tree. It grows naturally in Denmark and southern Norway and Sweden up to about 57–59°N. The most northern known naturally growing (not planted) beech trees are found in a small grove north of Bergen on the west coast of Norway. Near the city of Larvik is the largest naturally occurring beech forest in Norway, Bøkeskogen.

Some research suggests that early agriculture patterns supported the spread of beech in continental Europe. Research has linked the establishment of beech stands in Scandinavia and Germany with cultivation and fire disturbance, i.e. early agricultural practices. Other areas which have a long history of cultivation, Bulgaria for example, do not exhibit this pattern, so how much human activity has influenced the spread of beech trees is as yet unclear.

The primeval beech forests of the Carpathians are also an example of a singular, complete, and comprehensive forest dominated by a single tree species - the beech tree. Forest dynamics here were allowed to proceed without interruption or interference since the last ice age. Nowadays, they are amongst the last pure beech forests in Europe to document the undisturbed postglacial repopulation of the species, which also includes the unbroken existence of typical animals and plants. These virgin beech forests and similar forests across 12 countries in continental Europe were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2007.

=== North America ===
The American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;) occurs across much of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada, with a disjunct sister species in Mexico (&quot;F. mexicana&quot;). It is the only extant (surviving) &quot;Fagus&quot; species in the Western Hemisphere. Before the Pleistocene Ice Age, it is believed to have spanned the entire width of the continent from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific but now is confined to the east of the Great Plains. &quot;F. grandifolia&quot; tolerates hotter climates than European species but is not planted much as an ornamental due to slower growth and less resistance to urban pollution. It most commonly occurs as an overstory component in the northern part of its range with sugar maple, transitioning to other forest types further south such as beech-magnolia. American beech is rarely encountered in developed areas except as a remnant of a forest that was cut down for land development.

The dead brown leaves of the American beech remain on the branches until well into the following spring, when the new buds finally push them off.

=== Asia ===
East Asia is home to eight species of &quot;Fagus&quot;, only one of which (&quot;F. crenata&quot;) is occasionally planted in Western countries. Smaller than &quot;F. sylvatica&quot; and &quot;F. grandifolia&quot;, this beech is one of the most common hardwoods in its native range.

== Ecology ==
Beech grows on a wide range of soil types, acidic or basic, provided they are not waterlogged. The tree canopy casts dense shade and thickens the ground with leaf litter.

In North America, they can form beech-maple climax forests by partnering with the sugar maple.

The beech blight aphid (&quot;Grylloprociphilus imbricator&quot;) is a common pest of American beech trees. Beeches are also used as food plants by some species of Lepidoptera.

Beech bark is extremely thin and scars easily. Since the beech tree has such delicate bark, carvings, such as lovers&#x27; initials and other forms of graffiti, remain because the tree is unable to heal itself.

=== Diseases ===

Beech bark disease is a fungal infection that attacks the American beech through damage caused by scale insects. Infection can lead to the death of the tree.

Beech leaf disease is a disease that affects American beeches spread by the newly discovered nematode, &quot;Litylenchus crenatae mccannii&quot;. This disease was first discovered in Lake County, Ohio, in 2012 and has now spread to over 41 counties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Ontario, Canada.
As of 2024, the disease has become widespread in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and in portions of coastal New Hampshire and coastal and central Maine.

== Cultivation ==
The beech most commonly grown as an ornamental tree is the European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), widely cultivated in North America as well as its native Europe. Many varieties are in cultivation, notably the weeping beech &quot;F. sylvatica&quot; &#x27;Pendula&#x27;, several varieties of copper or purple beech, the fern-leaved beech &quot;F. sylvatica&quot; &#x27;Asplenifolia&#x27;, and the tricolour beech &quot;F. sylvatica&quot; &#x27;Roseomarginata&#x27;. The columnar Dawyck beech (&quot;F. sylvatica&quot; &#x27;Dawyck&#x27;) occurs in green, gold, and purple forms, named after Dawyck Botanic Garden in the Scottish Borders, one of the four garden sites of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.

== Uses ==
===Wood===
Beech wood is an excellent firewood, easily split and burning for many hours with bright but calm flames. Slats of beech wood are washed in caustic soda to leach out any flavour or aroma characteristics and are spread around the bottom of fermentation tanks for Budweiser beer. This provides a complex surface on which the yeast can settle, so that it does not pile up, preventing yeast autolysis which would contribute off-flavours to the beer. Beech logs are burned to dry the malt used in German smoked beers. Beech is also used to smoke Westphalian ham, traditional andouille (an offal sausage) from Normandy, and some cheeses.

Some drums are made from beech, which has a tone between those of maple and birch, the two most popular drum woods.

The textile modal is a kind of rayon often made wholly from reconstituted cellulose of pulped beech wood.

The European species &quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; yields a tough, utility timber. It weighs about 720 kg per cubic metre and is widely used for furniture construction, flooring, and engineering purposes, in plywood and household items, but rarely as a decorative wood. The timber can be used to build chalets, houses, and log cabins.

Beech wood is used for the stocks of military rifles when traditionally preferred woods such as walnut are scarce or unavailable or as a lower-cost alternative.

===Food===
The edible fruit of the beech tree, known as beechnuts or mast, is found in small burrs that drop from the tree in autumn. They are small, roughly triangular, and edible, with a bitter, astringent, or in some cases, mild and nut-like taste. According to the Roman statesman Pliny the Elder in his work &quot;Natural History&quot;, beechnut was eaten by the people of Chios when the town was besieged, writing of the fruit: &quot;that of the beech is the sweetest of all; so much so, that, according to Cornelius Alexander, the people of the city of Chios, when besieged, supported themselves wholly on mast&quot;. They can also be roasted and pulverized into an adequate coffee substitute. The leaves can be steeped in liquor to give a light green/yellow liqueur.

===Books===

In antiquity, the bark of the beech tree was used by Indo-European people for writing-related purposes, especially in a religious context. Beech wood tablets were a common writing material in Germanic societies before the development of paper. The Old English &quot;bōc&quot; has the primary sense of &quot;beech&quot; but also a secondary sense of &quot;book&quot;, and it is from &quot;bōc&quot; that the modern word derives. In modern German, the word for &quot;book&quot; is &quot;Buch,&quot; with &quot;Buche&quot; meaning &quot;beech tree&quot;. In modern Dutch, the word for &quot;book&quot; is &quot;boek,&quot; with &quot;beuk&quot; meaning &quot;beech tree&quot;. In Swedish, these words are the same, &quot;bok&quot; meaning both &quot;beech tree&quot; and &quot;book&quot;. There is a similar relationship in some Slavic languages. In Russian and Bulgarian, the word for beech is бук (&quot;buk&quot;), while that for &quot;letter&quot; (as in a letter of the alphabet) is буква (&quot;bukva&quot;), while Serbo-Croatian and Slovene use &quot;bukva&quot; to refer to the tree.

===Other===
The pigment bistre was made from beech wood soot. Beech litter raking as a replacement for straw in animal husbandry was an old non-timber practice in forest management that once occurred in parts of Switzerland in the 17th century. Beech has been listed as one of the 38 plants whose flowers are used to prepare Bach flower remedies.

<text>The history of Cologne covers over 2000 years of urban history. In the year 50, Cologne was elevated to a city under Roman law and named &quot;Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium&quot;; since the Frankish rule it is known by derivatives of simply &quot;Colonia&quot;, including German (later ) and French (borrowed into English) &quot;Cologne&quot;. The city became an influential merchant stronghold in the early Middle Ages due to its location on the Rhine, which allowed the most seasoned Cologne wholesalers to control the flow of goods from northern Italy to England. The archbishops promoted the perception of &quot;Holy Cologne&quot; when they developed the city to the capital of their Electorate of Cologne; to this end, they had both the semicircular city wall and the Gothic Cologne Cathedral built as a demonstration of power.
In the 15th century, Cologne was able to shake off archiepiscopal rule and, as a Free Imperial City, enabled the burgher ruling class to achieve great splendor, visibly documented by the Cologne School of Painting. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, however, the city&#x27;s development stalled. Only after French occupation when in 1815, Cologne was incorporated into Prussia, the city experienced a steady upswing borne by industrialization. In 1880, the cathedral was completed as a national monument of German imperial unity providing the city with its well-known landmark. Extensive devastation in the Second World War was followed by decades of reconstruction, which only slowly restored Cologne to its emblematic urban panorama on the Rhine through the efforts of urban repair. Today with more than one million inhabitants, Cologne is the fourth largest city in Germany. It is primarily marketed as an event city, with Cologne Carnival being perceived as the biggest tourist attraction.

== Demographic history of Cologne ==

In the time of Roman Late antiquity, the cultural development in northwestern Europe west of the Rhine was embodied by a network of urban settlements. Most important towns in the Rhineland were Trier, which served as imperial residence of the Western Roman Emperor from 293 to 395, and Cologne, where five Roman trunk roads intersected with the Rhine, also then used as a water transport route. When the Franks formed their kingdoms after the decline of Roman power, the Roman induced urban settlements in the Rhineland largely perished. Only a few places — such as Trier, Cologne and Mainz — remained continuously inhabited within the Roman urban scope, however with a significantly reduced population. Cologne, which had been inhabited by up to 20,000 people in Roman Late Antiquity, counted in the year 700 about 3,000 settlers and was thus after Trier (5,000) the second largest town in the Rhineland. Further west, the urban tradition survived in more numerous places, none of them having gathered significantly more inhabitants. This applies, among others, to Tours, Rouen, Reims (5,000 each) and Paris (3,000). The largest cities in Western Europe were Rome (44,000) and Milan (21,000).

In the following centuries, dynamic growth of Cologne was driven by enhanced merchant activities on river Rhine; in addition, the town became seat of an influential archbishop. In the year 1000, the city with 10,000 inhabitants was among the three largest cities in northwestern Europe, after Paris (15,000) and Rouen (12,000). From 1000 to 1200, Cologne experienced further steep growth and quadrupled its population to 40,000. This expansion was mirrored by an intensified church building in romanesque style known as the &quot;great century of Cologne church architecture&quot; from 1150 to 1250.

In the Middle Ages and the early modern period, Cologne was consistently among the 30 largest cities in Western Europe. This indicates the importance of the merchant center on the Rhine, because, in these periods, the number of inhabitants can be read as a good indicator of economic prosperity. However, Cologne could hardly ever count itself among the leading metropolises in Western Europe. Around 1200, the archbishops expanded the city and made it the capital of their sphere of influence; with a population of 40,000, Cologne reached a size comparable to London and Paris and was thus among the 10 largest cities in Western Europe.

In the following three centuries, the Rhine city, as a merchant center, unfolded a tightly linked trading network that included the Hanseatic towns of the Baltic Sea, in the west London and Bruges, but also trading places such as Bordeaux and Leipzig, and in the south the centers of Milan and Venice. Within this network, Cologne developed a strong but not dominant position. While other cities continued to grow, Cologne never exceeded a population of about 45,000 until the end of the 18th century. As early as 1300, the Flanders city of Ghent became a mercantile center of cloth industry with 64,000 inhabitants, and thus the largest city in the northwest; in those years Paris already reached a population of 75,000 and Milan, as a commercial metropolis, had about 100,000 inhabitants.

When Cologne was elevated to Free Imperial City status at the end of the 15th century, it was the largest city in the Holy Roman Empire, but only one of several important trading centers between the Scheldt and Elbe. Among them were in Flanders the cities of Ghent (45,000), Bruges and Tournai (35,000 each), as well as Brussels (33,000) and Antwerp (30,000), and in the southern part of Germany the cities of Nuremberg (38,000) and Augsburg (30,000); of the Hanseatic cities, the most important were Hamburg, Gdansk (Danzig) (30,000 each) and Lübeck (25.000). The dominant commercial places of Western Europe were Milan and Venice (100,000 each); among the political centers, the most numerous population had Naples (125,000), Paris (94,000), and London (50,000).

In the second half of the 16th century, trade flows increasingly shifted away from the Rhine to sea routes, diminishing Cologne&#x27;s influence on the long-distance trade network. Cologne did continue to maintain its population of around 40,000 until the 18th century. This is remarkably enough given the belligerent and epidemic vicissitudes that hit other commercial centers. Nevertheless, the city of Cologne became relatively less important and its commercial sphere of influence was mainly reduced to the regional environment. Antwerp established itself around 1560 with 100,000 inhabitants as the commercial metropolis of the northwest.

The military conflicts of the Thirty Years&#x27; War were by and large beneficial for Cologne because it was considered impregnable and could benefit from the arms trade; in any case, the Rhine city did not suffer a blow like the cities of Nuremberg, Augsburg or Magdeburg, all three until then on a steep growth path. Cologne had little share in the Atlantic trade that began in the 17th century, which made Amsterdam (180,000) to the Netherlands trading metropolis and Hamburg (70,000) the largest German trading city. Thus in 1700, Cologne dropped out of the top 30 list of largest cities in Western Europe. Increasingly, population growth was absorbed by the political centers such as London (575,000), Paris (500,000), and Vienna (114,000), all on the way to a form of modern European metropolises. Berlin (50,000) still had its dynamic growth ahead of it, and achieved the status of a major urban center (&quot;Grossstadt&quot;) only in 1763, when its population exceeded permanently 100,000 inhabitants.

With the onset of industrialization, Cologne doubled its population between 1810 (45,000) and 1846 (90,000) and was in 1850 the sixth largest city in Central Europe after Berlin, Vienna, Hamburg, Prague and Breslau. In the same period however, London was already inhabited by more than 2 million people, and Paris population surpassed 1 million. Industrialization as the driver of city size was exemplified by the British industrial cities Liverpool, Glasgow and Manchester, all exceeding 300,000 inhabitants by 1850.

During the entrepreneurial boom of the Gründerzeit, Cologne benefited from the railroad network that crossed the Rhine in the heart of the city. Cologne managed to increase its population — also through generous expansion of the urban area — to 650,000 by World War I. After the war, Cologne was one of the four largest cities in the German Empire, after Berlin (1.9 million) and Hamburg (985,000) and about equal with Munich (630,000). In 1939, more than 770,000 people lived in Cologne. The city was able to recover after the extensive destruction in World War II and grew by more than 30% between 1939 and 1975 sustained by a very diversified economic structure. In 2000, Cologne, as megacity with more than one million inhabitants, was Germany&#x27;s fourth-largest city after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich; in northwestern Europe, Cologne ranked sixth after London, Paris, Hamburg, Brussels and Copenhagen. When considering Western Europe (EU in 2000 borders), the Rhine city was among the 20 largest metropolises.

==Early history==
=== Roman period ===


In 39 BC the Germanic tribe of the Ubii entered into an agreement with the forces of the Roman General Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and settled on the left bank of the Rhine. Their headquarters was &quot;Oppidum Ubiorum&quot; (settlement of the Ubii) and at the same time an important Roman military base. In 50 AD the Cologne-born Agrippina the Younger, wife of the Emperor Claudius, asked for her home village to be raised to the status of a &quot;colonia&quot; — a city under Roman law. It was then renamed &quot;Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis&quot; (colony of Claudius and the altar of Agrippina), shortened to &quot;Colonia Agrippina&quot; (Colony of Agrippina). In 80 AD the Eifel Aqueduct was built. It was one of the longest aqueducts of the Roman Empire, delivering 20,000 cubic metres of water to the city every day. Ten years later, the &quot;colonia&quot; became the capital of the Roman province of Lower Germany, &quot;Germania Inferior&quot;, with a total population of 45,000 people occupying 96.8 hectares.

In 260 AD Postumus made Cologne the capital of the Gallic Empire, which included the Gallic provinces, the German provinces to the left of the Rhine, Britannia, and the provinces of Hispania. The Gallic Empire lasted only fourteen years.

By the 3rd century, only some 20,000 people lived in and around the town. In 310 AD, Emperor Constantine I had a bridge constructed over the Rhine, guarded by the &quot;castellum Divitia&quot;. Divitia later became a part of Cologne with the name &quot;Deutz&quot;.

The presence of Jews in Cologne was documented in AD 321. When exactly the first Jews arrived in the Rhineland area cannot now be established, but the Cologne community claims to be the oldest north of the Alps. As early as 321 AD, an edict by the Emperor Constantine allowed Jews to be elected to the City Council.

=== Frankish rule ===
Colonia was pillaged several times by the Franks in the 4th century. Two lavish burial sites located near the Cathedral date from this period. In 355 AD the Alemanni tribes besieged the town for 10 months, finally taking and plundering it. At the time, the garrison of Colonia Agrippina was under the generalship of Marcus Vitellus. The Romans re-occupied the city several months afterwards by Julian. The city finally fell to the Ripuarian Franks in 462 AD.

Cologne served as a base for the Carolingian conversion of the Saxons and Frisians. In 795 the chaplain to Charlemagne, Hildebold, was elevated to the newly created archbishopric of Cologne. After the death of Charlemagne, Cologne became part of Middle Francia. Archbishop Gunther was excommunicated in 863 for his support of the divorce and remarriage of Lothair II. In 873 Gunther&#x27;s successor Wilbert consecrated what would become known as the &quot;Alter Dom&quot; (old cathedral), the predecessor of Cologne Cathedral. With the death of Lothair in 876, Cologne fell to East Francia under Louis the German. The city was burnt down by Vikings in the winter of 881/2.

In the early 10th century, the dukes of Lorraine seceded from East Francia. Cologne passed to East Francia but was soon reconquered by Henry the Fowler, deciding its fate as a city of the Holy Roman Empire (and eventually Germany) rather than France.

== Cologne in the Holy Roman Empire ==
===Later Middle Ages===
Cologne&#x27;s first Christian bishop was Maternus. He was responsible for the construction of the first cathedral, a square building erected early in the 4th century. In 794, Hildebold was the first bishop of Cologne to be appointed archbishop. Bruno I (925–965), younger brother of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, founded several monasteries here.

The dynasty of the Ezzonids, later Counts of Berg, counted 7 archbishops during that period and consolidated the powers of the archbishopric over imperial affairs. The archbishops of Cologne became very influential as advisers to the Saxon, Salian and Hohenstaufen dynasties. From 1031 they also held the office of Arch-Chancellor of Italy. Their authority culminated under Archbishop Engelbert II of Berg, imperial administrator (Reichsprovisor) and tutor to the emperor&#x27;s son. Between 1216 and 1225, Engelbert fought for the establishment and security of the archdiocese of Cologne both as an ecclesiastical authority and as a secular territory. This led to his murder in 1225.

Construction of the Gothic cathedral started in 1248 under Konrad von Hochstaden. The eastern arm was completed and consecrated in 1322. Construction of the western arm was halted in 1475, and it would remain unfinished until 1880.

In 1074 the commune was formed. By the 13th century, the relationship between the city and its archbishop had become difficult, and after the Battle of Worringen in 1288, the forces of Brabant and the citizenry of Cologne captured Archbishop Siegfried of Westerburg (1274–97), resulting in almost complete freedom for the city. To regain his liberty the archbishop recognized the political independence of Cologne but reserved certain rights, notably the administration of justice.

 Long-distance trade in the Baltic intensified as the major trading towns came together in the Hanseatic League under the leadership of Lübeck. The League was a business alliance of trading cities and their guilds that dominated trade along the coast of Northern Europe. It flourished from the 1200 to 1500 and continued with lesser importance thereafter. The chief cities were Cologne on the Rhine, Hamburg and Bremen on the North Sea, and Lübeck on the Baltic. Cologne was a leading member, especially because of its trade with England. The Hanseatic League gave merchants special privileges in member cities, which dominated trade in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. Cologne&#x27;s hinterland in Germany gave it an added advantage over the other Hanseatic cities, and it became the largest city in Germany and the region. Cologne&#x27;s central location on the Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west and was the basis of Cologne&#x27;s growth. The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were based on the city&#x27;s major harbor, its location as a transport hub, and its entrepreneurial merchants who built ties with merchants in other Hanseatic cities.

Cologne effectively became a free city after 1288, and in 1475 it was formally made a free imperial city, a status that it held until annexed by France on May 28, 1796. The Archbishopric of Cologne was a state in its own right within the Holy Roman Empire, but the city was independent, and the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter it. Instead, they took up residence in Bonn and later in Brühl until they returned in 1821.
Cologne Cathedral housed sacred relics that made it a destination for many worshippers. With the bishop not resident, the city was ruled by patricians (merchants carrying on long-distance trade). The craftsmen formed guilds, which sought to obtain control of the towns. The guilds were governed by strict rules. A few were open to women. Society was divided into sharply demarcated classes: the clergy, physicians, merchants, and various guilds of artisans; full citizenship was not available to paupers. Political tensions arose from issues of taxation, public spending, regulation of business, and market supervision, as well as the limits of corporate autonomy.

The first pogrom against the Jews of Cologne occurred in 1349, when they were used as scapegoats for the Black Death. In 1424 they were evicted from the city. They were allowed back again in 1798.

== Cologne as Free Imperial City ==

=== Cologne Diocesan Feud ===
A dispute between Archbishop Ruprecht of the Palatinate and the chapter of Cologne cathedral eventually evolved into a war with international involvement in 1474, known as the Cologne Diocesan Feud. This plunged the city of Cologne into an existential crisis. Since the archbishop refrained to abide by the financial agreements he had entered into when elected in 1463, the cathedral chapter appointed Landgrave Hermann IV of Hesse as diocesan administrator in 1473. Perceived as insubordination, the archbishop in consequence asked for military assistance from the powerful Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, ruler of Flanders and Dutch regions. When Charles started the campaign with a well equipped army and headed for a siege of Neuss, part of Cologne electorate, and threatened to subsequently attack Cologne, the burghers feared for their independence. The city began extensive preparations for war, reinforced the city walls and sent a contingent of troops to defend Neuss. Within months, the citizenry succeeded in persuading Emperor Friedrich III to intervene with an imperial army; their arrival before Neuss forced the Burgundian troops to withdraw from the siege. Subsequently, the emperor officially elevated Cologne to the status of a Free imperial city. However, since the city itself had to bear the extraordinarily high war costs, including the maintenance of the imperial army, the city&#x27;s finances were completely shattered. Cologne needed decades to regain its financial leeway.

=== Steelyard for English trade ===
Traditionally, the most important stronghold for Cologne&#x27;s long-distance commerce was the Steelyard (Stalhof) in London. This prestigious trading post, endowed with trading privileges, allowed Cologne merchants to dominate English trade along the Rhine. The status of the steelyard was the cause of the Anglo-Hanseatic War in 1469, which was not settled until 1474. This dispute was primarily fought as a privateer war. Cologne however remained neutral adhering to its special relations with the English capital for more than 300 years, and even accepted being excluded from the Hanseatic League in 1471. Only after the League had prevailed in the caper war, the steelyard being restituted to the merchants, and the old privileges being renewed by the English crown, Cologne was re-incorporated into Hanseatic League in 1476. The English trade remained a major asset in Cologne&#x27;s long-distance commerce until the second half of the 16th century, and England continued to flourish as primary market for wine traded from Cologne. The city’s merchants succeeded in largely monopolizing the distribution of English tin. In addition, the Cologne merchants dominated the English trade in armaments (swords, armor, spears). Overall, Cologne prospered as merchant city until the middle of the 16th century, which continued to control the flow of goods across the Rhine from London to Italy and at the same time linked them with west-east trade routes to Frankfurt and Leipzig. In fact, Cologne merchants could be found in all European commercial centers. The central importance of Cologne&#x27;s commerce throughout the Reich was also reflected in the fact that the Cologne Mark was officially designated the Reichsmünzgewicht (imperial currency standard) by Emperor Charles V in 1524. The Cologne penny, 160 of which were struck from one Cologne mark, was a standard currency of the High Middle Ages.

=== Presence of emperor and king ===
Between 1484 and 1531, emperors and kings often spent time in Cologne, enabling Cologne patricians a welcome proximity to Habsburg dynasty. As an indirect result of the Cologne Diocesan Feud, in 1477 heir Maximilian of Austria had married Maria, Duchess of Burgundy, thus enabling Habsburg access to the rich Burgundian lands of Flanders and the Netherlands. To secure this inheritance as a permanent possession, the royal presence in the region proved to be beneficial. In 1484 Maximilian was crowned German king to become the German deputy of his imperial father Frederick III. The extended festivities took place in Cologne, giving the City that year the appearance of Habsburg capital. Maximilian appointed the Cologne merchant Nicasius Hackeney as his chief financial advisor. In 1505, the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) was held in Cologne with all grandeur; it was perceived from contemporaries as the high point of Maximilian&#x27;s imperial rule. Another diet, although started in Trier, was continued and concluded in 1512 in Cologne. Charles V was crowned Roman-German king in 1520, Ferdinand I in 1531. In both cases coronation ceremonies adhered to the customary practice known for centuries. Cologne archbishop acted as coronator in the ceremony in Palatine Chapel in Aachen, thereafter the coronation procession moved to Cologne to pay homage to the Three Magi in Cologne Cathedral. The final coronation festivities took place with great splendor in the city of Cologne. For the celebration in 1531, the Cologne Council had Anton Woensam produce a detailed Cologne city view, used as present for the newly crowned Ferdinand to highlight Cologne&#x27;s status and greatness. Emperor Charles V. also raised a Cologne patrician to his personal adviser. The twelve-time Cologne mayor Arnt von Siegen became a consultee in topics of faith policy. Unsurprisingly, the Emperor resided in the Siegen city palace at Holzmarkt during his visits to Cologne in 1545 and 1550.

=== Oligarchic cronies in the council ===
After the Cologne Diocesan Feud in 1475, Cologne was elevated as a Free Imperial City, but left with significant financial burdens that brought the city to the brink of insolvency. The debtors were predominantly the wealthy merchants of Cologne, who had been forced to subscribe to compulsory bonds for financing purposes. The council, dominated by these circles, tried to maintain the city&#x27;s solvency by raising indirect taxes – especially on food and wine – in order to assure the debt service.

In fact, during the heyday of the imperial city, Cologne Council was dominated by a small group of influential and very wealthy families who regarded themselves as Cologne patriciate; through a circle of council friends, they ensured that only initiated people moved up. This created an oligarchic rule in which corruption and favoritism increasingly spread, which became known proverbially as &quot;Kölscher Klüngel&quot; (Cologne cronyism). A center was formed by a lobby of councilmen who called themselves &quot;krensgin&quot; (chaplet) and who apparently made most of the important decisions, even without consulting the other members of the 49-member city council. The non-transparent financial practices and the high taxation sometimes perceived as arbitrary led to an ongoing dispute within the city&#x27;s leadership circles, which, after an attempted overthrow averted in 1482, was only resolved in 1513 by an amendment of the city constitution known as &quot;Transfixbrief&quot; (Transfix letter).

In 1481, councilor Werner von Lyskirchen, who was descended from one of Cologne&#x27;s old patrician families, used the latent discontent in cooperative circles (Gaffeln) and guilds to attempt a coup. The action, which went down in the chronicles as the &quot;Große Schickung&quot; (big dispatch) was quickly stifled by rival families and partisans, and Werner was eventually beheaded. The oligarchic structures that dominated the city remained. In the course of a dispute in 1512, the small circles in the council were tempted to bend the law and commit fraud in order to defend their privileges, at least from the point of view of rival citizens. A riot broke out in January 1513; the burghers organized in cooperative circles (Gaffeln) seized power and deprived the council of its authority. Ten former councilmen were convicted of misconduct and executed; the representatives of the Gaffeln reformed taxation and held a new election. New rules of conduct, intended to contain the re-emergence of oligarchic structures, were codified by December 1513 in an amendment letter (Transfixbrief), which supplemented the city constitution (Verbundbrief) in force since 1396. Among other things, the new regulations extended the rights of burghers, especially the inviolability of person and home.

=== Cathedral construction interrupted and suspended ===

When the city of Cologne mobilized all its forces in 1474 to arm itself against the advancing Duke of Burgundy, the construction work at Cologne Cathedral needed to be interrupted as well. The craftsmen were obliged to reinforce the city fortifications. Johann Kuyn von Frankenberg, the last master mason of the cathedral in the Middle Ages known by name, had to dissolve the masonry (Dombauhütte). After the war, Archbishop Hermann of Hesse refrained from continuing construction for about 30 years due to the excessive over-indebtedness of the Electorate of Cologne. He apparently used the donations, which continued to flow in abundance, to regain the financial leeway of the prince-archbishopric. It was not until his successor, Archbishop Philip II of Daun-Oberstein, that the cathedral masonry was re-established and the late gothic stained glass windows were installed in the north aisle of the Cathedral in 1508. They are considered to be of particularly high quality, for which the most respected representatives of the Cologne School of Painting created the designs. Eventually, the regular flow of construction activities stalled after 1525, because the most important financing instrument, the trade with indulgences, dried up due to the Reformation. At the latest in 1560, the cathedral construction was entirely suspended — and was only resumed in 1823.

=== Silk made in Cologne ===

Silk production, which had been costumary practice in Cologne since the early Middle Ages, experienced its last flowering by the middle of the 16th century. Along with Paris, Cologne was considered one of the great production centers north of the Alps. Around 1500, silk cloth probably made up for Cologne&#x27;s most successful export commerce. The production of silk fabrics was controlled by the Silk Office (Seidenamt), a guild in which predominantly women were active. This practice, which was maintained only in Cologne except in Paris, allowed a larger number of female guild masters to achieve considerable wealth. For the daughters of upper class families, entering the silk business became a recognized career prospect. The most famous female guild master was Fygen Lutzenkirchen, who is considered to be the most successful silk entrepreneur in Cologne and was one of the wealthiest citizens of Cologne around 1498. Silk production was closely linked to the silk trade because the raw silk had to be imported from northern Italian trading centers, usually via Venice and Milan. The silk weaving and craft processing – braid weaving, silk embroidery – was organized mainly through the putting-out system. The wholesaler prefinanced the raw materials and left the craftswomen to work at home. The main buyers of Cologne&#x27;s silk products were the clergy of Cologne and the export markets in Frankfurt, Strasbourg and Leipzig. On the markets in Flanders (Bruges, Antwerp, Ghent), Cologne merchants increasingly came up against intense local competition, which by the middle of the 16th century became increasingly noticeable in Cologne as well. At the end of its heyday in 1560, Cologne counted 60 to 70 silk merchants who processed 700 bales of silk each year.

=== Patricians seek prestigious splendor ===
From the last decades of the 15th century on, the patricians of Cologne felt an increased need to express their status and therefore developed a lively activity as benefactors. Many of them ordered large winged altarpieces, the wealthiest financed entire chapels or parts of church furnishings. Therefore, by the end of the 18th century, in &quot;Cologne were more medieval works of art than anywhere else in the world.&quot;

Some families had large courtyards built in the city. Nicasius Hackeney, who was particularly close to the emperor Maximilian as his chief financial administrator, had the Hackeney&#x27;schen Hof built around 1505 at Neumarkt, which also served the emperor as a city palace. Johann Rinck from a dynasty of influential merchants and mayors built at the same time the Rinkenhof opposite St. Mauritius. Both palaces demonstrated with a polygonal stair tower the importance of their owners; a generation later, the twelve-time mayor Arnt von Siegen equipped his family mansion on Holzmarkt with a comparable tower. Thus, these towers became a status demonstrating meaning, cited in public buildings until the 19th century (for example, at the Zeughaus and at the Stapelhaus). The foundation of chapels should not only serve the representative memory, but above all the salvation of the donors. In 1493, mayor Johann von Hirtz donated a chapel in St. Maria im Kapitol, today known as Hirtz Chapel; Johannes Hardenrath and his wife Agnes van Merle decided to commission the New Sacristy at the Kartäuserkirche (Carthusian Church) St. Barbara in 1510. Their intention materialized into the most refined sling vault of late Gothic church architecture in Cologne.

From the pronounced need for prestige benefited the numerous late Gothic masters of the Cologne School of Painting, whose best known were commissioned with large-scale altarpieces. Among the most notable painters were the Master of the Holy Kinship, sometimes identified with Lambert von Luytge, and the Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece, who has been introduced as a &quot;genius without a name&quot; in recent art history. Both show the late Gothic painting in highest perfection expressed in the somewhat conservative Cologne style. The most sophisticated mastery of Cologne late Gothic sculpture is realized in the rood screen of St. Pantaleon Church, attributed to Master Tilman, and donated by Abbot Johannes Lüninck around 1502.

=== Printed in Cologne ===

The emerging technology of letterpress printing quickly was adopted in Cologne; as early as 1464, Ulrich Zell printed the first book. Until the end of the 15th century, there was evidence of 20 printing works in Cologne, producing more than 1200 different editions. This made Cologne – after Venice, Paris and Rome – a leading book printing center in Europe. For the families involved in the printing and publishing business, such as the Quentel, Birckmann and Gymnich, it was a prospering venture. Many of them expanded to other metropolises in Europe and formed cross-city cooperatives. Peter Quentel, the busiest in the new industry, was re-elected as a Cologne councilman for many years. In 1524, Quentel published an edition in Low German language of Luther’s New Testament translation; from the late 1520s, however, the printing and distribution of Lutheran books was banned by the Cologne Council. Again, it was Peter Quentel who published the first complete German translation of the Bible by Johann Dietenberger (the so-called Dietenberger Bible), which was printed in Mainz in 1534 and eventually gained recognition as one of the Catholic correction Bibles.

By developing into a leading publishing place for Latin-language works Cologne gained an exceptional position compared to all other book printing centers of the empire. The Cologne publishers aimed at nationwide distribution and unleashed a program including primarily religious, scientific, and humanistic works. For example, along with Basel, Cologne was the leading printing center to publish the writings of the humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam. Moreover, Cologne remained the only one of the major imperial cities to remain Catholic, and thus offered a comprehensive book program of counter-Reformation works that continued to argue in Latin. The book that, from today&#x27;s perspective, most prominently represents the Cologne printing industry, however, is the Koelhoff Chronicle with the title &quot;Die Cronica van der hilliger Stat van Coellen&quot; (Chronicle of the Holy City of Cologne): the work written in the Ripuarian dialect of Cologne region was published in 1499 by Johann Koelhoff the Younger. Today, it is considered the high point of late medieval Cologne city history.

=== Mockery of obscurors from Cologne ===

At the beginning of the 16th century, a pamphleteering battle developed from Cologne throughout the empire over whether Jewish books — and in particular the Talmud — should be confiscated and burnt, with the intention of stifling the Jewish faith. The driver of this anti-Jewish action was Johannes Pfefferkorn, a Jew convert to Catholic Christianity who was apparently supported by the Cologne Dominican Order; the Dominican theologian Jacob van Hoogstraaten, prior to the convent of Cologne, and acting as a papal inquisitor, flanked the anti-Jewish religious propaganda with expert opinions and prohibitory pamphlets, which were mainly directed against Johannes Reuchlin, a leading humanist and Hebraist. This anti-Jewish attitude also found expression in Cologne Cathedral. A series of stone reliefs, donated by the former Jew Victor von Carben, exemplifies the change from Judaism to Christianity. The controversy, which spread across the whole Empire and engaged numerous Humanists and Emperor Maximilian, exposed van Hoogstraaten and the Cologne University faculty to the ridicule of the Letters of Obscure Men written by humanists, which discredited Cologne&#x27;s theological conservatism for decades to come. The book controversy was eventually eclipsed by the onset of the Reformation.

=== Simple-minded apprehension averted ===
The pioneering theses of Martin Luther triggered ongoing controversy also in Cologne over whether and to what degree the church should renew itself. On the occasion of the coronation of Emperor Charles V in 1520, the writings of the Augustinian monk were publicly burned in the cathedral courtyard and Luther’s theses persecuted as heresy. The city council decided in 1527 to banish all Lutherans of the city, but claimed to pursue a policy of reconciliation, which the city defended to the Diet of 1532 – as did the imperial cities of Nuremberg, Augsburg or Frankfurt. Persons who publicly professed Reformation ideas, such as the preacher Adolf Clarenbach and Peter Fliesteden were handed over by the council to the archbishop&#x27;s jurisdiction. Archbishop Hermann of Wied, who wanted to prove his authority in religious matters, sentenced them to death at the stake. In the following years however, the God-fearing archbishop, who perceived church debauchery as an abomination, tried to set the Archbishopric on a course of renewal; the efforts eventually proved to be in vain. In the attempt to bridge the opposing positions of the faith dispute, Hermann progressively endorsed Reformation ideas, and finally invited the reform theologians Martin Bucer and Philipp Melanchthon to the Rhine, who published the programmatic paper &quot;Einfältiges Bedenken&quot; (Simple-minded Apprehension) on behalf of the archbishop. The counter-position, deep-routed in the Catholic conviction of the cathedral chapter, was formulated by Johannes Gropper, one of the leading Catholic theologians of his time. In 1544, the bishop had a preacher&#x27;s pulpit erected in Cologne Cathedral, with the intention to emphasize the importance of the preacher&#x27;s word in accordance to reformist doctrine. Thus, the Catholic party in the archdiocese and in the Cologne city council finally became suspicious of Hermann; longtime councillor Arnt von Siegen, a devout Catholic, leveraged his access to Charles V. In 1547, the emperor forced the archbishop to resign. In this way, the last, possibly too simple-minded attempt, to outbalance the schism in the empire, proved to be a complete failure. The successors, the archbishops Adolf and Anton of Schaumburg, steered the archbishopric back on a clear Catholic course.

=== Trade routes to Flanders ===

For the Cologne commerce, the trade route to Flanders and the North Sea was of foundational importance. In the 16th century, it needed to be realigned as trading flows shifted from Bruges to Antwerp, which emerged as the economic center of Europe in the mid-16th century. By 1526, the city on the Scheldt surpassed 50,000 inhabitants and outnumbered Cologne, and by 1560 Antwerp had doubled its population. In contrast, the importance of the Hanseatic Kontor of Bruges faded until the end of the 15th century, since Bruges could no longer be approached by seagoing ships due to the silting of the Zwin. Antwerp benefited from overseas trade flows; Portuguese merchants made the city a hub for long-distance import, for example to distribute sugar and pepper. Eventually, the Hanseatic League moved its Kontor to Antwerp in 1545 and had a prestigious new trading house built by Cornelis Floris II from 1563 to 1569; however, it was only used to one-fifth of its capacity. Cologne merchants found it increasingly difficult to hold their own against international competition. To avoid confessional unrest in Antwerp, Portuguese, Italian as well as Flemish merchants settled directly in Cologne. They imported grain and furs, but above all cloth and silk fabrics, which put them in direct competition with Cologne&#x27;s production. At times, the non-Cologne merchants bundled a third of Cologne&#x27;s long-distance trade.

=== Renaissance in Cologne ===
In the 16th century, the patricians of Cologne began to reflect the Renaissance art trends they got to know on their trade journeys especially in Flanders, when commissioning works of art. In 1517, the Cologne families Hackeney, Hardenrath, von Merle, von Straelen, Salm and von Berchem donated a rood screen for St. Maria im Kapitol; the elaborate work was ordered from an art carver in Mechelen, who thus made the Flemish Renaissance known in Cologne. The town hall’s extension, called Löwenhof (Lion‘s Courtyard), was built in 1540 by Laurenz Cronenberg blending elements in late Gothic and Renaissance style. The Antwerp-born Cornelis Floris was commissioned by the cathedral chapter in 1561 to erect the epitaphs of the two archbishops from the house of Schaumburg, whose depiction gained proverbial recognition in Cologne as the Floris style. Floris was also requested for the design of the city hall loggia, which was built from 1567; the construction, however, was assigned to the Cologne stonemason Wilhelm Vernukken. The most sought-after Cologne Renaissance painter was Barthel Bruyn the Elder, who developed his own form for portrait paintings in Cologne. Families who could afford it, however, had their members portrayed in London by the royal court painter Hans Holbein the Younger.

=== Efforts for the Cologne trade ===
In the 1550s, it became apparent that international trade was undergoing a fundamental change. Kontors based trade underpinned with trading privileges was losing cohesive strength; as overseas destinations were increasingly discovered, long-distance trade shifted away from the Rhine to the North Sea. Antwerp, which by 1560 had more than 100,000 inhabitants, emerged as the economic center of Europe and developed great commercial dynamism, displacing the Cologne merchants. In southern Germany, the imperial cities of Augsburg and Nürnberg had also developed into important trading hubs; both cities had grown to over 30,000 inhabitants, almost the size of Cologne. This was also true for Magdeburg, which benefited from the staple rights on the Elbe. The Cologne wholesalers, who dominated the city&#x27;s council, therefore sought to strengthen Cologne&#x27;s position in international trade. In 1553, the Cologne commodity exchange was founded inspired by Antwerp practice, which allowed the trading of commodity contracts. Additionally, the bill of exchange business became established when the Antwerp finance business partially shifted to Cologne. In order to strengthen its traditional business branches – especially wine and cloth – Cologne became intensively involved in the Hanseatic League and in 1556 created the role of a syndic, a kind of secretary-general in an institution that until then had not known any representative. The position was assigned to Heinrich Sudermann of Cologne, who was to use diplomatic means to prolong the old trading privileges. However, after Elizabeth I had taken up the government in England in 1558, it was not possible to make her endorse the continuation of the privileges for the Stalhof in London, whose importance therefore diminished over the years. After the relocation of the flanders Kontor to Antwerp and the construction of a respresentative trading post from 1563 to 1569, Sudermann struggled - ultimately in vain - to give the Kontor greater economic relevance. More successful was the initiative of the Cologne Council to strengthen the trading business on the Rhine by building a new stacking house (Stapelhaus) (1558-1561). The building allowed, above all, to handle the fish trade more effectively; despite all international adversities, Cologne still benefited considerably from the Stapelrecht, that continued to remain in force.

=== King&#x27;s coronation in Frankfurt ===
Maximilian II got crowned German king in November 1562 in Frankfurt am Main - and not in Aachen, as generations of his ancestors. The ritualized procession that the coronator and king had celebrated since time immemorial from Aachen to Cologne to visit the shrine of the Three Kings was dispensed with. The king skipped the tradition, to pay homage to the Magi in Cologne. The coronation festivities, which for centuries had guaranteed Cologne a closeness to the imperial dominion and had given it a great character since 1484, were held in Frankfurt am Main. This Cologne setback resulted because Archbishop Frederick IV of Wied had not yet been papally confirmed at the time of the coronation; because of the autumn season, the great men of the Empire avoided the long journey from Frankfurt, where the election had taken place anyway, to Aachen and Cologne. In addition, the king sympathized with Protestant ideas and found relic homages out of date. All subsequent imperial coronations also took place in Frankfurt; as coronator henceforth celebrated the archbishop of Mainz. Thus, this relocation detrimented the centuries-old narrative of the &quot;Holy Cologne.&quot; Not coincidentally, from 1567, Cologne councilors built a city hall loggia, which in its Renaissance style deliberately cited the triumphal arch architecture of Roman antiquity, thus recalling the historical greatness of Cologne.

=== Regulation of the Rhine ===
Since the High Middle Ages, the people of Cologne had observed with concern that the Rhine began to shift its river bed on the right bank near Poll. Floods and ice flows broadened this deviation. To prevent an eastern breach of the Rhine between Poll and Deutz, Cologne planned to fortify the bank with the so-called &quot;Poll Heads&quot; (Poller Köpfe), but it was not until 1557 that the council was able to reach an agreement with the archbishop on the measures. In 1560, the large-scale project was started and continued for more than 250 years. In total, three heavy headlands were built as shore fortification. In addition to hundreds of ships laid aground, willow plantings and groynes were brought in to prevent deviations in the course of the river. Iron-reinforced oak logs – weighted down with basalt boulders and connected by heavy crossbeams – were driven into the river bottom. The northern headland is said to have had a length of 1500 meters.

=== Map based city administration ===

The religious and economic unrest afflicting the Spanish Netherlands from 1566 onward was observed in Cologne with apprehensiveness. The Spanish general Duke of Alba, sent to Brussels in 1567 as the new governor-general of the Spanish crown, sought to quell Flemish discontent with draconian measures and military force. Because of the tensions, many refugees left Antwerp and settled in Cologne; among the most illustrious were Jan Rubens, father of the subsequently famous painter Peter Paul, and Anna of Saxony, wife of William of Orange, who eventually became governor of the united Dutch provinces. Duke Alba therefore also exerted considerable pressure on the city of Cologne to keep refugees out of the Rhine city and to secure military transit routes to the Habsburg possessions in southern Europe.

The Cologne Council endeavored to meet Spanish demands for improved city administration and a rigorous attitude toward refugees. To this end, as a modern administrative measure of the time, the council had a detailed Bird&#x27;s-eye view of the city drawn up, to enhance the mastery of inhabitants and immigrants. The cartographer Arnold Mercator drew up the plan at a scale of 1:2450, striving for a work that satisfied cartographic-scientific standards; the map was based on a comparatively accurate survey of the city&#x27;s topography and showed the building tracts in the aim to create a spatial effect with a skillful mixture of elevation and bird&#x27;s-eye view. Given its detailed and true-to-scale representation, the so-called &quot;Mercator Plan&quot; is considered today to be the first reliable city plan of Cologne and is perceived as one of the first ever cartographically correct city maps.

=== Futile pacification efforts ===

The economic region of the Spanish Netherlands, so foundational for Cologne&#x27;s prosperity, did not come to rest in the 1570s. In 1575, the Spanish king Philipp II had to declare a state bankruptcy; the Spanish occupation troops of the Netherlands remained without pay. In 1576, they went marauding through Flanders and, looting, wreaked havoc in the city of Antwerp. This caused proverbial horror as the Spanish Fury and strengthened the resistance of the Flemings and Dutch against the Spanish crown. In the course of the riots, the newly built Hanseatic Kontor in Antwerp was also looted several times. The merchants of Cologne tried in vain to be compensated for the damage; in the following years, the Kontor lost its economic importance.

The Union of Arras, agreed in January 1579 and followed promptly by the Union of Utrecht, marked the arising separation of the Spanish Netherlands, from which the states of the Netherlands and Belgium would ultimately emerge. The Union of Utrecht, dominated by the Province of Holland, was also joined by almost all the Brabant and Flanders cities. To pacify the disputes in the provinces, which formally still were part of the Holy Roman Empire, Emperor Rudolf II, the brother-in-law of the Spanish king, sought a negotiated settlement. The so-called Pacification Day took place in Cologne from April to November 1579, because the imperial city, as a strategically important metropolis, could be accepted as a neutral location and provide the necessary infrastructure for the delegations. The representatives of the Netherlands, the emperor and the Spanish crown were accommodated in the city palaces of Cologne&#x27;s councillors. The negotiations themselves took place in the City hall called Gürzenich. However, the conferences ended without any agreement. 
Today, Cologne&#x27;s Pacification Day is understood as the starting point for the emergence of an independent Dutch state. How vitally the Dutch disputes affected Cologne&#x27;s interests got evidence in 1580, when Dutch warships came up the Rhine and advanced as far as Cologne. The coordinated efforts of a fleet of Rhenish electors promptly drove off the invaders. Overall, developments were unfavorable to Cologne&#x27;s economic interests. The unrest severely disrupted Cologne&#x27;s trade routes to Flanders; in addition, the Dutch were able to control sea access to the Rhine. Both gravely impeded Cologne&#x27;s trade flows and brought Cologne&#x27;s trade with England to an almost complete standstill.

==Early modern period==

In the beginning of Early modern period, Reformation continuously tempted the leading classes of Cologne. In 1582, Archbishop Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg converted to the Reformed faith and attempted to reform practices in the city&#x27;s churches. This was violently opposed by the Wittelsbachs, leading to the Cologne War. The city&#x27;s population, following the lead of the cathedral clergy, generally preferred the influence of the Pope in Rome to the Archbishop on their doorstep and so the city was spared the worst of the devastation inflicted on the surrounding towns and countryside.

From 1583 to 1761, all ruling archbishops came from the Wittelsbach dynasty. As powerful electors, the archbishops repeatedly challenged Cologne&#x27;s free status during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated legal affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means, usually to the advantage of the city.

In the period of the persecution of witches (1435–1655), 37 people were executed in Cologne, mostly during the reign of Archbishop Ferdinand of Bavaria in the years 1626 to 1631. One of those executed was Katharina Henot, the first known female postmaster of Germany and an influential citizen. She apparently fell victim to a conspiracy of her enemies among the city authorities after proceedings which were flawed according to the laws of the period.

==Modern history==
=== Napoleonic and Prussian period ===

The French Revolutionary Wars resulted in the occupation of Cologne and the Rhineland in 1794. In the following years the French consolidated their presence. In 1798 the city became an arrondissement in the newly created Département de la Roer. In the same year the University of Cologne was closed. In 1801 all citizens of Cologne were granted French citizenship. In 1804 Napoléon Bonaparte visited the city together with his wife Joséphine de Beauharnais. The French occupation ended in 1814, when Cologne was occupied by Prussian and Russian troops. In 1815 Cologne and the Rhineland were allocated to Prussia.

=== Weimar Republic ===
From the end of World War I until 1926, Cologne was occupied by the British Army of the Rhine under the terms of the armistice and the subsequent Peace Treaty of Versailles.

In contrast to the harsh measures taken by French occupation troops, the British acted with more tact towards the local population. Konrad Adenauer, mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and a future West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially that the British opposed French plans for a permanent Allied occupation of the Rhineland.

The demilitarization of the Rhineland required the fortifications to be dismantled. This was taken as an opportunity to create two green belts (&quot;Grüngürtel&quot;) around the city by converting the fortifications and their surroundings, which had been kept clear for artillery, into large public parks. This project was completed in 1933.

In 1919 Cologne University, closed by the French in 1798, was founded anew. It was considered a substitute for the German University of Strasbourg, which became part of France along with the rest of Alsace. Cologne prospered during the Weimar Republic and progress was made especially in governance, city planning and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities.

As Cologne competed to host the Olympics, a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. Early in the 1920s civil aviation was permitted once more, and Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to Berlin Tempelhof Airport.

=== Nazi Germany ===
At the beginning of Nazi Germany, Cologne was considered difficult by the Nazis because of deep-rooted communist and Catholic influences in the city. The Nazis were always struggling for control of the city.

Local elections on 13 March 1933 resulted in the Nazi Party winning 39.6% of the vote, followed by the catholic Zentrum Party with 28.3%, the Social Democratic Party of Germany with 13.2%, and the Communist Party of Germany with 11.1%. One day later, on 14 March, Nazi followers occupied the city hall and took over government. Communist and Social Democratic members of the city assembly were imprisoned, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed.

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the Jewish population of Cologne was about 20,000. By 1939, 40% of the city&#x27;s Jews had emigrated. The vast majority of those who remained had been deported to concentration camps by 1941. The trade fair grounds next to the Deutz train station were used to herd the Jewish population together for deportation to the death camps and for disposal of their household goods by public sale. On &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938, Cologne&#x27;s synagogues were desecrated or set on fire.

It was planned to rebuild a large part of the inner city, with a main road connecting the Deutz station and the main station, which was to be moved from next to the cathedral to an area adjacent to today&#x27;s university campus, with a huge field for rallies, the Maifeld, next to the main station. The Maifeld, between the campus and the Aachener Weiher artificial lake, was the only part of this over-ambitious plan to be realized before the start of the war. After the war, the remains of the Maifeld were buried with rubble from bombed buildings and turned into a park with rolling hills, which was christened Hiroshima-Nagasaki-Park in August 2004 as a memorial to the victims of the nuclear bombs of 1945. An inconspicuous memorial to the victims of the Nazi regime is situated on one of the hills.

On the night of 30–31 May 1942, Cologne was the target for the first 1,000 bomber raid of the war. Between 469 and 486 people, around 90% of them civilians, were reported killed, more than 5,000 were injured, and more than 45,000 lost their homes. It was estimated that up to 150,000 of Cologne&#x27;s population of around 700,000 left the city after the raid. The Royal Air Force lost 43 of the 1,103 bombers sent. By the end of World War II, 90% of Cologne&#x27;s buildings had been destroyed by Allied aerial bombing raids, most of them flown by the RAF.

On 10 November 1944, a dozen members of the anti-Nazi Ehrenfeld Group were hanged in public. Six of them were 16-year-old boys of the Edelweiss Pirates youth gang, including Barthel Schink; Fritz Theilen survived.

The bombings continued and people moved out. By May 1945 only 20,000 residents remained out of 770,000.

The outskirts of Cologne were reached by US troops on 4 March 1945. The inner city on the left bank of the Rhine was captured in half a day on 6 March 1945, meeting only minor resistance. Because the Hohenzollernbrücke was destroyed by retreating German pioneers, the boroughs on the right bank remained under German control until mid-April 1945.

=== Postwar Cologne ===
Although Cologne was larger than its neighbors, Düsseldorf was chosen as the political capital of the newly established Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Bonn as the (provisional) capital of the Federal Republic. Cologne benefited from being sandwiched between the two important political centers of West Germany by becoming home to a large number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, a new situation has been politically co-ordinated with the new federal capital, Berlin.

In 1945 architect and urban planner Rudolf Schwarz called Cologne the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest heap of debris&quot;. Schwarz designed the 1947 reconstruction master plan, which called for the construction of several new thoroughfares through the downtown area, especially the &quot;Nord-Süd-Fahrt&quot; (North-South-Drive). The plan took into consideration that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already evolved to some extent under the Nazi administration, but construction became easier now that the majority of downtown lots were undeveloped. The destruction of the famous twelve Romanesque churches, including St. Gereon&#x27;s Basilica, Great St. Martin, St. Maria im Kapitol and about a dozen others during World War II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural substance to the city. The rebuilding of these churches and other landmarks like the Gürzenich was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of St. Kunibert was finished.

It took some time to rebuild the city. In 1959 the city&#x27;s population reached pre-war numbers again. Afterwards the city grew steadily, and in 1975 the number exceeded one million inhabitants for about a year. The population stayed just below a million for the next 35 years, before again surpassing the million inhabitant mark in 2010.

In the 1980s and 1990s Cologne&#x27;s economy prospered from two factors. First, the steady growth in the number of media companies in both the private and the public sector. Catering especially to these companies is the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strongly visual focal point in downtown Cologne and includes the &quot;KölnTurm&quot; (Cologne Tower), one of Cologne&#x27;s most prominent highrises. Secondly, a permanent improvement in traffic infrastructure, which makes Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.

Due to the economic success of the Cologne Trade Fair, the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. The original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, are rented out to RTL, Germany&#x27;s largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.

Cologne was at the centre of the 2015–16 New Year&#x27;s Eve sexual assaults in Germany. A controversy started after Muslims in Cologne sought to build the Cologne Central Mosque, which was completed in 2017.

Most important for the history of Cologne since the Middle Ages is the Cologne City Archive, which was the largest in Germany. Its building collapsed during the construction of an extension to the underground railway system on 3 March 2009.

<text>Étienne Dolet (; 3 August 15093 August 1546) was a French scholar, translator and printer. He was a controversial figure throughout his lifetime, which was buffeted by the opposing forces of the Renaissance and the French Inquisition. His early attacks upon the Inquisition and the municipal authorities of Toulouse, together with his later publications in Lyon, caused the French Inquisition to monitor his activities closely. After several stays in prison, the combined efforts of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris, the Inquisition, and the theological faculty of the Sorbonne resulted in his conviction for heresy and a death sentence. He was hung and burned with his books on the Place Maubert in Paris. In modern times, Dolet is remembered as a martyr for what is now known as freedom of speech and freedom of the press. 

==Early life and education==
Born in 1509 to parents who are not known to modern historians, Dolet lived in Orléans until the age of twelve. He was able to secure a very solid education because influential &quot;and perhaps wealthy patronage ... made provision for his education, mainly at Padua and Toulouse, with apparently few privations due to lack of means.&quot; Accordingly, in 1521, he left for Paris, where he studied Latin for five years with Nicolas Bérault, who also taught Gaspard II de Coligny. 

In 1526, following the humanist tradition of the time, he began a tour of European universities. First, he went to Padua to perfect his knowledge of Latin and especially of the Cicero&#x27; writings. He did this under the direction of his master and friend, Simon de Villanova. On the death of Villanova, Étienne Dolet served as secretary to Jean de Langeac, bishop of Limoges and French ambassador to the Republic of Venice. There he followed Battista Egnazio&#x27;s lessons on Cicero, who became for Dolet his “master of writing and often of thought”. He stayed in Venice for a year, leaving when Langeac&#x27;s ambassadorship came to an end. During this time, Dolet also found time to write Latin love poems to a Venetian woman named Elena.

He returned soon afterwards to Toulouse, where he studied law from 1532 to 1534.
==Prison stays and banishment==
During his stay in Toulouse, he was elected speaker of the &#x27;French Nation&#x27; and was recognised as a gifted orator. In October 1533, he delivered a violent indictment of the &quot;backwardness and hostility to humanism and classical scholarship&quot; of the city of Toulouse, going so far as to describe it barbarism. Later, in January 1534, he delivered a diatribe on religious superstitions and the brutality of the Gascons. He was imprisoned in March 1534 and, despite the protection of Jean de Pins (a prominent humanist and bishop), he was banished by the Parliament of Toulouse in 1534.

In August 1534, following the banishment, he moved to Lyon, where he joined the circle of Lyon humanists and began the most fruitful part of his career. Its members included Clément Marot and Rabelais, as well as Guillaume and Maurice Scève, Jean de Tourne &quot;père&quot; and the printer Sébastien Gryphe, for whom he became a proofreader. In addition to these friends and close associates, Dolet also acquired in Lyon a number of sworn enemies who would &quot;follow him all the way to the pyre.&quot;

In 1535, thanks to Sébastien Gryphe, Dolet published his tract, the &quot;Dialogus de imitatione Ciceroniana&quot;, which revived the quarrel over Ciceronianism. In this work, he attacks both Erasmus and Luther, accusing them both of trying to destroy the Christian religion.

During a brawl that took place in December 1536, Dolet killed a painter, Henri Guillot, nicknamed Compaing. Dolet claimed that Guillot wanted to assassinate him. He fled to Paris to beg for mercy from the King, Francis I, to whom he presented a self-effacing poem describing the brawl. The King accorded him his protection and ordered him to return to Lyon. Dolet was nevertheless imprisoned for two months upon his return to Lyon.

== Royal privilege and printer in Lyon ==
On March 6, 1537, Francis I granted Dolet a highly advantageous privilege that gave him the exclusive right for ten years to print any work in Latin, Greek, Italian or French, whether from his pen or under his supervision. He allowed various publishers to benefit from this privilege before setting himself up as a printer in 1539. 

In 1538, he published the second of his two volumes of the &quot;Commentariorum linguae Latinae&quot;, an ambitious etymological dictionary of Latin (the first was published in 1536). This work, which he first conceived of when he was sixteen years old, is considered to be the &quot;magnum opus&quot; of his life. 

Also in 1538, Dolet married and, the following year, he had a son.

In 1541, he published &quot;De officio legati&quot; on the functions of ambassadors. This work is thought to be earliest printed work on the subject of ambassadorial responsibilities, with Dolet drawing on his experience working as part of Langeac&#x27;s embassy in Venice. However, it regarded mainly as an historical marker and is not considered to be influential in advancing thought on the law of international diplomacy.
With the financial assistance of Hellouin Dulin, Dolet opened a print shop on the &quot;rue Mercière&quot; in Lyon. Over the period 1538 to 1544, Dolet published some 84 works including textbooks for students, classic texts in French or Latin, and the literature of the time, Clément Marot, Rabelais (indeed, Dolet published a counterfeit edition of Gargantua which led to the falling out of the two men ). 

One of his popular publishing successes was his work on &#x27;How to Translate Well.&#x27; In this publication and more generally, Dolet promoted the use of vernacular French. This was part of a growing movement to make books more available to the educated, general public.

A quarter of this production is devoted to religious works. Notably, he published a vernacular French version of the New Testament and &#x27;The Institution of the Christian Religion&#x27; by John Calvin, a Protestant tract published during the Inquisition. He is not unaware of the dangers to which this sort of publication exposed him. Even works that he viewed as being within Catholic orthodoxy caused trouble with the Catholic authorities. His &quot;Cato Christianus&quot; is a catechism based on the model of the &quot;Disticha Catonis&quot; (Cato&#x27;s Couplets), a popular textbook for teaching Latin in the 16th century. The &quot;Cato Christianus&quot; was not only banned as soon as it was released, it was also condemned on October 2, 1542 and burned on the square in front of Notre-Dame de Paris in February 1544.

== Inquisition and trial ==

Dolet&#x27;s publication of religious works attracted the attention of the inquisitor Matthew Ory in 1542. In August of that year, he was incarcerated in the prisons of Lyon, accused of being the author of pernicious works and of not believing in the immortality of the soul. Convicted of having printed certain of these pernicious works, eating meat during Lent and claiming to prefer the sermon to the mass, he appealed to the Parliament of Paris, which had him transferred from the prisons of Roanne to the Conciergerie where he remained for 15 months. He obtained a new pardon thanks to the intervention of the Bishop of Tulle, Pierre Duchâtel and returned to Lyon.

He was imprisoned a second time in 1544, after the discovery of bundles of heretical books bearing his printer&#x27;s mark. However, he managed to escape and took refuge in Piedmont, Italy. He imprudently returned to France because he thought he could print letters in Lyon to appeal to the justice of the King of France, the Queen of Navarre and the Parliament of Paris. It was in these circumstances that he published the &#x27;Second Hell,&#x27; a collection of letters addressed to the powerful and intended to be a defense against his accusers. These letters were followed by two translations of Plato, the &quot;Axiochus&quot; and a translation of the &quot;Hipparchus&quot; (also apocryphal), subtitled “on lust and affection to gain”.

His third trial examined the affair of the bundles of heretical books. This trial may have been the result of a plot almost certainly organised by competing master printers from Lyon. The inquisitors focused on a passage of his translation of the &quot;Axochius&quot;: “After death, you will be nothing at all”. Dolet embellished his translation by adding the words “&quot;du tout&quot;” (at all). The theology faculty of the Sorbonne saw this as proof of Dolet&#x27;s heresy: he does not believe in the immortality of the soul. He was condemned to death as a heretic. 

== Execution ==
On August 3, 1546, Dolet made &#x27;amends&#x27; at the site of his torture by invoking the Virgin and her patron saint. In accordance with an act of mercy in his judgment, he was offered the possibility of being hanged, before being thrown with his books onto his pyre on Place Maubert in Paris. This Place was reserved for the printers&#x27; pyres during the Inquisition: four other printers were strangled there and then burned in 1546.

On his way to be first hung and then burnt, he was said to had composed the punning pentameter (Dolet himself does not suffer, but the pious crowd grieves). This reportedly elicited the following response from the priest who accompanied him: &quot;Non pia turba dolet sed Dolet ipse dolet&quot; (“it will be Dolet who will suffer and no one else”).

==Religious views==
Whether Dolet is to be classed with a representative of Protestantism or as an advocate of anti-Christian rationalism is a subject of debate. Protestants of his own time did not recognize him as one of them. Calvin condemned him, along with Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and his master Villanova, as having uttered blasphemies. The religious character of a large number of the books which he translated or published is sometimes cited in opposition to these charges, as is his advocacy of reading the Scriptures in the vernacular tongue.

Dolet has been referred to as an Anti-Trinitarian.

==Legacy==

From the eighteenth century onwards, Dolet has been remembered as a martyr to intolerance and as a symbol of free speech and freedom of the press. He has been commemorated by many monuments in France and has served as a rallying points for numerous political demonstrations. 

A first biography of Dolet’s life was published in 1779. An account of the Dolet’s trial for heresy was published (1836) by A.H. Taillandier from the registers of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris. 

A bronze statue of Dolet was erected in 1889 on the site of his execution on the Place Maubert in Paris. During the religious conflicts of the Third Republic, the statue became &quot;not only the virtual emblem of anticlerical freethinkers, but also served as a rallying point for Parisian militants, who paraded before his monument every year.&quot; The statue was removed and melted down in 1942 during the German occupation of Paris. Several attempts have been made to replace this monument, but so far none have been successful.

A street in the 20th arrondissement of Paris is named after Étienne Dolet. 
== Principal works ==

Many of Dolet&#x27;s books were destroyed as the products of heresy and books bearing his imprint are now extremely rare. His principal works are: 

* &quot;Orationes duæ in Tholosam. Eiusdem epistolarum libri II. Eiusdem carminum libri II. Ad eundem Epistolarum amicorum liber&quot; (1534)
* &quot;Dialogus de Imitatione Ciceroniana adversus Desiderium Erasmus Roterdamum pro Christophoro Longolio&quot;(1535), where he argues with Erasmus.

* &quot;De Re navali liber ad Lazarum Bayfium&quot; (1537)
* &quot;Carminum libri quatuor&quot;. Collection of 195 selected works. Banned in Lyon for its use of the term, fatum, in its full philosophical sense (1538).

<text>The time value of money refers to the fact that there is normally a greater benefit to receiving a sum of money now rather than an identical sum later. It may be seen as an implication of the later-developed concept of time preference.

The time value of money refers to the observation that it is better to receive money sooner than later. Money you have today can be invested to earn a positive rate of return, producing more money tomorrow. Therefore, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future.

The time value of money is among the factors considered when weighing the opportunity costs of spending rather than saving or investing money. As such, it is among the reasons why interest is paid or earned: interest, whether it is on a bank deposit or debt, compensates the depositor or lender for the loss of their use of their money. Investors are willing to forgo spending their money now only if they expect a favorable net return on their investment in the future, such that the increased value to be available later is sufficiently high to offset both the preference to spending money now and inflation (if present); see required rate of return.

==History==
The Talmud (~500 CE) recognizes the time value of money. In Tractate Makkos page 3a the Talmud discusses a case where witnesses falsely claimed that the term of a loan was 30 days when it was actually 10 years. The false witnesses must pay the difference of the value of the loan &quot;in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) thirty days..., and that same sum in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) 10 years...The difference is the sum that the testimony of the (false) witnesses sought to have the borrower lose; therefore, it is the sum that they must pay.&quot;

The notion was later described by Martín de Azpilcueta (1491–1586) of the School of Salamanca.

==Calculations==
Time value of money problems involve the net value of cash flows at different points in time.

In a typical case, the variables might be: a balance (the real or nominal value of a debt or a financial asset in terms of monetary units), a periodic rate of interest, the number of periods, and a series of cash flows. (In the case of a debt, cash flows are payments against principal and interest; in the case of a financial asset, these are contributions to or withdrawals from the balance.) More generally, the cash flows may not be periodic but may be specified individually. Any of these variables may be the independent variable (the sought-for answer) in a given problem. For example, one may know that: the interest is 0.5% per period (per month, say); the number of periods is 60 (months); the initial balance (of the debt, in this case) is 25,000 units; and the final balance is 0 units. The unknown variable may be the monthly payment that the borrower must pay.

For example, £100 invested for one year, earning 5% interest, will be worth £105 after one year; therefore, £100 paid now &quot;and&quot; £105 paid exactly one year later &quot;both&quot; have the same value to a recipient who expects 5% interest assuming that inflation would be zero percent. That is, £100 invested for one year at 5% interest has a &quot;future value&quot; of £105 under the assumption that inflation would be zero percent.

This principle allows for the valuation of a likely stream of income in the future, in such a way that annual incomes are discounted and then added together, thus providing a lump-sum &quot;present value&quot; of the entire income stream; all of the standard calculations for time value of money derive from the most basic algebraic expression for the present value of a future sum, &quot;discounted&quot; to the present by an amount equal to the time value of money. For example, the future value sum formula_1 to be received in one year is discounted at the rate of interest formula_2 to give the present value sum 
: formula_3

Some standard calculations based on the time value of money are:

* &quot;Present value&quot;: The current worth of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows, given a specified rate of return. Future cash flows are &quot;discounted&quot; at the &quot;discount rate;&quot; the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the future cash flows. Determining the appropriate discount rate is the key to valuing future cash flows properly, whether they be earnings or obligations.
* &quot;Present value of an annuity&quot;: An annuity is a series of equal payments or receipts that occur at evenly spaced intervals. Leases and rental payments are examples. The payments or receipts occur at the end of each period for an ordinary annuity while they occur at the beginning of each period for an annuity due.
:&quot;Present value of a perpetuity&quot; is an infinite and constant stream of identical cash flows.

* &quot;Future value&quot;: The value of an asset or cash at a specified date in the future, based on the value of that asset in the present.
* &quot;Future value of an annuity (FVA)&quot;: The future value of a stream of payments (annuity), assuming the payments are invested at a given rate of interest.

There are several basic equations that represent the equalities listed above. The solutions may be found using (in most cases) the formulas, a financial calculator, or a spreadsheet. The formulas are programmed into most financial calculators and several spreadsheet functions (such as PV, FV, RATE, NPER, and PMT).

For any of the equations below, the formula may also be rearranged to determine one of the other unknowns. In the case of the standard annuity formula, there is no closed-form algebraic solution for the interest rate (although financial calculators and spreadsheet programs can readily determine solutions through rapid trial and error algorithms).

These equations are frequently combined for particular uses. For example, bonds can be readily priced using these equations. A typical coupon bond is composed of two types of payments: a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a lump-sum return of capital at the end of the bond&#x27;s maturity—that is, a future payment. The two formulas can be combined to determine the present value of the bond.

An important note is that the interest rate &quot;i&quot; is the interest rate for the relevant period. For an annuity that makes one payment per year, &quot;i&quot; will be the annual interest rate. For an income or payment stream with a different payment schedule, the interest rate must be converted into the relevant periodic interest rate. For example, a monthly rate for a mortgage with monthly payments requires that the interest rate be divided by 12 (see the example below). See compound interest for details on converting between different periodic interest rates.

The rate of return in the calculations can be either the variable solved for, or a predefined variable that measures a discount rate, interest, inflation, rate of return, cost of equity, cost of debt or any number of other analogous concepts. The choice of the appropriate rate is critical to the exercise, and the use of an incorrect discount rate will make the results meaningless.

For calculations involving annuities, it must be decided whether the payments are made at the end of each period (known as an ordinary annuity), or at the beginning of each period (known as an annuity due). When using a financial calculator or a spreadsheet, it can usually be set for either calculation. The following formulas are for an ordinary annuity. For the answer to the present value of an annuity due, the PV of an ordinary annuity can be multiplied by (1 + &quot;i&quot;).

==Formula==
The following formula use these common variables:
* &quot;PV&quot; is the value at time zero (present value)
* &quot;FV&quot; is the value at time &quot;n&quot; (future value)
* &quot;A&quot; is the value of the individual payments in each compounding period
* &quot;n&quot; is the number of periods (not necessarily an integer)
* &quot;i&quot; is the interest rate at which the amount compounds each period
* &quot;g&quot; is the growing rate of payments over each time period

===Future value of a present sum===
The future value (&quot;FV&quot;) formula is similar and uses the same variables.
:formula_4

===Present value of a future sum===
The present value formula is the core formula for the time value of money; each of the other formulas is derived from this formula. For example, the annuity formula is the sum of a series of present value calculations.

The present value (&quot;PV&quot;) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:
:formula_5

The cumulative present value of future cash flows can be calculated by summing the contributions of &quot;FVt&quot;, the value of cash flow at time &quot;t&quot;:
:formula_6

Note that this series can be summed for a given value of &quot;n&quot;, or when &quot;n&quot; is ∞. This is a very general formula, which leads to several important special cases given below.

===Present value of an annuity for n payment periods===
In this case the cash flow values remain the same throughout the &quot;n&quot; periods. The present value of an annuity (PVA) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:
:formula_7

To get the PV of an annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + &quot;i&quot;).

===Present value of a growing annuity===
In this case, each cash flow grows by a factor of (1 + &quot;g&quot;). Similar to the formula for an annuity, the present value of a growing annuity (PVGA) uses the same variables with the addition of &quot;g&quot; as the rate of growth of the annuity (A is the annuity payment in the first period). This is a calculation that is rarely provided for on financial calculators.

Where &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;g&quot; :
:formula_8
Where &quot;i&quot; = &quot;g&quot; :
:formula_9

To get the PV of a growing annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + &quot;i&quot;).

===Present value of a perpetuity===
A perpetuity is payments of a set amount of money that occur on a routine basis and continue forever. When &quot;n&quot; → ∞, the &quot;PV&quot; of a perpetuity (a perpetual annuity) formula becomes a simple division.
:formula_10

===Present value of a growing perpetuity===
When the perpetual annuity payment grows at a fixed rate (&quot;g&quot;, with &quot;g&quot; &lt; &quot;i&quot;) the value is determined according to the following formula, obtained by setting &quot;n&quot; to infinity in the earlier formula for a growing perpetuity:

:formula_11

In practice, there are few securities with precise characteristics, and the application of this valuation approach is subject to various qualifications and modifications. Most importantly, it is rare to find a growing perpetual annuity with fixed rates of growth and true perpetual cash flow generation. Despite these qualifications, the general approach may be used in valuations of real estate, equities, and other assets.

This is the well known Gordon growth model used for stock valuation.

===Future value of an annuity===
The future value (after &quot;n&quot; periods) of an annuity (FVA) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:
:formula_12

To get the FV of an annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + &quot;i&quot;).

===Future value of a growing annuity===
The future value (after &quot;n&quot; periods) of a growing annuity (FVA) formula has five variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:

Where i ≠ g :
:formula_13
Where i = g :
:formula_14

===Formula table===
The following table summarizes the different formulas commonly used in calculating the time value of money. These values are often displayed in tables where the interest rate and time are specified.
Notes:
*&quot;A&quot; is a fixed payment amount, every period
*&quot;G&quot; is the initial payment amount of an increasing payment amount, that starts at &quot;G&quot; and increases by &quot;G&quot; for each subsequent period.
*&quot;D&quot; is the initial payment amount of an exponentially (geometrically) increasing payment amount, that starts at &quot;D&quot; and increases by a factor of (1 + &quot;g&quot;) each subsequent period.

==Derivations==

===Annuity derivation===
The formula for the present value of a regular stream of future payments (an annuity) is derived from a sum of the formula for future value of a single future payment, as below, where &quot;C&quot; is the payment amount and &quot;n&quot; the period.

A single payment &quot;C&quot; at future time &quot;m&quot; has the following future value at future time &quot;n&quot;:

:formula_15

Summing over all payments from time 1 to time &quot;n&quot;, then reversing the order of terms and substituting &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot; − &quot;m&quot;:

:formula_16

Note that this is a geometric series, with the initial value being &quot;a&quot; = &quot;C&quot;, the multiplicative factor being 1 + &quot;i&quot;, with &quot;n&quot; terms. Applying the formula for geometric series, we get:

:formula_17

The present value of the annuity (PVA) is obtained by simply dividing by formula_18:

:formula_19

Another simple and intuitive way to derive the future value of an annuity is to consider an endowment, whose interest is paid as the annuity, and whose principal remains constant. The principal of this hypothetical endowment can be computed as that whose interest equals the annuity payment amount:

:formula_20
:formula_21

Note that no money enters or leaves the combined system of endowment principal + accumulated annuity payments, and thus the future value of this system can be computed simply via the future value formula:
:formula_22

Initially, before any payments, the present value of the system is just the endowment principal, formula_23. At the end, the future value is the endowment principal (which is the same) plus the future value of the total annuity payments (formula_24). Plugging this back into the equation:
:formula_25
:formula_26

===Perpetuity derivation===
Without showing the formal derivation here, the perpetuity formula is derived from the annuity formula. Specifically, the term:
:formula_27
can be seen to approach the value of 1 as &quot;n&quot; grows larger. At infinity, it is equal to 1, leaving formula_28 as the only term remaining.

==Continuous compounding==
Rates are sometimes converted into the continuous compound interest rate equivalent because the continuous equivalent is more convenient (for example, more easily differentiated). Each of the formulas above may be restated in their continuous equivalents. For example, the present value at time 0 of a future payment at time t can be restated in the following way, where e is the base of the natural logarithm and r is the continuously compounded rate:
:formula_29
This can be generalized to discount rates that vary over time: instead of a constant discount rate &quot;r,&quot; one uses a function of time &quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). In that case, the discount factor, and thus the present value, of a cash flow at time &quot;T&quot; is given by the integral of the continuously compounded rate &quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;):
:formula_30
Indeed, a key reason for using continuous compounding is to simplify the analysis of varying discount rates and to allow one to use the tools of calculus. Further, for interest accrued and capitalized overnight (hence compounded daily), continuous compounding is a close approximation for the actual daily compounding. More sophisticated analysis includes the use of differential equations, as detailed below.

===Examples===
Using continuous compounding yields the following formulas for various instruments:
;Annuity:
:formula_31
;Perpetuity:
:formula_32
;Growing annuity:
:formula_33
;Growing perpetuity:
:formula_34
;Annuity with continuous payments:
:formula_35
These formulas assume that payment A is made in the first payment period and annuity ends at time &quot;t&quot;.

==Differential equations==
Ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs)—equations involving derivatives and one (respectively, multiple) variables—are ubiquitous in more advanced treatments of financial mathematics. While time value of money can be understood without using the framework of differential equations, the added sophistication sheds additional light on time value, and provides a simple introduction before considering more complicated and less familiar situations. This exposition follows .

The fundamental change that the differential equation perspective brings is that, rather than computing a &quot;number&quot; (the present value &quot;now&quot;), one computes a &quot;function&quot; (the present value now or at any point in &quot;future&quot;). This function may then be analyzed &quot;(how does its value change over time?)&quot; or compared with other functions.

Formally, the statement that &quot;value decreases over time&quot; is given by defining the linear differential operator formula_36 as:
:formula_37
This states that value decreases (−) over time (∂&quot;t&quot;) at the discount rate (&quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)). Applied to a function, it yields:
:formula_38
For an instrument whose payment stream is described by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), the value &quot;V&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) satisfies the inhomogeneous first-order ODE formula_39 (&quot;inhomogeneous&quot; is because one has &quot;f&quot; rather than 0, and &quot;first-order&quot; is because one has first derivatives but no higher derivatives)—this encodes the fact that when any cash flow occurs, the value of the instrument changes by the value of the cash flow (if one receives a £10 coupon, the remaining value decreases by exactly £10).

The standard technique tool in the analysis of ODEs is Green&#x27;s functions, from which other solutions can be built. In terms of time value of money, the Green&#x27;s function (for the time value ODE) is the value of a bond paying £1 at a single point in time &quot;u&quot;; the value of any other stream of cash flows can then be obtained by taking combinations of this basic cash flow. In mathematical terms, this instantaneous cash flow is modeled as a Dirac delta function formula_40

The Green&#x27;s function for the value at time &quot;t&quot; of a £1 cash flow at time &quot;u&quot; is
:formula_41
where &quot;H&quot; is the Heaviside step function. The notation &quot;formula_42&quot; is to emphasize that &quot;u&quot; is a &quot;parameter&quot; (fixed in any instance—the time when the cash flow will occur), while &quot;t&quot; is a &quot;variable&quot; (time). In other words, future cash flows are exponentially discounted (exp) by the sum (integral, formula_43) of the future discount rates (formula_44 for future, &quot;r&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) for discount rates), while past cash flows are worth 0 (formula_45), because they have already occurred. Note that the value &quot;at&quot; the moment of a cash flow is not well-defined—there is a discontinuity at that point, and one can use a convention (assume cash flows have already occurred, or not already occurred), or simply not define the value at that point.

In case the discount rate is constant, formula_46 this simplifies to
:formula_47
where formula_48 is &quot;time remaining until cash flow&quot;.

Thus for a stream of cash flows &quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) ending by time &quot;T&quot; (which can be set to formula_49 for no time horizon) the value at time &quot;t,&quot; formula_50 is given by combining the values of these individual cash flows:
:formula_51
This formalizes time value of money to future values of cash flows with varying discount rates, and is the basis of many formulas in financial mathematics, such as the Black–Scholes formula with varying interest rates.

<text>Platanus ( ) is a genus consisting of a small number of tree species native to the Northern Hemisphere. They are the sole living members of the family Platanaceae.

All mature members of &quot;Platanus&quot; are tall, reaching in height. The type species of the genus is the Oriental plane &quot;Platanus orientalis&quot;. All except for &quot;P. kerrii&quot; are deciduous, and most are found in riparian or other wetland habitats in the wild, though proving drought-tolerant in cultivation. The hybrid London plane (&quot;Platanus × hispanica&quot;) has proved particularly tolerant of urban conditions, and has been widely planted in London and elsewhere across the temperate world.

They are often known in English as planes or plane trees. A formerly used name that is now rare is plantain tree (not to be confused with other, unrelated, species with the name). Some North American species are called sycamores (especially &quot;Platanus occidentalis&quot;), although the term is also used for several unrelated species of trees. The genus name &quot;Platanus&quot; comes from Ancient Greek , which referred to &quot;Platanus orientalis&quot;.

==Botany==
The flowers are reduced and are borne in balls (globose heads); 3–7 hairy sepals may be fused at the base, and the petals are 3–7 and are spatulate. Male and female flowers are separate, but borne on the same plant (monoecious). The number of heads in one cluster (inflorescence) is indicative of the species (see table below). The male flower has 3–8 stamens; the female has a superior ovary with 3–7 carpels. Plane trees are wind-pollinated. Male flower-heads fall off after shedding their pollen.

After being pollinated, the female flowers become achenes that form an aggregate ball. The fruit is a multiple of achenes (plant systematics, Simpson M. G., 2006). Typically, the core of the ball is 1 cm in diameter and is covered with a net of mesh 1 mm, which can be peeled off. The ball is 2.5–4 cm in diameter and contains several hundred achenes, each of which has a single seed and is conical, with the point attached downward to the net at the surface of the ball. There is also a tuft of many thin stiff yellow-green bristle fibers attached to the base of each achene. These bristles help in wind dispersion of the fruits as in the dandelion.

The leaves are simple and alternate. In the subgenus &quot;Platanus&quot; they have a palmate outline. The base of the leaf stalk (petiole) is enlarged and completely wraps around the young stem bud in its axil. The axillary bud is exposed only after the leaf falls off.

The mature bark peels off or exfoliates easily in irregularly shaped patches, producing a mottled, scaly appearance. On old trunks, bark may not flake off, but thickens and cracks instead.

==Phylogeny==
There are two subgenera, subgenus &quot;Castaneophyllum&quot; containing the anomalous &quot;P. kerrii&quot;, and subgenus &quot;Platanus&quot;, with all the others; recent studies in Mexico have increased the number of accepted species in this subgenus. Within subgenus &quot;Platanus&quot;, evidence from both chloroplast and nuclear gene sequences suggests that the &quot;P. racemosa&quot; species complex in Western North America (including &quot;P. racemosa, P. gentryi, P. wrightii&quot;) is more closely related to the Eurasian &quot;P. orientalis&quot; than it is to the other North American species (&quot;P. mexicana&quot; sensu lato, including up to four species: &quot;P. chiapaensis, P. lindeniana, P. [×] mexicana&quot; sensu stricto, &quot;P. oaxacana; P. occidentalis&quot; s.l. with two [sub]species: &quot;P. occidentalis, P. palmeri&quot;; &quot;P. rzedowskii&quot;). The two groups form genetically and morphologically distinct evolutionary lineages (sister clades), informally called the “ANA clade” (Atlantic North American lineage) and “PNA-E clade” (Pacific North American-European lineage). Both lineages have been affected by reticulate evolutionary processes in the past (ancient or recent hybridization and introgression):
* &quot;Platanus palmeri&quot; (= &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; var. &quot;palmeri&quot;) – forming the southwesternmost populations of &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; s.l. – carries nuclear intron sequences (second intron of the Leafy gene) of PNA-E origin. It lacks the plastid haplotype specific for the northeastern populations (&quot;P. occidentalis&quot; s.str.)
* The internal transcribed spacers of the nuclear-encoded rRNA genes of &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; s.l. and &quot;P. rzedowskii&quot; include ANA-specific variants with functional 5.8S rDNA as well as PNA-E-specific variants showing signs of pseudogeny. The latter are shared with &quot;P. gentryi&quot;, the PNA-E species closest to the ANA clade area and the northern/ interior populations of &quot;P. mexicana&quot; s.l. This indicates that already the common ancestor of &quot;P. rzedowskii&quot; and &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; s.l. had been in contact with a member of the PNA-E clade.
* Likewise, &quot;P. rzedowskii&quot; from Nuevo León is a genetic mosaic, and may have originated from earlier hybridization within the ANA clade, between southernmost &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; s.l. (&quot;P. palmeri&quot;) and &quot;P. mexicana&quot; s.l., or their ancestors. Today the ranges of &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; s.l. and &quot;P. mexicana&quot; s.l. are mutually exclusive. &quot;Platanus rzedowskii&quot; is geographically and morphologically intermediate between &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; s.l. and &quot;P. mexicana&quot; s.l.
* Morphological reinvestigation including the originally collected material revealed that the interior populations of &quot;P. mexicana&quot; (northern Querétaro and northern Hidalgo; &quot;P. mexicana&quot; var. &quot;interior&quot; according Nixon &amp; Poole) mark the hybrid zone between &quot;P. rzedowskii&quot; and &quot;P. mexicana&quot; s.l. and the (former) contact zone to the species of the PNA-E clade (&quot;P. gentryi&quot;, &quot;P. wrightii&quot;). Since the holotype of &quot;P. mexicana&quot; is from this zone and shows the characteristical intermediate morphology, &quot;P. mexicana&quot; s.str. would represent a nothospecies: &quot;P. × mexicana&quot;. The remaining populations of &quot;P. mexicana&quot; s.l., &quot;P. lindeniana&quot;, show no sign of introgression from either &quot;P. rzedowskii, P. occidentalis-palmeri&quot; or the Western North American species (&quot;P. racemosa&quot; species aggregate), with the exception of one heterozygotic &quot;P. oaxacana&quot; population from northcentral Oaxaca.
The genus &quot;Platanus&quot; exemplarily illustrates the concept of a Coral of Life, a species network. Its modern-day species are not only the product of evolutionary dichotomies (cladogenesis), the splitting of an ancestral lineage into two (Tree of Life metaphor) but also evolutionary anastomoses: hybridization and introgression.

The fossil record of leaves and fruit identifiable to &quot;Platanus&quot; begins in the Paleocene. Despite the geographic separation between North America and Old World, species from these continents will cross readily resulting in fertile hybrids such as the London plane, which is an anthropogenic hybrid (cultivar) between the North American &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; sensu stricto (ANA clade) and the Mediterranean &quot;P. orientalis&quot; (PNA-E clade). Widely used as a park tree across the Northern Hemisphere, it frequently backcrosses with both its parents.

==Species==
The following are named species of &quot;Platanus&quot;; not all are accepted by all authorities:
==Diseases==

Planes are susceptible to plane anthracnose (&quot;Apiognomonia veneta&quot;), a fungal disease that can defoliate the trees in some years. The most severe infections are associated with cold, wet spring weather. &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; and the other American species are the most susceptible, with &quot;P. orientalis&quot; the most resistant. The hybrid London plane is intermediate in resistance.

&quot;Ceratocystis platani&quot;, a wilt disease, has become a significant problem in recent years in much of Europe. The North American species are mostly resistant to the disease, with which they probably coevolved, while the Old World species are highly sensitive.

Other diseases such as powdery mildew occur frequently, but are of lesser importance.

&quot;Platanus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Phyllonorycter platani&quot; and Setaceous Hebrew Character.

In the 21st century a disease, commonly known as Massaria disease, has attacked plane trees across Europe. It is caused by the fungus &quot;Splanchnonema platani&quot;, and causes large lesions on the upper sides of branches.

==Effects on humans==

There have been cases of &quot;platanus cough&quot;, symptoms of shortness of breath, coughing, and irritated eyes, which may affect several people in a place, and have led to initial suspicion of an attack with an irritant gas. After one such mass attack which affected schoolchildren in classrooms with open windows densely surrounded by plane tees, children had to be admitted to hospital, where they were treated and recovered without ill effects. It was found that the symptoms were due to the fine star-shaped trichomes (hairs) on all parts of platanus trees, which are broken off by strong wind after a prolonged dry period. The dust created causes direct irritation and scratchiness in the eyes, throat, and nose, but not the runny nose and itching eyes and nose caused by an allergy. The school incident took place after a dry period, with a fairly high temperature of , and wind blowing at .

Protection against platanus cough is provided by avoiding contact and wearing protective glasses and masks under weather conditions promoting release of trichomes. When cleaning in an urban environment, sweeping up fallen leaves and branches can release hairs; cleaning by suction is preferred. It is not recommended that trees in cities be felled, as they are beneficial; in particular the platanus trichomes act as biofilters for air pollutants. Where there are urban concentrations presenting a risk, seasonal spraying of trees with a solution of apple pectin can prevent the star hair from breaking off.

==Uses==

The principal use of these trees is as ornamental trees, especially in urban areas and by roadsides. The London plane is particularly popular for this purpose. The American plane is cultivated sometimes for timber and investigations have been made into its use as a biomass crop. The oriental plane is widely used as an ornamental tree, and also has a number of minor medicinal uses.

==Cultural history==
Most significant aspects of cultural history apply to &quot;Platanus orientalis&quot; in the Old World. The tree is an important part of the literary scenery of Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Phaedrus&quot;. Because of Plato, the tree also played an important role in the scenery of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Oratore&quot;. The trees also provided the shade under which Aristotle and Plato&#x27;s famed philosophical schools were held. Handel&#x27;s opera &quot;Serse&quot; has a famous aria, &quot;Ombra mai fu&quot;, which the title character sings in praise of his favorite plane tree.

The plane tree has been a frequent motif featured in Classical Chinese poetry as an embodiment of sorrowful sentiments due to its autumnal shedding of leaves.

The legendary Dry Tree first recorded by Marco Polo was possibly a platanus. According to the legend, it marked the site of the battle between Alexander the Great and Darius III.

The German camouflage pattern &quot;Platanenmuster&quot; (&quot;plane tree pattern&quot;), designed in 1937–1942 by Johann Georg Otto Schick, was the first dotted camouflage pattern.

<text>The United States has 154 protected areas known as national forests, covering . National forests are managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first national forest was established as the Yellowstone Park Timber and Land Reserve on March 30, 1891, then in the Department of the Interior. In 1897, the Organic Act provided purposes for which forest reserves could be established, including to reserve a supply of timber, protect the forest from development, and secure water supplies. With the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, the president of the United States is given the power to set aside forest reserves in the public domain. With the Transfer Act of 1905, forest reserves became part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the newly created U.S. Forest Service.

By 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt had more than doubled the forest-reserve acreage, and Congress responded by limiting the president&#x27;s ability to proclaim new reserves. The National Forest System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new additions to the system under the authority of the Weeks Act. The management goals provided by the Organic Act were expanded upon by the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 to include &quot;outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes&quot; as well as for the establishment of wilderness areas.

As of September 30, 2014, the Forest Service manages a total of , of which are national forests. The additional land areas include 20 national grasslands, 59 purchase units, 19 research and experimental areas, five land utilization projects and 37 other areas. The National Forest System has an extensive and complicated history of reorganization, so while there are currently 154 named national forests, many of these are managed together as either a single forest or separate forests.

There is at least one national forest in all but ten states: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Dakota, and Rhode Island (although Kansas and North Dakota have national grasslands). In addition, Puerto Rico contains El Yunque National Forest, the only tropical U.S. rainforest. Alaska has the most national forest land, with , followed by California () and Idaho (). Idaho also has the greatest percent of its land in national forests, with 38.2 percent, followed by Oregon (24.7 percent) and Colorado (20.9 percent). On maps, national forests in the west generally show the true extent of their area, but those in the east often only show purchase districts, within which usually only a minority of the land is owned by the Forest Service.

== Notes ==
* Listed names of national forests represent the current management divisions of the National Forest System. Forests that are managed separately, such as Allegheny National Forest and Monongahela National Forest, are listed as separate forests. Forests that are managed together, however, may or may not be listed separately. Forests managed together and with hyphenated names, such as Salmon–Challis National Forest, are considered to be a single national forest. Forests that are managed together under titles such as Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests, are considered to be separate forests. National forests listed in this column in small text are constituent national forests managed by, but not included in the name of, the named national forest in normal text. To reach the figure of 154 national forests, count hyphenated names as two forests, with the exception of Manti–La Sal, which is the official name of one forest. Uinta–Wasatch–Cache is counted as three, and George Washington and Jefferson is counted as two.
* In the case of national forests in multiple states, the states are listed in descending order by land area of that forest contained in each state. States with the most area of that forest are listed first, while states with the least are listed last. Coordinates are those by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, and may not be representative of the entire forest.
* The history of the National Forest System is very complicated. Forests have been transferred between agencies, renamed, divided, consolidated, discontinued, established from parts of existing forests, had portions ceded to other forests, expanded from other lands, among various other actions. The date given represents the day: that forest was established as is, a predecessor forest with the same boundaries was established under a different name, or the earliest date of establishment of a forest that was combined in whole with another forest.
*Forests with citations to the three books in the &quot;This Land&quot; series by Robert H. Mohlenbrock can be found in the section of the cited book that corresponds to that forest. Additional information about a particular forest can be found in this series and at each forest&#x27;s website.
*The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) consists of of U.S. Forest Service land in the Lake Tahoe watershed. The LTBMU was formed from existing Forest Service land that was managed by Eldorado, Tahoe, and Humboldt–Toiyabe National Forests. Only of land in LTBMU is officially designated as LTBMU, and the remainder of the land is still officially designated as the three sources national forests. However, all of this land is managed separately as LTBMU, essentially making it a separate national forest.

<doc id="165264" wikidata="Q1791882" url="?curid=165264" title="Culture theory">
<text>Culture theory is the branch of comparative anthropology and semiotics that seeks to define the heuristic concept of culture in operational and/or scientific terms.

==Overview==
In the 19th century, &quot;culture&quot; was used by some to refer to a wide array of human activities, and by some others as a synonym for &quot;civilization&quot;. In the 20th century, anthropologists began theorizing about culture as an object of scientific analysis. Some used it to distinguish human adaptive strategies from the largely instinctive adaptive strategies of animals, including the adaptive strategies of other primates and non-human hominids, whereas others used it to refer to symbolic representations and expressions of human experience, with no direct adaptive value. Both groups understood culture as being definitive of human nature.

According to many theories that have gained wide acceptance among anthropologists, culture exhibits the way that humans interpret their biology and their environment. According to this point of view, culture becomes such an integral part of human existence that it &quot;is&quot; the human environment, and most cultural change can be attributed to human adaptation to historical events. Moreover, given that culture is seen as the primary adaptive mechanism of humans and takes place much faster than human biological evolution, most cultural change can be viewed as culture adapting to itself.

Although most anthropologists try to define culture in such a way that it separates human beings from other animals, many human traits are similar to those of other animals, particularly the traits of other primates. For example, chimpanzees have big brains, but human brains are bigger. Similarly, bonobos exhibit complex sexual behaviour, but human beings exhibit much more complex sexual behaviours. As such, anthropologists often debate whether human behaviour is different from animal behaviour in degree rather than in kind; they must also find ways to distinguish cultural behaviour from sociological behaviour and psychological behavior.

Acceleration and amplification of these various aspects of culture change have been explored by complexity economist, W. Brian Arthur. In his book, &quot;The Nature of Technology&quot;, Arthur attempts to articulate a theory of change that considers that existing technologies (or material culture) are combined in unique ways that lead to novel new technologies. Behind that novel combination is a purposeful effort arising in human motivation. This articulation would suggest that we are just beginning to understand what might be required for a more robust theory of culture and culture change, one that brings coherence across many disciplines and reflects an integrating elegance.

<doc id="165266" wikidata="Q178749" url="?curid=165266" title="Weighted average cost of capital">
<text>The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. The WACC is commonly referred to as the firm&#x27;s cost of capital. Importantly, it is dictated by the external market and not by management. The WACC represents the minimum return that a company must earn on an existing asset base to satisfy its creditors, owners, and other providers of capital, or they will invest elsewhere.

Companies raise money from a number of sources: common stock, preferred stock and related rights, straight debt, convertible debt, exchangeable debt, employee stock options, pension liabilities, executive stock options, governmental subsidies, and so on. Different securities, which represent different sources of finance, are expected to generate different returns. The WACC is calculated taking into account the relative weights of each component of the capital structure. The more complex the company&#x27;s capital structure, the more laborious it is to calculate the WACC.

Companies can use WACC to see if the investment projects available to them are worthwhile to undertake.

==Calculation==
In general, the WACC can be calculated with the following formula:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the number of sources of capital (securities, types of liabilities); formula_3 is the required rate of return for security formula_4; and formula_5 is the market value of all outstanding securities formula_4.

In the case where the company is financed with only equity and debt, the average cost of capital is computed as follows:

formula_7

where formula_8 is the total debt, formula_9 is the total shareholder&#x27;s equity, formula_10 is the cost of debt, and formula_11 is the cost of equity. The market values of debt and equity should be used when computing the weights in the WACC formula.

===Tax effects===
Tax effects can be incorporated into this formula. For example, the WACC for a company financed by one type of shares with the total market value of formula_12 and cost of equity formula_13 and one type of bonds with the total market value of formula_14 and cost of debt formula_15, in a country with corporate tax rate formula_16, is calculated as:

formula_17

This calculation can vary significantly due to the existence of many plausible proxies for each element. As a result, a fairly wide range of values for the WACC of a given firm in a given year may appear defensible.

==Components==

===Debt===
&quot;The firm&#x27;s debt component is stated as kd&quot; and since there is a tax benefit from interest payments then the after tax WACC component is kd(1-T); where T is the tax rate.

Increasing the debt component under WACC has advantages including:
no loss of control (voting rights) that would come from other sources,
upper limit is placed on share of profits,
flotation costs are typically lower than equity, and
interest expense is tax deductible.
But there are also disadvantages of the debt component including:
Using WACC makes the firm legally obliged to make payments no matter how tight the funds on hand are,
in the case of bonds full face value comes due at one time, and
taking on more debt = taking on more financial risk (more systematic risk) requiring higher cash flows.

===Equity===
Weighted average cost of capital equation:
WACC= (Wd)[(Kd)(1-t)]+ (Wpf)(Kpf)+ (Wce)(Kce)

Cost of new equity should be the adjusted cost for any underwriting fees termed flotation costs (F):
Ke = D1/P0(1-F) + g; where F = flotation costs, D1 is dividends, P0 is price of the stock, and g is the growth rate.

There are 3 ways of calculating Ke:
#Capital Asset Pricing Model
#Dividend Discount Method
#Bond Yield Plus Risk Premium Approach

The equity component has advantages for the firm including:
no legal obligation to pay (depends on class of shares) as opposed to debt,
no maturity (unlike e.g. bonds),
lower financial risk, and
it could be cheaper than debt with good prospects of profitability.
But also disadvantages including:
new equity dilutes current ownership share of profits and voting rights (impacting control),
cost of underwriting for equity is much higher than for debt,
too much equity = target for a leveraged buy-out by another firm, and
no tax shield, dividends are not tax deductible, and may exhibit double taxation.

==Marginal cost of capital schedule==
Marginal cost of capital (MCC) schedule or an investment opportunity curve is a graph that relates the firm&#x27;s weighted cost of each unit of capital to the total amount of new capital raised. The first step in preparing the MCC schedule is to rank the projects using internal rate of return (IRR). The higher the IRR the better off a project is.

<text>Gillingham Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Gillingham, Kent, England that plays home matches at Priestfield Stadium. The team competes in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system, in the 2024–25 season.

The club was founded in 1893 as New Brompton Football Club and renamed to Gillingham Football Club in 1912. The club played in the Southern League before joining the Football League in 1920. After 18 unsuccessful seasons, Gillingham were voted out of the league in favour of Ipswich Town at the end of the 1937–38 season, and returned to the Southern League. The club was voted back into the Football League in 1950, when it was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs. Twice in the late 1980s Gillingham came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline then set in and in 1993 they narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference. Between 2000 and 2005, Gillingham were in the second tier of the English football league system for the only time in their history, achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in 2002–03.

The club originally played in black and white striped shirts but switched to blue shirts in the 1930s. The club crest has traditionally depicted the white horse symbol of the county of Kent. Priestfield Stadium has been the club&#x27;s home ground throughout its existence; it once held up to 30,000 fans but in the modern era the capacity is less than half that figure. The club has twice won the championship of English football&#x27;s fourth tier, in the 1963–64 and 2012–13 seasons, under managers Freddie Cox and Martin Allen respectively.

==History==
:

===Early years===

The local success of a junior football side, Chatham Excelsior F.C., encouraged a group of businessmen to meet with a view to creating a football club which could compete in larger competitions. New Brompton F.C. was formed at the meeting, held on 18 May 1893, New Brompton being a settlement adjacent to Gillingham. The founders also purchased the plot of land which later became Priestfield Stadium. The new club played its first match on 2 September 1893, losing 5–1 to Woolwich Arsenal&#x27;s reserve side in front of a crowd of 2,000. New Brompton were among the founder members of the Southern League upon its creation in 1894, and were placed in Division Two. They were named Champions in the first season (1894–95) going on to defeat Swindon Town in a test match to win promotion.

In the seasons that followed, the club struggled in Division One, finishing bottom in the 1907–08 season, avoiding relegation only due to expansion of the league. Whilst the club&#x27;s league performance was disappointing, the side did manage a famous cup victory over Football League First Division Sunderland and held Manchester City to a draw before losing in the replay. In 1912 the directors passed a resolution to change the club&#x27;s name to Gillingham F.C., and the team played under this name throughout the 1912–13 season, although the change was not officially ratified by the shareholders until the following year. The team finished bottom of Division One in the 1919–20 season but for a third time avoided relegation, due to the subsequent elevation of all Southern League Division One clubs to form the new Football League Division Three.

===First spell in the Football League===
In the first season of the newly created Football League Division Three, the 1920–21 season, Gillingham again finished bottom, and in the years to follow there was little improvement on this, the club continually finishing in the lower reaches of the bottom division. In 1938 the team finished bottom of the Third Division (South) and were required to apply for re-election for the fifth time since joining the league. This bid for re-election failed, with Gillingham returning to the Southern League and Ipswich Town being promoted in their place. Gillingham quickly established themselves as one of the stronger sides in the league, winning a local double of the Kent League and Kent Senior Cup in the 1945–46 season. In the 1946–47 season the team won both the Southern League Cup and the Southern League championship, during which they recorded a club record 12–1 victory over Gloucester City. The Gills also won the league title in 1948–49.

===Return to the Football League===
In 1950, plans were announced to expand the Football League Division Three (South) from 22 to 24 teams and, taking into account their local success in the interim, Gillingham were re-elected to the Football League with a landslide vote. The team spent eight seasons in Division Three (South) before the restructuring of the league system for the 1958–59 season saw them placed in the newly created Fourth Division. They remained in this division until 1964, when manager Freddie Cox led them to promotion, winning the first championship in the club&#x27;s history. The team finished the season level on 60 points with Carlisle United, but with a fractionally better goal average (1.967 against 1.948).

After relegation back to the Fourth Division in 1970–71, the Gills were soon promoted back to the Third Division in the 1973–74 season. After this the club seemed to find its level in Division Three, regularly mounting a challenge for promotion which ultimately fell short each time, coming particularly close to promotion in 1986–87 when they reached the play-offs only to lose in the final to Swindon Town. During this period the club produced future stars Steve Bruce and Tony Cascarino, who was famously bought from non-league Crockenhill in exchange for a set of tracksuits.
In 1987, the Gills hit the headlines when, on consecutive Saturdays, they beat Southend United 8–1 and Chesterfield 10–0, the latter a club record for a Football League match. Just a few months later, however, manager Keith Peacock was controversially sacked, and within 18 months the club had fallen into Division Four. The ensuing spell in the lower division brought little success, and in the 1992–93 Division Three campaign the Gills narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference.

===Recent highs and lows===

Beset with financial problems, the club went into administration in January 1995, and by the end of the 1994–95 season faced the threat of being expelled from the Football League and closed down. In June 1995, however, a London-based businessman, Paul Scally, stepped in and bought the club. He brought in new manager Tony Pulis, who led Gillingham to promotion in his first season, finishing second in the old Division Three (now Football League Two). In 1999 the Gills made the play-offs but lost in the final to Manchester City. The Gills were 2–0 up with less than two minutes left only to see City score twice, the equaliser in injury time, and go on to win 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out. Soon after the play-off loss, Pulis was sacked for gross misconduct, and Peter Taylor appointed manager. In the 1999–00 season Gillingham qualified for the play-offs again, where they faced Wigan Athletic in the final at Wembley Stadium. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes, but, thanks to goals in extra time from substitutes Steve Butler and Andy Thomson, the Gills won 3–2 and were promoted to Division One for the first time.

Taylor then left to manage Leicester City, and Andy Hessenthaler was appointed as player-manager. He led the club to their best ever league finish of eleventh in the 2002–03 season, but the following season saw the club narrowly avoid relegation on goal difference. Hessenthaler resigned as manager in November 2004, and new boss Stan Ternent was unable to prevent the Gills&#x27; relegation to League One. At the end of the 2007–08 season the club was relegated again, this time to League Two, but an immediate return to the third level was secured via the play-offs after beating Shrewsbury Town in the final. In the 2009–10 season, however, the Gills slipped into the bottom four on the last day, and were relegated back to League Two, having failed to win a single away game in the league all season. This resulted in manager Mark Stimson having his contract terminated, and Andy Hessenthaler was appointed as manager of the club for the second time. At the start of the 2012–13 season Hessenthaler was replaced by Martin Allen, who led the club to promotion as League Two champions in his first season in charge. However, shortly after winning League Two, Allen was sacked in what many saw as a surprise after a poor start to the season. The club remained in League One from 2013 up until 2022, with a best finish of ninth, achieved in the 2015–16 season. In the 2021–22 season, Gillingham were relegated back into League Two. In December 2022, Florida-based property tycoon Brad Galinson acquired a majority shareholding in the club, with Scally retaining minority ownership. In January 2023 the club confirmed that Galinson would also take on the position of Chairman.

==Stadium==

The Gills have played at Priestfield Stadium throughout their existence. The ground was originally purchased by the founders of the club through an issue of 1,500 £1 shares. Sources differ on whether the ground was named after the road on which the land stood, Priestfield Road, or whether the road was named after the ground; if the latter is the case then the origin of the ground&#x27;s name is unknown. The ground was extensively developed prior to the 1930s, but there was then little change until the late 1990s and the arrival of Paul Scally as chairman. Three of the four stands were demolished and rebuilt between 1995 and 2000. The fourth stand, known as the Town End, was demolished to make way for a new stand, to be named the Brian Moore Stand after television sports commentator Brian Moore, who was a well-known Gills fan, but the club&#x27;s financial situation has not allowed the new stand to be built. A temporary stand was erected in 2003 and remains in place as of 2024. From 2007 until 2010 the stadium was officially named KRBS Priestfield Stadium as part of a sponsorship deal with the Kent Reliance Building Society. In 2011 it was rebranded again, this time, to MEMS Priestfield Stadium under another such agreement.

At its peak in the 1940s the official capacity of the stadium was listed as &quot;between 25,000 and 30,000&quot; but subsequent redevelopments, the removal of terraces and building of new facilities have seen this reduced to a current capacity of 11,582. In the 2018–19 season, the most recent to be completed in full with full crowd capacity permitted, the average attendance at home matches was 5,128. The ground has also hosted home fixtures of the England women&#x27;s national football team. The club&#x27;s training ground is Beechings Cross, in Grange Road, Gillingham. In 2012 the club was involved in a dispute with the local council, who alleged that Gillingham owed over £30,000 in unpaid bills relating to the training facility.

==Colours and crest==

Although Gillingham have long been associated with the colours blue and white, the original New Brompton side wore a strip consisting of black and white striped shirts with black shorts. In 1913 the black and white strip was dropped in favour of red shirts with blue sleeves, emblazoned with the borough&#x27;s coat of arms. The striped shirts returned after World War One, before finally being replaced with the now-familiar combination of plain blue shirts and white shorts in 1931. More recent years have seen several variations on the blue and white colour scheme. In the late 1990s the team wore blue and black striped shirts, recalling the original New Brompton stripes. In the summer of 2003 it was controversially announced that the club&#x27;s first choice shirts for the following season would be predominantly white, rather than blue. The announcement received such a hostile response from supporters that the white strip was replaced by one featuring blue and black hoops, which had originally been earmarked as the team&#x27;s third choice kit. In March 2010 the club announced a return to the black and blue stripes for the 2010–11 season. In recognition of the centenary of the renaming of the club, the 2012–13 kit was red with blue sleeves and collar, and the club&#x27;s crest was replaced by the town&#x27;s crest. After winning the League Two title in 2012–13, the club gave season ticket holders the chance to vote on what colours the club would play in for the 2013–14 season, with the fans choosing to return to a blue and white kit. Blue and white, or blue with black stripes, have been used since.
The club&#x27;s current crest is a shield divided vertically into halves of black and white stripes and solid blue, reflecting the club&#x27;s original and modern kits. On the blue half is the county emblem of Kent, a white horse rampant, albeit slightly altered from its normal form as its mane is stylised into the letters of the word &quot;Gills&quot;. This side has been sometimes given a red or pink background, to coordinate with away kits featuring those colours. The club&#x27;s motto, which appears on a scroll below the crest, is &quot;Domus clamantium&quot;, the Latin for &quot;the home of the shouting men&quot;, a traditional epithet associated with the town of Gillingham. In keeping with the crest, the club&#x27;s mascot, Tommy Trewblu, takes the form of a horse. He first appeared at a match against Macclesfield Town in October 1998.

The first sponsor&#x27;s name to appear on Gillingham shirts was that of Italian home appliance manufacturers Zanussi, who sponsored the club in the mid-1980s. Subsequent sponsors have included Chatham Maritime, Medway Toyota, Cannon Tool Hire, Invicta FM, Kool, Medway News, SeaFrance, MHS Homes Group, Kent Reliance Building Society, Automatic Retailing, MEMS Power Generation, and Medway Council.

==Managers==
For the first three years of the club&#x27;s existence, team matters were handled by a committee. In 1897, William Ironside Groombridge, the club&#x27;s secretary, took sole charge of team affairs to become Gillingham&#x27;s first recognised manager. Former England international Stephen Smith was appointed as full-time manager in 1906, but left in 1908, with Groombridge once again taking on team responsibilities. Groombridge was associated with the club, as manager and secretary, for over 25 years. When the club was admitted to the Football League in 1920, Robert Brown was appointed as manager, but he resigned a month later before the season had even begun. His replacement, Scotsman John McMillan, thus became the first manager to take charge of the team in a Football League match.

In 1939, a year after the club was voted back out of the Football League, Archie Clark took over as manager, and was still in charge when the club was elected back to the Football League in 1950. Clark remained in the job until 1957. Freddie Cox took over in 1962 and led the club to the Football League Fourth Division championship in the 1963–64 season, making him the first manager to win a Football League divisional title with the club. Basil Hayward was sacked in 1971 after the club was relegated back to the Fourth Division in the 1970–71 season, but his successor Andy Nelson led the club to promotion back to Division Three three years later before controversially resigning.

Tony Pulis took over in 1995, with Gillingham once again in the bottom division, and managed the club to promotion in his first season in charge. Three years later he led the team to the Second Division play-off final, but was sacked immediately after this after being accused of gross misconduct. Peter Taylor replaced him and took the club to a second consecutive play-off final, where Gillingham gained promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time. In 2013 Martin Allen became the second manager to lead the Gills to a divisional title in the Football League, as the team won the championship of League Two.

==Statistics and records==
Goalkeeper Ron Hillyard holds the record for Gillingham appearances, having played 657 matches in all competitions between 1974 and 1990, while the record for appearances solely in the Football League is held by another goalkeeper, John Simpson, with 571 between 1957 and 1972. Brian Yeo is the club&#x27;s all-time leading league goalscorer, having scored a total of 136 goals between 1963 and 1975. He also jointly holds the club record for the most Football League goals scored in a single season, having scored 31 goals in the 1973–74 season, equalling the record set by Ernie Morgan in 1954–55. The highest number of goals scored by a player in a single game at a professional level is the six registered by Fred Cheesmur against Merthyr Town in April 1930. The highest transfer fee received by the club is £1.5 million for Robert Taylor, paid by Manchester City in 1999, and the highest fee paid by Gillingham is £600,000 for Carl Asaba, signed from Reading in 1998.

The club&#x27;s record home attendance is 23,002, for an FA Cup match against Queens Park Rangers on 10 January 1948, a record which will almost certainly never be broken unless the club relocates to a larger ground, given that Priestfield Stadium&#x27;s current capacity is approximately half that figure. The team&#x27;s biggest ever professional win was a 10–0 defeat of Chesterfield in September 1987,
although they had previously registered a 12–1 win against Gloucester City in the Southern League in November 1946. The Gills hold the record for the fewest goals conceded by a team in the course of a 46-game Football League season, set in the 1995–96 season, during which goalkeeper Jim Stannard kept 29 clean sheets.

==Rivalries==
The 2003 Football Fans Census revealed that no other team&#x27;s supporters considered Gillingham to be among their club&#x27;s main rivals. Millwall are considered to be the closest the Gills have to local rivals. Swindon Town are seen by many fans as the club&#x27;s biggest rivals, stemming from bad-tempered matches between the teams in the past. While Swindon fans generally do not consider Gillingham among their biggest rivals, there was violence when they met at Priestfield in the 2005–06 season, their first meeting since a promotion play-off match in 1987. Following their promotion in 1989, Maidstone United became Kent&#x27;s second League side. A rivalry with Gillingham developed over the following seasons, until Maidstone&#x27;s financial troubles forced them to resign from the League in 1992. A minor rivalry between Gillingham and Fulham has developed arising from the death of a Fulham fan who was killed during a clash between both sets of fans outside Priestfield Stadium in March 1998.

==In popular culture==
In 1956, comedian Fred Emney filmed a scene for his sitcom &quot;Emney Enterprises&quot; prior to the start of a match between Gillingham and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. The footage featured the overweight Emney, wearing a flat cap and monocle and smoking a cigar, dribbling the ball past the entire Gills defence and scoring a goal. The 2005 film &quot;Green Street&quot; makes use of action sequences filmed during a match between Gillingham and West Ham United, although the dialogue states that the team playing West Ham is Birmingham City to align with the narrative of the film. A film entitled &quot;The Shouting Men&quot;, released in March 2010, centres on a group of Gillingham fans and features scenes shot at Priestfield.

<doc id="165279" wikidata="Q205203" url="?curid=165279" title="European Committee of the Regions">
<text>The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) is the European Union&#x27;s (EU) assembly of local and regional representatives that provides sub-national authorities (i.e. regions, counties, provinces, municipalities and cities) with a direct voice within the EU&#x27;s institutional framework.

Established in 1994, the CoR was set up to address two main issues. First, about three quarters of EU legislation is implemented at local or regional level, so local and regional representatives needed to have a say in the development of new EU laws. Second, there were concerns about a widening gap between the public and the process of European integration; involving the elected level of government closest to the citizens was one way of closing the gap.

== History ==
Within the European Union, local and regional authorities have lobbied for an increased say in EU affairs. This resulted in the creation of the European Committee of the Regions by the Maastricht Treaty, and the provision for Member States to be represented in the Council of the EU by ministers from their regional governments.

== Principles ==
There are three main principles at the heart of the committee&#x27;s work:

; Subsidiarity
: This principle, enshrined into the Treaties at the same time as the creation of the CoR, means that decisions within the European Union should be taken at the closest practical level to the citizen. The European Union, therefore, should not take on tasks which are better suited to national, regional or local administrations.
; Proximity
: All levels of government should aim to be &#x27;close to the citizens&#x27;, in particular by organising their work in a transparent fashion, so people know who is in charge of what and how to make their views heard.
; Partnership
: Sound European governance means European, national, regional and local government working together – all four are indispensable and should be involved throughout a &quot;multi-level governance&quot; decision-making process.

==Scope==
The Treaties oblige the European Commission and the Council of the European Union to consult the Committee of the Regions whenever new proposals are made in areas that have repercussions at regional or local level. Outside these areas, the commission, Council and European Parliament have the option to consult the CoR on issues if they see important regional or local implications to a proposal. The CoR can also draw up an opinion on its own initiative, which enables it to put issues on the EU agenda.

The CoR has gained the right (semi-privileged status) to approach the European Court of Justice now that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force following ratification by all EU Member States (Article 8, Protocol (No. 2) on the Application of the Principles of Subsidiarity and Proportionality).

==Composition==
The CoR has 329 full members and the same number of alternate members. The number from each EU country reflects the size of its population, but ranges from a representation of an average of 88087 citizens of Malta per seat to 3.45 million citizens per German seat. Its members are locally and regionally elected representatives including mayors, regional presidents and councillors. The numbers per country are as follows:
== Internal structure ==

=== President ===
Elected for a two-and-a-half-year term at the plenary assembly, the President guides the committee&#x27;s work, chairs plenary sessions and is the CoR&#x27;s official representative.

==== List of presidents ====
=== First Vice-President ===
The First Vice-president is also elected by the plenary assembly for two-and-a-half years and represents the president in the latter&#x27;s absence. Vasco Alves Cordeiro (Portugal / Party of European Socialists, PES), Member of the Regional Parliament of Azores, was elected First Vice-president of the European Committee of the Regions on 12 February 2020. On 29 June 2022, he was replaced by Apostolos Tzitzikostas (Greece / European People&#x27;s Party, EPP), Governor of Central Macedonia Region.

=== Bureau ===
The Bureau is the executive body of the CoR. It comprises 61 members: the president, the First Vice-president, the presidents of the six political groups, one vice-president per member state (27), and 26 other members from the national delegations, enabling it to reflect national and political balances. The Bureau generally meets seven or eight times a year to draw up the CoR policy programme and instructs the administration on the implementation of its decisions.

=== Plenary assembly ===
The members of the CoR meet in plenary session in Brussels six times a year, to discuss and adopt opinions, reports and resolutions.

=== CoR commissions ===
The CoR structures its work by means of six thematic commissions, which specialise in topical areas:

* CIVEX: citizenship, governance, institutional and external affairs 
* COTER: territorial cohesion policy; 
* ECON: economic policy; 
* ENVE: environment, climate change and energy; 
* NAT: natural resources and agriculture; 
* SEDEC: social policy, employment, education, culture and research.

They prepare draft opinions and hold conferences and seminars focused on their areas of competence. Each commission has approximately 100 members (each member can be part of two commissions) and is supported by a secretariat within the administration. A special Commission for Financial and Administrative Affairs (CFAA) is also established to assist the CoR Bureau.

=== Political groups ===
The CoR has six political groups: the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (PES), the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), Renew Europe (RE), the European Alliance (EA), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group) and The Greens (GRE). The members of each political group meet before major meetings to adopt common positions, membership of the plenary body is as follows, with 15 seats currently vacant:

=== Conference of Presidents ===
The CoR president, first vice-president, presidents of the political groups and the secretary general gather within a Conference of Presidents before each plenary session and other important meetings, with the aim of reaching a political consensus on strategic questions.

=== National delegations ===
The CoR also comprises 27 national delegations. Members meet in their national delegations before plenary sessions and other events to discuss common positions.

=== Secretary-General ===
The Secretary-General is appointed for five years by the Bureau. As head of the CoR administration, the Secretary-General must not hold a political mandate. He is responsible for implementing President&#x27;s and Bureau decisions and the smooth running of the CoR administration. Petr Blížkovský is the CoRs&#x27; Secretary-General since 16 December 2019.

==== Secretariat-General ====
The Secretariat-General consists of five directorates: Members and Plenaries; Legislative Work 1; Legislative Work 2; Communication; Human Resources and Finance. The Logistics and Translations Directorates are jointly managed with the European Economic and Social Committee. The total number of CoR staff in 2015 was 527.

=== Budget ===
The CoR&#x27;s 2013 budget (€36.5M) represents 0.06% of the total EU budget which makes it the third smallest EU institution in terms of budgetary needs. Its 2014 budget (€90.2M) breakdown according to purpose of expenditure is as follows: 39.7% – Consultative Works (€35.8M); 30.3% – Translation, Interpretation and Print (€27.2M); 30% – Administration and Functioning (€27M). The CoR&#x27;s 2015 budget was €89.2M. Although all CoR expenditure formally falls under Heading 5 (Administrative expenditure) of the EU Budget, as is the case for the European Parliament budget, a substantial part of its budget relates to non-administrative expenditure. Most obvious examples are all CoR expenses related to its Members and their political activities.

== Work ==

=== Opinions ===
The European Commission, Council of Ministers and European Parliament consult the CoR when drawing up legislative texts (directives, regulations, etc.) on areas affecting local and regional authorities. The draft texts are forwarded to the relevant CoR commission. A rapporteur is then appointed to draw up the committee&#x27;s opinion. This draft opinion must be adopted by the CoR commission before being discussed at the plenary session. Once it has been approved in plenary, the official opinion is sent to all the European institutions and published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

=== Resolutions ===
Resolutions enable the committee to express its view on important and topical issues. The CoR&#x27;s political groups or 32 CoR members can draw up resolutions.

=== Studies and other publications ===
The CoR produces studies on various aspects of the local and regional dimension of the EU (education, transport, social issues, enlargement, etc.). They are drawn up with the help of outside experts. The CoR also produces publications for both the general public and for regional and local players, aimed at explaining its activities and outlining current political developments.

=== Events ===
As a meeting place for regions and cities, the CoR organises conferences, seminars and exhibitions in cooperation with local and regional partners and other EU institutions. Once a year, during the European Week of Regions and Cities, the CoR welcomes to its headquarters thousands of participants who take part in lively discussions or seek partners to collaborate on joint projects.

==Key dates==
; 1992 – Maastricht Treaty
: EU leaders decide to set up the Committee of the Regions (CoR) as a consultative assembly which will provide regions and cities with a voice in the EU decision-making process and act as a direct link between Brussels and the citizens. The Treaty makes it mandatory for the European Commission and the Council of Ministers to consult the CoR on key areas of regional concern. CoR members are to be nominated by the governments of Member States and will serve for four years. In March 1994 the CoR holds its first plenary session in Brussels.
; 1995 – EU enlargement
: The CoR&#x27;s membership increases from 189 to 222, following the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden.
; 1997 – Amsterdam Treaty
: Extends the CoR&#x27;s remit to cover around two thirds of the EU&#x27;s legislative proposals. The Treaty also makes it possible for the Committee to be consulted by the European Parliament.
; 2001 – Nice Treaty
: Underlines the democratic legitimacy of the CoR by requiring that its members are elected or politically accountable to an elected regional or local assembly. Caps the number of members at 350.
; 2002–03 – Convention on the Future of the EU
: CoR members take part in the convention responsible for drafting an EU constitution. The text expressly recognises the role and powers of local and regional government; it also gives the CoR the right to go to the Court of Justice of the European Communities to challenge EU laws which do not comply with the principle of subsidiarity.
; May 2004 – EU enlargement
: Number of CoR members increases from 222 to 317, following the accession of 10 new Member States.
; February 2006 – New term of office
: The CoR starts a new four-year term. Its political priorities include boosting the role of local and regional authorities in line with the Lisbon Strategy for Jobs and Growth, strengthening cohesion and solidarity, and spearheading the &#x27;Communicating Europe – Going local&#x27; campaign to bring the EU closer to its citizens.
; January 2007 – EU enlargement
: With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the number of CoR members rises from 317 to 344.
; December 2007 – Lisbon Treaty
: The Lisbon Treaty confirms the CoR&#x27;s right to appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Communities to safeguard its prerogatives and the subsidiarity principle – a right already recognised by the Convention on the Future of the EU. This new entitlement will strengthen the CoR&#x27;s political role, by enabling it to act more effectively on the EU stage for the benefit of regional and local authorities. The Lisbon Treaty extends the term of office of CoR members from four to five years.
July 2013 – EU enlargement
: Number of CoR Members increases from 344 to 353, following the accession of Croatia (CoR members later decreased to 350).
Early 2020 – Brexit and Greens

Following Brexit (31 January), the number of CoR Members decreased to 329 due to the removal of the 24 members from the United Kingdom. As of February, a new Political Group was represented in the CoR, The Greens.

== Criticism ==
In 2020, the Committee of the Regions was criticized for its 20-year-old unresolved case of Robert McCoy, a former internal auditor, who has been severely harassed after he blew the whistle on &quot;fraud and embezzlement&quot; at the EU body. In his speech before the European Parliament, McCoy claimed the CoR had run &quot;a vindictive campaign&quot; against him and &quot;denigrated&quot; his personal and professional reputation. That issue made the Committee receive criticism also from the Dutch MEP Sophie in &#x27;t Veld, who used to work for the Committee of the Regions. She told Parliament that from her experience, the administration at the CoR had been &quot;totally incompetent and rotten to the core&quot;. She also accused the CoR of being stuck in &quot;full denial mode&quot; and suggested potential budgetary sanctions. One of the leading critics of the Committee of the Regions&#x27; inaction on this issue was also the Czech MEP Tomáš Zdechovský: &quot;When I look at this case, it reminds me of the American film &#x27;Groundhog Day&#x27; where the protagonist becomes trapped in a time loop&quot;.

<doc id="165280" wikidata="Q331024" url="?curid=165280" title="European Economic and Social Committee">
<text>The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) is a consultative body of the European Union (EU) established in 1958. It is an advisory assembly composed of representatives from employers&#x27; associations, workers&#x27; unions (trade unions) and civil society organisations. Its seat, which it shares with the Committee of the Regions, is the Jacques Delors building on Belliardstraat / Rue Belliard 99 in Brussels.

Once known by the acronym &quot;EcoSoc&quot;, the body is now referred to as the &quot;EESC&quot;, to avoid confusions with the United Nations ECOSOC.

==Role==
The European Economic and Social Committee was established by the Treaty of Rome of 1957 in order to unite different economic interest groups to establish a Single Market. The creation of this committee gave them an institution to allow their voices to be heard by the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament. The EESC declares itself to be &quot;a bridge between Europe and organised civil society&quot;.

It is mandatory for the committee to be consulted on those issues stipulated in the Treaties and in all cases where the institutions deem it appropriate. The Treaty of Maastricht considerably enlarged the committee&#x27;s domain. Its influence now extends to matters such as social policy, social and economic cohesion, environment, education, health, customers protection, industry, Trans-European Networks, indirect taxation and structural funds. On certain issues the EESC works in partnership with the Committee of the Regions.

In latest years, the committee has taken up the challenge of civil society, opening up its forum to representatives of all sectors, developing two complementary missions:
* Involving civil society organisations more in the European venture, at both national and European level,
* Boosting the role of civil society organisations in non-member countries or country groupings where the committee is furthering structured dialogue with civil society organisations, and promoting the creation of consultative structures based on its experiences, not least in the countries applying for EU membership, the Mediterranean partner countries, African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, India, China, Latin America (Mercosur) and Brazil.

==Operation==
It is mandatory for the committee to be consulted on those issues stipulated in the Treaties and in all cases where the institutions deem it appropriate. The EESC may also be consulted on an exploratory basis by one of the other institutions, and under Rule 29(2) of its Rules of Procedure may issue opinions on its own initiative. Around 15% of its opinions are own-initiative opinions.

Own-initiative and exploratory opinions often raise the awareness of decision-making bodies, and of the commission in particular, about subjects which have hitherto barely attracted their attention, if at all. Exploratory opinions drawn up at the request of other institutions before the commission has even drafted its proposals enable the various components of organised civil society represented within the EESC to express the expectations, concerns and needs of grassroots stakeholders.

The Committee adopts on average 170 opinions a year on a wide range of subjects concerning European integration. It therefore plays an active role in the processes of shaping Community policies and preparing Community decisions.

==Membership==
Currently, EESC membership numbers 329 (same as the Committee of the Regions). The number of members per EU state varies according to the population of each state (see table below for state-by-state membership figures; the breakdown is the same for the Committee of the Regions). Members of the EESC are divided into three groups of equal number, employers, employees and a third group of various other changing interests such as: farmers, consumer groups, professional associations and so on.

Members are appointed by the council (by qualified majority) following nominations made by the government of the respective Member State. However, once appointed, the members are completely independent of their governments. They have a renewable term of office of five years. The President of the EESC, elected for a -year term, is Oliver Röpke (since 2023), and the previous presidents were Christa Schweng (2020–2023) Luca Jahier (2018–2020) Georges Dassis (2015–2018) and Henri Malosse (2013–2015).

==Opinions==
Selected own-initiative opinions include:
*Opinion on the Value and supply chain development in a European and global context (adopted 25 April 2007) which argued that EU and member state agencies should work to improve the environment in which &quot;initial and intermediate companies&quot; operate within supply chains. Initialised as &quot;IICs&quot;, a term which was &quot;coined specifically for this opinion&quot;, the opinion refers to the relatively less visible, generally smaller or medium sized enterprises, at the lower tiers of supply chains, operating at early stages of the value creation process, often in innovative ways, and playing an important role in employment. The opinion notes that there is &quot;no established definition of IICs&quot; and that attitudes to such companies vary across member states and regions.
*Towards an ILO standard against gender-based violence at work (16 September 2015) 

==Critiques==
In a report reviewing 50 years of the EESC, C.S. Dimitrioulas cited Jacques Delors as saying that EESC contributions from 1958 to 2008 on civil and social matters were &quot;remarkable&quot;. Dimitrioulas commented: &quot;Thanks to its membership and unique role in the EU’s institutional framework, the Committee will in future have special responsibility for making a reality of participatory democracy and for working towards the development of structured dialogue between organised civil society and Union institutions.&quot;

The Lisbon Treaty has confirmed the EESC&#x27;s role and influence. According to proponents of the EESC: &quot;Indeed, significant prospects for the development of participatory democracy are opened through Article 11 of the new Treaty on the European Union, which lays the foundations for the future establishment of a genuine structured civil dialogue at European level alongside the political dialogue between the EU and its Member States and the social dialogue with the social partners, thereby ensuring sustainable participation of organised civil society in the European political process. In this context, the EESC has a particular responsibility in bringing participatory democracy to life. In view of its membership and role, as laid down in the Treaties, and in partnership with the other institutions, the Committee&#x27;s purpose is to be even more in the future the means of developing participatory democracy and civil dialogue at Union level.&quot;

In October 2020 reappointment of a Polish business representative Jacek Krawczyk for another five-year term as a member of the EESC became a target of harsh criticism as the EESC faced pressure to better prevent harassment in the organization. Mr. Krawczyk was himself accused of psychological harassment and is prosecuted by Belgian authorities. Besides that, the conduct of Jacek Krawczyk has been investigated by the EU’s anti-fraud office OLAF. MEPs therefore rejected the EESC’s 2018 financial accounts over its failure to deal with the issue of harassment. According to the words of MEP Tomáš Zdechovský, who led the budget discharge procedure, the EESC was not able to answer questions regarding its various mistakes and take measures which would make MEPs believe that this particular institution is able to protect the interests of European citizens.

Overall usefulness of the EESC has also been questioned recently. While the number of administrative staff has decreased from 727 in 2013 to 668 in 2019 and the number of opinions has gone down, the annual EESC&#x27;s budget has continued to grow. Czech MEP Tomáš Zdechovský said, that “very few lawmakers are reading the opinions of this committee. The impact is close to zero.” He also described the EESC as “a zombie committee that lost its purpose but still lives on.”

<text>Leaves are an Icelandic indie band formed in 2000.

==History==
Vocalist Arnar Gudjonsson was formerly the guitarist with Mower, and he was joined by Hallur Hallsson (bass guitar), Arnar Ólafsson (guitar, accordion), Bjarni Grímsson (drums), and Andri Ásgrímsson (keyboards). Late in 2001 they played with Emiliana Torrini and drew early praise from the &quot;New York Times&quot;. They came to prominence in 2002 with their single &quot;Race&quot; (which reached number 66 in the UK Singles Chart), and début album, &quot;Breathe&quot;, drawing comparisons to groups such as Coldplay, Muse, The Verve and Doves. The album was released in the UK first to positive reviews, reaching number 71 in the UK Albums Chart, then was re-released in the United States, and a tour of both the UK and the U.S. followed. Their second album, &quot;The Angela Test&quot;, was released in 2005 and their third album, &quot;We Are Shadows&quot;, was released in 2009. The group&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;See You in the Afterglow&quot;, arrived in 2013. In 2016, the group released a reworked version of &quot;Breathe&quot;. In 2017 vocalist Arnar formed a solo project, Warmland.

The name of the band refers to Nick Drake&#x27;s first album &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot;.
