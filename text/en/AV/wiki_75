<text>Video nasty is a colloquial term popularised by the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association (NVALA) in the United Kingdom to refer to a number of films, typically low-budget horror or exploitation films, distributed on video cassette in the early 1980s that were criticised by the press, social commentators, and various religious organisations for their violent content. These video releases were not brought before the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) due to a loophole in film classification laws that allowed videos to bypass the review process. The resulting uncensored video releases led to public debate concerning the availability of these films to children due to the unregulated nature of the market.

Following a campaign led by Mary Whitehouse and the NVALA, prosecutions were commenced against individuals engaged in trades exploiting allegedly obscene videos. To assist local authorities in identifying obscene films, the Director of Public Prosecutions released a list of 72 films the office believed to violate the Obscene Publications Act 1959. This list included films that had either been previously acquitted of obscenity or already obtained BBFC certification. In addition, a second list was released that contained an additional 82 titles which were not believed to lead to obscenity convictions but could nonetheless be confiscated under the Act&#x27;s forfeiture laws. The resultant confusion regarding the definition of obscene material led to Parliament passing the Video Recordings Act 1984, which required certification of video releases by the BBFC.

The implementation of the Video Recordings Act imposed a stricter code of censorship on videos than was required for cinema release. Several major studio productions were banned on video, as they fell within the scope of legislation designed to control the distribution of video nasties. In recent years, the stricter requirements have been relaxed, as numerous films once considered video nasties have obtained certification uncut or with minimal edits. Due to a legislative mistake discovered in August 2009, the Video Recordings Act 1984 was repealed and re-enacted without change by the Video Recordings Act 2010.

== Obscenity and video ==
At the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the United Kingdom during the 1970s, there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content, apart from the Obscene Publications Act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films. Major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films. Whilst some of these films had been passed by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) for cinema release, others had been refused certification which effectively banned them. The Obscene Publications Act defined obscenity as that which may &quot;tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it&quot;. This definition is of course open to wide interpretation.

If the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) felt that a certain video might be in breach of the Act, then a prosecution could be brought against the film&#x27;s producers, distributors and retailers. Prosecutions had to be fought on a case-by-case basis and a backlog of prosecutions built up. However, under the terms of the Act, the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the Act. In the early 1980s, in certain police constabularies, notably Greater Manchester Police which was at that time run by devout Christian Chief Constable James Anderton, police raids on video hire shops increased. The choice of titles seized appeared to be completely arbitrary, one raid famously netting a copy of the Dolly Parton musical &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982) under the mistaken belief it was pornographic.

The Video Retailers Association were alarmed by the apparently random seizures and asked the DPP to provide a guideline for the industry so that stockists could be made aware of the titles which were liable to be confiscated. The DPP recognised that the current system, where the interpretation of obscenity was down to individual Chief Constables, was inconsistent and decided to publish a list that contained names of films that had already resulted in a successful prosecution or where the DPP had already filed charges against the video&#x27;s distributors. This list became known as the DPP list of &quot;video nasties&quot;.

The lack of regulation of the domestic video market was in sharp contrast to the regulation of material intended for public screenings. The BBFC had been established in 1912, essentially as an unintended consequence of the Cinematograph Act 1909, and it was their responsibility to pass films intended for the cinema for certification within the United Kingdom (though local councils were the final arbiters). As part of this process the board could recommend, or demand in the more extreme cases, that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification. Such permission was not always granted, and in the case of the release of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; in 1973, a number of enterprising managers of cinemas where permission had been granted set about providing buses to transport cinema-goers from other localities where the film could not be seen.

== Public concern ==
Public awareness of the availability of these videos began in early 1982, when Vipco (Video Instant Picture Company), the UK distributors of &quot;The Driller Killer&quot;, a 1979 splatter film, took out full-page advertisements in a number of specialist video magazines, depicting the video&#x27;s explicit cover; an action which resulted in a large number of complaints to the Advertising Standards Agency. A few months later Go Video, the distributors of the already-controversial 1980 Italian film &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, in an effort to boost publicity and generate sales that ultimately backfired, wrote anonymously to Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association complaining about their own film. Whitehouse sparked off a public campaign and coined the term &quot;video nasty&quot;. Amid the growing concern, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; brought the issue to a wider audience in May 1982 with an article entitled &quot;How High Street Horror is Invading the Home&quot;. Soon the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; began their own campaign against the distribution of these films. The exposure of &quot;nasties&quot; to children began to be blamed for the increase in violent crime amongst youths. The growing media frenzy only served to increase the demand for such material among adolescents. At the suggestion of the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association, the Conservative MP Graham Bright introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill to the House of Commons in 1983. This was passed as the Video Recordings Act 1984 which came into effect on 1 September 1985.

== Effects of the Video Recordings Act 1984 ==
Under the 1984 Act, the British Board of Film Censors was renamed the &quot;British Board of Film Classification&quot; and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases. All video releases after 1 September 1985 had to comply with the Act and be submitted for classification by the BBFC. Films released on video before that date had to be re-submitted for classification within the following three years. The increased possibility of videos falling into the hands of children required that film classification for video be a separate process from cinema classification. Films that had passed uncut for cinema release were often cut for video.

The supply of unclassified videos became a criminal offence, as did supplying 15 and 18 certificate videos to under-aged people. As well as the low-budget horror films the Act was originally intended to curb, a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the Act. In particular, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, which was made available by Warner Home Video in December 1981, was not submitted for video certification by the BBFC and was withdrawn from shelves in 1986. Similarly &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; was denied video certification and removed from video stores. Popular culture backlash against the Video Recordings Act included the May 1984 release of &quot;Nasty&quot; by the punk-goth outfit The Damned, who celebrated the condemned genre with the lyrics &quot;I fell in love with a video nasty&quot;.

== Relaxation of censorship ==
With the passing of the Video Recordings Act, the films on the list could be prosecuted for both obscenity and not being classified. As well as not passing any film liable to be found obscene, the BBFC imposed additional bans and cuts on films such as &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. Claims, since proven at best to be speculative, at worst outright media fabrication, relating to the Hungerford massacre and the murder of James Bulger (where the 1991 film &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; was erroneously held up as influencing the perpetrators, possibly prompting the 1992 film &quot;Mikey&quot; to be prohibited in the UK), provided an additional impetus to restrict films and as late as December 1997, the board claimed it &quot;has never relaxed its guidelines on video violence, which remain the strictest in the world&quot;. However, the board did loosen its standards, especially at the 18 level, in response to public consultation in 2000. The departure of James Ferman from the BBFC may also have allowed some long-proscribed films to be re-appraised around this time. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was granted an uncut 18 video certificate on 25 February 1999, followed by &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; in August, and several official &quot;nasties&quot; were passed in the early 2000s either uncut or with cuts restricted to sexual violence or actual animals being harmed. A list of these is given below. Among modern films, many, such as the &quot;Hostel&quot; and &quot;Saw&quot; series, contain brutal, graphic violence but have passed through uncut.

In 2008, there was another brief media frenzy over such films that had years earlier been approved for release by the BBFC, in particular &quot;SS Experiment Camp&quot;. This coincided with an attempt by MPs Julian Brazier and Keith Vaz to pass a law allowing MPs greater powers to tighten BBFC guidelines or force an appeal of a release. The bill failed to pass.

The UK Government passed a law criminalising possession of &quot;extreme pornography&quot;. Whilst BBFC-rated films are exempt from the legislation, screenshots from these same BBFC-rated movies are not, and would also apply to unrated films. &quot;&quot; was cited in the House of Commons as an example of a film where screenshots could become illegal to possess.

== DPP list ==
The DPP list of &quot;video nasties&quot; was first made public in June 1983. The list was modified monthly as prosecutions failed or were dropped. In total, 72 separate films appeared on the list at one time or another. 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act but some of these films have been subsequently cut and then approved for release by the BBFC. The remaining 33 were either not prosecuted or had unsuccessful prosecutions. 10 films remain banned in the UK because they have not yet been resubmitted for classification by any distributors or have been rejected for classification.

A number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing. Ultimately, the list became obsolete when the Video Recordings Act came into force, and since 2001, several of the films have been released uncut. In the majority of cases below where cuts were made, they were scenes of real-life animal cruelty and/or excessive violence to women, both of which are still regarded with some degree of severity by the BBFC. A large number of these movies caused additional controversy with the cover art of the original big box releases seen in the video shops of the early 1980s. Unless noted otherwise, all films that have been released have been rated 18.

The DPP list is divided into two sections: &quot;Section 1&quot; and &quot;Section 2&quot;. Any title seized under Section 1 would make the dealer or distributor liable to prosecution for disseminating obscene materials. Dealers could be fined or jailed and the film itself would be declared obscene if the prosecution was successful, meaning it could not be distributed or sold in the UK until the obscenity was quashed. 39 of the Section 1 films were successfully prosecuted and remained banned. 33 of the Section 1 films had unsuccessful prosecutions and were subsequently dropped from the list and placed onto Section 2.

Section 2 titles were liable to be confiscated under a &quot;less obscene&quot; charge, which allowed the police to seize a film they considered obscene and as long as the dealer cooperated, they legally admit that the articles are obscene and therefore escape any personal prosecution. The 33 films that could not be prosecuted under Section 1 automatically became Section 2 titles and were still seized by the police. The main difference between Section 1 and 2 is that video dealers or distributors could be personally prosecuted in court for holding the film under Section 1 but not under Section 2, where the obscenity is admitted through forfeiting the material.

=== Films banned by the BBFC but not classed as video nasties ===
* &quot;Curfew&quot; — Banned for video in 1988. Released uncut in 2002.
* &quot;Maniac&quot; — Banned for cinema in 1981 and again for video in 1998. Released with 58 seconds of cuts in 2002. Released uncut in 2022.
* &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; — Banned for cinema in 1980. Released uncut in 2015.
* &quot;The New York Ripper&quot; — Banned for cinema in 1982 and re-exported to original distributor in Italy. Released with 29 seconds of cuts in 2002.
* &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2&quot; – Denied a BBFC certificate in 1987. The original &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot; was never submitted for UK release until 2008, when it was released uncut with an 18 certificate.
* &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; — Originally passed uncut for cinema. Withdrawn around the video nasty period but not actually included on the list. It was given an uncut theatrical re-release in 1995 but two subsequent attempts to pass the film for video in 1999 resulted in BBFC rejections. It was finally released uncut in 2002.

=== Other films seized by the police but not classed as video nasties ===
=== Other films ===
* &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; – Sometimes mistakenly believed to have been banned by the BBFC, it was actually Stanley Kubrick himself who withdrew the film from exhibition in the UK in 1973 on police advice. This was after receiving death threats toward himself and his family, as well as disliking reports found in the British Press that the film was responsible for copycat violence. Quoting Kubrick: &quot;To try and fasten any responsibility on art as the cause of life seems to me to put the case the wrong way around. Art consists of reshaping life but it does not create life, nor cause life. Furthermore, to attribute powerful suggestive qualities to a film is at odds with the scientifically accepted view that, even after deep hypnosis, in a posthypnotic state, people cannot be made to do things which are at odds with their natures&quot;. After Kubrick&#x27;s death, the film was re-released uncut at cinemas in the UK in 2000, and thereafter on both VHS and DVD.
* &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; – The film became notorious in the United Kingdom when it was suggested it might have inspired the real-life murder of British child James Bulger (a suggestion rejected by officers investigating the case) and the murder of Suzanne Capper (the police and the British Board of Film Classification ruled out any connection between the movie and the murder).
* &quot;The Exorcist&quot; – Although never officially cut or banned in the UK, several attempts to release the film on video were thwarted by BBFC censor James Ferman, who cited both the age of the possessed girl (as she was under 12, the film might have had significant appeal to underaged viewers) and reports of incidents of hysteria involving young women (leading to concerns that the film might cause severe emotional problems for those who believed in demonic possession) as obstacles to a home release. Following a successful theatrical re-release in 1998 and Ferman&#x27;s retirement as censor in January 1999, the film was submitted for home video release for the first time in February 1999, and was passed uncut with an &quot;18&quot; certificate. The film had previously been released on video in 1981, uncertificated, by Warner Home Video.
* &quot;Last House on Dead End Street&quot; – Also known as &quot;The Fun House&quot;, this film was probably the intended target when the BBFC added the similarly-entitled &quot;The Funhouse&quot; to the list. Passed uncut with an &quot;18&quot; certificate in 2006.
* &quot;Scum&quot; – The original TV film was made by the BBC, but they later decided not to broadcast it owing to the violence and suicides in the film. It was quickly remade by most of the original production team and released in cinemas, and was released on VHS at the height of the Video Nasties controversy, quickly becoming associated with them in the media.
* &quot;Mikey&quot; – The film was withdrawn from release in the United Kingdom following the James Bulger murder in Liverpool in 1993. The decision was made by the BBFC which refused to issue it with a UK release certificate in 1996. It remains prohibited in the UK.

==Ireland==
The moral concern extended to Ireland. In 1986, the Dáil Select Committee on Criminal Lawlessness and Vandalism issued a report &quot;Controls on video nasties&quot; recommending that the powers of the film censor&#x27;s office be extended to videos. This was implemented by the Video Recordings Act in 1989.

<doc id="164156" wikidata="Q229480" url="?curid=164156" title="Willa Cather">
<text>Willa Sibert Cather (; born Wilella Sibert Cather; December 7, 1873 – April 24, 1947) was an American writer known for her novels of life on the Great Plains, including &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot;, and &quot;My Ántonia&quot;. In 1923, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;One of Ours&quot;, a novel set during World War I.

Willa Cather and her family moved from Virginia to Webster County, Nebraska, when she was nine years old. The family later settled in the town of Red Cloud. Shortly after graduating from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, Cather moved to Pittsburgh for ten years, supporting herself as a magazine editor and high school English teacher. At the age of 33, she moved to New York City, her primary home for the rest of her life, though she also traveled widely and spent considerable time at her summer residence on Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick. She spent the last 39 years of her life with her domestic partner, Edith Lewis, before being diagnosed with breast cancer and dying of a cerebral hemorrhage. Cather and Lewis are buried together in Jaffrey, New Hampshire.

Cather achieved recognition as a novelist of the frontier and pioneer experience. She wrote of the spirit of those settlers moving into the western states, many of them European immigrants in the nineteenth century. Common themes in her work include nostalgia and exile. A sense of place is an important element in Cather&#x27;s fiction: physical landscapes and domestic spaces are for Cather dynamic presences against which her characters struggle and find community.

==Early life and education==
Cather was born in 1873 on her maternal grandmother&#x27;s farm in the Back Creek Valley near Winchester, Virginia. Her father was Charles Fectigue Cather. The Cather family originated in Wales, the name deriving from Cadair Idris, a Gwynedd mountain. Her mother was Mary Virginia Boak, a former school teacher. By the time Cather turned twelve months old, the family had moved to Willow Shade, a Greek Revival-style home on 130 acres given to them by her paternal grandparents.

Mary Cather had six more children after Willa: Roscoe, Douglass, Jessica, James, John, and Elsie. Cather was closer to her brothers than to her sisters whom, according to biographer Hermione Lee, she &quot;seems not to have liked very much.&quot;

At the urging of Charles Cather&#x27;s parents, the family moved to Nebraska in 1883 when Willa was nine years old. The farmland appealed to Charles&#x27; father, and the family wished to escape the tuberculosis outbreaks that were rampant in Virginia. Willa&#x27;s father tried his hand at farming for eighteen months, then moved the family into the town of Red Cloud, where he opened a real estate and insurance business, and the children attended school for the first time. Some of Cather&#x27;s earliest work was first published in the &quot;Red Cloud Chief,&quot; the city&#x27;s local paper, and Cather read widely, having made friends with a Jewish couple, the Wieners, who offered her free access to their extensive library in Red Cloud. At the same time, she made house calls with the local physician and decided to become a surgeon. For a short while, she signed her name as William, but this was quickly abandoned for Willa instead.

In 1890, at the age of sixteen, Cather graduated from Red Cloud High School. She moved to Lincoln, Nebraska to enroll at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. In her first year, her essay on Thomas Carlyle was published in the &quot;Nebraska State Journal&quot; without her knowledge. After this, she published columns for $1 apiece, saying that seeing her words printed on the page had &quot;a kind of hypnotic effect&quot;, pushing her to continue writing. After this experience, she became a regular contributor to the &quot;Journal&quot;. In addition to her work with the local paper, Cather served as the main editor of &quot;The Hesperian&quot;, the university&#x27;s student newspaper, and became a writer for the &quot;Lincoln Courier&quot;. While at the university, she learned mathematics from and was befriended by John J. Pershing, who later became General of the Armies and, like Cather, earned a Pulitzer Prize for his writing. She changed her plans from studying science with the goal of becoming a physician, instead graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1895.

Cather&#x27;s time in Nebraska, still considered a frontier state, was a formative experience for her: She was moved by the dramatic environment and weather, the vastness of the prairie, and the various cultures of the immigrant and Native American families in the area.

==Life and career==
In 1896, Cather was hired to write for a women&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Home Monthly&quot;, and moved to Pittsburgh. There, she wrote journalistic pieces, short stories, and poetry. A year later, after the magazine was sold, she became a telegraph editor and critic for the &quot;Pittsburgh Leader&quot; and frequently contributed poetry and short fiction to &quot;The Library&quot;, another local publication. In Pittsburgh, she taught Latin, algebra, and English composition at Central High School for one year; she then taught English and Latin at Allegheny High School, where she came to head the English department.

Shortly after moving to Pittsburgh, Cather wrote short stories, including publishing &quot;Tommy, the Unsentimental&quot; in the &quot;Home Monthly&quot;, about a Nebraskan girl with a masculine name who looks like a boy and saves her father&#x27;s bank business. Janis P. Stout calls this story one of several Cather works that &quot;demonstrate the speciousness of rigid gender roles and give favorable treatment to characters who undermine conventions.&quot; Cather resigned from her job at the Pittsburgh &quot;Leader&quot; in the late spring of 1900 before relocating to Washington, D.C. that fall. In April 1902, Cather published her final contribution to the Lincoln &quot;Courier&quot; before going abroad with Isabelle McClung that summer. Her first book, a collection of poetry called &quot;April Twilights&quot;, was published in 1903. Shortly after this, in 1905, Cather&#x27;s first collection of short stories, &quot;The Troll Garden&quot;, was published. It contained some of her most famous stories, including &quot;A Wagner Matinee,&quot; &quot;The Sculptor&#x27;s Funeral,&quot; and &quot;Paul&#x27;s Case.&quot;

After Cather was offered an editorial position at &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1906, she moved to New York City. Cather spent most of 1907 living in Boston, while working at &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, writing a series of exposés about the religious leader Mary Baker Eddy, although freelance journalist Georgine Milmine was credited as the author. A 1993 letter discovered in the Christian Science church archives by Eddy biographer Gillian Gill disclosed that Cather had (perhaps reluctantly) written articles 2 through 14 of the 14-part series. Milmine had performed copious amounts of research, but she had been unable to produce a manuscript independently, and &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; employed Cather and a few other editors including Burton J. Hendrick to assist her. This biography was serialized in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; over the next eighteen months and then published in book form as &quot;The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science&quot; (attributed to author Georgina Milmine, only confirmed decades later as really Willa Cather).

&quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; also serialized Cather&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Bridge&quot; (1912). While most reviews were favorable, such as &quot;The Atlantic&quot; calling the writing &quot;deft and skillful,&quot; Cather herself soon saw the novel as weak and shallow.

Cather followed &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Bridge&quot; with her three novels set in the Great Plains, which eventually became both popular and critical successes: &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; (1913), &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; (1915), and &quot;My Ántonia&quot; (1918), which are—taken together—sometimes referred to as her &quot;Prairie Trilogy.&quot; It is this succession of plains-based novels for which Cather was celebrated for her use of plainspoken language about ordinary people. Sinclair Lewis, for example, praised her work for making Nebraska available to the wider world for the first time. After writing &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, F. Scott Fitzgerald lamented that it was a failure in comparison to &quot;My Ántonia&quot;.

=== 1920s ===
As late as 1920, Cather became dissatisfied with the performance of her publisher, Houghton Mifflin, which devoted an advertising budget of only $300 to &quot;My Ántonia&quot;, and refused to pay for all the illustrations she commissioned for the book from Władysław T. Benda. What&#x27;s more, the physical quality of the books was poor. That year, she turned to the young publishing house, Alfred A. Knopf, which had a reputation for supporting its authors through advertising campaigns. She also liked the look of its books and had been impressed with its edition of &quot;Green Mansions&quot; by William Henry Hudson. She so enjoyed their style that all her Knopf books of the 1920s—save for one printing of her short story collection &quot;Youth and the Bright Medusa&quot;—matched in design on their second and subsequent printings.

By this time, Cather was firmly established as a major American writer, receiving the Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for her World War I-based novel, &quot;One of Ours&quot;. She followed this up with the popular &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; in 1927, selling 86,500 copies in just two years, and which has been included on the Modern Library 100 Best Novels of the twentieth century. Two of her three other novels of the decade—&quot;A Lost Lady&quot; and &quot;The Professor&#x27;s House&quot;—elevated her literary status dramatically. She was invited to give several hundred lectures to the public, earned significant royalties, and sold the movie rights to &quot;A Lost Lady&quot;. Her other novel of the decade, the 1926 &quot;My Mortal Enemy&quot;, received no widespread acclaim—and in fact, neither she nor her life partner, Edith Lewis, made significant mention of it later in their lives.

Despite her success, she was the subject of much criticism, particularly surrounding &quot;One of Ours&quot;. Her close friend, Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant, saw the novel as a betrayal of the realities of war, not understanding how to &quot;bridge the gap between [Cather&#x27;s] idealized war vision ... and my own stark impressions of war as &quot;lived&quot;.&quot; Similarly, Ernest Hemingway took issue with her portrayal of war, writing in a 1923 letter: &quot;Wasn&#x27;t [the novel&#x27;s] last scene in the lines wonderful? Do you know where it came from? The battle scene in &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;. I identified episode after episode, Catherized. Poor woman, she had to get her war experience somewhere.&quot;

In 1929, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

=== 1930s ===

By the 1930s, an increasingly large share of critics began to dismiss her as overly romantic and nostalgic, unable to grapple with contemporary issues: Granville Hicks, for instance, charged Cather with escaping into an idealized past to avoid confronting the problems of the present. And it was particularly in the context of the hardships of the Great Depression in which her work was seen as lacking social relevance. Similarly, critics—and Cather herself—were disappointed when her novel &quot;A Lost Lady&quot; was made into a film; the film had little resemblance to the novel.

Cather&#x27;s lifelong conservative politics, appealing to critics such as Mencken, Randolph Bourne, and Carl Van Doren, soured her reputation with younger, often left-leaning critics like Hicks and Edmund Wilson. Despite this critical opposition to her work, Cather remained a popular writer whose novels and short story collections continued to sell well; in 1931 &quot;Shadows on the Rock&quot; was the most widely read novel in the United States, and &quot;Lucy Gayheart&quot; became a bestseller in 1935.

Although Cather made her last trip to Red Cloud in 1931 for a family gathering after her mother&#x27;s death, she stayed in touch with her Red Cloud friends and sent money to Annie Pavelka and other families during the Depression years. In 1932, Cather published &quot;Obscure Destinies&quot;, her final collection of short fiction, which contained &quot;Neighbour Rosicky,&quot; one of her most highly regarded stories. That same summer, she moved into a new apartment on Park Avenue with Edith Lewis, and during a visit on Grand Manan, she probably began working on her next novel, &quot;Lucy Gayheart&quot;. She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1934.

Cather suffered two devastating losses in 1938. In June, her favorite brother, Douglass, died of a heart attack. Cather was too grief-stricken to attend the funeral. Four months later, Isabelle McClung died. Cather and McClung had lived together when Cather first arrived in Pittsburgh, and while McClung eventually married the musician Jan Hambourg and moved with her husband to Toronto, the two women remained devoted friends. Cather wrote that Isabelle was the person for whom she wrote all her books.

=== Final years ===

During the summer of 1940, Cather and Lewis went to Grand Manan for the last time, and Cather finished her final novel, &quot;Sapphira and the Slave Girl&quot;, a book much darker in tone and subject matter than her previous works. While Sapphira is understood by readers as lacking a moral sense and failing to evoke empathy, the novel was a great critical and commercial success, with an advance printing of 25,000 copies. It was then adopted by the Book of the Month Club, which bought more than 200,000 copies. Her final story, &quot;The Best Years&quot;, intended as a gift for her brother, was retrospective. It contained images or &quot;keepsakes&quot; from each of her twelve published novels and the short stories in &quot;Obscure Destinies&quot;.

Although an inflamed tendon in her hand hampered her writing, Cather managed to finish a substantial part of a novel set in Avignon, France. She had titled it &quot;Hard Punishments&quot; and placed it in the 14th century during the reign of Antipope Benedict XIV. She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1943. The same year, she executed a will that prohibited the publication of her letters and dramatization of her works. In 1944, she received the gold medal for fiction from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, a prestigious award given for an author&#x27;s total accomplishments.

Cather was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 1945 and underwent a mastectomy on January 14, 1946. By early 1947, her cancer had metastasized to her liver, becoming stage IV cancer.On April 24, 1947, Cather died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 73 in her home at 570 Park Avenue in Manhattan. After Cather&#x27;s death, Edith Lewis destroyed the manuscript of &quot;Hard Punishments&quot; according to Cather&#x27;s instructions. She is buried at the southwest corner of Jaffrey, New Hampshire&#x27;s Old Burying Ground, a place she first visited when joining Isabelle McClung and her husband, violinist Jan Hambourg, at the Shattuck Inn. Lewis was buried alongside Cather some 25 years later.

==Personal life==

Scholars disagree about Cather&#x27;s sexual identity. Some believe it impossible or anachronistic to determine whether she had same-sex attraction, while others disagree. Researcher Deborah Carlin suggests that denial of Cather being a lesbian is rooted in treating same-sex desire &quot;as an insult to Cather and her reputation&quot;, rather than a neutral historical perspective. Melissa Homestead has argued that Cather was attracted to Edith Lewis, and in so doing, asked: &quot;What kind of evidence is needed to establish this as a lesbian relationship? Photographs of the two of them in bed together? She was an integral part of Cather&#x27;s life, creatively and personally.&quot; Beyond her own relationships with women, Cather&#x27;s reliance on male characters has been used to support the idea of her same-sex attraction. Harold Bloom calls her &quot;erotically evasive in her art&quot; due to prevailing &quot;societal taboos&quot;.

In any event, throughout Cather&#x27;s adult life, her closest relationships were with women. These included her college friend Louise Pound; the Pittsburgh socialite Isabelle McClung, with whom Cather traveled to Europe and at whose Toronto home she stayed for prolonged visits; the opera singer Olive Fremstad; and most notably, the editor Edith Lewis, with whom Cather lived the last 39 years of her life.

Cather&#x27;s relationship with Lewis began in the early 1900s. They lived together in a series of apartments in New York City from 1908 until Cather&#x27;s death in 1947. From 1913 to 1927, Cather and Lewis lived at No. 5 Bank Street in Greenwich Village. They moved when the apartment was scheduled for demolition during the construction of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue New York City Subway line (now the ). While Lewis was selected as the literary trustee for Cather&#x27;s estate, she was not merely a secretary for Cather&#x27;s documents but an integral part of Cather&#x27;s creative process.

Beginning in 1922, Cather spent summers on the island of Grand Manan in New Brunswick, where she bought a cottage in Whale Cove on the Bay of Fundy. This is where her short story &quot;Before Breakfast&quot; is set. She valued the seclusion of the island and did not mind that her cottage had neither indoor plumbing nor electricity. Anyone wishing to reach her could do so by telegraph or mail. In 1940, she stopped visiting Grand Manan after Canada&#x27;s entrance to World War II, as travel was considerably more difficult; she also began a long recuperation from gallbladder surgery in 1942 that restricted travel.

A resolutely private person, Cather destroyed many drafts, personal papers, and letters, asking others to do the same. While many complied, some did not. Her will restricted the ability of scholars to quote from the personal papers that remain. But in April 2013, &quot;The Selected Letters of Willa Cather&quot;—a collection of 566 letters Cather wrote to friends, family, and literary acquaintances such as Thornton Wilder and F. Scott Fitzgerald—was published, two years after the death of Cather&#x27;s nephew and second literary executor, Charles Cather. Willa Cather&#x27;s correspondence revealed the complexity of her character and inner world. The letters do not disclose any intimate details about Cather&#x27;s personal life, but they do &quot;make clear that [her] primary emotional attachments were to women.&quot; The Willa Cather Archive at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln works to digitize her complete body of writing, including private correspondence and published work. As of 2021, about 2,100 letters have been made freely available to the public, in addition to transcription of her own published writing.

==Writing influences==
Cather admired Henry James&#x27;s use of language and characterization. While Cather enjoyed the novels of several women—including George Eliot, the Brontës, and Jane Austen—she regarded most women writers with disdain, judging them overly sentimental. One contemporary exception was Sarah Orne Jewett, who became Cather&#x27;s friend and mentor. Jewett advised Cather of several things: to use female narrators in her fiction (even though Cather preferred using male perspectives), to write about her &quot;own country&quot; (&quot;O Pioneers!&quot; was dedicated to Jewett), and to write fiction that explicitly represented romantic attraction between women. Cather was also influenced by the work of Katherine Mansfield, praising in an essay Mansfield&#x27;s ability &quot;to throw a luminous streak out onto the shadowy realm of personal relationships.&quot;

Cather&#x27;s high regard for the immigrant families forging lives and enduring hardships on the Nebraska plains shaped much of her fiction. The Burlington Depot in Red Cloud brought in many strange and wonderful people to her small town. As a child, she visited immigrant families in her area and returned home in &quot;the most unreasonable state of excitement,&quot; feeling that she &quot;had got inside another person&#x27;s skin.&quot; After a trip to Red Cloud in 1916, Cather decided to write a novel based on the events in the life of her childhood friend Annie Sadilek Pavelka, a Bohemian girl who became the model for the title character in &quot;My Ántonia&quot;. Cather was likewise fascinated by the French-Canadian pioneers from Quebec who had settled in the Red Cloud area while she was a girl.

During a brief stopover in Quebec with Edith Lewis in 1927, Cather was inspired to write a novel set in that French-Canadian city. Lewis recalled: &quot;From the first moment that she looked down from the windows of the [Chateau] Frontenac [Hotel] on the pointed roofs and Norman outlines of the town of Quebec, Willa Cather was not merely stirred and charmed—she was overwhelmed by the flood of memories, recognition, surmise it called up; by the sense of its extraordinary French character, isolated and kept intact through hundreds of years, as if by a miracle, on this great un-French continent.&quot; Cather finished her novel &quot;Shadows on the Rock&quot;, a historical novel set in 17th-century Quebec, in 1931; it was later included in &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–1944. The French influence is found in many other Cather works, including &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; (1927) and her final, unfinished novel set in Avignon, &quot;Hard Punishments&quot;.

==Literary style and reception==
Although Cather began her writing career as a journalist, she made a distinction between journalism, which she saw as being primarily informative, and literature, which she saw as an art form. Cather&#x27;s work is often marked by—and criticized for—its nostalgic tone and themes drawn from memories of her early years on the American plains. Consequently, a sense of place is integral to her work: notions of land, the frontier, pioneering and relationships with western landscapes are recurrent. Even when her heroines were placed in an urban environment, the influence of place was critical, and the way that power was displayed through room layout and furniture is evident in her novels like &quot;My Mortal Enemy&quot;. Though she hardly confined herself to writing exclusively about the Midwest, Cather is virtually inseparable from the Midwestern identity that she actively cultivated (even though she was not a &quot;native&quot; Midwesterner). While Cather is said to have significantly altered her literary approach in each of her novels, this stance is not universal; some critics have charged Cather with being out of touch with her times and failing to use more experimental techniques in her writing, such as stream of consciousness. At the same time, others have sought to place Cather alongside modernists by either pointing to the extreme effects of her apparently simple Romanticism or acknowledging her own &quot;middle ground&quot;:

She had formed and matured her ideas on art before she wrote a novel. She had no more reason to follow Gertrude Stein and James Joyce, whose work she respected, than they did to follow her. Her style solves the problems in which she was interested. She wanted to stand midway between the journalists whose omniscient objectivity accumulate more fact than any character could notice and the psychological novelist whose use of subjective point of view stories distorts objective reality. She developed her theory on a middle ground, selecting facts from experience on the basis of feeling and then presenting the experience in a lucid, objective style.

The English novelist A. S. Byatt has written that with each work Cather reinvented the novel form to investigate the changes in the human condition over time. Particularly in her frontier novels, Cather wrote of both the beauty and terror of life. Like the exiled characters of Henry James, an author who had a significant influence on the author, most of Cather&#x27;s major characters live as exiled immigrants, identifying with the immigrants&#x27; &quot;sense of homelessness and exile&quot; following her own feelings of exile living on the frontier. It is through their engagement with their environment that they gain their community. Susan J. Rosowski wrote that Cather was perhaps the first to grant immigrants a respectable position in American literature.

<doc id="164163" wikidata="Q137308" url="?curid=164163" title="Blueberry (comics)">
<text>Blueberry is a Western comic series created in the Franco-Belgian &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; (BD) tradition by the Belgian scriptwriter Jean-Michel Charlier and French comics artist Jean &quot;Mœbius&quot; Giraud. It chronicles the adventures of Mike Steve Donovan alias Blueberry on his travels through the American Old West. Blueberry is an atypical western hero; he is not a wandering lawman who brings evil-doers to justice, nor a handsome cowboy who &quot;rides into town, saves the ranch, becomes the new sheriff and marries the schoolmarm&quot;. In any situation, he sees what he thinks needs doing, and he does it.

The series spawned out of the 1963 &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; comics series, originally intended as an ensemble narrative, but which quickly gravitated around the breakout character &quot;Blueberry&quot; as the main and central character after the first two stories, causing the series to continue under his name later on. The older stories, released under the &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; moniker, were ultimately reissued under the name &quot;Blueberry&quot; as well in later reprint runs. Two spin-off, or rather, sub-series, La Jeunesse de Blueberry (Young Blueberry) and Marshal Blueberry, were created pursuant the main series reaching its peak in popularity in the early 1980s.

It has been remarked that during the 1960s, Blueberry &quot;was as much a staple in French comics as, say, &quot;The Avengers&quot; or &quot;The Flash&quot; here [in the USA]&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Born on 30 October 1843 on Redwood Plantation near Augusta, Georgia, Michael Steven Donovan is the son of a rich Southern planter and starts out life as a decided racist. On the brink of the American Civil War, Donovan is forced to flee north after being framed for the murder of his fiancée Harriet Tucker&#x27;s father, a plantation owner. On his flight toward the Kentucky border, he is saved by Long Sam, a fugitive African-American slave from his father&#x27;s estate, who paid with his life for his act of altruism. Inspired when he sees a blueberry bush, Donovan chooses the surname &quot;Blueberry&quot; as an alias when rescued from his Southern pursuers by a Union cavalry patrol (during his flight war had broken out between the States). After enlisting in the Union Army, he becomes an enemy of discrimination of all kinds, fighting against the Confederates (although being a Southerner himself, first enlisting as a bugler in order to avoid having to fire upon his former countrymen), later trying to protect the rights of Native Americans. He starts his adventures in the Far West as a lieutenant in the United States Cavalry shortly after the war. On his many travels in the West, Blueberry is frequently accompanied by his trusted companions, the hard-drinking deputy Jimmy McClure, and later also by &quot;Red Neck&quot; Wooley, a rugged pioneer and army scout.

===Characters===
==Publication history==
In his youth, Giraud had been a passionate fan of American Westerns and &quot;Blueberry&quot; has its roots in his earlier Western-themed works such as the &quot;Frank et Jeremie&quot; shorts, which were drawn for &quot;Far West&quot; magazine when he was only 18 – also having been his first sales as free-lancer – and the by Joseph &quot;Jijé&quot; Gillain heavily inspired Western short stories he created for the magazines from French publisher (his first professional tenured employment as comic artist in the period 1956–1958), in particular the series of short Western comics featuring the same protagonist Art Howell which can be considered as Giraud&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; first realistic Western series (and thus a precursor to &quot;Blueberry&quot;), as he himself did in effect, since he, save the first one, endowed these stories with the subtitle &quot;&quot;Un aventure&quot; d&#x27;Art Howell&quot;. This was followed by his collaboration with Jijé himself on an episode of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Jerry Spring&quot; series in 1960, which appeared in the Belgian comics magazine &quot;Spirou&quot; (&quot;&quot;, issues 1192 – 1213, 1961), aside from his subsequent Western contributions to Benoit Gillian&#x27;s (son of Jijé) short-lived comic magazine &quot;Bonux-Boy&quot; (1960/61). Directly before he started his apprenticeship at Jijé, Jean Giraud had already approached Jean-Michel Charlier on his own accord, asking him if he was interested in writing scripts for a new western series for publication in &quot;Pilote&quot;, the just by Charlier co-launched legendary French comic magazine. Charlier refused on that occasion, claiming he never felt much empathy for the genre. Biographer though, has noted that Charlier, when he felt he was preaching to the choir, had the tendency to &quot;take liberties&quot; with actual events for dramatic effect. Charlier had in effect already written several Westerns, both comics and illustrated short prose stories, in the period 1949-1959 for various previous magazines. One such short entailed the text comic &quot;Cochise&quot; in &quot;Jeannot&quot; magazine, July 1957, dealing with the historical &quot;Bascom Affair&quot;, which six years later would become the apotheosis of the first &quot;Blueberry&quot; story, &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;. Furthermore, Charlier had already visited the South-West of the United States in 1960, resulting in several Native-American themed educational &quot;Pilote&quot; editorials.

In 1962, the magazine sent Charlier on a reporting assignment around the world for its editorials, and one of his last 1963 ports of call was Edwards Airforce Base in the Mojave Desert, California. He took the opportunity to (re-)discover the American West, returning to France with a strong urge to write a western. First he asked Jijé to draw the series, but Jijé, a lifelong friend and collaborator of Charlier, thought there would be a conflict of interest, since he was then a tenured artist at &quot;Spirou&quot;, a competing comic magazine, which published his own Western comic &quot;Jerry Spring&quot;, and in which he was very much invested. In his stead, Jijé proposed his protégé Giraud as the artist. A happy coincidence was that Giraud was also intimately familiar with the landscapes that had inspired Charlier, as he already had been on an extended stay of nine months in Mexico in 1956, where the endless blue skies and unending flat plains of Mexico&#x27;s northern deserts had &quot;cracked open his mind&quot;.

===Original publications in French===

:&quot;note: English titles in parentheses where they exist and when first mentioned, original titles only where none are available&quot;
&quot;Blueberry&quot; was first published in the October 31, 1963 issue of &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine – hence Charlier&#x27;s corresponding October 30 birth-date for his fictional character, when the magazine was printed and ready for dissemination. Initially titled &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, the story grew into 46 pages over the following issues. In this series Blueberry – whose physical appearance was inspired by French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo – was only one of many protagonists; the series was originally intended to be an assemble narrative, but quickly gravitated towards Blueberry as the central and primary character, even though the series&#x27; (sub-)title &quot;Fort Navajo, une Aventure du Lieutenant Blueberry&quot; was maintained for a decade by original publisher Dargaud for the numerous reprint, and international, runs, before the &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; (sub-)moniker was finally dropped in 1973 with the book publication of &quot;L&#x27;homme qui valait 500 000 $&quot; (&quot;The Half-a-Million Dollar Man&quot;). Charlier came up with the name during his American trip: &quot;When I was traveling throughout the West, I was accompanied by a fellow journalist who was just in love with blueberry jam, so much in love, in fact, that I had nicknamed him &#x27;Blueberry&#x27;. When I began to create the new series, and everything started to fall into place, I decided to reuse my friend&#x27;s nickname, because I liked it and thought it was funny. [...] I had no idea that he would prove so popular that he would eventually take over the entire series, and later we would be stuck with that silly name!&quot; In an anecdote, Charlier related how caught off guard he had been: &quot;My memory is a somewhat like a sieve. In the first album, Blueberry was called Steve. I forgot that first name and then I named him Mike. So, in order to get things straight, I coined him Mike Steve Blueberry eventually; this kind of forgetfulness happens to me often&quot;.

Part of the Blueberry&#x27;s breakout popularity, had been his rebellious, anti-establishment character traits he had been intentionally and uncharacteristically endowed with by co-creator Charlier and very much the opposite of the other law abiding, squeaky clean comic heroes, Charlier had usually created up until then. This was however, in line with the prevailing mood of the counterculture of the 1960s, influences from which even the right-wing conservative Charlier could not escape entirely. It has enticed him to indulge in a little creative experimentation with the Blueberry character, having become somewhat bored and fed up with his own squeaky clean comic heroes, the military ones like &quot;Buck Danny&quot; in particular – Charlier usually reserved foibles for his secondary main characters to provide his creations with some levity and humanity, such as Blueberry&#x27;s flawed friend Jimmy McClure. In stark contrast, one of the other intended major characters of the &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; series had been Blueberry&#x27;s friend and colleague lieutenant Graig, who was very much a classic Charlier comics hero, law abiding, a stickler for rules and regulations, unquestioning in his blind obedience to, and acceptance of, authority, and so on. Charlier had apparently expected the presence of the Blueberry character in his creation to be of a transient nature, as he represented everything that Charlier was personally opposed to in private life, quite strongly so according to biographer Ratier.

Due to the fact that Blueberry became the most popular character so early on in the &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; story-arc, Charlier was forced to do an about-face and started to write out the other main characters, including lieutenant Graig, he had in place in order to make room for Blueberry. However, in one instance that had an unexpected side effect; when Charlier killed off the Native-American lieutenant Crowe in the fifth and last installment of the story-arc, &quot;La piste des Navajos&quot; (&quot;Trail of the Navajo&quot;), the editorial offices of &quot;Pilote&quot; received many angry letters from readers accusing Charlier of murdering a sympathetic protagonist. Taken aback, Charlier later stated: &quot;It was too late to do anything about it, it was done. A strange experience, Giraud in particular took it very hard&quot;. Still, while all characters slated for prominence were written out, Blueberry excepted, one major, recurrent secondary character was written in over the course of the story arc in &quot;Le cavalier perdu&quot; (&quot;Mission to Mexico&quot;), Blueberry&#x27;s friend and sidekick Jimmy McClure. Actually, and by his own admission, Charlier had originally written McClure as a temporary, minor background character, but Giraud was so taken with the character that he asked Charlier to expand his role in the series, and which stands out as the earliest known instance of Giraud exercising influence on the scripts of his senior colleague.

In post-war Europe, it has been tradition to release comics in &quot;pre-publication&quot; as serialized magazine episodes, before publication as a comic book, or rather comic album (in North-American understanding though, &quot;graphic novel&quot; is the more applicable terminology in this case, particularly where the physical properties of the book format are concerned, the distinction being otherwise a non-issue in native France), typically with a one to two year lag. In French, &quot;(Young) Blueberry&quot; has firstly seen serialized pre-publication in &quot;Pilote&quot; (issue 210, 31 October 1963 – issue 720, 23 August 1973) and &quot;&quot; (issue 1, 1 July 1969 – issue 9, 19 October 1970) from publisher Dargaud, the parent and main publisher of &quot;Blueberry&quot;, with Giraud frequently creating original &quot;Blueberry&quot; art for the magazine covers and illustrations for editorials, aside from creating on occasion summarizing, introduction plates, none of which reprinted in the original book editions. Nonetheless, much of this material did find its way in later reprint variations, particularly in the editorials of the 2012-2019 main series anthology, or omnibus, collection – invariably called &quot;integral(e)s&quot; in the respective languages of mainland Europe – of parent publisher Dargaud, and in those of their licensees such as Egmont for their earlier German/Danish/Norwegian 2006-2017 &quot;all&quot;-series integral edition collection
The first (French) &quot;Blueberry&quot; comic album, &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, was released in September 1965 and originally appeared as the 17th (and last) volume of the &quot;La Collection Pilote&quot; series. Actually, this collection had been an initiative of Charlier himself in his function as publishing co-editor, and the 17 titles in the collection were in effect Dargaud&#x27;s first comic album releases, and an influential release at that. In order to give these releases a more &quot;mature&quot; image, the books were from the start executed as hard cover editions. Favorably received and though not being the first, the hard cover format became the norm in France definitively, where henceforth all comic albums were executed in the format – becoming indeed generally accepted as a mature part of French culture eventually – whereas the vast majority of the other European countries continued to employ the soft cover format for decades to come, somewhat reflecting the status comic books held in their respective societies at the time. These included for the time being French-Belgium as well, Charlier&#x27;s native country, where the exact same collection was concurrently licensed to, and released by Le Lombard, albeit as soft cover only. Charlier&#x27;s initiative was not entirely devoid of a healthy dose of self-interest, as over half the releases in the collection, were, aside from &quot;Blueberry&quot;, titles from other comic series he had co-created. After &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, the collection was suspended and each comic hero hitherto featured therein, spun off in book series of their own, including &quot;Blueberry&quot; or rather &quot;Fort Navajo, une Aventure du Lieutenant Blueberry&quot; as it was then still coined.

After Dargaud had lost publishing rights for over a decade for new &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles to firstly German publisher and subsequently to Belgian publisher , as a result from a conflict with the creators over &quot;Blueberry&quot; royalties, the series has seen, predominantly one-time only, French pre-publication in such comic magazines as &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Other European countries followed the same template with local magazines. However, the format, for decades a staple in Europe and shaping entire generations of comic readers, went out of vogue in the late 1980s/early 1990s and the vast majority of European comic magazines have since then become defunct by the mid-1990s, including those from Belgium, the country were the phenomenon was born in the late 1930s. Ironically, while &quot;Le bout de la piste&quot; (&quot;The End of the Trail&quot;) and &quot;Arizona Love&quot; became main series titles to see serialized pre-publication elsewhere, neither were serialized as such in France itself, where &quot;La tribu fantôme&quot; (&quot;The Ghost Tribe&quot;) had previously become the last &quot;Blueberry&quot; title pre-published as such in &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot;. Henceforth, new &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles were until 1997 directly released in album format, starting with the 1990 &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; (&quot;Young Blueberry&quot;) title, &quot;Le raid infernal&quot;. Any subsequent French magazine, or newspaper serialized publication occurred &quot;after&quot; the initial book release while &quot;Blueberry&quot; was housed at Novedi and its successor, Swiss publisher , and which had actually already included &quot;Angel Face&quot; in &quot;Nouveau Tintin&quot;, and &quot;La dernière carte&quot; (&quot;The Last Card&quot;) in &quot;Spirou&quot; previously, both having been serialized after their respective book releases.

After Charlier had died on 10 July 1989, Giraud, aside from completing &quot;Arizona Love&quot; on his own, wrote and drew five albums, from &quot;Mister Blueberry&quot; to &quot;Dust&quot; (constituting the &quot;OK Corral&quot; story arc), until his own death in 2012. Additionally, Giraud also scripted the intermezzo series &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; (1991-2000), but had no creative input for the &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; prequel series, after the first three, original volumes.

By the time Giraud embarked on the &quot;OK Corral&quot; cycle, publishing rights had returned to Dargaud, and that publisher decided to revitalize the magazine serialized pre-publication format as part of their marketing effort on behalf of &quot;Blueberry&quot;″s return (see &quot;below&quot;), albeit with a twist; As Dargaud no longer had a comic magazine of their own (&quot;Pilote&quot; had become defunct in 1989), it was decided to farm out pre-publication to parties who showed the most interest, resulting in that &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles in that cycle became serialized in different publications, not all necessarily comic-related by origin. The summer of 1997 saw the serialization of &quot;Ombres sur Tombstone&quot; in the French daily newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, followed by the pre-publication of &quot;Géronimo l&#x27;Apache&quot; in the monthly &quot;&quot; comic magazine, directly before the album release in October 1999 as part of Dargaud&#x27;s substantial marketing campaign for the album. The next title, &quot;OK Corral&quot;, was published in a similar manner in the summer of 2003 in the &quot;L&#x27;ExpressMag&quot; appendix of the non-comic weekly news magazine &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;.

The mere fact that serious newspapers and magazines were by then vying for the opportunity to run &quot;Blueberry&quot; in their publications first (aside from the above-mentioned publications, the newspaper &quot;France-Soir&quot; had already run the first two outings of the revitalized &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; series in 1985 and 1987 – see &quot;below&quot;), was testament to the status &quot;Blueberry&quot; and its creator(s) had by then attained in Francophone Europe.

====Royalties conflict (1974–1979)====

With the growing popularity of &quot;Blueberry&quot; came the increasing disenchantment over financial remunerations of the series. Already in 1974, Charlier made his displeasure known in this regard, when he had &quot;Angel Face&quot; pre-published in &quot;Nouveau Tintin&quot; of industry competitor Le Lombard, the first time a &quot;Blueberry&quot; adventure was not serialized in &quot;Pilote&quot; – nor would it ever be again in hindsight. The magazine was forced to drop the announcement page it had prepared for the story. Unfazed, Dargaud founder and owner Georges Dargaud, unwilling to give in, countered by having the book released before &quot;Nouveau Tintin&quot; had even had the chance to run the story. Then Giraud left on his own accord. While Charlier had no influence on this whatsoever, it did serve a purpose as far as he was concerned. Giraud had left &quot;Blueberry&quot; on a cliff-hanger with &quot;Angel Face&quot;, resulting in an insatiable demand for more, putting the pressure on Dargaud. Whenever Georges Dargaud asked Charlier for a next &quot;Blueberry&quot; adventure, repeatedly, Charlier was now able to respond that he was &quot;devoid of inspiration&quot;.

As a matter of fact, Giraud was dying to leave &quot;Pilote&quot; and &quot;Blueberry&quot;, partly because he was tired of the stifling publication pressure he was under in order to produce the series, partly because of the royalties conflict, but &quot;mostly&quot; because he wanted to further explore and develop his artistic &quot;Mœbius&quot; alter ego. For Giraud the conflict was actually a godsend: &quot;At that moment Charlier and I also had a financial conflict with Dargaud which came at the exact right time, because it provided me with an alibi [to leave]&quot;. The latter reason for him to leave, took on an urgency after Alejandro Jodorowsky, impressed by his &quot;Blueberry&quot; art, had already invited Giraud to come over to Los Angeles to work as concept designer and storyboard artist on his &quot;Dune&quot; movie project earlier that year, constituting the first Jodorowsky/Mœbius collaboration. Very eager to return to Los Angeles as Jodorowsky requested his presence again, Giraud – who had returned to France for his other work during one of the lulls in the &quot;Dune&quot; production – greatly accelerated his work on &quot;Angel Face&quot;, then underway, breaking his &quot;absolute record speed-drawing&quot;, as he had coined it, and sheared off weeks from its originally intended completion date. Giraud in overdrive was so fast that he even overtook Charlier&#x27;s script pages (Charlier habitually fed his artists piecemeal with script pages, usually a couple at the time), forcing him to write ten pages of the story on his own, as Charlier was at that time on documentary assignment in the United States for French television. Upon his return, Charlier took one look at the pages completed in his absence, and continued where Giraud had left off without further much ado. Charlier himself had actually already left Dargaud in 1972, because he additionally felt ill at ease with the editorial modernization of &quot;Pilote&quot;, which resulted from the 1968 revolt at the editorial offices staged by key artists, chief among them Giraud (see also: &quot;Giraud on his part in the uprising at Pilote&quot;). Though Charlier continued to provide his younger colleague with scripts (but not his other artists), he started working as documentary maker for French television. It was while he was working on two documentaries on the Mexican Revolution that he gained inspiration for his below-mentioned &quot;Les Gringos&quot; Western comic series, which started its run in 1979 at Koralle.

It was the first time that Giraud wrote for &quot;Blueberry&quot; by himself, and was, considering Charlier&#x27;s easy acceptance of Giraud&#x27;s writing, also testament to the close, and trusting working relationship both men had cultivated by that time. Incidentally, Giraud intimated that the deteriorating circumstances at &quot;Pilote&quot; had already left its mark on him before he left: &quot;The story was started in 1972/73 but remained shelved until 1975 [sic.]. Yet, I think one can not discern its difficult birth; there are good scenes, pages I really poured heart and soul into. It is true that [the art for] &quot;Le hors-la-loi&quot; (&quot;The Outlaw&quot;) had been quite weak, but &quot;Angel Face&quot; made up for it&quot;.

Five years later, Giraud was ready to return to &quot;Blueberry&quot;, at long last feeling the urge again to do so, but &quot;not&quot; into the employ of &quot;Pilote&quot;/Dargaud, as he had formally terminated his position in 1974 with no intention whatsoever to return, instead plying his &quot;Blueberry&quot; trade as a freelancer: &quot;Publishers were waving with those fat checks, so we started again. But it is no longer the same. I won&#x27;t be taken in by &quot;Blueberry&quot; anymore!&quot;, referring to the first half of the 1970s when he felt smothered by his co-creation. Yet, the whole business surrounding &quot;Blueberry&quot; residuals itself remained unresolved, and in order to drive home the point the pe-publication of the eagerly awaited &quot;Nez Cassé&quot; (&quot;Broken Nose&quot;) story was farmed out to &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; magazine (published by Les Humanoïdes Associés, co-founded by Giraud in 1974, and in the US released as &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; in the mid-1970s, though the story was not run in the American version), instead of &quot;Pilote&quot;. That Charlier was able to repeat this ploy after &quot;Angel Face&quot; stemmed from the proviso he had built in when he signed over the publication, and copyrights of his syndication agency EdiFrance/EdiPresse – co-established in 1955 with Victor Hubinon, Albert Uderzo, and René Goscinny for the express purpose to syndicate their own and other artist&#x27;s comic creations – to Dargaud in 1960. On that occasion Charlier, owning a law degree, stipulated an exemption clause for magazine (pre-)publications of his own (co-)creations. Though never intended as such, the hitherto dormant exemption clause now served him well in his conflict with Dargaud, without having to fear for any legal ramifications on Dargaud&#x27;s part. Yet, Georges Dargaud refused to take the bait and the creators subsequently put forward the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; western comic as a last ditch effort to spell out to Dargaud that the creators had other options. Dargaud still would not budge. It was then that it became clear to Charlier, that he was left with no other option than to leave, and this he did taking all his other co-creations with him, to wit &quot;Redbeard&quot; and &quot;Tanguy et Laverdure&quot;, which, while not as popular as &quot;Blueberry&quot;, were steady money making properties for Dargaud nonetheless.

====Blueberry&#x27;s publishing wanderings (1979–1990)====
Though they were still contractually obligated to leave their most recent &quot;Blueberry&quot; title, &quot;Nez Cassé&quot;, at Dargaud for book publication, Charlier and Giraud then threw in their lot with German publisher Koralle-Verlag – incidentally the first German language &quot;Blueberry&quot; book publisher back in the early 1970s – a subsidiary at the time of German media giant Axel Springer SE, for their next publication, &quot;La longue marche&quot; (&quot;The Long March&quot;). The choice for the German publisher was made for their very ambitious international expansion strategy they had in place at that time. Fully subscribing to the publisher&#x27;s strategy, Charlier not only revitalized his &quot;Redbeard&quot; and &quot;Tanguy et Laverdure&quot; comic series – having been equally &quot;devoid of inspiration&quot; for these as well in the 1974-1979 &quot;Pilote&quot;-era because of the royalties issue – but created the new Western comic, &quot;Les Gringos&quot; (art by Victor de la Fuente), as well. Yet, for all Charlier&#x27;s business acumen, he had failed to recognize that Koralle&#x27;s exuberant expansion drive had essentially been a do-or-die effort on their part. In 1978 Koralle was on the verge of bankruptcy, and a scheme was devised to stave off this fate; international expansion. In the European comics world that was a rather novel idea at the time and Koralle did expand beyond the German border into large parts of Europe with variants of their main publication &quot;Zack&quot; magazine, with the revived &quot;Blueberry&quot; as its flagship, accompanied with comic book releases. It did not pay off however, as the holding company already pulled the plug in 1980, leaving &quot;Blueberry&quot; and the others quite unexpectedly without a publishing home.

It were not only the &quot;Blueberry&quot; creators that were left in a pickle, as Koralle had managed to convince other well known Franco-Belgian comic artists to switch sides. Aside from Giraud&#x27;s old mentor Jijé (who, having abandoned his own &quot;Jerry Spring&quot; Western comic, was now penciling Charlier&#x27;s revitalized &quot;Redbeard&quot; and &quot;Tanguy et Laverdure&quot;), these predominantly concerned artists from publishing house Le Lombard. The most prominent of the latter was Hermann Huppen with his new post-apocalyptic Western &quot;Jeremiah&quot; for which he had abandoned that other famed 1970s Franco-Belgian Western, &#x27; (written by Greg), second only in renown after &quot;Blueberry&quot; at the time. Tapping into his substantial social Franco-Belgian comic network, Charlier found Jacques de Kezel – a highly influential behind-the-scenes figure of the Belgian comics world at those times, and who had actually gathered the stable of artists for Koralle – willing for Axel Springer to pass the torch to. As a token of goodwill, a relieved Springer, as they now could turn over the current contractual obligations without much further ado, even allowed the French-language version of &quot;Zack&quot;, &quot;Super As&quot;, to run for a few issues longer in order to allow as many series as possible to complete their magazine run, which included &quot;La longue marche&quot;. De Kezel&#x27;s new publishing house &quot;Les Nouvelles Editions Internationales S.A.&quot; (Novedi) was established in November 1980 with its seat in Brussels, Belgium. Part of their strategy was to forego on a magazine of their own and instead release titles directly in album format, as it was noticed that the serialized comic magazine format had already started to wane in Europe as a format (and actually one of the main reasons for Axel Springer to pull the plug on Koralle), resulting in the advantage of not having to incur the expenses of maintaining magazine editorial offices. Any still existing comic magazine elsewhere, willing to publish serialized comic series after the initial book releases, was merely considered an added bonus.

Still, it took some time for the new publisher to get up and running, and some sort of stop-gap resolution had to be found for the intervening 1979-1980 period in order to secure income for the stable of comic artists. On recommendation of Charlier, who has had previous dealings with the publisher, the catalog was legally, but temporarily, housed at the French publishing house of the Hachette group, who for the occasion established the equally temporary EDI-3-BD imprint, though making use of Koralle&#x27;s infrastructure – allowed to continue to exist for the time being by Axel Springer – in regard to printing and distribution. As impromptu publisher, EDI-3-BD published around two dozen album titles, including &quot;La longue marche&quot;, before turning the copyrights of these over to Novedi, which started publishing themselves in 1981. EDI-3-BD published their books for Belgium and the Netherlands themselves, but farmed out licenses for other countries, including France somewhat surprisingly, where Giraud&#x27;s former alma mater and Hachette competitor Fleurus firstly became the album publisher for &quot;La longue marche&quot;. After Novedi had become operational, the business model was adopted by them and it was decided to continue with Giraud&#x27;s other alma mater Hachette for France with the subsequent titles in the &quot;Blueberry&quot; (and other) series in recognition of the help Édi-Monde had provided. Hachette incidentally, later acquired a special, one-time-only license from Dargaud to reissue the entirety of the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series in 2013-2014 as the 52 volume &quot;La Collection Blueberry&quot; anthology, each volume augmented with a six-page illustrated editorial.

For a decade &quot;Blueberry&quot; resided in calm waters at Novedi. The 1980s saw three additions to the main series (completing the &quot;Rehabilitation&quot; story arc) as well as four new titles in the newly created &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; series. Nevertheless, despite the two &quot;Blueberry&quot; incarnations and &quot;Jeremiah&quot; being the top selling series for the publisher, it appeared that the financial base was too narrow for even a publisher the modest size of Novedi, as the publisher went out of business in 1990, after having published approximately 120 album titles, and despite having taken over the book publications for France themselves as well in the latter half of the decade. It again left &quot;Blueberry&quot; and the others without a publishing home.

====Death of a creator (1989)====

On 10 July 1989, Jean-Michel Charlier passed away from a heart condition after a short illness. By all accounts Charlier had been a workaholic throughout his career, working simultaneously on as much as a dozen projects at any given time, steadily increasing his workload as he grew older. His heart condition had already troubled him in his later years and his death, while sudden, was not entirely a surprise. Charlier&#x27;s penchant for hard work increasingly became a concern for Giraud when he visited his longtime co-worker six months before his death: &quot;He was a work bulimic! There were always seven to eight scenarios underway. His life was a true path of self-destruction. You should have seen him working at his desk! Six months before his passing, I advised him to slow down. Very artistically, he replied: &quot;No, I have chosen this!&quot;&quot;

Charlier, having been of a previous generation, conservative in nature and wary of science fiction in general, had never understood what his younger colleague tried to achieve as &quot;Mœbius&quot;. Nonetheless, he never tried to hinder Giraud in the least, as he understood that an artist of Giraud&#x27;s caliber needed a &quot;mental shower&quot; from time to time. Furthermore, Charlier was very appreciative of the graphic innovations Giraud ported over from his work as &quot;Mœbius&quot; into the mainstream &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, most specifically &quot;Nez Cassé&quot;, making him &quot;one of the all-time greatest artists in the comic medium&quot;, as Charlier himself worded it in 1982. Artist , who was taken on by Giraud in 1980 for the inks of &quot;La longue marche&quot; (&quot;The Long March&quot;) painted a slightly different picture though. Already recognizing that the two men were living in different worlds, he noted that Charlier was not pleased with Giraud taking on an assistant, afraid that it might have been a prelude to him leaving the series in order to pursue his &quot;experimentations&quot; as Mœbius further. Even Giraud was in later life led to believe that Charlier apparently &quot;detested&quot; his other work, looking upon it as something akin to &quot;treason&quot;, though his personal experiences with the author was that he had kept an &quot;open mind&quot; in this regard, at least in his case. While Charlier was willing to overlook Giraud&#x27;s wanderings in his case only, he was otherwise of the firm conviction that artists, especially his own, should totally and wholeheartedly devote themselves to their craft – as Charlier always had considered the comic medium – but which was somewhat incongruous on his part as he himself was habitually engaged in several divergent projects at any given time. This has caused many of his artists problems on a frequent basis, as he was consistently and notoriously late with his piecemeal provided script pages, including Giraud at the start of his &quot;Blueberry&quot; career. However, as he recognized quite early on that &quot;Blueberry&quot; occupied a special place in his body of work, he later made sure that (only) his &quot;Blueberry&quot; artists were provided with scripts in a timely fashion. Charlier&#x27;s method of working came at a cost, as his scripts frequently contained continuity errors on the detail level, and which included those of &quot;Blueberry&quot;, such as in his above cited instance of his hero&#x27;s first name. Charlier has cited the &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles &quot;La mine de l&#x27;allemand perdu&quot; (&quot;The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Mine&quot;) through &quot;L&#x27;homme qui valait 500 000 $&quot; (&quot;The Half-a-Million Dollar Man&quot;) as his favorites for their &quot;potency&quot;, both story and artwise, the latter making him the co-winner of his 1973 American comic award.

The script being one-thirds ready at the time of Charlier&#x27;s passing, the completion of &quot;Arizona Love&quot; was postponed as Giraud needed time to come to terms with that fact. Due to his intimate twenty-five year familiarity with both the series and its writer, it was a foregone conclusion that Giraud would from then on take on the scripting of the main series as well, especially since it was already agreed upon in the &quot;contracts signed with Jean-Michel&quot; that &quot;the survivor would take over the series&quot;. It was this circumstance that has led Philippe Charlier, son of the deceased author and now the heir and steward of his father&#x27;s &quot;bande dessinée&quot; legacy, to make the unsubstantiated claim that Novedi was surreptitiously negotiating with Giraud only for the existing and future &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, intent on cutting the Charlier family out, which was incongruous as Novedi was already heading toward receivership, aside from the fact that Giraud has never even hinted at such alleged dealings and that not a single corroborating rumor has ever surfaced elsewhere in the otherwise tight-knit Franco-Belgian comic community, save for the claim Charlier Jr. himself made on that sole occasion in the comic journal &quot;BoDoï&quot; (issue 24, 1999). Furthermore, per French law, Charlier&#x27;s widow Christine remained entitled to 10 percent of the revenues from the existing and subsequent post-Charlier &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles, which provided her with a &quot;decent&quot; living standard, according to son Philippe, effectively contradicting his own claim on the very same occasion. As for Giraud, having to work without a safety net for the first time, came initially with bouts of self-doubt and second-guessing, as Colin Wilson (by then the new &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; artist) testified to, after a visit to Giraud in this period: &quot; and I visited Jean when he was working on &quot;Arizona Love&quot; – around May 1989 [sic.] I think. Some of the first pages he showed us then were radically different from the ones ultimately published in the album later on. I did not had the time to read the scripts for those pages he had shown us, but I know that Jean redid several pages entirely anew, before the album was eventually released&quot;. The by Giraud rejected pages were published as a bonus in the 1995 deluxe limited edition of &quot;Mister Blueberry&quot;, a joint publication of Dargaud and Giraud&#x27;s publishing house Stardom.

Stunned by the sudden death of his longtime co-worker, it took Giraud nearly five years before he could bring himself to embark on &quot;Blueberry&quot; again as artist, after completing &quot;Arizona Love&quot;. Giraud stated that the series had lost its &quot;father&quot;, and that the &quot;mother needed time to mourn&quot;.

====Continued publishing wanderings (1990–1993)====
Charlier&#x27;s death coincided by chance with the growing problems at Novedi, and Giraud suggested to Philippe Charlier, the heir and steward of his father&#x27;s legacy, to move all his fathers co-creations to Les Humanoïdes Associés (with whom Giraud maintained close personal and creative ties after his &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; days – which had included &quot;Nez Cassé&quot; – among others by having them publish his acclaimed &quot;L&#x27;Incal&quot; series), to step up to the plate vacated by Novedi. Yet, Giraud undertook no further action himself, partly because he was still residing in the United States, too preoccupied with his own projects and the wrapping up of his affairs over there before his return to France (and thus too busy to be engaged in secret negotiations with Novedi), and partly because his marriage to his first wife Claudine was in the early stages of falling apart at the time. Charlier Jr. approached Fabrice Giger, who had bought the by Giraud co-founded publisher previously in early 1989, but did not choose for that publishing house eventually, but rather go with Giger&#x27;s original, founding publishing house, Alpen Publishers, the latter had set up in 1988 in Switzerland – even though comic artists themselves, due to the close entanglement of Alpen and Humanoïdes, always referred to Alpen as &quot;Humanos&quot; (&quot;see quote boxes below&quot;). It turned out that Philippe was actually picking up where his father had left off. Around the time he had established Alpen and unbeknownst to Giraud, Giger was already approached by Charlier Sr. in 1988. The veteran Charlier had already sensed the writings on the wall at Novedi and discussed plans with Giger to have &quot;all&quot; his comic creations moved over to the new publisher, arguably the very reason for the then 23-year old Giger to set up Alpen in the first place, and had to this end already arranged his old friend from his &quot;Pilote&quot; days to be hired as editor-in-chief at the new publisher, incidentally in the process doing exactly what his son would later accuse Giraud/Novedi of. Giger disclosed in 2008 that it was on the occasion of his subsequent dealings with Philippe that the &quot;JMC Aventures&quot; foundation was established, intended to safeguard the commercial and artistic legacy of Charlier&#x27;s body of work. Giger stated: &quot;After the death of Jean-Michel, a project was born between his son, Philippe, his mother, and us, to create a structure dedicated to the continuation of the series co-created by Charlier, JMC Aventures. We were shareholders with the Charlier family&quot;, confirming the preliminary dealings with the author in his final year.

The relatively short tenure at Alpen saw the release of &quot;Arizona Love&quot;, which was actually started under the aegis of Novedi, but for which Charlier had not yet contracted with the publisher because of his hunch, thus leaving the title legally &quot;free&quot; for JMC Aventures to be signed with Alpen, according to Giger, adding that this had the &quot;full and immediate blessing&quot; from Giraud. The artist himself though, taken completely unawares and having had little choice in the matter, has later expressed a slightly different opinion, where it was implied that he was not as happy with the behind-the-scenes machinations as Giger made it out to be, especially since his late script partner had kept him out of the loop in 1988. Ironically, it was Philippe Charlier himself who indirectly conceded that particular point when he accused Giraud of wanting &quot;to settle scores&quot; with Charlier Sr. with the later &quot;OK Corral&quot;-cycle, which Philippe had issues with (see &quot;below&quot;). Additional Alpen releases included the &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; title &quot;Trois hommes pour Atlanta&quot;, as well as the inception of the spin-off series &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; with two titles, aside from additions to the &quot;Les Gringos&quot; and &quot;Redbeard&quot; series, taken over by other artists after both Jijé and Charlier Sr. had passed away. While the initial intention was to have the entire body of work of Charlier published at Alpen, the corporation with the publisher did not pan out for undisclosed reasons – though Giger had mentioned increasingly difficult copyright negotiations with other copyright holders, predominantly heirs of other artists who had worked with Charlier, the widow of Jijé in particular, who had successfully taken Giger and Charlier Jr. to court. The relationship was ended in 1992, shortly thereafter followed by the demise of Alpen itself in 1994 with Guy Vidal moving over, or rather returning, to Dargaud (having taken on the writing for &quot;Les Gringos&quot; after his friend&#x27;s death, until his own death in 2002), though Giger himself became successful with Humanoïdes, expanding into the United States as &quot;Humanoids Publishing Ltd.&quot; in 1999, in the process reissuing much of Giraud&#x27;s &quot;Mœbius&quot; science fiction work.

As Belgian publisher Dupuis had already shown interest, when they serialized &quot;La dernière carte&quot; in their &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine in 1983, Charlier Jr. now decided to try his luck at that publishing house in 1992, as Hermann had already done previously with his &quot;Jeremiah&quot; for that matter. While &quot;Jeremiah&quot; has remained with Dupuis ever since, for again unknown reasons the cooperation with &quot;Blueberry&quot; did not seem to pan out either. Even though Dupuis did reissue all the &quot;(Young) Blueberry&quot; titles of the EDI-3-BD/Novedi era (but none from Alpen Publishers, or indeed any of the other Charlier creations) under its own imprint in their &quot;Repérages&quot; collection, no new titles were released during the equally short 1992-1993 tenure of &quot;Blueberry&quot; at that publisher.

====Return to the parent publisher (1993–present)====

Tiring of Giraud&#x27;s inaction, Philippe Charlier ultimately took matters into his own hand, and had all his father&#x27;s co-creations return to parent publisher Dargaud at the end of 1993 without apparent objections from Giraud (though he had stipulated an exemption for non-comic &quot;Blueberry&quot; art, produced either on personal title and/or for his own publishing houses Gentiane/Aedena, Starwatcher Graphics, and Stardom – &quot;see below&quot;), and it is there where &quot;Blueberry&quot; has remained ever since. The for Dargaud joyous occasion of now having acquired the copyrights of &quot;all&quot; &quot;Blueberry&quot; comic incarnations, was reason enough to ask Giraud – now serving as the sole main series artist – to embark on a new story-arc, which eventually resulted in the &quot;OK Corral&quot; cycle, the last one of the main series as it turned out to be. How thrilled Dargaud was to have reacquired &quot;Blueberry&quot; was amply demonstrated – aside from their decision to revitalize the serialized pre-publication format for &quot;Blueberry&quot; as already mentioned – in the 2000 documentary &quot;Mister Gir &amp; Mike S. Blueberry&quot; made on the occasion of the release of &quot;Geronimo l&#x27;Apache&quot;, in which instances were shown of the considerable marketing efforts the publisher undertook in order to promote the new album – the documentary therefore itself one such instance – among others by having many Parisian metro stations plastered with huge &quot;Blueberry&quot; posters. Aside from this, Dargaud made use of the opportunity to clean up the by then muddied release chronology, by formalizing the establishment of the three series and restarting the album numbering for each in reprint runs. Concurrently, all international licenses were renegotiated.

Apart from foreign language publishers and constituting a break in tradition, Dargaud also started to occasionally farm out special, one-time only, series licenses to other Francophone publishers, which besides the aforementioned 2013/14 with editorial pages enhanced all-series &quot;La Collection Blueberry&quot; from Hachette, already included the French book club &quot;&quot; for its 2003 main series releases. Another Francophone publisher who was granted a special license for the main series only was the French-Belgian newspaper &quot;Le Soir&quot; who released its &quot;Blueberry Intégrale&quot; in two editions, the fifteen-volume edition of 2009, and the sixteen-volume edition of 2015. Like the &quot;France Loisirs&quot; release, each volume, save three in the end, collected two of the original albums and was only offered to newspaper readers and subscribers. The three single album volumes (No&#x27;s 8, 15 and 16) were augmented with new &quot;Blueberry&quot; art, featured in a separate section and separately negotiated for with Giraud&#x27;s own publisher, Mœbius Production. Nor were the one-time only special licenses limited to Francophone publishers alone; twice Italian &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; newspaper acquired one as well for their 2014/16 overall genre 90-volume softcover &quot;Collana Western&quot; (encompassing 51 titles of the three &quot;Blueberry&quot; series), and their 2022/23 &quot;Blueberry&quot;-specific 54-volume hardcover followup &quot;Collana Blueberry&quot; releases – though in both cases lacking the editorials. A similar license has followed suit when one was extended to Spanish publisher Planeta DeAgostini, in conjuncture with partwork specialist , for their 2017/19 54-volume &quot;Blueberry Edición Coleccionista&quot;, very similar in concept to the earlier Hachette collection, but with the editorials written by Spanish comics author/historian Jorge Garcia. In a very rare case of cross-fertilization, Altaya started in 2021 to release an into French translated version of the &quot;Edición Coleccionista&quot; on the French home market as the &quot;Edition Collector&quot;, at a time when reprint runs of individual titles were all but terminated on the home market for reasons explained below.

Jean-Michel Charlier has never witnessed the return of his creations to the parent publisher, nor has he ever mended fences with George Dargaud – for whose publishing house Charlier had made signature contributions after all – and who followed Charlier in death almost to the day one year later on July 18, 1990. To a large extent the publication wanderings of &quot;Blueberry&quot; has been mirrored in other European countries as well, particularly in Germany (where the era was referred to as &quot;Der &#x27;heimatlose&#x27; Blueberry&quot; – &quot;The &#x27;homeless&#x27; Blueberry&quot;) and the Scandinavian countries (the Danes referring to the era as &quot;Blueberrys Lange March&quot; – &quot;Blueberry&#x27;s Long March&quot;), where every publisher change was followed suit by similar changes among local publishers in those territories as well. How confusing this era had been, was exemplified by the aforementioned &quot;La longue marche&quot; title, which has been released in French by no less than six publishers in the time period 1980–2003, or even seven, if one is to include the &quot;Super As&quot; serialized magazine publication as well.

Though the 2007 &quot;Apaches&quot; title became the last in the main &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, as creating comics became increasingly difficult for Giraud because his eyesight started to fail him in his last years, he did continue to create single-piece &quot;Blueberry&quot; art on larger canvases on either commission basis (such as for the aforementioned &quot;Le Soir&quot; editions) or under the aegis of Mœbius Production until his own death in 2012, much of which sold for considerable prices from 2005 onward, alongside older original &quot;Blueberry&quot; art Giraud still had in his possession, in specialized comic auctions at such auction houses like Artcurial, Hôtel Drouot and Millon &amp; Associés.

====The commemorative omnibus collection series (2012–2019)====

Shortly after Jean Giraud had died on 10 March 2012 as well, Dargaud embarked in November that year on the release of the &quot;Blueberry&quot; main series 9-volume &quot;Intégrale&quot; anthology/omnibus collection, completed in December 2019. Though there had been several (international) &quot;Intégrale&quot; versions released before, this version, each volume collecting either three or four individual volumes of the main series, was intended to become the definitive one and each volume was greatly enhanced with elaborate and richly illustrated editorials, written by France&#x27;s preeminent comics scholars such as , or Gilles Ratier, among others. It quickly evolved into an international release as it has by 2023 become translated into Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, (Brazilian) Portuguese, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, and Swedish. Launched in 2019, the German and Danish editions were remarkable in this respect in that these countries had already seen their aforementioned and relatively recent 2006-2011/17 Egmont omnibus editions (which had themselves already been quite elaborate as well), constituting an enduring testament to the continuing popularity of Giraud&#x27;s &quot;Blueberry&quot; in those countries, Germany in particular.

It turned out a half year later that such a collection had already been in the works in conjuncture with Giraud himself prior to his death, but not as a general release as eventually realized, but rather as a to 10–12,000 copies one-time-only limited &quot;collector&#x27;s edition&quot; Francophone market exclusive. As Dargaud deputy manager Philippe Ostermann had explained in the quote box on the right, an economic necessity for a general intégrale release had not yet materialized by the time Giraud died. After Giraud&#x27;s death though and pursuant securing the blessings of both his and Charlier&#x27;s heirs, it was decided with the upcoming fiftieth anniversary of the series in mind to turn the project into a general release after all, which effectively terminated the reprint runs of the individual volumes of the main series in each of the language territories where the collection was released, save for the aforementioned unique special license releases – in some countries, such as Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden, individual volume reprint runs of the main series had already been suspended indefinitely long before the release in those territories of the intégrale edition. The German edition of the collection, carries the subtitle &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, as a reminder of the original intent of the collection, aside from distinguishing it from their Egmont edition. However though, and just as had been the case with the Egmont edition (see &quot;below&quot;), a glaring omission in the Dargaud collection remained the &quot;Three Black Birds&quot; short story, excepting a single page for illustrative purposes in the editorial of volume 8 only. That Isabelle Giraud had chosen not sign off on the collection publication of that story as a whole had everything to do with the intense, below-explained animosity she harbored towards Philippe Charlier.

In 2017, a &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; intégrale, collecting the three individual volumes of the intermezzo mini-series, was additionally released by Dargaud, likewise seeing several international translations. Though similarly executed, it was not released as part of 2012 intégrale series, but rather as a stand-alone, or Hors Séries (HS – &quot;outside the series&quot;), release. Furthermore, it also lacked any editorials – which ironically made the earlier corresponding Egmont release from 2006 the superior one, as that volume did feature editorials.

===English translations===
The first known English translation of &quot;Blueberry&quot; was that of the first title &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, and appeared 18 months after its original 1963 French magazine publication and before its first album publication in September 1965. The first outing in the series was serialized in syndication through Charlier&#x27;s own EdiFrance/EdiPresse agency (albeit on behalf of his employer Dargaud and the only &quot;Blueberry&quot; title known to have been disseminated in this manner outside Francophone Europe, Spain and Portugal) under its original title in the weekly British comic magazine &quot;Valiant&quot;, starting its edited and truncated black and white run in issue 15 May 1965 through issue 21 August 1965, fifteen issues in total. Together with the near-simultaneous and similar publication of the story in Dutch (in full and in color in &quot;Fix en Fox&quot; magazine, issues 26-41, 1965), both actually stand out as the first known non-French publications of &quot;Blueberry&quot;, or of any other work by Giraud (but not Charlier) for that matter. However, the growing popularity of the comic elsewhere in Europe from 1967 onward notwithstanding, the Netherlands included, &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; remained until 1977 the only &quot;Blueberry&quot; title translated in English.

The first four English album translations of Blueberry comics were published in Europe for release in the UK in the late seventies by Danish/British joint venture Egmont/Methuen, when Egmont, holding an international license at the time, was in the process of releasing the series on a wider, international scale, for Germany and the Scandinavian countries in particular. While Egmont completed the publication of the then existing series in whole for the latter two language areas, publication of the English titles already ceased after volume 4. Parent publisher Dargaud had planned to reissue these titles and more in translation for the North-American market in 1982/83 through their short-lived Dargaud International Publishing, Ltd. Canadian branch, but of these, only one was eventually released. That then unnoticed title, &quot;The Man with the Silver Star&quot;, has, despite the fact that Giraud&#x27;s art style had by now fully blossomed into his distinctive own, not been included in later North American collections, resulting in the album becoming an expensive rarity.
Since then better marketed English translations were published by other companies which included Marvel Comics (under its Epic imprint), Comcat, Mojo Press and Dark Horse Comics, resulting in all kinds of formats and quality—from b/w, American comic book sized budget collections to full color European graphic novel style albums with many extras. Actually this was the first time &quot;Blueberry&quot; was published under Giraud&#x27;s pseudonym, Moebius. As Randy and Jean-Marc Lofficier, the translator couple for &quot;all&quot; these editions, related: &quot;This is quite ironic because Giraud first coined the &#x27;Moebius&#x27; pseudonym precisely because he wanted to keep his two bodies of work separate. Yet, the artist recognizes the fact that he has now become better known in this country under his &#x27;nom-de-plume&#x27; and this is his way of making it official!&quot; In effect, the ploy was more than opportune, as Epic had already started out with the publication of Giraud&#x27;s better known science fiction work under his pseudonym – introduced to American readership through &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; in the mid-1970s – in the graphic novel format, and it was only when these were well underway that it was decided to add &quot;Blueberry&quot; as well to the array. All Giraud/Moebius titles were released by Epic in a for the US relatively modest print run of 20.000 copies per title. To make the project as economically viable as possible, it was decided to collect two of the original &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles in one book, to justify the by Americans perceived high price of around US$13, which, excepting the first two titles of the &quot;Iron Horse&quot; story-arc, made the Epic releases in essence &quot;intégrales&quot; themselves. Giraud conceded that the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, due to the sharply diminished interest in the Western genre in the country at the time and contrary to his similarly released Sci-Fi and fantasy work as Mœbius by Epic, were very slow sellers in the US, though the entire printing did manage to eventually sell out over the years. In addition to citing the Americans&#x27; complete and absolute obsession with the &quot;Superhero&quot; genres, Giraud has also remarked a few years later, &quot;One cannot say that the results were all that convincing. Jean-Marc Lofficier did of course a fine job in convincing Marvel to reissue &quot;Blueberry&quot; in the States, but it was above all a matter of prestige. In hindsight, I think today that it might have stood a better chance if the &quot;Blueberry&quot; plates had seen daily publication in the pages of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; or &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, which is of course a perfectly utopian notion. The recognition of all the work signed with &quot;Mœbius&quot; on the other hand, is total.&quot;

It was for Epic that Giraud created new &quot;Blueberry&quot; book cover art (which he had only done once previously for the first four German album releases by Koralle, nor would he ever again), and to the chagrin of parent publisher Dargaud this art – as is indeed all outside the main comics proper &quot;Blueberry&quot; art, such as magazine covers, art portfolios, posters and the like, that Giraud created in this period of time for Koralle, Les Humanoïdes Associés, as well as his own publishing houses Gentiane, Starwatcher Graphics, Stardom and the subsequent Moebius Production remain outside the legal purview of Dargaud, even after they had reacquired the &quot;Blueberry&quot; copyrights in 1993. In practice this means that Dargaud can not use this art at will for their own later publications, such as the 2012 anthology releases, without coming to some sort of legal and financial arrangement with the copyright holders – &quot;i.e.&quot; Giraud himself in the vast majority of cases (as of 2012, his heirs and with whom Dargaud apparently had, as some non-Dargaud controlled art has been published in the last three volumes of the 2012 anthology release) – as Dargaud licensees have to do as well on individual basis, and of which the short story &quot;Three Black Birds&quot; is the most glaring and, for fans, the most painful one (&quot;see below&quot; – Dargaud had only been able to secure a few excerpts for publication in the eighth volume of their 2012 release). German author Martin Jürgeit (co-author of the below-listed reference book) has confirmed being confronted with this when he served as editor-in-chief for the German-language version of Egmont&#x27;s earlier mentioned anthology collection. Dead set on having &quot;all&quot; available &quot;Blueberry&quot; material included in his version, he found himself frequently frustrated in this regard on more than one occasion. He stated as late as 2012: &quot;As things now stand, it is highly unlikely that the vast majority of this material will be included, as Dargaud does not own the copyrights. And it is only the Dargaud copyrighted material we can use for the &quot;Blueberry-Chroniken&quot;, as we have experienced to our dismay on several occasions&quot;, referring among others, aside from &quot;Three Black Birds&quot;, to the covers for Epic as well. On the other hand, Jürgeit was allowed to incorporate all &quot;Blueberry&quot; art Giraud had created exclusively for Koralle, which Dargaud was not for their 2012 release.

The Epic publications were very shortly after their initial release collected by American specialty publisher Graphitti Designs in their &quot;Moebius&quot; collection – for whom Giraud created new book plate art, also outside the legal purview of Dargaud – a deluxe limited edition anthology collection, released in a 1500 copies per volume edition, each volume at least containing two of the Epic releases. The collection, which ran for nine volumes, also contained Giraud&#x27;s science fiction body of work, that was concurrently released by Epic in a similar manner. Volume &quot;Moebius #9&quot;, containing &quot;The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Mine&quot; and &quot;The Ghost with the Golden Bullets&quot;, also included the non-&quot;Blueberry&quot; westerns &quot;King of the Buffalo&quot; (short), and the other Giraud/Charlier western strip, &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot;: &quot;Mississippi River&quot;. Excepting the 1996 Mojo Press release, no additional &quot;Blueberry&quot; comics have been published in English since 1993, and, again excepting the Mojo Press release, no English &quot;Blueberry&quot; reprints have seen the light of day either, contrary to his other work as &quot;Moebius&quot;.

The Epic collection earned Giraud his below listed American 1991 comic award, augmented with an additional 1997 award nomination for the Mojo Press release, whereas &quot;Blueberry&quot; in general had already earned him two American comic awards in 1972 and 1973, long before the series had even come to the attention of North-American readership.
*1 According to Bedetheque.com, the French albums were until volume 18 published in simultaneous conjuncture with Belgian publisher Le Lombard who released these for French-Belgium, initially as soft cover editions, contrary to Dargaud who released these from the start as hard cover albums. The same also held true for the first three &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; titles, then part of the main series. For expedience sake only the French editions from the parent publisher are mentioned. ISBNs were not issued until 1975, the Lombard releases actually never receiving any.
*2 The 2007 one-shot &quot;Apaches&quot; is an edited album collecting the flashback recollections Blueberry related from &quot;Ombres sur Tombstone&quot; through &quot;Dust&quot; to a journalist while convalescing from a gunshot wound he had sustained in the preceding story, detailing how he, after the war and suffering from a severe case of post traumatic stress syndrome, arrives in the South West in late autumn 1865, and his subsequent dealings with Apache warrior Goyaałé, before the latter came to national attention as Geronimo. There it was revealed that it had been Geronimo who had given Blueberry his Native-American nickname &quot;Tsi-Na-Pah&quot; (&quot;Broken Nose&quot;). For the album Giraud created new pages and panels to improve the flow of the story, and as such the album is readable as a stand-alone prequel title. Notable are the new, last two pages which shows Blueberry leaving his first Far West posting, while wearing the outfit, he is first seen in, in &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, his second posting, providing a seamless continuity (even though Giraud &quot;had&quot; made a continuity error as one of the panels featured a tombstone engraved with 1881, the year in which the &quot;OK Corral&quot; story arc, centered around the historical &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; incident, was set). While the French themselves consider the album outside the main series (&quot;Hors-Séries&quot;, the &quot;HS&quot; or &quot;0&quot;-volume) due to the prequel nature of the album story, it is otherwise universally considered part of the main series as volume 29 in other countries.
*3 IPC Magazines did not employ numbering for their magazine publications at the time, including &quot;Valiant&quot;.
*4 The failure to publish &quot;La piste des Navajos&quot; in the English language, frustratingly left English readers with an unresolved cliffhanger, as it was the resolution of a five volume story arc that started with &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;. As of 2025, only foreign language editions have been available to them.
*5 In 2020, the entirety of the main (including &quot;Trail of the Navajo&quot; and &quot;Three Black Birds&quot;), &quot;Young Blueberry&quot;, and &quot;Mister Blueberry&quot; series, saw an English language softcover album release by the independent micro publisher &quot;Tom Is Jerry Books&quot;. A non-profit organization based out of Munich, Germany. The publisher publishes since 2020 the triannual &quot;Pingo Magazine&quot; that specializes in contemporary art and mindfulness, with European comics, including &quot;Blueberry&quot;, as recent &quot;Pingo Magazine&quot; &quot;special edition&quot; additions of interest. German and English are chosen as lingua franca for the (print-on-demand-only) albums, but are exclusively sold on an extremely limited basis through some online, museum, and art bookstores in a few selected western European cities with the single New York City, US, bookstore Printed Matter, Inc., as the only one located in an English-language territory.
*6 While it is above stated by Lofficier that &quot;Blueberry&quot; is not about a handsome cowboy who &quot;rides into town, saves the ranch, becomes the new sheriff and marries the schoolmarm&quot;, the sixth, stand-alone title &quot;The Man with the Silver Star&quot; is ironically exactly that. Moreover, the story was clearly a take on Howard Hawk&#x27;s classic 1959 Western &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;, a circumstance not lost on the passionate Western fan Giraud, who confronted Charlier with the similarities: &quot;I have never understood why Charlier has written it. I talked to him about it, but it seemed he was not aware of it; he has never been one for cinema. He must have had unconsciously remembered the movie, and apparently completely suppressed the memory of it. You know, these things happen, and one can not automatically assume plagiarism. As the theme of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; is so incredibly strong, it is hard to forget, even if you have forgotten the movie itself&quot;. Giraud paid homage to the movie by having the main cast appear in a few background cameos. The assertions of Giraud notwithstanding, the potential for plagiarism allegations explained why this title was left out by Epic for their series publication, despite the already mentioned fact that Giraud&#x27;s art style was by now fully his own. Still, &quot;The Man with the Silver Star&quot; has remained the only &quot;Blueberry&quot; title purely patterned after the template as set by the classic American Western genre.
*7 As the title already suggested, &quot;The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Mine&quot; was a take on the real world &quot;Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Gold Mine legend&quot;, and in the original publications the Lückner and &quot;Prosit&quot; characters were from Prussia as specifically intended by Charlier, and as indicated by the &quot;Allemand&quot; (French for &quot;German&quot;) reference in the French album title, therefore adhering to the actual legend in this respect. Translator Lofficier chose the for Americans familiar-sounding name of the real legend as title for the American book release, but changed the characters to being denizens from the Netherlands, in the process changing the original expletives from German to Dutch in his translations, aside from altering the German name spellings accordingly. Though Lofficier, married to a US citizen, had worked for decades in the US in the publishing world, acquiring an excellent knowledge of American English and idiom, he had made a mistake when he interpreted the moniker &quot;Dutch&quot; as currently – &quot;and&quot; originally – understood, too literally – as in from/of the Netherlands. Being of French descent, Lofficier had not realized that in the United States of the mid-to-late 19th century, the expression &quot;Dutch&quot; has had a different meaning (Charlier, who &quot;was&quot; aware of this, had by that time already passed away, and thus unable to set Lofficier straight), as it was by Americans invariably employed to refer to people and language of German descent/origin, due to the massive influx of German speaking immigrants in that period of time. These immigrants referred to themselves as &quot;Deutch&quot; in their own language, and the phonetic similarity is the more commonly accepted rationale for the phenomenon, and it was not until the turn of the century that &quot;Dutch&quot; regained its original meaning. The phenomenon has not applied for Canada.
*8 In the case of Epic&#x27;s &quot;Chihuahua Pearl&quot;, &quot;Ballad for a Coffin&quot;, &quot;Angel Face&quot;, &quot;The Ghost Tribe&quot;, and &quot;The End of the Trail&quot; book releases, Titan Books has issued the same, virtually identical books (save for the ISBNs and publisher&#x27;s logo) for the UK market, with a few months delay. The other Epic &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles only saw a US release, the Titan editions thereby becoming the last British &quot;Blueberry&quot; publications. These editions were released in a relatively modest print run of 6.000 copies per title, as Giraud himself has divulged, though he has added: &quot;Mind you, British readers were delighted; As a matter of fact, they adore [continental] European comics, which we had not quite recognized over here [France] at the time...&quot;.
*9 &quot;Le hors-la-loi&quot; literally translates as &quot;&#x27;The one outside the law&quot;, in meaning exactly the same as &quot;L&#x27;outlaw&quot;. France however, is one of the few remaining European countries where the use of anglicisms is actively discouraged and combated by cultural authorities, resulting in the use of the more laborious expression as the album title.
*10 Volumes 19-21 were in France and French-Belgium simultaneously released by two different publishers, albeit under the same ISBN. The French publisher is listed first.
*11 After Blueberry&#x27;s rehabilitation in &quot;Le bout de la piste&quot;, Charlier had planned to have him return to the US Army as captain, heading a unit of Apache Scouts. After Charlier&#x27;s death, Giraud became of different mind when he embarked on the &quot;OK Corral&quot; story arc, turning the hero in to a loafing civilian, because of his new-found wealth and spending his days with poker, as he felt that it would have been too illogical and too implausible for Blueberry to return to the very same organization that had caused him so much grief and injustice.
*12 Mojo Press published a black and white, American comic book sized budget collection: &quot;The Blueberry Saga #1: The Confederate Gold&quot; in 1996. It contains the following stories: &quot;Chihuahua Pearl&quot;, &quot;The Half-A-Million Dollar Man&quot;, &quot;Ballad for a Coffin&quot;, &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, &quot;Angel Face&quot;. It also featured the first-time book publication worldwide of the 14-page &quot;Blueberry&quot; short, &quot;Three Black Birds&quot; – the year previously released under the same title as a limited edition, 28-sheet mini portfolio by Stardom, Giraud&#x27;s own publishing house – which was actually set directly after the events depicted in &quot;Arizona Love&quot;, though that title was &quot;not&quot; included in the anthology. As the title already implied, the book was coined after the actual, so-called &quot;Confederate gold myth&quot;. When introduced at the April 1996 WonderCon, copies sold at the convention came with a separate ex-libris, some of which signed by the artist. A staple in the European comic scene as a collector&#x27;s item, it was not recognized as such by contemporary American buyers who were at the time utterly unfamiliar with the phenomenon. As the ex-libris featured blown-up interior art instead of original art, many of them mistook it, the unsigned ones in particular, as a discardable commercial insert, something American (magazine) readers were &quot;very much&quot; familiar with. As a result, only a handful of copies of the ex-libris have survived, becoming therefore very rare collectibles, prized by European collectors in particular.
*13 There is a chronology gap of eight years between &quot;Arizona Love&quot; and &quot;Mister Blueberry&quot;, which was specifically intended by Giraud: &quot;&quot;Mister Blueberry&quot; takes place eight years later, which leaves room for further romantic speculations. Surely, many readers will ask themselves, what Blueberry has been up to in the intervening time&quot;. Yet, what the creators had overlooked however, was that they had made a continuity error, by placing the events in &quot;Arizona Love&quot; in 1889 in the opening panel, whereas Giraud clearly had meant 1873, amply demonstrated by him correcting the year in &quot;Three Black Birds&quot;. In later reprints corrected to &quot;late 1872&quot;, the original year mentioning had European fans initially and erroneously assuming that &quot;Arizona Love&quot; was the first part of the &quot;OK Corral&quot; story arc.
*14 When Giraud was preparing to embark on the &quot;Mister Blueberry&quot; cycle at the start of 1995, he was fully intent on making it a new spin-off series, akin to the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; or &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; series, and not as a continuation of the main series. He stated at the time, &quot;I am preparing a Blueberry as follow-up to the Fort Navajo adventures, but which will constitute a new series: &quot;Mister Blueberry&quot;. In effect, Blueberry is no longer in the army, he isn&#x27;t even a lieutenant anymore. It is quite logical for the series to change its title...&quot; Nonetheless, publisher Dargaud adamantly refused to go along with Giraud&#x27;s intent, and published the first story as volume 24 of the main series. In hindsight however, this turned out to be unexpectedly fortuitous for Giraud, as it legally prevented Charlier heir Philippe, who became opposed to the story cycle, to exercise a publication veto.

===Non-English translations===
Since its inception, the series has steadily gained a large following in Europe, and has, in part or in whole, been extensively translated in both serialized and album versions into multiple languages aside from English, to wit, Spanish (both Spain proper and the Americas), Portuguese (including Brazil), Italian, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Finnish, Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, Greek, Icelandic, Turkish, Tamil, Indonesian and, more recently, Japanese with even more recent additions in Chinese. At least one title – &quot;L&#x27;homme à l&#x27;étoile d&#x27;argent&quot; – is known to have seen a relatively recent translation in Arabic in the Egyptian weekly comic magazine &quot;New Magic Carpet&quot; (بساط الريح الجديدة), issues 1–11, 2009. In Spanish and Portuguese &quot;Blueberry&quot; has seen (licensed) publications by local publishers in the Americas, as it has in the former Yugoslavia after its disintegration into its constituent parts. In the European Union, in case of trans-border language areas, it has become customary from the mid-1980s onward, to have publishing rights reside with one publisher only. Like it was in native France, most countries have seen &quot;Blueberry&quot; pre-published in magazine serials. The Portuguese 1969 &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; publication from Editorial Íbis is the earliest known instance of a &quot;Blueberry&quot; title to be released directly as album, without prior serialized magazine pre-publication, contrary to the 1965 French and 1968 Spanish album releases, the three of them – all executed in the hard cover format incidentally, save for the French-Belgian Le Lombard release – becoming the only available album versions of the story until 1974.

Album publication of &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, because Charlier had chosen to disseminate the title outside the French, Spanish and Portuguese language areas in magazine syndication, has posed problems for publishers in other language countries, especially in Germany and north-west Europe, when &quot;Blueberry&quot; broke out in popularity in the late 1960s–early 1970s, well before the syndication term was to expire in 1974. It is not known why Charlier had chosen this format for &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, as the US derived syndication format was by that time already well on its way out for European comics, after the relative immediate post-war paper shortage was no longer an issue. Since &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; was the first part of a five album story arc, this caused continuity, or rather chronology problems as publishers were not yet able to publish the album in their countries. The respective publishers all went about the conundrum in their own way; in Germany the story was first re-serialized as a magazine publication, before continuing with the album releases of the subsequent titles; in the Netherlands and Flanders it was decided to push ahead with album publication regardless of &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, and in the Scandinavian countries it was decided to forego on the publication of the first five titles altogether for the time being, instead opting to start album publication with volume six, &quot;L&#x27;homme à l&#x27;étoile d&#x27;argent&quot;, leaving publication of the first five titles for a future point in time. No matter what solution was chosen, it became one of the reasons for the messed up album release chronologies for those countries (only aggravated by both the later addition of &quot;Young&quot;, and &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; album titles as well as the aforementioned publishing wanderings), confusing readership, especially in Germany. It was Finnish publisher Sanoma that became the first publisher able to release the first other language album edition of the title in 1974, directly after the syndication term had expired, as &quot;Navaho: Väijytys Punaisessa laaksossa&quot; (, notice the Finnish adherence to the originally intended series name, by now dropped by the parent publisher), that country&#x27;s first &quot;Blueberry&quot; album publication, thereby avoiding the conundrum. Nor had the conundrum been an issue for the UK, as album publication only started in 1977.

There actually had been two other countries, Italy and the former Yugoslavia, where &quot;Blueberry&quot; had also enjoyed an early breakout success prior to the expiration of the syndication term, each seeing its own early release of &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; in its totality, to wit the respective 1967 &quot;Classici Audacia&quot; issue 42 from Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, and the 1972 &quot;Stripoteka-Panorama&quot; issue 60 from NIP Forum publications. However, both publications were legally and technically (newsstand) magazine publications and not bonafide comic albums, and resorted therefore under the magazine syndication regime.

In the United States, California based distributor Public Square Books (currently known as Zócalo Public Square) imported &quot;Blueberry&quot; albums from Spanish publisher Norma Editorial, S.A. on behalf of the Spanish speaking part of the country. Having done so in the first half of the 2000s, these albums were endowed with American ISBNs in the form of a bar code sticker, simply put over the Spanish ISBN. For example, &quot;Arizona Love&quot; originally carried the Spanish , but once imported in the US, received the new, American . Latino-Americans therefore, have been afforded the opportunity to enjoy the then entirety of the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series (including the spin-offs), contrary to their English speaking counterparts.

Apart from Europe, the Americas, Japan, Indonesia and China, the series (or parts thereof) has been translated on the Indian subcontinent in Mizo by Mahlua of Cydit Communications, operating out of Aizawl, and in Tamil. It is in the latter language in particular, spoken in the south-eastern part of India, Tamil Nadu, and on the island state of Sri Lanka, that the &quot;Blueberry&quot; saga has amassed a large fanbase and where he is dubbed &quot;Captain Tiger&quot; (கேப்டன் டைகர்). All three series (save &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; by Corteggiani/Blanc-Dumont – see &quot;below&quot;) have been published by Prakash Publishers under their own &quot;Lion, Muthu Comics&quot; imprints. In April 2015, an exclusive collectors edition was published in Tamil, collecting &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles 13 through 22 – with &quot;Arizona Love&quot; added in first time Tamil translation – in one 540-page album. Considered a milestone release in the entire Indian comics history, as well as one of the biggest collector editions of &quot;Blueberry&quot; comics worldwide, it had already been surpassed by the time of its release by an even more massive, entire main series – save &quot;Apaches&quot; – single album original language anthology of 1456 pages by parent publisher Dargaud in the previous year.

==Prequel, intermezzo, and sequel sub-series==
A &quot;prequel&quot; series, &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; (&quot;Young Blueberry&quot;), and the &quot;intermezzo&quot; series &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; have been published as well, with other artists and writers, most famously William Vance for the latter. Despite dogged efforts on the part of Giraud, the intended &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; sequel did not come to fruition for extraneous reasons.

===Prequel: &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry (Young Blueberry)&quot;===
A later created prequel series, dealt with Blueberry&#x27;s early years, during the American Civil War, relating how the racist son of a wealthy plantation owner turned into a Yankee bugler and all the adventures after that. The material for the first three albums, conceived by the original &quot;Blueberry&quot; creators, was originally published in the 1968–1970 mass market paperback sized &quot;Super Pocket Pilote&quot; series, as in total nine 16-page short stories, eight of them constituting one story-arc set in the war. The first short story, &quot;Tonnerre sur la sierra&quot; (&quot;Thunder on the Sierra&quot;), was actually a post-war stand-alone adventure set before the events depicted in &quot;The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Mine&quot;. With the exception of the first and the last, &quot;Double jeu&quot; (&quot;Double Cross&quot;), where the coloring was taken on by Giraud himself, all other shorts were originally published in black and white.

In 1995, Giraud slightly contradicted Charlier&#x27;s birth account of &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; by divulging that he had already created the &quot;Tonnerre sur la sierra&quot; story by himself, before Charlier actually came up with the Civil War approach: &quot;It was I who scripted the first episode of &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot;. It very much resembled a regular series episode, but much smaller. Charlier subsequently presented me with another idea, the one concerning the American Civil War. I found it an excellent idea and writing started up right away&quot;.

Giraud created his &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; art with the smaller digest size format specifically in mind, and adopted therefore a more loose, less &quot;convoluted&quot; art style which allowed him to create his pages more quickly, already applying the revised technique for &quot;Tonnerre sur la sierra&quot;. Additionally, it was for these stories that he started to experiment with applying inks in pen – alongside the brush he had hitherto exclusively employed for the series – a technique he would perfect later on as &quot;Mœbius&quot;. While the resulting spontaneous art worked out fine for the smaller sized pages of &quot;Superpocket Pilote&quot;, it did suffer from the enlargement for the hereafter mentioned album releases, when compared to the larger, more detailed pages for the &quot;Pilote&quot; main series on which he concurrently continued to work. Still, the experience gained on the &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; shorts served him well, when he had to create &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; in a hurry a decade later, utilizing a similar technique.

The publication of &quot;La jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; (&quot;Blueberry&#x27;s Secret&quot;) in 1975, the first album to collect the first three shorts of the Civil War story-arc, came as a surprise to &quot;Blueberry&quot; fans. Having left &quot;Blueberry&quot; on a cliffhanger with &quot;Angel Face&quot;, when Giraud took his extended leave of absence (see above), clamor for new &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles became such, that publisher Dargaud decided to make the move as a temporary stop-gap solution. For the book publication, the original pages were blown up and by Giraud extended in width, rearranged and (re-)colored, with some panels omitted in the process to fit the then standard album format of 46 pages, when discounting the two disclaimer pages. While the removal of individual panels was regrettable from a graphic art point of view – as it, besides the missing art, also broke up the integrity of Giraud&#x27;s carefully designed page lay-outs, especially in &quot;3000 Mustangs&quot; – it entailed no consequences for the plot of the shorts, save the first one; in &quot;Blueberry&#x27;s Secret&quot; the synopsis mentioned Long Sam had witnessed the murder Blueberry was accused of and therefore able to prove his innocence, but is gunned down before he is able to do so by the real murderer, who in turn is gunned down by Blueberry, leaving Blueberry without any recourse to prove his innocence. However, for the book publication, the two panels which showed the real murderer being killed were cut, causing a discrepancy as it left readers, unfamiliar with the original publication, wondering why Blueberry was so despondent, as, from their point of view, the real killer was still alive.

The releases of the two follow-up collection albums, &quot;Un Yankee nommé Blueberry&quot; (&quot;A Yankee Named Blueberry&quot;) and &quot;Cavalier bleu&quot; (&quot;The Blue Coats&quot;), four years later (in itself an indication that Dargaud had not planned to do so initially, if only for the substantial editorial effort it took in the pre-computer era to adapt the original digest size for the standard sized comic book), turned out to be in equal measure a stop-gap initiative. Unable to resolve the royalties conflict, which had dragged on for five years, Charlier and Giraud turned their back on the parent publisher, leaving for greener pastures elsewhere and taking &quot;all&quot; of Charlier&#x27;s co-creations with them. Giraud though, conceded to do the same editorial work he did on behalf of the first album for its two follow-ups. Sensing that it might potentially turn out to be a costly defection, the two &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; titles were released to make the most of the fervor that had surrounded the return of &quot;Blueberry&quot; with &quot;Nez Cassé&quot;. For Dargaud it indeed turned out to be a costly affair as the two 1979 titles were the last new titles they were able to release for nearly fifteen years, missing out on a period of time in which &quot;Blueberry&quot; reached the pinnacle of its popularity – seeing, besides new titles in the main series, the birth of two spin-off series as well – even though the publishing rights of the older book titles remained where they were. As the &quot;Thunder on the Sierra&quot; short numbered 14 pages instead of 16, no editorial cutting was necessary for the third book. Apart from the editorial changes to fit the book format and the creation of new covers for the two additional albums, Giraud also made use of the opportunity to recreate a small number of panels to replace those he had felt unhappy about in hindsight, spread over all three albums.

Dargaud considered their three, original creator&#x27;s, &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; book titles as part of the main series, until they regained the &quot;Blueberry&quot; rights in late 1993, and as such have therefore seen translations in most of the aforementioned languages as well. Apart from the expedited release of the two additional &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; titles, Dargaud also undertook a subsequent action in an attempt to further profit from the upsurge in popularity of &quot;Blueberry&quot;, by releasing the first six-volume &quot;Blueberry&quot; integral edition of 1984. A co-production with French publisher , each of the six volumes collected four titles of the then existing main series. Rombaldi was brought into the fold to act as an intermediary in order to negotiate a separate license from Novedi to have the then four Novedi main series titles included as well in volumes 5 and 6, though Dargaud performed a copyright infraction by making sure Novedi was not mentioned as copyright holder in the respective colophons. The three &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; titles were collected in volume 6. In recognition for their assistance, Rombaldi was retained for similar releases of the two other Dargaud Western series, &#x27; (see also &quot;below&quot;) and &#x27; – each, like &quot;Blueberry&quot;, one of the &quot;big five&quot; 1970s Franco-Belgian realistic Western comics – combining all of them in one overall, eleven-volume &quot;Les géants du l&#x27;Ouest&quot; collection, as promoted in contemporary advertisements.

The 1990 English language edition of these books by Catalan Communications in their &quot;ComCat&quot; line, gave track of the changes and presented the left out panels in editorials in which Giraud himself presented clarifications for the choices made. It was in effect American readership that was first afforded a clarification for the discrepancy in the first book and the editorial changes made, before European readers were, in the editorials by Lofficier of the releases. Only these first three books were published in English. The three American albums, again translated by the Lofficier couple, were also, unaltered and unedited, included in the above-mentioned anthology collection from Graphitti Designs. The Graphitti Designs &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; anthology title differed from the others in that it was not printed on high gloss paper, but on matte paper as in the original ComCat publications, indicating that by then inclusion in the Graphitti &quot;Moebius&quot; collection was already accounted for and that the original print run of the interior pages was adjusted accordingly.


====Change of artist (I)====

After &quot;Angel Face&quot; was completed in 1974, Giraud took an extended leave of absence from &quot;Blueberry&quot;, because he wanted further explore and develop his &quot;Moebius&quot; alter ego, the work he produced as such being published in &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; magazine, in the process revolutionizing the Franco-Belgian world of &quot;bandes dessinées&quot;. Having ended &quot;Angel Face&quot; on a cliffhanger, Giraud&#x27;s return to &quot;Blueberry&quot; five years later with &quot;Broken Nose&quot; became a media event of considerable proportions and demand for &quot;Blueberry&quot; reached an all-time high. It was then that the creators decided to revisit the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; adventures as well, which had ended its run in &quot;Super Pocket Pilote&quot;. Giraud was nowhere near able to take on yet another major series himself, as he was still working on his &quot;Incal&quot; series as Moebius, besides having embarked on &quot;Blueberry&quot; again.

There actually had been an additional, more prosaic reason as well for the decision to do so. After Giraud had finished &quot;La dernière carte&quot; he, having been very much invested throughout most of his adult life in New Age beliefs and practices (which included the use of mind-expanding substances), had already left for Tahiti to join the commune of mystic Jean-Paul Appel-Guéry, the latter had set up there. After a stay of nearly two years, Giraud moved to the United States in late 1984 and set up shop firstly in Santa Monica, and subsequently in Venice and Woodland Hills, California. It was in this era that his work was published by Marvel/Epic for the US market. Publisher Novedi feared, not entirely unjustified – as the release lag between two titles had already increased from eighteen months to three years – that it endangered the publication regularity of the main series, and resurrecting, or more accurately, creating the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; series, was the back-up strategy they had in mind. Novedi had solid reasons to do so, as any new &quot;Blueberry&quot; title in that particular period of time enjoyed an (all-language) European first print run of 500.000 copies – thus discounting any later reprint run – for European standards a very respectable print run.

Publisher and creators subsequently embarked on a search for a suitable artist to take on the task. It was then that fate intervened when Giraud, before his departure to Tahiti, discovered the work of the still unknown ex-pat Colin Wilson from New Zealand, who was publishing a science fiction comic series &quot;Dans l&#x27;Ombre du Soleil&quot; – for which Wilson did both the writing and the art – for the French &quot;Circus&quot; comic magazine, which featured the character &quot;Raël&quot; (also the first story title) that shared a stunning resemblance with Blueberry. Wilson was actually a huge Giraud fan himself and had modeled his &quot;Raël&quot; character after a Western hero he had created for the New Zealand fanzine &quot;Strips&quot;, and who in turn was modeled after Blueberry. Ironically in hindsight, it were the original black &amp; white &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; shorts that introduced Wilson to &quot;Blueberry&quot; as some &quot;Super Pilote Pocket&quot; issues had somehow found their to way to New Zealand, then a country without a comic tradition to speak of, according to Wilson. His admiration for Franco-Belgian &quot;bande dessinée&quot; artists, Giraud in particular, became in 1980 the driving force for Wilson to try his luck as such in Europe, aside from the fact that his native country did not afford any opportunities to become one professionally. Wilson reiterated in 1986: &quot;Those drawings of Giraud convinced me to leave New Zealand. If that&#x27;s what European comics are like then I wanted to be a part of it&quot;. It was comic artist François Corteggiani who brought Wilson to the attention of Giraud by sending him a few pages of the &quot;Raël&quot; comic, and who in turn brought them to the attention of his co-worker Charlier (or vice versa as sources are not in concordance with each other).

Unaware that his work was already brought to the attention of his idol and &quot;his&quot; co-worker, Corteggiani arranged Wilson&#x27;s first face-to-face meeting with them in September 1983 in Paris. Wilson said: &quot;To have a discussion with Giraud, what a chance! That&#x27;s why I immediately said yes to François Corteggiani&quot;. Much to his own surprise, Wilson was almost immediately asked if he was interested to take on the new &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; series. After having accepted, he developed a close and warm working relationship with Charlier, and the Wilson/ couple befriended both him and his wife Christine, with household visits back and forth. The Charlier couple not only helped their friends (neither of them French-speaking and staying on a tourist visa in Amsterdam at the time) to settle firstly in Brussels, Belgium, and subsequently in the Provence, France, but with practical work details as well, as Wilson later recalled: &quot;Janet and I were tremendously lucky, Charlier was in many respects something of a kind uncle to us. He did not make a fuss about anything. He really stuck out his neck for me by involving me, a virtually unknown young artist, in a success series. I know he could be tough as nails with publishers. We were fortunate though, that he negotiated on our behalf as well, and we profited very much from the deals he struck&quot;. Wilson was signed for five albums. Corteggiani himself was yet to leave his mark on the &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; series later on. Wilson became the second, and last Charlier artist, after Giraud, whom the author provided with script pages in a timely fashion, once even receiving a page overnighted from Kuwait where the author then was on documentary assignment, just to keep his artist working.

After a short apprenticeship (during which he produced &quot;Blueberry&quot; study art) to fine tune his art style, already close to that of Giraud, in order to have it move even closer to that of Giraud, Wilson embarked with fervor on the project with his first outing &quot;Les démons du Missouri&quot; (&quot;Missouri Demons&quot;), which essentially became the rationale for the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; adventures to become a spin-off series onto their own. Working seven days a week for ten to twelve hours, Wilson produced five to six pages a month, using a combination of pen and brush for the inks, just as his idol had done for his &quot;Jeunesse&quot; stories and which had become the inspiration for Wilson to abandon the Rotring technical utensils he had originally used in New-Zealand.

As it had in 1980 when Giraud was working on &quot;La longue marche&quot; with an assistant (see &quot;below&quot;), rumors quickly abounded in the tight-knit &quot;bande dessinée&quot; community that Giraud intended to abandon &quot;Blueberry&quot;. This time around however, and unlike 1980, the rumors found their way to the outside world, causing anxiety in the fan community. Despite the publisher&#x27;s standing policy of releasing comics directly in album format, it was decided to have &quot;Les démons du Missouri&quot; pre-published in the newspaper &quot;France-Soir&quot;, one of the largest newspapers in France at the time, in an effort to counteract the growing disquiet. A first for &quot;Blueberry&quot; insofar daily newspapers were concerned, black &amp; white publication began at the start of 1985, with Wilson feeding the newspaper with half-pages as he went along. The first half-page was accompanied by an editorial from Charlier, in which he tried to allay the fears of the fans (see &quot;quotebox&quot;). The format was for good measure repeated in 1987 with Wilson&#x27;s second outing, &quot;Terreur sur le Kansas&quot; (&quot;Terror over Kansas&quot;), for the same newspaper, but abandoned afterwards when Wilson had become an established &quot;Blueberry&quot; artist himself. &quot;France-Soir&quot; saw two half-pages (1b and 2a) from &quot;Terreur sur le Kansas&quot; published that were not incorporated in the album, released later that year, for print technical reasons (see also &quot;The Blueberry biography&quot; in this regard).

Despite the initial trepidations of fans, Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Blueberry&quot;s were favorably received, achieving print run numbers approximating those of the main series, as well as seeing translations in nearly as many languages, with English being the glaring one of the few exceptions as of 2017. Wilson has divulged that Novedi released the first album in a first French printing of 150.000 copies (Novedi had by then taken over the publication for France as well) and a Dutch first printing of 50.000 copies, a huge step up from the initial French only 12.000 copy release for the &quot;Raël&quot; album. The French edition sold out in a matter of weeks, and an additional 20.000 copies followed suit in a hurry. Compared to the main series, the first printing was conservative for the French edition and ample for the Dutch edition. It even had a positive side-effect on his science fiction series &quot;Dans l&#x27;Ombre du Soleil&quot;, which saw a Dutch and German series translation after he had embarked on &quot;Blueberry&quot;, with a Danish and English translation of &quot;Raël&quot; only to boot. Wilson though, had to abandon this series in 1989, having added two more titles, because &quot;Blueberry&quot; demanded all his attention and energy, aside from the fact that it was the more successful one by far, allowing the couple to move to the Provence. It were not only the fans who were relieved, Wilson too had his trepidations alleviated when he met the fans face-to-face for the first time at several comic convention book signings after the release of the first album, grateful for their gracious reception and acceptance of his &quot;Blueberry&quot;, even though most of them concurrently &quot;and&quot; emphatically expressed their relieve that Giraud would continue to be the artist for the main series.

While Wilson was working on &quot;Terreur sur le Kansas&quot;, he was asked by Giraud, who had shortly returned to Europe, to finish up on &quot;Le bout de la piste&quot; as well, as he was pressed for time, preparing to leave for California where he just had set up shop. Wilson did part of the inking of &quot;Le bout de la piste&quot;, while his girlfriend Janet Gale, who had followed him from New Zealand, took on the coloring. Giraud himself assigned her the task, being impressed by the work she had done on her fiancé&#x27;s album. Gale was actually a relative novice, as she only started coloring on her fiancé&#x27;s &quot;Dans l&#x27;Ombre du Soleil&quot; series, having been unable to find legitimate employment in Europe due to her visa status. She would continue to color all her future husband&#x27;s &quot;Blueberry&quot; books, as well as several albums from other artists released by Novedi. Giraud himself was from the moment Wilson took over the series no longer involved creatively, aside from occasionally giving his young colleague some advice, but did receive a &quot;small inventor&#x27;s fee&quot; per title, as he himself had coined it.

While several European countries (including outliers like Iceland and Turkey) had, no post-original creators title – discounting the newspaper serialization of the first two Wilson titles – has seen serialized comic magazine pre-publication in France/French-Belgium itself, where the titles were instead directly released as books. By the time the 1990 &quot;Le raid infernal&quot; was released, virtually every other country had followed suit due to the demise of the serialized magazine format.

Like parent publisher Dargaud, publisher Novedi considered the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; books part of the main series at first until 1990, before they were instituted as a separate spin-off series, mostly for the practical reason of wanting to avoid further pollution of release numbering and chronology. Dargaud&#x27;s stance was adhered to in other European countries, among others in Spain where then regular &quot;Blueberry&quot; publisher Grijalbo/Ediciones Junior released their 1988-1996 &quot;Las aventuras del teniente Blueberry&quot; eight-volume integral collection, encompassing all hitherto released &quot;Blueberry&quot; albums, including those of Wilson. Like Dargaud had to do for their previous &quot;Les géants du l&#x27;ouest&quot; collection, the Spanish had to separately negotiate licenses from Koralle and Novedi for their &quot;Blueberry&quot; releases, but unlike the Dargaud release, these publishers were dutifully mentioned as copyright holders in the colophons of the respective volumes. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Terreur sur le Kansas&quot; became the first album to be released as a separate &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; series title in 1987, as indicated on its back cover. It was therefore not Dargaud who took the initiative for the move, but rather Novedi, due to the fact that Dargaud had lost the publishing rights for new &quot;Blueberry&quot; titles, actually missing out on the first five, most successful, titles of the new series as explained. But Dargaud did adopt the format, once these rights had returned to them in late 1993.

Catalan Communications &quot;had&quot; planned to publish &quot;Missouri Demons&quot;, &quot;Terror over Kansas&quot;, and beyond in English as well, as additions to their &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; series in the &quot;ComCat&quot; line from 1991 onward (alongside Hermann&#x27;s &quot;Comanche&quot; Western incidentally, another favorite of Wilson), which was already indicated on the back covers of the three original ones published in 1989–1990. The former had in effect already received an ISBN. Publication came to naught, due to the near-concurrent, but otherwise coincidental, demises of both Novedi &quot;and&quot; Catalan Communications in early-1990 and mid-1991 respectively.

====Change of writer====
While Charlier&#x27;s death in July 1989 did not cause succession problems for the main series as explained, it did not held true for the &quot;Jeunesse&quot; series as both Charlier&#x27;s heir, Philippe Charlier, and the publisher considered Wilson too much of an inexperienced novice to take on the writing of a major series himself, or as he himself had later put it: &quot;I doubt if &quot;Raël&quot; or &quot;Mantell&quot; accounted for anything at Dargaud [&quot;sic&quot;, Wilson meant Novedi] in this regard&quot;. However, the search for a replacement for Charlier, turned out to be a rather tall order, as none of the established names in the Franco-Belgian comic world were found willing to fill the shoes of the legendary Charlier, whereas non-established names were rejected for pretty much the same reasons why Wilson was not considered as replacement. It was then, in order to break the gridlock, that Wilson suggested François Corteggiani as replacement, deeming it &quot;logical&quot;, as he assumed Corteggiani to be an admirer of Charlier. Corteggiani had been one of the lesser names in the Franco-Belgian comic world, having predominantly written a couple of short-lived humorous comic series and one realistic series, the heavily &quot;Godfather Trilogy&quot; inspired mafia saga &quot;De silence et de sang&quot; – which he had abandoned in 1986 after only two volumes, only to take it on again ten years later, piggybacking on his newfound notoriety as &quot;Blueberry&quot; writer. Both critical and commercial success have always eluded Corteggiani, and by the time he was approached by Novedi and Philippe Charlier, he had suspended his own career as a &quot;bande dessinée&quot; artist, instead becoming a tenured script writer for the French Disney studios. To his credit, Corteggiani refused at first, for the same reason his more established colleagues had already done previously, but eventually conceded on the insistence of Wilson. Wilson had personal reasons to do so, as Corteggiani was a personal friend of the Wilson-couple, aside for the practical reason that he was living in the vicinity of the Wilson-couple at the time. When the non-French speaking Wilson couple first arrived in Europe, they met Corteggiani at the annual Italian Lucca Comics &amp; Games festival. Corteggiani took a shining on the newcomers and took them under his wing. It was Corteggiani, using his vast Franco-Belgian comic world social network, who introduced Wilson to publisher Glénat, resulting in his first European comic series &quot;Dans l&#x27;Ombre du Soleil&quot;, in the process negotiating on behalf of his friend. As already related, it was Corteggiani who, while keeping tabs on the work of his friend, introduced Wilson&#x27;s work to the &quot;Blueberry&quot; creators. Wilson reasoned that by suggesting Cortegianni for a major series, he could return the favor he had provided him a few years earlier, by getting his friend&#x27;s &quot;bande dessinée&quot; career back on track. Actually, he and Wilson had already started their own &quot;Thunderhawks&quot; comic series before Charlier died, an aviation comic set shortly after the first world war in the American South-West, but which had to take a backseat due to the fact that the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series took precedence.

Corteggiani&#x27;s first order of business was to finish up on the script for &quot;Le raid infernal&quot; which was halfway completed by Charlier at the time of his death. This he did to the satisfaction of all parties involved, including Wilson, and Corteggiani was retained as the &quot;Jeunesse&quot; writer ever since.

The publication of Wilson&#x27;s fourth album &quot;La poursuite impitoyable&quot; in 1992 was surprisingly still under the Novedi imprint, over a year after the publishing house had ceased to exist. This can only be explained by the fact that Wilson was originally signed for five albums by Novedi, and that the official receivers of the defunct publisher wanted the revenues for the legal and financial finalization of the bankruptcy. The album therefore became a posthumous Novedi release. All legal issues were apparently resolved by the time of the publication of the fifth Wilson album, &quot;Trois hommes pour Atlanta&quot; one year later, as it was released by Novedi&#x27;s successor Alpen Publishers, becoming the only &quot;Jeunesse&quot; title they were able to release, before they themselves lost publication rights to Dargaud in late 1993.

====&quot;Emmet Walsh&quot; and the departure of Colin Wilson====

Wilson came to regret his loyalty to his friend Corteggiani; while pleased with the scenarios for &quot;Le raid infernal&quot; and &quot;La poursuite impitoyable&quot;, he became considerably less pleased with those following these two outings. The artist complained in a 2000 interview (quote box to the right) that Corteggiani&#x27;s scenarios became increasingly juvenile and decreasingly serious. Wilson reacted by the rapidly declining quality of the scenarios by letting the quality of his artwork, which had been of such a high Giraud-like quality, slide for the two last albums he was yet to pencil by largely reverting to the less detailed loose art style he usually had been (and would be) employing for the American-Anglo comic industry. Even Giraud started to harbor doubts in the same series of interviews albeit in a far more veiled fashion, when he stated that he was &quot; (...)not here to discuss Corteggiani&#x27;s work&quot; when asked about him, though he was a little more outspoken five years later as evidenced in the quote box below.

After the 1994 album &quot;Le prix du sang&quot;, Wilson had had enough and decided to create a more mature &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; story by himself. Taking his cue from Charlier&#x27;s Blueberry biography where a single mention was made of Blueberry&#x27;s post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), he was suffering from when he returned home after the war, Wilson decided to tell a mature, psychological story of how Blueberry contracted the condition during the war. Coined &quot;Emmet Walsh&quot;, the story revolves around the so-named naive southern youth who dreams of heroism and glory and leaves his mother&#x27;s homestead to join the Confederate forces. It was only five to six pages into the story that young Walsh meets up with Blueberry who takes him under his wing. During their time together both men are confronted with the true horrors of war and young Walsh meets a gruesome end ultimately, leaving a distraught Blueberry well on his way to his PTSD. Wilson, knowing full well that he still lacked the experience to write a scenario for a prime series like &quot;Young Blueberry&quot;, sought out the advice of both the senior editors at Dargaud and his former mentor Giraud who by then &quot;had&quot; acquired the experience to write for a prime BD series. Wilson had a tough time convincing the Dargaud editors that knew what he was doing and what he was trying to achieve with his story. Dargaud though requested that Wilson adapted his story so that Blueberry already made an appearance from page one onward. Not wanting to spoil his chances to see his story published, Wilson gave in to their demands and even penciled the first four pages showing the by Dargaud requested adaptations. He refused to budge to Giraud&#x27;s suggestions though, as they were so many and so drastic that the entire Emmet Walsh storyline vanished almost entirely into the background. Giraud however, had not the intention to belittle his younger colleague, but rather wanted to safeguard him from the confrontation he knew Wilson was headed straight into with both Dargaud and Philippe Charlier in particular. Dargaud had just reacquired the &quot;Blueberry&quot; copyrights after the very costly defection of the Giraud/Charlier creator team back in 1979, and Giraud was acutely aware – unlike Wilson as the defection had taken place long before his &quot;Blueberry&quot; engagement – how sensitive the matter of rebellious BD artists was to the publisher. Even more pertinent was the fact that Giraud knew that Philippe Charlier would never go along with the more mature, psychological story Wilson had written, as he as the guardian of his late father&#x27;s artistic legacy, was of the firm conviction that any addition to his father&#x27;s body of work should be fast-paced, light, commercially attractive, shallow adventure stories intended for a (male) adolescent readership only, completely unencumbered by mature themes (especially when it concerned something heavy-handed like PTSD), just as Charlier, Jr. believed his father had always intended.

The inevitable took place shortly thereafter when Corteggiani and Charlier Jr. were informed of Wilson&#x27;s script by Dargaud. As Giraud had already suspected, Charlier Jr. was vehemently opposed and the reaction of Corteggiani was no less vicious. Considering the script a backstabbing betrayal from someone he had considered a friend, Corteggiani&#x27;s friendship with the Wilson couple was terminated right there and then. Wilson on his part immediately terminated his participation on the second outing of the duo&#x27;s &quot;Thunderhawks&quot; aviation series, work on which had just started up by Wilson. Now Wilson found himself faced with the dark side of the tight-knit Franco-Belgian &quot;bande dessinée&quot; community, the backstabbing backroom politics, discovering to his detriment that Charlier Jr. was very much unlike his father and most definitely not his friend – something that his former mentor Giraud had already discovered for himself in his very own specific case. Both Corteggiani and Charlier Jr. immediately set to work in order to have Wilson – who still was a non-French speaker and therefore completely defenseless against the backroom machinations – entirely removed from the Franco-Belgian &quot;bande dessinée&quot; scene. Corteggiani in particular set to work with a vengeance as he not only used his Franco-Belgian BD social network (he had previously used to get Wilson his start in the industry) to make absolutely sure that Wilson would never again work in the Franco-Belgian BD industry, but also by already starting his search for a replacement while Wilson was still employed by Dargaud. The latter was only too happy to give in, and in 1996 Wilson was aggressively manipulated into departing on his own accord. As fully intended by Corteggiani, neither Wilson nor his fiancée (who freelanced as colorist for other Dargaud artists as well besides her fiancé, but who was also targeted by Corteggiani&#x27;s wrath) were able to find work anywhere else in the industry afterwards, and were forced to leave the EU after Wilson&#x27;s work permit had expired the following year. The Wilson couple did not return home to New Zealand however, but to Australia as that country did have a comics scene, contrary to their native country, albeit a small one, and it was from there that they were able to slowly rebuild his comics career.

Wilson himself was in the years directly thereafter reluctant to delve too much into the details surrounding his departure, only speaking about it in more generic terms, such as, &quot;(...)it is an immensely popular series, and as one of its creators is no longer among us, it has now become the purview of many other people who have a say in it. So it has become inevitable that series changes. I&#x27;ve played my part...and now it is in the hands of others. I think the readership should make up its mind for themselves&quot;, and &quot;I think that nowadays the whole problem with the &quot;Blueberry&quot; realm is lying in the circumstance that several key persons are making rather dumb decisions. I at least do not wish to be part of it anymore...&quot; On one rare occasion in 2006 though, he did allow his true feelings and frustrations to show through when he stated, &quot;Philippe Charlier was dead-set on making his mark on all series, editors came and went, it became too complicated. I started to pencil comics, because I was a fan, and only wanted to continue doing that, to tell stories without any kind of business hassles.&quot; Former mentor Giraud actually came to substantiate Wilson&#x27;s latter statement in 2015.

Dargaud has never issued any kind of official proclamation on Wilson&#x27;s departure, and when the next &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; installment was released in 1998 that was not penciled by Wilson, it came as an utter and complete surprise to the &quot;Blueberry&quot; fanbase and the rest of the outside world. What statements about Wilson&#x27;s departure there were made thereafter, Dargaud had left entirely to the artists involved who were inclined to do so. Giraud had seemed to err on the side of caution by apparently siding with the new creator team, when he stated in 2005, &quot;When Charlier died, we couldn&#x27;t continue. He [Wilson] lacked the sharpness and speed to continue alone. He was gradually taken out of the loop by the publisher and the rights holders. I tried to help him, but in vain.&quot; The remarkable thing about Giraud&#x27;s short statement is that it is riddled with half-truths: the later lack of sharpness and his attempts to help him are confirmed, the supposed soft-handed handling of Wilson&#x27;s departure as well as his supposed lack of production speed are outright lies, besides the false impression he invoked by implying that he and Wilson formed a creative team on the series – as already stated, Giraud had no creative input whatsoever after the original stories he and Charlier had created in the 1960s. A comparison of the publication dates of Wilson&#x27;s body of work above and those of his replacement below, learns that Wilson produced right on schedule, neither slower nor faster. Stronger still, it was his replacement who started to lag considerably from 2010 onward, not to mention Giraud with both his &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; series as well as his &quot;Mister Blueberry&quot; cycle, a circumstance that had not been lost on Wilson himself. The duplicitous Corteggiani himself spin-doctored Wilson&#x27;s departure as the artist suffering from a severe bout of homesickness and was dying to return home, a lie he already told Wilson&#x27;s successor in 1996, and one he would repeat at the very few comics conventions he attended directly after the release of the first non-Wilson &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; album.

In May 2020, Wilson divulged for the very first time, that he too had a signed &quot;longest-living clause&quot; contract with Jean-Michel Charlier. Wilson recounted with a certain sardonic measure of glee, how the discovery of his late father&#x27;s copy of the contract among his papers left Philippe Charlier frothing at the mouth from anger. It went a long way explaining why Charlier Jr. was so fanatically determined to get rid of Wilson (a voluntary departure of Wilson would leave Charlier Jr. legally free to do whatever he pleased with the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; series, such as attracting any new artist entirely subject to his bidding and with only the absolute bare minimum of legal entitlement – as eventually realized), but the latter also reiterated that he did not possess the stomach to engage in a long, drawn-out and undoubtedly bitter legal conflict, which explained his willingness to leave on his own accord, as already stated in earlier, above referenced interviews. Incidentally, Giraud and Wilson were the &quot;only&quot; two artists known with whom Jean-Michel Charlier had ever entered into such a legally binding arrangement, again underlining the special place the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series held in Charlier&#x27;s body of work.

====Second change of artist====

The artist Corteggiani approached in 1996 turned out to be , the artist of one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; Franco-Belgian western BDs in the 1970s, the critically acclaimed &quot;Jonathan Cartland&quot; series. It was almost certain that Blanc-Dumont had been the only artist Corteggiani sought out as the latter was well aware of the fact that he was a favorite of both Giraud as well as of the late Charlier Sr., who had once stated, &quot;Had I not coincidentally met Jean Giraud, I would have preferably started the long &quot;Blueberry&quot; saga with Michel Blanc-Dumont.&quot; To his credit, Blanc-Dumont had no idea what was going on with the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; series and could only rely on what Corteggiani cared to tell him, which was in a non-committal way informing him that there were &quot;some differences of opinion&quot; with Wilson and if Blanc-Dumont was interested to do &quot;Blueberry&quot; or &quot;something else&quot; with him. As Blanc-Dumont recalled, &quot;He therefore made me a [generic] proposal, like all good scenario writers do.&quot; On that occasion Blanc-Dumont had to decline though, as he had to finish up on his aviation BD &quot;Colby&quot; he had created with Greg and the replacement BD for &quot;Cartland&quot; (in which he had been very much invested), he, to his immense regret, had to stop due to the illness and ultimate death in 2005 of his scenario writer Laurence Harlé, with whom he had a very close and warm working relationship.

A few months later, in January 1997, Blanc-Dumont was again approached by both Philippe Charlier and Jean Giraud during breakfast in a hotel during the Angoulême International Comics Festival, and this time he was asked straight up front if he wanted to take over the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; series. Wilson had by then already left, so there was no danger of any potential guilt feelings on the part of Blanc-Dumont. &quot;This series had already been taken over by Colin Wilson, who had delivered very good series outings, the scenarios having been taken over by François Corteggiani. I think it was François who first told me that Wilson wanted to quit to return to his country, New Zealand. And in Angoulême, Philippe Charlier and especially Jean Giraud went further by really asking me to resume the series. Giraud was so happy that I accepted that, when we took the train together to return to Paris, he had to tell me three stories of Blueberry during the trip, he was so overflowing with ideas. This was a great moment for me as well. And I took over &quot;La Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; without stress, because I had nothing left to prove,&quot; Blanc-Dumont recalled. As it turned out, this was one of the very rare occasions, arguably the only one, that Giraud and Charlier Jr. were of the same mind. As indicated in the quote box above, Giraud was a great admirer of Blanc-Dumont&#x27;s &quot;Cartland&quot; art, and had actually already asked him a few years earlier to provide the art for the &quot;Blueberry 20 ans après&quot; (&quot;Blueberry, 20 years later&quot;, the later coined &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; sequel) project he had in mind, a project Blanc-Dumont declined as he was finishing up on the last &quot;Cartland&quot; outing, &quot;and&quot; because he deemed Giraud&#x27;s synopsis too &quot;Mœbiusienne&quot; for his tastes. Blanc-Dumont had one condition however, &quot;I wished to create a Blanc-Dumont BD, come what may; a &quot;Blueberry&quot; that is clearly mine, despite the characteristics he had been given by those who had drawn him before, especially those he received from Jean and Charlier. It really had to become my &quot;Young Blueberry&quot;.&quot; Giraud&#x27;s glee over the appointment of Blanc-Dumont as the new &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; artist, also served as a rationale for his lackluster support of his erstwhile protégé Colin Wilson.

After the (by Philippe Charlier desired variant) contracts were signed on 8 April 1997, Blanc-Dumont committed himself to deliver four pages a month, stating, &quot;If you have reached page 23, it becomes easier. After that you work in a far more relaxed manner.&quot; The first Blanc-Dumont &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; album, &quot;La solution Pinkerton&quot; was released in November 1998, four years after the publication of the last Wilson album, without any serialized magazine pre-publication. Blanc-Dumont&#x27;s wife, , who had since their betrothal been the colorist on all her husband&#x27;s work (including &quot;Cartland&quot; and &quot;Colby&quot;), was retained as such for his new commission. Claudine incidentally, had already been given the assignment by Dargaud to replace Claude Poppé&#x27;s original coloring of the first four &quot;Blueberry&quot; albums for their 1993/94 reprint run and beyond – though the original coloring was restored for the 2012 commemorative omnibus collection.

As touched upon above, the fanbase and outside world were entirely unaware that an artist change had even been in the making, due to Dargaud&#x27;s complete information black-out, and therefore completely taken aback after the four-year series suspension by the unexpected publication of the first Blanc-Dumont album. While the first Blanc-Dumont outing did reasonably well, because it was a &quot;Blueberry&quot; installment after all, fans were not quite sure of what to make of it for two reason; firstly the scenario quality that kept declining, and secondly, Blanc-Dumont&#x27;s artwork itself. Fans could not get used (nor would they ever be, as it turned out) to the somewhat static, almost wooden art style, which worked perfectly for his baroque, psychological and subdued &quot;Cartland&quot; BD, but considerably less so for a dynamic, action driven BD like &quot;Blueberry&quot; – nor had it ever done so for his own &quot;Colby&quot; action BD for that matter, and which was therefore canceled by Dargaud after only three series outings as a commercial failure, though it did leave an entirely unencumbered Blanc-Dumont completely free to accept the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; commission. Foreboding signs on the wall though, became already apparent a couple of years later, painfully so, when Dargaud found itself confronted with ever declining printing numbers for subsequent volumes, as specified hereafter, and the fact that from the very start far fewer foreign publishers were found willing to pick up the Blanc-Dumont version of the series for their territories.

Despite his lack of public support for his erstwhile protégé Wilson, Giraud actually turned out to be in agreement with the latter&#x27;s critical assessment of Corteggiani&#x27;s scenarios. Sensing the disquiet among &quot;Blueberry&quot; fans, but &quot;also&quot; driven by his desire to get his idol Blanc-Dumont as good a start as humanly possible, Giraud had already in 1997 expressed his interest to take on a more active role in the scenario writing by stating that young Blueberry &quot;would continue to traverse through the war on his merry way, but by taking the realities and the sufferings that war entailed a little bit more seriously.&quot; Additionally, he came up with an idea to mitigate the negative effects Cortegianni&#x27;s increasingly juvenile scenarios had on the &quot;Blueberry&quot;-brand by having Blueberry integrated in a more mature manner into the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; series (created in 1979 by the original &quot;Blueberry&quot; creators and started up again by Giraud in 1991). &quot;After the Civil War,&quot; Giraud clarified in 1997, &quot;we find Blueberry back in a deplorable state; he&#x27;s wounded, has lost his memory, and it is Cutlass who will help him to regain it. But that&#x27;s not a blessing at all, because the reason he has amnesia is that he was responsible for a mistake that cost the lives of many people. The story is so crazy that the reporter it is related to, foregoes on publishing it out of fear that no one will believe him.&quot; Philippe Charlier however, immediately exercised his veto right to torpedo both Giraud suggestions, rather unsurprisingly actually, as they were in effect indirect, veiled endorsements of the ideas Wilson had put forward in his rejected &quot;Emmet Walsh&quot; scenario. Charlier Jr.&#x27;s obstinacy irked Giraud to no end, and he stated in a later interview, &quot;If I were doing it, I&#x27;d give it more energy, give it some structure: develop an arc, and end it. And have a very dramatic climax that shows why, after the Civil War, Blueberry heads out west again, broken down, limping, why he&#x27;s so unhappy...Someday, I&#x27;ll have to reveal that secret!&quot; Giraud actually acted upon this impulse to an extent, by incorporating flashback scenes in the &quot;OK Corral&quot; cycle (later collected in the 2007 stand-alone album &quot;Apaches&quot;), where a bed-ridden Blueberry tells a reporter the story of how he arrived at his first Far West posting directly after the war, completely ravaged by PTSD.

Shortly before his death in March 2012, after having pussyfooted around the subject matter for years, the gloves came finally off when Giraud came with both barrels after the two men he held personally responsible for the devaluation of the &quot;Blueberry&quot;-brand in the below referenced 2015 Sadoul biography. He blasted Phillipe Charlier in particular for dumbing down the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; series by his incessant insistence on commercial infantile shallowness, thereby becoming the prime responsible agent for turning &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; into a &quot;ridiculous&quot; series, conceding that he &quot;was shocked, even, by how lightly he [Corteggiani] took certain scenes&quot;, which he considered an affront to the American Civil War itself and its victims, having in his eyes been reduced to a disrespectful joke and banality. The second sin, equally heinous as far as he was concerned, Giraud had squarely laid at the feet of both Charlier Jr. and Corteggiani was the fact that he was deeply pained to see a &quot;bande dessinée&quot; artist of Blanc-Dumont&#x27;s stature being &quot;forced to pick up a spinoff&quot;, after coming from his own major series [&quot;Cartland&quot;] and being reduced to take on &quot;a sequel to something that wasn&#x27;t even his own!&quot;, which was in effect very similar to the fate that had befallen Giraud&#x27;s old mentor Jijé in the end at the hand of Charlier Sr.

Giraud&#x27;s &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; author rights incidentally, extended beyond merely collecting the aforementioned &quot;small inventor&#x27;s fee&quot;, as it turned out that he too was entitled to exercise veto rights. Giraud however, had never chosen to exercise these rights, despite his displeasure over the quality of the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; series. His reasons for this was that he did not wanted to be the one, responsible for &quot;artists and scenario writers&quot; becoming unable &quot;to feed themselves&quot; – meaning Blanc-Dumont in particular unsurprisingly, but surprisingly the in Giraud&#x27;s view deeply flawed Corteggiani as well – , adding sardonically that Philippe Charlier had no such qualms whatsoever and that the latter &quot;disgusted&quot; him by his ruthless haste to &quot;coolly&quot; rake in the royalties as quickly as he was able to without exhibiting any other consideration beyond that.

As already observed by Wilson, the quality of Corteggiani&#x27;s scenarios kept falling steadily over the years to the point that Swiss BD reporter Erik Svane felt already in 2003 compelled during an interview with the disgraced artist to let slip that &quot;Corteggiani&#x27;s scenarios can not hold a candle to those of Charlier&quot;, in essence giving voice to what the vast majority of the Blueberry fanbase was already starting to feel by then. A salient detail was, that François Corteggiani had all but disappeared from the public eye by that time; had he still made some rare BD festival appearances at the debut of &quot;La solution Pinkerton&quot; in 1998–1999, no public appearances and less than half a dozen of very short publicized non-Blueberry related interviews were known since then. By February 2015, criticism of his &quot;Blueberry&quot; writings had apparently reached to the point at which Corteggiani even felt compelled to take his personal web-blog offline. Tellingly, Corteggiani had never discussed &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; even once on his mere five-year old blog. His complete absence from the 2003 German &quot;Zack-Dossier 1: Blueberry und der europäische Western-Comic&quot; reference book (where the long dead Jean-Michel Charlier was extensively covered by archival interviews), was equally telling and conspicuous in this respect.

====Translations====
No formal post-original creators editions have seen the day of light in the English language as of 20165, but, like the source series, the &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; spin-off series did see translations in numerous languages, the three titles by the original creators and the Wilson outings specifically, but appreciatively less so for the subsequent releases. The latter is amply exemplified by the Corteggiani/Blanc-Dumont versions, which are not that favorably received – unlike the Wilson versions, whose first three outings were notably well received, in no small part due to the fact that they were still being written by co-creator Charlier – as indicated by its steadily diminishing popularity; had volume 12 still seen a French-language first-print run of 100.000 copies in 2001, by 2015 that number had dwindled to 40.000 (which is approaching the cut-off point for a standard Francophone BD album being economically viable to become published) when volume 21 was released, aside from the fact that several publishers had foregone the publication of these book titles in their countries altogether.

As of 2019, the spin-off series by Corteggiani and Blanc-Dumont remains only published in French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Danish and Italian, a far cry from the nearly two dozen languages the main series had once been published in, or the by Colin Wilson penciled &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; volumes for that matter. Additionally, most non-French editions only enjoyed a print-run of no more than 5.000 copies. Worse still, in Croatia and Finland the Blanc-Dumont series only saw a partial one-time-only release before becoming canceled altogether, while Denmark and the Netherlands did not see any reprint-runs after their initial, small first printings, which is again a far cry from the main, and Wilson series. Ironically, that has made some sold out volumes expensive collectibles in these countries. The Germans and Norwegians (the latter likewise only seeing three individual Blanc-Dumont volumes released, though they added three more volumes into their Egmont omnibus collection version, before quitting the collection in 2010) were fortunate in this regard as those countries saw reprints as part of their 2006 aforementioned Egmont omnibus collections (the Danes had not even bothered to include the Blanc-Dumont series into their version of the Egmont omnibus collection, though they had been very keen to have the Wilson series version included); whereas the Spaniards enjoyed a reprint run in their 2017/19 &quot;Edición Coleccionista&quot; by Altaya, and the Italians two, in their 2014/16 &quot;Collana Western&quot; and 2022/23 &quot;Collana Blueberry&quot; releases, both published by RCS MediaGroup. The only countries known to have seen magazine (pre-)publications of Blanc-Dumont episodes were Italy, in the weekly magazine &quot;Skorpio&quot; during 2014, and Serbia, which saw a partial series publication between 2015 and 2018 in their monthly &quot;&quot; comic magazine. Local publishers in Serbia waived the release into a bonafide album format though.

====Coda====
In the same year Giraud died, Blanc-Dumont&#x27;s wife and life-long colorist Claudine also died. Being also confronted with the fast dwindling popularity, continued criticism of his &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; version, and the potential growing realization that contracts signed with Philippe Charlier were not that advantageous for him, Blanc-Dumont appeared to have lost all motivation and interest in further creating &quot;bande dessinées&quot;. For the longest of times it looked like the conclusion of the intended two-volume &quot;Le convoi des bannis&quot; story would never see the day of light, made even more unlikely by the death of Corteggiani on 21 September 2022. Still, Blanc-Dumont had been working on the conclusion, albeit at a very slow pace. He posted a first update on his &quot;L&#x27;univers de Michel Blanc-Dumont&quot; Facebook page on 25 July 2016, which he followed up with eight short Facebook postings of partial page preview teasers over the 2016-18 time period to demonstrate that the concluding &quot;L&#x27;antre du serpent&quot; (&quot;The lair of the serpent&quot;) volume had remained in the works all this time. The last of the page preview teasers (p. 37, usually with only nine more pages to go) was posted on 22 November 1918, with Blanc-Dumonts optimistically expecting the albums release to occur in the spring of 2019. This did not come to pass however, and six years later Blanc-Dumont came forward in June 2024 with the revised announcement that he now expected the album to be released in &quot;early 2025&quot;. However, he concurrently announced that volume 22 would also be his very last &quot;Young Blueberry&quot;, which almost certainly will also mean the definitive end of the &quot;(Young) Blueberry&quot; series as Giraud heir Isabelle inherited the right – shared equally with Philippe Charlier – to block the appointment of any and all new, third artist, a right which she, contrary to her late husband, has continued to exercise to this day, the below mentioned one-shot excepted.

In a sense, it was the maligned Colin Wilson who came out on top in the end. Not only have his &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; albums retained their popularity among fans, particularly the ones written by Charlier (a first-time Polish release of all his &quot;Blueberry&quot; work in one omnibus collection was published as recent as 2022), he has also managed to rebuild his comics career. Firstly in the US and subsequently in the UK and Italy (where he penciled a successful outing in the Italian &quot;Tex Willer&quot; series, another legendary European western comic), before coming full circle with a triumphant return on the Franco-Belgian &quot;bande dessineé&quot; scene which was topped of by a successful latter-day neo-western mini-series set in the 1920s, thereby completely thwarting the original intent of his erstwhile friend Corteggiani, who himself was rapidly fading into oblivion after 2015. That 2019–2021 series, &quot;Nevada&quot;, saw a partial return to the detailed meticulous art style Wilson had employed for his &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; work. Furthermore, when Wilson started to tour the comic-con and BD festival circuit again in the late-2000s, he quickly found out that the art he created for fans at album/comic book signing sessions (called &quot;dédicases&quot; in French) was in high demand and that of &quot;Blueberry&quot; in particular, especially when created in his best possible meticulously detailed Giraud-like dynamic art style which had made his &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; so popular with fans to begin with. Wilson continued to do so ever since right up until the present day, and has during signing sessions confided to sympathetic BD album store owners that the &quot;Blueberry&quot; art he creates on commission basis alone is currently already enough to earn him a decent living. As with the not-for-regular-publication &quot;Blueberry&quot; art his former mentor Giraud had created on personal title and for his own Moebius Production company, the quite prolific &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; art Wilson has made since then in like fashion, remains well outside the legal purview of Dargaud – which is clearly regulated in EU copyright law, where, contrary to the US, it is stipulated that the rights of artists are prevalent over those of publishers. Blanc-Dumont&#x27;s similar art on the other hand, is shunned by &quot;Blueberry&quot; fans as a cursory glance on eBay (France) teaches the observer; owners of such art find that they can not even give away their possessions – though typically, this has not applied to his &quot;Cartland&quot; art, which has remained current to an extent.

===Intermezzo: &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot;===

This spin-off series was the second attempt, this time by Alpen Publishers, to further capitalize on the huge popularity both the main, and Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Blueberry&quot; series enjoyed at the time. Written by co-creator Giraud, the series was set around the events depicted in &quot;The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Mine&quot; and dealt with scrupulous gun runners arming Apaches, thereby instigating an uprising. Giraud, who had just permanently returned from his extended stay in the US, was in effect still mourning the passing of Charlier and could not yet bring himself to embark on the art for &quot;Blueberry&quot; again, but wanted to pay homage to the legacy of his long-time writing partner by creating a story in his spirit, or as Giraud had put it: &quot;[A]nd [I] said to myself: Well, I&#x27;m going to see if I&#x27;m able to write a story à la Charlier. So I wrote this scenario, not too bad, but quite traditional, quite classic&quot;.

Chosen by the publisher for the art work was William Vance, an accomplished Belgian comic artist in his own right and renowned for his &quot;XIII&quot; comic series. Vance, with whom Giraud had virtually no dealings in person before, drew the first two outings in the series which were colored by his life-long colaborist and wife , but declined afterwards to continue, partly because he was required to finish an album in only four months (in Europe, one year was the typical mean to complete a comic book of 48 pages, but not rarely exceeds this time span in recent decades) and that he was unaccustomed to Giraud&#x27;s style as script writer. Additionally, even though the first book sold 100.000 copies (while respectable, relatively modest compared to the contemporary print runs of the two other series, they being printed in numbers at the very least double that,) fans received the book with mixed feelings as Vance&#x27;s style was a too radical departure to their tastes from that of Giraud. This actually was part of the reasons why Wilson&#x27;s work for &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; was so favorably received and partly the reason why Blanc-Dumont&#x27;s was not. While conceding that he found Vance&#x27;s particular style &quot;seductive but sometimes artificial&quot; – having been pleased with the first album, but less so with the second – Giraud himself was disappointed and hurt by the defection of a professional like the established Vance for reasons of aesthetics and integrity, as he wanted the series to be executed by one artist only, deeming the defection &quot;disastrous&quot; for the series.

====Change of artist (II)====
After Vance had thrown in the towel, the unresolved story cycle lingered in limbo for a further seven years, during which Alpen editor Thierry Smolderen went in search for a replacement for Vance, at one point considering up and coming BD artist (who was even asked to produce a couple of test plates), before Giraud in person finally found Michel Rouge – whose style was closer to his – willing to finish the cycle. For Rouge, Giraud modified his writing style by providing him with detailed page-layout sketches complete with dialog, which were quite faithfully adhered to by the artist. That Rouge&#x27;s style resembled that of Giraud, was hardly a surprise, as Rouge was actually not a stranger to &quot;Blueberry&quot;. Twenty years earlier, when Rouge was still a quite unknown and aspiring comic artist, Giraud took him on as an apprentice and had him ink pages 15–35 of &quot;La longue marche&quot; in 1980 – thereby doing for an aspiring artist what Jijé had done for him nearly two decades before that. At the time it gave rise to the rumor that Giraud was planning to abandon his co-creation and that Rouge was groomed to take over the series. Though a rumor, there was a nuanced morsel of truth in it, as Rouge clarified two decades later: &quot;No, he did not want to abandon &quot;Blueberry&quot;, but rather sought support and perhaps the opportunity to create books, like the ones he is currently doing [&quot;Mister Blueberry&quot;]. At the time, he was already playing with the notion of doing parallel series&quot;. Rouge&#x27;s words notwithstanding though, and while he has never acted upon it in earnest, Giraud did later admit that there were &quot;temptations&quot; in that period of time. Though not &quot;Blueberry&quot;, Rouge himself &quot;did&quot; take over that other famed contemporary Franco-Belgian western comic series, Hermann&#x27;s &quot;Comanche&quot;, but Rouge was not able to regain the popularity that series once enjoyed, when it was still penciled by Hermann, and the series was suspended indefinitely after Rouge had only added five titles to the series.

Jean Giraud and 
* 3: &quot;Frontière sanglante&quot; (Dargaud, 2000/06, )

Originally intended to become a full-fledged series, the three &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; titles have remained the only outings in the series, though they too have seen several foreign language publications. Although not in France itself, several European countries have seen serialized magazine pre-publication of the first two titles. The third 2000 title though, was invariably directly released in book format for virtually all countries. No (formal) English language editions were released5. Incidentally, in 2013 Giraud returned the favor Vance had provided for his co-creation, when he took on the art work of volume 18 for his &quot;XIII&quot; series, and which &quot;has&quot; seen English translations.

Despite Giraud&#x27;s original intention to pay homage to his late co-worker, the series did not sit well with Charlier&#x27;s heir, son Philippe. Citing his concerns for readers becoming confused by the addition of a third series taking place at a different point in time, he stated nine months after Giraud&#x27;s death, &quot;Thank God, &quot;Marshal&quot; was nothing more than a triptych. But some readers got a little lost by it.&quot; Considering his deep loathing of the deceased Giraud by then (see &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot;), Philippe Charlier&#x27;s ostensible &quot;concern for the readers&quot; appeared duplicitous at least, as he on the very same occasion advocated the inception of a plethora of spin-off series based on the secondary &quot;Blueberry&quot; characters.

===Sequel: &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot;===

A third spin-off series, coined Blueberry 1900, was conceived by original creator Giraud in as early as 1993, intended as a bonafide sequel series. Set, as the series title already implied, in the era of the William McKinley presidency, it would not only have featured a 57-year old Blueberry, but his adult son as well, albeit in a minor role. The story line, intended to encompass five albums, was to take place around events surrounding the assassination of President McKinley. Pegged for the artwork was French BD artist François Boucq whom Giraud had met at a BD event in honor of his lifelong friend Jean-Claude Mézières, and concurrently discussed the project with. Actually, Giraud had previously approached Michel Blanc-Dumont, whose &quot;lyric&quot; art work for &quot;Jonathan Cartland&quot; he adored, for the project in 1993, then still tentatively called &quot;Blueberry 20 ans après&quot; (&quot;Blueberry, 20 years later&quot;). Blanc-Dumont, despite being reciprocally an admirer of Giraud&#x27;s art and aside from being still invested in his own Western BD, thought the project not suitable for him, deeming the script outline too &quot;Mœbiusienne&quot; for his taste, and had already suggested Boucq instead. Boucq showed interest and was enthusiastic about the project, and indeed embarked on the production of pre-publication art studies, but deemed a cycle of five albums too much, managing to negotiate it down to a cycle of three albums.

However, Philippe Charlier, son of the late Jean-Michel Charlier and proprietor of &quot;JMC Aventures&quot; – the foundation and legal copyright owner, set up back in 1990 with the specific intent to safeguard the creative integrity and legacy of his father, both in a spiritual as well as a commercial sense, but which had become dormant after the failed experiment at Alpen Publishers – was nowhere near as enthusiastic as Boucq was. He became increasingly alarmed and downright aghast when reading commentaries, Giraud made in contemporary magazine interviews, clarifying his intentions and premises for the proposed series of a Blueberry residing with the Hopi tribe, meditating under the influence of mind-expanding substances, while President McKinley was levitating in the White House due to a Hopi spell. As heir and steward of his father&#x27;s co-creations and legacy, being the 50% co-owner of the &quot;Blueberry&quot; brand, he still had the unequivocal right to veto any and all proposals regarding the trademark &quot;Blueberry&quot; and did not hesitate for a moment to exercise his prerogative in this case, going as far as threatening Giraud with a lawsuit, resulting in that the project fell through. As per a horrified Charlier Jr. in a contemporary statement: &quot;The script is unbelievably horrifying. It is an effrontery, constructed out of implausible circumstances. Like in the new [&quot;OK Corral&quot;] story cycle, we find a totally passive Blueberry, only meditating, while the president, enchanted by Indians, is levitating in the White House&quot;. As he indicated, though he had given his seal of approval in this case, Charlier Jr., also became wary and disapproving of Giraud depicting the former lieutenant as a passive loafer in the &quot;OK Corral&quot; story arc, only aggravated from his point of view by the fact that Giraud could not refrain himself from including some elements from Native-American mysticism in &quot;OK Corral&quot; and &quot;Dust&quot; – though not anywhere near as extensive as he had apparently intended for &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot;.

Philippe Charlier, conservative by nature like his father, had, unlike his father, no patience whatsoever with Giraud&#x27;s &quot;New Age&quot; predilections (also serving as an additional rationale for his decision to proceed with Alpen Publishers back in 1990, instead of Les Humanoïdes Associés, renowned for its catalog of more adult, &quot;esoteric&quot; BDs, like those of Boucq and Alejandro Jodorowsky), particularly for his admitted fondness for mind-expanding substances. It was he (after his father&#x27;s death), who testified in a deposition, that his father had always &quot;detested&quot; Giraud&#x27;s work as &quot;Mœbius&quot; and that he considered that work as &quot;treason&quot;, after which Giraud – known for his lifelong aversion to any kind of legal proceedings – backed down. While Philippe was unable to stop the &quot;OK Corral&quot; cycle, because of the &quot;longest living survivor&quot; main series covenant Giraud and Charlier Sr. had signed, he was legally able to stop Giraud in his tracks for &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; because it had never been presented by Giraud as a &quot;main series&quot; effort, but rather as a brand expansion (notice the legal difference), and on this Charlier Jr. had veto rights.14 Reinforced by the for him favorable court ruling, Charlier Jr. was therefore subsequently able to veto Giraud&#x27;s 1999 scenario outline for a &quot;Fort Mescalero&quot; movie, which was to feature Blueberry in extensive substance-induced hallucinatory scenes, besides Giraud&#x27;s intention to have the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; series merge with the &quot;Blueberry&quot; main series, due to the fact that later volumes of that series also increasingly incorporated likewise scenes, arguing that such a merging would indeed constitute another brand extension.

How far Giraud actually already was in his thinking was exemplified by the inclusion of his art featuring Blueberry with Hopi tribesmen, endowed with the caption &quot;In Hopi Towns&quot;, as the interior flyleaf illustration for the regular 1990 &quot;Arizona Love&quot; French album release, reprinted as such, without the caption, in the last 1991 Graphitti Designs release, &quot;Moebius #9&quot;. Additionally, Giraud had sneaked in some &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; elements (including floating Washington dignitaries) in the non-&quot;Blueberry&quot;, Native-American themed, short story &quot;The Words of Chief Seattle&quot;, which saw English publication in Epic&#x27;s second &quot;Blueberry&quot; book release, &quot;Ballad for a Coffin&quot;.

Giraud&#x27;s fascination with shamanism went even further back than that, when he was introduced by Jodorowsky – during the failed &quot;Dune&quot;-project – in 1974 to the writings of Carlos Castaneda, who had written a series of books that describe his training in shamanism, particularly with a group whose lineage descended from the Toltecs. The books, narrated in the first person, related his experiences under the tutelage of a Yaqui &quot;Man of Knowledge&quot; named Don Juan Matus. Castaneda&#x27;s writings made a deep and everlasting impression on Giraud, already open to Native-Mexican folk culture due to his three previous extended trips to the country (he had visited the country a third time in 1972, also see &quot;Giraud on Carlos Castaneda&quot;), and it did influence his art as &quot;Mœbius&quot;, particularly in regard to dream sequences, though he was not quite able to work in such influences in his mainstream &quot;Blueberry&quot; BD. Yet, unbeknownst to writer Charlier, he did already sneak in some Castaneda elements in &quot;Nez Cassé&quot;. Castaneda&#x27;s influence reasserted itself in full in Giraud&#x27;s later life, having worked in elements more openly after Charlier&#x27;s death in &quot;Geronimo l&#x27;Apache&quot;, becoming, as indicated, a major element for &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot;.

====Ramifications====
Boucq was disappointed with the project falling through, disagreeing with Charlier Jr.&#x27;s assessment: &quot;Quite the contrary, depicting him as an old man, forced us to endow him with a special kind of dignity&quot;. Yet, for him it turned out to be a blessing in disguise eventually, as it became an inspiration for Jodorowsky (co-creator of Giraud&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Incal&quot; series, and already a frequent Boucq collaborator), to co-create with him their own acclaimed western BD, &quot;&quot;. Even the fictional &quot;Fort Mescalero&quot; has resurfaced as Blueberry&#x27;s first Far West posting in the 2007 prequel album &quot;Apaches&quot;, aside from the fact that much of what he had envisioned for this project actually turned up in the 2004 &quot;Blueberry&quot; movie. As a warming-up for &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot;, Boucq and Giraud had already collaborated on a Native-American themed project when they both contributed to the 1995 &quot;Laissé Pour Mort&quot;, a to 500 pieces limited CD/Portfolio release from Parisian-based publisher Stardom, Giraud&#x27;s own publishing house/art gallery, ran at the time by his second wife Isabelle. Later, in 2008, Giraud submitted a &quot;Blueberry-meets-Bouncer&quot; contribution to the 250-piece limited &quot;Bouncer&quot; art portfolio from short-lived publisher Osidarta, aside from providing a foreword.

Despite Charlier Jr.&#x27;s vehement resistance, Giraud himself seemed to have never abandoned the notion of doing &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; as was evidenced in a 2008 interview, when he was asked if he would ever return to &quot;Blueberry&quot; after he had once stated in a prior magazine interview that he was done with his creation upon the conclusion of the &quot;OK Corral&quot; story arc. Giraud&#x27;s answer was: &quot;Looking back at it, I realized that I really wanted to continue &quot;Blueberry&quot;. This would probably not be the case if I were to re-start a cycle of 5 albums, because I do not think I have the energy left for another ten years of work. Actually, I want to take up the idea of &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; again, which has a very realistic side, sometimes a more crazy one: the Indians were a magical people, that was part of their culture, and I want to stage the collision between our world, through the conquest of the West, and the world of Indians who resist. It is often shown how events took place in a strategic sense, but I wish to plunge into Indian sociology, like it was done in &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;, by replacing our materialistic vision of the world, and by explaining the clash of cultures that took place. Of course, there is a certain challenge in doing the story this way, because I might possibly yank the rug from under the feet of the reader. I still have to rework the script and do the page divisions, but I think it will take between 100 and 200 pages&quot;. Giraud&#x27;s death in 2012 ended all notions of a &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; installment, and quite possibly any further installment of the main series as well.

In December 2012, nine months after Giraud&#x27;s death, a lengthy interview with Philippe Charlier was published in the French BD journal &quot;&quot;. In it, Charlier Jr., taking considerable care not to speak out of turn for the Giraud heirs, laid out his vision for the future of the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series. He explained that he saw no reason why of all his father&#x27;s creations, Blueberry should be the only one left without a future, and that if the main series was to be continued (which he fully expected) he would only sign off on &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; artist Michel Blanc-Dumont as the main artist – unsurprisingly perhaps, considering the exploitative nature of the contracts signed, which were designed to mostly benefit Charlier Jr. in particular. He justified that choice by claiming that he had been the late Giraud&#x27;s favorite as well – Charlier Jr. was apparently unaware that Giraud had over the years become increasingly disenchanted with the quality of Blanc-Dumont&#x27;s art, which he had previously admired. (see &quot;above&quot;). Furthermore, Charlier Jr, inspired by similar initiatives launched for the equally successful &quot;Thorgal&quot; and &quot;XIII&quot; (William Vance&#x27;s magnum opus) BD series, fully advocated the launch of multiple spin-off productions based on the secondary characters introduced in the two &quot;Blueberry&quot; series (Charlier Jr. did not consider &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; as part of &quot;Blueberry&quot; canon), to be created by artists of &quot;his&quot; own choosing. When checking in over the telephone with both publisher Dargaud and Giraud&#x27;s widow Isabelle on a potential main series continuation, the insensitive &quot;Casemate&quot; editors received an irked &quot;far too soon to be even discussed&quot; reply from Dargaud, and a very terse and curt &quot;A continuation? Why not.&quot; reply from the still grieving Isabelle Giraud.

Philippe Charlier&#x27;s grandiose vision of a large, commercialized and lucrative multi-media &quot;Blueberry&quot;-franchise came, contrary to the successful ones established for &quot;Thorgal&quot; and &quot;XIII&quot;, to naught however, for two reasons. Firstly, as already related above, Blanc-Dumont had effectively all but retired from the &quot;bande dessinée&quot; industry in 2015, which was in part due to the commercial failure of his &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; version in the end. Secondly, and more pertinently, Charlier Jr. discovered that an equally shared veto right is a double-edged sword, as heir Isabelle Giraud turned out every bit as protective, aggressively so even, of her late husband&#x27;s artistic and commercial legacy as Philippe Charlier has ever been of his father&#x27;s. Having had had a ringside view, Isabelle Giraud had witnessed firsthand the frustrations and aggravation Charlier Jr. had caused her husband in the last decade-and-a-half of his life, as related in the below-listed 2015 Numa Sadoul biography, and has until 2019 not approved a single &quot;Blueberry&quot; publication project beyond the 2012 &quot;Intégrale omnibus collection&quot;, let alone a new artist for the continuation of the main, or &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; series – in stark contrast to her late husband&#x27;s work signed as &quot;Mœbius&quot;. Like Jijé&#x27;s widow before her, Isabelle Giraud had no intention whatsoever to let Philippe Charlier profit from her late husband&#x27;s body of work by even a penny above and beyond he was legally owed.

==The Blueberry biography==

In 1974 Charlier had a sixteen-page background article added to &quot;Ballade pour un cercueil&quot; (), when the book was first released. The article concerned a fictitious biography of Mike Steve Donovan, alias Mike S. Blueberry, detailing his life from birth to death, and written from a historic, journalistic point of view. When asked about it a decade later, Charlier clarified that once it became clear to him that Blueberry had become the central character of the series he had conceived, he then already postulated in his mind the broad strokes of the complete life and works of his creation, including the reasons for Blueberry&#x27;s broken nose and odd alias. By the time &quot;Ballade pour un cercueil&quot; was ready for its book release, Charlier deemed the moment had arrived to entrust his musings to paper. There had been a practical reason as well for this. The story already ran 16 pages over-length and as contemporary printers printed eight double-sided comic book pages on one sheet of print paper, the addition of the 16-page biography was not that much of a bother for their production process. &quot;Ballade pour un cercueil&quot; therefore became one of the first Franco-Belgium comic albums to break the mold of the hitherto standard 48-page count format.
Currently somewhat of a staple in European comics, at that time the inclusion of an informative background section in a comic book of that size and wealth of detail was hitherto unheard of and a complete novelty, and what Charlier had not foreseen was that many in the pre-internet era mistook the biography for real, factual history, propagating it as such in other outside media as well. Charlier, who also was an investigative journalist and a documentary maker with a solid reputation for thorough documentation, had previously already written several, shorter historical Old West background editorials for the 1969-1970 &quot;Super Pocket Pilote&quot; series (issues 4–9) as companion pieces for the &quot;Jeunesse de Blueberry&quot; shorts, which &quot;were&quot; historically accurate – and, incidentally, working much of the material contained therein, especially the photographs, into the biography for the post-war era – and readers of the pre-internet-era therefore assumed that the biography was likewise.

Still, having written the biography within the historical context &quot;as postulated in the comic&quot;, fully expecting his readership to understand it as such, Charlier originally had not the intention to perform a prank at the expense of his readers, despite him later presenting it as such in the above statement, mischievously poking fun at the &quot;respectable&quot; and &quot;eminent&quot;, but gullible, scholars (while carefully not including the non-scholar &quot;Blueberry&quot; fanbase) – and which was in concordance with biographer Ratier&#x27;s observation of the author&#x27;s penchant for &quot;taking liberties&quot; with actual events for dramatic effect. His &quot;it was meant to expand a bit upon the knowledge of Blueberry&#x27;s past&quot; statement was actually indicative of his original intent on top of the incongruous circumstance that he had already left the employ of Dargaud and &quot;Pilote&quot; in 1972 as before-mentioned. A baffled Charlier had declared on a prior occasion: &quot;I have written a fictitious biography on Blueberry, accompanied by photographs found in American archives, and the whole world fell for it!&quot;, having already stated on an even earlier occasion: &quot;To this very day, because of &quot;Ballade pour un cercueil&quot; in which we gave Blueberry with a photographs illuminated biography, I still receive letters from readers – not from kids mind you, but from grownups – asking how on Earth we have managed to track down the real Blueberry. There are people who take it as real fact&quot;. The photos were indeed authentic, though their captions were not. To complete the appearance of a bonafide in-universe biography, a Civil War-era style group portrait, featuring Blueberry and flanked by the by Charlier mentioned comic artists, was included, ostensibly recently discovered and from the hand of American artist Peter Glay, but in reality created by Pierre Tabary under the pseudonym. Tabary, brother of Jean, was a French book illustrator of some renown himself, also working for &quot;Pilote&quot; as illustrator for their magazine editorials at the time. Incidentally, a salient detail was that events, as related in the biography, in Blueberry&#x27;s life directly upon war&#x27;s end, but before he arrived in the Far West, eventually became those of &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot;, the other Giraud/Charlier western.

J.M. Lofficier has translated the biography in English, specifically for inclusion in the Graphitti Designs anthology collection (it was not featured in the originating Epic/ComCat editions), published in the fourth volume of the collection, &quot;Moebius #4&quot;. Lofficier however, took it upon himself to slightly edit Charlier&#x27;s original text in order to reflect Blueberry&#x27;s life as featured in the post-1974 publications (despite being reprinted numerous times, not only in French but in other languages as well, Charlier himself has never revisited his original text again), and as such it is not an entirely faithful translation as some elements were added, whereas some others were omitted, such as the aforementioned notion of a fully rehabilitated and to captain promoted Blueberry ultimately heading a unit of Apache scouts.

==Legacy==
===Second tier &quot;Blueberry&quot;-related spin-off series===
These concern spin-off creations that have very strong ties with the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, but which differ in this respect from the aforementioned sub-series that neither Blueberry himself, nor any of the major secondary characters, appear in these creations.

====&quot;Jim Cutlass&quot;====

Even though neither Blueberry nor any of the major secondary characters of the main series has made an appearance, or are referenced to, in this &quot;bande dessinée&quot; (BD) series, &quot;&quot; is of all the second-tier spin-off series the one that is most inextricably associated with the main series, even more so than all the hereafter mentioned productions – and even more so than the &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; intermezzo series in fact, due to that series complete lack of Jean-Michel Charlier involvement. In effect, the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; series exclusively owes its very existence to the &quot;Blueberry&quot; main series.

It was actually the 1974-1979 &quot;Blueberry&quot; royalties conflict that lay at the very heart of the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; series origin history. Two years after the conflict had started and in which Georges Dargaud had stubbornly refused to budge, he, acting like it was business as usual, brazenly asked Charlier for a &quot;Blueberry&quot; short story for a Western special he had planned as a June 1976 side publication of &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine. Charlier however, had no intention whatsoever to add yet another &quot;Blueberry&quot; title to a body of work that was already under contention, and found, as expected, his co-creator Giraud in full agreement. &quot;The &quot;Blueberry&quot; magazine rights, &quot; Giraud had declared, &quot;were a year before I embarked on &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; the subject of a dispute between the &quot;Pilote&quot; people and I. When they afterwards asked me for my contribution to a western special issue of &quot;Pilote&quot;, the relationships had somewhat improved, but I was dead-set on not wanting &quot;Blueberry&quot; to appear in &quot;Pilote&quot; ever again. We were already in negotiations with other magazines for that &quot;bande dessinée&quot;. It was therefore essentially a copyright issue that made Charlier and I invent another western hero.&quot; The primary reason for both creators to give in to Dargaud&#x27;s request after all with a western short story, can only be construed as a token of goodwill of not wanting to shut the door on their parent publisher permanently, thereby leaving some wriggling room for future negotiations. As implied by Giraud however, Charlier took great care that the story copyrights were covered by his EdiFrance/EdiPresse syndicate agency&#x27;s magazine exemption clause – he had already reactivated two years earlier to have &quot;Angel Face&quot; appear in &quot;Nouveau Tintin&quot; instead of &quot;Pilote&quot; –, meaning that the two creators retained full ownership of their new creation, and &quot;not&quot; publisher Dargaud where its &quot;Blueberry&quot; ownership had been the very root cause of the conflict in the first place.

As intended, the 17-page short story, entitled &quot;Mississippi River&quot;, appeared in the &quot;Special Wéstern&quot; companion issue of &quot;Pilote&quot; number 25 of June 1976, which had by then become a monthly magazine. At that time still lacking a series title, as it was originally intended as a one-off publication, the story involved a northerner who very shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War travels to New Orleans, Louisiana in order to claim his inheritance, a plantation. On his way, he meets several firebrand southern secessionists and as a decided abolitionist runs into serious troubles with several of them after helping a slave escape. For &quot;Mississippi River&quot; Giraud used the very same, what Charlier had coined &quot;less convoluted&quot;, art style he had already used for his &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; short stories as created for &quot;Super Pocket Pilote&quot; eight years earlier, even though the plates for the &quot;Special Wéstern&quot; issue were twice the size of those of &quot;Super Pocket Pilote&quot;.

Three years later, the &quot;Blueberry&quot; royalties conflict had flared up again in full force, and Jim Cutlass found himself quite unexpectedly smack in the middle of the conflict, front and center. Charlier and Giraud had decided to turn up the pressure on publisher Dargaud by having the long and eagerly awaited &quot;Broken Nose&quot; &quot;Blueberry&quot; outing pre-published in &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; magazine instead of &quot;Pilote&quot;. In addition, they had decided to revisit their 1976 short story and expand it into a full-blown 60-page story, and have it pre-published in &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; magazine a short while later as well, in order to make it crystal clear to publisher Dargaud that the &quot;Blueberry&quot; creators had options. In an effort to turn up the heat on Dargaud even further, the album was already released by the by Giraud co-founded publisher Les Humanoïdes Associés before the pre-publication in &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; had even run its course, &quot;and&quot; before Dargaud had the chance to release the &quot;Broken Nose&quot; album. As already related, the pressure had no effect on Dargaud and the &quot;Blueberry&quot; creators left their parent publisher – definitively in Charlier&#x27;s case, as it turned out – for greener pastures elsewhere. Incidentally, neither &quot;Broken Nose&quot; nor &quot;Mississippi River&quot; saw publication in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; though, the US counterpart of &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;.

The original short story was either by coincidence or by design written by Charlier as an open-ended story, which made it suitable to expand into a full-blown history. The story picks up after the original short – which was republished completely unaltered – with Cutlass returning to Louisiana right after the war in which he had served as a Union lieutenant, to find his inheritance in a dilapidated state, only inhabited by his cousin Carolyn Grayson, his co-inheritor of the plantation, who had suffered greatly at the hands of Union marauders during the war. In his efforts to revitalize the plantation, Cutlass has to deal with all the woes that had befallen the South directly upon war&#x27;s end, carpet baggers, marauding ex-slaves, the KKK, looting deserters from both armies, as well as the surviving enemies he had made just before the war, only to be embezzled out of his inheritance in the end by his cousin Carolyn, after which he has no other choice but to return to the army. Charlier was inspired in part by the 1939 classic movie &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, but mostly by his own &quot;Blueberry&quot; biography he had written five years earlier, as &quot;all&quot; immediate post-war events that befell Cutlass he had originally envisioned to be those of Blueberry himself. Though like Blueberry an anti-hero, Charlier took care to make the ginger-headed Cutlass as different as possible, making him in essence a deeply flawed self-serving loser, completely unencumbered by Blueberry&#x27;s sense of morality and justice. In addition, none of Cutlass&#x27;s plans seemed to work out as he also lacked his colleague&#x27;s on his feet thinking in tight spots, only prevailing through blind luck.

Realizing full well that the publication of the expanded story was time sensitive in order to have it out before the &quot;Broken Nose&quot; album release, Giraud was forced to produce the art at a breakneck pace, one page a day. To do so, he was forced to create his art in a seemingly even less &quot;convoluted&quot; manner than he already had employed for the original short. He stated in 1982, &quot; Well, that BD needed an adapted drawing technique. I had to produce one page a day!! If you have to work at such speed, great detailing goes out the window and you can not reason out everything beforehand. Spontaneity and clarity are all-important in this story.&quot; Even though there is a difference of day and night between the art of this story and &quot;Broken Nose&quot;, considerable thought did go into page layout and readability to make the story easily accessible, even more so than the very &quot;convoluted&quot; &quot;Broken Nose&quot; in which the meticulously detailed &quot;Mœbius&quot; artwork style had made its appearance.

Fans were totally taken by surprise by the unexpected publication of &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot;, but also puzzled why it was created in the first place. Not privy to the behind-the-scenes going-ons at Dargaud, an incorrect, by French BD critic Jean-Pierre Mercier initiated, rumor started to make the rounds that both &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; publisher Les Humanoïdes Associés and Giraud were in desperate need of a financial injection, and that a western &quot;quickie&quot; by Giraud was the only way to get it. While Mercier was right in his assessment of the publisher&#x27;s financial difficulties at that time, he was completely led astray by a flippant and prosaic statement Giraud had made around the same time he had made his &quot;copyright issue&quot; statement above. He then concurrently stated in another interview, &quot;I started with &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; because I needed the money to pay for the furnishing of my new house.&quot; Incidentally, Giraud had already made a contemporary similar flippant remark in regard to &quot;Broken Nose&quot;.

Still, &quot;Blueberry&quot; fans, pleased with another Giraud western, took to the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; publication with a fervor, and the album did quite well in sales. Over time, it eventually saw almost as many foreign language translations as any outing of the &quot;Blueberry&quot; main series had, which included one in English. However, since the album failed in its primary objective, &quot;i.e.&quot; move Dargaud into the creators&#x27; desired direction, the creators deemed it no longer worthwhile to pursue the series any further.


Because of its failure as a means of pressure, &quot;Mississippi River&quot; remained a one-shot publication for little over a decade. However, Jean-Michel Charlier had been busy since 1987 to revive most of his older BD creations for intended publication in a new, yet to be launched BD magazine, beyond the ones he had already revived/created for Koralle/Novedi, explaining the pile of scripts Giraud saw on Charlier&#x27;s desk when he visited him six months before his death. One of these older creations Charlier had intended to revive, was &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot;. Acutely aware that Giraud had his plate full with not only &quot;Blueberry&quot;, but also his various &quot;Mœbius&quot; endeavors, which included &quot;The Incal&quot; series, Charlier went in search for a replacement artist for the series, which he initially thought to have found in the Italian artist Gaetano Liberatore, who at that time was riding high on his anarchistic &quot;RanXerox&quot; BD. An arranged meeting with French artist though, eventually made Charlier decide to select him as the new &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; artist.

Giraud was not entirely left out the loop as it was his own publishing house Aedena, he had co-founded in 1984, where Charlier with the Aedena founders had planned to launch the BD magazine &quot;Hugh!&quot;, in which his revived BD series were to be published, &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; among them. And it explained the trial run &quot;Rossi: Jim Cutlass&quot; art mini-portfolio Annestay was referring to in the quote box above at Aedena, which thereby became one of the very last releases of that publisher in 1987. The for Charlier inconvenient Aedena bankruptcy also served as a rationale why he subsequently approached Fabrice Giger in 1988 – behind Giraud&#x27;s back this time – who ironically, had just bought Les Humanoïdes Associés, the very same Humanos &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; was intended to be taken away from.

When Annestay eventually called Rossi to offer him the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; series, he &quot;(...)needed about a quarter of a second to think it through, and say yes immediately&quot;. He was motivated to do so because, &quot;[t]here was only one &quot;Cutlass&quot; album, but mostly because it was not &quot;Blueberry&quot;. I have always loved the Cutlass character in a hot and intimate manner, because he is so full of temperament and passion, because he has a pathos that is less apparent in Blueberry. And because I loved the loose art style. And in this roundabout manner I was able to meet Jean - professionally.&quot; Rossi incidentally, was no stranger to offbeat western BDs, as he had already created his own 1982-1987 &quot;&quot; series which ran for four volumes before he, due to the mediocre measure of commercial success, decided to drop it in order to take on &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot;.

Shortly before Charlier&#x27;s death, he was persuaded by Rossi to select Casterman as the publisher of the revived &quot;Cutlass&quot; series. &quot;It was I who pushed Jean-Michel Charlier to go with Casterman! Jean Annestay found himself at Casterman after the bankruptcy of Aedena. The &quot;Hugh!&quot; magazine project did not see the light of day and Jean-Michel wanted to stop with Novedi. He no longer wanted to go with Dargaud but he had a contract offer with Alpen. I didn&#x27;t know this publisher, the future Humanoïdes Associés [&quot;sic.&quot;], and we negotiated with the Casterman people; It went very well and we ended up with this completely atypical BD in their monthly &quot;À Suivre&quot; magazine, like &quot;Julius&quot; [note: a contemporary Rossi non-western BD series] had been in &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot;! But they liked it, did a little promotion and believed in it! This is how &quot;Cutlass&quot; escaped this intention of Fabrice Giger and Humanos to lay claim on all the Charlier material.&quot; Despite his very advanced negotiations with Giger, Charlier conceded in this particular case, because of his staunch conviction that &quot;bande dessinées&quot; were first and foremost magazine publications, which Alpen had not in place – nor would they ever have.

Charlier&#x27;s death on 10 July 1989 delayed the debut at Casterman of the second &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; outing. At the time of his death, Charlier&#x27;s scenario, he had endowed with the working title &quot;K.K.K.&quot;, was finished up until and including page 36, after which it was up to Giraud to finish it, much like he had to do with &quot;Arizona Love&quot;. Actually, it was Rossi who wrote a story synopsis for the remaining pages 37–64 and who asked Charlier&#x27;s widow if he could proceed. After gaining her permission, he sought out Giraud for further advice and was given four pages with detailed dialog and scenario notes after which Rossi was able to rearrange the preliminary page layouts into the final ones. The freedom he got from Giraud became the template for their future cooperation together. Neither were the negotiations with Casterman finalized yet, and Giraud in particular made use of the opportunity to hammer out a very advantageous deal for himself. He secured a compensation of 5,000 FF (roughly US$587 in 1989 prices) per page and an increase of his album royalties to 13%, which was double the then-going industry rate. He was able to do this by playing off Giger&#x27;s Humanoïdes Associés and Casterman against each other, demonstrating he had learned well from his late writing partner, but arguably &quot;also&quot; allowing his displeasure at Charlier&#x27;s surreptitious negotiations with Giger to vent.

After the completion of the last 30 pages, the by Giraud to &quot;L&#x27;Homme de la Nouvelle-Orleans&quot; (&quot;The Man from New-Orleans&quot;) re-titled story, started its belated serialized pre-publication in &quot;À suivre&quot;″s July 1990 issue no. 150, accompanied by a proudly written two-page editorial (pp. 45–46).

Jean-Michel Charlier/Jean Giraud and 
*2: &quot;L&#x27;Homme de la Nouvelle-Orleans&quot; (Casterman, 1991/01, )

The publication of &quot;À Suivre&quot; was terminated by Casterman in 1997, which also meant the termination of the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; serialized magazine pre-publication. The last two series outings were therefore released directly in album format. As explored above Giraud had intended to incorporate Blueberry into the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; series, but this was met by an immediate veto by Charlier heir Philippe because he abhorred Giraud&#x27;s &quot;New Age&quot; predilections; in the later volumes of the series voodoo elements, dream sequences, and Afro-American sorcery started to play an ever increasing role in the story lines. And while Philippe Charlier was unable to veto the series proper as it too fell under the &quot;Blueberry&quot; &quot;longest survivor contracts&quot; Giraud had signed with his father, he was entitled to veto any &quot;brand extension&quot; that did not meet with his approval. And even though it did enjoy a certain following, being in some countries reprinted to this day, the series – its last two volumes particularly – was unable to achieve anything near the commercial success of the series that had spawned it, and the two artists decided to throw in the towel after volume 7 was released in 1999, leaving the original creators&#x27; debut album the series&#x27; most popular and successful one.

*6: &quot;Colts, Fantômes et Zombies&quot; (Casterman, 1998/10, )
*7: &quot;Nuit noire&quot; (Casterman, 1999/09, )

It has not hurt Rossi&#x27;s BD career however, as he did create several successful series afterwards, including his latter-day &quot;&quot; western, which featured supernatural overtones.

====&quot;Die Frau mit dem Silberstern&quot;====
This German-language comic, which translates as &quot;The Woman with the Silver Star&quot;, was created in its entirety by German comics artist Martin Frei. It debuted in September 2021 and concerned a sequel to &quot;The Man with the Silver Star&quot; and revolves around the later adventures of the two major protagonistic secondary characters introduced in that outing, the teacher Katie March – the German series&#x27; titular &quot;Frau&quot;, or &quot;Woman&quot; – and the former deputy (but now full-fledged) marshal Dusty. Save for Katie March&#x27;s single flashback memory at the start of the story, Blueberry does not make any kind of further appearance in the two-part mini-series. It is unclear however, if Frei had obtained legal permission from the Charlier and Giraud heirs to proceed with his creation. Still, this was actually the kind of creation that came very close to what Philippe Charlier had in mind nine years earlier as part of the by him envisioned grand, overall &quot;Blueberry&quot;-franchise.
*1: &quot;Leutnant Blueskull&quot; (, issues 267, 09/21 - 270, 12/21, )
*2: &quot;Der Tod des Leutnants&quot; (, issues 283, 01/23 - 286, 04/23, )
A 120-page hardcover omnibus collection () was announced by the publisher for a May 2023 album release under its &quot;Blattgold&quot;-imprint as &quot;Die Ballade der Kate March: Die Frau mit dem Silberstern&quot;. Likewise endowed with an elaborate editorial, the omnibus was designed to fit in seamlessly in the &quot;Die Blueberry Chroniken&quot; format, the aforementioned 2006-2017 German omnibus collection from Egmont, as its volume 20.

However, and even though the publisher itself had reported in an April 3, 2023 posting on their own ZackMagazine facebook page that the publication was ready for release directly after Easter, no such release had after six months been forthcoming after all. It turned out that the publisher had indeed run afoul of legalities with the copyright owners when they confirmed in June on their own monthly editorial news site that it was in effect Philippe Charlier himself who had raised the legal objections, resulting in the publisher withholding the omnibus&#x27; release as well as ordering the entire printing to be shredded in order to avoid being taken to court – save for a handful of limited edition copies that were already delivered to customers, who had pre-ordered them directly from the publisher before the ban came into effect and on top of a few regular copies illegally saved by diligent publishing staff (some of which subsequently sold for considerable collector prices on German eBay). The publisher stated that, because licensing issues had been settled with parent publisher Dargaud, the Charlier heirs must have known about the comic and its serialized pre-publication for two years without raising any objections, thereby implying that they had intentionally waited until the album was printed and ready for dissemination, before taking legal steps after all. Right before legal proceedings were initiated, Moasic-Zack had just sold the publication rights to Dutch publisher HUM! for the into that language translated version, slated for a 2024 release.

===Homage series===
At the start of the 2010s, French &quot;Bande Dessinée&quot; publishers introduced a new concept into their release line-ups, that of the homage, or tribute series. Goal of those series was to give (predominantly) younger and less established artists a chance to apply their own spin to classic BD series, either by art, scenario, or both. These one-story works were explicitly intended as one-off projects encompassing at the very most two volumes only, and were most definitely neither intended as a continuation of a series nor as a spin-off series, and required the express permission of the original creators or their heirs. Even though purist fans consider the phenomenon with much reservations, the new concept caught on and several classic series have in the meantime received what the French call &quot;XYZ [vu] par...&quot; (=&quot;XYZ [as seen] by...&quot;) treatment. One of the first classic series to see outings in the format had been &quot;Valérian and Laureline&quot; by Giraud&#x27;s lifelong friend Jean-Claude Mézières.

====Sfar and Blain====
In November 2019 Dargaud published a homage book made by the duo Joann Sfar and Christophe Blain, after Isabelle Giraud had unexpectedly given permission to embark on a new &quot;Blueberry&quot; project for the very first, and as of 2025 only, time since her husband&#x27;s death. As if to underscore the uniqueness of the occasion, the duo was permitted to create a two-volume album story as &quot;Blueberry&quot;″s first homage release. Their two-volume story deals with a by white settlers incited Apache uprising and is set between the albums &quot;Trail of the Navajo&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Silver Star&quot;. The first third-party &quot;Blueberry&quot; interpretation series was launched with much fanfare and has seen several translations – albeit in far less languages that the three origin series –, to wit in Croatian, Dutch, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish.

For undisclosed reasons, the conclusion of the two-volume story was delayed for over half a decade, with all involved having observed a complete information black-out on the matter. It was only in the autumn of 2024 that it was finally revealed that its release was expected for April 2025.

*1: &quot;Amertume Apache&quot; (Dargaud, 11/2019, )

===Film adaptations===
A 2004 film adaptation, &quot;Blueberry: L&#x27;expérience secrète&quot;(U.S. release title is &quot;Renegade&quot;), was directed by Jan Kounen and starred Vincent Cassel in the lead role, with Giraud himself making a walk-on cameo appearance at the beginning of the movie. Only loosely based on &quot;The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Mine&quot;-diptych, many purist fans were appalled by this film for its prominent depiction of, and reliance on, Native-American mysticism and shamanism, as already hinted at in the film&#x27;s subtitle. Giraud though, has expressed pride of Kounen&#x27;s film in the special features of the 2004 French 2-disc &quot;Edition Collector&quot; DVD, which was not that surprising as it closely chimed with what he had envisioned for his own &quot;Fort Mescalero&quot; movie, and &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; comic projects. Philippe Charlier on the other hand, was livid when he was presented the final product, and demanded his father&#x27;s credit removed from the film – which did not happen incidentally, as this under French copy right laws would have also entailed him forfeiting his share of the film royalties he had already received. Kounen himself, unperturbed by Charlier Jr&#x27;s objections, had stated: &quot;My film is a &quot;Blueberry&quot; album as though it had been drawn by Mœbius&quot;. In regard to the fan criticism he commented that &quot;fans are uncreative and aggressive, they want us to serve them, they are a real plague for a filmmaker&quot;.

Three prior attempts to bring &quot;Blueberry&quot; to the silver screen had fallen through two decades earlier; in 1986 Charlier disclosed how American actor Martin Kove had actually already been signed to play the titular role – with whom Kove shared a remarkable resemblance at the time – for the first two early 1980s attempts, which were both based on the &quot;Confederate Gold&quot; cycle. It was Kove who introduced the two Blueberry creators to would-be American film producers on both occasions. The first attempt failed because American producers intended a complete script rewrite turning Blueberry into a completely unrecognizable standard western. The second attempt suffered even worse as its American producer, &quot;inspired&quot; by the success of the 1981 movie &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, wanted to turn the project into a &quot;Raiders&quot; 2.0, set in the Yucatán peninsula, complete with Aztec warriors and pyramids and featuring a daring escape in a zeppelin-type airship. Helped by his background in law, an aghast Charlier instructed Giraud to sabotage the project as much as possible and the &quot; Blueberry&quot; creators eventually managed to buy back the rights for US$30,000. Already mentioned by Charlier in his 1986 interview, Kove had even traveled to Europe to shoot some test-footage scenes from the comic series in this role in order to entice potential investors, and that some of it was still in his possession as it turned out decades later. Convinced that the project was a viable one, Kove has also revealed in 2014 how he, together with the two &quot;Blueberry&quot; creators, had tried to save it by putting up his own money as well when the project was falling apart due to arguments about funding among European/American would-be producers – to no avail however, which was a slightly different version of events as had been related by Charlier.

The third (and last) attempt concerned a European only endeavor, which had at one point actually involved Sergio Leone, according to Charlier, and was this time around conceived from the outset as a limited television movie series, a format quite popular in Europe (Mediterranean Europe in particular) in the 1980s, and slated to be produced by the Swiss/French/Belgian production/distribution company Technisonor, more faithfully adhering – than the later 2004 film adaptation – to the main comic series and intended to span the &quot;Iron Horse&quot; through the &quot;Rehabilitation&quot; story cycles. That 1983 attempt petered out without so much as a whimper, most likely due to lack of interest on the part of European investors.

===Exhibitions===
After Giraud had returned to France pursuant his extended stay in the United States, generic interest in his work steadily grew and resulted in an increasing number of latter-day exhibitions at museums and conventions, featuring his original art. Due to his international renown as &quot;Mœbius&quot;, virtually all of these exhibitions focused on his work as such, even if &quot;Blueberry&quot; art was included in some of them. Nonetheless, at least four such exhibitions were known to have been Western/&quot;Blueberry&quot; specific.
* December 1995: «Wanted: Blueberry» exposition at the Arthaud Grenette bookstore, Grenoble, also featuring original &quot;Blueberry&quot; art by Colin Wilson. Both he and Jean Giraud attended the opening on 1 December, making themselves also available for book signings. Prior to the opening a promotional leaflet was disseminated by the bookstore (&quot;Arthaud &quot;BD News&quot;&quot;, issue 1, November 1995), featuring a three-page interview with Giraud.
* 19 September-9 October 1996: «Jean Giraud Blueberry» exposition at the Stardom Gallery, Paris, for the occasion of the upcoming release of the &quot;Blueberry&#x27;s&quot; artbook by Stardom – Giraud&#x27;s own publishing house/art gallery. The below-mentioned 1997 documentary was the registration of events surrounding the release, including the exhibition.
* 15 March-15 April 2005: «JEAN GIRAUD: Exposition de dessins et planches originales de &quot;DUST&quot; le nouvel album de Blueberry aux editions Dargaud», Galerie Arludik, Paris, France; small exhibition for the occasion of the 28th &quot;Blueberry&quot; album release.

The series has received (world) wide recognition in the comics community, and the chief factor for Giraud receiving his first recorded international award in 1972. Listed are only those rewards, the author(s) received specifically for &quot;Blueberry&quot;, as Giraud in particular received an additional multitude of awards and nominations for his work as &quot;Mœbius&quot; from 1977 onward, including awards encompassing his entire body of works.

*1997: Eisner Award nomination for &quot;The Blueberry Saga #1: The Confederate Gold&quot; published by Mojo Press, in the category &quot;Best Archival Collection&quot;.
* 2000: Sproing Award for &quot;Blueberry&quot;: &quot;Geronimo&quot; in the category &quot;Best Translated Strips&quot;, Giraud only.
While Giraud has garnered universal praise and acclaim for his work as &quot;Moebius&quot;, &quot;Blueberry&quot; has always remained his most successful and most recognized work in mainland Europe, despite its artist developing somewhat of a love/hate relationship with his co-creation in later life, which was exemplified by him regularly taking an extended leave of absence from his co-creation. That &quot;Blueberry&quot; has always remained his primary source of income, allowing him to fully indulge in his artistic endeavors as Moebius, was admitted as such by Giraud as early as 1979: &quot;If an album of Moebius is released, about 10.000 people are interested. A &quot;Blueberry&quot; album sells at least 100.000 copies [in France]&quot;, and as late as 2005, &quot;&quot;Blueberry&quot; is in some ways the &quot;sponsor&quot; of Moebius, for years now&quot;.

<text>Yitzchak Hutner (; 1906November 28, 1980), also known as Isaac Hutner, was an American Orthodox rabbi and rosh yeshiva (dean).

Originally from Warsaw, Hutner was the long-time dean of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, New York, an older institution that grew under his leadership. Hutner&#x27;s pedagogic style was a blend of the Hasidic and Misnagdic elements of his own family&#x27;s origins. His discourses, called &quot;ma&#x27;amarim&quot;, contained elements of a Talmudic discourse, a Hasidic Tish and a philosophic lecture. Although his title was rosh yeshiva, Hutner&#x27;s leadership style more closely resembled that of a rebbe who expected fealty from his followers.

In his later years, Hutner established Yeshiva Pachad Yitzchok in Jerusalem, which is named after his own magnum opus. On one of his trips there, Hutner&#x27;s plane was seized by Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorists in the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings, which he survived.

== Early life ==
Hutner was born in Warsaw, Poland, to a family with both Ger Hasidic and non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewish roots. As a child he received private instruction in Torah and Talmud. As a teenager he was enrolled in the Slabodka yeshiva in Lithuania, headed by Nosson Tzvi Finkel, where he was known as the &quot;Warsaw Illui&quot; (Genius of Warsaw). His younger sister was Rachela Hutner (1909–2008).

In 1925, having obtained a solid grounding in Talmud, Hutner joined a group from the Slabodka yeshiva that established the Hebron Yeshiva in Mandatory Palestine. He studied there until 1929, narrowly escaping the 1929 Hebron massacre because he was away for the weekend. Hutner then returned to Warsaw to visit his parents. He then moved to Germany, to study philosophy at the University of Berlin, where he befriended Joseph B. Soloveitchik and Menachem Mendel Schneerson, two future rabbinical leaders then studying in Berlin. In 1932, he authored a book called &quot;Torat HaNazir&quot;.

In 1933, Hutner married Masha Lipshitz in Kobryn. She was born in Slutsk and raised in the United States. That same year, the couple traveled to Mandatory Palestine, where they remained for about a year, and completed his research and writing of his &quot;Kovetz Ha&#x27;aros&quot; on Hillel ben Eliakim&#x27;s commentary on &quot;midrash sifra.&quot;

== Rabbinic and teaching career ==

In March 1934 Hutner moved to the United States (his wife having preceded him by six months) and settled in Brooklyn, where Hutner joined the faculty of the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School. Sometime between 1935 and 1936 he was appointed office manager of the newly established high school division of the Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin known as Mesivta Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin. 

In 1940, after receiving permission from the rosh yeshiva, Yaakov Moshe Shurkin, he began to give a class to the 4th year of the post high school program. Founded in 1904, it was the oldest elementary yeshiva in Brooklyn. Over the years he built up the yeshiva&#x27;s post-high school beth midrash division and became Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin&#x27;s senior rosh yeshiva (dean). In this effort he also received the help of Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz who headed Brooklyn&#x27;s Yeshiva Torah Vodaas. Hutner was able to construct an environment that produced young Talmudic scholars in the model of their compatriots in Eastern Europe. By 1940 he had established a post-high-school beth midrash with hundreds of students.

At Chaim Berlin, students were allowed to combine their yeshiva study with afternoon and evening classes at college, mainly Brooklyn College and later Touro College. Hutner took great pride in the secular accomplishments of his students insofar as they fit into his vision of a material world governed by the principles of a spiritual Torah way of life. Thus, many alumni of Hutner&#x27;s yeshiva have attained success as attorneys, accountants, doctors, and in information technology. One of his closest disciples, Israel Kirzner, is an economist who edited Hutner&#x27;s written works, &quot;Pachad Yitzchok&quot;. Many of Hutner&#x27;s disciples earned doctorates, often with his blessing and guidance. This includes his daughter and only child, Bruria David, who obtained her PhD at Columbia University&#x27;s department of philosophy as a student of Salo Baron. She subsequently founded and became the dean of Beth Jacob Jerusalem, a prominent Jewish women&#x27;s seminary that caters to young women from Haredi families in the United States. Her dissertation discussed the dual role Zvi Hirsch Chajes as both a traditionalist and &quot;maskil&quot; (follower of the enlightenment). The list also includes Ahron Soloveichik (law) rosh yeshiva, Aharon Lichtenstein (literature) rosh yeshiva, Yitzhak Aharon Korff (law, international law and diplomacy), and Yehuda (Leo) Levi (physics) professor and rector. 

In the 1950s, Hutner established a &quot;kollel&quot; (post graduate division for married scholars) to continue their in-depth Talmudical studies. This school, Kollel Gur Aryeh, was one of the first of its kind in America. Many of his students became prominent educational, outreach, and pulpit rabbis. He stayed in touch with them and was involved in major communal policy decision-making as he worked through his network of students in positions of leadership.

Hutner established Yeshiva Pachad Yitzchok in Har Nof, Jerusalem, which he named for his book of the same name. He died in 1980, and was buried in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery in East Jerusalem.

=== Methodology ===
Hutner&#x27;s methodology and style was complex, controversial, and difficult to pigeonhole. While placing great emphasis on intellectually penetrating Talmudic study and analysis, emotionally he veered towards the Hasidic-style, and more-so than his Lithuanian-style colleagues reared as Misnagdim could tolerate. Ultimately though, he saw himself more as a traditional Litvish rosh yeshiva. 

The core of Hutner&#x27;s synthesis of different schools of Jewish thought was rooted in his studies of the teachings of Judah Loew ben Bezalel (1525–1609) a scholar and mystic known as the &quot;Maharal of Prague&quot;. Various pillars of Hutner&#x27;s thought system were likely the works of the Vilna Gaon and Moshe Chaim Luzzatto. He would only allude in the most general ways to other great &quot;mekubalim&quot; (mystics) such as the Baal Shem Tov, the &quot;Ari&quot;, Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Mordechai Yosef Leiner of Izbitz and many other great Hasidic masters, as he did with the works of Kabbalah such as the Zohar.

Hutner initiated a number of changes in Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin that differed greatly from the &quot;mussar&quot; (ethics) yeshiva practice in Slabodka. He abolished the half-hour learning session in &quot;mussar&quot; and replaced it with one of ten or fifteen minutes.

Hutner viewed secular studies as essential for attending college, learning a profession and becoming self-supporting. He obtained, together with Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz, a charter from the New York State Board of Regents to set up a combined yeshiva and college. However, this plan was dropped at the insistence of Aharon Kotler.

Hutner developed a style of celebrating Shabbat and the Jewish holidays by delivering a type of discourse known as a &quot;ma&#x27;amar&quot;. It was a combination of Talmudic discourse, Hasidic celebration (&quot;tish&quot;), philosophic lecture, group singing, and when possible, like on Purim, a ten-piece band was brought in as accompaniment. Many times there was singing and dancing all night. All of this, together with the respect to his authority that he demanded, induced in his students an obedience and something of a &quot;heightened consciousness&quot; that passed into their lives transforming them into literal Hasidim of their rosh yeshiva, who in turn encouraged this by eventually personally donning Hasidic garb (&quot;levush&quot;) and behaving like something of a synthesis between a rosh yeshiva and a rebbe. He also instructed some of his students to do likewise.

== Relationships with other rabbis ==
During his stay in Palestine, Hutner visited Abraham Isaac Kook, the first chief rabbi of Palestine, to whom he was distantly related. Hutner eventually became a member of the non-Zionist Haredi Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (Council of Torah Sages) of Agudath Israel of America following his immigration to the United States.

Hutner&#x27;s work &quot;Pachad Yitzchok&quot; contains no overt reference to Kook. A few of Hutner&#x27;s early students recall Hutner&#x27;s lengthy comments regarding Kook. Eliezer Waldman said that Hutner told them that &quot;Rav Kook was 20 times as great as those who opposed him&quot;. Similarly, Moshe Zvi Neria heard Hutner say that &quot;if I would not have met Rav Kook, I would be lacking 50% of myself&quot;.

While staying in Berlin, Hutner developed a friendship with Menachem Mendel Schneerson and Joseph B. Soloveitchik. Hutner referred to Soloveitchik as a &quot;gadol&quot; (foremost Torah scholar of the time) and to Schneerson as &quot;tzadik hador&quot; (righteous one of the generation), while at other times saying some negative things about the latter. Nevertheless, the three maintained close personal relations throughout their lives, though each differed markedly in Torah &quot;hashkafa&quot; (weltanschauung), developing a unique bridge and synthesis between the Eastern European world-view and a Western European way of thinking. This enabled them to serve successfully as spiritual leaders after each of them immigrated to the United States of America.

Citing an anonymous source, Hillel Goldberg reports that Hutner became a fierce critic of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic group and the &quot;personality cult built up around&quot; Schneerson. Hutner purposefully moved up his Hanukkah &quot;ma&#x27;amar&quot; to preempt his students from attending Schneerson&#x27;s Yud Tes Kislev farbrengen. Still, Hutner corresponded regularly with Schneerson throughout his lifetime on a variety of &quot;halakhic&quot; (Jewish law), Hasidic and kabbalistic subjects, and occasionally sought his blessing. Hutner also had several lengthy private meetings with Schneerson.

Hutner appointed Soloveitchik&#x27;s younger brother, whom he had tutored in Warsaw, Ahron Soloveichik (later to head his own yeshiva in Skokie near Chicago, Illinois), as head of his own Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin. Ahron Soloveichik completed a Doctorate in law at New York University at the same time that he lectured in Hutner&#x27;s Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin.

In the early 1940s, Hutner asked a friend from Slabodka, Saul Lieberman, to become a dean-Talmudical lecturer in Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin. Lieberman instead accepted an offer from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), the seminary of Conservative Judaism.

Hutner had a number of disagreements with some of the religious scholars who taught in his yeshiva. These disputes were usually not over ideology, but about positions in the school. He eased out many of the older rabbis who were his contemporaries in favor of his disciples. Rabbis Prusskin (a first cousin to his wife), Goldstone, Shurkin, Snow, Avrohom Asher Zimmerman and others are among them. Though Hutner was, by all accounts, quite steadfast in his opinions, he was not above begging forgiveness from those he had slighted, even when they had initiated attacks on him, and adopting a conciliatory tone.

Hutner appointed Slabodka yeshiva educated Avigdor Miller as the &quot;mashgiach ruchani&quot; (spiritual mentor and supervisor) of the yeshiva. After the yeshiva relocated to Far Rockaway, New York in the 1960s, Miller resigned from his position due to the difficulties a daily commute from Brooklyn entailed.

==TWA hijacking==
In the late 1960s he began to visit Israel again, planning to build a new yeshiva there. On 6 September 1970, he and his wife, daughter, and son-in-law Yonasan David were returning to New York on TWA Flight 741 when their flight was hijacked by the PFLP Palestinian terrorist organization. The terrorists freed the non-Jewish passengers and held the Jewish passengers hostage on the plane for one week, after which the women and children were released and sent to Cyprus. The hijacked airplanes were subsequently detonated. The remaining 40-plus Jewish men – including Hutner, David, and two students accompanying Hutner, Meir Fund and Yaakov Drillman – and male flight crew continued to be held hostage in and around Amman, Jordan; Hutner was held alone in an isolated location while Jews around the world prayed for his safe release. The terrorists tried to cut off his beard, but were stopped by their commanders. Hutner was reunited with the rest of the hostages on 18 September, and was finally released on 26 September and flown together with his family members to Nicosia, Cyprus. Israeli Knesset Member Menachem Porush chartered a private plane to meet the Hutners in Nicosia, and Willie Frommer, a former student, gave him his own shirt and &quot;tallit katan&quot;, since Hutner&#x27;s &quot;tallit&quot;, &quot;tefillin&quot;, shirt, jacket and hat had been confiscated during his three-week ordeal. On 28 September Hutner and his group were flown back to New York via Europe, and were home just in time for the first night of Rosh Hashana.

== Published work ==
In 1938 Hutner published a short booklet of &quot;halakhic&quot; decisions sourced in the Sifra but not cited in the Babylonian Talmud. Many years later, he published what is considered to be his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, which he named &quot;Pachad Yitzchok&quot; (&quot;Fear [of] Isaac&quot;, meaning the God whom Isaac [had] feared). He called his outlook &quot;Hilchot Deot Vechovot Halevavot&quot; (&quot;Laws [of] &#x27;Ideas&#x27; and &#x27;Duties [of the] Heart&#x27;&quot;) and wrote in a poetic modern-style Hebrew reminiscent of his original mentor Abraham Isaac Kook&#x27;s style, even though almost all of Hutner&#x27;s original lectures were delivered in Yiddish.

== Notable students ==

Among Hutner&#x27;s notable students are first and foremost his only daughter Rebbetzin Dr. Bruria David (1938–2023) the founder of the Beth Jacob Jerusalem seminary for young Jewish women in Israel. Rabbis Yisroel Eliyah Weintraub, and Feivel Cohen, a noted Posek. Another was the author Shlomo Carlebach, who was appointed as the &quot;mashgiach ruchani&quot; at the Yeshiva Chaim Berlin, but who split with Hutner on policy matters in the 1970s. They were both Holocaust survivors whom Hutner took upon himself to raise as his own &quot;sons&quot; together with others in similar circumstances. Hutner also gave semikhah to Shlomo Carlebach, the musician, during the days that the latter was still with Lubavitch.

Other students included rabbis Yonasan David (his son-in-law) and Aharon Schechter, his successors as rosh yeshivas of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin; Aharon Lichtenstein, son-in-law of Joseph B. Soloveitchik and rosh yeshiva of Yeshivat Har Etzion in Israel; Rabbi Aharon Feldman, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel and a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah; Pinchas Stolper of the Orthodox Union and founder of NCSY who followed Hutner&#x27;s guidelines in setting up this youth outreach movement; Yaakov Feitman, prominent rabbi, past President of the Young Israel Council of Rabbis and disseminator of Hutner&#x27;s views; Shlomo Freifeld who set up one of the first full-time yeshivas for baal teshuva students in the world; Joshua Fishman, past leader and executive Vice President of Torah Umesorah the National Society for Hebrew Day Schools; Yaakov Perlow, the Novominsker Rebbe of Boro Park; Yitzhak_Aharon_Korff, the Zvhil-Mezbuz Rebbe of Boston and Jerusalem, and Noah Weinberg founder and head of Aish Hatorah as well as his brother Yaakov Weinberg of Ner Israel Yeshiva in Baltimore.

<text>Bomber destroyers were World War II interceptor aircraft intended to destroy enemy bomber aircraft. Bomber destroyers were typically larger and heavier than general interceptors, designed to mount more powerful armament, and often having twin engines. They differed from night fighters largely in that they were designed for day use.

The United States Army Air Corps considered powerfully armed destroyers, like the Bell YFM-1 Airacuda prototype, to counter a potential attack of high-performance bombers. The Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Bell P-39 Airacobra were also initially specified to carry very heavy armament based on a central 37 mm cannon, specified as interceptor aircraft working in the anti-bomber role.

In the pre-war era the UK, by contrast, favored development of the &quot;turret fighter&quot;, such as the Boulton Paul Defiant, which mounted the armament in a rotating turret. Turret fighters were expected to work together to coordinate fire on unescorted bombers (due to limits of German fighter range), able to attack from all quarters, and not be limited by the brief firing opportunity of a single seat fighter in a high speed attack. 

The P-38, a small, single-crewed example of the bomber destroyer type, was eventually outfitted with a 20 mm cannon and four .50-caliber machine guns in a central nacelle instead of a heavier cannon; it proved itself a highly competent fighter aircraft in the early phase of World War II. 

A deceptively similar, although completely different, designation was the German &quot;Zerstörer&quot; (meaning &quot;destroyer&quot;). Introduced on 1 May 1939, the term did specifically &quot;exclude&quot; the defensive anti-bomber role (leaving it for the light fighters), and envisaged a heavy fighter for offensive missions: escorting the bombers, long-range fighter suppression, and ground attack. The German designs suffered performance deficits as they were weighed down by a two- or three-man crew and extra cockpit accommodations.

After World War II, improvements in engine power and armament led to a loss of interest in building bomber destroyers as a specific class of aircraft. Even small fighters were able to carry enough firepower to deal effectively with enemy bombers, and high-performance all-purpose late-war fighters—the P-51 Mustang being the prime example—excelled at all fighter roles: pursuit, bomber escort, interception, and ground attack. The interest in interceptors was renewed during the Cold War; both the United States and the Soviet Union designed and produced dedicated &quot;pure&quot; interceptors such as the Convair F-106 Delta Dart and the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25. These aircraft were generally never referred to as &quot;bomber destroyers&quot;, even though their primary mission was the destruction of enemy strategic bombers. Few dedicated interceptors have been designed or produced since the 1960s.

<text>Optical communication, also known as optical telecommunication, is communication at a distance using light to carry information. It can be performed visually or by using electronic devices. The earliest basic forms of optical communication date back several millennia, while the earliest electrical device created to do so was the photophone, invented in 1880.

An optical communication system uses a transmitter, which encodes a message into an optical signal, a channel, which carries the signal to its destination, and a receiver, which reproduces the message from the received optical signal. When electronic equipment is not employed the &#x27;receiver&#x27; is a person visually observing and interpreting a signal, which may be either simple (such as the presence of a beacon fire) or complex (such as lights using color codes or flashed in a Morse code sequence).

Modern communication relies on optical networking systems using optical fiber, optical amplifiers, lasers, switches, routers, and other related technologies. Free-space optical communication use lasers to transmit signals in space, while terrestrial forms are naturally limited by geography and weather. This article provides a basic introduction to different forms of optical communication.

== Visual forms ==
Visual techniques such as smoke signals, beacon fires, hydraulic telegraphs, ship flags and semaphore lines were the earliest forms of optical communication. Hydraulic telegraph semaphores date back to the 4th century BCE Greece. Distress flares are still used by mariners in emergencies, while lighthouses and navigation lights are used to communicate navigation hazards.

The heliograph uses a mirror to reflect sunlight to a distant observer. When a signaler tilts the mirror to reflect sunlight, the distant observer sees flashes of light that can be used to transmit a prearranged signaling code. Naval ships often use signal lamps and Morse code in a similar way.

Aircraft pilots often use visual approach slope indicator (VASI) projected light systems to land safely, especially at night. Military aircraft landing on an aircraft carrier use a similar system to land correctly on a carrier deck. The coloured light system communicates the aircraft&#x27;s height relative to a standard landing glideslope. As well, airport control towers still use Aldis lamps to transmit instructions to aircraft whose radios have failed.

=== Semaphore line ===
A &#x27;semaphore telegraph&#x27;, also called a &#x27;semaphore line&#x27;, &#x27;optical telegraph&#x27;, &#x27;shutter telegraph chain&#x27;, &#x27;Chappe telegraph&#x27;, or &#x27;Napoleonic semaphore&#x27;, is a system used for conveying information by means of visual signals, using towers with pivoting arms or shutters, also known as blades or paddles. Information is encoded by the position of the mechanical elements; it is read when the shutter is in a fixed position.

Semaphore lines were a precursor of the electrical telegraph. They were far faster than post riders for conveying a message over long distances, but far more expensive and less private than the electrical telegraph lines which would later replace them. The maximum distance that a pair of semaphore telegraph stations can bridge is limited by geography, weather and the availability of light; thus, in practical use, most optical telegraphs used lines of relay stations to bridge longer distances. Each relay station would also require its complement of skilled operator-observers to convey messages back and forth across the line.

The modern design of semaphores was first foreseen by the British polymath Robert Hooke, who first gave a vivid and comprehensive outline of visual telegraphy in a 1684 submission to the Royal Society. His proposal (which was motivated by military concerns following the Battle of Vienna the preceding year) was not put into practice during his lifetime.

The first operational optical semaphore line arrived in 1792, created by the French engineer Claude Chappe and his brothers, who succeeded in covering France with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of . It was used for military and national communications until the 1850s.

Many national services adopted signaling systems different from the Chappe system. For example, Britain and Sweden adopted systems of shuttered panels (in contradiction to the Chappe brothers&#x27; contention that angled rods are more visible). In Spain, the engineer Agustín de Betancourt developed his own system which was adopted by that state. This system was considered by many experts in Europe better than Chappe&#x27;s, even in France.

These systems were popular in the late 18th to early 19th century but could not compete with the electrical telegraph, and went completely out of service by 1880.

=== Semaphore signal flags ===
Semaphore flags are the system for conveying information at a distance by means of visual signals with hand-held flags, rods, disks, paddles, or occasionally bare or gloved hands. Information is encoded by the position of the flags, objects or arms; it is read when they are in a fixed position.

Semaphores were adopted and widely used (with hand-held flags replacing the mechanical arms of shutter semaphores) in the maritime world in the 19th century. They are still used during underway replenishment at sea and are acceptable for emergency communication in daylight or, using lighted wands instead of flags, at night.

The newer flag semaphore system uses two short poles with square flags, which a signaler holds in different positions to convey letters of the alphabet and numbers. The transmitter holds one pole in each hand, and extends each arm in one of eight possible directions. Except for in the rest position, the flags cannot overlap. The flags are colored differently based on whether the signals are sent by sea or by land. At sea, the flags are colored red and yellow (the Oscar flags), while on land, they are white and blue (the Papa flags). Flags are not required, they just make the characters more obvious.

=== Signal lamps ===
Signal lamps (such as Aldis lamps), are visual signaling devices for optical communication (typically using Morse code). Modern signal lamps are a focused lamp which can produce a pulse of light. In large versions this pulse is achieved by opening and closing shutters mounted in front of the lamp, either via a manually operated pressure switch or, in later versions, automatically.

With hand held lamps, a concave mirror is tilted by a trigger to focus the light into pulses. The lamps are usually equipped with some form of optical sight, and are most commonly deployed on naval vessels and also used in airport control towers with coded aviation light signals.

Aviation light signals are used in the case of a radio failure, an aircraft not equipped with a radio, or in the case of a hearing-impaired pilot. Air traffic controllers have long used signal light guns to direct such aircraft. The light gun&#x27;s lamp has a focused bright beam capable of emitting three different colors: red, white and green. These colors may be flashing or steady, and provide different instructions to aircraft in flight or on the ground (for example, &quot;cleared to land&quot; or &quot;cleared for takeoff&quot;). Pilots can acknowledge the instructions by wiggling their plane&#x27;s wings, moving their ailerons if they are on the ground, or by flashing their landing or navigation lights during night time. Only 12 simple standardized instructions are directed at aircraft using signal light guns as the system is not utilized with Morse code.

=== Heliograph ===
A heliograph ( &quot;helios&quot;, meaning &quot;sun&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;write&quot;) is a wireless solar telegraph that signals by flashes of sunlight (generally using Morse code) reflected by a mirror. The flashes are produced by momentarily pivoting the mirror, or by interrupting the beam with a shutter.

The heliograph was a simple but effective instrument for instantaneous optical communication over long distances during the late 19th and early 20th century. Its main uses were in military, surveys and forest protection work. They were standard issue in the British and Australian armies until the 1960s, and were used by the Pakistani army as late as 1975.

==Electronic forms==
In the present day a variety of electronic systems optically transmit and receive information carried by pulses of light. Fiber-optic communication cables are employed to carry electronic data and telephone traffic. Free-space optical communications are also used every day in various applications.

=== Optical fiber ===

Optical fiber is the most common type of channel for optical communications. The transmitters in optical fiber links are generally light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or laser diodes. Infrared light is used more commonly than visible light, because optical fibers transmit infrared wavelengths with less attenuation and dispersion. The signal encoding is typically simple intensity modulation, although historically optical phase and frequency modulation have been demonstrated in the lab. The need for periodic signal regeneration was largely superseded by the introduction of the erbium-doped fiber amplifier, which extended link distances at significantly lower cost. The commercial introduction of dense wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in 1996 by Ciena Corp was the real start of optical networking. WDM is now the common basis nearly every high-capacity optical system in the world

The first optical communication systems were designed and delivered to the U.S. Army and Chevron by Optelecom, Inc., the venture co-founded by Gordon Gould, the inventor of the optical amplifier and the laser.

=== Photophone ===

The photophone (originally given an alternate name, radiophone) is a communication device which allowed for the transmission of speech on a beam of light. It was invented jointly by Alexander Graham Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter on February 19, 1880, at Bell&#x27;s 1325 &#x27;L&#x27; Street laboratory in Washington, D.C. Both were later to become full associates in the Volta Laboratory Association, created and financed by Bell.

On June 21, 1880, Bell&#x27;s assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message of considerable distance, from the roof of the Franklin School to the window of Bell&#x27;s laboratory, some 213 meters (about 700 ft) away.

Bell believed the photophone was his most important invention. Of the 18 patents granted in Bell&#x27;s name alone, and the 12 he shared with his collaborators, four were for the photophone, which Bell referred to as his &quot;greatest achievement&quot;, telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was &quot;the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone&quot;.

The photophone was a precursor to the fiber-optic communication systems which achieved popular worldwide usage starting in the 1980s. The master patent for the photophone ( &quot;Apparatus for Signalling and Communicating, called Photophone&quot;), was issued in December 1880, many decades before its principles came to have practical applications.

=== Free-space optical communication ===

Free-space optics (FSO) systems are employed for &#x27;last mile&#x27; telecommunications and can function over distances of several kilometers as long as there is a clear line of sight between the source and the destination, and the optical receiver can reliably decode the transmitted information. Other free-space systems can provide high-data-rate, long-range links using small, low-mass, low-power-consumption subsystems which make them suitable for communications in space. Various planned satellite constellations intended to provide global broadband coverage take advantage of these benefits and employ laser communication for inter-satellite links between the several hundred to thousand satellites effectively creating a space-based optical mesh network.

More generally, transmission of unguided optical signals is known as optical wireless communications (OWC). Examples include medium-range visible light communication and short-distance IrDA, using infrared LEDs.

<text>A free-net was originally a computer system or network that provided public access to digital resources and community information, including personal communications, through modem dialup via the public switched telephone network. The concept originated in the health sciences to provide online help for medical patients. With the development of the Internet free-net systems became the first to offer limited Internet access to the general public to support the non-profit community work. The Cleveland Free-Net (&quot;cleveland.freenet.edu&quot;), founded in 1986, was the pioneering community network of this kind in the world.

Any person with a personal computer, or through access from public terminal in libraries, could register for accounts on a free-net, and was assigned an email address. Other services often included Usenet newsgroups, chat rooms, IRC, telnet, and archives of community information, delivered either with text-based Gopher software or later the World-Wide Web. 

The word mark Free-Net was a registered trademark of the National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN), founded in 1989 by Tom Grundner at Case Western Reserve University. NPTN was a non-profit organization dedicated to establishing and developing, free, public access, digital information and communication services for the general public. It closed operations in 1996, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However, prior use of the term created some conflicts. NPTN distributed the software package &quot;FreePort&quot;, developed at Case Western Reserve, that was used and licensed by many of the free-net sites.

The Internet domain name &quot;freenet.org&quot; was first registered by the Greater Detroit Free-Net (detroit.freenet.org), a non-profit community system in Detroit, MI, and a member of the NPTN. The Greater Detroit Free-Net provided other subdomains to several free-net systems during its operation from 1993 to approximately 2001.

Unlike commercial Internet service providers, free-nets originally provided direct terminal-based dialup, instead of other networked connections, such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). The development of Internet access with cheaper and faster connections, and the advent of the World-Wide Web made the original free-net community concept obsolete.

A number of free-nets, including the original Cleveland Free-Net, have shut down or changed their focus. Free-nets have always been locally governed, so interpretation of their mission to remove barriers to access and provide a forum for community information, as well as services offered, can vary widely. As text-based Internet became less popular, some of the original free-nets have made available PPP dialup and more recently DSL services, as a revenue generating mechanism, with some now transitioning into the community wireless movement.

Several free-net systems continue under new mission statements. Rochester Free-Net (Rochester, New York), for instance, focuses on hosting community service organizations (over 500 to date) as well as seminars about Internet use to the community at no charge. Austin FreeNet (Austin, Texas) now provides technology training and access to residents of the city, &quot;fostering skills that enable people to succeed in a digital age.&quot;

<doc id="164181" wikidata="Q962155" url="?curid=164181" title="J. A. Hobson">
<text>John Atkinson Hobson (6 July 1858 – 1 April 1940) was an English economist and social scientist. Hobson is best known for his writing on imperialism, which influenced Vladimir Lenin, and his theory of underconsumption.

His principal and earliest contribution to economics was the theory of underconsumption, a scathing criticism of Say&#x27;s law and classical economics&#x27; emphasis on thrift. However, this discredited Hobson among the professional economics community from which he was ultimately excluded. Other early work critiqued the classical theory of rent and anticipated the Neoclassical &quot;marginal productivity&quot; theory of distribution.

After covering the Second Boer War as a correspondent for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, he condemned British involvement in the war and characterised it as acting under the influence of mine owners. In a series of books, he explored the associations between imperialism and international conflict and asserted that imperial expansion is driven by a search for new markets and investment opportunities overseas. 

Later, he argued that maldistribution of income resulted, through oversaving and underconsumption, in unemployment and that the remedy was in eradicating the &quot;surplus&quot; by the redistribution of income by taxation and the nationalization of monopolies. He opposed the First World War and advocated the formation of a world political body to prevent wars. Following the war, he became a reformist socialist.

==Life==
===Early life===
Hobson was born in Derby in Derbyshire, the son of William Hobson, &quot;a rather prosperous newspaper proprietor&quot;, and Josephine Atkinson. He was the brother of the mathematician Ernest William Hobson.

===Early career===
When Hobson relocated to London in 1887, England was in the midst of a major economic depression. While classical economics was at a loss to explain the vicious business cycles, London had many societies that proposed alternatives. While living in London, Hobson was exposed to the Social Democrats and H.M. Hyndman, Christian Socialists, and Henry George&#x27;s Single-tax system. He befriended several of the prominent Fabians who would found the London School of Economics, some of whom he had known at Oxford. However, none of these groups proved persuasive enough for Hobson; rather it was his collaboration with a friend, the businessman and mountain climber Albert F. Mummery, that would produce Hobson&#x27;s contribution to economics: the theory of underconsumption. First described by Mummery and Hobson in the book &quot;Physiology of Industry&quot; (1889), underconsumption was a scathing criticism of Say&#x27;s law and classical economics&#x27; emphasis on thrift. The forwardness of the book&#x27;s conclusions discredited Hobson among the professional economics community. Ultimately he was excluded from the academic community.

During the very late 19th century, his works included &quot;Problems of Poverty&quot; (1891), &quot;Evolution of Modern Capitalism &quot;(1894), &quot;Problem of the Unemployed&quot; (1896) and &quot;John Ruskin: Social Reformer&quot; (1898). They developed Hobson&#x27;s critique of the classical theory of rent and his proposed generalization anticipated the Neoclassical &quot;marginal productivity&quot; theory of distribution.

===Boer War and imperialism===
Soon after this period Hobson was recruited by the editor of the newspaper &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; to be their South African correspondent. During his coverage of the Second Boer War, Hobson began to form the idea that imperialism was the direct result of the expanding forces of modern capitalism. He believed the mine owners, led by Cecil Rhodes, wanted control of the Transvaal. Accordingly, he believed they manipulated the British into fighting the Boers so that they could maximize their profits from mining. His return to England was marked by his strong condemnation of the conflict.

His publications during the next few years demonstrated an exploration of the associations between imperialism and international conflict. These works included &quot;War in South Africa&quot; (1900) and &quot;Psychology of Jingoism&quot; (1901). In what is arguably his magnum opus, &quot;Imperialism&quot; (1902), he espoused the opinion that imperial expansion is driven by a search for new markets and investment opportunities overseas. &quot;Imperialism&quot; gained Hobson an international reputation, and influenced such notable thinkers as Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, and Hannah Arendt&#x27;s &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951).

In a 1902 &quot;Political Science Quarterly&quot; article, Hobson challenged numerous moral justifications for imperialism, including the notion that &quot;less efficient&quot; races benefitted from subordination to &quot;more efficient&quot; races.

Hobson wrote for several other journals before writing his next major work, &quot;The Industrial System&quot; (1909). In this tract he argued that maldistribution of income resulted, through oversaving and underconsumption, in unemployment and that the remedy was in eradicating the &quot;surplus&quot; by the redistribution of income by taxation and the nationalization of monopolies.

===First World War and later career===
Hobson&#x27;s opposition to the First World War caused him to join the Union of Democratic Control. His advocacy for the formation of a world political body to prevent wars can be found in his piece &quot;Towards International Government&quot; (1914). However, he became staunchly opposed to the League of Nations.

In 1919, Hobson joined the Independent Labour Party. This was soon followed by writings for socialist publications such as the &quot;New Leader&quot;, the &quot;Socialist Review&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. During this period it became clear that Hobson favoured capitalist reformation over communist revolution. He was critical of the Labour Government elected in 1929.

Hobson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Confessions of an Economic Heretic&quot; was published in 1938.

==Commentary on Hobson==
===Critical appraisal===
R. H. Tawney wrote the following in &quot;&quot; (1920):
The greater part of modern property has been attenuated to a pecuniary lien or bond on the product of industry which carries with it a right to payment, but which is normally valued precisely because it relieves the owner from any obligation to perform a positive or constructive function. Such property may be called passive property, or property for acquisition, for exploitation, or for power... It is questionable, however, whether economists shall call it &quot;Property&quot; at all, and not rather, as Mr. Hobson has suggested, &quot;Improperty,&quot; since it is not identical with the rights which secure the owner the produce of his toil, but is opposite of them.
V.I. Lenin, in &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot; (1916)—which was probably his most influential work on later Marxian scholarship—made use of Hobson&#x27;s &quot;Imperialism&quot; extensively, remarking in the preface &quot;I made use of the principal English work, &quot;Imperialism&quot;, J. A. Hobson&#x27;s book, with all the care that, in my opinion, that work deserves.&quot; In the work itself—despite disagreeing with Hobson&#x27;s liberal politics—Lenin repeatedly cites Hobson&#x27;s interpretation of imperialism approvingly; for example:
We see that Kautsky, while claiming that he continues to advocate Marxism, as a matter of fact takes a step backward compared with the social-liberal Hobson, who more correctly takes into account two &quot;historically concrete&quot; ... features of modern imperialism: (1) the competition between several imperialisms, and (2) the predominance of the financier over the merchant.
Historians Peter Duignan and Lewis H. Gann argue that Hobson had an enormous influence in the early 20th century among people all around the world:
Hobson&#x27;s ideas were not entirely original; however his hatred of moneyed men and monopolies, his loathing of secret compacts and public bluster, fused all existing indictments of imperialism into one coherent system...His ideas influenced German nationalist opponents of the British Empire as well as French Anglophobes and Marxists; they colored the thoughts of American liberals and isolationist critics of colonialism. In days to come they were to contribute to American distrust of Western Europe and of the British Empire. Hobson helped make the British averse to the exercise of colonial rule; he provided indigenous nationalists in Asia and Africa with the ammunition to resist rule from Europe.
Later historians attacked Hobson and the Marxist theories of imperialism he influenced. Notably, John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson in their 1953 article &quot;The Imperialism of Free Trade&quot; argued that Hobson placed too much emphasis on the role of formal empire and directly ruled colonial possessions, not taking into account the significance of trading power, political influence and informal imperialism. They also argued that the difference in British foreign policy that Hobson observed between the mid-19th-century indifference to empire that accompanied free market economics, and the later intense imperialism after 1870, was not real.

Hobson believed &quot;colonial primitive peoples&quot; were inferior. In &quot;Imperialism&quot; he advocated their &quot;gradual elimination&quot; by an international organization: &quot;A rational stirpiculture in the wide social interest might, however, require a repression of the spread of degenerate or unprogressive races&quot;. Such a plan should be implemented, according to Hobson, following approval by an &quot;international political organization&quot;. While it can be said the 1902 work reflected the Social Darwinism trend of the time, Hobson left this section mainly unchanged when he published the third edition in 1938.

===Antisemitism===
Hobson&#x27;s early works were critical of the impact of Jewish immigration and Jewish financiers. In the 1890s he argued that large scale Jewish immigration from the Russian Partition to Western Europe harmed the interests of native workers and advocated limitations on immigration. Writing on the South African war in &quot;War in South Africa&quot; (1900), he linked the impetus towards war to &quot;Jew Power&quot; in South Africa and saw Johannesburg as a &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;. Hobson wrote that &quot;Jewish financiers&quot;, whom he saw as &quot;parasites&quot;, manipulated the British government that danced to their &quot;diabolical tune&quot;. According to history professor Norman Etherington, the section on financiers in &quot;Imperialism&quot; seems irrelevant to Hobson&#x27;s economic discourse, and was probably included since Hobson truly believed it. Hobson was innovative in tying between 1898 and 1902 the concept of modernity, empire, and Jews together; according to Hobson, the international financiers influenced the government partially through Jewish press ownership in South Africa and London.

Hobson&#x27;s analysis was widely disseminated by those opposed to the war and received significant attention. Other contemporary anti-war writers also alleged a mainly Jewish &quot;capitalist conspiracy&quot; was taking place. Following Hobson&#x27;s January 1900 article &quot;Capitalism and Imperialism in South Africa&quot;, Labour leader Keir Hardie in February 1900 repeated the same message in paraphrased form accusing &quot;half a dozen financial houses, many of them Jewish&quot; of leading the UK to war. However, as the British working class tended to support the war in South Africa, Hobson&#x27;s zeal in attacking &quot;Jew Power&quot; in South Africa and manipulation by a secret &quot;racial confederacy&quot; failed to attract popular support in Britain, though &quot;anti-Alien&quot; sentiments continued to be an issue. Among commentators in Continental Europe, in particular France and Germany, the alleged &quot;robbery committed by international Jewry&quot; was frequently linked by right-wing antisemites to &quot;British imperialist piracy&quot; during the Second Boer War.

<doc id="164185" wikidata="Q994929" url="?curid=164185" title="Brutus of Troy">
<text>Brutus, also called Brute of Troy, is a mythical British king. He is described as a legendary descendant of the Trojan hero Aeneas, known in medieval British legend as the eponymous founder and first king of Britain. This legend first appears in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, an anonymous 9th-century historical compilation to which commentary was added by Nennius, but is best known from the account given by the 12th-century chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth in his .

==&quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;==
Some have suggested that attributing the origin of &#x27;Britain&#x27; to the Latin &#x27;Brutus&#x27; may be ultimately derived from Isidore of Seville&#x27;s popular 7th-century work &quot;Etymologiae&quot; (c. 560–636), in which it was speculated that the name of Britain comes from &quot;bruti&quot;, on the basis that the Britons were, in the eyes of that author, brutes, or savages. A more detailed story, set before the foundation of Rome, follows, in which Brutus is the grandson or great grandson of Aeneas – a legend that was perhaps inspired by Isidore&#x27;s spurious etymology and blends it with the Christian, pseudo-historical, &quot;Frankish Table of Nations&quot; tradition that emerged in the early medieval European scholarly world (actually of 6th-century AD Byzantine origin, and not Frankish, according to historian Walter Goffart) and attempted to trace the peoples of the known world (as well as legendary figures, such as the Trojan house of Aeneas) back to biblical ancestors.

Supposedly following Roman sources such as Livy and Virgil, the &quot;Historia&quot; tells how Aeneas settled in Italy after the Trojan War, and how his son Ascanius founded Alba Longa, one of the precursors of Rome. Ascanius married, and his wife became pregnant. In a variant version, the father is Silvius, who is identified as either the second son of Aeneas, previously mentioned in the &quot;Historia&quot;, or as the son of Ascanius. A magician, asked to predict the child&#x27;s future, said it would be a boy and that he would be the bravest and most beloved in Italy. Enraged, Ascanius had the magician put to death. The mother died in childbirth.

The boy, named Brutus, later accidentally killed his father with an arrow and was banished from Italy. After wandering among the islands of the Tyrrhenian Sea and through Gaul, where he founded the city of Tours, Brutus eventually came to Britain, named it after himself, and filled it with his descendants. His reign is synchronised to the time the High Priest Eli was judge in Israel, and when the Ark of the Covenant was taken by the Philistines.

A variant version of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; makes Brutus the son of Ascanius&#x27;s son Silvius, and traces his genealogy back to Ham, son of Noah. Another chapter traces Brutus&#x27;s genealogy differently, making him the great-grandson of the legendary Roman king Numa Pompilius, who was himself a son of Ascanius, and tracing his descent from Noah&#x27;s son Japheth. These Christianising traditions conflict with the classical Trojan genealogies, relating the Trojan royal family to Greek gods.

Yet another Brutus, son of Hisicion, son of Alanus the first European, also traced back across many generations to Japheth, is referred to in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. This Brutus&#x27;s brothers were Francus, Alamanus and Romanus, also ancestors of significant European nations.

==&quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;==
Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s account tells much the same story, but in greater detail. In this version, Brutus is explicitly the grandson, rather than son, of Ascanius; his father is Ascanius&#x27; son Silvius. The magician who predicts great things for the unborn Brutus also foretells he will kill both his parents. He does so, in the same manner described in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, and is banished. Travelling to Greece, he discovers a group of Trojans enslaved there. He becomes their leader, and after a series of battles they defeat the Greek king Pandrasus by attacking his camp at night after capturing the guards. He takes him hostage and forces him to let his people go. He is given Pandrasus&#x27;s daughter Ignoge or Innogen in marriage, and ships and provisions for the voyage, and sets sail.

The Trojans land on a deserted island and discover an abandoned temple to Diana. After performing the appropriate ritual, Brutus falls asleep in front of the goddess&#x27;s statue and is given a vision of the land where he is destined to settle, an island in the western ocean inhabited only by a few giants.

After some adventures in north Africa and a close encounter with the Sirens, Brutus discovers another group of exiled Trojans living on the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea, led by the prodigious warrior Corineus. In Gaul, Corineus provokes a war with Goffarius Pictus, king of Aquitaine, after hunting in the king&#x27;s forests without permission. Brutus&#x27;s nephew Turonus dies in the fighting, and the city of Tours is founded where he is buried. The Trojans win most of their battles but are conscious that the Gauls have the advantage of numbers, so go back to their ships and sail for Britain, then called Albion. They land on &quot;&quot;—&quot;the sea-coast of Totnes&quot;. They meet the giant descendants of Alebion and defeat them.

Brutus renames the island after himself and becomes its first king. Corineus becomes ruler of Cornwall, which is named after him. They are harassed by the giants during a festival, but kill all of them but their leader, the largest giant Goemagot, who is saved for a wrestling match against Corineus. Corineus throws him over a cliff to his death. Brutus then founds a city on the banks of the River Thames, which he calls Troia Nova, or New Troy. The name is in time corrupted to Trinovantum, and the city is later called London. He creates laws for his people and rules for twenty-four years. After his death he is buried in Trinovantum, and the island is divided between his three sons: Locrinus (England), Albanactus (Scotland) and Kamber (Wales).

==Legacy==

Early translations and adaptations of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, such as Wace&#x27;s Norman French &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;, Layamon&#x27;s Middle English &quot;Brut&quot;, were named after Brutus, and the word &quot;brut&quot; came to mean a chronicle of British history. 
One of several Middle Welsh adaptations was called the &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the Kings&quot;). &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the Princes&quot;), a major chronicle for the Welsh rulers from the 7th century to loss of independence, is a purely historical work containing no legendary material but the title reflects the influence of Geoffrey&#x27;s work and, in one sense, can be seen as a &quot;sequel&quot; to it.

Early chroniclers of Britain, such as Alfred of Beverley, Nicholas Trivet and Giraldus Cambrensis began their histories of Britain with Brutus. The foundation myth of Brutus having settled in Britain was still considered as genuine history during the Early Modern Period, for example &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; (1577) considers the Brutus myth to be factual. It was not until the twentieth century that archaeologists were able to prove conclusively that London was founded in 43 AD.

The 18th-century English poet Hildebrand Jacob wrote an epic poem, &quot;Brutus the Trojan, Founder of the British Empire&quot;, about him, following in the tradition of Virgil&#x27;s fictitious Roman foundation epic the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, left unfinished at Virgil&#x27;s death in 19 BC. 

Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; says that Brutus and his followers landed at Totnes in Devon. A stone on Fore Street in Totnes, known as the &quot;Brutus Stone&quot;, commemorates this imaginary event.

In 2021, the Totnes community radio station Soundart Radio commissioned a radio drama adaptation of the Brutus myth by the writer Will Kemp.

<doc id="164186" wikidata="Q508474" url="?curid=164186" title="Nestor (genus)">
<text>The genus Nestor is one of the two extant genera of the parrot family Strigopidae. Together with the kākāpō, and the extinct parrots in the genus &quot;Nelepsittacus&quot;, they form the parrot superfamily Strigopoidea. The &quot;Nestor&#x27;s&quot; genus contains two extant parrot species from New Zealand and two extinct species from Norfolk Island, Australia and Chatham Island, New Zealand, respectively. All species are large stocky birds with short squarish tails. A defining characteristic of the genus is the tongue, which is tipped with a hair-like fringe. The superficial resemblance of this tongue to that of lorikeets has led some taxonomists to consider the two groups closely related, but DNA evidence shows they are not.

==Classification==
All four species in the genus &quot;Nestor&quot; are thought to stem from a &#x27;proto-kaka&#x27;, dwelling in the forests of New Zealand 5 million years ago. The closest living relative of the genus is the kākāpō (&quot;Strigops habroptilus&quot;). Together, they form the Strigopoidea, an ancient group that split off from all other Psittaciformes before their radiation.

In 2012 Leo Joseph and collaborators proposed that the genus &quot;Nestor&quot; should be placed in its own family, Nestoridae. This proposal has not been adopted in lists of the world birds and instead &quot;Nestor&quot; is placed with the genus &quot;Strigops&quot; in the family Strigopidae.

==Species==
There are two surviving species and at least one well documented extinct species in the genus &quot;Nestor&quot;. Very little is known about the fourth, the Chatham kākā, which may have been conspecific with another kaka species.

* Kea, &quot;Nestor notabilis&quot;
* Kākā, &quot;Nestor meridionalis&quot;
** North Island kākā, &quot;Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis&quot;
** South Island kākā, &quot;Nestor meridionalis meridionalis&quot;
* †Norfolk kākā, &quot;Nestor productus&quot; (extinct)
* †Chatham kākā, &quot;Nestor chathamensis&quot; (extinct)

==Status==

Of the four species, the Norfolk kaka and Chatham kaka became extinct in recent history. The last known individual of the Norfolk kaka died in captivity in London sometime after 1851, and only between seven and 20 skins survive. The Chatham kaka became extinct in pre-European times, after Polynesians arrived at the island, between 1550 and 1700, and is only known from subfossil bones. The mainland kaka is listed as endangered, and the kea is listed as vulnerable.

<doc id="164187" wikidata="Q7362969" url="?curid=164187" title="Rome Emperors">
<text>The Rome Emperors are a Minor League Baseball team of the South Atlantic League and the High-A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves. They are located in Rome, Georgia, and play their home games at AdventHealth Stadium. From 2003 to 2023, the team was known as the Rome Braves. They served as Atlanta&#x27;s Class A affiliate before being elevated to High-A with the restructuring of the minor league system in 2021.

==History==

===Organization&#x27;s historical beginnings===
A longstanding member of the current iteration South Atlantic League since its inception, the Class A Atlanta Braves affiliate&#x27;s history dates back to 1968 with the founding of the Greenwood Braves, sporting a roster featuring future major league talents such as Brett Butler, Steve Bedrosian, and Brian Snitker. Dale Murphy, Earl Williams and Rafeal Ramirez. The team was part of the Western Carolina&#x27;s League from 1968 to 1979 winning three league titles before being moved to Anderson, SC The Anderson team received a great deal of support and experienced relatively high attendance figures during its short run. Despite the local support though, former Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner moved the team to Sumter, South Carolina, after the 1984 season to establish the Sumter Braves. Sumter was a starting point for several major league talents, including an early stop for future Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Glavine. Sumter enjoyed the team for 6 seasons from 1985 to 1990. Notably for both Anderson and Sumter, their best finishes while in both locations came in seasons managed by current Atlanta manager Brian Snitker, who brought the Anderson team to a 72–70 5th-place finish in 1982, and a 77–60 3rd-place finish for Sumter in 1986. In Sumter, the team also earned their first opportunity in the SAL Playoffs as the First Half Champion of the 1985 North Division, going on to lose to the Greensboro Hornets in 2 games.

===The Macon Braves===
In 1991, the low league Braves saw themselves on the move once more when they transplanted the team to Macon, Georgia, thus becoming the Macon Braves. Macon had a very long history with minor league baseball before their time with the Braves, with the earliest assumed records dating back to 1885 with some nameless forms before their predominant history as the Macon Peaches in the original iteration of the South Atlantic League, which is still active today as the AA Southern League. The Braves brought baseball back to Macon following a three-season gap with the departure of the Pirates affiliate in 1987. As the Macon Braves, the team saw marginal success, earning a playoff bid in their inaugural 1991 season (2–0 series loss to the Columbia Mets), mid or lower pack of the SAL South Division from 1992 to 1996, a 1997 South Division Championship in 1997 which saw them win their first-ever Playoff series with a 2–1 win over the Augusta GreenJackets before falling to the Greensboro Bats 2–0 in the following round, subsequent Playoff runs in 1998 (2–0 series loss to Augusta) and 1999 (2–0 series loss to the Hickory Crawdads), and mid pack success in their final three seasons in Macon. In total, the team racked up an 850–820 record during their Macon years, with notable alumni such as Al Lopez, John Smoltz, Chipper Jones, and Andruw Jones. The Macon Braves would serve as the last time the city would host a major-league affiliated minor league team.

===Moving to Rome===

Following failed attempts to get the city of Macon to build a new ballpark for the team, as their home at Luther Williams Field was beginning to show its age and with the team still wanting over $1 million in renovations, the end of the 2002 season saw Atlanta decide again to move the franchise. Following the approval of a SPLOST tax, the city of Rome, Georgia, managed to entice the Braves organization, and as a result they became the new home of the Single-A affiliate starting with the 2003 season. The SPLOST tax helped with entirely building their home, AdventHealth Stadium, and a high level of optimism followed the team to Rome.

===2003 Inaugural season and championship===
Rocket Wheeler would be named the manager for the first season in Rome, and the start of his tenure in the Braves organization after previously serving the past three seasons as the manager for the AA then-Toronto Blue Jays affiliate Tennessee Smokies. During their inaugural season in Rome, the team started the first half of the 2003 South Atlantic League season with a 36–33 record, finishing foutth in the Southern Division and well outside the playoff spot won by Hickory. The second half featured a much better effort, with help from two future Braves fan-favorites in Brian McCann and Jeff Francoeur, and Rome got to a 42–38 record to win the Southern Division in the second half of the season and advance to the Playoffs for the time ever in Rome, and the sixth time overall since the original inception of the team in Anderson in 1980. Not only was it a historic first season in Rome by just making it to the playoffs, but the Rome Braves followed this with 2–1 series win over Hickory to advance to their first-ever South Atlantic League Championship, where they met the Lake County Captains. The series went to four games, and in their inaugural season, the Rome Braves won the 2003 South Atlantic League with a 3–1 series win over Lake County.

===Beginning of Ingle era===
After their first team championship in 2003, the following two seasons under Rocket Wheeler saw the team finish with a 70–70 record in 2004, and a 72–65 record in 2005, though neither were able to replicate the similar success of either a Championship or even a divisional crown. Rome went for a managerial change for the 2006 season, calling on Randy Ingle. Ingle served in the Braves organization for his entire 14 seasons prior to joining Rome, including two stops in 1993 and 2001 with Macon. He was also coming off of 4 years as the manager for the then Advanced-A affiliate Myrtle Beach Pelicans. Under Ingle, the 2006 Rome Braves won the 1st half South Division title with a 42–28 record to secure their first playoff trip since the Championship 2003 season, and finished the season with a 71–68 record and a 2–0 series loss to Augusta in the postseason. 2007–2010 saw the Rome Braves unable to climb out of the lower part of the South Division, finishing with losing records in all 4 seasons. Ingle would leave the team for the 2011 season, being sent down to manage the rookie league Danville Braves, however Ingle would return to Rome in 2012, as Rome finished the 2011 season with a 60–80 season and two different managers during the season with Matt Walbeck fired midseason by the organization after compiling a 25–45 bottom of the division record which was one of the worst in the minor leagues, and Walbeck being replaced by Rick Albert who led the team to a 35–35 finish. Ingle&#x27;s 2012 return started off much poorer than the 2011 Rome start, with Rome compiling an 18–52 record in the 1st half. The 2nd half of the season fared much better for Rome, going 44–24 and securing their first divisional crown in 6 seasons, even despite the overall season finish of 62–72 which would be worst in the Southern Division. The Braves would lose to the eventual 2012 Champion Asheville Tourists 2 games to 1 in their playoff series.

===Leadup to 2016 championship===
Ingle would serve another season with Rome in 2013, finishing just shy of a 2nd straight trip to the SAL Playoffs during the 2nd half of the season, and finishing with a 73–66 overall record. Jon Schuerholz would take over the team in 2014, swapping managerial duties with Ingle who would return to Danville for 2014. Rome would finish 2014 with a 56–84 record, their 3rd time in the last 5 seasons that the Braves would finish at the bottom of the South Division in overall record. Ingle again returned to the team in 2015, producing a just as disappointing 58–82 record with Rome unable to escape the bottom of the division once again. Sporting one of the youngest clubs in full-season baseball, 2016 looked to be starting the same way under Ingle, with a 27–42 having them at 6th in the division heading into the midseason break. Things got much better though in what would turn out to be another historic season for Rome. Thanks to a pitching room featuring Mike Soroka, Kolby Allard, Max Fried, A. J. Minter, and Touki Toussaint, and two big time bats in the form of Ronald Acuña Jr. and Austin Riley, players that majorly make up most of the current major league roster for Atlanta gave Rome one of its biggest pushes and went on to finish the 2nd half with a 43–27 record, once again returning to the playoffs. From there, it was indeed history as the R-Braves would get a 2–1 series win over the division powerhouse Charleston RiverDogs in the semifinals, and then go on to capture their 2nd South Atlantic League title with a 3–1 series victory over the Lakewood BlueClaws.

===Ingle&#x27;s retirement, Rocket&#x27;s return, start of Tuiasosopo era===
Following their second championship season, Ingle would serve one last year as manager for the Rome Braves in 2017, end with his best overall record finish during his time in Rome at 74–65, but unfortunately coming up short of a return to postseason play. 2018 saw Rome return to their past by bringing back Rocket Wheeler, their manager from the 2003 Championship season and the two seasons following. Wheeler had spent his time since leaving Rome in the Braves organization, taking over the Pelicans for 5 seasons following his original departure, getting 1 season as the manager for the AA Mississippi Braves, and 4 seasons on the rookie level before managing the Braves Advanced A ball for the Carolina Mudcats in 2016 and Florida Fire Frogs in 2017. Wheeler&#x27;s return in 2018 would show quick results with Rome finishing at the top of the South Division in the 1st half with a 40–29 record, though a slight slump in the 2nd half gave them a 31–36 record and 71–65 overall on the season. Rome would be eliminated in the playoffs by the 2nd half division champion, and eventual SAL Champion, Lexington Legends in a 2–0 series loss. For 2019 and into the modern day, Matt Tuiasosopo would be named the Rome Braves manager, and he would lead Rome to a 65–74 overall record while missing the playoffs.

===2020 Season cancellation and High-A promotion===
Like the entirety of the MiLB, the 2020 season was postponed and later cancelled for Rome following the COVID-19 pandemic. This also came following an off-season of rumors regarding the complete reorganization of the minor leagues, which would come into fruition following the cancellation of the 2020 season. On December 9, 2020, many of the major league clubs announced their new affiliations, totaling at 120 with each team sporting a Low-A, High-A, AA, and AAA team for 2021 and beyond. Rome was invited, and subsequently accepted said invite, back into the Braves organization as the new High-A affiliate, ending their run since the team&#x27;s inception as the Low-A affiliate and replacing the Fire Frogs in their new spot. Their fellow South Atlantic League team, the Augusta GreenJackets, would be named the new Low-A affiliate, while the Mississippi Braves and Gwinnett Stripers would retain their status as AA and AAA affiliates for the Braves respectively.

As part of the announcement on February 12, 2021, announcement of the new Professional Development League alignment, Rome accepted their invitation as the High-A affiliate, and signed a new contract with the organization to continue their tenure together through the 2030 season. The announcement also included Rome&#x27;s new league location, the newly created High-A East, with the Rome Braves joining former South Atlantic League opponents Asheville Tourists, Greensboro Grasshoppers, Greenville Drive, Hickory Crawdads, and Jersey Shore (formerly Lakewood) BlueClaws; alongside new opponents Aberdeen IronBirds, Brooklyn Cyclones, Hudson Valley Renegades, Wilmington Blue Rocks, Bowling Green Hot Rods, and Winston-Salem Dash. In 2022, the High-A East became known as the South Atlantic League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

===Emperors===
After the 20 years of donning the Braves tomahawk across the chest, the Rome Braves announced on August 11, 2023, that they would be dropping Braves&#x27; moniker in 2024. On November 16, 2023, the team was renamed the Rome Emperors, with a cap insignia and logo that featured an emperor penguin.

==Team mascot==

Prior to 2024, Rome had three mascots, Romey, Roxie, and introduced for the 2015 season, their &quot;son&quot; Roman. Romey was a tall (), blue, furry humanoid male mascot with yellow hair, while Roxie, who was added to the team after the 2005 season, was tall, humanoid, a lighter blue, and has a large yellow ponytail. Roman was also a furry blue humanoid male, his blue more matching that of Romey, with the added detail of his head being that of a baseball wearing a Roman soldier helmet.

Following Rome&#x27;s rebrand in 2024, the team introduced a new mascot, Julius. An emperor penguin, his name is an homage to the Roman leader Julius Caesar.

<doc id="164188" wikidata="Q956883" url="?curid=164188" title="Carnatic music">
<text>Carnatic music (known as or in the Dravidian languages) is a system of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and portions of east and south Telangana and southern Odisha.

It is one of three main subgenres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu texts and traditions, particularly the Samaveda. (The other two are Hindustani music and Odissi music.) The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in &quot;gāyaki&quot; (singing) style.

Although there are stylistic differences, the basic elements of (the relative musical pitch), (the musical sound of a single note), (the mode or melodic formulae), and (the rhythmic cycles) form the foundation of improvisation and composition in both Carnatic and Hindustani music. Although improvisation plays an important role, Carnatic music is mainly sung through compositions, especially the kriti (or kirtanam) – a form developed between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as Purandara Dasa, and the Trinity of Carnatic music. Carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions. Telugu language predominates in the evolution of Carnatic music. Most Carnatic compositions are in Telugu and Sanskrit.

Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer (usually a vocalist), a melodic accompaniment (usually a violin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a mridangam), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the performance. Other typical instruments used in performances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and chitraveena. The greatest concentration of Carnatic musicians is to be found in the city of Chennai. Various Carnatic music festivals are held throughout India and abroad, including the Madras Music Season, which has been considered to be one of the world&#x27;s largest cultural events.

==Etymology==
Carnatic music originated in Karnataka and was named after it, known as &quot;Karnāṭaka Saṁgīta&quot; which spread through Andhra and Tamil countries where it was sumptuously nourished.

==Origin and history==

Like all art forms in Indian culture, Indian classical music is believed to be a divine art form which originated from the devas and devis (Hindu gods and goddesses), and is venerated as symbolic of . Ancient treatises also describe the connection of the origin of the svaras, or notes, to the sounds of animals and birds and man&#x27;s effort to simulate these sounds through a keen sense of observation and perception. The &quot;Samaveda&quot;, which is believed to have laid the foundation for Indian classical music, consists of hymns from the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during Vedic yajnas. The &quot;Yajurveda&quot;, which mainly consists of sacrificial formulae, mentions the &quot;veena&quot; as an accompaniment to vocal recitations. References to Indian classical music are made in many ancient texts, including epics like the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The &quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot; states, &quot;vīṇāvādana tattvajñaḥ śrutijātiviśāradaḥ tālajñaścāprayāsena mokṣamārgaṃ niyacchati&quot; (&quot;The one who is well versed in &quot;veena&quot;, one who has the knowledge of srutis and one who is adept in tala, attains liberation (moksha) without doubt&quot;). Contemporray Carnatic music is based on musical concepts (including &quot;svara&quot;, &quot;raga&quot;, and &quot;tala&quot;) that were described in detail in several ancient works, particularly the Bharata&#x27;s &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; and &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; by Ilango Adigal.

Owing to Persian and Islamic influences in North India from the 12th century onwards, Indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct styles — Hindustani music and Carnatic music. Commentaries and other works, such as Sharngadeva&#x27;s &quot;Sangita Ratnakara&quot;, further elaborated on the musical concepts found in Indian classical music. By the 16th and 17th centuries, there was a clear demarcation between Carnatic and Hindustani music; Carnatic music remained relatively unaffected by Persian and Arabic influences. It was at this time that Carnatic music flourished in Vijayanagara, while the Vijayanagara Empire reached its greatest extent. Purandara Dasa, who is known as the &quot;father (&quot;pitamaha&quot;) of Carnatic music&quot;, formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of Carnatic music. Venkatamakhin invented and authored the formula for the melakarta system of raga classification in his Sanskrit work, the &quot;Chaturdandi Prakasika&quot; (1660 AD). Govindacharya is known for expanding the melakarta system into the sampurna raga scheme – the system that is in common use today.

By the 16th century, Indian classical music split into two styles: Hindustani in the North and Karnataka (later called Carnatic) in the South. The term &quot;Karnataka&quot; music originated from the Vijayanagara Empire, historically known as the Karnataka Empire. The British later influenced the change in name to &quot;Carnatic&quot; music, and the term is only about 150–200 years old.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Carnatic music was mainly patronised by the local kings of the Kingdom of Mysore, Kingdom of Travancore, and the Maratha rulers of Tanjore. Some of the royalty of the kingdoms of Mysore and Travancore were themselves noted composers and proficient in playing musical instruments, such as the veena, rudra veena, violin, ghatam, venu, mridangam, nadaswaram, and swarabat. Some famous court-musicians proficient in music were Veene Sheshanna (1852–1926) and Veene Subbanna (1861–1939), among others.

During the late 19th century, the city of Madras (now known as Chennai) emerged as the locus for Carnatic music. With the dissolution of the erstwhile princely states and the Indian independence movement reaching its conclusion in 1947, Carnatic music went through a radical shift in patronage into an art of the masses with ticketed performances organised by private institutions called sabhās.

=== Carnatic music outside of South India ===
From the 18th century, South Indian immigrant communities abroad increased, especially in Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka. Communities such as the Nattukottai Chettiars participate in the extension of the Carnatic cultural scene abroad, thanks to their rich patronage activity. Carnatic music artists therefore perform abroad among South Indian communities who request their coming, in order to enliven local community life. For a long time in Sri Lanka, Carnatic music was associated with Indian immigrants, and was often derogatorily referred to as &quot;&quot;thosai kade&quot; music&quot; (&quot;music from the dosa shop&quot;), in reference to the South Indians-owned restaurants and eateries that typically played this kind of music.

From the 20th century, Carnatic music gained significant popularity among certain social strata of the Sri Lankan population, who were then heavily influenced by a prominent cultural movement known as the Hindu revival. Carnatic music was thus appropriated and highly promoted during the 1920s and 1930s as a cultural and identity marker of the Colombo and Jaffna bourgeoisies, and by extension of the Sri Lankan Tamils. The place given to Carnatic music in the construction of a modern Sri Lankan Tamil identity has reached significant proportions, such as its rise in the curricula of most Jaffna colleges, where it gradually replaced from the mid-1930s the teaching of Western classical music, or its high esteem among the upper social classes of Colombo and Jaffna, where the learning of Carnatic music among young women is expected as a sign of good education. Many people have travelled to India for improving their skills, and the flow of students to India from Sri Lanka or of Sri Lankan Tamil origin is constantly increasing.

==Nature==
The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as &quot;gāyaki&quot;). Like Hindustani music, Carnatic music rests on two main elements: , the modes or melodic formulae, and , the rhythmic cycles.

Today, Carnatic music is presented by musicians in concerts or recordings, either vocally or through instruments. Carnatic music itself developed around musical works or compositions of phenomenal composers (see below).

==Important elements==

===Śruti===
&quot;Śruti&quot; commonly refers to musical pitch. It is the approximate equivalent of a tonic (or less precisely a key) in Western music; it is the note from which all the others are derived. It is also used in the sense of graded pitches in an octave. While there are an infinite number of sounds falling within a scale (or raga) in Carnatic music, the number that can be distinguished by auditory perception is twenty-two (although over the years, several of them have converged). In this sense, while sruti is determined by auditory perception, it is also an expression in the listener&#x27;s mind.

===Svara===
&quot;Svara&quot; refers to a type of musical sound that is a single note, which defines a relative (higher or lower) position of a note, rather than a defined frequency. &quot;Svara&quot;s also refer to the solfege of Carnatic music, which consist of seven notes, &quot;sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni&quot; (compare with the Hindustani &quot;sargam:&quot; sa-&quot;re&quot;-ga-ma-pa-&quot;dha&quot;-ni or Western do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti). These names are abbreviations of the longer names &quot;shadja&quot;, &quot;rishabha&quot;, &quot;gandhara&quot;, &quot;madhyama&quot;, &quot;panchama&quot;, &quot;dhaivata&quot; and &quot;nishada&quot;. Unlike other music systems, every member of the solfege (called a swara) has three variants. The exceptions are the drone notes, &quot;shadja&quot; and &quot;panchama&quot; (also known as the tonic and the dominant), which have only one form; and &quot;madhyama&quot; (the subdominant), which has two forms. A 7th century stone inscription in Kudumiyan Malai in Tamil Nadu shows vowel changes to solfege symbols with ra, ri, ru etc. to denote the higher quarter-tones. In one scale, or raga, there is usually only one variant of each note present. The exceptions exist in &quot;light&quot; ragas, in which, for artistic effect, there may be two, one ascending (in the &quot;arohanam&quot;) and another descending (in the &quot;avarohanam&quot;).

===Raga system===


A &quot;raga&quot; in Carnatic music prescribes a set of rules for building a melody – very similar to the Western concept of mode. It specifies rules for movements up (&quot;aarohanam&quot;) and down (&quot;avarohanam&quot;), the scale of which notes should figure more and which notes should be used more sparingly, which notes may be sung with &quot;gamaka&quot; (ornamentation), which phrases should be used or avoided, and so on. In effect, it is a series of obligatory musical events which must be observed, either absolutely or with a particular frequency.

In Carnatic music, the &quot;sampoorna ragas&quot; (those with all seven notes in their scales) are classified into a system called the &quot;melakarta&quot;, which groups them according to the kinds of notes that they have. There are seventy-two &quot;melakarta ragas&quot;, thirty six of whose madhyama (subdominant) is shuddha (perfect fourth from the tonic), the remaining thirty-six of whose madhyama (subdominant) is prati (an augmented fourth from the tonic). The &quot;ragas&quot; are grouped into sets of six, called &quot;chakras&quot; (&quot;wheels&quot;, though actually segments in the conventional representation) grouped according to the supertonic and mediant scale degrees. There is a system known as the &quot;katapayadi sankhya&quot; to determine the names of &quot;melakarta raga&quot;s.

&quot;Raga&quot;s may be divided into two classes: &quot;janaka raga&quot;s (i.e. melakarta or parent ragas) and &quot;janya raga&quot;s (descendant ragas of a particular janaka raga). Janya ragas are themselves subclassified into various categories.

===Tala system===

&quot;Tala&quot; refers to a fixed time cycle or metre, set for a particular composition, which is built from groupings of beats. &quot;Tala&quot;s have cycles of a defined number of beats and rarely change within a song. They have specific components, which in combinations can give rise to the variety to exist (over 108), allowing different compositions to have different rhythms.

Carnatic music singers usually keep the beat by moving their hands up and down in specified patterns, and using their fingers simultaneously to keep time. &quot;Tala&quot; is formed with three basic parts (called &quot;anga&quot;s) which are &quot;laghu&quot;, &quot;dhrtam&quot;, and &quot;anudhrtam&quot;, though complex talas may have other parts like &quot;plutam&quot;, &quot;guru&quot;, and &quot;kaakapaadam&quot;. There are seven basic &quot;tala&quot; groups which can be formed from the &quot;laghu&quot;, &quot;dhrtam&quot;, and &quot;anudhrtam&quot;:

* Ata tala
* Dhruva tala
* Eka tala
* Jhampa tala
* Matya tala
* Rupaka tala
* Triputa tala

A &quot;laghu&quot; has five variants (called &quot;jaathi&quot;s) based on the counting pattern. Five &quot;jaathis&quot; times seven tala groups gives thirty-five basic &quot;tala&quot;s, although use of other &quot;anga&quot;s results in a total of 108 &quot;tala&quot;s.

==Improvisation==
Improvisation in &quot;raga&quot; is an essential aspect of Indian classical music. &quot;&quot;Manodharma Sangeetam&quot; or &quot;kalpana Sangeetam&quot;&quot; (&quot;music of imagination&quot;) as it is known in Carnatic music, comprises several varieties of improvisation.

The main traditional forms of improvisation in Carnatic music are:

* Alapana 
* Niraval
* Pallavi
* Ragam 
* Swarakalpana
* Tanam
* Tani Avartanam

===Raga Alapana===

An alapana, sometimes also called ragam, is the exposition of a raga or tone – a slow improvisation with no rhythm, where the raga acts as the basis of embellishment. In performing alapana, performers consider each raga as an object that has beginnings and endings and consists somehow of sequences of thought.

The performer will explore the ragam and touch on its various nuances, singing in the lower octaves first, then gradually moving up to higher octaves, while giving a hint of the song to be performed.

Theoretically, this ought to be the easiest type of improvisation, since the rules are so few, but in fact, it takes much skill to sing a pleasing, comprehensive (in the sense of giving a &quot;feel for the ragam&quot;) and, most importantly, original raga alapana.

===Niraval===

Niraval, usually performed by the more advanced performers, consists of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly, but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations. Although niraval consists of extempore melodic variations, generally, the original patterns of duration are maintained; each word in the lines of text stay set within their original place (&quot;idam&quot;) in the tala cycle. The lines are then also played at different levels of speed which can include double speed, triple speed, quadruple speed and even sextuple speed. The improvised elaborations are made with a view of outlining the raga, the tempo, and the theme of the composition.

===Kalpanaswaram===

Kalpanaswaram, also known as swarakalpana, consists of improvising melodic and rhythmic passages using &quot;swaras&quot; (solfa syllables). Like niraval, kalpanaswaras are sung to end on a particular swara in the raga of the melody and at a specific place (&quot;idam&quot;) in the tala cycle.

Kalpanaswaras have a somewhat predictable rhythmical structure; the swaras are sung to end on the &quot;samam&quot; (the first beat of the rhythmical cycle). The swaras can also be sung at the same speed or double the speed of the melody that is being sung, though some artists sing triple-speed phrases too.

Kalpanaswaram is the most elementary type of improvisation, usually taught before any other form of improvisation.

===Tanam===
Tanam is one of the most important forms of improvisation, and is integral to Ragam Tanam Pallavi. Originally developed for the veena, it consists of expanding the raga with syllables like &quot;tha, nam, thom, aa, nom, na,&quot; etc.

===Ragam Tanam Pallavi===

Ragam, Tanam, and Pallavi are the principal long form in concerts, and is a composite form of improvisation. As the name suggests, it consists of raga alapana, tanam, and a pallavi line. Set to a slow-paced tala, the pallavi line is often composed by the performer. Through niraval, the performer manipulates the pallavi line in complex melodic and rhythmic ways. The niraval is followed by kalpanaswarams.

=== Tani Avartanam ===
Tani Avartanam refers to the extended solo that is played by the percussionists in a concert, and is usually played after the main composition in a concert. The percussionist displays the full range of his skills and rhythmic imagination during the solo, which may take from two to twenty minutes.

==Compositions==
In contrast to Hindustani music of the northern part of India, Carnatic music is taught and learned through compositions, which encode many intricate musical details, also providing scope for free improvisation. Nearly every rendition of a Carnatic music composition is different and unique as it embodies elements of the composer&#x27;s vision, as well as the musician&#x27;s interpretation.

A Carnatic composition really has two elements, one being the musical element, the other being what is conveyed in the composition. It is probably because of this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing. In addition to the rich musical experience, each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words are as important as the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.

There are many types/forms of compositions.

&quot;Geethams&quot; and &quot;swarajatis&quot; (which have their own peculiar composition structures) are principally meant to serve as basic learning exercises.

Compositions more commonly associated with Indian classical dance and Indian devotional music have also been increasingly used in the Carnatic music repertoire. The performance of the Sanskrit &quot;sloka&quot;, Tamil &quot;viruttam, Kannada Ugabhoga and&quot; Telugu &quot;padyamu&quot; or &quot;sisapadya&quot; forms are particularly unique. Though these forms consist of lyric-based verses, musicians improvise &quot;raga&quot; phrases in free rhythm, like an alapana, so both the sound value, and the meaning of the text, guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations. Forms such as the &quot;divya prabandham&quot;, &quot;thevaram&quot; and &quot;ugabhoga&quot; are often performed similarly, however, these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the &quot;devaranama&quot;, &quot;javali&quot;, &quot;padam&quot;, &quot;thillana&quot; and &quot;thiruppugazh&quot; forms.

The most common and significant forms in Carnatic music are the &quot;varnam&quot; and the &quot;kriti&quot; (or &quot;kirtanam&quot;).

===Varnam===
Varnams are short metric pieces which encapsulate the main features and requirements of a &quot;raga&quot;. The features and rules of the raga (also known as the &quot;sanchaaraas&quot; of a raga) include how each note of the raga should be stressed, the scale of the raga, and so on. All varnams consist of lyrics, as well as swara passages, including a &quot;pallavi&quot;, an &quot;anupallavi&quot;, &quot;muktayi swaras&quot;, a &quot;charanam&quot;, and &quot;chittaswaras&quot;.

Known for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music. Varnams are practised as vocal exercises in multiple speeds by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. In Carnatic music concerts, varnams are often performed by musicians as the opening item – acting as a warm up for the musicians, and as a means of grabbing the attention of the audience.

===Kriti===

Carnatic songs (kritis) are varied in structure and style, but generally consist of three units:
# Pallavi. This is the equivalent of a refrain in Western music, with 1 or 2 lines.
# Anupallavi. This is the second verse, also as 2 lines.
# Charana. The final (and longest) verse that wraps up the song. The Charanam usually borrows patterns from the Anupallavi. There can be multiple charanas.

This kind of song is called a &quot;keerthanam&quot; or a &quot;kriti&quot;. There are other possible structures for a &quot;kriti&quot;, which may in addition include swara passages named &quot;chittaswara&quot;. A &quot;chittaswara&quot; consists only of notes, and has no words. Still others have a verse at the end of the &quot;charana&quot;, called the &quot;madhyamakāla&quot;. It is sung immediately after the &quot;charana&quot;, but at double speed.

==Prominent composers==

There are many composers in Carnatic music. Purandara Dasa (1484–1564) is referred to as the &quot;Pitamaha&quot; (the father or grandfather) of Carnatic music as he formulated the basic lessons in teaching Carnatic music, and in honour of his significant contribution to Carnatic music. He structured graded exercises known as &quot;Swaravalis&quot; and &quot;Alankaras&quot;, and at the same time, introduced the &quot;Raga&quot; Mayamalavagowla as the first scale to be learnt by beginners. He also composed &quot;Gitas&quot; (simple songs) for novice students.

The contemporaries Tyagaraja (1767– 1847), Muthuswami Dikshitar, (1776–1835) and Syama Sastri, (1762–1827) are regarded as the Trinity of Carnatic music because of the quality of Syama Sastri&#x27;s compositions, the varieties of compositions of Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Tyagaraja&#x27;s prolific output in composing &quot;kritis&quot;.

Prominent composers prior to the Trinity of Carnatic music include Sripadaraja, Vyasatirtha, Kanakadasa, Vadiraja Tirtha, Arunachala Kavi, Annamacharya, Narayana Theertha, Vijaya Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Gopala Dasa, Bhadrachala Ramadas, Sadasiva Brahmendra and Oottukkadu Venkata Kavi. Other composers are Swathi Thirunal, Gopalakrishna Bharathi, Neelakanta Sivan, Patnam Subramania Iyer, Mysore Vasudevachar, Koteeswara Iyer, Muthiah Bhagavathar, Subramania Bharathiyar, Kalyani Varadarajan, M. Balamuralikrishna and Papanasam Sivan. The compositions of these composers are rendered frequently by artists of today.

Composers of Carnatic music were often inspired by religious devotion and were usually scholars proficient in one or more of the languages Kannada, Malayalam, Sanskrit, Tamil, or Telugu. They usually included a signature, called a &quot;mudra&quot;, in their compositions. For example, all songs by Tyāgarāja (who composed in Sanskrit and Telugu) have the word &quot;Tyagaraja&quot; in them, all songs by Muttuswāmi Dīkṣitar (who composed in Sanskrit and Maṇipravāl̥am) have the words &quot;Guruguha&quot; in them; songs by Śyāma Śāstri (who composed in Sanskrit and Telugu) have the words Ś&quot;yāma Kr̥ṣṇa&quot; in them; all songs by Purandaradasa (who composed in Kannada and Sanskrit) have the words &quot;Purandara Vitthala&quot;; while Gopalakrishna Bharathi (who composed in Tamil) used the signature &quot;Gopalakrishnan&quot; in his compositions. Papanasam Sivan, who has been hailed as the &quot;Tamil Tyagaraja&quot; of Carnatic music, composed in Tamil and Sanskrit, and used the signature &quot;Ramadasan&quot; in his compositions.

==Learning==
Carnatic music is traditionally taught according to the system formulated by Purandara Dasa. This involves &quot;sarali swaras&quot; (graded exercises), &quot;alankaras&quot; (exercises based on the seven talas), &quot;geetams&quot; or simple songs, and Swarajatis. After the student has reached a certain standard, &quot;varnams&quot; are taught and later, the student learns kritis. It typically takes several years of learning before a student is adept enough to perform at a concert.

The learning texts and exercises are more or less uniform across all the South Indian states. The learning structure is arranged in increasing order of complexity. The lessons start with the learning of the &quot;sarali varisai&quot; (solfege set to a particular raga).

Carnatic music was traditionally taught in the gurukula system, where the student lived with and learnt the art from his guru (perceptor). From the late 20th century onwards, with changes in lifestyles and need for young music aspirants to simultaneously pursue a parallel academic career, this system has found few takers.

Musicians often take great pride in letting people know about their Guru Parampara, or the hierarchy of disciples from some prominent ancient musician or composer, to which they belong. People whose disciple-hierarchies are often referred to are Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, Syama Sastri, Swathi Thirunal and Papanasam Sivan, among others.

In modern times, it is common for students to visit their gurus daily or weekly to learn music. Though new technology has made learning easier with the availability of quick-learn media such as learning exercises recorded on audio cassettes and CDs, these are discouraged by most gurus who emphasize that face-to-face learning is best for students.

===Notations===
Notation is not a new concept in Indian music. However, Carnatic music continued to be transmitted orally for centuries without being written down. The disadvantage with this system was that if one wanted to learn about a kriti composed, for example, by Purandara Dasa, it involved the difficult task of finding a person from Purandara Dasa&#x27;s lineage of students.

Written notation of Carnatic music was revived in the late 17th century and early 18th century, which coincided with rule of Shahaji II in Tanjore. Copies of Shahaji&#x27;s musical manuscripts are still available at the Saraswati Mahal Library in Tanjore and they give us an idea of the music and its form. They contain snippets of solfege to be used when performing the mentioned ragas.

====Melody====
Unlike classical Western music, Carnatic music is notated almost exclusively in tonic sol-fa notation using either a Roman or Indic script to represent the solfa names. Past attempts to use the staff notation have mostly failed. Indian music makes use of hundreds of ragas, many more than the church modes in Western music. It becomes difficult to write Carnatic music using the staff notation without the use of too many accidentals. Furthermore, the staff notation requires that the song be played in a certain key. The notions of key and absolute pitch are deeply rooted in Western music, whereas the Carnatic notation does not specify the key and prefers to use scale degrees (relative pitch) to denote notes. The singer is free to choose the actual pitch of the tonic note. In the more precise forms of Carnatic notation, there are symbols placed above the notes indicating how the notes should be played or sung; however, informally this practice is not followed.

To show the length of a note, several devices are used. If the duration of note is to be doubled, the letter is either capitalized (if using Roman script) or lengthened by a diacritic (in Indian languages). For a duration of three, the letter is capitalized (or diacriticized) and followed by a comma. For a length of four, the letter is capitalized (or diacriticized) and then followed by a semicolon. In this way any duration can be indicated using a series of semicolons and commas.

However, a simpler notation has evolved which does not use semicolons and capitalization, but rather indicates all extensions of notes using a corresponding number of commas. Thus, &quot;Sā&quot; quadrupled in length would be denoted as &quot;S,,&quot;.

====Rhythm====
The notation is divided into columns, depending on the structure of the &quot;tāḷaṃ&quot;. The division between a &quot;laghu&quot; and a &quot;dhrutam&quot; is indicated by a।, called a &quot;ḍaṇḍā&quot;, and so is the division between two &quot;dhrutams&quot; or a &quot;dhrutam&quot; and an &quot;anudhrutam&quot;. The end of a cycle is marked by a॥, called a &quot;double ḍaṇḍā&quot;, and looks like a caesura.

==Performance==

Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, who sit on an elevated stage. This usually consists of, at least, a principal performer, a melodic accompaniment, a rhythm accompaniment, and a drone.

Performances can be musical or musical-dramatic. Musical recitals are either vocal, or purely instrumental in nature, while musical-dramatic recitals refer to Harikatha. Regardless of what type of recital it is, what is featured are compositions which form the core of this genre of music.

===Instrumentation===

The &quot;tanpura&quot; is the traditional drone instrument used in concerts. However, tanpuras are increasingly being replaced by &quot;śruti&quot; boxes, and now more commonly, the electronic tanpura. The drone itself is an integral part of performances and furnishes stability – the equivalent of harmony in Western music.

In a vocal recital, a concert team may have one or more vocalists as the principal performer(s). Instruments, such as the Saraswati veena and/or venu flute, can be occasionally found as an accompaniment, but usually, a vocalist is supported by a violin player (who sits on his/her left). The rhythm accompanist is usually a mridangam player (who sits on the other side, facing the violin player). However, other percussion instruments such as the ghatam, kanjira and morsing frequently also accompany the main percussion instrument and play in an almost contrapuntal fashion along with the beats.

The objective of the accompanying instruments is far more than following the melody and keeping the beats. The accompaniments form an integral part of every composition presented, and they closely follow and augment the melodic phrases outlined by the lead singer. The vocalist and the violinist take turns while elaborating or while exhibiting creativity in sections like raga, niraval and kalpanaswaram.

Unlike Hindustani music concerts, where an accompanying tabla player can keep beats without following the musical phrases at times, in Carnatic music, the accompanists have to follow the intricacies of the composition since there are percussion elements such as eduppu in several compositions.

Some concerts feature a good bit of interaction with the lead musicians and accompanists exchanging notes, and accompanying musicians predicting the lead musician&#x27;s musical phrases.

===Contemporary concert content===
A contemporary Carnatic music concert (called a &quot;kutcheri&quot;) usually lasts about three hours, and comprises a number of varied compositions. Carnatic songs are composed in a particular &quot;raga&quot;, which means that they do not deviate from the notes in the &quot;raga&quot;. Each composition is set with specific notes and beats, but performers improvise extensively. Improvisation occurs in the melody of the composition as well as in using the notes to expound the beauty of the &quot;raga&quot;.

Concerts usually begin with a &quot;varnam&quot; or an invocatory item which will act as the opening piece. The &quot;varnam&quot; is composed with an emphasis on &quot;swaras&quot; of the raga, but will also have lyrics, the &quot;saahityam&quot;. It is lively and fast to get the audience&#x27;s attention. An invocatory item may usually follow the &quot;varnam&quot;.

After the &quot;varnam&quot; and/or invocatory item, the artist sings longer compositions called &quot;kirtanas&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;kriti&quot;s). Each kriti sticks to one specific &quot;raga&quot;, although some are composed with more than one raga; these are known as &quot;ragamalika&quot; (a garland of &quot;ragas&quot;).

After singing the opening &quot;kriti&quot;, usually, the performer sings the &quot;kalpanaswaram&quot; of the &quot;raga&quot; to the beat. The performer must improvise a string of &quot;swaras&quot; in any octave according to the rules of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the &quot;swaras&quot; with a phrase selected from the &quot;kriti&quot;. The violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of &quot;swara&quot;, the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the &quot;raga&quot;, have no awkward pauses or lapses in the beat of the song, and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow.

Performers then begin the main compositions with a section called &quot;raga alapana&quot; exploring the &quot;raga&quot;. In this, they use the sounds &quot;aa, ri, na, ta&quot;, etc. instead of &quot;swaras&quot; to slowly elaborate the notes and flow of the raga. This begins slowly and builds to a crescendo, and finally establishes a complicated exposition of the &quot;raga&quot; that shows the performer&#x27;s skill. All of this is done without any rhythmic accompaniment, or beat. Then the melodic accompaniment (violin or veena), expounds the &quot;raga&quot;. Experienced listeners can identify many ragas after they hear just a few notes. With the &quot;raga&quot; thus established, the song begins, usually with lyrics. In this, the accompaniment (usually violin, sometimes veena) performs along with the main performer and the percussion (such as a mridangam). In the next stage of the song, they may sing &quot;niraval&quot; or &quot;kalpanaswaram&quot; again.

In most concerts, the main item will at least have a section at the end of the item, for the percussion to perform solo (called the &quot;tani avartanam&quot;). The percussion artists perform complex patterns of rhythm and display their skill. If multiple percussion instruments are employed, they engage in a rhythmic dialogue until the main performer picks up the melody once again. Some experienced artists may follow the main piece with a &quot;ragam thanam pallavi&quot; mid-concert, if they do not use it as the main item.

Following the main composition, the concert continues with shorter and lighter songs. Some of the types of songs performed towards the end of the concerts are &quot;tillanas&quot; and &quot;thukkadas&quot; – bits of popular &quot;kriti&quot;s or compositions requested by the audience. Every concert that is the last of the day ends with a &quot;mangalam&quot;, a thankful prayer and conclusion to the musical event.

===Audience===
The audience of a typical concert will have some understanding of Carnatic music. It is also typical to see the audience tapping out the &quot;tala&quot; in sync with the artist&#x27;s performance. As and when the artist exhibits creativity, the audience acknowledge it by clapping their hands. With experienced artists, towards the middle of the concert, requests start flowing in. The artist usually sings the requests, and it helps in exhibiting the artist&#x27;s broad knowledge of the several thousand kritis that are in existence.

===Festivals===
Various music festivals featuring Carnatic music performances are held in India, and throughout the world.

With the city of Chennai (then known as Madras) emerging as the locus for Carnatic music during the 19th century, its musicians founded the Tyagaraja Aradhana festival in 1846. The Aradhana festival is an annual death-anniversary celebration of the prolific Carnatic music composer, Tyagaraja. Held in the city of Thiruvayaru, thousands of musicians attend the festival to perform his compositions. Since its inception, other festivals were started in a similar manner throughout India and abroad, such as the Chembai Sangeetholsavam in the Indian city of Guruvayur, and the Aradhana in the US city of Cleveland.

The city of Chennai also holds a six-week-long grand &quot;Music Season&quot;, which has been described as the world&#x27;s largest cultural event. The Music Season was started in 1927, to mark the opening of the Madras Music Academy. It used to be a traditional month-long Carnatic music festival, but since then it has also diversified into dance and drama, as well as non-Carnatic art forms. Some concert organisers also feature their own Carnatic music festivals during the season. Thousands of performances are held by hundreds of musicians across various venues in the city.

The Karnataka Ganakala Parishat is an annual conference of Carnatic music, held in February every year, which has lectures and demonstrations in the morning, and performances in the afternoons and evenings.

<text>Armand Zildjian (February 18, 1921 – December 26, 2002) was an American manufacturer of cymbals and the head of the Avedis Zildjian Company.

Born in Milton, Massachusetts, Armand Zildjian was the first Zildjian to be born in the United States. Armand was the heir of a cymbal-making tradition that dated back to his ancestor Avedis, who began the company in 1623 in Istanbul. By family tradition, the secrets of cymbal making were passed on only to the oldest son, but Armand&#x27;s father, Avedis Zildjian III, gave the information to both of his sons, Armand and Robert. Two years before his death, Avedis appointed Armand President of the Avedis Zildjian Company. Subsequently Robert decided to go into the cymbal business himself forming the Sabian Cymbal Company, in competition with his brother.

Armand Zildjian attended Colgate University, and served with the United States Coast Guard in the Pacific during World War II. After the war, he returned to his father&#x27;s factory in Quincy, Massachusetts, where, with the help of such music drumming stars as Chick Webb and Gene Krupa, Avedis and Armand revolutionized the cymbal business by adapting cymbals for drum sets by making them thinner.

Zildjian has an honorary degree from Berklee College of Music, is an inductee into the Percussive Hall of Fame, and has his name immortalized on the Guitar Center Rock Walk in Hollywood, California.

Armand Zildjian died on December 26, 2002, at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona.

<doc id="164193" wikidata="Q644789" url="?curid=164193" title="Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)">
<text>The Catholic University of Leuven or Louvain (, , later &quot;Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven&quot;) was founded in 1834 in Mechelen as the Catholic University of Belgium, and moved its seat to the town of Leuven in 1835, changing its name to Catholic University of Leuven. In 1968, it was split into two universities, the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and the Université catholique de Louvain, following tensions between the Dutch and French-speaking student bodies.

== History ==

=== Founding in Mechelen (1834) ===
On 8 November 1834, on the basis of authorisation in a papal brief of 13 December 1833, from Pope Gregory XVI, the Belgian bishops founded the Catholic University of Belgium () in Mechelen. About this first year, it is generally referred to as &quot;Catholic University of Mechelen&quot;. The bishops aimed to create a university &quot;to accommodate any doctrine from the Holy Apostolic See and to repudiate anything that does not flow from this august source&quot;.

The announcement of the bishops&#x27; founding of the new university in Mechelen was met with demonstrations and disturbances in the cities of Ghent, Leuven and Liège.

The first rector was the priest and historian Pierre de Ram.

=== Move of the new university to Leuven (1835) ===
The university was short-lived in Mechelen, as the bishops already moved the university to Leuven on 1 December 1835, where it took the name &quot;Catholic University of Leuven&quot;. This outraged Belgian liberal opinion, which depicted it as an attempt to usurp the past of the former Old University of Leuven. It also reinvigorated demands for the foundation of a secular university in Brussels which would lead to the foundation of the Free University of Brussels.

==== Previous universities in Leuven ====
An earlier University of Leuven was founded in 1425 by John IV, Duke of Brabant and chartered by a papal bull of Pope Martin V. It flourished for hundreds of years as the most prominent university in what would become Belgium, and one of the more prominent in Europe. Once formally integrated into the French Republic, the law of 15 September 1793, had decreed the suppression of all the colleges and universities in France and it was abolished by Decree of the Departement of the Dijle on 25 October 1797.

The region next became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1830), and William I of the Netherlands founded a new university in 1816 in Leuven as a state university () which was a secular university and where several professors from the old university continued their teaching. In 1830, the Southern Provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands became the independent state of Belgium. This university was closed in 1835.

==== Relation to the Old University of Leuven ====
With the closing of the State University of Leuven, the new Catholic University of Mechelen moved its seat to Leuven, adjusted its name and declared itself as a &quot;re-founding&quot; of the 1425 University of Leuven.

This claim to continuity with the older institution was challenged in the courts, with Belgium&#x27;s highest court issuing rulings (in 1844, 1855 and 1861) that as a matter of law the Catholic University of Leuven was a different institution created under a different charter.

Nonetheless, the Catholic University of Leuven unofficially continued to claim to be a continuation of the older institution in Leuven, in spite of the liberal protests of the time.

===Further history as unified institution (1835–1968)===
On 3 November 1859, the Catholic University celebrated the silver jubilee of its foundation. A banquet for more than five hundred guests offered by the students to the Rector and the faculty, took place the 23 November 1859, in the great festival hall of the Music Academy of Louvain.

In the year 1884, the Catholic University of Louvain celebrated solemnly its 50th anniversary.

In 1909, the Catholic University celebrated its 75th anniversary, and struck a medal where for the first time it officially used the French word &quot;réinstallation&quot; (resettlement), and the Dutch word &quot;herstelling&quot; (restoration) beginning of a new &quot;official&quot; history.

In 1914, during World War I, Leuven was looted by German troops. They set fire to a large part of the city, effectively destroying about half of it, including the university library (see below). In the early stages of the war, Allied propaganda capitalized on the German destruction as a reflection on German &quot;Kultur&quot;.

=== Split into two officially new institutions (1962–1970) ===
From its beginning in 1834, the university provided lectures only in French. Latin was sometimes used in the theology faculty, but it was essentially a French-language institution. Lectures in Dutch, the other official language of Belgium and the language spoken in Leuven, had begun to be provided in 1930 in the Catholic University of Leuven in the meantime.

In 1962, in line with constitutional reforms governing official language use, the French and Dutch sections of the Catholic University became autonomous within a common governing structure. Flemish nationalists continued to demand a division of the university, and Dutch speakers expressed resentment at privileges given to French-speaking academic staff and the perceived disdain by the local French-speaking community for their Dutch-speaking neighbours. At the time, Brussels and Leuven were both part of the officially bilingual and now defunct Province of Brabant; but unlike Brussels, Leuven had retained its Dutch-speaking character. Tensions rose when a French-speaking social geographer suggested in a televised lecture that the city of Leuven should be incorporated into an enlarged bilingual &#x27;Greater-Brussels&#x27; region. Mainstream Flemish politicians and students began demonstrating under the slogan &quot;Leuven Vlaams – Walen Buiten&quot; (&quot;Leuven [is] Flemish – Walloons out&quot;). Student demonstrations escalated into violence throughout the mid-1960s. Student unrest fueled by the history of discrimination against Flemings eventually brought down the Belgian government in February 1968.

The dispute was resolved in June 1968 by turning the Dutch-language section of the university into the independent Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, which remained in Leuven. The French-speaking university, called the Université catholique de Louvain, was moved to a greenfield campus called Louvain-la-Neuve (&quot;New Leuven&quot;), farther south in the French-speaking part of the Province of Brabant. Acrimony about the split was long-lasting. Currently, however, research collaborations and student exchanges between the two &quot;sister universities&quot; take place with increasing frequency.

==Library==

The library of the Catholic University dating from 1834 was housed in the University Hall, a building which in its oldest parts dated back to 1317. This was destroyed in August 1914 by invading German forces, with the loss of approximately 230,000 books, 950 manuscripts, and 800 incunabula. Materials lost included the Easter Island tablet bearing Rongorongo text E and the oldest Czech Bible.
After the First World War, a new library was built on the Mgr. Ladeuzeplein, designed by the American architect Whitney Warren in a neo-Flemish-Renaissance style. Construction took place between 1921 and 1928. Its monumental size is a reflection of the Allied victory against Germany, and it is one of the largest university buildings in the city. The library&#x27;s collections were rebuilt with donations from all around the world, outraged by the barbaric act which it had suffered. In 1940, during the second German invasion of Leuven, the building largely burnt down, with the loss of 900,000 manuscripts and books. The building was rebuilt after the war in accordance with Warren&#x27;s design.

The library&#x27;s tower included a 48-bell Gillett and Johnston carillon installed in 1928, and dedicated to the memory of the engineers of the United States who died in all wars. After having fallen into complete disrepair and neglect, efforts began in the early 1980s to restore the carillon. With the cooperation of the Belgian American Educational Foundation and the University, organized efforts to restore the carillon began. The restoration fell to Eijsbouts and the bell count increased to 63. The newly restored carillon was rededicated in October 1983, with a series of lectures, concerts, statements from diplomats including Ronald Reagan, and European carillon keyboard standardization agreements.

The library&#x27;s collections were again restored after the war, and by the time of the split in 1968 had approximately four million books. The separation of the university into distinct French-language and Dutch-language institutions in 1968 entailed a division of the central library holdings. This was done on the basis of alternate shelfmarks (except in cases where a work clearly belonged to one section or the other, e.g. was written by a member of faculty or bequeathed by an alumnus whose linguistic allegiance was clear). This gave rise to the factoid that encyclopedias and runs of periodicals were divided by volume between the two universities, but actually such series bear single shelfmarks.

The building on the Mgr. Ladeuzeplein is now the central library of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

<text>Musicality (&quot;music&quot;) is &quot;sensitivity to, knowledge of, or talent for music&quot; or &quot;the quality or state of being musical&quot;, and is used to refer to specific if vaguely defined qualities in pieces and/or genres of music, such as melodiousness and harmoniousness. These definitions are somewhat hampered by the difficulty of defining music, but, colloquially, &quot;music&quot; is often contrasted with noise and randomness. Judges of contest music may describe a performance as bringing the music on the page to life; of expressing more than the mere faithful reproduction of pitches, rhythms, and composer dynamic markings. In the company of two or more musicians, there is the added experience of the ensemble effect in which the players express something greater than the sum of their individual parts. A person considered musical has the ability to perceive and reproduce differences in aspects of music including pitch, rhythm, and harmony (see: ear training). Two types of musicality may be differentiated: to be able to perceive music (musical receptivity) and to be able to reproduce music in addition to creating music (musical creativity).

==Music vs. musicality==
Many studies on the cognitive and biological origins of music are centered on the question of what defines music. Can birdsong, the song structure of humpback whales, a Thai elephant orchestra, or the interlocking duets of Gibbons be considered music? This is now generally seen as a pitfall. In trying to answer this question, it is important to separate between the notions of &quot;music&quot; and &quot;musicality&quot;. Musicality – in all its complexity – can be defined as a natural, spontaneously developing set of traits based on and constrained by our biological and cognitive system, and music – in all its variety – as a social and cultural construct based on musicality. Or simply put: without musicality, there is no music.

However, it is still a challenge to demarcate precisely what makes up this complex trait we call musicality. What are the cognitive and biological mechanisms that are essential to perceive, make, and appreciate music? Only when we have identified these fundamental mechanisms are we in a position to see how these might have evolved. In other words: the study of the evolution of music cognition is dependent on a characterization of the basic mechanisms that make up musicality.

Colwyn Trevarthen has researched the musicality of babies, including its use in communication.

=== Notes ===

*&quot;Resources of a musician&quot;: a notable musician draws from several essential resources: &quot;musicality&quot;, &quot;material&quot; (voice, dexterity), &quot;practice&quot;, &quot;education&quot;
*&quot;Relation to dancing:&quot; Musicality is also related to dancing, since musicality is essential for becoming a good dancer.
*&quot;Relation to structure:&quot; Certain types of music have a regular inner structure, which a musical person is able to pick up intuitively. A viable musical structure is supportive of musicality.

<text>The Avedis Zildjian Company, simply known as Zildjian (), is a musical instrument manufacturer specializing in cymbals and other percussion instruments. Founded by the ethnic Armenian Zildjian family in the 17th-century Ottoman Empire, the company relocated to the United States in the 20th century. Today, it is the largest cymbal and drumstick maker in the world.

The company was founded in Constantinople in 1623 by Avedis Zildjian, an Armenian. Zildjian is now based in Norwell, Massachusetts. Zildjian is the oldest manufacturer of musical instruments in the world as well as one of the oldest continuously operating companies in the world. Zildjian sells cymbals, drumsticks, percussion mallets and other drum accessories under the Zildjian, Vic Firth and Balter Mallet brands.

==History==

===Beginnings===

The first Zildjian cymbals were created in 1618 by Avedis Zildjian, an Armenian metalsmith and alchemist. Like his father, who was also a metalsmith, he worked for the court of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople. He made an alloy of tin, copper, and silver into a sheet of metal, which could make musical sounds without shattering. Sultan Mustafa I gave Avedis eighty gold pieces as a bequest, in addition to officially recognizing the surname Zilciyan or Zildjian, meaning &quot;Son of a Cymbal Maker&quot; or &quot;Family of Cymbalsmiths&quot; in Armenian (with &quot;zil&quot; being Turkish for &quot;cymbal&quot;, &quot;ci&quot; meaning &quot;maker&quot;, and &quot;ian&quot; being the Armenian suffix meaning &quot;son of&quot;). In 1623 the Sultan granted him permission to leave the palace to start his own business in the Armenian sector of Constantinople, called Psamatia.

Zildjian&#x27;s shop manufactured cymbals for the &quot;mehter&quot;, Ottoman military bands consisting of wind and percussion instruments, which belonged to the Janissaries. Mehter ensembles, which were known in the West primarily for playing in battle, also performed courtly music for Ottoman rulers. The Zildjians also produced instruments for Greek and Armenian churches, Sufi dervishes, and belly dancers of the Ottoman harem, who wore finger cymbals.

After the death of Avedis, the business, and the secret for producing the metal, was handed down to several generations of male heirs. In the early 19th century, Haroutune Zildjian passed it on to his son Avedis II. In 1850, Avedis II built a 25-foot schooner, in order to sail cymbals produced in Constantinople to trade exhibitions such as the Great Exhibition in London, and to supply musicians in Europe. He died in 1865, and since his sons were too young, his brother Kerope II took over the company. He introduced a line of instruments called K Zildjian, which are used by classical musicians to this day. Kerope II died in 1909 in Constantinople.

===20th century===

Following Kerope’s death, the business returned to Avedis’s side of the family. The eldest, Haroutune II, had become a lawyer and held a high position in the Ottoman government, thus he was not interested, and being a bachelor, he passed it to Aram. He was involved in the Armenian nationalist movement and resistance to the atrocities of the ruling Sultan, Abdul Hamid II. This was a time of political upheaval when the Ottoman Empire was in decline.

During Aram&#x27;s exile, Kerope II&#x27;s daughter Victoria oversaw the Constantinople factory. There are conflicting accounts, but it is thought that Aram returned there in 1926.

Haroutune II&#x27;s son Avedis III had left Armenia for the United States in 1909, and settled in Boston, where he established a family and a confectionary business. In 1927, he received a letter from his uncle Aram, informing him that he was to become heir to the family business, and Aram came to the US. In 1928, Avedis III, his brother Puzant, and his uncle Aram Zildjian began manufacturing cymbals in Quincy, Massachusetts, and the Avedis Zildjian Co. was formed the following year in 1929.

Avedis III sought out jazz drummers like Gene Krupa to understand their needs. The new cymbals he developed were widely adopted by swing and later bebop musicians, laying the foundations of the modern drum kit and playing technique.

Sales of Zildjian cymbals dramatically increased after Ringo Starr used the product in The Beatles&#x27; appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1964. This created an enormous backorder situation. In 1968, in order to address this backlog, a second plant, the Azco factory, was opened in Meductic, New Brunswick, Canada.

In 1975, Zildjian began making K. Zildjian cymbals at the Azco plant. These were made until 1979. Within four years (1980), all K Cymbals were being made in the Norwell US plant, because the Ks demanded far more oversight. Armand worked with friends, the drummers Elvin Jones and Tony Williams to relaunch the K Series.

In early 1977, Armand Zildjian was appointed President of the Avedis Zildjian Company by his father. Soon after, Robert Zildjian split from the company amidst conflict with his brother, Armand. In 1981, Robert started making Sabian cymbals in the Canadian Azco factory.

===21st century===
In 2002, Armand died at age 81. The Zildjian alloy recipe passed to his daughters, Craigie and Debbie (14th generation), both of whom continue to run the family business from the current headquarters in Norwell, Massachusetts.

In 2010, Zildjian acquired the Vic Firth Company and in 2018 acquired the Mike Balter Mallet company.

<doc id="164200" wikidata="Q1018222" url="?curid=164200" title="Butyrka prison">
<text>Butyrskaya prison (), usually known simply as Butyrka (), is a prison in the Tverskoy District of central Moscow, Russia. In Imperial Russia it served as the central transit prison.

During the Soviet Union era (1917–1991) it held many political prisoners. Butyrka remains the largest of Moscow&#x27;s remand prisons. Overcrowding is an ongoing problem.

==History==
The first references to Butyrka prison may be traced back to the 17th century. The current building was erected in 1879 near the Butyrsk gate (, or Butyrskaya zastava) on the site of a prison-fortress which had been built by the architect Matvei Kazakov during the reign of Catherine the Great. The towers of the old fortress once housed the rebellious Streltsy during the reign of Peter I, and later on hundreds of participants of the 1863 January Uprising in Poland. Members of Narodnaya Volya were also prisoners of the Butyrka in 1883, as were the participants in the Morozov Strike of 1885. The Butyrka prison was known for its brutal regime. The prison administration resorted to violence anytime the inmates tried to protest.

Its famous inmates include the influential revolutionary poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Russian revolutionary Nikolay Bauman, and the founder of the KGB Felix Dzerzhinsky. During the February Revolution, the workers of Moscow freed all the political prisoners from the Butyrka. Following the October Revolution, Butyrka remained a place of internment for political prisoners and a transfer camp for people sentenced to be sent to the Gulag. During the Great Purge, about twenty thousand inmates at a time were imprisoned in Butyrka. Thousands of political prisoners were shot after investigations. Later, prominent political prisoners included the writers Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Yevgenia Ginzburg.

== Living conditions ==

Varlam Shalamov notes in one of his tales, that the Butyrka is extremely hot in summer; Eduard Limonov, in his drama &quot;Death in the Police Van&quot;, emphatically agrees. He says that, with the collapse of the Soviet regime, overcrowding has become a real issue; there are more than one hundred inmates in cells meant to contain ten people. In a 2019 interview the warden of the prison said &quot;The limit of our detention facility is 1,847 inmates. In fact, now when we are talking there are 2,292 people here.&quot; Most of these people are politically unreliable subjects from the Caucasus. Since epidemics are a problem, the wardens try to fill cells entirely with people with AIDS, or with tuberculosis; however, this does little to curb the problem, since many inmates are drug users, and there is at most one needle per cell. Moreover, inmates are brought to the tribunal in overcrowded police vans, so that healthy inmates are exposed to tuberculosis.

<text>&quot;The Mirror&quot; is episode 71 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and the sixth episode of the third season. It originally aired on October 20, 1961 on CBS. The episode was written by Rod Serling, who described it as &quot;the story of a tyrant and his assassins, a shattered dream and the death of a cause.&quot;

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
In a Central American dictatorship, Ramos Clemente and his four lifelong confidants, Cristo, D&#x27;Alessandro, Tabal, and Garcia, stage a successful revolution against the regime of General De Cruz. Clemente faces down De Cruz and revels in his victory, but the deposed general says that Clemente will soon learn the consequences of ruling by force and that his ornate mirror has the ability to reveal enemies in its reflection, though Clemente dismisses the latter.

When Clemente begins using the same repressive tactics used by De Cruz, a rift develops between him and his friends, now government heads. When Clemente looks into the mirror, he sees visions implying that all four of his confidantes are plotting to assassinate him. Clemente believes that the mirror reflects their true thoughts and accuses them of their supposed future crimes. A particular point of contention is Clemente&#x27;s order for mass executions of prisoners he has declared to be enemies of the state. When one confidant reproaches Clemente, Clemente throws him off a balcony to his death; later, Clemente orders two confidantes to start the executions and then secretly orders his guards to kill them as well. He shoots the last confidant himself.

Sometime later, Clemente is approached by a priest named Father Tomas, who asks him to end the executions which have been going on for a week. Clemente refuses, saying that as long as he has enemies, the executions will continue. Eventually however, Clemente seeks counsel from the priest, but finds no comfort in the priest&#x27;s response that all tyrants have but one real enemy, whom they never recognize until it is too late. Clemente takes one more look in the mirror and sees only himself. He picks up his pistol and throws it at the mirror, smashing the glass. The priest, standing outside Clemente&#x27;s office, hears the breaking glass and then a gunshot. He rushes into Clemente&#x27;s office and finds Clemente&#x27;s lifeless body sprawled on the floor, killed by his own gun when it hit the floor and discharged. &quot;The last assassin,&quot; he says, &quot;and they never learn. They never seem to learn.&quot;

<text>The Balboa, also known as &quot;Bal&quot;, is a swing dance that emerged in Southern California during the early 1930s as a response to swing music. The earliest recorded reference to Balboa is 1932. This date coincides with what is generally accepted to be the beginning of swing. The dance enjoyed huge popularity in California during the 1930s and 1940s, and was still being danced by original dancers into the 21st century.

Balboa is a dance that distinctively relies on closed position. The earliest form of the dance emerged in the high schools and dance venues of southern California. Spaces were often limited, the floor was waxed and there was traditionally a line of dance around the room. Balboa is danced into the floor and drifts without a prescribed line of dance. Although it is not clear when, strict codes of conduct could be enforced in some venues with signs stating &#x27;no breaks&#x27;. These dance halls were usually addressing wild kicks of other dances, specifically So Cal Swing, or simply unruly dancers. Ballrooms famous as Balboa venues displayed &#x27;no-break&#x27; signs, with bouncers monitoring the dancers. 

&#x27;Pure&#x27; Balboa is a lead/ follow swing dance characterized by an upright posture with forward intent, and partners closely connecting (in numerous ways) at the lead&#x27;s right side. The dance generates shared movement, creating many different rhythmic variations most noticeable in the feet. It is a dance built around the feeling of rhythmic movement between dancers, rather than performed movements and step patterns. The dance was so varied, that original dancers might recognise where another dancer came from based on their specific style. 

Balboa is danced at any tempo, but was one swing dance that enabled dancers to reach especially high speed. While most dancers differentiate between Pure Balboa and Bal-Swing, both are considered to be a part of the range of the dance. Bal-Swing evolved when original Balboa dancers broke hold and experimented with including features of So Cal Swing dancing. In this form of Balboa a variety of rotational and linear movements -mainly generated by&#x27; out and in&#x27; movement- create spins, turns, dips, and occasionally tricks. 

As swing became more popular the jitterbug craze emerged and the lines between bal swing and a jitterbug style often seen in movies of that date, become blurred. Original dancers mixed many dance styles together also creating a distinctive So Cal style.

Much footage of original Balboa dancers, such as the Hignetts, the Thompsons, the Rafterys, the Takiers and the Steinbroners dancing at Bobby McGees can be found online.

==History==
Balboa emerged in Southern California during the early 1930s. &quot;Balboa&quot; is named after the Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach, California, where the method of dancing was first recognised as a distinctive new dancing style known to be danced consistently by large numbers of dancers. But like any dance style it may have also emerged in other SoCal communities for the same reasons as part of a general change in popular dancing amongst young people caused by a change in popular music. In later years, a newspaper article connected to the redevelopment of the Balboa Pavillion ( which had been completely refitted with historic woodwork) made claim to the Pavillion as the home of Balboa. Other recollections of original dancers and Balboa residents attribute the origins to the Rendezvous Ballroom, and unnamed individuals. Yet more reports record different explanations. All of which indicate that there may have been no specific moment of invention, rather an evolution. 

An earlier dance, of no similarity, was also named &#x27;The Balboa&#x27;. It was created for the Panama Californian Exhibition, Balboa Park, 1915-17, with illustrated instructions published in newspapers. 
Balboa dancing continued in California throughout the twentieth century and developed a number of variations which differ from the original style specifically when newer dancers and dance teachers tried to learn the dance in various ways without the benefit of the kind of recorded instructions that exist for ballroom dances. In approximately 2005 a concerted effort was made to invite original dancers to share their knowledge resulting in another range of interpretations, and discoveries.

In 1978, two long-time Balboa dancers Ed and Inez Thompson met their Balboa-dancing friends Hal and Marge Takier to discuss starting a twice-a-month Balboa dance on Sunday afternoons at a Bobby McGee&#x27;s restaurant/ nightclub in Newport. The club ran at several Bobby McGee&#x27;s locations, including Newport, Long Beach and La Brea, for four decades, and still continues as a social dance using the Bobby McGee&#x27;s name. . restaurant in Newport Beach. Video footage of the original dancers at Bobby McGee&#x27;s became highly influential in informing the Balboa dance as it is done today, with new footage constantly being discovered showing the range of the dance, previously unknown dancers and other SoCal dancing.

Alma Heaton included two pages on Balboa in his 1954 book &quot;Ballroom Dance Rhythms&quot;, and a page of instruction in &quot;Techniques of Teaching Ballroom Dance&quot;. Heaton described two Bal-Swing figures in 1967.

<text>&quot;The Grave&quot; is episode 72 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot; It originally aired on October 27, 1961 on CBS. This is one of two episodes that were filmed during season two but held over for broadcast until season three, the other being &quot;Nothing in the Dark&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
The outlaw Pinto Sykes is ambushed and killed by the men of a small town in the Old West. Some time later, gunfighter Conny Miller, who had been hired to track down Sykes, arrives in town. He goes to the saloon where the men who hired him are gathered, and is angry to learn that they had killed Sykes themselves. Moreover, on his deathbed Sykes accused Miller of being a coward, saying he had waited for Miller in Albuquerque, New Mexico and even sent word of where he was, and threatened to reach up from his grave and grab Miller if the latter ever approached it.

Miller says that Sykes was a liar, claiming he went to Albuquerque and found no sign that Sykes had ever been there, and also denies that he is at all frightened by Sykes&#x27; threat of vengeance from beyond the grave. After Sykes&#x27; vengeful, eldritch sister Ione confronts Miller, the men say they are not convinced of Miller&#x27;s story, openly admitting they themselves are frightened of Sykes. They bet Miller $20 that he is too scared to visit the grave, giving him a knife and telling him to drive it into the earth there as proof of his visit. Miller accepts the terms and departs into the cold, windy night; he reaches the grave at midnight and plants the knife as instructed, but as he attempts to leave, he is suddenly pulled back down.

When Miller fails to return the next day, Ione and the townsmen travel to the cemetery in search of him. They find him lying dead atop Sykes&#x27; grave, the knife driven through his coattail and pinning him to the ground. One man theorizes that Miller had not buttoned his coat and that the wind blew its tail over the grave; after planting the knife, Miller mistook the pinned tail for Sykes&#x27; grasping hand and died of fright. However, Ione demonstrates that the wind direction that night would have blown Miller&#x27;s coattail away from the grave, not over it, and then laughs mockingly at the stupefied men as Ione&#x27;s cloak blows in a manner similar to that of the Grim Reaper.

==&quot;The Path Through the Cemetery&quot;==
Leonard Q. Ross published a similar story in 1941, called &quot;The Path Through the Cemetery.&quot; The tale, set in Imperial Russia, describes a very timid man named Ivan, who responds to a similar challenge from a Cossack officer in the Tsar&#x27;s Army (some printings identify this officer as a captain, some as a lieutenant) with the sword he receives from the Cossack officer for the purpose, and meets a similar fate.

==&quot;The Dare&quot;==
Maria Leach authored a compilation of ghost stories called &quot;The Thing at the Foot of the Bed and Other Scary Tales&quot; in 1959 that included a story called &quot;The Dare&quot;, in which a group of kids sitting in front of a fire telling ghost stories dare one of the group to go to the grave of a man who was just buried earlier that day. The boy takes the dare, states he will stick a knife in the grave to prove he was there, and then proceeds to meet the same fate that night.

<text>Sabian is a Canadian cymbal manufacturing company based in New Brunswick. It was established in 1981 in the village of Meductic, which is now part of Lakeland Ridges, where the company is still headquartered. Sabian is considered one of the &quot;big four&quot; manufacturers of cymbals, along with Zildjian, Meinl and Paiste.

==History==
Before Sabian Cymbals was founded, its current manufacturing facility was operated by Azco, which was then a subsidiary of Avedis Zildjian. In 1968, the Zildjian company set up Azco and the plant in rural Meductic, New Brunswick under persuasion from Robert Zildjian, who, beginning in the late 1940s, had grown familiar with the area from going on salmon fishing trips. Initially, the Meductic plant was used for casting and rolling cymbals, while finishing work was done at the Zildjian plant in North Quincy, Massachusetts. By 1970, the Meductic facility handled both processes and produced about 40% of the company&#x27;s output.

After a dispute with his brother Armand following their father Avedis&#x27;s death in 1979, Robert left the family business. In 1981, he founded Sabian, naming the new company by combining the first two letters of his three children&#x27;s names—Sally, Billy, and Andy. The Zildjian company&#x27;s former operations in Meductic under &#x27;Azco&#x27; became the headquarters of the new company.

In 1982, Sabian introduced the Automatic Anvil (AA) and the Hand Hammered (HH) lines, producing 45,000 cymbals in the first year.

By 1987, Sabian was exporting 90% of their product, additionally receiving endorsements and special visits from percussionists including Gerry Brown, Martin Drew and Kiss drummer Peter Criss. In 1989, Sabian produced its first signature artist cymbals, the Jack DeJohnette ride/hi-hats, and the Carmine Appice Silver Nickel Chinese. Eight years later, due to rising demand, a larger plant was opened in Meductic.

Sabian introduced the HHX series in 2001 which brought in the Manhattan&#x27;s darker hammering techniques. In 2011, with the help of Jojo Mayer, Sabian produced the OMNI series, which was the product of years of research and development.

Sabian cymbals are still made in New Brunswick. Robert&#x27;s son Andy is the most recent president of Sabian. In January 2015, the company announced the acquisition of US cymbal manufacturer, Crescent Cymbals, moving all its production to Sabian&#x27;s factory in Canada, subsequently incorporating Crescent into its list of brands.

In 2017, Sabian sponsored &quot;The Capital Project Presents: The Final Concert&quot;, a music and film event in Fredericton, New Brunswick, making the event free of charge. Refunds were offered to people who had already purchased tickets.

<text>&quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot; is the eighth episode of the third season of the American television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and the 73rd overall. It was written by series creator/showrunner Rod Serling, based on the 1953 short story &quot;It&#x27;s a &quot;Good&quot; Life&quot; by Jerome Bixby. The episode was directed by James Sheldon, and is considered by some, such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;TV Guide&quot;, to be one of the best episodes of the series. It originally aired on November 3, 1961. The episode was one of four from the original 1959 series which formed the basis of the 1983 film &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot summary==
Six-year-old Anthony Fremont has godlike mental powers, including mind-reading. He has isolated his town of Peaksville, Ohio, from the rest of the universe. The people must grow their own food, and supplies of common household items, such as bar soap, have been dwindling. He has blocked television signals and caused cars not to work. He creates grotesque creatures, such as three-headed gophers, which he then kills. Everybody is under his rule, even his parents.

The people live in fear of Anthony, constantly telling him how everything he does is &quot;good&quot;, since he banishes anyone thinking unhappy thoughts forever to a place that he calls &quot;the cornfield.&quot; Having never experienced any form of discipline, he does not understand that his actions are harmful. He is confused when his father tells him that the neighbors are reluctant to let their children play with him after he sent several of his playmates to the cornfield.

One night each week, Anthony gives the townsfolk one hour of television, which he creates and projects onto the family TV set. The adults gather around in the Fremonts&#x27; living room, squirming uncomfortably as Anthony shows them a vision of battling dinosaurs with ample gore. Unable to voice their real feelings, they tell Anthony that it was far better than what used to be on television.

Afterwards, the adults celebrate their friend Dan Hollis&#x27;s birthday. He gets two presents from his wife — a bottle of brandy, one of only five bottles of liquor left in the village, and a Perry Como record. Dan is eager to listen to the record, but he&#x27;s reminded by everyone that Anthony does not like singing. Getting drunk from the brandy, he starts complaining about the miserable state of the town, not being able to listen to the record, and no one singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to him. Dan snaps and confronts the child, calling him a monster and a murderer. While Anthony&#x27;s anger grows, Dan yells for someone to attack him from behind and end his reign of terror. Aunt Amy (who isn&#x27;t able to sing anymore because of Anthony) tentatively reaches for a fireplace poker, but no one has the courage to act. Anthony transforms Dan into a jack-in-the-box, causing his wife to break down. The adults are horrified at what Anthony has done, and his father asks him to wish Dan into the cornfield, which Anthony does.

Anthony then causes snow to begin falling outside. The snow will kill off at least half the crops and the town will face starvation. Anthony&#x27;s father starts to rebuke Anthony about this, but his wife and the other adults look on with worried smiles on their faces. The intimidated father then smiles and tells Anthony &quot;...But it&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re making it snow, Anthony, it&#x27;s real good. And tomorrow...tomorrow&#x27;s gonna be a real good day!&quot;

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Time&quot; named this the third-best &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, behind &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; and &quot;The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street&quot;.

Rod Serling&#x27;s introduction at the beginning of this episode was recycled and digitally edited for the preshow of the Disney Parks attraction The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. In the preshow video, Serling stands in front of a service elevator door, rather than a map of the United States, and explains to guests the journey they are about to experience. The attraction, which first opened at Disney-MGM Studios in 1994, almost two decades after Serling&#x27;s death, is an homage to the original series with an original story based on it. When conceiving the attraction, Disney Imagineers wanted to include Serling in the attraction and opted for a voice artist to play him; Mark Silverman was chosen by Serling&#x27;s widow to provide his voice. A poster advertising &quot;Anthony Fremont&#x27;s Orchestra&quot; is displayed next to the concierge desk in the lobby of the attraction, an ironic reference to Anthony&#x27;s hatred of singing.

In 1997 &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the episode number 31 on its 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list.

The opening narration of this episode is sampled in &quot;Threatened&quot; by Michael Jackson in his 2001 album, &quot;Invincible&quot;.

===Remake===
In a 1974 interview with Marvel Comics, Rod Serling said &quot;I&#x27;m on my third draft of a feature film based on Jerome Bixby&#x27;s short story, &#x27;It&#x27;s a Good Life&#x27;. We did it originally on &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, but now we&#x27;re doing a full-length version. Alan Landsburg, who produced &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot;, is producing it. It&#x27;s in the fantasy-horror genre.&quot; This was one of Serling&#x27;s last interviews before his death in 1975.

&quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;″s &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot; segment is a remake of the original episode, and is directed by Joe Dante.

===Pop culture===
The 1980 song &quot;Cemetery Girls&quot; by novelty rock group Barnes &amp; Barnes refers to the episode in its lyrics (&quot;Fresh souls in the cornfield...Anthony put them there...&quot;), and with samples of lines. Since the album was released several years before fictional twin brothers Art (Bill Mumy) Barnes and Artie (Robert Haimer) went &quot;public&quot; about their identities, the reference is an in-joke.

This episode was also remade as a parody in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror II&quot; in 1991, with Bart in the role of Anthony.

The 1997 episode &quot;Johnny Real Good&quot; from &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; is also based on this episode. Johnny has to babysit a boy named Timmy, who also has supernatural powers and sends Johnny several times to a nearby cornfield for &quot;thinking bad thoughts.&quot;

The 2007 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&quot; uses the episode as an analogy for life under the dictator Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic.

The 2017 &quot;Black Mirror&quot; episode &quot;USS Callister&quot; was conceived with the episode as an inspiration.

===Sequel===
In the 2002 revival series, a sequel to this episode was broadcast, titled &quot;It&#x27;s Still a Good Life&quot;, making it the only &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode to have a sequel. In the episode, Anthony is a middle-aged man who now has a daughter Audrey who has inherited his powers. Bill Mumy and Cloris Leachman reprised their roles from the original episode. Anthony Fremont&#x27;s daughter, Audrey, is played by actor Bill Mumy&#x27;s real-life daughter Liliana Mumy.

A commercial for MeTV airing on that channel in 2015 features an adult Bill Mumy as adult Anthony intercut with scenes from the original episode, apparently interacting as the adult Anthony uses his powers to beam Me-TV to little Anthony&#x27;s set. In early 2017, the network used clips from this episode in promos for the show&#x27;s late-night reruns.

<doc id="164206" wikidata="Q2770678" url="?curid=164206" title="Deaths-Head Revisited">
<text>&quot;Deaths-Head Revisited&quot; is episode 74 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The story is about a former SS officer revisiting the Dachau concentration camp a decade and a half after World War II. The title is a play on the Evelyn Waugh novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, and the SS &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; units who administered the camps. In Germany this episode was never brought to TV.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Gunther Lutze, a former SS captain, checks into a hotel in Dachau, Bavaria, under the name &quot;Schmidt&quot;. The receptionist seems to recognize him, but he deflects suspicion by claiming to have served in the panzer division on the Eastern Front during World War II. He asks if a nearby camp is a prison. When the receptionist says it was used as a kind of prison, he presses her for a further explanation, though it soon becomes clear that he knows the exact purpose of the camp.

He goes to the site, the now-abandoned Dachau concentration camp, to recall his time as its commandant during the war. As he strolls around the camp, he revels in the memory of the torment he inflicted on the inmates. He is surprised to see Alfred Becker, one of the camp&#x27;s former inmates and a particular victim of Lutze&#x27;s cruelty, and equally surprised that Becker seems unchanged by the intervening 17 years.

Lutze supposes that Becker is now the caretaker of the camp, which Becker confirms &quot;in a manner of speaking.&quot; As they talk, Becker relentlessly confronts Lutze with the reality of his grossly inhumane actions, while Lutze insists that he was only following orders. Lutze tries to dismiss Becker&#x27;s description of cruelty by saying that the war is over and that he has moved on.

Lutze tries to leave, but finds the gate locked. Becker asks why he came back, given that he changed his name and fled to South America. Lutze argues that he hoped that with the passage of enough time, the world would have moved on and people would be willing to forget his &quot;little mistakes of the past.&quot; Becker retorts that Lutze&#x27;s actions were not mistakes, but crimes against humanity.

Becker and a dozen other ghostly inmates put Lutze on trial for his actions, which include ordering the deaths of over 1,700 innocent people without trial or due process, maiming and torturing thousands of human beings without provocation, the criminal experimentation on women and children, the murder of at least 14 people by his own hand, and calling and signing into effect orders for the gassing and cremating of one million human beings. Lutze screams and passes out.

Upon awaking, Lutze tells Becker he imagined the trial. Becker contradicts this, and informs Lutze of the guilty verdict. When Becker is about to pronounce the sentence to the court, Lutze mocks him as mad until he suddenly remembers that on the night American troops came close to Dachau 17 years before, he personally killed Becker and several other inmates and attempted to burn down the camp.

As punishment, Lutze is made to undergo the same horrors he imposed on the inmates in the form of tactile illusions, including being shot by machine guns at the gate, hanging by the gallows and torture at the detention building. He screams in agony from the illusions and collapses. Before departing, Becker&#x27;s ghost informs him, &quot;This is not hatred. This is retribution. This is not revenge. This is justice. But this is only the beginning, Captain. Only the beginning. Your final judgment will come from God.&quot;

Lutze is found by authorities, sedated by a doctor, and taken to a mental institution, since he continues to experience and react to his illusory sufferings. His finders wonder how a man who was perfectly calm two hours before could have gone insane so soon. The doctor then looks around and says, &quot;Dachau. Why does it still stand? Why do we keep it standing?&quot;

==Closing narration==
==Episode and cast notes==
* Hungarian-born actor Oscar Beregi Jr (SS Captain Lutze), whose father was Jewish, had many screen roles as villains and &#x27;heavies&#x27;, and would have been familiar to American TV audiences of the time for his work in the popular TV detective series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, where he had a recurring role as thuggish mobster Joe Kulak. This episode also marked Beregi&#x27;s second appearance in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;—his first was as the leader of the criminal gang in the Season 2 episode &quot;The Rip Van Winkle Caper&quot;.
* Alfred Becker, Lutze&#x27;s supernatural adversary and judge, was played by distinguished Austrian-born character actor Joseph Schildkraut. He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Captain Alfred Dreyfus in &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; (1937), although he would have been best known to contemporary audiences for his role as the father Otto Frank in both the Broadway stage version and the 1959 film version of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;.
* Kaaren Verne, who makes a brief appearance as the hotel receptionist in the episode&#x27;s opening scene (credited as &quot;Karen Verne&quot;), had enjoyed a flourishing career in the Berlin State Theatre before she and her first husband were forced to flee Germany in 1938. She eventually settled in the US, where she soon became an outspoken opponent of the Nazi regime. In the mid-1940s, she was married for several years to renowned expatriate Hungarian-born Jewish actor Peter Lorre.
* Veteran British-born character actor Ben Wright (The Doctor) trained at RADA with Ida Lupino and worked on stage and screen in the UK before emigrating to the US in 1946. After becoming established in Hollywood, Wright&#x27;s much-admired facility with accents and dialects saw him play a wide range of character parts in radio and on screen, portraying English, German, French, Australian, and even Chinese characters. He was also in &quot;Judgment Night&quot;. Additionally, he played the Gauleiter of Austria Herr Zeller in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. He was also a noted voice actor, and performed featured voice parts in Disney&#x27;s &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, which was his final screen credit before his death.
* In an archival audio interview, attached as a special feature to the episode in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; DVD boxed set, series producer Buck Houghton recalled that for this episode, the production was able to shoot the episode&#x27;s exterior scenes in a large frontier fort set that had recently been built for the pilot for an unnamed Western TV series. Because that series had not been picked up by any of the networks, this very expensive set—which, according to Houghton, had cost US$200,000 (around US$1.6 million in 2016)—was then sitting abandoned on the MGM backlot, and only required minimal redressing to serve as the episode&#x27;s setting, the Dachau concentration camp.
* Houghton recalled that episode director Don Medford was mainly known as an &quot;action&quot; director, but that he was chosen both for his ability to create effective &quot;shock&quot; moments, and for his willingness to allow emotional scenes to play out as long as he felt necessary. According to Houghton, Medford was also known for his meticulous preparation, although Houghton also recalled that Medford could become flustered if events during production (such as the unexpected unavailability of an actor) forced him to deviate from his production plans.
* Houghton also heaped praise on the work of British-born actor Ben Wright (who appears briefly as The Doctor at the end of the episode), noting that Wright had the ability to master any kind of accent or dialect convincingly, and this allowed him to play a wide range of nationalities during his long screen career.
* The story was later adapted for &quot;The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas&quot; starring H.M. Wynant in the Oscar Beregi role.

==Critical response==

Gordon F. Sander, excerpt from &quot;Serling: The Rise and Twilight of Television&#x27;s Last Angry Man&quot;:
:Serling meted out nightmarish justice of a worse kind in &quot;Deaths-Head Revisited&quot; (directed by Don Medford), Serling&#x27;s statement on the Holocaust, written in reaction to the then-ongoing Eichmann trial, in which a former Nazi, played by Oscar Beregi, on a nostalgic visit to Dachau, is haunted and ultimately driven insane by the ghosts of inmates he had killed there during the war.

==In popular culture==
The introduction to the instrumental song &quot;Intro to Reality&quot; from the 1990 album &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; by the heavy metal band Anthrax featured dialogue spoken by the character Alfred Becker quoting, &quot;We did as we were told.&quot; and &quot;They just heard you offer the apology for all the monsters of our times.&quot; spoken to Lutze from this episode. The instrumental segues into the next song, &quot;Belly of The Beast&quot; which is a tribute to the story itself from Becker&#x27;s point of view.

<text>&quot;The Midnight Sun&quot; is episode 75 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, first shown in November, 1961.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
The Earth&#x27;s orbit has been perturbed, causing the planet to slowly fall into the Sun. A prolific artist, Norma, and her landlady, Mrs. Bronson, are the last residents in their New York apartment building. Their former neighbors have either moved north to seek a cooler climate or they have already perished from the extremely high temperatures.

At twenty minutes to midnight, it is and sunny as high noon. Norma and Mrs. Bronson try to support each other as they watch life as they know it erode around them. The streets are deserted, water usage is limited to an hour a day, and their electricity is gradually being turned off. Food and water are scarce and the sea has dried up. A radio presenter announces that the police have been moved out of the city and that citizens must defend themselves against looters, then angrily goes off script before being forcibly taken off the air.

As the temperature rises to , the two women grow weaker. Norma burns her hand on a windowsill. Mrs. Bronson becomes psychologically unstable, beseeching Norma to paint a picture of a cool subject, rather than Norma&#x27;s usual paintings of the Sun and burning cities. A looter enters the building through the roof door, which Mrs. Bronson neglected to lock. They hide in Norma&#x27;s apartment. The looter calls from outside, demanding entry. Norma threatens him with a revolver, and they hear him walk away.

Against Norma&#x27;s pleas, Mrs. Bronson unlocks the door, and the stranger forces his way in, grabs the revolver and drinks their water. He calms down after seeing their distress and begs for their forgiveness, claiming that he is an honest man driven insane by the heat. He throws away the revolver and describes the recent death of his wife and newborn child. He begs for forgiveness until Norma acknowledges him; he then leaves the building.

In an attempt to console Mrs. Bronson, Norma shows her an oil painting of a waterfall cascading into a lush pond. Mrs. Bronson deliriously claims that she can feel the coolness and splashes in the imaginary waters before dying from heat stroke. Norma sits in shock as the thermometer surges past and shatters. The paint on the paintings begins to melt; she screams and collapses.

The scene cuts to the same apartment at night with heavy snow outside the windows. The thermometer reads . Norma, who has been bedridden with a high fever, is being cared for by a doctor and Mrs. Bronson. The Earth moving closer to the Sun is revealed to be only a fever dream, while in reality the Earth is moving &quot;away from&quot; the Sun, and the world&#x27;s inhabitants are actually freezing to death.

Norma tells Mrs. Bronson about her nightmare, adding, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it wonderful to have darkness, and coolness?&quot; Mrs. Bronson’s face stiffens in dread, and she replies, &quot;Yes, my dear. It’s...wonderful.&quot;

==Closing narration==
==Production notes==
The effect of the oil paintings melting was accomplished by painting the pictures in wax on the surface of a hotplate. Moreover, the episode was shot in the summer, on a set without air-conditioning, with the director actually turning up the heat on certain key scenes to create the necessary mood and appearance for the story.

==Deleted characters==
Serling&#x27;s original script featured two characters who did not appear in the completed episode: a police officer and a refrigerator repairman.

&quot;I spent a lot of time with Buck Houghton, &quot;Twilight Zone&#x27;s&quot; producer trying to reduce scripts, some by Rod, by one speaking part or two speaking parts because we were just about to start shooting the show and we were over budget. And Aubrey was really tough on this subject even if it were a small number of dollars.&quot; —Del Reisman quoted in &quot;Serling: The Rise And Twilight of Television&#x27;s Last Angry Man&quot;.

==Critical response==
J. Hoberman, excerpt from &quot;America&#x27;s Twilight Zone&quot;, published in &quot;Visions From the Twilight Zone&quot; by Arlen Schumer:
:Whether explicitly nuclear or otherwise, the apocalypse was never far away [in the Twilight Zone]. &quot;The Midnight Sun&quot; was telecast on the day the U.S. consolidated its drive for &quot;push-button warfare&quot; with the first successful launching of a Minuteman missile from an underground silo. The episode substitutes a kink in the Earth&#x27;s orbit—an analogue to what we currently call &quot;the greenhouse effect&quot;—for an atomic holocaust. Instead of blowing up, the planet is falling into the sun. Rape and pillage seem imminent, and even the pigment is boiling on the heroine-artist&#x27;s canvases as the radio weatherman goes nuts on the air.

<text>&quot;Still Valley&quot; is episode 76 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Opening narration==
The narration continues after dialogue between Paradine and Dauger.

==Plot==
During the Civil War, two Confederate Army soldiers have been assigned to scout on the Union Army troops that are advancing into the valley below. Sergeant Joseph Paradine hears the troops approaching, but suddenly the sound stops. He decides to descend into the valley to see the cause for himself. His companion refuses to accompany him.

When Paradine gets into town, he finds the troops there, but all of them are motionless, frozen in time. He tries unsuccessfully to wake them. Finally he comes across an old man named Teague, the sole remaining inhabitant of the town, who is unaffected by the strange phenomenon. Teague claims to be a &quot;witch-man&quot; and says he used a magic spell to freeze the soldiers. Paradine does not believe him, so Teague casts the spell on Paradine, freezing him.

When Teague lifts the spell on Paradine, he claims that he could stop the entire Union Army in this manner, ensuring the success of the Confederacy. Paradine asks why he has not done so, and Teague replies that he is dying and will be dead by the day&#x27;s end. He gives his book of spells to Paradine, encouraging him to use it, but when Paradine looks in it, he realizes that using this magic would require him to align himself with Satan, which Teague acknowledges.

Teague dies, and Paradine returns to camp to tell his superior about what happened. The superior does not believe him and orders him to get some rest. When another scout returns to report that an entire company of Union troops is standing frozen near the camp, Paradine reveals that he cast a spell on them from the book. Once he describes his encounter with the old man, his superior urges him to continue reading from the book since Satan may be the only ally who can help the Confederacy win the war.

Paradine discovers that using the book&#x27;s magic requires that not only must he praise the name of the Devil, but he must renounce the name of God. Rather than do either, Paradine throws the book into a campfire, saying that if the Confederacy is to die, it should be buried in hallowed ground. The next day, Paradine receives orders that his unit is going to march to Gettysburg.

==Closing narration==
==Cast==
* Gary Merrill as Sergeant Joseph Paradine
* Vaughn Taylor as Teague
* Ben Cooper as Dauger
* Mark Tapscott as Lieutenant 
* Jack Mannas as Mallory

==Episode notes==
*The episode is based on a 1939 short story, &quot;The Valley Was Still&quot; by Manly Wade Wellman.
*In the original story, Paradine kills Teague when he finds that to make the spell book work, he must sign his name in blood (making a contract with the Devil); later when the spell on the soldiers is broken when the book is burned-both Union and Confederates have a big battle in the valley.

<text>Joseph Jacob Foss (April 17, 1915January 1, 2003) was a United States Marine Corps Major and a leading Marine fighter ace in World War II. He received the Medal of Honor in recognition of his role in air combat during the Guadalcanal Campaign. In postwar years, he was an Air National Guard Brigadier General, served as the 20th Governor of South Dakota (1955–1959), president of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and the first commissioner of the American Football League. He also was a television broadcaster.

==Early years==
Foss was born in an unelectrified farmhouse near Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the oldest son of Mary Esther (née Lacey) and Frank Ole Foss. He was of Norwegian and Scottish descent. At age 12, he visited an airfield in Renner to see Charles Lindbergh on tour with his aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis. Four years later, he and his father paid $1.50 apiece to take their first aircraft ride in a Ford Trimotor at Black Hills Airport with a famed South Dakota aviator, Clyde Ice.

In March 1933, while coming back from the fields during a storm, his father was killed when he drove over a downed electrical cable and was electrocuted as he stepped out of his automobile. Young Foss, not yet 18 years old, pitched in with his mother and brother Cliff to continue running the family farm. Farming was made difficult by dust storms, which over the next two years took its toll on crops and livestock.

After watching a Marine Corps aerial team, led by Capt. Clayton Jerome, perform aerobatics in open-cockpit biplanes, he was determined to become a Marine aviator. Foss worked at a service station to pay for books and college tuition, and to begin flight lessons from Roy Lanning, at the Sioux Skyway Airfield in 1938, scraping up $65 to pay for the instruction. His younger brother took over the management of the farm and allowed Foss to go back to school and graduate from Washington High School in Sioux Falls. He graduated from the University of South Dakota in 1939 with a degree in business administration.

While at USD, Foss and other like-minded students convinced authorities to set up a CAA flying course at the university; he built up 100 flight hours by graduation. Foss paid his way through university by &quot;bussing&quot; tables. He joined the Sigma chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and excelled at sports in USD, fighting on the college boxing team, participating as a member of the track team and as a second-string guard on the football team.

Foss served as a Private in the 147th Field Artillery Regiment, Sioux Falls, South Dakota National Guard from 1939 to 1940. By 1940, armed with a pilot certificate and a college degree, Foss hitchhiked to Minneapolis to enlist in the Marine Corps Reserves, in order to join the Naval Aviation Cadet program to become a Naval Aviator.

==Military career==
===Effort to become a fighter pilot===
Foss was accepted by the Marine Corps for flight school and commissioning. After graduation from flight school at NAS Pensacola, Florida he was designated a Naval Aviator and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, in the Marine Corps. He was then assigned as a &quot;plowback&quot; instructor at Pensacola teaching Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard students to be Naval Aviators. At 27 years of age, he was considered too old to be a fighter pilot, and was instead sent to the Navy School of Photography. Upon completion of his initial assignment, he was transferred to Marine Photographic Squadron 1 (VMO-1) stationed at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California. Dissatisfied with his role in photographic reconnaissance, Foss made repeated requests to be transferred to a fighter qualification program. He checked out in Grumman F4F Wildcats while still assigned to VMO-1, logging over 150 flight hours in June and July, 1942, and was eventually transferred to Marine Fighting Squadron 121 VMF-121 as the executive officer. While stateside, Foss married his high school sweetheart, June Shakstad in 1942.
===Guadalcanal Flying Ace===
In October 1942, VMF-121 pilots and aircraft were sent to Guadalcanal as part of Operation Watchtower to relieve VMF-223, which had been fighting for control of the air over the island since mid-August. On October 9, Foss and his group were catapult launched off the escort carrier and flew north to reach Guadalcanal. The air group, code named &quot;Cactus&quot;, based at Henderson Field became known as the Cactus Air Force, and their presence played a pivotal role in the Battle of Guadalcanal. Foss soon gained a reputation for aggressive close-in fighter tactics and uncanny gunnery skills. Foss shot down a Japanese Zero on his first combat mission on October 13, but his own F4F Wildcat was shot up as well, and with a dead engine and three more Zeros on his tail, he landed at full speed, with no flaps and minimal control on Henderson Field, barely missing a grove of palm trees. On 7 November his Wildcat was again hit, and he survived a ditching in the sea off the island of Malaita.
As lead pilot in his flight of eight Wildcats, the group soon became known as &quot;Foss&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, with two sections Foss nicknamed &quot;Farm Boys&quot; and &quot;City Slickers.&quot; In December 1942, Foss contracted malaria. He was sent to Sydney, Australia for rehabilitation, where he met Australian ace Clive &quot;Killer&quot; Caldwell and delivered some lectures on operational flying to RAF pilots, newly assigned to the theater. On January 1, 1943, Foss returned to Guadalcanal, to continue combat operations which lasted until February 9, 1943, although the Japanese attacks had waned from the height of the November 1942 crisis. In three months of sustained combat, Foss&#x27;s Flying Circus had shot down 72 Japanese aircraft, including 26 credited to him. Upon matching the record of 26 kills held by America&#x27;s top World War I ace, Eddie Rickenbacker, Foss was accorded the honor of becoming America&#x27;s first &quot;ace-of-aces&quot; in World War II. One of the Japanese he shot down was ace Kaname Harada, who became a peace activist and met Foss many years later.

Foss returned to the United States in March 1943. On May 18, 1943, Foss received the Medal of Honor from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The White House ceremony was featured in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, with the reluctant Captain Foss appearing on the magazine&#x27;s cover. He then was asked to participate in a war bond tour that stretched into 1944.

===Return to combat===

In February 1944, Foss returned to the Pacific theater to lead VMF-115, flying the F4U Corsair. VMF-115 was based in the combat zone around Emirau, St. Mathias Group in 1944. It was during this second tour that Foss met and became friends with fellow Marine fighter ace Marion Carl. He also had an opportunity to meet and fly with his boyhood idol, Charles Lindbergh, who was on assignment touring the South Pacific as an aviation consultant. After eight months of operational flying but no opportunities to increase his wartime score, Foss finished his combat service as one of America&#x27;s top scoring pilots.

Foss again contracted malaria, and was sent home to the Klamath Falls, Oregon Rehabilitation Center. In February 1945, he became operations and training officer at the Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara, California.

==Postwar==

===Air National Guard===
In August 1945, Foss was released to inactive duty and opened &quot;Joe Foss Flying Service&quot;, charter flying service and flight instruction school in Sioux Falls, that eventually grew into a 35-aircraft operation. With a friend, Duane &quot;Duke&quot; Corning, he later owned a Packard car dealership in the town.

In October 1945, Foss was ordered to appear at Navy Day ceremonies in four cities there and was finally relieved from active duty in December 1945 but was retained in the Marine Corps Reserve on inactive duty until 1947. In 1946, Foss was appointed a Lieutenant Colonel in the South Dakota Air National Guard and instructed to form the South Dakota Air National Guard, becoming the Commanding Officer for the Guard&#x27;s 175th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. During the unit&#x27;s formative years, Foss was actively involved in administration and flying with the squadron, even becoming a member of their North American P-51 Mustang air demonstration team. During the Korean War, Foss, then a Colonel, was called to active duty with the United States Air Force, relinquishing command of the 175th Squadron, and served as a Director of Operations and Training for the Central Air Defense Command; he eventually reached the rank of Brigadier General.

===Political career===

Campaigning from the cockpit of a light aircraft, Foss served two elected terms as a Republican representative in the South Dakota legislature and, beginning in 1955, at age 39, as the state&#x27;s youngest governor. During his tenure as governor, he accompanied Tom Brokaw, then a high school student and Governor of South Dakota American Legion Boys State, to New York City for a joint appearance on &quot;Two for the Money&quot;, a television game show, which featured Foss because of his wartime celebrity. Foss had previously appeared on the long-running game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; on May 1, 1955. 

In 1958, Foss unsuccessfully sought a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, having been defeated by another wartime pilot hero, the Democrat George McGovern. Foss tried to re-enter politics in 1962 in a campaign to succeed Sen. Francis Case, who died in office. Foss and several other contenders lost to Joseph H. Bottum, who filled out Case&#x27;s term.

==Later careers==
===American Football League===
After serving as governor, Foss spent a short time working for Raven Industries before becoming the first Commissioner of the newly created American Football League in 1959. He oversaw the emergence of the league as the genesis of modern professional football. During the next seven years, Foss helped expand the league and made lucrative television deals, including the initial five-year, $10.6 million contract with ABC in 1960 to broadcast AFL games. The next contract was also for five years, but with NBC for a substantially greater $36 million, starting in 1965.

Foss stepped aside as commissioner in April 1966, two months before the historic agreement that led to the merger of AFL and NFL and the creation of the Super Bowl. Al Davis succeeded him, but disagreed with the merger and resigned after months. Milt Woodard, the assistant commissioner under Foss, was named to the new office of president of the AFL in July and served through the league&#x27;s final season in 1969.

===Television career===
Drawing on a lifelong love of hunting and the outdoors, Foss hosted ABC television&#x27;s &quot;The American Sportsman&quot; from 1964 to 1967, which took him around the world for hunting and fishing excursions. He then hosted and produced his own syndicated outdoors TV series, &quot;The Outdoorsman: Joe Foss&quot;, from 1967 to 1974. In 1972, he also began a six-year stint as Director of Public Affairs for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.

===National Rifle Association===
Starting in 1988, Foss was elected to two consecutive one-year terms as president of the National Rifle Association of America. In his later years he maintained a rigorous speaking schedule and spoke out for conservative causes on what he considered a weakening of gun owners&#x27; rights. He was portrayed on the cover of the 29 January 1990 issue of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; wearing his trademark Stetson hat and holding a revolver.

===Philanthropy===

Foss, who had a daughter with cerebral palsy, served as President of the National Society of Crippled Children and Adults. Foss&#x27;s other charities included the Easter Seals campaign, Campus Crusade for Christ, and an Arizona program for disadvantaged youths.

===The Joe Foss Institute===
In 2001, Foss and his second wife, &quot;Didi,&quot; founded the Joe Foss Institute, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The institute works with veterans and educators around the United States to educate the nation&#x27;s youth on history and civics, and to inspire them to become informed and engaged citizens. Through classroom presentations, curriculum and scholarships, the Joe Foss Institute has served more than 1.35 million children, as of June 2014, nationwide. Currently, the institute offers three primary programs; Veterans Inspiring Patriotism (VIP), You are America Civics Series and scholarship contests which run year-round. Foss did many of these school visits himself, speaking to children of all ages about service, responsibility, patriotism, integrity and commitment.
===Other honors and recognition===
Foss co-authored or was the subject of three books including the wartime &quot;Joe Foss: Flying Marine&quot; (with Walter Simmons); &quot;Top Guns&quot; (with Matthew Brennan); and &quot;A Proud American&quot; by his wife, Donna Wild Foss. Foss also provided the foreword to &quot;Above and Beyond: the Aviation Medals of Honor&quot; by Barrett Tillman, and was profiled in Tom Brokaw&#x27;s 1998 book about World War II and its warriors, &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;. Brokaw characterized Foss: &quot;He had a hero&#x27;s swagger but a winning smile to go with his plain talk and movie-star looks. Joe Foss was larger than life, and his heroics in the skies over the Pacific were just the beginning of a journey that would take him to places far from that farm with no electricity and not much hope north of Sioux Falls.&quot;&quot;Brave Eagle&quot;, a 1955 postwar effort to film a story of Foss&#x27;s life, starring his friend, John Wayne, fell through in 1956 when Foss refused to allow the producers to add a fictitious love story. &quot;American Ace: The Joe Foss Story&quot; was an award-winning, hour-length television documentary, produced by the South Dakota Public Broadcasting, first aired in fall 2006.

Foss was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1984. He also was a president and board chairman of the Air Force Association and as a Director of the United States Air Force Academy. In 2000, he served as a consultant on the popular computer game &quot;Combat Flight Simulator 2&quot; by Microsoft. A complete listing of Foss&#x27;s affiliations and honors is given at The Joe Foss Institute.

==Later years==

On January 11, 2002, Foss, then 86, was in the news when he was detained by security at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. He was scheduled to deliver an address at the National Rifle Association and speak to a class at the United States Military Academy at West Point. A search necessitated by his pacemaker precluding a metal detector screening had led to the discovery of the star-shaped Medal of Honor, along with a clearly marked dummy-bullet keychain, a second replica bullet and a small nail file (with MOH insignia).

The incident caused a furor with both media and public support given to Foss. Newsman Jack Cafferty noted that airport security personnel demonstrated poor judgment in not recognizing the Medal of Honor and in demanding to confiscate and destroy the medal and related memorabilia. He eventually lost a souvenir replica bullet, but was able to retain his Medal of Honor and commemorative nail file, by shipping it back to himself.

&quot;I wasn&#x27;t upset for me ... I was upset for the Medal of Honor, that they just didn&#x27;t know what it even was. It represents all of the guys who lost their lives – the guys who never came back. Everyone who put their lives on the line for their country. You&#x27;re supposed to know what the Medal of Honor is&quot;, he said. The incident led to a national debate about post 9/11 airport security practices and their ramifications on the average citizen.

==Death==
Foss suffered a stroke in October 2002 when he bled from a cerebral aneurysm. He died three months later on New Year&#x27;s Day, 2003, never having regained consciousness, in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he and his wife had made their home in later years. Vice President Dick Cheney, retired Lt. Colonel Oliver North and South Dakota native and NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw were among those who attended with North delivering the eulogy.

Actor Charlton Heston gave a brief tribute to his old friend. Foss was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Section 7A, Lot 162 on January 21, 2003. Family, friends, military personnel and dignitaries remembered him fondly at a service in Arlington and at an earlier &quot;Memorial Service for an American Patriot&quot; in the old chapel at nearby Fort Myer.

==Memorials==
A number of institutions and locations have been named in honor of Foss, including Marine Corps Air Station Miramar Joe Foss Field, the Joe Foss Field Air National Guard Station in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the Joe Foss Field at the Sioux Falls Regional Airport , Joe Foss High School also in Sioux Falls, and the State Building in Pierre, South Dakota. A larger-than-life bronze statue of Foss stands in the lobby of the Sioux Falls Regional Airport.

The Joe Foss Shooting Complex in Buckeye, Arizona, is also named in his honor. A private road in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned by General Dynamics, was renamed &quot;Joe Foss Way&quot; and dedicated on May 20, 2003.

In 1984, Foss was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio. 

Foss was inducted into the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida, in 1994.

==Aerial victories==

The Marine Corps credits Foss with 26 air victories, and Marine ace Robert M. Hanson with 25 victories. However, the Marine Corps credits Marine ace Gregory &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington with 28 American victories. This is due to Boyington&#x27;s (22 Marine victories) wartime claim of 6 victories scored while serving with the Flying Tigers (American Volunteer Group-AVG) in China at the beginning of World War II, prior to him rejoining the Marine Corps;

AVG records show that Boyington was paid for 3.5 enemy aircraft destroyed (2-air, 1.5-ground). The American Fighter Aces Association credits Boyington with 24 victories (22 with the Marine Corps and 2 with the AVG).

<text>Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus species in the genus &quot;Tobamovirus&quot; that infects a wide range of plants, especially tobacco and other members of the family Solanaceae. The infection causes characteristic patterns, such as &quot;mosaic&quot;-like mottling and discoloration on the leaves (hence the name). TMV was the first virus to be discovered. Although it was known from the late 19th century that a non-bacterial infectious disease was damaging tobacco crops, it was not until 1930 that the infectious agent was determined to be a virus. It is the first pathogen identified as a virus. The virus was crystallised by Wendell Meredith Stanley. It has a similar size to the largest synthetic molecule, known as PG5 with comparable length and diameter.

== History ==
In 1886, Adolf Mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants, similar to bacterial infections. In 1892, Dmitri Ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent, showing that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through the finest Chamberland filters. Later, in 1903, Ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells of the affected tobacco plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent. However, Ivanovsky remained rather convinced, despite repeated failures to produce evidence, that the causal agent was an unculturable bacterium, too small to be retained on the employed Chamberland filters and to be detected in the light microscope. In 1898, Martinus Beijerinck independently replicated Ivanovsky&#x27;s filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant. Beijerinck adopted the term of &quot;&quot; to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature. &quot;Tobacco mosaic virus&quot; was the first virus to be crystallized. It exhibit liquid crystal phases above a critical density. It was achieved by Wendell Meredith Stanley in 1935 who also showed that TMV remains active even after crystallization. For his work, he was awarded 1/4 of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946, even though it was later shown some of his conclusions (in particular, that the crystals were pure protein, and assembled by autocatalysis) were incorrect. The first electron microscopical images of TMV were made in 1939 by Gustav Kausche, Edgar Pfankuch and Helmut Ruska – the brother of Nobel Prize winner Ernst Ruska. In 1955, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified TMV RNA and its capsid (coat) protein assemble by themselves to functional viruses, indicating that this is the most stable structure (the one with the lowest free energy).
The crystallographer Rosalind Franklin worked for Stanley for about a month at Berkeley, and later designed and built a model of TMV for the 1958 World&#x27;s Fair at Brussels. In 1958, she speculated that the virus was hollow, not solid, and hypothesized that the RNA of TMV is single-stranded. This conjecture was proven to be correct after her death and is now known to be the + strand. The investigations of tobacco mosaic disease and subsequent discovery of its viral nature were instrumental in the establishment of the general concepts of virology.

== Structure ==
&quot;Tobacco mosaic virus&quot; has a rod-like appearance. Its capsid is made from 2130 molecules of coat protein and one molecule of genomic single strand RNA, 6400 bases long. The coat protein self-assembles into the rod-like helical structure (16.3 proteins per helix turn) around the RNA, which forms a hairpin loop structure (see the electron micrograph above). The structural organization of the virus gives stability. The protein monomer consists of 158 amino acids which are assembled into four main alpha-helices, which are joined by a prominent loop proximal to the axis of the virion. Virions are ~300 nm in length and ~18 nm in diameter. Negatively stained electron microphotographs show a distinct inner channel of radius ~2 nm. The RNA is located at a radius of ~4 nm and is protected from the action of cellular enzymes by the coat protein. X-ray fiber diffraction structure of the intact virus was studied based on an electron density map at 3.6 Å resolution. Inside the capsid helix, near the core, is the coiled RNA molecule, which is made up of 6,395 ±10 nucleotides. The structure of the virus plays an important role in the recognition of the viral DNA. This happens due to the formation of an obligatory intermediate produced from a protein allows the virus to recognize a specific RNA hairpin structure. The intermediate induces the nucleation of TMV self-assembly by binding with the hairpin structure.

== Genome ==

The TMV genome consists of a 6.3–6.5 kbp single-stranded (ss) RNA. The 3’-terminus has a tRNA-like structure, and the 5’-terminus has a methylated nucleotide cap. (m7G5’pppG). The genome encodes 4 open reading frames (ORFs), two of which produce a single protein due to ribosomal readthrough of a leaky UAG stop codon. The 4 genes encode a replicase (with methyltransferase [MT] and RNA helicase [Hel] domains), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a so-called movement protein (MP) and a capsid protein (CP). The coding sequence starts with the first reading frame, which is 69 nucleotides away from the 5&#x27; end of the RNA. The noncoding region at the 5&#x27; end can be varied in different individual virions, but there hasn&#x27;t been any variation found between virions in the noncoding region at the 3&#x27; end.

== Physicochemical properties ==
TMV is a thermostable virus. On a dried leaf, it can withstand up to 50 °C (120 degree Fahrenheit) for 30 minutes.

TMV has an index of refraction of about 1.57.

== Disease cycle ==
TMV does not have a distinct overwintering structure. Rather, it will over-winter in infected tobacco stalks and leaves in the soil, on the surface of contaminated seed (TMV can even survive in contaminated tobacco products for many years, so smokers can accidentally transmit it by touch, although not in the smoke itself). With the direct contact with host plants through its vectors (normally insects such as aphids and leafhoppers), TMV will go through the infection process and then the replication process.

=== Infection and transmission ===
After its multiplication, it enters the neighboring cells through plasmodesmata. The infection does not spread through contact with insects, but instead spreads by direct contact to the neighboring cells. For its smooth entry, TMV produces a 30 kDa movement protein called P30 which enlarges the plasmodesmata. TMV most likely moves from cell-to-cell as a complex of the RNA, P30, and replicate proteins.

It can also spread through phloem for longer distance movement within the plant. Moreover, TMV can be transmitted from one plant to another by direct contact. Although TMV does not have defined transmission vectors, the virus can be easily transmitted from the infected hosts to the healthy plants by human handling.

=== Replication ===
Following entry into its host via mechanical inoculation, TMV uncoats itself to release its viral [+]RNA strand. As uncoating occurs, the MetHel:Pol gene is translated to make the capping enzyme MetHel and the RNA Polymerase. Then the viral genome will further replicate to produce multiple mRNAs via a [-]RNA intermediate primed by the tRNAHIS at the [+]RNA 3&#x27; end. The resulting mRNAs encode several proteins, including the coat protein and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), as well as the movement protein. Thus TMV can replicate its own genome.

After the coat protein and RNA genome of TMV have been synthesized, they spontaneously assemble into complete TMV virions in a highly organized process. The protomers come together to form disks or &#x27;lockwashers&#x27; composed of two layers of protomers arranged in a helix. The helical capsid grows by the addition of protomers to the end of the rod. As the rod lengthens, the RNA passes through a channel in its center and forms a loop at the growing end. In this way the RNA can easily fit as a spiral into the interior of the helical capsid.

== Host and symptoms ==
Like other plant pathogenic viruses, TMV has a very wide host range and has different effects depending on the host being infected. &quot;Tobacco mosaic virus&quot; has been known to cause a production loss for flue cured tobacco of up to two percent in North Carolina. It is known to infect members of nine plant families, and at least 125 individual species, including tobacco, tomato, pepper (all members of the Solanaceae), cucumbers, a number of ornamental flowers, and beans including &quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot; and &quot;Vigna unguiculata&quot;. There are many different strains. The first symptom of this virus disease is a light green coloration between the veins of young leaves. This is followed quickly by the development of a &quot;mosaic&quot; or mottled pattern of light and dark green areas in the leaves. Rugosity may also be seen where the infected plant leaves display small localized random wrinkles. These symptoms develop quickly and are more pronounced on younger leaves. Its infection does not result in plant death, but if infection occurs early in the season, plants are stunted. Lower leaves are subjected to &quot;mosaic burn&quot; especially during periods of hot and dry weather. In these cases, large dead areas develop in the leaves. This constitutes one of the most destructive phases of &quot;Tobacco mosaic virus&quot; infection. Infected leaves may be crinkled, puckered, or elongated. However, if TMV infects crops like grape and apple, it is almost symptomless. TMV is able to infect and complete its replication cycle in a plant pathogenic fungus, TMV is able to enter and replicate in cells of C. acutatum, C. clavatum, and C. theobromicola, which may not be an exception, although it has neither been found nor probably searched for in nature.

== Environment ==
TMV is one of the most stable viruses and has a wide survival range. As long as the surrounding temperature remains below approximately 40 degrees Celsius, TMV can sustain its stable form. All it needs is a host to infect. If necessary, greenhouses and botanical gardens would provide the most favorable condition for TMV to spread out, due to the high population density of possible hosts and the constant temperature throughout the year. It also could be useful to culture TMV in vitro in sap because it can survive up to 3000 days.

== Treatment and management ==
One of the common control methods for TMV is sanitation, which includes removing infected plants and washing hands in between each planting. Crop rotation should also be employed to avoid infected soil/seed beds for at least two years. As for any plant disease, looking for resistant strains against TMV may also be advised. Furthermore, the cross protection method can be administered, where the stronger strain of TMV infection is inhibited by infecting the host plant with a mild strain of TMV, similar to the effect of a vaccine.

In the past ten years, the application of genetic engineering on a host plant genome has been developed to allow the host plant to produce the TMV coat protein within their cells. It was hypothesized that the TMV genome will be re-coated rapidly upon entering the host cell, thus it prevents the initiation of TMV replication. Later it was found that the mechanism that protects the host from viral genome insertion is through gene silencing.

TMV is inhibited by a product of the myxomycete slime mold &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot;. Both tobacco and the beans &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; and &quot;V. sinensis&quot; suffered almost no lesioning &quot;in vitro&quot; from TMV when treated with a &quot;P. polycephalum&quot; extract.

Research has shown that &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp. can be used to reduce the severity of symptoms from TMV in tobacco plants. In the study, treated tobacco plants had more growth and less build-up of TMV virions than tobacco plants that hadn&#x27;t been treated.

A research has been conducted by H.Fraenkel-Conrat to show the influence of acetic acid on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus. According to the research, 67% acetic acid resulted as degradation of the virus.

Another possible source of prevention for TMV is the use of salicylic acid. A study completed by a research team at the University of Cambridge found that treating plants with salicylic acid reduced the amount of TMV viral RNAs and viral coat protein present in the tobacco plants. Their research showed that salicylic acid most likely was disrupting replication and transcription and more specifically, the RdRp complex.

A research was conducted and revealed that humans have antibodies against Tobacco Mosaic Virus.

== Scientific and environmental impact ==
The large amount of literature about TMV and its choice for many pioneering investigations in structural biology (including X-ray diffraction and X-ray crystallography), virus assembly and disassembly, and so on, are fundamentally due to the large quantities that can be obtained, plus the fact that it does not infect animals. After growing several hundred infected tobacco plants in a greenhouse, followed by a few simple laboratory procedures, a scientist can produce several grams of the virus. In fact, tobacco mosaic virus is so proliferate that the inclusion bodies can be seen with only a light microscope.

James D. Watson, in his memoir &quot;The Double Helix&quot;, cites his x-ray investigation of TMV&#x27;s helical structure as an important step in deducing the nature of the DNA molecule.

== Applications ==
Plant viruses can be used to engineer viral vectors, tools commonly used by molecular biologists to deliver genetic material into plant cells; they are also sources of biomaterials and nanotechnology devices. Viral vectors based on TMV include those of the magnICON and TRBO plant expression technologies. Due to its cylindrical shape, high aspect ratio, self-assembling nature, and ability to incorporate metal coatings (nickel and cobalt) into its shell, TMV is an ideal candidate to be incorporated into battery electrodes. Addition of TMV to a battery electrode increases the reactive surface area by an order of magnitude, resulting in an increase in the battery&#x27;s capacity by up to six times compared to a planar electrode geometry. The TMV-based vector also enabled C. acutatum to transiently express exogenous GFP up to six subcultures and for at least 2 mo after infection, without the need to develop transformation technology, RNAi can be expressed in the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum acutatum by VIGS using a recombinant vector based on TMV in which the ORF of the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was transcribed in fungal cells from a duplicate of the TMV coat protein (CP) subgenomic mRNA promoter and demonstrated that the approach could be used to obtain foreign protein expression in fungi.

<doc id="164224" wikidata="Q3308314" url="?curid=164224" title="Michael Landy">
<text>Michael Landy (born 1963) is one of the Young British Artists (YBAs). He is best known for the performance piece installation &quot;Break Down&quot; (2001), in which he destroyed all his possessions, and for the Art Bin project (2010) at the South London Gallery. On 29 May 2008, Landy was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in London.

==Early life and works==

Landy was born in London. He first studied art in Loughton and Loughborough, then at Goldsmiths College in London, having been inspired to take up art professionally after having a picture selected for display on the BBC television art program Take Hart.

After graduating from Goldsmiths in 1988, he exhibited in the &quot;Freeze&quot; exhibition, organised by Damien Hirst—an exhibition which first brought together a group of artists that would later become known as the Young British Artists.

In 1990, Landy exhibited in East Country Yard with several of the artists from &quot;Freeze&quot;. His first solo exhibition was &quot;Market&quot; (1990), an installation comprising numerous empty market stalls. Like much of his later work it was intended as a comment on consumerism and society.

In 1992, Landy started an association with Karsten Schubert by making &quot;Closing Down Sale&quot; for his gallery, an installation made up of a number of objects in shopping trolleys labelled &quot;BARGAIN&quot; and recorded announcements encouraging visitors to buy. The work was intended as a comment on the commodification of art, and might be seen as a precursor of sorts to &quot;Break Down&quot;, a work which produced no salable objects, except an edition of inventories (books) listing all destroyed items.

Before &quot;Break Down&quot;, Landy&#x27;s best-known work was &quot;Scrapheap Services&quot; (1995–1996), which featured a fictitious cleaning company which sought to change society by way of &quot;a minority of people being discarded&quot;. Promotional videos were made for the company and a large number of cut-out men were made from old magazines to be swept up and destroyed. This installation typifies the YBAs&#x27; interests in transforming the mundane into art, and recontextualisation. Its visual impact on one level is a typical industrial event, yet the gallery environment and bright red figures, along with the sinister irony of the title, is intended to force the viewer to address issues of humanity and consumerism.
In 1997, work which Landy had previously sold to Charles Saatchi was included in the Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy in London. This show later toured Berlin and New York, but Landy&#x27;s work was somewhat overshadowed by some of the other more outrageous artworks.

==&quot;Break Down&quot;==

&quot;Break Down&quot;, the work which put him in the public eye, was held in February 2001 at an old branch of the clothes store C&amp;A on Oxford Street in London (C&amp;A had recently ceased trading, and the shop had been emptied). Landy gathered together all his possessions, ranging from postage stamps to his car, and including all his clothes and works of art by himself and others, painstakingly catalogued all 7,227 of them in detail, and then destroyed all in public. The process of destruction was done on something resembling an assembly line in a mass production factory, with ten workers reducing each item to its basic materials and then shredding them.

The exhibition was a joint commission from &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper and Artangel, and attracted around 45,000 visitors. At the end of the process all that was left was bags of rubbish, none of which was sold or exhibited in any form. An edition of inventory books listing all destroyed items was available to buy when exiting through the gift shop.

Landy made no money as a direct result of &quot;Break Down&quot;, and following it had no possessions at all.

==Later works==
Landy made little art in the year following &quot;Break Down&quot; before returning with a solo show in late 2002, entitled &quot;Nourishment&quot;. The exhibition consisted of a series of detailed etchings of weeds, rendered in the traditional style of botanical draughtsmanship. The intricate detailing is reported to have resulted in lasting eye damage for Landy.

In 2003, Landy was selected to chair the judging panel for the Beck&#x27;s Futures art prize.

In 2008, Ridinghouse published &quot;Michael Landy: Everything Must Go!&quot;, Landy&#x27;s first monograph, which brings together over 20 years of the artist&#x27;s work for the first time. It was in this year that Landy was elected a member of the Royal Academy.

Landy&#x27;s &quot;Art Bin&quot; installation for the South London Gallery in February–March 2010 was described by the artist as &quot;a monument to creative failure.&quot; A large transparent skip was installed at the gallery, into which he invited the public to throw art work with which they were dissatisfied. Artists and collectors were invited to apply to dispose of works of art via a dedicated website.

In 2016, Museum Tinguely Basel curated Landy&#x27;s first retrospective exhibition titled &quot;Michael Landy. Out of Order&quot;. It spanned his entire career, bringing together works from &quot;Break Down&quot;, &quot;Credit Card Destroying Machine&quot;, and &quot;Saints Alive&quot; among many others. 

==Personal life==
Landy&#x27;s partner is fellow British artist Gillian Wearing.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to art.

<doc id="164225" wikidata="Q877834" url="?curid=164225" title="Japanese name">
<text>in modern times consist of a family name (surname) followed by a given name. Japanese names are usually written in kanji, where the pronunciation follows a special set of rules. Because parents when naming children, and foreigners when adopting a Japanese name, are able to choose which pronunciations they want for certain kanji, the same written form of a name may have multiple readings. In exceptional cases, this makes it impossible to determine the intended pronunciation of a name with certainty. Even so, most pronunciations chosen for names are common, making them easier to read. While any jōyō kanji (with some exceptions for readability) and may be used as part of a name, names may be rejected if they are believed to fall outside what would be considered an acceptable name by measures of common sense.

Japanese names may be written in hiragana or katakana, the Japanese language syllabaries for words of Japanese or foreign origin, respectively. As such, names written in hiragana or katakana are phonetic rendering and lack meanings that are expressed by names written in the logographic kanji.

==Structure==
The majority of Japanese people have one surname and one given name, except for the Japanese imperial family, whose members have no surname. The family name precedes the given name. People with mixed Japanese and foreign parentage may have middle names.

Very few names are in use both as surnames and as given names (for example , , , or ). Therefore, to those familiar with Japanese names, which name is the surname and which is the given name is usually apparent, no matter in which order the names are presented. It is thus unlikely that the two names will be confused, for example, when writing in English while using the family name-given name naming order. However, due to the variety of pronunciations and differences in languages, some common surnames and given names may coincide when Romanized: e.g., (given name) and (surname).

===Family names===
The term &quot;surname&quot; or &quot;family name&quot; can translate into three different Japanese words, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;, which historically had different meanings. &#x27; was originally the patrilineal surname which was granted by the emperor as a title of male rank. In the 8th century, eight types of were established, but later all surnames except for &#x27; almost disappeared. &#x27; was another name used to designate patrilineal clan. &quot;Uji&quot; and &quot;Sei&quot; used in the set: e.g., , , . &quot;Uji&quot; and together are called &quot;&quot; and also simply . There were relatively few of the medieval noble clans, and they trace their lineage either directly to these or to the courtiers of these . was simply what a family chooses to call itself, as opposed to the granted by the emperor. While it was passed on patrilineally in male ancestors including in male ancestors called (uncles), one had a certain degree of freedom in changing one&#x27;s . See also .

According to estimates, there are over 300,000 different surnames in use today in Japan. The three most common family names in Japan are , , and . People in Japan began using surnames during the Muromachi period. Japanese peasants had surnames in the Edo period; however, they could not use them in public.

Most surnames are written with two kanji characters, but some common surnames are written with one or three kanji. Some surnames written with four or five kanji exist, such as , but these are rare.

One large category of family names can be categorized as names. The kanji , meaning &quot;wisteria&quot;, has the (or, with , ). Many Japanese people have surnames that include this kanji as the second character. This is because the gave their samurai surnames () ending with the first character of their name (which can be pronounced either or ), to denote their status in an era when commoners were not allowed surnames. Examples include Atō, Andō, Itō (although a different final kanji is also common), Udō, Etō, Endō, Gotō, Jitō, Katō, Kitō, Kudō, Kondō, Saitō, Satō, Shindō, Sudō, Naitō, Bitō, and Mutō. As already noted, some of the most common family names are in this list.

Japanese family names usually include characters referring to places and geographic features.

===Given names===
Given names are called the or , because, in vertically written Japanese, the given name appears under the family name.

While family names follow relatively consistent rules, given names are much more diverse in pronunciation and characters. While many common names can easily be spelled or pronounced, parents may choose names with unusual characters or pronunciations; the pronunciation of such names generally cannot be inferred from the written form, or vice versa. Unusual pronunciations have become much more common, as the trend has significantly increased in popularity since the 1990s. For example, the popular masculine name is traditionally pronounced &quot;Hiroto&quot;, but in recent years alternative pronunciations &quot;Haruto&quot;, &quot;Yamato&quot;, &quot;Taiga&quot;, &quot;Sora&quot;, &quot;Taito&quot;, &quot;Daito&quot;, and &quot;Masato&quot; have all entered use.

Male names often end in (e.g. &quot;Ichirō&quot;), (e.g. &quot;Kenta&quot;), or (e.g. &quot;Teruo&quot; or &quot;Akio&quot;). Male names often also contain (e.g. &quot;Ken&#x27;ichi&quot;), (also written with , along with several other possible characters; e.g. &quot;Kazuhiro&quot;), (e.g. &quot;Jirō&quot;), or (e.g. &quot;Daichi&quot;).

Female names often end in (e.g. &quot;Keiko&quot;) or (e.g. &quot;Yumi&quot;). Other popular endings for female names include (e.g. &quot;Reika&quot;) and (e.g. &quot;Haruna&quot;).

Most personal names use one, two, or three kanji. Four-syllable given names are common, especially in eldest sons.

The usage of has changed significantly over the years: prior to the Meiji Restoration (1868), it was reserved for members of the imperial family. Following the restoration, it became popular and was overwhelmingly common in the Taishō and early Shōwa era. The suffix increased in popularity after the mid-20th century.

Around the year 2006, due to the citizenry mimicking naming habits of popular entertainers, the suffix was declining in popularity. At the same time, names of western origin, written in kana, were becoming increasingly popular for naming of girls. By 2004 there was a trend of using hiragana instead of kanji in naming girls.

Molly Hakes said that this may have to do with using hiragana out of cultural pride, since hiragana is Japan&#x27;s indigenous writing form, or out of not assigning a meaning to a girl&#x27;s name so that others do not have a particular expectation of her.

Names ending with dropped significantly in popularity in the mid-1980s, but are still given, though much less than in the past. Male names occasionally end with the syllable as in Mako, but very rarely using the kanji (most often, if a male name ends in , it ends in , using the kanji meaning &quot;boy&quot;). Common male name endings are and ; names ending with are often adjectives, e.g., Atsushi, which might mean, for example, &quot;(to be) faithful.&quot;

Katakana and hiragana spellings are characteristic of feminine names rather than masculine names, with katakana often used for women&#x27;s names in the early 20th century due to being easier to read and write.

A single name-forming element, such as can be written by more than one kanji (, , or ). Conversely, a particular kanji can have multiple meanings and pronunciations. In some names, Japanese characters phonetically &quot;spell&quot; a name and have no intended meaning behind them. Many Japanese personal names use puns.

Although usually written in kanji, Japanese names have distinct differences from Chinese names through the selection of characters in a name and the pronunciation of them. A Japanese person can distinguish a Japanese name from a Chinese name. Akie Tomozawa said that this was equivalent to how &quot;Europeans can easily tell that the name &#x27;Smith&#x27; is English and &#x27;Schmidt&#x27; is German or that &#x27;Victor&#x27; is English or French and &#x27;Vittorio&#x27; is Italian&quot;.

==Characters==
Japanese names are usually written in kanji, although some names use hiragana or even katakana, or a mixture of kanji and kana. While most &quot;traditional&quot; names use (native Japanese) kanji readings, a large number of given names and surnames use (Japanese sound, often Chinese-based) kanji readings as well. Many others use readings which are only used in names (), such as the female name .

The sound , indicating possession (like the Saxon genitive in English), and corresponding to the character , is often included in names but not written as a separate character, as in the common name , or historical figures such as Sen no Rikyū.

===Difficulty of reading names===

A name written in kanji may have more than one common pronunciation, only one of which is correct for a given individual. For example, the surname written in kanji as may be read either or . Conversely, any one name may have several possible written forms, and again, only one will be correct for a given individual. The character when used as a male given name may be used as the written form for &quot;Hajime&quot;, &quot;Hitoshi&quot;, &quot;Ichi-/-ichi&quot; &quot;Kazu-/-kazu&quot;, and many others. The name Hajime may be written with any of the following: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , or . This many-to-many correspondence between names and the ways they are written is much more common with male given names than with surnames or female given names but can be observed in all these categories. The permutations of potential characters and sounds can become enormous, as some very overloaded sounds may be produced by over 500 distinct kanji and some kanji characters can stand for several dozen sounds. This can and does make the collation, pronunciation, and romanization of a Japanese name a very difficult problem. For this reason, business cards often include the pronunciation of the name as furigana, and forms and documents often include spaces to write the reading of the name in kana (usually katakana).

A few Japanese names, particularly family names, include archaic versions of characters. For example, the very common character , &quot;island&quot;, may be written as or instead of the usual . Some names also feature very uncommon kanji, or even kanji which no longer exist in modern Japanese. Japanese people who have such names are likely to compromise by substituting similar or simplified characters. This may be difficult for input of kanji in computers, as many kanji databases on computers only include common and regularly used kanji, and many archaic or mostly unused characters are not included.

An example of such a name is Saitō: there are two common kanji for here. The two characters have different meanings: means &quot;together&quot; or &quot;parallel&quot;, but means &quot;to purify&quot;. These names can also exist written in archaic forms, as and respectively.

A problem occurs when an elderly person forgets how to write their name in old kanji that is no longer used.

Family names are sometimes written with periphrastic readings, called , in which the written characters relate indirectly to the name as spoken. For example, would normally be read as , but as a family name it is read , because the first day of the fourth lunar month (in the old lunar calendar, closer to 1 May) is the traditional date to switch from winter to summer clothes. In the same way would normally be read as or , but is read , because little birds () play () where there are no () hawks ().

Most Japanese people and agencies have adopted customs to deal with these issues. Address books, for instance, often contain furigana or ruby characters to clarify the pronunciation of the name. Japanese nationals are also required to give a romanized name for their passport.

Not all names are complicated. Some common names are summarized by the phrase : the three kanji (, and ), together in any pair, form a simple, reasonably common surname: Tanaka, Nakamura, Murata, Nakata (Nakada), Muranaka, Tamura.

Despite these difficulties, there are enough patterns and recurring names that most native Japanese will be able to read virtually all family names they encounter and the majority of personal names.

===Regulations===

Kanji names in Japan are governed by the Japanese Ministry of Justice&#x27;s rules on kanji use in names. , only the 843 &quot;name kanji&quot; () and 2,136 &quot;commonly used characters&quot; () are permitted for use in personal names. This is intended to ensure that names can be readily written and read by those literate in Japanese. Names may be rejected if they are considered unacceptable; for example, in 1993 two parents who tried to name their child , which means &quot;devil&quot;, were prohibited from doing so after a massive public outcry.

Though there are regulations on the naming of children, many archaic characters can still be found in adults&#x27; names, particularly those born prior to the Second World War. Because the legal restrictions on use of such kanji cause inconvenience for those with such names and promote a proliferation of identical names, many recent changes have been made to increase rather than to reduce the number of kanji allowed for use in names. The Sapporo High Court held that it was unlawful for the government to deny registration of a child&#x27;s name because it contained a kanji character that was relatively common but not included in the official list of name characters compiled by the Ministry of Justice. Subsequently, the Japanese government promulgated plans to increase the number of kanji &quot;permitted&quot; in names.

The use of a space in given names (to separate first and middle names) is not allowed in official documents, because technically, a space is not an allowed character. However, spaces are sometimes used on business cards and in correspondence.

==Customs==

Historically, families consisted of many children and it was a common practice to name sons by numbers suffixed with . The first son would be known as &quot;Ichirō&quot;, the second as &quot;Jirō&quot;, and so on. Girls were often named with at the end of the given name (this should not be confused with the less common male suffix ). Both practices have become less common, although many children continue to be given names that originate from these conventions.

===Speaking to and of others===
Conventions of direct address and name use in conversation are heavily governed by respect for those considered in higher social positions (ex. older family members, teachers, employers), familiarity with those considered to be in lower social positions (ex. younger family members, students, employees) and the speaker&#x27;s relationships with the listener and the addressee. Typically, the family name is used to refer to an individual, and personal or given names are largely restricted to informal situations and cases where the speaker is older than, a superior of, or very familiar with the named individual. When addressing someone or referring to a member of one&#x27;s out-group, a respectful title such as is typically added. Calling someone&#x27;s name (family name) without any title or honorific is called , and may be considered rude even in the most informal and friendly occasions. This faux pas, however, is readily excused for foreigners.

Japanese people often avoid referring to their seniors or superiors by name at all. Rather, it is considered more respectful to address one who is considered a social superior by their title. Similarly to Western cultures, one would not address their mother by their name, but perhaps as ; however, this readily extends outside the family circle as well. A teacher would be addressed as , while a company president would be addressed as .

Pronouns meaning &quot;you&quot; (, , ) are uncommon in Japanese, as when used improperly they may be perceived as being affrontive or sarcastic. It is more common for people to address each other by name/title and honorific, even in face-to-face conversations.

===Nicknames===

Any given name corresponds with one or more hypocoristics, or affectionate nicknames. These are formed by adding the suffix to a name stem. There are two types of stem: the full given name or a modified stem derived from the full given name. Examples of the first type are Tarō-chan from Tarō, Kimiko-chan from Kimiko, and Yasunari-chan from Yasunari. Examples of the second type are Ta-chan from Tarō, Kii-chan from Kimiko, and Yā-chan from Yasunari. Hypocoristics with modified stems are considered more intimate than those based on the full given name.

Hypocoristics with modified stems are derived by adding to a stem consisting of an integral number, usually one but occasionally two, of feet, where a foot consists of two moras. A is the unit of which a light syllable contains one and a heavy syllable two. For example, the stems that may be derived from Tarō are /taro/, consisting of two light syllables, and /taa/, consisting of a single syllable with a long vowel, resulting in Taro-chan and Tā-chan. The stems that may be derived from Hanako are /hana/, with two light syllables, /han/, with one syllable closed by a consonant, and /haa/, with one syllable with a long vowel, resulting in Hanachan, Hanchan, and Hāchan. The segmental content is usually a left substring of that of the given name. However, in some cases it is obtained by other means, including the use of another reading of the kanji used to write the name. For example, a girl named Megumi may be called Keichan or just Kei, because the character used to write , can also be read .

The common Japanese practice of forming abbreviations by concatenating the first two morae of two words is sometimes applied to names (usually those of celebrities). For example, , a famous Japanese actor and singer, becomes . This is sometimes applied even to non-Japanese celebrities: Brad Pitt, whose full name remains the same in Japanese as is commonly known as , and Jimi Hendrix is abbreviated as . Some Japanese celebrities have also taken names combining kanji and katakana, such as . Another slightly less common method is doubling one or two syllables of the person&#x27;s name, such as the use of &quot;MamiMami&quot; for Mamiko Noto.

== Names from other ethnic groups in Japan ==
Many ethnic minorities living in Japan, mostly Korean and Chinese, adopt Japanese names. The roots of this custom go back to the colonial-era policy of , which forced Koreans to change their names to Japanese names. Nowadays, ethnic minorities, mostly Korean, who immigrated to Japan after WWII take on Japanese names (sometimes called &#x27;pass names&#x27;) to ease communication and, more importantly, to avoid discrimination. A few of them (e.g., Han Chang-Woo, founder and chairman of Maruhan Corp., pronounced &#x27;Kan Shōyū&#x27; in Japanese) still keep their native names. Sometimes, however, ethnic Chinese and Koreans in Japan who choose to renounce Permanent Resident status to apply for Japanese citizenship have to change the characters in their names because not all characters are legally recognized in Japan for naming purposes.

Japanese citizenship used to require adoption of a Japanese name. In recent decades, the government has allowed individuals to simply adopt katakana versions of their native names when applying for citizenship, as is already done when referring to non-East Asian foreigners: National Diet member , originally &#x27;Martti Turunen&#x27;, who is Finnish, is a famous example. Others transliterate their names into phonetically similar kanji compounds, such as activist , an American-Japanese activist known as &#x27;David Aldwinckle&#x27; before taking Japanese citizenship. (Tsurunen has similarly adopted .) Still others have abandoned their native names entirely in favor of Yamato names, such as Lafcadio Hearn (who was half Anglo-Irish and half Greek), who used the name . At the time, to gain Japanese citizenship, it was necessary to be adopted by a Japanese family (in Hearn&#x27;s case, it was his wife&#x27;s family) and take their name.

Individuals born overseas with Western given names and Japanese surnames are usually given a katakana name in Western order ([given name] [surname]) when referred to in Japanese. Eric Shinseki, for instance, is still referred to as &quot;Eric Shinseki&quot; (エリック シンセキ), opting to use the native script in rendering his name. However, sometimes Japanese parents decide to use Japanese order when mentioning the child&#x27;s name in Japanese. Also, Japanese parents tend to give their children a name in kanji, hiragana, or katakana, particularly if it is a Japanese name. Even individuals born in Japan, with a Japanese name, might be referred to using katakana if they have established residency or a career overseas. Yoko Ono, for example, was born in Japan, with the name , and spent the first twenty years of her life there. However, having lived outside the country for more than fifty years, and basing her career in the United States, Ono is often referred to in the press as , preserving the Japanese order of her name (Ono Yōko), but rendering it in katakana. Another example is the inventor of Bitcoin, who has gone under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, and which is most likely a pseudonym, perhaps even of a non-Japanese person; Nakamoto is referred to in Japanese with katakana in Western order, , rather than .

Christians in Japan traditionally have Christian names in addition to their native Japanese names. These Christian names are written using katakana, and are adapted to Japanese phonology from their Portuguese or Latin forms rather than being borrowed from English. Peter, for example, is , John is , Jacob is , Martin is , Dominic is , and so on. For most purposes in real life, Christian names are not used; for example, Taro Aso has a Christian name, , which is not nearly as well-known. 16th century Dom Justo Takayama, on the other hand, is far more well known by his Christian name than his birth name, Hikogorō Shigetomo.

== Imperial names ==
For historical reasons, the Japanese emperor and his families do not have a surname and possess only a given name, such as . However, Japanese people prefer to say &quot;the Emperor&quot; or &quot;the Crown Prince&quot;, rather than using the personal name out of respect and as a measure of politeness.

When children are born into the Imperial family, they receive a standard given name as well as a special title. For instance, the Emperor emeritus Akihito was born . In this name, the title is , and he was referred to as &quot;Prince Tsugu&quot; during his childhood. This title is generally used until the individual becomes heir to the throne or inherits one of the historical princely family names (, , , etc.).

When a member of the Imperial family becomes a noble or a commoner, the emperor gives them a family name. In medieval era, the family name &quot;Minamoto&quot; was often used. In modern era, princely family names are used. For example, many members of the extended Imperial family became commoners after World War II and adopted their princely family names minus the honorific as regular surnames. Conversely, if a commoner or a noble were to become a member of the Imperial family, such as through marriage, their family name is lost. An example is Empress Michiko, whose name was Michiko Shōda before she married Prince Akihito.

== Historical names ==
The current structure (family name + given name) did not materialize until the 1870s, when the Japanese government created the new family registration system.

In feudal Japan, names reflected a person&#x27;s social status, as well as their affiliation with Buddhist, Shintō, feudatory-military, Confucian-scholarly, mercantile, peasant, slave, and imperial orders.

Before feudal times, Japanese clan names figured prominently in history. Names with fall into this category. The Japanese particle can be translated as &#x27;of&#x27;, and is similar in usage to the German aristocratic , although the association is in the opposite order in Japanese, and is not generally explicitly written in this style of name. Thus, was of the clan. , , and are additional examples. These family names were recorded in the . The Ryukyuan ruling class used names composed of Chinese characters, usually of one or two syllables and read in their own languages, like Korean and Chinese names.

Before the government formalized the naming system in 1868, Japanese personal names were fluid. Men changed their names for a variety of reasons: to signify that they had attained a higher social status, to demonstrate their allegiance to a house or clan, to show that they had succeeded to the headship of a family or company, to shed bad luck that was attached to an inauspicious name, or simply to avoid being mistaken for a neighbor with a similar name. Upper-class men often changed their names upon coming of age (), leaving behind their childhood name (which often ended with ) and taking on an adult name. When nobles and samurai received promotions in rank, they received new names, which might contain a syllable or character from their lord&#x27;s name as a mark of favor.

Changes in women&#x27;s personal names were recorded less often, so they may not have changed their names as frequently as men did, but women who went into service as maids or entertainers frequently changed their names for the duration of their service. During their employment, their temporary names were treated as their legal names. For example, a maid who was involved in legal dealings in Kyoto in 1819–1831 signed legal documents as Sayo during one period of employment and as Mitsu during a later period of employment, but she signed as Iwa, presumably her birth name, when she was between jobs.

At least until the Kamakura Period, women&#x27;s names were often descriptive in nature, while their personal names would rarely be used in public. This was especially proeminent in higher class and Imperial Court. An example is Murasaki Shikibu, whose name &quot;Shikibu&quot; is not the equivalent to a surname, but refers to Shikibu-shō, the Ministry of Ceremonials where Murasaki&#x27;s father was employed. &quot;Murasaki&quot;, an additional name possibly derived from the color violet associated with wisteria, the meaning of the word fuji (an element of her clan name), may have been bestowed on her at court in reference to the name she herself had given to the main female character in &quot;Genji&quot;. Another example is Kenreimon-in, wife and empress to Emperor Takakura. Kenreimon-in, which was not her personal name, refers to her residence, located by the Kenreimon Gate in the Kyoto Imperial Palace.

A Japanese person could go by one of several names, depending on the occasion. For example, the 18th-century author, poet, and artist Iwase Samuru wrote under the name Santō Kyōden and worked as an illustrator under the name Kitao Masanobu. Artists and authors adopted a new name for each medium or form they worked in, whether or not they worked professionally. Some types of artistic names () were referred to by special terminology—for example, or for a haiku poet, and for a poet. Scholars also gave themselves scholarly names, often using the Chinese reading of the characters of their Japanese name. People who entered religious orders adopted religious names.

Death added to the number of a person&#x27;s names. When a person died, their personal name was referred to as an and was no longer used. Instead, the person was referred to by their .

The personal names of Japanese emperors were also referred to as , even if the emperor was alive. Prior to Emperor Jomei, the of the emperors were very long and not used. The number of characters in each name diminished after Jomei&#x27;s reign.

, which is given at (), is used by others and one himself uses his real name to refer to him. are commonly named after places or houses; e.g., Bashō, as in the haiku poet , is named after his house, .

In the late shogunate period, many anti-government activists used several false names to hide their activities from the shogunate. Examples are for , for and for . The famous writer is known to have had as many as 33 names.

==Professional names==
Actors and actresses in Western and Japanese dramatic forms, comedians, sumo wrestlers, Western-style professional wrestlers, and practitioners of traditional crafts often use professional names. Many stage names of television and film actors and actresses are unremarkable, being just like ordinary Japanese personal names, but a few are tongue-in-cheek. For example, chose the name of the aforementioned founder of the Fujiwara family, while the name of sounds like &quot;be careful with fire&quot; (although written differently). Many stand-up comics like the duo Beat Takeshi and Beat Kiyoshi choose a Western name for the act and use their own (or stage) given names. Writers also tend to be clever about their names, for example Edogawa Ranpo which is designed to sound like &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&quot;.

Sumo wrestlers take wrestling names called or . While a can be the wrestler&#x27;s own surname, most upper-division have a different from their surname. A typical consists of two or three kanji, rarely just one or more than three. Often, part of the name comes from the wrestler&#x27;s master, a place name (such as the name of a province, a river, or a sea), the name of a weapon, an item identified with Japanese tradition (like a or ), or a term indicating superiority. Often, indicates a wrestler whose father was also in sumo; in this case, the meaning is &quot;junior&quot;.

Wrestlers can change their , as Takahanada did when he became and then . Another notable example is the wrestler Sentoryu, which means &quot;fighting war dragon&quot; but is also homophonous with St. Louis, his city of origin.

Geisha, and practitioners of traditional crafts and arts such as pottery, the tea ceremony, calligraphy, (tattooing) and (flower arranging) often take professional names, known as . In many cases, these come from the master under whom they studied. For geisha, these names often feature the first part of the name of their &quot;older sister&quot;, and typically all the geisha registered to one share this aspect in their names (such as Ichiume, Ichigiku, Ichiteru, etc.).

Kabuki actors take one of the traditional surnames such as , Bandō or Onoe. Some names are inherited on succession, such as that of the famous kabuki actor through a naming ceremony.

Women working in the red-light districts commonly took names as a form of anonymity. However, high-ranking courtesans could inherit a upon gaining promotion to a higher rank. These names, exclusively the property of the brothel owner, typically carried the prestige of the person who held it previously, and brothel owners commonly chose only those of similar countenance and reputation to inherit them. were written in kanji, and were typically more elaborate than the average woman&#x27;s name of the time, holding meanings taken from poetry, literary history and nature. As they were property of the brothel owner, were rarely passed from one directly down to their apprentice, as holders were chosen for their suitability to the name&#x27;s reputation.

==In English and other Western languages==
In English, the names of living or recently deceased Japanese are generally given surname last and without macrons. Historical figures are given surname first and with macrons, if available.
, when using English and other Western languages, Japanese people usually give their names in an order reversed from the traditional Japanese naming order, with the family name after the given name, instead of the given name after the family name. Beginning in Meiji period Japan, in many English-language publications, the naming order of modern-day Japanese people was reversed into the family name last order. The adoption of a Western naming order by Japanese people when writing or speaking in European languages, and when attending Western style or international events such as balls, formed part of the wider Meiji period adoption of aspects of Western culture in efforts to present Japan as a country as developed and advanced as its global neighbours.

Japanese people often have nicknames that are shortened forms of their actual names, and sometimes use these names with foreigners for ease of understanding. For instance, a man named &quot;Kazuyuki&quot; may call himself &quot;Kaz&quot; in the presence of those for whom Japanese is not a first language. Some Japanese people living abroad also adopt nicknames that they use with friends who are not Japanese.
Most foreign publications reverse the names of modern Japanese people, and most Japanese people reverse their own names for materials or publications intended for foreign consumption; for example, a Japanese business executive or official usually has two business cards (), the first presenting their name in the Japanese order for Japanese people, and the second presenting their name in the Western order, intended for foreigners. In popular journalism publications, the Western order of naming is used. These practices stand in stark contrast to how English and generally Western names are treated in the Japanese language, where they are typically presented without reordering.

In Russian, Russian names may be written with family name first and given name second, as well as the other way round, and this applies to Japanese names presented in Russian as well.

In English, many historical figures are still referred to with the family name first. This is especially the case in scholarly works about Japan. Many scholarly works use the Japanese order with Japanese names in general, and a scholarly work is more likely to use Japanese order if the author specialises in subjects related to or about Japan. John Power wrote that &quot;People who can speak and read Japanese have a strong resistance to switching Japanese names to the Western order.&quot; Books written by these authors often have notes stating that Japanese names are in the original order. Some books, however, do not have consistent naming order practices. Shizuka Saeki of &quot;Look Japan&quot; said, &quot;This is not only a headache for writers and translators, it is also a source of confusion for readers.&quot; Lynne E. Riggs of the Society of Writers, Editors and Translators (SWET), a professional writing organization headquartered in Tokyo, wrote that &quot;When you publish a book about Japan, you are publishing it for people who want to know about Japan. So they are interested in learning something new or something as it is supposed to be.&quot;

Edith Terry wrote that because Japanese people are &quot;mastering&quot; a &quot;Western game&quot;, people have some pride and at the same time feel insecurity because the &quot;game&quot; is on &quot;Western terms&quot; rather than &quot;Japanese terms.&quot; The standard presentation of Japanese names in English differs from the standard presentations of modern Chinese names and Korean names, which are usually not reversed to fit the Western order in English, except when the person is living or traveling abroad. Power wrote that the difference between the treatment of Japanese names and of Chinese and Korean names often results in confusion. Terry wrote, &quot;it was one of the ironies of the late twentieth century that Japan remained stranded in the formal devices underlining its historical quest for equality with the West, while China set its own terms, in language as in big-power politics.&quot;

Saeki wrote in 2001 that most Japanese people writing in English use the Western naming order, but that some figures had begun to promote the use of Japanese order as Japan became a major economic power in the 20th century. The &quot;Japan Style Sheet&quot;, a 1998 guide for producing English language works about Japan written by SWET, advocates the use of the Japanese naming order as often as possible, in order to promote a consistency in naming order. In 1987, one publisher of English language textbooks in Japan used the Japanese order of naming, while in 2001 six of the eight publishers of English language textbooks in Japan used the Japanese order. In December 2000, the council on the National Language of the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture recommended that English language productions begin using the Japanese naming order, as &quot;it is in general desirable that personal names be presented and written in a way that preserves their unique forms, except for registries and other documents with specific standards.&quot; It recommended using capitalization (YAMADA Taro) or commas (Yamada, Taro) to clarify which part of the personal name is the family name and which part is the given name. In a January 2000 opinion poll from the Agency for Cultural Affairs on the preferred order of Japanese names in the English language, 34.9% had a preference for Japanese order, 30.6% had a preference for Western order, and 29.6% had no preference. In 1986, the Japan Foundation decided that it would use the Japanese naming order in all of its publications. A Japan Foundation publishing division spokesperson stated around 2001 that some SWET publications, including popular anglophone newspapers, continue to use the Western order. As of 2001, the agency&#x27;s style sheet recommends using a different naming order style depending upon the context. For instance, it advocates using the Western order in publications for readers who are not familiar with Japan, such as international conference papers.

The &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot; recommends indexing Japanese names according to the way the original text treats the name. If the text uses the Western order, the Japanese name is reinverted and indexed by the family name with a comma. If the text uses Japanese order, the name is listed by the family name with no inversion and no comma.

On 21 May 2019, Japanese Foreign Minister Tarō Kōno expressed his hope that foreign media would refer to then-Prime Minister Shinzō Abe in the Japanese custom: family name first (as &quot;Abe Shinzō&quot;). He added that he was currently planning to issue an official request to the international media in that respect. He had criticized Western publications who had not done so, stating that &quot;If you can write Moon Jae-in and Xi Jinping in correct order, you can surely write Abe Shinzo the same way.&quot; At the time, there were private Japanese journalism concerns and journalism concerns of other East Asian countries which continued to reverse Japanese names into Western order in European languages. Shannon Tiezzi of &quot;The Diplomat&quot; stated that the continued usage of Western order was &quot;merely the inertia of style guides everywhere&quot; instead of &quot;a case of cultural arrogance on the part of Westerners&quot;. Some others in the government support moving to retaining the original order of names, in line with Chinese and Korean practice, in time for the several major global events the country will be host to during 2020, while others seem not to. In 2019 Yoshihide Suga continued to use Western order, citing &quot;long-held practice&quot;.

On September 6, 2019, officials from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) announced that the ministry was to start using the traditional order for Japanese names in English in official documents. In 2020, &quot;The Economist&quot; announced plans to begin writing Japanese names in Japanese order based on a Japanese government decree that had been issued. &quot;The Diplomat&quot; began using eastern order for persons in the Japanese government while, for non-government individuals, using the naming orders they choose. NHK World-Japan began using Japanese names surname-first (with some exceptions) as early as March 29, 2020, but the new policy regarding name order was only announced early the next day. In Olympic and Asiad events, starting with the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japanese athletes have had their names rendered surname first.

== In Chinese ==
In Chinese-speaking communities, Japanese names are pronounced according to the Chinese pronunciations of the characters. For example, in Standard Mandarin, becomes Shāntián Tàiláng, while becomes Jiūshān Yóujìfū. As a result, a Japanese person without adequate knowledge of Chinese would not understand their name when it is spoken in Chinese languages. Simply porting the kanji into Chinese and reading them as if they were Chinese is also different from the usual Chinese practice of approximating foreign names with similar-sounding Chinese characters.

Sometimes, a Japanese name includes . These kanji resemble Chinese characters but originate in Japan and do not have widely known Chinese pronunciations. For example, the word , read as in Chinese) is rarely used in modern Chinese reading. When words like this are encountered, usually the rule of &quot;&quot; (&quot;read the side if any, read the middle part if there is no side&quot;) applies. Therefore, &quot;&quot; is read as which is derived from .

Heng Ji wrote that because Japanese names have &quot;flexible&quot; lengths, it may be difficult for someone to identify a Japanese name when reading a Chinese text. When consulting English texts a Chinese reader may have difficulty identifying a Japanese name; an example was when Chinese media mistook Obama&#x27;s pet turkey &quot;Abe&quot; taken from Abe Lincoln (monosyllabic) for Shinzo Abe (disyllabic).

One place where Japanese names may be transliterated into Chinese languages phonetically is in Japanese video games, anime and manga series. In May 2016, Nintendo sparked anger among fans in Hong Kong by announcing that its new &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, would use translations based upon Mandarin across all parts of China and Taiwan. As the variety of Chinese spoken in Hong Kong, Cantonese, has many phonological differences from Mandarin, this results in names of well-known characters such as Pikachu being rendered and pronounced much different from the original Japanese.

<text>A name is a term used for identification by an external observer. They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. The entity identified by a name is called its referent. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a &quot;specific&quot; individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning as well) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called &quot;common names&quot; or (obsolete) &quot;general names&quot;. A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name.

The word &quot;name&quot; comes from Old English &quot;nama&quot;; cognate with Old High German (OHG) &quot;namo&quot;, Sanskrit (&quot;nāman&quot;), Latin &quot;nomen&quot;, Greek (&quot;onoma&quot;), and Persian (&quot;nâm&quot;), from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) &quot;*h₁nómn̥&quot;. Outside Indo-European, it can be connected to Proto-Uralic &quot;*nime&quot;.

== Naming conventions ==
A naming convention is a set of agreed, stipulated, or generally accepted standards, norms, social norms, or criteria for naming things.

Parents may follow a naming convention when selecting names for their children. Some have chosen alphabetical names by birth order. In some East Asian cultures it is common for one syllable in a two-syllable given name to be a generation name which is the same for immediate siblings. In many cultures it is common for the son to be named after the father or a grandfather. In certain African cultures, such as in Cameroon, the eldest son gets the family name for his given name. In other cultures, the name may include the place of residence, or the place of birth.

Major naming conventions include:
* In astronomy, astronomical naming conventions
* In biology, binomial nomenclature
* In chemistry, chemical nomenclature
* In classics, Roman naming conventions
* In computer programming, identifier naming conventions
* In computer networking, computer naming schemes
* In planetary science, planetary nomenclature
* In sciences generally, systematic names for a variety of things

Products may follow a naming convention. Automobiles typically have a binomial name, a &quot;make&quot; (manufacturer) and a &quot;model&quot;, in addition to a model year, such as a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette. Sometimes there is a name for the car&#x27;s &quot;decoration level&quot; or &quot;trim line&quot; as well: e.g., Cadillac Escalade EXT &quot;Platinum&quot;, after the precious metal. Computers often have increasing numbers in their names to signify the next generation.

Courses at schools typically follow a naming convention: an abbreviation for the subject area and then a number ordered by increasing level of difficulty.

Many numbers (e.g., bank accounts, government IDs, credit cards, etc.) are not random but have an internal structure and convention. Virtually all organizations that assign names or numbers will follow some convention in generating these identifiers. Airline flight numbers, Space Shuttle flight numbers, even phone numbers all have an internal convention.

== Personal name ==
A personal name is an identifying word or words by which an individual is intimately known or designated. In many countries, it is traditional for individuals to have a personal name (also called a given name or first name) and a surname (also called a last name or family name because it is shared by members of the same family). Some people have two surnames, one inherited from each parent. In most of Europe and the Americas, the given name typically comes before the surname, whereas in parts of Asia and Hungary the surname comes before the given name (Eastern name order). In some cultures it is traditional for a woman to take her husband&#x27;s surname when she gets married.

A common practice in many countries is patronym which means that a component of a personal name is based on the given name of one&#x27;s father. A less common practice in countries is matronym which means that a component of a personal name is based on the given name of one&#x27;s mother. In some East Asian cultures, it is traditional for given names to include a generation name, a syllable shared between siblings and cousins of the same generation.

Middle names are also used by many people as a third identifier, and can be chosen for personal reasons including signifying relationships, preserving pre-marital/maiden names (a popular practice in the United States), and to perpetuate family names. The practice of using middle names dates back to ancient Rome, where it was common for members of the elite to have a &quot;praenomen&quot; (a personal name), a &quot;nomen&quot; (a family name, not exactly used the way middle names are used today), and a &quot;cognomen&quot; (a name representing an individual attribute or the specific branch of a person&#x27;s family). Middle names eventually fell out of use, but regained popularity in Europe during the nineteenth century.

Besides first, middle, and last names, individuals may also have nicknames, aliases, or titles. Nicknames are informal names used by friends or family to refer to a person (&quot;Chris&quot; may be used as a short form of the personal name &quot;Christopher&quot;). A person may choose to use an alias, or a fake name, instead of their real name, possibly to protect or obscure their identity. People may also have titles designating their role in an institution or profession (members of royal families may use various terms such as king, Queen, duke, or duchess to signify their positions of authority or their relation to the throne).

== Names of names==

In onomastic terminology, personal names of men are called &quot;andronyms&quot; (from Ancient Greek ἀνήρ / man, and ὄνομα / name), while personal names of women are called &quot;gynonyms&quot; (from Ancient Greek γυνή / woman, and ὄνομα / name).

== Brand names ==

Developing a name for a brand or product is heavily influenced by marketing research and strategy to be appealing and marketable. The brand name is often a neologism or pseudoword, such as Kodak or Sony.

== Religious names ==

In the ancient world, particularly in the ancient near-east (Israel, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia) names were thought to be extremely powerful and act, in some ways, as a separate manifestation of a person or deity. This viewpoint is responsible both for the reluctance to use the proper name of God in Hebrew writing or speech, as well as the common understanding in ancient magic that magical rituals had to be carried out &quot;in [someone&#x27;s] name&quot;. By invoking a god or spirit by name, one was thought to be able to summon that spirit&#x27;s power for some kind of miracle or magic (see Luke 9:49, in which the disciples claim to have seen a man driving out demons using the name of Jesus). This understanding passed into later religious tradition, for example the stipulation in Catholic exorcism that the demon cannot be expelled until the exorcist has forced it to give up its name, at which point the name may be used in a stern command which will drive the demon away.

=== Biblical names ===

In the Old Testament, the names of individuals are meaningful, and a change of name indicates a change of status. For example, the patriarch Abram and his wife Sarai were renamed &quot;Abraham&quot; and &quot;Sarah&quot; at the institution of the Abrahamic covenant (Genesis 17:4, 17:15). Simon was renamed Peter when he was given the Keys to Heaven. This is recounted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter 16, which according to Roman Catholic teaching was when Jesus promised to Saint Peter the power to take binding actions. Proper names are &quot;saturated with meaning&quot;.

Throughout the Bible, characters are given names at birth that reflect something of significance or describe the course of their lives. For example: Solomon meant peace, and the king with that name was the first whose reign was without war. Likewise, Joseph named his firstborn son Manasseh (Hebrew: &quot;causing to forget&quot;)(Genesis 41:51); when Joseph also said, &quot;God has made me forget all my troubles and everyone in my father&#x27;s family.&quot; Biblical Jewish people did not have surnames which were passed from generation to generation. However, they were typically known as the child of their father. For example: דוד בן ישי (David ben Yishay) meaning, David, son of Jesse (1 Samuel 17:12,58). Today, this style of name is still used in Jewish religious rites.

===Indian name===

Indian names are based on a variety of systems and naming conventions, which vary from region to region. Names are also influenced by religion and caste and may come from epics. India&#x27;s population speaks a wide variety of languages and nearly every major religion in the world has a following in India. This variety makes for subtle, often confusing, differences in names and naming styles. Due to historical Indian cultural influences, several names across South and Southeast Asia are influenced by or adapted from Indian names or words.

For some Indians, their birth name is different from their official name; the birth name starts with a randomly selected name from the person&#x27;s horoscope (based on the &quot;nakshatra&quot; or lunar mansion corresponding to the person&#x27;s birth).

Many children are given three names, sometimes as a part of religious teaching.

=== Quranic names (Arabic names) ===

We can see many Arabic names in the Quran and in Muslim people, such as Allah, Muhammad, Khwaja, Ismail, Mehboob, Suhelahmed, Shoheb Ameena, Aaisha, Sameena, Rumana, Swaleha, etc. 

The names Mohammed and Ahmed are the same, for example Suhel Ahmad or Mohammad Suhel are the same. There are many similar names in Islam and Christianity, such as Yosef (Islamic)/Joseph (Christian), Adam/Adam, Dawood/David, Rumana/Romana, Maryam/Mary, Nuh/Noah, etc.

==Name use by animals and plants==

The use of personal names is not unique to humans. Dolphins and green-rumped parrotlets also use symbolic names to address contact calls to specific individuals. Individual dolphins have distinctive signature whistles, to which they will respond even when there is no other information to clarify which dolphin is being referred to.
