<text>Tancred or Tankred is a masculine given name of Germanic origin that comes from &quot;thank-&quot; (thought) and &quot;-rath&quot; (counsel), meaning &quot;well-thought advice&quot;. It was used in the High Middle Ages mainly by the Normans (see French Tancrède) and especially associated with the House of Hauteville after the Norman conquest of southern Italy. It is rare today as a first name, but still common as a Norman surname: &quot;Tanqueray&quot;, &quot;Tanquerey&quot;, &quot;Tanqueret&quot;. Its Italian form is Tancredi and in Latin it is Tancredus. Its Italian patronymic is also Tancredi.

<text>A polyalphabetic cipher is a substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The Vigenère cipher is probably the best-known example of a polyalphabetic cipher, though it is a simplified special case. The Enigma machine is more complex but is still fundamentally a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.

==History==
The work of Al-Qalqashandi (1355–1418), based on the earlier work of Ibn al-Durayhim (1312–1359), contained the first published discussion of the substitution and transposition of ciphers, as well as the first description of a polyalphabetic cipher, in which each plaintext letter is assigned more than one substitute. However, it has been claimed that polyalphabetic ciphers may have been developed by the Arab cryptologist Al Kindi (801–873) centuries earlier.

The Alberti cipher by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 was an early polyalphabetic cipher. Alberti used a mixed alphabet to encrypt a message, but whenever he wanted to, he would switch to a different alphabet, indicating that he had done so by including an uppercase letter or a number in the cryptogram. For this encipherment Alberti used a decoder device, his &quot;cipher disk&quot;, which implemented a polyalphabetic substitution with mixed alphabets.

Johannes Trithemius—in his book &quot;Polygraphiae libri sex&quot; (Six books of polygraphia), which was published in 1518 after his death—invented a &quot;progressive key&quot; polyalphabetic cipher called the Trithemius cipher. Unlike Alberti&#x27;s cipher, which switched alphabets at random intervals, Trithemius switched alphabets for each letter of the message. He started with a tabula recta, a square with 26 letters in it (although Trithemius, writing in Latin, used 24 letters). Each alphabet was shifted one letter to the left from the one above it, and started again with A after reaching Z (see table).

Trithemius&#x27;s idea was to encipher the first letter of the message using the first shifted alphabet, so A became B, B became C, etc. The second letter of the message was enciphered using the second shifted alphabet, etc. Alberti&#x27;s cipher disk implemented the same scheme. It had two alphabets, one on a fixed outer ring, and the other on the rotating disk. A letter is enciphered by looking for that letter on the outer ring, and encoding it as the letter underneath it on the disk. The disk started with A underneath B, and the user rotated the disk by one letter after encrypting each letter.

The cipher was trivial to break, and Alberti&#x27;s machine implementation not much more difficult. &quot;Key progression&quot; in both cases was poorly concealed from attackers. Even Alberti&#x27;s implementation of his polyalphabetic cipher was rather easy to break (the capitalized letter is a major clue to the cryptanalyst). For most of the next several hundred years, the significance of using multiple substitution alphabets was missed by almost everyone. Polyalphabetic substitution cipher designers seem to have concentrated on obscuring the choice of a few such alphabets (repeating as needed), not on the increased security possible by using many and never repeating any.

The principle (particularly Alberti&#x27;s unlimited additional substitution alphabets) was a major advance—the most significant in the several hundred years since frequency analysis had been developed. A reasonable implementation would have been (and, when finally achieved, was) vastly harder to break. It was not until the mid-19th century (in Babbage&#x27;s secret work during the Crimean War and Friedrich Kasiski&#x27;s generally equivalent public disclosure some years later) that cryptanalysis of well-implemented polyalphabetic ciphers got anywhere at all. &quot;See&quot; Kasiski examination.

Abramo Colorni described polyalphabetic ciphers in his 1593 work, &quot;Scotographia&quot;.

<doc id="157920" wikidata="Q3482322" url="?curid=157920" title="Ralph d'Escures">
<text>Ralph d&#x27;Escures (also known as Radulf) (died 20 October 1122) was a medieval abbot of Séez, bishop of Rochester, and then archbishop of Canterbury. He studied at the school at the Abbey of Bec. In 1079 he entered the abbey of St Martin at Séez and became abbot there in 1091. He was a friend of both Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury and Bishop Gundulf of Rochester, whose see, or bishopric, he took over on Gundulf&#x27;s death.

Ralph was not chosen archbishop of Canterbury by the chapter of Canterbury alone. His election involved an assembly of the lords and bishops meeting with King Henry I of England. Ralph then received his pallium from Pope Paschal II, rather than travelling to Rome to retrieve it. As archbishop, Ralph was very assertive of the rights of the see of Canterbury and of the liberties of the English church. He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland. Ralph also quarrelled for a time with Pope Paschal II.

Ralph suffered a stroke on 11 July 1119 and was left partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly from that time until his death on 20 October 1122. A surviving English translation of a sermon delivered by Ralph is preserved in a manuscript in the British Library. The sermon survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts.

==Early life==

Ralph was the son of Seffrid d&#x27;Escures and his first wife Rascendis, and a half brother of Seffrid I, Bishop of Chichester from 1125 to 1145. The surname of de Turbine, by which he is sometimes known in older scholarship, is only attested in the fourteenth century and possibly resulted from confusion with William de Corbeil, Ralph&#x27;s successor at Canterbury. Ralph studied at the school at the Abbey of Bec before entering the abbey of St Martin at Séez in 1079. St. Martin was a house founded by the Montgomery and Bellême families, and was still under their lordship. He became abbot of the house in 1091, and his election was attended by Anselm, abbot of Bec.

==Time in England==
Soon afterwards Ralph paid a visit to England, perhaps to visit Shrewsbury Abbey, which was a daughter house of Séez. He may have been involved in the mediating the surrender of Robert of Bellême at Shrewsbury in 1102, for some chroniclers state that it was Ralph who delivered the keys of the castle to King Henry I of England. In 1103, he took refuge in England from the demands of Robert of Bellême for homage. Ralph declined to do homage because Pope Urban II had ordered that no clergy could do homage to the laity. Robert was also demanding heavy taxes, and Ralph fled with Serlo, Bishop of Séez, who was also subjected to Robert&#x27;s demands. He passed his time in England with his friends Saint Anselm and Gundulf the Bishop of Rochester. He attended the translation of Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s remains at Durham, where he was one of examiners of the body, and declared the saint&#x27;s remains uncorrupt. In 1106, he visited Anselm at the Abbey of Bec, but probably did not try to assert himself at Séez. After Anselm was elected to the see of Canterbury, Ralph appears to have become part of the archbishop&#x27;s household.

In June 1108, Ralph succeeded Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester, having been nominated by Gundulf before his death. Ralph was consecrated on 9 August 1108. He was at Anselm&#x27;s deathbed in April 1109, and, afterwards, Ralph acted as administrator of the see of Canterbury until 26 April 1114, when he was chosen Archbishop at Windsor. The king had wanted his doctor, Faricus, who was an Italian and Abbot of Abingdon, but the nobles and the bishops objected to anyone but a Norman being appointed. The bishops also desired someone who was not a monk, or at least not one who was so close to Henry. As a compromise, Ralph was chosen, rather than the secular clergy that the bishops favoured. Although Ralph was a monk and had not served as a royal clerk, he was also a bishop, which seems to have reconciled the other bishops to his selection.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
It is noteworthy that, while Ralph was not chosen by the chapter of Canterbury alone, his election involved an assembly of the magnates and bishops meeting with the king. He was not selected solely by the king, nor solely by the bishops or chapter. Ralph received his pallium from the pope, rather than travelling to Rome to retrieve it. However, It was only with difficulty that Pope Paschal II was persuaded to grant the pallium, as the papacy was attempting to reassert papal jurisdiction over the English Church. It was Anselm of St Saba who brought the pallium to England, along with letters from Paschal complaining that the English Church was translating bishops from see to see without papal permission, that legates from the papacy were being refused entry to England and that the king was allowing no appeals to be made to the pope over ecclesiastical issues. In 1116 the pope even demanded the payment of Peter&#x27;s Pence, a payment direct to the papacy of a penny from every household in England. Ralph, when he took the pallium, professed &quot;fidelity and canonical obedience&quot; to the pope, but did not submit to the papal demands and, in fact, supported King Henry in opposing the pope&#x27;s demands.

As archbishop Ralph championed the rights of the see of Canterbury and the English church. He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland, writing to the pope that &quot;the church of Canterbury has not ceased to provide pastoral care for the whole of Britain and Ireland, both as a benevolence and from its rights of primacy.&quot; He advised the bishop of Llandaff that a new Llandaff Cathedral should be built and granted an indulgence to contributors. He even refused to consecrate Thurstan as Archbishop of York because Thurstan would not profess obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury, part of the Canterbury-York dispute. At first, Ralph depended only on the king to demand Thurstan to submit, but later he appealed to the popes to force Thurstan to obey. His refusal brought him into a dispute with the papacy, for Pope Paschal II supported Thurstan. Ralph visited Rome in 1117, but was unable to obtain an interview with Paschal as the pope had fled the city in front of an invading imperial army. Ralph had taken ill with an ulcer on his face during the trip to Rome and, for a time, it was feared that he would die. He recovered enough to continue on to Rome, however, although it was a fruitless trip. Despite instructions from Paschal&#x27;s successors, Gelasius II and Calixtus II, the archbishop continued to refuse to consecrate Thurstan, and Thurstan was still unconsecrated when Ralph died. Thurstan was eventually consecrated at Rheims by Pope Calixtus II in May 1119, although the issue of primacy remained unresolved.

Although he feuded with York over the primacy, it appears clear that Ralph considered the Investiture Crisis settled in England for, in 1117 while visiting Rome, he took a neutral position as regards the issues between the Pope and the Emperor. In 1115, however, he refused to consecrate Bernard as Bishop of St David&#x27;s in the royal chapel, although Robert of Meulan, the king&#x27;s chief counsellor, advocated that the consecration must take place in the royal chapel according to ancient custom. The king did not insist and Ralph won the confrontation. He was also involved in ecclesiastical affairs in Normandy, as he attended the provincial synod, or Council of Rouen, held in 1118.

==Final years and legacy==
Ralph suffered a stroke on 11 July 1119, as he was removing his vestments after celebrating Mass. From then until his death, Ralph was partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly. He was still involved in decision making and, in 1120, he agreed to King Alexander I of Scotland&#x27;s suggestion that Eadmer become the next Bishop of St Andrew&#x27;s. Ralph was one of the lords consulted about the remarriage of Henry I to Adeliza of Leuven at London in 1121. He also successfully asserted his right to celebrate the king&#x27;s new marriage, over attempts by Roger of Salisbury to officiate instead. Due to the damage from the stroke, Ralph was unable to perform the ceremony but, when Roger made an attempt to do so, Ralph successfully insisted on choosing the officiant and William Giffard the Bishop of Winchester performed the marriage. Ralph died on 20 October 1122, at Canterbury. He was buried in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 23 October 1122. His nephew, John, was a clerk under Ralph, and later Ralph appointed him Archdeacon of Canterbury. After Ralph&#x27;s death, John was elected to the see of Rochester.

Ralph was regarded as a &quot;witty, easygoing&quot; man. The struggle with York, however, along with his illnesses and the effects of the stroke, turned Ralph in his last years into a quarrelsome person. Orderic Vitalis said that he was well educated and well loved by people. Even William of Malmesbury, no lover of ecclesiastics and always ready to find fault with them, could only find fault with him for his occasional lapses into unbecoming frivolity.

Ralph wrote a sermon for the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin and it survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts, probably because it was thought to have been written by Anselm of Canterbury, until shown to be Ralph&#x27;s in 1927. A surviving English translation of the sermon is also preserved in the manuscript British Library, Cotton Vespasian D. xiv. The Latin version, which Ralph was a translation of his originally spoken French version, has been edited and published in 1997. Ralph also had the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury search for documents relating to the privileges of Canterbury and had those documents copied into a manuscript which still survives, BM MS Cotton Cleopatra E. His seal is one of the first to take the usual form for bishop&#x27;s seals, with Ralph standing, in full vestments including a mitre, and performing a benediction with his right hand while holding his crosier in his left. The seal took the form of a pointed oval.

<doc id="157921" wikidata="Q6770782" url="?curid=157921" title="Richard of Dover">
<text>Richard (died 16 February 1184) was a medieval Benedictine monk and Archbishop of Canterbury. Employed by Thomas Becket immediately before Becket&#x27;s death, Richard arranged for Becket to be buried in Canterbury Cathedral and eventually succeeded Becket at Canterbury in a contentious election. Much of Richard&#x27;s time as archbishop was spent in a dispute with Roger de Pont L&#x27;Evêque, the Archbishop of York over the primacy of England, and with St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury over the archbishop&#x27;s jurisdiction over the abbey. Richard had better relations with King Henry II of England than Becket had and was employed by the king on diplomatic affairs. Richard also had the trust of the papacy and served as a judge for it. Several of his questions to Pope Alexander III were collected into the &quot;Decretals&quot;, a collection of ecclesiastical laws, and his patronage of canon lawyers did much to advance the study of canon law in England.

==Early life==

Richard was born in Normandy and became a monk at Canterbury, and a chaplain to Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury. At some point, he received an education, but it is not known where or who he studied with. The first notice of him in history is as a monk at Christ Church. He was a colleague of Thomas Becket while they both worked for Theobald. In 1157, he was appointed prior of St. Martin&#x27;s priory in Dover. St. Martin&#x27;s was a Benedictine priory and a dependent house of Christ Church Cathedral Priory in Canterbury, the cathedral chapter of the archbishops of Canterbury. Right before Becket&#x27;s death Becket employed Richard to meet with Henry the Young King, but was unsuccessful in the attempt. After Becket&#x27;s death, Richard took charge of Becket&#x27;s body and arranged for immediate burial in Canterbury Cathedral.

==Archbishop==
In 1173, more than two years after the murder of Becket, King Henry II of England decided to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury; there were two candidates: Richard, and Odo, prior of Canterbury. Previously, Roger, the abbot of Bec Abbey, had been elected but refused the office. On 3 June 1173, Richard was chosen, although the monks preferred Odo. Both sides appealed to Rome, and Richard journeyed to Rome with Reginald fitz Jocelin, who had recently been elected Bishop of Bath, to rebut the charges of simony, illegitimate birth, and swearing an oath to the king that had been raised. After hearing the charges, they were dismissed, and the election was ratified on 2 April 1174; on 7 April 1174 the new archbishop was consecrated at Anagni by Pope Alexander III. Richard returned to England at the close of the year bearing his pallium which he had received directly from the pope. He was also granted legatine powers by Alexander III.

Richard clashed with Roger de Pont L&#x27;Evêque, the Archbishop of York, over the respective rights of the two sees throughout his time as archbishop. In 1175, at a council held in London, there was a fight between their supporters. King Henry II secured a truce between the archbishops for five years, but Richard was soon embroiled in another dispute. This one was with Roger, abbot of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury, and revolved around whether or not the abbey depended directly on the pope or if the archbishop had jurisdictional rights over the abbey. In the end, the papacy arranged a settlement that left the abbey dependent on the pope direct, but gave the archbishop spiritual authority over the churches of the Isle of Thanet, which the abbey had previously held.

Richard&#x27;s time as archbishop was much less stormy than Becket&#x27;s had been, and he seems to have had better relations with the king. Richard attended the royal councils and was with the king in Normandy more than once. Richard was less dogmatic on the rights of the clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as a sign of weakness. Pope Alexander III took Richard to task when Richard acquiesced in the election of bishops in the royal chapel. As part of his diplomatic efforts on the king&#x27;s behalf, Richard escorted Henry&#x27;s daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. Richard also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.

==Patronage, death and legacy==

Richard attracted canon lawyers to his household, including Gerard la Pucelle, Peter of Blois, and Henry Pium of Northampton, all of whom advised him on legal matters. At the Council of Westminster that Richard convened in May 1175, nineteen canons were put forth, dealing with clerical marriage, the oversupply of ordained clergy, the behaviour of the clergy and their dress and tonsure, and simony. Another canon dealt with clandestine marriages and regulated child marriages. He was also heavily involved with trying judicial cases, both in the actual judgment and in the execution of judgments made by others. Four of his questions to Alexander III entered the &quot;Decretals&quot; and the other collections of canon law of the 13th century.

Richard died at Halling, Kent on 16 February 1184 of colic and was buried in his cathedral. A. L. Poole, the historian, felt that Richard was a &quot;feeble and ineffective person.&quot; Frank Barlow, another historian, calls him a &quot;blameless mediocrity&quot;. Richard of Ilchester, a fellow bishop, held that it was Richard of Dover&#x27;s defects that prevented the English Church from profiting more from Becket&#x27;s martyrdom. However, Richard did much to promote the use of canon law throughout England. Richard was also active in using his legatine powers to interfere in monastic affairs, deposing the abbot of Peterborough Abbey in 1175 and threatening to visit other monastic houses that were exempt from episcopal interference to regulate the monastic affairs. On a more domestic note, Richard was held to have been an able steward of the estates of Canterbury, very much interested in increasing production. He was held to be a pious and gentle man.

<doc id="157923" wikidata="Q3708937" url="?curid=157923" title="Tabula recta">
<text>In cryptography, the tabula recta (from Latin &quot; &quot;) is a square table of alphabets, each row of which is made by shifting the previous one to the left. The term was invented by the German author and monk Johannes Trithemius in 1508, and used in his Trithemius cipher.

== Trithemius cipher ==
The Trithemius cipher was published by Johannes Trithemius in his book &quot;Polygraphia&quot;, which is credited with being the first published printed work on cryptology.

Trithemius used the &quot;tabula recta&quot; to define a polyalphabetic cipher, which was equivalent to Leon Battista Alberti&#x27;s cipher disk except that the order of the letters in the target alphabet is not mixed. The &quot;tabula recta&quot; is often referred to in discussing pre-computer ciphers, including the Vigenère cipher and Blaise de Vigenère&#x27;s less well-known autokey cipher. All polyalphabetic ciphers based on the Caesar cipher can be described in terms of the &quot;tabula recta&quot;.

The tabula recta uses a letter square with the 26 letters of the alphabet followed by 26 rows of additional letters, each shifted once to the left from the one above it. This, in essence, creates 26 different Caesar ciphers.

The resulting ciphertext appears as a random string or block of data. Due to the variable shifting, natural letter frequencies are hidden. However, if a codebreaker is aware that this method has been used, it becomes easy to break. The cipher is vulnerable to attack because it lacks a key, thus violating Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle of cryptology.

=== Improvements ===
In 1553, an important extension to Trithemius&#x27;s method was developed by Giovan Battista Bellaso, now called the Vigenère cipher. Bellaso added a key, which is used to dictate the switching of cipher alphabets with each letter. This method was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère, who published a similar autokey cipher in 1586.

The classic Trithemius cipher (using a shift of one) is equivalent to a Vigenère cipher with ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ as the key. It is also equivalent to a Caesar cipher in which the shift is increased by 1 with each letter, starting at 0.

== Usage ==
Within the body of the tabula recta, each alphabet is shifted one letter to the left from the one above it. This forms 26 rows of shifted alphabets, ending with an alphabet starting with Z (as shown in image). Separate from these 26 alphabets are a header row at the top and a header column on the left, each containing the letters of the alphabet in A-Z order.

The tabula recta can be used in several equivalent ways to encrypt and decrypt text. Most commonly, the left-side header column is used for the plaintext letters, both with encryption and decryption. That usage will be described herein. In order to decrypt a Trithemius cipher, one first locates in the tabula recta the letters to decrypt: first letter in the first interior column, second letter in the second column, etc.; the letter directly to the far left, in the header column, is the corresponding decrypted plaintext letter. Assuming a standard shift of 1 with no key used, the encrypted text HFNOS would be decrypted to HELLO (H-&gt;H, F-&gt;E, N-&gt;L, O-&gt;L, S-&gt;O ). So, for example, to decrypt the second letter of this text, first find the F within the second interior column, then move directly to the left, all the way to the leftmost header column, to find the corresponding plaintext letter: E.

Data is encrypted in the opposite fashion, by first locating each plaintext letter of the message in the leftmost header column of the tabula recta, and mapping it to the appropriate corresponding letter in the interior columns. For example, the first letter of the message is found within the left header column, and then mapped to the letter directly across in the column headed by &quot;A&quot;. The next letter is then mapped to the corresponding letter in the column headed by &quot;B&quot;, and this continues until the entire message is encrypted. If the Trithemius cipher is thought of as having the key ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ, the encryption process can also be conceptualized as finding, for each letter, the intersection of the row containing the letter to be encrypted with the column corresponding to the current letter of the key. The letter where this row and column cross is the ciphertext letter.

Programmatically, the cipher is computable, assigning formula_1, then the encryption process is formula_2. Decryption follows the same process, exchanging ciphertext and plaintext. may be defined as the value of a letter from a companion ciphertext in a running key cipher, a constant for a Caesar cipher, or a zero-based counter with some period in Trithemius&#x27;s usage.

<text>William Courtenay ( 134231 July 1396) was Archbishop of Canterbury (1381–1396), having previously been Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London.

==Early life and education==
Courtenay was a younger son of Hugh de Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon (died 1377), and his wife Margaret, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and granddaughter of Edward I. He was said to have been born at the family&#x27;s estate at Exminster.

Being a native of the west of England, Courtenay was educated at Stapledon Hall, Oxford, and after graduating in law was chosen chancellor of the university in 1367. Courtenay&#x27;s ecclesiastical and political career began about the same time.

==Career==
Having been made prebendary of Exeter, of Wells and of York, he was consecrated bishop of Hereford on 17 March 1370, was translated to the see of London on 12 September 1375, and became Archbishop of Canterbury on 30 July 1381, succeeding Simon of Sudbury in both these latter positions.

As a politician, the period of Courtenay&#x27;s activity coincides with the years of Edward III&#x27;s dotage, and with practically the whole of Richard II&#x27;s reign. From the first he ranged himself among the opponents of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster; he was a firm upholder of the rights of the English Church, and was always eager to root out Lollardry. In 1373 he declared in convocation that he would not contribute to a subsidy until the evils from which the church suffered were removed; in 1375 he incurred the displeasure of the king by publishing a papal bull against the Florentines; and in 1377 his decided action during the quarrel between John of Gaunt and William of Wykeham ended in a temporary triumph for the bishop.

Wycliffe was another cause of difference between Lancaster and Courtenay. In 1377 the reformer appeared before Archbishop Sudbury and Courtenay, when an altercation between the duke and the bishop led to the dispersal of the court, and during the ensuing riot Lancaster probably owed his safety to the good offices of his foe. Having meanwhile become archbishop of Canterbury Courtenay summoned a synod, in London, the so-called &quot;Earthquake Synod&quot;, which condemned the opinions of Wycliffe; he then attacked the Lollards at Oxford, and urged the bishops to imprison heretics.

Courtenay was for a short time chancellor of England during 1381, and in January 1382 he officiated at the marriage of Richard II with Anne of Bohemia, afterwards crowning the queen. In 1382 the archbishop&#x27;s visitation led to disputes with the bishops of Exeter and Salisbury, and Courtenay was only partially able to enforce the payment of a special tax to meet his expenses on this occasion. During his concluding years the archbishop appears to have upheld the papal authority in England, although not to the injury of the English Church.

In 1390 Courtenay protested against confirmation of the Statute of Provisors 1350, and in 1393 he was successful in slightly modifying the Statute of Praemunire 1392. Disliking the extravagance of Richard II, Courtenay publicly reproved the king; and, after an angry scene, the royal threats drove him for a time into Devon. In 1386, he was one of the commissioners appointed to reform the kingdom and the royal household, and in 1387 he arranged a peace between Richard and his enemies under Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester.

==Death==
Courtenay died at Maidstone on 31 July 1396, and was buried towards the east end of the quire in Canterbury Cathedral. He was responsible for the expansion of his family&#x27;s chantry foundation in Somerset, Naish Priory, as well as significant building works at Christ Church Canterbury and Maidstone College.

<text>Thomas Secker (21 September 16933 August 1768) was an Archbishop of Canterbury in the Church of England.

==Early life and studies==
Secker was born in Sibthorpe, Nottinghamshire. In 1699, he went to Richard Brown&#x27;s free school in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, staying with his half-sister and her husband, Elizabeth and Richard Milnes. According to a story in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for 1768, Brown congratulated Secker for his successful studies by remarking, &quot;If thou wouldst but come over to the Church, I am sure thou wouldst be a bishop.&quot; Under Brown&#x27;s teaching, Secker believed that he had attained a competency in Greek and Latin.

He attended Timothy Jollie&#x27;s dissenting academy at Attercliffe in Sheffield from 1708, but was frustrated by Jollie&#x27;s poor teaching, famously remarking that he lost his knowledge of languages and that &quot;only the old Philosophy of the Schools was taught there: and that neither ably nor diligently. The morals also of many of the young Men were bad. I spent my time there idly &amp; ill&quot;. He left after one and a half years.

In 1710, he moved to London, staying in the house of the father of John Bowes, who had been one of Jollie&#x27;s students and would one day become Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Whilst here, he studied geometry, conic sections, algebra, French, and John Locke&#x27;s &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;.

==Tewkesbury Academy and Samuel Jones==
Also boarding at Bowes&#x27;s house was Isaac Watts, who encouraged Secker to attend the dissenting academy in Gloucester set up by Samuel Jones. There Secker recovered his ability at languages, supplementing his understanding of Greek and Latin with studies in Hebrew, Chaldee and Syriac. Jones&#x27;s course was also famous for his systems of Jewish antiquities and logic; maths was similarly studied to a higher than usual level.

Also at Jones&#x27;s academy contemporaneously with Secker were the later Church of England bishops Joseph Butler and Isaac Maddox and also John Bowes; other members included the future dissenting leaders Samuel Chandler, Jeremiah Jones and Vavasour Griffiths. In 1713, Jones moved his academy to larger premises in Tewkesbury, partly financed by £200 from Secker. But Secker soon became involved with the clandestine correspondence between Butler and a Church of England cleric, Samuel Clarke, concerning Clarke&#x27;s &quot;A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God&quot; (1705). Secker&#x27;s role was to deliver Butler&#x27;s letters personally to Gloucester post office and to pick up Clarke&#x27;s replies. Meanwhile, Jones had acquired a reputation as a heavy drinker and the standard of his teaching may have decreased. Both Butler and Secker left his academy shortly afterwards, Butler in February 1714 and Secker in June of the same year.

He studied medicine in London and Paris before receiving the degree of MD from Leiden University in 1721. Upon his return to England, he entered Exeter College, Oxford and was ordained, by special letters, in 1722 from the Chancellor of Oxford University.

==Career==
In 1724, he became rector of Houghton-le-Spring, Durham, resigning in 1727 on his appointment to the rectory of Holy Cross Church, Ryton, County Durham, and to a canonry of Durham. He became rector of St James&#x27;s Westminster in 1733 and Bishop of Bristol in 1735. About this time George II commissioned him to arrange a reconciliation between the Prince of Wales and himself, but the attempt was unsuccessful.

In 1737, he became the Bishop of Oxford and then the Dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, in 1750. On 21 April 1758, a month after the death of his predecessor, he became Archbishop of Canterbury.

His advocacy of an American episcopate, in connection with which he wrote the &quot;Answer&quot; to Jonathan Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;Observations on the Charter and Conduct of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts&quot; (London 1764), raised considerable opposition in England and America.

==Death, burial and legacy==
Secker died at the age of 74 at 3 August 1768 in Lambeth Palace. Church records of the adjacent medieval parish church of St Mary-at-Lambeth have revealed that Secker had his viscera buried in a canister in the churchyard. Secker left a substantial bequest to Ann and Thomas Frost of Nottingham. After Secker died his will was disputed by Thomas Frost, and he managed to persuade the court that £11,000 intended by Secker for charity should be redirected to his family.

<doc id="157928" wikidata="Q2425715" url="?curid=157928" title="Thomas Langton">
<text>Thomas Langton (died 27 January 1501) was chaplain to King Edward IV, before becoming successively Bishop of St David&#x27;s, Bishop of Salisbury, Bishop of Winchester, and Archbishop-elect of Canterbury.

==Early life==
Langton was born in Appleby-in-Westmorland, and educated by the Carmelite friars there. He matriculated at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, but soon removed to Cambridge, probably to Clare Hall, on account of the plague. In 1461 he was elected fellow of Pembroke Hall, serving as proctor in 1462. While at Cambridge he took both degrees in canon law, and was afterwards incorporated in them at Oxford. 

In 1464 he left the university, and some time before 1476 was made chaplain to King Edward IV. Langton was in high favour with the king, who trusted him much, and sent him on various important embassies. In 1467 he went as ambassador to France, and as king&#x27;s chaplain was sent to treat with Ferdinand II, king of Aragon, on 24 November 1476. He visited France again on diplomatic business on 30 November 1477, and on 11 August 1478, to conclude the espousals of Edward&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth and Charles, son of the French king. Two years later he was sent to demand the fulfilment of this marriage treaty, but the prince, now Charles VIII, king of France, refused to carry it out, and the match was broken off.

==Career==
Meanwhile, Langton received much ecclesiastical preferment. In 1478 he was made treasurer of Exeter, prebendary of St. Decuman&#x27;s, Wells Cathedral, and about the same time master of St. Julian&#x27;s Hospital, Southampton, a post which he still retained twenty years later. He was presented on 1 July 1480 to All Hallows Church, Bread Street, and on 14 May 1482 to All Hallows, Lombard Street, City of London, also becoming prebendary of North Kelsey, Lincoln Cathedral, in the next year. Probably by the favour of King Edward V, who granted him the temporalities of the see on 21 May, Langton was advanced in 1483 to the bishopric of St. Davids; the papal bull confirming the election is dated 4 July, and he was consecrated in August or September. 

Langton&#x27;s prosperity did not decline with Edward V&#x27;s deposition. He was sent on an embassy to Rome and to France by King Richard III, who translated him to the bishopric of Salisbury by papal bull dated 8 February 1485. Langton was also elected provost of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, on 6 December 1487, a post which he seems to have retained till 1495. He was a considerable benefactor to the college, where he built some new sets of rooms and enlarged the provost&#x27;s lodgings. In 1493 King Henry VII transferred him from Salisbury to Winchester, a see which had been vacant over a year. 

During the seven years that he was bishop of Winchester Langton started a school in the precincts of the palace, where he had youths trained in grammar and music. He was a good musician himself, used to examine the scholars in person, and encourage them by good words and small rewards. Finally, a proof of his ever-increasing popularity, Langton was elected Archbishop of Canterbury on 22 January 1501, but died of the plague on the 27th, before the confirmation of the deed. He was buried in a marble tomb within &#x27;a very fair chapel&#x27; which he had built south of the lady-chapel in Winchester Cathedral.

==Death==
Before his death he had given 10 pounds towards the erection of Great St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Cambridge, and in 1497 a drinking-cup, weighing 67 ounces, called the &#x27;Anathema Cup,&#x27; to Pembroke Hall. This is the oldest extant hanap or covered cup that is hall-marked. By his will, dated 16 January 1501, Langton left large sums of money to the priests of Clare Hall, Cambridge, money and vestments to the fellows and priests of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, besides legacies to the friars at both universities, and to the Carmelites at Appleby-in-Westmorland. To his sister and her husband, Rowland Machel, lands (probably the family estates) in Westmorland and two hundred marks were bequeathed. An annual pension of eight marks was set aside to maintain a chapel at Appleby-in-Westmorland for a hundred years to pray for the souls of Langton, his parents, and all the faithful deceased at Appleby-in-Westmorland.

<text>Oda (or Odo; died 958) the Good was a 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury in England. The son of a Danish invader, Oda became Bishop of Ramsbury before 928. A number of stories were told about his actions both prior to becoming and while a bishop, but few of these incidents are recorded in contemporary accounts. After being named to Canterbury in 941, Oda was instrumental in crafting royal legislation as well as involved in providing rules for his clergy. Oda was also involved in the efforts to reform religious life in England. He died in 958 and legendary tales afterwards were ascribed to him. Later he came to be regarded as a saint, and a hagiography was written in the late 11th or early 12th century.

==Early career==

Oda&#x27;s parents were Danish, and he may have been born in East Anglia. His father was said to have been a Dane who came to England in 865, together with the Viking army of Ubba and Ivar, and presumably settled in East Anglia. Oda&#x27;s nephew Oswald of Worcester later became Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald&#x27;s relatives Oscytel, afterwards Archbishop of York, and Thurcytel, an abbot, were also relatives of Oda, but this is not known for sure.

In Byrhtferth of Ramsey&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Oswald&quot;, Oda is said to have joined the household of a pious nobleman called Æthelhelm, whom he accompanied to Rome on pilgrimage. While on pilgrimage, Oda healed the nobleman&#x27;s illness. Other stories, such as those by the 12th-century writer William of Malmesbury, describe Oda as fighting under Edward the Elder and then becoming a priest, but these statements are unlikely. Other statements in the &quot;Life&quot; have Oda being named &quot;Bishop of Wilton&quot; by the king, who is stated to have been Æthelhelm&#x27;s brother. The chronicler may be referring, slightly inaccurately, to Aethelhelm cousin of the king. This benefactor has also been associated with bishop Athelm, who reportedly sponsored Oda in his ecclesiastical career. Some sources state that Oda became a monk at Fleury-sur-Loire in France.

==Bishop of Ramsbury==

Oda was consecrated Bishop of Ramsbury sometime between 909 and 927, not to Wilton as stated by both William of Malmesbury and the &quot;Life&quot;. The appointment was most likely made by King Æthelstan, and the first securely attested mention in documents of the new bishop occurs in 928, when he is a witness to royal charters as bishop. According to the late tenth-century chronicler, Richer of Rheims, in 936 Æthelstan sent Oda to France to arrange the return to the throne of France of King Louis IV. Louis was Æthelstan&#x27;s nephew and had been in exile in England for a number of years. However, this story is not related in any contemporary records. Oda was said to have accompanied King Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937. It was at this battle that Oda is said to have miraculously provided a sword to the king when the king&#x27;s own sword slipped out of its scabbard. A Ramsey chronicle records that in the 1170s, the sword was still preserved in the royal treasury, although the chronicler carefully states the story &quot;as is said&quot; rather than as fact. There are no contemporary records of Oda&#x27;s appearance at the battle. In 940, Oda arranged a truce between Olaf III Guthfrithson, king of Dublin and York, and Edmund I, king of England.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
Oda was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury following Wulfhelm&#x27;s death on 12 February 941. It is not known whether he went to Rome to receive his pallium or when he received it, but it was before he issued his &quot;Constitutions&quot;. During his time as archbishop, he helped King Edmund with the new royal law-code, which had a number of laws concerned with ecclesiastical affairs. The archbishop was present, along with Archbishop Wulfstan of York, at council that proclaimed the first of these law codes and which was held by Edmund at London, over Easter around 945 or 946. Oda also settled a dispute over the Five Boroughs with Wulfstan.

Oda also issued &quot;Constitutions&quot;, or rules, for his clergy. His &quot;Constitutions of Oda&quot; are the first surviving constitutions of a 10th-century English ecclesiastical reformer. Oda reworked some statutes from 786 to form his updated code, and one item that was dropped were any clauses dealing with paganism. Other items covered were relations between laymen and the clergy, the duties of bishops, the need for the laity to make canonical marriages, how to observe fasts, and the need for tithes to be given by the laity. The work is extant in just one surviving manuscript, British Library Cotton MS Vespasian A XIV, folios 175v to 177v. This is an 11th-century copy done for Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York.

At the death of King Eadred of England in 955, Oda was one of the recipients of a bequest from the king, in his case a large amount of gold. He was probably behind the reestablishment of a bishopric at Elmham, as the line of bishops in that see starts with Eadwulf of Elmham in 956. Oda crowned King Eadwig in 956, but in late 957 the archbishop joined Eadwig&#x27;s rival and brother Edgar who had been proclaimed king of the Mercians in 957, while Eadwig continued to rule Wessex. The exact cause of the rupture between the two brothers that led to the division of the previously united kingdom is unknown, but may have resulted from Eadwig&#x27;s efforts to promote close kinsmen and his wife. The division was peaceful, and Eadwig continued to call himself &quot;King of the English&quot; in contrast to Edgar&#x27;s title of &quot;King of the Mercians&quot;. In early 958 Oda annulled the marriage of Eadwig and his wife Ælfgifu, who were too closely related. This act was likely a political move connected to the division between Eadwig and Edgar, as it is unlikely that the close kinship between Eadwig and Ælfgifu had not been known before their marriage.

Oda was a supporter of Dunstan&#x27;s monastic reforms, and was a reforming agent in the church along with Cenwald the Bishop of Worcester and Ælfheah the Bishop of Winchester. He also built extensively, and re-roofed Canterbury Cathedral. after raising the walls higher. In 948, Oda took Saint Wilfrid&#x27;s relics from Ripon. Frithegod&#x27;s verse &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; has a preface that was written by Oda, in which the archbishop claimed that he rescued the relics from Ripon, which he described as &quot;decayed&quot; and &quot;thorn-covered&quot;. He also acquired the relics of St Ouen, and Frithegod also wrote, at Oda&#x27;s behest, a verse life of that saint, which has been lost. He was also active in reorganizing the diocesan structure of his province, as the sees of Elmham and Lindsey were reformed during his archbishopric.

The archbishop died on 2 June 958 and is regarded as a saint, with a feast day of 4 July. Other dates were also commemorated, including 2 June or 29 May. After his death, legendary tales ascribed miracles to him, including one where the Eucharist dripped with blood. Another was the miraculous repair of a sword. There is no contemporary evidence for veneration being made to Oda, with the first indication of cult coming in the hagiography written by Byrhtferth about Oswald, but no hagiography specifically about Oda was written until Eadmer wrote the &quot;Vita sancti Odonis&quot; sometime between 1093 and 1125. Oda was known by contemporaries as &quot;The Good&quot; and also became known as &quot;Severus&quot; &quot;The Severe&quot;.

<doc id="157932" wikidata="Q925177" url="?curid=157932" title="Index of coincidence">
<text>In cryptography, coincidence counting is the technique (invented by William F. Friedman) of putting two texts side-by-side and counting the number of times that identical letters appear in the same position in both texts. This count, either as a ratio of the total or normalized by dividing by the expected count for a random source model, is known as the index of coincidence, or IC or IOC or IoC for short.

Because letters in a natural language are not distributed evenly, the IC is higher for such texts than it would be for uniformly random text strings. What makes the IC especially useful is the fact that its value does not change if both texts are scrambled by the same single-alphabet substitution cipher, allowing a cryptanalyst to quickly detect that form of encryption.

==Calculation==

The index of coincidence provides a measure of how likely it is to draw two matching letters by randomly selecting two letters from a given text. The chance of drawing a given letter in the text is (number of times that letter appears / length of the text). The chance of drawing that same letter again (without replacement) is (appearances − 1 / text length − 1). The product of these two values gives you the chance of drawing that letter twice in a row. One can find this product for each letter that appears in the text, then sum these products to get a chance of drawing two of a kind. This probability can then be normalized by multiplying it by some coefficient, typically 26 in English.

where &quot;c&quot; is the normalizing coefficient (26 for English), &quot;n&quot;a is the number of times the letter &quot;a&quot; appears in the text, and &quot;N&quot; is the length of the text.

We can express the index of coincidence IC for a given letter-frequency distribution as a summation:

:formula_2

where &quot;N&quot; is the length of the text and &quot;n&quot;1 through &quot;nc&quot; are the frequencies (as integers) of the &quot;c&quot; letters of the alphabet (&quot;c&quot; = 26 for monocase English). The sum of the &quot;ni&quot; is necessarily &quot;N&quot;.

The products count the number of combinations of &quot;n&quot; elements taken two at a time. (Actually this counts each pair twice; the extra factors of 2 occur in both numerator and denominator of the formula and thus cancel out.) Each of the &quot;ni&quot; occurrences of the &quot;i&quot; -th letter matches each of the remaining occurrences of the same letter. There are a total of letter pairs in the entire text, and 1/&quot;c&quot; is the probability of a match for each pair, assuming a uniform random distribution of the characters (the &quot;null model&quot;; see below). Thus, this formula gives the ratio of the total number of coincidences observed to the total number of coincidences that one would expect from the null model.

The expected average value for the IC can be computed from the relative letter frequencies of the source language:

:formula_3

If all letters of an alphabet were equally probable, the expected index would be 1.0.
The actual monographic IC for telegraphic English text is around 1.73, reflecting the unevenness of natural-language letter distributions.

Sometimes values are reported without the normalizing denominator, for example for English; such values may be called &quot;κ&quot;p (&quot;kappa-plaintext&quot;) rather than IC, with &quot;κ&quot;r (&quot;kappa-random&quot;) used to denote the denominator (which is the expected coincidence rate for a uniform distribution of the same alphabet, for English). English plaintext will generally fall somewhere in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 (normalized calculation).

==Application==

The index of coincidence is useful both in the analysis of natural-language plaintext and in the analysis of ciphertext (cryptanalysis). Even when only ciphertext is available for testing and plaintext letter identities are disguised, coincidences in ciphertext can be caused by coincidences in the underlying plaintext. This technique is used to cryptanalyze the Vigenère cipher, for example. For a repeating-key polyalphabetic cipher arranged into a matrix, the coincidence rate within each column will usually be highest when the width of the matrix is a multiple of the key length, and this fact can be used to determine the key length, which is the first step in cracking the system.

Coincidence counting can help determine when two texts are written in the same language using the same alphabet. (This technique has been used to examine the purported Bible code). The &quot;causal&quot; coincidence count for such texts will be distinctly higher than the &quot;accidental&quot; coincidence count for texts in different languages, or texts using different alphabets, or gibberish texts.

To see why, imagine an &quot;alphabet&quot; of only the two letters A and B. Suppose that in our &quot;language&quot;, the letter A is used 75% of the time, and the letter B is used 25% of the time. If two texts in this language are laid side by side, then the following pairs can be expected:

Overall, the probability of a &quot;coincidence&quot; is 62.5% (56.25% for AA + 6.25% for BB).

Now consider the case when &quot;both&quot; messages are encrypted using the simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher which replaces A with B and vice versa:

The overall probability of a coincidence in this situation is 62.5% (6.25% for AA + 56.25% for BB), exactly the same as for the unencrypted &quot;plaintext&quot; case. In effect, the new alphabet produced by the substitution is just a uniform renaming of the original character identities, which does not affect whether they match.

Now suppose that only &quot;one&quot; message (say, the second) is encrypted using the same substitution cipher (A,B)→(B,A). The following pairs can now be expected:

Now the probability of a coincidence is only 37.5% (18.75% for AA + 18.75% for BB). This is noticeably lower than the probability when same-language, same-alphabet texts were used. Evidently, coincidences are more likely when the most frequent letters in each text are the same.

The same principle applies to real languages like English, because certain letters, like E, occur much more frequently than other letters—a fact which is used in frequency analysis of substitution ciphers. Coincidences involving the letter E, for example, are relatively likely. So when any two English texts are compared, the coincidence count will be higher than when an English text and a foreign-language text are used.

This effect can be subtle. For example, similar languages will have a higher coincidence count than dissimilar languages. Also, it is not hard to generate random text with a frequency distribution similar to real text, artificially raising the coincidence count. Nevertheless, this technique can be used effectively to identify when two texts are likely to contain meaningful information in the same language using the same alphabet, to discover periods for repeating keys, and to uncover many other kinds of nonrandom phenomena within or among ciphertexts.

Expected values for various languages are:
==Generalization==

The above description is only an introduction to use of the index of coincidence, which is related to the general concept of correlation. Various forms of Index of Coincidence have been devised; the &quot;delta&quot; I.C. (given by the formula above) in effect measures the autocorrelation of a single distribution, whereas a &quot;kappa&quot; I.C. is used when matching two text strings. Although in some applications constant factors such as formula_4 and formula_5 can be ignored, in more general situations there is considerable value in truly &quot;indexing&quot; each I.C. against the value to be expected for the null hypothesis (usually: no match and a uniform random symbol distribution), so that in every situation the expected value for no correlation is 1.0. Thus, any form of I.C. can be expressed as the ratio of the number of coincidences actually observed to the number of coincidences expected (according to the null model), using the particular test setup.

From the foregoing, it is easy to see that the formula for kappa I.C. is

:formula_6

where formula_5 is the common aligned length of the two texts &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, and the bracketed term is defined as 1 if the formula_8-th letter of text &quot;A&quot; matches the formula_8-th letter of text &quot;B&quot;, otherwise 0.

A related concept, the &quot;bulge&quot; of a distribution, measures the discrepancy between the observed I.C. and the null value of 1.0. The number of cipher alphabets used in a polyalphabetic cipher may be estimated by dividing the expected bulge of the delta I.C. for a single alphabet by the observed bulge for the message, although in many cases (such as when a repeating key was used) better techniques are available.

==Example==

As a practical illustration of the use of I.C., suppose that we have intercepted the following ciphertext message:

(The grouping into five characters is just a telegraphic convention and has nothing to do with actual word lengths.)
Suspecting this to be an English plaintext encrypted using a Vigenère cipher with normal A–Z components and a short repeating keyword, we can consider the ciphertext &quot;stacked&quot; into some number of columns, for example seven:

If the key size happens to have been the same as the assumed number of columns, then all the letters within a single column will have been enciphered using the same key letter, in effect a simple Caesar cipher applied to a random selection of English plaintext characters. The corresponding set of ciphertext letters should have a roughness of frequency distribution similar to that of English, although the letter identities have been permuted (shifted by a constant amount corresponding to the key letter). Therefore, if we compute the aggregate delta I.C. for all columns (&quot;delta bar&quot;), it should be around 1.73. On the other hand, if we have incorrectly guessed the key size (number of columns), the aggregate delta I.C. should be around 1.00. So we compute the delta I.C. for assumed key sizes from one to ten:

We see that the key size is most likely five. If the actual size is five, we would expect a width of ten to also report a high I.C., since each of its columns also corresponds to a simple Caesar encipherment, and we confirm this.
So we should stack the ciphertext into five columns:

We can now try to determine the most likely key letter for each column considered separately, by performing trial Caesar decryption of the entire column for each of the 26 possibilities A–Z for the key letter, and choosing the key letter that produces the highest correlation between the decrypted column letter frequencies and the relative letter frequencies for normal English text. That correlation, which we don&#x27;t need to worry about normalizing, can be readily computed as

:formula_10

where formula_11 are the observed column letter frequencies and formula_12 are the relative letter frequencies for English.
When we try this, the best-fit key letters are reported to be &quot;codice_1,&quot; which we recognize as an actual word, and using that for Vigenère decryption produces the plaintext: 
from which one obtains:

after word divisions have been restored at the obvious positions. &quot;codice_2&quot; are evidently &quot;null&quot; characters used to pad out the final group for transmission.

This entire procedure could easily be packaged into an automated algorithm for breaking such ciphers. Due to normal statistical fluctuation, such an algorithm will occasionally make wrong choices, especially when analyzing short ciphertext messages.

<text>Thomas Tenison (29 September 163614 December 1715) was an English church leader, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1694 until his death. During his primacy, he crowned two British monarchs.

==Life==
He was born at Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, the son and grandson of Anglican clergymen, who were both named John Tenison; his mother was Mercy Dowsing. He was educated at Norwich School, going on to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, as a scholar on Archbishop Matthew Parker&#x27;s foundation. He graduated in 1657, and was chosen fellow in 1659. For a short time he studied medicine, but in 1659 was privately ordained. As curate of St Andrew the Great, Cambridge from 1662, he set an example by his devoted attention to the sufferers from the plague. In 1667 he was presented to the living of Holywell-cum-Needingworth, Huntingdonshire, by the Earl of Manchester, to whose son he had been tutor, and in 1670 to that of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich.

In 1680 he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and was presented by King Charles II to the important London church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Tenison, according to Gilbert Burnet, &quot;endowed schools including Archbishop Tenison&#x27;s School, Lambeth, founded in 1685 and Archbishop Tenison&#x27;s School, Croydon, founded in 1714, set up a public library, and kept many curates to assist him in his indefatigable labours&quot;. Being a strenuous opponent of the Church of Rome, and &quot;Whitehall lying within that parish, he stood as in the front of the battle all King James&#x27;s reign&quot;. In 1678, in a &quot;Discourse of Idolatry&quot;, he condemned the heathenish idolatry practised in the Church of Rome, and in a sermon which he published in 1681 on &quot;Discretion in Giving Alms&quot; was attacked by Andrew Poulton, head of the Jesuits in the Savoy. Tenison&#x27;s reputation as an enemy of Romanism led the Duke of Monmouth to send for him before his execution in 1685, when Bishops Thomas Ken and Francis Turner refused to administer holy communion; but, although Tenison spoke to him in &quot;a softer and less peremptory manner&quot; than the two bishops, he was, like them, not satisfied with the sufficiency of Monmouth&#x27;s penitence.

Under King William III, Tenison was in 1689 named a member of the ecclesiastical commission appointed to prepare matters towards a reconciliation of the Dissenters, the revision of the liturgy being specially entrusted to him. A sermon he preached on the commission was published the same year.

He strongly supported, at least in public, the Glorious Revolution, though not without some private misgivings, especially concerning the ejection of Archbishop William Sancroft and the other &quot;non-juring&quot; bishops. Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon in his diary records some frank remarks made by Tenison on this subject at a dinner party in 1691:

That there had been irregularities in our settlement; that it was wished that things had been otherwise, but that we were now to make the best of it, and support this government as it was, for fear of a worse.

He preached a funeral sermon for Nell Gwyn in 1687, in which he represented her as truly penitent – a charitable judgment that did not meet with universal approval. The general liberality of Tenison&#x27;s religious views won him royal favour, and, after being made Bishop of Lincoln in 1691, he was promoted to Archbishop of Canterbury in December 1694.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==

He attended Queen Mary during her last illness and preached her funeral sermon in Westminster Abbey. In 1695, when William went to take command of the army in the Netherlands, Tenison was appointed one of the seven lords justices to whom his authority was delegated. After Mary&#x27;s death, Tenison was one of those who persuaded the King that his long and bitter quarrel with her sister Anne must be ended, as it had weakened the authority of the Crown. He was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of England in 1695 upon his appointment as Archbishop of Canterbury. This gave him the Honorific Title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for Life.

==Under Queen Anne==

Along with Gilbert Burnet, he attended King William on his deathbed. He crowned William&#x27;s successor, Queen Anne, but during her reign was in very little favour at court: the Queen thought that he inclined too much to the Low Church, and clashed repeatedly with him over her sole right to appoint bishops. She entirely ignored his wishes when she appointed Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet, as Bishop of Winchester: when he tried to remonstrate, the Queen cut him short with the cold remark that &quot;the matter was decided.&quot; Only with great difficulty did he persuade her to appoint his nominee William Wake, as Bishop of Lincoln.

Increasingly he lost influence to John Sharp, Archbishop of York, whom the Queen found far more congenial. He was a commissioner for the Union with Scotland in 1706; but in the last years of the Queen&#x27;s reign he was very much a secondary political figure, and from September 1710, though he was still nominally a member of the Cabinet, ceased to attend its meetings. A strong supporter of the Hanoverian succession, who shocked many by referring to Anne&#x27;s death as a blessing, he was one of three officers of state to whom, on the death of Anne, was entrusted the duty of appointing a regent till the arrival of George I, whom he crowned on 20 October 1714. For the last time at the coronation of an English monarch, the Archbishop asked if the people accepted their new King: the witty Catherine Sedley, former mistress of James II, remarked: &quot;Does the old fool think we will say no?&quot;. Tenison died in London a year later. He was instrumental in the last years of his life in the literary executorship of Sir Thomas Browne&#x27;s manuscript writings known as &quot;Christian Morals&quot;.

==Other works==
Besides the sermons and tracts above mentioned, and various others on the &quot;Popish&quot; controversy, Tenison was the author of &quot;The Creed of Mr Hobbes Examined&quot; (1670) and &quot;Baconia, or Certain Genuine Remains of Lord Bacon&quot; (1679). He was one of the founders of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.

==Family==
He married Anne, daughter of Richard Love; but died without issue. Edward Tenison (1673–1735) LL.B (Cantab.), his cousin, became Bishop of Ossory (Ireland) (1730/1731-1735). Another relative, Richard Tennison (1642–1705), became Bishop of Meath. Thomas is said to have advanced Richard in his career: in his will he left legacies to all of Richard&#x27;s five sons.

In appearance, he was described as a large, brawny, &quot;hulking&quot; figure, very strong when young but afflicted with gout in later life.

==Armorials==
The personal coat of arms of Archbishop Tenison consists of the arms of the see of Canterbury impaled with the Tenison family arms. The former, placed on the dexter side of honour, are blazoned as: &quot;Azure, an archiepiscopal cross in pale or surmounted by a pall proper charged with four crosses patee fitchee sable&quot;. The arms of Tenison, placed on the sinister side of the escutcheon are blazoned as: &quot;Gules, a bend engrailed argent voided azure, between three leopard&#x27;s faces or jessant-de-lys azure&quot;. In standard English: a red field bearing a white (or silver) diagonal band with scalloped edges, and a narrower blue band running down its centre. This lies between three gold heraldic lion&#x27;s faces, each of which is pierced by a fleur-de-lys entering through the mouth.

These arms are a difference, or variant, of the mediaeval arms of the family of Denys of Siston, Gloucestershire, and may have been adopted by the Tenison family because its name signifies &quot;Denys&#x27;s or Denis&#x27;s son&quot;. The arms were originally those of the Norman de Cantilupe family, whose feudal tenants the Denys family probably were in connection with Candleston Castle in Glamorgan. St Thomas Cantilupe (died 1282), bishop of Hereford, gave a reversed (i.e. upside down) version of the Cantilupe arms to the see of Hereford, which uses them to this day. A version of the Denys arms was also adopted by the family of the poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson, not known to have been a descendant of Archbishop Thomas Tenison.

==Suspected discovery of his coffin==

In 2016, during the refurbishment of the Garden Museum, which is housed at the medieval church of St Mary-at-Lambeth, 30 lead coffins were found; one with an archbishop&#x27;s red and gold mitre on top of it. Two archbishops were identified from nameplates on their coffins; with church records revealing that a further three archbishops, including Tenison, were likely to be buried in the vault.

<text>In cryptanalysis, frequency analysis (also known as counting letters) is the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext. The method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers.

Frequency analysis is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies. Moreover, there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language. For instance, given a section of English language, , , and are the most common, while , , and are rare. Likewise, , , , and are the most common pairs of letters (termed &quot;bigrams&quot; or &quot;digraphs&quot;), and , , , and are the most common repeats. The nonsense phrase &quot;ETAOIN SHRDLU&quot; represents the 12 most frequent letters in typical English language text.

In some ciphers, such properties of the natural language plaintext are preserved in the ciphertext, and these patterns have the potential to be exploited in a ciphertext-only attack.

== Frequency analysis for simple substitution ciphers ==
In a simple substitution cipher, each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another, and any particular letter in the plaintext will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext. For instance, if all occurrences of the letter turn into the letter , a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter would suggest to a cryptanalyst that represents .

The basic use of frequency analysis is to first count the frequency of ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them. More s in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that corresponds to in the plaintext, but this is not certain; and are also very common in English, so might be either of them. It is unlikely to be a plaintext or , which are less common. Thus the cryptanalyst may need to try several combinations of mappings between ciphertext and plaintext letters.

More complex use of statistics can be conceived, such as considering counts of pairs of letters (&quot;bigrams&quot;), triplets (&quot;trigrams&quot;), and so on. This is done to provide more information to the cryptanalyst, for instance, and nearly always occur together in that order in English, even though itself is rare.

=== An example ===
Suppose Eve has intercepted the cryptogram below, and it is known to be encrypted using a simple substitution cipher: 
For this example, uppercase letters are used to denote ciphertext, lowercase letters are used to denote plaintext (or guesses at such), and ~ is used to express a guess that ciphertext letter represents the plaintext letter .

Eve could use frequency analysis to help solve the message along the following lines: counts of the letters in the cryptogram show that is the most common single letter, most common bigram, and is the most common trigram. is the most common letter in the English language, is the most common bigram, and is the most common trigram. This strongly suggests that ~, ~ and ~. The second most common letter in the cryptogram is ; since the first and second most frequent letters in the English language, and are accounted for, Eve guesses that ~, the third most frequent letter. Tentatively making these assumptions, the following partial decrypted message is obtained.

Using these initial guesses, Eve can spot patterns that confirm her choices, such as &quot;. Moreover, other patterns suggest further guesses. &quot; might be &quot;, which would mean ~. Similarly &quot; could be guessed as &quot;, yielding ~ and ~. Furthermore, &quot; might be &quot;, giving ~. Filling in these guesses, Eve gets:

In turn, these guesses suggest still others (for example, &quot; could be &quot;&quot;, implying ~) and so on, and it is relatively straightforward to deduce the rest of the letters, eventually yielding the plaintext.

At this point, it would be a good idea for Eve to insert spaces and punctuation:

 Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle
 from a glass case in which it was enclosed. It was a beautiful scarabaeus, and, at
 that time, unknown to naturalists—of course a great prize in a scientific point
 of view. There were two round black spots near one extremity of the back, and a
 long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the
 appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and,
 taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion
 respecting it.

In this example from &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot;, Eve&#x27;s guesses were all correct. This would not always be the case, however; the variation in statistics for individual plaintexts can mean that initial guesses are incorrect. It may be necessary to backtrack incorrect guesses or to analyze the available statistics in much more depth than the somewhat simplified justifications given in the above example.

It is possible that the plaintext does not exhibit the expected distribution of letter frequencies. Shorter messages are likely to show more variation. It is also possible to construct artificially skewed texts. For example, entire novels have been written that omit the letter altogether — a form of literature known as a lipogram.

== History and usage ==


The first known recorded explanation of frequency analysis (indeed, of any kind of cryptanalysis) was given in the 9th century by Al-Kindi, an Arab polymath, in &quot;A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages&quot;. It has been suggested that a close textual study of the Qur&#x27;an first brought to light that Arabic has a characteristic letter frequency. Its use spread, and similar systems were widely used in European states by the time of the Renaissance. By 1474, Cicco Simonetta had written a manual on deciphering encryptions of Latin and Italian text.

Several schemes were invented by cryptographers to defeat this weakness in simple substitution encryptions. These included:

* &quot;Homophonic substitution&quot;: Use of &quot;homophones&quot; — several alternatives to the most common letters in otherwise monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. For example, for English, both X and Y ciphertext might mean plaintext E.
* &quot;Polyalphabetic substitution&quot;, that is, the use of several alphabets — chosen in assorted, more or less devious, ways (Leone Alberti seems to have been the first to propose this); and
* &quot;Polygraphic substitution&quot;, schemes where pairs or triplets of plaintext letters are treated as units for substitution, rather than single letters, for example, the Playfair cipher invented by Charles Wheatstone in the mid-19th century.

A disadvantage of all these attempts to defeat frequency counting attacks is that it increases complication of both enciphering and deciphering, leading to mistakes. Famously, a British Foreign Secretary is said to have rejected the Playfair cipher because, even if school boys could cope successfully as Wheatstone and Playfair had shown, &quot;our attachés could never learn it!&quot;.

The rotor machines of the first half of the 20th century (for example, the Enigma machine) were essentially immune to straightforward frequency analysis.
However, other kinds of analysis (&quot;attacks&quot;) successfully decoded messages from some of those machines.
Frequency analysis requires only a basic understanding of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem-solving skills, and, if performed by hand, tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. During World War II, both the British and the Americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the ciphers used by the Axis powers were breakable using frequency analysis, for example, some of the consular ciphers used by the Japanese. Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally IBM card type machinery) were first used in World War II, possibly by the US Army&#x27;s SIS. Today, the work of letter counting and analysis is done by computer software, which can carry out such analysis in seconds. With modern computing power, classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential data.

== Frequency analysis in fiction ==

Frequency analysis has been described in fiction. Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes tale &quot;The Adventure of the Dancing Men&quot; are examples of stories which describe the use of frequency analysis to attack simple substitution ciphers. The cipher in the Poe story is encrusted with several deception measures, but this is more a literary device than anything significant cryptographically.

<doc id="157935" wikidata="Q1162538" url="?curid=157935" title="Plaintext">
<text>In cryptography, plaintext usually means unencrypted information pending input into cryptographic algorithms, usually encryption algorithms. This usually refers to data that is transmitted or stored unencrypted.

==Overview==
With the advent of computing, the term &quot;plaintext&quot; expanded beyond human-readable documents to mean any data, including binary files, in a form that can be viewed or used without requiring a key or other decryption device. Information—a message, document, file, etc.—if to be communicated or stored in an unencrypted form is referred to as plaintext.

Plaintext is used as input to an encryption algorithm; the output is usually termed ciphertext, particularly when the algorithm is a cipher. Codetext is less often used, and almost always only when the algorithm involved is actually a code. Some systems use multiple layers of encryption, with the output of one encryption algorithm becoming &quot;plaintext&quot; input for the next.

==Secure handling==
Insecure handling of plaintext can introduce weaknesses into a cryptosystem by letting an attacker bypass the cryptography altogether. Plaintext is vulnerable in use and in storage, whether in electronic or paper format. &quot;Physical security&quot; means the securing of information and its storage media from physical, attack—for instance by someone entering a building to access papers, storage media, or computers. Discarded material, if not disposed of securely, may be a security risk. Even shredded documents and erased magnetic media might be reconstructed with sufficient effort.

If plaintext is stored in a computer file, the storage media, the computer and its components, and all backups must be secure. Sensitive data is sometimes processed on computers whose mass storage is removable, in which case physical security of the removed disk is vital. In the case of securing a computer, useful (as opposed to handwaving) security must be physical (e.g., against burglary, brazen removal under cover of supposed repair, installation of covert monitoring devices, etc.), as well as virtual (e.g., operating system modification, illicit network access, Trojan programs). Wide availability of keydrives, which can plug into most modern computers and store large quantities of data, poses another severe security headache. A spy (perhaps posing as a cleaning person) could easily conceal one, and even swallow it if necessary.

Discarded computers, disk drives and media are also a potential source of plaintexts. Most operating systems do not actually erase anything— they simply mark the disk space occupied by a deleted file as &#x27;available for use&#x27;, and remove its entry from the file system directory. The information in a file deleted in this way remains fully present until overwritten at some later time when the operating system reuses the disk space. With even low-end computers commonly sold with many gigabytes of disk space and rising monthly, this &#x27;later time&#x27; may be months later, or never. Even overwriting the portion of a disk surface occupied by a deleted file is insufficient in many cases. Peter Gutmann of the University of Auckland wrote a celebrated 1996 paper on the recovery of overwritten information from magnetic disks; areal storage densities have gotten much higher since then, so this sort of recovery is likely to be more difficult than it was when Gutmann wrote.

Modern hard drives automatically remap failing sectors, moving data to good sectors. This process makes information on those failing, excluded sectors invisible to the file system and normal applications. Special software, however, can still extract information from them.

Some government agencies (e.g., US NSA) require that personnel physically pulverize discarded disk drives and, in some cases, treat them with chemical corrosives. This practice is not widespread outside government, however. Garfinkel and Shelat (2003) analyzed 158 second-hand hard drives they acquired at garage sales and the like, and found that less than 10% had been sufficiently sanitized. The others contained a wide variety of readable personal and confidential information. See data remanence.

Physical loss is a serious problem. The US State Department, Department of Defense, and the British Secret Service have all had laptops with secret information, including in plaintext, lost or stolen. Appropriate disk encryption techniques can safeguard data on misappropriated computers or media.

On occasion, even when data on host systems is encrypted, media that personnel use to transfer data between systems is plaintext because of poorly designed data policy. For example, in October 2007, HM Revenue and Customs lost CDs that contained the unencrypted records of 25 million child benefit recipients in the United Kingdom.

Modern cryptographic systems resist known plaintext or even chosen plaintext attacks, and so may not be entirely compromised when plaintext is lost or stolen. Older systems resisted the effects of plaintext data loss on security with less effective techniques—such as padding and Russian copulation to obscure information in plaintext that could be easily guessed.

<doc id="157939" wikidata="Q1349886" url="?curid=157939" title="Robert Florey">
<text>Robert Florey (September 14, 1900 – May 16, 1979) was a French-American director, screenwriter, film journalist and actor.

Born as Robert Fuchs in Paris, he became an orphan at an early age and was then raised in Switzerland. In 1920 he worked at first as a film journalist, then as an assistant and extra in featurettes from Louis Feuillade. Florey moved to the United States in 1921. As a director, Florey&#x27;s most productive decades were the 1930s and 1940s, working on relatively low-budget fillers for Paramount and Warner Brothers. His reputation is balanced between his avant-garde expressionist style, most evident in his early career, and his work as a fast, reliable studio-system director called on to finish troubled projects, such as 1939&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Imperial&quot;.

Florey directed more than 50 films, the best known likely being the Marx Brothers first feature &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; (1929). His 1932 foray into Universal-style horror, &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, is regarded by horror fans as highly reflective of German expressionism. In 2006, as his 1937 film &quot;Daughter of Shanghai&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, Florey was called &quot;widely acclaimed as the best director working in major studio B-films&quot;.

==Life and work==
===Early life===
Florey grew up in Paris near the studio of George Melies, and as a young man served as assistant to Louis Feuillade. He was an assistant director on &quot;L&#x27;orpheline&quot; (1921), and &quot;Parisette&quot; (1921).

===Hollywood===
Florey went to Hollywood in 1921 as a journalist for Cinemagazine. He worked as foreign publicity director for Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford and was European advance manager for Rudolph Valentino.

He was an assistant director on &quot;Parisian Nights&quot; (1925). He went to MGM where he was an assistant on &quot;The Masked Bride&quot; (1925), &quot;Exquisite Sinner&quot; (1926), &quot;Bardelys the Magnificent&quot; (1926), &quot;La Bohème&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Magic Flame&quot; (1927). He also shot newsreel footage in New York.

===Early films===
Florey&#x27;s first film as director was &quot;One Hour of Love&quot; (1927) for Tiffany Productions. He did &quot;The Romantic Age&quot; (1927) for Columbia and &quot;Face Value&quot; (1927) for Stirling Pictures. He was assistant on &quot;The Woman Disputed&quot; (1928). He directed and co-wrote the 27-minute experimental film &quot;Johann the Coffinmaker&quot; in 1927, said to have been made for $200 in his spare time, shooting at night while working on other films in the daytime. The avant-garde film was made on only three sets, and involved a lot of trick photographic effects.

===Shorts===
In the late 1920s he produced two experimental short films: &quot;The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra&quot; (1928) co-directed with Slavko Vorkapić, and &quot;Skyscraper Symphony&quot; the following year. He also directed &quot;The Love of Zero&quot; (1928), &quot;Hello New York!&quot; (1928) with Maurice Chevalier, and &quot;Pusher-in-the-Face&quot; (1929) from a script and story by F. Scott Fitzgerald published for the first time on the magazine &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot;.

===Paramount===
Florey accepted a contract to direct at Paramount Pictures, where he made &quot;The Hole in the Wall&quot; (1929), starring Claudette Colbert and Edward G. Robinson, and &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; (1929), the first film of the Marx Brothers.

He directed the short &quot;Night Club&quot; (1929) with Fanny Brice and made &quot;The Battle of Paris&quot; (1929) with Gertrude Lawrence.

Florey went to England to direct the French musical &quot;The Road Is Fine&quot; (1930), and to Germany for &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Teacher&quot; (1930), a Spanish-language version of the film &quot;Rendezvous&quot;. While in Germany, he directed &quot;Love Songs&quot; (1930). He did &quot;Black and White&quot; (1931) with Raimu, co-directing with Marc Allegret.

===&quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;===
Florey made a significant but uncredited contribution to the script of the 1931 version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Florey was to be given the job of directing &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and he filmed a screen test with Bela Lugosi playing the monster, but Universal Pictures gave the job to James Whale, who cast Boris Karloff.

Instead Universal assigned Florey and Lugosi to &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (1932). Florey, with the help of cinematographer Karl Freund and elaborate sets representing 19th century Paris, made &quot;Murders&quot; into an American version of German expressionist films such as &quot;Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920).

Florey directed &quot;The Man Called Back&quot; (1932) with Conrad Nagel for Tiffany Pictures, and &quot;Those We Love&quot; (1932) with Mary Astor. He wrote the script for a version of &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (1933), which contained elements that strikingly anticipated Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1939 mystery novel &quot;Ten Little Niggers&quot; (later known as &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; or &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;).

===Warner Bros.===
Florey went to Warner Bros. where he directed a number of &quot;B&quot; movies: &quot;Girl Missing&quot; (1933) with Glenda Farrell and Ben Lyon, &quot;Ex-Lady&quot; (1933) with Bette Davis, &quot;The House on 56th Street&quot; (1933) with Kay Francis, &quot;Bedside&quot; (1934) with Warren William, &quot;Registered Nurse&quot; (1934) with Bebe Daniels, &quot;Smarty&quot; (1934) with Joan Blondell and William, &quot;I Sell Anything&quot; (1934) with Pat O&#x27;Brien,&quot;I Am a Thief&quot; (1934) with Astor, &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; (1935) with Barbara Stanwyck, and &quot;The Florentine Dagger&quot; (1935) with Donald Woods.

He did some uncredited work on &quot;Go into Your Dance&quot; (1935) with Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler, and he was the assistant director on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Your Number&quot; (1934). He also did some location filming in China for &quot;Oil for the Lamps of China&quot; (1935).

Florey directed &quot;Going Highbrow&quot; (1935) with Guy Kibbee, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bet on Blondes&quot; (1935) with William (and a young Errol Flynn), and &quot;The Payoff&quot; (1935) with James Dunn.

===Paramount===
Florey returned to Paramount where he directed &quot;Ship Cafe&quot; (1935) with Carl Brisson, &quot;The Preview Murder Mystery&quot; (1936) with Reginald Denny, &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot; (1936) with Herbert Marshall, &quot;Hollywood Boulevard&quot; (1936) with John Halliday and a young Robert Cummings, &quot;Outcast&quot; (1937) with William, &quot;King of Gamblers&quot; (1937) with Claire Trevor and Lloyd Nolan, &quot;Mountain Music&quot; (1937) with Bob Burns and Martha Raye, &quot;This Way Please&quot; (1937) with Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers and Betty Grable, &quot;Daughter of Shanghai&quot; (1937) with Anna May Wong, &quot;Dangerous to Know&quot; (1938) with Wong, and &quot;King of Alcatraz&quot; (1938) with Gail Patrick and Nolan. He did some uncredited work on &quot;Rose of the Rancho&quot; (1936). His films were marked by fast pace, cynical tone, Dutch angles, and dramatic lighting.

Florey directed &quot;Hotel Imperial&quot; (1939) with Isa Miranda and Ray Milland, &quot;The Magnificent Fraud&quot; (1939) with Akim Tamiroff and Nolan, &quot;Death of a Champion&quot; (1939) with Lynne Overman, &quot;Parole Fixer&quot; (1940) from a book by J. Edgar Hoover, and &quot;Women Without Names&quot; (1940) with Ellen Drew.

===Columbia===
Florey went to Columbia for &quot;The Face Behind the Mask&quot; (1941) with Peter Lorre, &quot;Meet Boston Blackie&quot; (1941) with Chester Morris, and &quot;Two in a Taxi&quot; (1941) with Anita Louise.

===Warner Bros.===
Florey went to Warner Bros. for &quot;Dangerously They Live&quot; (1941) with John Garfield, &quot;Lady Gangster&quot; (1942) with Faye Emerson and the big budget musical &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1943) with Dennis Morgan.

At 20th Century Fox he did some assisting on &quot;Bomber&#x27;s Moon&quot; (1943) and directed &quot;Roger Touhy, Gangster&quot; (1944) with Preston Foster. He went to Republic for &quot;Man from Frisco&quot; (1944).

In April 1944, he was burned when his car was on fire. Back at Warners Florey directed &quot;God Is My Co-Pilot&quot; (1945) with Morgan, and &quot;Danger Signal&quot; (1945) with Emerson and Zachary Scott.

He did some uncredited work on &quot;San Antonio&quot; (1945) with Errol Flynn and returned to the horror genre with &quot;The Beast with Five Fingers&quot; (1946).

He was also associate director to Charlie Chaplin on Chaplin&#x27;s film &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; (1947).

===Freelance director===
Florey directed &quot;Tarzan and the Mermaids&quot; (1948) with Johnny Weissmuller for Sol Lesser in Mexico, and two French Foreign Legion films: &quot;Rogues&#x27; Regiment&quot; (1948) with Dick Powell and &quot;Outpost in Morocco&quot; (1949) with George Raft.

He did &quot;The Crooked Way&quot; (1949) with John Payne, &quot;The Vicious Years&quot; (1950), &quot;Johnny One-Eye&quot; (1950) with Pat O&#x27;Brien, and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Haunt&quot; (1950) with Edgar Bergen then did some uncredited work on Flynn&#x27;s &quot;The Adventure of Captain Fabian&quot; (1951).

==Television==
Florey&#x27;s early works for television included &quot;The Walt Disney Christmas Show&quot; (1951) and &quot;Operation Wonderland&quot; (1951) for Disney.

<text>The 33 Variations on a waltz by Anton Diabelli, Op. 120, commonly known as the Diabelli Variations, is a set of variations for the piano written between 1819 and 1823 by Ludwig van Beethoven on a waltz composed by Anton Diabelli. It forms the first part of Diabelli&#x27;s publication &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein&quot;, the second part consisting of 50 variations by 50 other composers. It is often considered to be one of the greatest sets of variations for keyboard along with Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;.

The music writer Donald Tovey called it &quot;the greatest set of variations ever written&quot; and pianist Alfred Brendel has described it as &quot;the greatest of all piano works&quot;. It also comprises, in the words of Hans von Bülow, &quot;a microcosm of Beethoven&#x27;s art&quot;. In &quot;Beethoven: The Last Decade 1817–1827&quot;, Martin Cooper writes, &quot;The variety of treatment is almost without parallel, so that the work represents a book of advanced studies in Beethoven&#x27;s manner of expression and his use of the keyboard, as well as a monumental work in its own right&quot;. In his &quot;Structural Functions of Harmony&quot;, Arnold Schoenberg writes that the &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot; &quot;in respect of its harmony, deserves to be called the most adventurous work by Beethoven&quot;.

Beethoven&#x27;s approach to the theme is to take some of its smallest elements – the opening turn, the descending fourth and fifth, the repeated notes – and build upon them pieces of great imagination, power and subtlety. Alfred Brendel wrote, &quot;The theme has ceased to reign over its unruly offspring. Rather, the variations decide what the theme may have to offer them. Instead of being confirmed, adorned and glorified, it is improved, parodied, ridiculed, disclaimed, transfigured, mourned, stamped out and finally uplifted&quot;.

Beethoven does not seek variety by using key-changes, staying with Diabelli&#x27;s C major for most of the set: among the first twenty-eight variations, he uses the tonic minor only once, in Variation 9. Then, nearing the conclusion, Beethoven uses C minor for Variations 29–31 and for Variation 32, a triple fugue, he switches to E major. Coming at this late point, after such a long period in C major, the key-change has an increased dramatic effect. At the end of the fugue, a culminating flourish consisting of a diminished seventh arpeggio is followed by a series of quiet chords punctuated by silences. These chords lead back to Diabelli&#x27;s C major for Variation 33, a closing minuet.

== Background ==
In early 1819 Diabelli, a well-known music publisher and composer, sent a waltz of his creation to all the important composers of the Austrian Empire, including Franz Schubert, Carl Czerny, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, and the Archduke Rudolph, asking each of them to write a variation on it. His plan was to publish all the variations in a patriotic volume called &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein&quot;, and to use the profits to benefit orphans and widows of the Napoleonic Wars. Franz Liszt was not included, but it seems his teacher Czerny arranged for him to also provide a variation, which he composed at the age of 11.

Beethoven had had a connection with Diabelli for a number of years. About a slightly earlier period, 1815, Beethoven&#x27;s authoritative biographer, Alexander Wheelock Thayer, writes, &quot;Diabelli, born near Salzburg in 1781, had now been for some years one of the more prolific composers of light and pleasing music, and one of the best and most popular teachers in Vienna. He was much employed by Steiner and Co., as copyist and corrector, and in this capacity enjoyed much of Beethoven&#x27;s confidence, who also heartily liked him as a man.&quot; At the time of his project for variations on a theme of his own by various composers, Diabelli had advanced to become a partner in the publishing firm of Cappi and Diabelli.

The oft-told but now questionable story of the origins of this work is that Beethoven at first refused categorically to participate in Diabelli&#x27;s project, dismissing the theme as banal, a &quot;Schusterfleck&quot; or &#x27;cobbler&#x27;s patch,&#x27; unworthy of his time. Not long afterwards, according to the story, upon learning that Diabelli would pay a handsome price for a full set of variations from him, Beethoven changed his mind and decided to show how much could be done with such slim materials. (In another version of the legend, Beethoven was so insulted at being asked to work with material he considered beneath him that he wrote 33 variations to demonstrate his prowess.) Today, however, this story is taken as more legend than fact. Its origins are with Anton Schindler, Beethoven&#x27;s unreliable biographer, whose account conflicts in a number of ways with several established facts, indicating that he did not have first-hand knowledge of events.

At some point, Beethoven certainly did accept Diabelli&#x27;s proposal, but rather than contributing a single variation on the theme, he planned a large set of variations. To begin work he laid aside his sketching of the Missa solemnis, completing sketches for four variations by early 1819. (Schindler was so far off the mark that he claimed, &quot;At the most, he worked three months on it, during the summer of 1823&quot;. Carl Czerny, a pupil of Beethoven, claimed that &quot;Beethoven wrote these Variations in a merry freak&quot;.) By the summer of 1819, he had completed twenty-three of the set of thirty-three. In February 1820, in a letter to the publisher Simrock, he mentioned &quot;grand variations&quot;, as yet incomplete. Then he laid the work aside for several years – something Beethoven rarely did – while he returned to the Missa solemnis and the late piano sonatas.

In June 1822, Beethoven offered to his publisher Peters &quot;Variations on a waltz for pianoforte alone (there are many)&quot;. In the autumn of the same year he was in negotiations with Diabelli, writing to him, &quot;The fee for the Variat. should be 40 ducats at the most if they are worked out on as large a scale as planned, but if this should &quot;not take place&quot;, it would be set for &quot;less&quot;&quot;. It was probably in February 1823 that Beethoven returned to the task of completing the set. By March or April 1823, the full set of thirty-three variations was finished. By April 30 a copy was ready to send to Ries in London.
Beethoven kept the original set of twenty-three in order, but inserted nos. 1 (the opening march), 2, 15, 23 (sometimes called a parody of a Cramer finger exercise), 24 (a lyrical fughetta), 25, 26, 28, 29 (the first of the series of three slow variations leading to the final fugue and minuet), 31 (the third, highly expressive slow variation leading directly into the final fugue and minuet) and 33 (the concluding minuet).

One suggestion on what prompted Beethoven to write a set of &quot;grand variations&quot; on Diabelli&#x27;s theme is the influence of the Archduke Rudolph who, in the previous year, under Beethoven&#x27;s tutelage, had composed a huge set of forty variations on a theme by Beethoven. In a letter of 1819 to the Archduke, Beethoven mentions that &quot;in my writing-desk there are several compositions that bear witness to my remembering Your Imperial Highness&quot;.

Several theories have been advanced on why he decided to write thirty-three variations. He might have been trying to outdo himself after his 32 Variations in C minor, or trying to outdo Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; with its total of thirty-two pieces (two presentations of the theme and thirty variations).
There is a story that Diabelli was pressing Beethoven to send him his contribution to the project, whereupon Beethoven asked, &quot;How many contributions have you got?&quot; &quot;Thirty-two&quot;, said Diabelli. &quot;Go ahead and publish them&quot;, Beethoven is purported to have replied, &quot;I shall write thirty-three all by myself.&quot; Alfred Brendel observes, &quot;In Beethoven&#x27;s own pianistic output, the figures 32 and 33 have their special significance: 32 sonatas are followed by 33 variations as a crowning achievement, of which Var. 33 relates directly to the thirty-second&#x27;s final adagio.&quot; And Brendel adds, whimsically, &quot;There happens to be, between the 32 Variations in C minor and the sets Opp. 34 and 35, a numerical gap. The Diabelli Variations fills it.&quot;

Diabelli published the work quickly as Op. 120 in June of the same year, adding the following introductory note:

In the following year, 1824, it was republished as Volume 1 of the two-volume set &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein&quot;, the second volume comprising the 50 variations by 50 other composers. Subsequent editions no longer mentioned &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein&quot;.

== Title ==
The title Beethoven gave to the work has received some comment. His first reference was in his correspondence, where he called it &quot;Große Veränderungen über einen bekannten Deutschen Tanz&quot; (&quot;Grand Variations on a well-known German dance&quot;). Upon first publication, however, the title referred explicitly to a waltz by Diabelli: &quot;33 Veränderungen über einen Walzer von Diabelli&quot;.

Beethoven chose the German word &quot;Veränderungen&quot; rather than the usual Italian-derived &quot;Variationen&quot;, in a period when he preferred using the German language in expression marks and titles, such as &quot;Hammerklavier&quot;. Yet, apart from the title, we find only traditional Italian musical terms within the work, suggesting that Beethoven was probably trying to make a point in his use of &quot;Veränderungen&quot;. Since &quot;Veränderungen&quot; can mean not only &quot;variations&quot; but also &quot;transformations&quot;, it is sometimes suggested that Beethoven was announcing that this work does something more profound than had hitherto been done in variation form.

== Dedication ==
Although some commentators find significance in the work&#x27;s dedication to Mme. Antonie von Brentano, offering it as evidence that she was Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;, she was not Beethoven&#x27;s first choice. His original plan was to have the work sent to England where his old friend, Ferdinand Ries, would find a publisher. Beethoven promised the dedication to Ries&#x27;s wife (&quot;You will also receive in a few weeks 33 variations on a theme dedicated to your wife&quot;. Letter, April 25, 1823). A delay in the shipment to England caused confusion. Beethoven explained to Ries in a later letter, &quot;The variations were not to appear here until after they had been published in London, but everything went askew. The dedication to Brentano was intended only for Germany, as I was under obligation to her and could publish nothing else at the time. Besides, only Diabelli, the publisher here, got them from me. Everything was done by Schindler, a bigger wretch I never knew on God&#x27;s earth—an arch-scoundrel whom I have sent about his business—I can dedicate another work to your wife in place of it ...&quot;

== Diabelli&#x27;s theme ==
Whether Schindler&#x27;s story is true or not that Beethoven at first contemptuously dismissed Diabelli&#x27;s waltz as a &quot;Schusterfleck&quot; (&quot;rosalia&quot; / &quot;cobbler&#x27;s patch&quot;), there is no doubt the definition fits the work perfectly – &quot;musical sequences repeated one after another, each time modulated at like intervals&quot; – as can be seen clearly in these three examples:
# 

From the earliest days writers have commented on the juxtaposition between the waltz&#x27;s simplicity and the vast, complex musical structure Beethoven built upon it, and the widest possible range of opinions of Diabelli&#x27;s theme have been expressed. At one end of the spectrum is the admiration of Donald Tovey (&quot;healthy, unaffected, and drily energetic&quot;, &quot;rich in solid musical facts&quot;, cast in &quot;reinforced concrete&quot;) and Maynard Solomon (&quot;pellucid, brave, utterly lacking in sentimentality or affectation&quot;) and the kindly tolerance of Hans von Bülow (&quot;quite a pretty and tasteful little piece, protected from the dangers of obsolescence by what one might call its melodic neutrality&quot;). At the other end is William Kinderman&#x27;s contempt (&quot;banal&quot;, &quot;trite&quot;, &quot;a beer hall waltz&quot;).

In liner notes to Vladimir Ashkenazy&#x27;s 2006 Decca recording, Michael Steinberg attempts to pinpoint what Beethoven might have found appealing in the theme, writing:

Since the work was first published, commentators have tried to find patterns, even an overall plan or structure for this huge, diverse work, but little consensus has been reached. Several early writers sought to discover clear parallels with Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, without great success. Others claimed to have found symmetries, three groups of nine, for example, although the penultimate Fugue had to be counted as five. The work has been analyzed in terms of sonata form, complete with separate &#x27;movements.&#x27; What is not disputed, however, is that the work begins with a simple, rather commonplace musical idea, transforms it in many radical ways, and ends with a sequence of variations that are cathartic in the manner of other late Beethoven works.

=== By Maynard Solomon ===
Maynard Solomon in &quot;The Late Beethoven: Music, Thought, Imagination&quot; expresses this idea symbolically, as a journey from the everyday world (&quot;Diabelli&#x27;s theme conveys ideas, not only of the national, the commonplace, the humble, the rustic, the comic, but of the mother tongue, the earthly, the sensuous, and, ultimately, perhaps, of every waltzing couple under the sun&quot; to a transcendent reality. For Solomon the structure, if there is any, consists merely of &quot;clusters of variations representing forward and upward motion of every conceivable kind, character and speed&quot;. He sees demarcation points at Variations 8, 14 and 20, which he characterizes as three &quot;strategically placed plateaus [which] provide spacious havens for spiritual and physical renewal in the wake of the exertions which have preceded them&quot;.). Thus, his analysis yields four sections, variations 1–7, 9–13, 15–19 and 21–33.

=== By William Kinderman ===

The most influential writing on the work today is William Kinderman&#x27;s &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Diabelli Variations&quot;, which begins by carefully tracing the development of the work through various Beethoven sketchbooks. Of great significance, according to Kinderman, is the discovery that a few crucial variations were added in the final stage of composition, 1822–23 and inserted at important turning-points in the series. A careful study of these late additions reveals that they stand out from the others by having in common a return to, and special emphasis on, the melodic outline of Diabelli&#x27;s waltz, in the mode of parody.

For Kinderman, parody is the key to the work. He points out that most of the variations do not emphasize the simple features of Diabelli&#x27;s waltz: &quot;Most of Beethoven&#x27;s other variations thoroughly transform the surface of Diabelli&#x27;s theme, and though motivic materials from the waltz are exploited exhaustively, its affective model is left far behind&quot;. The purpose of the new variations is to recall Diabelli&#x27;s waltz so that the cycle does not spiral too far from its original theme. Without such a device, considering the great variety and complexity of the set, Diabelli&#x27;s waltz would become superfluous, &quot;a mere prologue to the whole.&quot; Parody is used because of the banality of Diabelli&#x27;s theme.

Kinderman distinguishes several forms of &quot;parody&quot;, pointing out several examples which have no special structural significance and which were composed in the earlier period, such as the humorous parody of the aria from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (Var. 22) and the parody of a Cramer finger exercise (Var. 23). He also mentions allusions to Bach (Vars. 24 and 32) and Mozart (Var. 33). But the added, structural variations recall Diabelli&#x27;s waltz, not Bach or Mozart or Cramer, and clearly highlight its most unimaginative aspects, especially its repetition of the C major tonic chord with G emphasized as the high note and the static harmony thus created.

The first of the three added variations is No. 1, a &quot;mock-heroic&quot; march which immediately follows Diabelli to open the set dramatically, echoing in the right hand the tonic triad of the theme while the left hand simply walks down in octaves Diabelli&#x27;s descending fourth. No. 2 even maintains the repeated root-position triad, demonstrating the intent to keep the beginning of the set somewhat anchored. Afterwards however, Diabelli is barely recognizable until Variation 15, the second structural variation, a brief, lightweight piece conspicuously inserted between several of the most powerful variations (Nos. 14, 16 and 17). It recalls and caricatures the original waltz by means of its prosaic harmony. The third and final structural variation, in Kinderman&#x27;s analysis, is No. 25, which shifts Diabelli&#x27;s monotonous rhythm from the bass to the treble and fills the bass with a simple figure endlessly repeated in a &quot;lumbering caricature&quot;. Arriving comically after the sublime Fughetta&#x27;s arresting conclusion, it opens the concluding section of the series, from the total unraveling of the following major variations and descent into minor, to the determination of the fugue, to the transcendence of the minuet.

Kinderman summarizes, &quot;Diabelli&#x27;s waltz is treated first ironically as a march that is half-stilted, half-impressive, and then, at crucial points in the form, twice recapitulated in amusing caricature variations. At the conclusion of the work, in the Fugue and last variation, reference to the melodic head of Diabelli&#x27;s theme once again becomes explicit – indeed, it is hammered into the ground. But any further sense of the original context of the waltz is lacking. By means of three parody variations, 1, 15, and 25, Beethoven established a series of periodic references to the waltz that draw it more closely into the inner workings of the set, and the last of these gives rise to a progression that transcends the theme once and for all. That is the central idea of the &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;.&quot;

Kinderman thus sees the work as falling into three sections, Variations 1–10, 11–24 and 25–33. Each section has a certain logic and ends with a clear break. Kinderman asserts that this large-scale structure effectively follows the sonata-allegro form of Exposition-Development-Recapitulation, or more generally, Departure-Return. The first section 1–10 begins with two deliberately conservative variations followed by progressive distancing from the waltz – in tempo, subdivision, extremity of register, and abstraction. Thus the effect of this section is expositional, with a grounded start and a sense of departure. The brilliant variation 10 is a clear climax, with no logical continuation other than a reset – indeed, the subdued, suspended 11 opposes 10 in practically every musical parameter, and the contrast is striking. Thus begun, the second section 11–24 is defined by between-variation contrast, with nearly every sequence a stark juxtaposition, often exploited for comic and dramatic effect. The tension and disorder achieved with these contrasts gives the section a developmental quality, an instability requiring a re-synthesis. The conclusion of the fughetta no. 24, with suspension and fermata, is the second major section break. Out of the solemn silence following 24, 25 enters humorously, the last moment of programmatic contrast and the last structural variation, anchoring the cycle to the theme once more before heading off into the final section. Variations 25–33 form another progressive series, rather than a collection of contrasts. The familiarity of 25 (especially after its predecessors) and the ensuing return to a progressive pattern give this section a recapitulatory quality. First the theme is subdivided and abstracted to the point of disintegration with 25–28. Variations 29–31 then descend into the minor, culminating in the baroque-romantic largo 31, the emotional climax of the work and the groundwork for the sense of transcendence to come. A dominant segue seamlessly heralds the massive fugue 32 – the &#x27;finale&#x27; in its relentless energy, virtuosity, and complexity. The intensely suspenseful final transition dissolves into the Minuet, at once a final goal and a denouement. The effect of the full cycle is the distinct sense of a dramatic arch – this could arguably be achieved to some extent from sheer duration; however, the strategically placed structural variations, meticulous sequencing, sweeping departure and return, and inspired final progression augment this effect and demonstrate its intentionality.

=== By Alfred Brendel ===
Alfred Brendel, in his essay &quot;Must Classical Music be Entirely Serious?&quot; takes an approach similar to Kinderman&#x27;s, making the case for the work as &quot;a humorous work in the widest possible sense&quot; and pointing out that early commentators took a similar view:

== The variations ==

===Theme: Vivace===

Diabelli&#x27;s theme, a waltz with off-beat accents and sharp changes in dynamics, was never intended for dancing. By this time, the waltz was no longer merely a dance but had become a form of art music. Alfred Brendel&#x27;s suggested title for Diabelli&#x27;s theme, in his essay &quot;Must Classical Music be Entirely Serious?&quot;, making the case for viewing the &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot; as a humorous work, is &quot;Alleged Waltz&quot;. Commentators do not agree on the intrinsic musical value of Diabelli&#x27;s theme.

===Variation 1: &quot;Alla marcia maestoso&quot;===

While Beethoven&#x27;s first variation stays close to the melody of Diabelli&#x27;s theme, there is nothing waltz-like about it. It is a strong, heavily accented march in time, greatly differing from the character and time of the theme. This sharp break from Diabelli announces that the series will not consist of mere decorative variations on a theme. The first variation, according to Tovey, gives &quot;emphatic proof that this is to be a very grand and serious work&quot;, describing it as &quot;entirely solemn and grand in style&quot;.

Kinderman, on the other hand, whose researches among the Beethoven sketchbooks discovered that Variation 1 was inserted late into the work, deems it a &quot;structural variation&quot;, echoing Diabelli more clearly than the non-structural variations and, in this case, parodying the weaknesses of the theme. Its character is, for Kinderman, &quot;pompous&quot; and &quot;mock-heroic&quot;. Alfred Brendel takes a view similar to Kinderman&#x27;s, characterizing this variation as &quot;serious but slightly lacking in brains&quot;. The title he offers is &quot;March: gladiator, flexing his muscles&quot;. Wilhelm von Lenz called it &quot;The Mastodon and the Theme—a fable.&quot;

===Variation 2: &quot;Poco allegro&quot;===

This variation was not part of Beethoven&#x27;s first series but was added somewhat later. While it returns to time after the preceding march, it echoes little of Diabelli&#x27;s theme. It is delicate, with a hushed, tense atmosphere. The only markings are and &quot;leggiermente&quot;. It moves in eighth notes, &quot;allegro&quot;, the treble and bass rapidly alternating throughout the entire piece. Near the end, the tension is increased by syncopations. Brendel suggests the delicacy of this variation by entitling it &quot;Snowflakes&quot;. Beethoven diverges from Diabelli&#x27;s structure of two equal parts, each one repeated, by omitting a repeat for the first part. Artur Schnabel, in his famous recording, repeated the first part anyway.

===Variation 3: &quot;L’istesso tempo&quot;===

Marked &quot;dol&quot; (&quot;dolce&quot;), this variation has a strong melodic line, although the original theme is not obvious. Mid-way through each section echoes the rising sequence which occurred at a similar point in Diabelli&#x27;s theme. In the second half, there is a remarkable pianissimo passage where the treble holds a chord for four full bars while the bass repeats a little three-note figure over and over, eight times, after which the melody proceeds as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.

This was the first variation in Beethoven&#x27;s original plan. From the earliest sketchbooks, Beethoven kept it together with the following Variation 4. Both use counterpoint, and the transition between them is seamless. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Confidence and nagging doubt&quot;.

===Variation 4: &quot;Un poco più vivace&quot;===

The steady rise in drama since Variation 2 reaches a high point in this variation. Here the excitement is brought front and centre, both halves of the piece racing in crescendos toward a pair of chords marked &quot;forte&quot;. The driving rhythm emphasizes the third beat of the bar. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Learned ländler&quot;.

===Variation 5: &quot;Allegro vivace&quot;===

This fifth variation is an exciting number with breathtaking rhythmic climaxes. For the first time in the series, there are elements of virtuosity, which will become more pronounced in the variations which immediately follow. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Tamed goblin&quot;.

===Variation 6: &quot;Allegro ma non troppo e serioso&quot;===

Both this and the following variations are brilliant, exciting, virtuoso pieces. This sixth variation features a trill in nearly every bar set off against arpeggios and hurried figures in the opposite hand. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Trill rhetorics (Demosthenes braving the surf)&quot;. Wilhelm von Lenz called it &quot;In the Tyrol&quot;.

===Variation 7: &quot;Un poco più allegro&quot;===

Sforzando octaves in the bass hand against triplets in the treble make for a brilliant, dramatic effect. Kinderman goes so far as to describe it as &quot;harsh&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Sniveling and stamping&quot;.

===Variation 8: &quot;Poco vivace&quot;===

After the three loud, dramatic variations which precede it, this eighth variation offers relief and contrast in the form of a soft, strongly melodic piece, the melody moving at a stately pace in half- and dotted half-notes, with the bass providing a quiet accompaniment in the form of rising figures. The marking is &quot;dolce e teneramente&quot; (&quot;sweetly and tenderly&quot;). Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Intermezzo (to Brahms)&quot;.

===Variation 9: &quot;Allegro pesante e risoluto&quot;===

This is the first variation to have a minor key. Simple but powerful, Variation 9 is constructed out of the slimmest of materials, consisting of little more than Diabelli&#x27;s opening grace-note and turn repeated in various registers. The direction is always ascending, building toward a climax. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Industrious nutcracker&quot;. Like Variation No. 1, he characterizes it as &quot;deeply serious but slightly lacking in brains&quot;.

===Variation 10: &quot;Presto&quot;===

Traditionally viewed as the close of a main division of the work, Variation 10 is the most brilliant of all the variations, a break-neck presto with trills, tremolos and staccato octave scales. Tovey comments, &quot;The tenth, a most exciting whirlwind of sound, reproduces all the sequences and rhythms of the theme so clearly that it seems much more like a melodic variation than it really is&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Giggling and neighing&quot;.

===Variation 11: &quot;Allegretto&quot;===

Another variation built out of Diabelli&#x27;s opening three notes, this one quiet and graceful. Kinderman points out how closely related Variations 11 and 12 are in structure. The opening of this variation appears in the movie &quot;Copying Beethoven&quot; as the theme of the sonata written by the copyist that Beethoven first ridicules then later, to redeem himself, begins to work on more seriously. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;″Innocente&#x27; (Bülow)&quot;.

===Variation 12: &quot;Un poco più moto&quot;===

Ceaseless motion with many running fourths. Kinderman sees this variation as foreshadowing Number 20 because of the simple way it exposes the harmonic structure. Tovey points out that it is a development of No. 11. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Wave Pattern&quot;. Variation 12 is another divergence from Diabelli&#x27;s two-part structure. The first part is unrepeated, while Beethoven writes out the repeat of the second part in full, making small changes.

===Variation 13: &quot;Vivace&quot;===

Powerful, rhythmic chords, forte, each time followed by nearly two bars of silence, then a soft reply. &quot;Eloquent pauses&quot;, in von Lenz&#x27;s words. &quot;Absurd silences&quot;, for Gerald Abraham. Barry Cooper sees it as a humorous piece, in which Beethoven &quot;seems almost to poke fun at Diabelli&#x27;s theme&quot;. Diabelli&#x27;s mild opening turn is turned into the powerful chords, and his repeated chords become a long silence. The sequence is ended with two soft, anti-climactic notes. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Aphorism (biting)&quot;.

===Variation 14: &quot;Grave e maestoso&quot;===

The first slow variation, &quot;grave e maestoso&quot;. Von Bülow comments, &quot;To imbue this wonderful number with what I should like to call the &#x27;high priestly solemnity&#x27; in which it was conceived, let the performer&#x27;s fantasy summon up before his eyes the sublime arches of a Gothic cathedral.&quot; Kinderman writes of its &quot;breadth and measured dignity&quot;, adding &quot;its spacious nobility brings the work to a point of exposure which arouses our expectations for some new and dramatic gesture.&quot; The three variations which follow certainly fulfill those expectations. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Here He Cometh, the Chosen&quot;.

===Variation 15: &quot;Presto scherzando&quot;===

One of the last variations composed, Variation 15 is short and light, setting the stage for the following two loud virtuoso displays. For Barry Cooper, this is another humorous variation poking fun at Diabelli&#x27;s theme. Tovey comments, &quot;The fifteenth variation gives the whole melodic outline [of the theme] so closely that its extraordinary freedom of harmony (the first half actually closes in the tonic) produces no effect of remoteness.&quot; Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Cheerful Spook&quot;.

Tovey gives a similar analysis of the variations:


===Variation 16: &quot;Allegro&quot;===

A virtuoso variation, &quot;forte&quot;, with trills and ascending and descending broken octaves. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation and the following one is &quot;Triumph&quot;.

===Variation 17: &quot;Allegro&quot;===

This is the second march after the opening variation, most of it &quot;forte&quot;, with accented octaves in the bass and ceaseless, hurried figures in the treble. For Tovey, &quot;This brings the first half of the work to a brilliant climax&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation and the preceding one is &quot;Triumph&quot;.

===Variation 18: &quot;Poco moderato&quot;===

Another variation using the opening turn in Diabelli&#x27;s waltz, this time with a quiet (&quot;dolce&quot;), almost meditative character. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Precious memory, slightly faded&quot;.

===Variation 19: &quot;Presto&quot;===

Fast and busy, in sharp contrast to the variation which follows. Von Bülow points out &quot;the canonic dialogue between the two parts&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Helter-skelter&quot;.

===Variation 20: &quot;Andante&quot;===

An extraordinarily slow-moving variation consisting almost entirely of dotted half notes in low registers – a striking contrast with the variations immediately before and after. Diabelli&#x27;s melody is easily identified, but the harmonic progressions (see bars 9–12) are unusual and the overall tonality is ambiguous. Suggesting the title &quot;Oracle&quot;, von Bülow recommends &quot;an effect suggestive of the veiled organ-registers&quot;. Kinderman writes, &quot;In this great enigmatic slow variation, No. 20, we have reached the still centre of the work ... the citadel of &#x27;inner peace&#x27;&quot;. Tovey calls it &quot;one of the most awe-inspiring passages in music&quot;. Brendel describes this Variation 20 as &quot;hypnotic introspection&quot; and offers as a title &quot;Inner sanctum&quot;. Liszt called it &quot;Sphinx&quot;. Diabelli&#x27;s two-part structure is maintained, but without repeats.

===Variation 21: &quot;Allegro con brio&quot; – &quot;Meno allegro&quot; – &quot;Tempo primo&quot;===

An extreme contrast to the preceding Andante. The beginning, in Kinderman&#x27;s analysis, of variations achieving &quot;transcendence&quot;, evoking &quot;the entire musical universe as Beethoven knew it&quot;. The accompanying chords repeated so many times at the start of each section and the repeated trills repeated from the highest to the lowest registers ruthlessly exaggerate features of Diabelli&#x27;s theme. Tovey describes this variation as &quot;startling&quot;, but points out that it follows Diabelli&#x27;s melody clearly and &quot;changes from quick common to slower triple time whenever it reproduces the sequential passages ... in the theme&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Maniac and moaner&quot;. Uhde groups Nos. 21–28 as the &quot;scherzo group&quot;, with the tender Fughetta (No. 24) standing in as a &quot;trio&quot;.

===Variation 22: &quot;Allegro molto, alla « Notte e giorno faticar » di Mozart&quot;===

A reference to Leporello&#x27;s aria in the beginning of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. The music is rather crudely humorous in style. Because Leporello is complaining that he has to &quot;Work day and night&quot;, it is sometimes said that here Beethoven is grumbling about the labour he poured into these variations. It has been suggested, too, that Beethoven is trying to tell us that Diabelli&#x27;s theme was stolen from Mozart. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;‘Notte e giorno faticar’ (to Diabelli)&quot;.

===Variation 23: &quot;Allegro assai&quot;===

For von Bülow, another virtuoso variation to close what he views as the second main division of the work. For Kinderman, a parody of finger exercises published by Johann Baptist Cramer (whom Beethoven did admire as a pianist, if not as a composer). Tovey refers to its &quot;orchestral brilliance and capricious rhythm&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;The virtuoso at boiling-point (to Cramer)&quot;. He characterizes Nos. 23, 27 and 28 as &quot;one-track minds in an excited state&quot;, suggesting an ironic approach.

===Variation 24: &quot;Fughetta&quot; (&quot;Andante&quot;)===

Lyrical and beautiful, greatly contrasting with the preceding variation, an allusion to Bach. Tovey describes this variation as &quot;a wonderfully delicate and mysterious web of sounds on a figure suggested partly by the treble and partly by the bass of the first four bars of the theme. Acting on a hint given him by the second half of Diabelli&#x27;s theme, Beethoven inverts this in the second half of the fughetta.&quot; Kinderman compares it with the concluding fugue in the last movement of the Sonata in A, Op. 110 and to the mood of &quot;certain quiet devotional passages in the &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;&quot;, both of which were composed in this same period. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Pure Spirit&quot;.

===Variation 25: &quot;Allegro&quot;===

Simple chords in the right hand over a ceaseless, busy pattern in the left hand. Tovey notes that it reproduces the opening of each half of Diabelli&#x27;s theme quite simply, although the rest is very free, adding that &quot;as a reaction from the impressively thoughtful and calm fughetta it has an intensely humorous effect&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Teutscher (German dance)&quot;.

===Variation 26: (&quot;Piacevole&quot;)===

This variation is a deconstruction of the theme, consisting entirely of three-note broken triad inversions and stepwise figures. The switch at the halfway point from descending to ascending passages, a characteristic of the waltz faithfully preserved throughout the work, is seen here. These three final C major variations before the minor section have in common a textural distance from the waltz. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Circles on the Water&quot;.

===Variation 27: &quot;Vivace&quot;===

The structure of this variation is similar to the one preceding, in the exclusive use of three-note figures, the descending-to-ascending pattern, and the switch to stepwise passagework in contrary motion at the midpoint of each half. The triplet pattern consisting of a semitone and a third is taken from the rosalias at measures 8–12 of the theme. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Juggler&quot;. He suggests an ironic approach, characterizing Nos. 23, 27 and 28 as &quot;one-track minds in an excited state&quot;.

===Variation 28: &quot;Allegro&quot;===

Von Bülow sees this as the close of the third main division of the work: &quot;This Variation ... must be hammered out with wellnigh raging impetuosity... More delicate shading would not be in place – at least in the First Part&quot;. (von Bülow)

Tovey writes:

Brendel points out that as of 1819 there was a single C minor variation (No. 30) and that the late additions of Nos. 29 and 31 expanded the use of the key into &quot;a larger C minor area&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;The rage of the jumping-jack&quot;.

===Variation 29: &quot;Adagio ma non troppo&quot;===

The first of three slow variations, this appears to be the beginning of the end: &quot;The composer transports us into a new, more earnest, even melancholy realm of feeling. It might be regarded as beginning the Adagio of this Variation-sonata; from this Adagio we are carried back, by the grand double fugue, Variation 32, into the original bright sphere of the tone-poem, the general character of which receives its seal in the graceful Minuetto-Finale&quot;. (von Bülow) Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Stifled sighs (Konrad Wolff)&quot;.

===Variation 30: &quot;Andante, sempre cantabile&quot;===

&quot;A kind of Baroque lament&quot; (Kinderman). Slow and expressive, like the variation which follows. Its final bars lead smoothly to Variation 31. Commentators have used strong language for the concluding section. Tovey describes it as &quot;a phrase so haunting that though Beethoven does not repeat the entire sections of this variation he marks the last four bars to be repeated&quot;. Von Bulow says, &quot;We can recognize in these four measures the original germ of the entire romanticism of Schumann&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;Gentle grief&quot;. There are only hints of Diabelli&#x27;s two-part structure.

===Variation 31: &quot;Largo, molto espressivo&quot;===

Deeply felt, filled with ornaments and trills, there are many similarities with the arietta of Piano Sonata, Op. 111. Tovey again uses superlatives: &quot;The thirty-first variation is an extremely rich outpouring of highly ornamented melody, which to Beethoven&#x27;s contemporaries must have been hardly intelligible, but which we, who have learnt from Bach that a great artist&#x27;s feeling is often more profound where his expression is most ornate, can recognize for one of the most impassioned utterances in all music.&quot;

Von Bülow comments, &quot;We should like to style this number, thoughtful and tender alike, a renascence of the Bach Adagio, as the succeeding double fugue is one of the Handel Allegros. Conjoining to these the final Variations, which might be considered as a new birth, so to speak, of the Haydn-Mozart Minuet, we possess, in these three Variations, a compendium of the whole history of music.&quot; The ending of this variation, an unresolved dominant seventh, leads naturally to the following fugue. Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;To Bach (to Chopin)&quot;. The structure is a foreshortening of Diabelli&#x27;s theme.

===Variation 32: &quot;Fuga: Allegro&quot;===

While in traditional variation sets a fugue was often used to conclude the work, Beethoven uses his fugue to reach a grand climax, then follows it with a final, quiet minuet. The fugue of Variation 32 is set apart by its foreign key, E major: it is the only variation where C is not the tonic. Structurally, the piece abandons Diabelli&#x27;s two-part original. Melodically, it is based on Diabelli&#x27;s falling fourth, used in many of the preceding variations, as well as, most strikingly, on the least inspired, least promising part of Diabelli&#x27;s theme, the note repeated ten times. The bass in the opening bars takes Diabelli&#x27;s rising figure and presents it in descending sequence. Out of these flimsy materials, Beethoven builds his powerful triple fugue.

The themes are presented in a variety of harmonies, contexts, lights and shades, and by using the traditional fugal techniques of inversion and stretto. About two thirds through, a fortissimo climax is reached and, following a pause, there begins a contrasting pianissimo section with a constantly hurrying figure serving as the third fugal subject. Eventually, the original two themes of the fugue burst out loudly again and the work races impetuously toward its final climax, a crashing chord and a grand sweep of arpeggios twice down and up the entire keyboard.

The transition to the sublime minuet that forms the final variation is a series of quiet, greatly prolonged chords that achieve an extraordinary effect. In Solomon&#x27;s words, &quot;The thirty-third variation is introduced by a Poco adagio that breaks the fugue&#x27;s agitated momentum and finally takes us to the brink of utter motionlessness, providing a curtain to separate the fugue from the minuet.&quot; In describing the ending, commentators are often driven to superlatives. Gerald Abraham calls it &quot;one of the strangest passages Beethoven ever wrote&quot;. Kinderman describes the transition as &quot;one of the most magical moments in the work&quot;:

Tovey&#x27;s description of this dramatic moment is:

Technically, von Bülow admires in the closing four bars &quot;the principle of modulation chiefly developed in the master&#x27;s last creative period ... the successive step-wise progression of the several parts while employing enharmonic modulation as a bridge to connect even the remotest tonalities.&quot;

Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;To Handel&quot;.

===Variation 33: &quot;Tempo di Menuetto moderato&quot;===

Tovey comments:

Brendel&#x27;s title for this variation is &quot;To Mozart; to Beethoven&quot; explaining:

Solomon describes the closing bars as &quot;the final image – of a tender, songful, profound nostalgia, a vantage point from which we can review the purposes of the entire journey.&quot;

<doc id="157941" wikidata="Q1202868" url="?curid=157941" title="Genetic fallacy">
<text>The genetic fallacy (also known as the fallacy of origins or fallacy of virtue) is a fallacy of irrelevance in which arguments or information are dismissed or validated based solely on their source of origin rather than their content. In other words, a claim is ignored or given credibility based on its source rather than the claim itself.

The fallacy therefore fails to assess the claim on its merit. The first criterion of a good argument is that the premises must have bearing on the truth or falsity of the claim in question. Genetic accounts of an issue may be true and may help illuminate the reasons why the issue has assumed its present form, but they are not conclusive in determining its merits.

In &quot;The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&quot; (1995), it is asserted that the term originated in Morris Raphael Cohen and Ernest Nagel&#x27;s book &quot;Logic and Scientific Method&quot; (1934). However, in a book review published in &quot;The Nation&quot; in 1926, Mortimer J. Adler complained that &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot; by Will Durant was guilty throughout of &quot;the fallacy of genetic interpretation.&quot; Adler characterized the genetic fallacy generally as &quot;the substitution of psychology for logic.&quot;

==Examples==

From &quot;Attacking Faulty Reasoning&quot; by T. Edward Damer, Third Edition  36:
There are numerous motives explaining why people choose to wear wedding rings, but it would be a fallacy to presume those who continue the tradition are promoting sexism.

Another example would be from &quot;How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic&quot; (2006) by Madsen Pirie, p. 82:

As the author points out, private developers may well have legitimate and knowledgeable opinions on such a matter.

<doc id="157943" wikidata="Q490381" url="?curid=157943" title="Michael Haydn">
<text>Johann Michael Haydn (; 14 September 1737 – 10 August 1806) was an Austrian composer of the Classical period, the younger brother of Joseph Haydn.

==Life==
Michael Haydn was born in 1737 in the Austrian village of Rohrau, near the Hungarian border. His father was Mathias Haydn, a wheelwright who also served as &quot;Marktrichter&quot;, an office akin to village mayor. Haydn&#x27;s mother Maria, Koller, had previously worked as a cook in the palace of Count Harrach, the presiding aristocrat of Rohrau. Mathias was an enthusiastic folk musician, who during the journeyman period of his career had taught himself to play the harp, and he also made sure that his children learned to sing.

Michael went to Vienna at the age of eight, his early professional career path being paved by his older brother Joseph, whose skillful singing had landed him a position as a boy soprano in the St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Vienna choir under the direction of Georg Reutter, as were Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and Franz Joseph Aumann, both composers with whom Haydn later traded manuscripts. By Michael&#x27;s 12th birthday he was earning extra money as a substitute organist at the cathedral and had, reportedly, performed preludes and fantasies of his own composition. The early 19th-century author Albert Christoph Dies, based on Joseph&#x27;s late-life reminiscences, wrote:

Reutter was so captivated by [Joseph]&#x27;s talents that he declared to his father that even if he had twelve sons he would take care of them all. The father saw himself freed of a great burden by this offer, consented to it, and some five years after dedicated Joseph&#x27;s brothers Michael, and still later Johann to the musical muse. Both were taken on as choirboys, and, to Joseph&#x27;s unending joy, both brothers were turned over to him to be trained.

The same source indicates that Michael was a brighter student than Joseph, and that (particularly when Joseph had grown enough to have trouble keeping his soprano voice) it was Michael&#x27;s singing that was the more admired.

About 1753, he left the choir school because of the breaking of his voice. In 1760 Michael was appointed Kapellmeister at Großwardein (today Oradea) and later, in 1762, was appointed concertmaster at Salzburg, where he remained for 44 years, during which he wrote over 360 compositions comprising both church and instrumental music. From their mutual sojourn in Salzburg, Haydn was acquainted with Mozart, who held his work in high esteem.

On 17 August 1768 he married singer Maria Magdalena Lipp (1745–1827); their only child, a daughter (Aloisia Josepha, born 31 January 1770) died just short of her first birthday, on 27 January 1771. Although Lipp was disliked by the women in Mozart&#x27;s family for some reason, she still created the role of &quot;&quot; ([Divine] Mercy) in Mozart&#x27;s first musical play, &quot;Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots&quot; (&quot;The Obligation of the First Commandment&quot;), 1767, and later the role of Tamiri in his short pastoral opera &quot;Il re pastore&quot; of 1775.

Leopold Mozart, along with Wolfgang, criticized Haydn&#x27;s drinking habits.

In Salzburg Haydn taught young Carl Maria von Weber and Anton Diabelli.
Michael remained close to Joseph all of his life. Joseph regarded his brother&#x27;s music highly, to the point of feeling Michael&#x27;s religious works were superior to his own (possibly for their devotional intimacy, as opposed to Joseph&#x27;s monumental and majestic, more secularized, symphonic style). In 1802, when Michael was &quot;offered lucrative and honourable positions&quot; by &quot;both Esterházy and the Grand Duke of Tuscany,&quot; he wrote to Joseph in Vienna asking for advice on whether or not to accept either of them, but in the end chose to stay in Salzburg. Michael and Maria Magdalena Haydn named their daughter Aloisia Josepha not in honor of Michael&#x27;s brother, but after Josepha Daubrawa von Daubrawaick, who substituted as godmother at the baptism for Countess de Firmian.

He died in Salzburg at the age of 68.

==Works==
Musicologist Karl Geiringer has claimed that Michael Haydn has not received the recognition he deserves from posterity, taking the view that his church music, his choruses for male voices, and many of his instrumental works are on a respectable level and ought to be revived.

Michael Haydn never compiled a thematic catalog of his works, nor did he ever supervise the making of one. The earliest catalog was compiled in 1808 by Nikolaus Lang for his &#x27;Biographische Skizze&#x27; (Biographical Sketch). In 1907 Lothar Perger compiled a catalogue of his orchestral works, the Perger-Verzeichnis, for &quot;Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich&quot;, which is somewhat more reliable than Lang&#x27;s catalog and attaches P. (for Perger) numbers to many of Haydn&#x27;s instrumental works. And in 1915 Anton Maria Klafsky undertook a similar work for Michael&#x27;s sacred vocal music. In 1982, Charles H. Sherman, who has edited scores of many of his symphonies for Doblinger, published a chronological catalog of them which some recording companies have adopted. Later, in 1991, Sherman joined forces with T. Donley Thomas to publish a chronological catalog of Michael&#x27;s complete works using a single continuous range of numbers after Ludwig Ritter von Köchel&#x27;s pioneering catalog of all Mozart&#x27;s works and Otto Erich Deutsch&#x27;s similar comprehensive compendium for all Schubert&#x27;s works. Further important amendments to the Sherman/Thomas catalogue have been made by Dwight Blazin.

The task of cataloging Michael&#x27;s music is made easier by the fact that he almost always entered the date of completion on his manuscripts. Guesswork as to date was necessary only where autograph manuscripts did not survive.
Haydn&#x27;s sacred choral works are generally regarded as his most important; his musical taste and skill showed themselves best in his church compositions, which were already in his lifetime regarded as old-fashioned. Some of these works include the &quot;Requiem pro defuncto Archiepiscopo Sigismundo&quot; (Requiem for the death of Archbishop Siegmund) in C minor, which greatly influenced the &quot;Requiem&quot; by Mozart; &quot;Missa Hispanica&quot; (which he exchanged for a diploma at Stockholm); his magnificent last St. Francis Mass in D minor; the motet &quot;Lauda Sion&quot; which he wished to have sung at his funeral; and a set of graduals, forty-two of which are reprinted in Anton Diabelli&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiasticon&quot;. He wrote several settings of the mass ordinary in German by Franz Seraph von Kohlbrenner, named &quot;Deutsches Hochamt&quot;.

Haydn was also a prolific composer of secular music, including 41 symphonies and wind partitas, and multiple concertos and chamber music including a string quintet in C major once thought to have been by his brother Joseph. There was another case of posthumous mistaken identity involving Michael Haydn: for many years, the G major symphony now known to be Michael Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 25 was thought to be Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 37 and assigned as K. 444. The confusion arose because an autograph was discovered with the opening movement of the symphony in Mozart&#x27;s hand and the rest in another&#x27;s hand. It is now known that Mozart composed the slow introduction to the first movement but the rest of the work is by Michael.

Several of Michael Haydn&#x27;s works influenced Mozart. Three examples are first, the &quot;Te Deum&quot; &quot;which Wolfgang was later to follow very closely in K. 141&quot;; secondly the finale of the Symphony No. 23 which influenced the finale of the G major Quartet, K. 387; and lastly the (fugal) transition and (non-fugal) closing theme of the G major second subject expositions of the finales of both Michael&#x27;s Symphony No. 28 (1784) and Mozart&#x27;s monumental last Symphony No. 41 (&quot;Jupiter&quot;) (1788), both in C major.

<doc id="157946" wikidata="Q1247283" url="?curid=157946" title="Winter of Discontent">
<text>The Winter of Discontent was the period between late September 1978 and February 1979 in the United Kingdom characterised by widespread strikes by private, and later public, sector trade unions demanding pay rises greater than the limits Prime Minister James Callaghan and his Labour Party government had been imposing, against Trades Union Congress (TUC) opposition, to control inflation. Some of these industrial disputes caused great public inconvenience, exacerbated by the coldest winter in 16 years, in which severe storms isolated many remote areas of the country.

A strike by workers at Ford in late 1978 was settled with a pay increase of 17 per cent, well above the 5 per cent limit the government was holding its own workers to with the intent of setting an example for the private sector to follow, after a resolution at the Labour Party&#x27;s annual conference urging the government not to intervene passed overwhelmingly. At the end of the year a road hauliers&#x27; strike began, coupled with a severe storm as 1979 began. Later in the month many public workers followed suit as well. These actions included an unofficial strike by gravediggers working in Liverpool and Tameside, and strikes by refuse collectors, leaving uncollected rubbish on streets and in public spaces, including London&#x27;s Leicester Square. Additionally, NHS ancillary workers formed picket lines to blockade hospital entrances with the result that many hospitals were reduced to taking emergency patients only.

The unrest had deeper causes besides resentment of the caps on pay rises. Labour&#x27;s internal divisions over its commitment to socialism, manifested in disputes over labour law reform and macroeconomic strategy during the 1960s and early 1970s, pitted constituency members against the party&#x27;s establishment. Many of the strikes were initiated at the local level, with national union leaders largely unable to stop them. Union membership, particularly in the public sector, had grown more female and less white, and the growth of the public sector unions had not brought them a commensurate share of power within the TUC.

After Callaghan returned from a summit conference in the tropics at a time when the hauliers&#x27; strike and the weather had seriously disrupted the economy, leading thousands to apply for unemployment benefits, his denial that there was &quot;mounting chaos&quot; in the country was paraphrased in a famous &quot;Sun&quot; headline as &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s acknowledgement of the severity of the situation in a party political broadcast a week later was seen as instrumental to her victory in the general election held four months later after Callaghan&#x27;s government fell to a no-confidence vote. Once in power, the Conservatives, who under Thatcher&#x27;s leadership had begun criticising the unions as too powerful, passed legislation, similar to that proposed in a Labour white paper a decade earlier, that banned many practices, such as secondary picketing, that had magnified the effects of the strikes. Thatcher, and later other Conservatives like Boris Johnson, have continued to invoke the Winter of Discontent in election campaigns; it would be 18 years until another Labour government took power. In the late 2010s, after further Labour defeats, some British leftists argued that this narrative about the Winter of Discontent was inaccurate, and that policy in subsequent decades was much more harmful to Britain.

The term &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot; is taken from the opening line of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;.
It is credited to Larry Lamb, then editor at &quot;The Sun&quot;, in an editorial on 3 May 1979.

==Background==

The Winter of Discontent was driven by a combination of different social, economic and political factors which had been developing for over a decade.

===Divisions in Labour Party over macroeconomic strategy===

Under the influence of Anthony Crosland, a member of the more moderate Gaitskellite wing of the Labour Party in the 1950s, the party establishment came to embrace a more moderate course of action than it had in its earlier years before the war. Crosland had argued in his book &quot;The Future of Socialism&quot; that the government exerted enough control over private industry that it was not necessary to nationalise it as the party had long called to do, and that the ultimate goals of socialism could be as readily achieved by assuring long-term economic stability and building out the social welfare state. His &quot;revisionist&quot; views became Labour&#x27;s perspective on the post-war consensus, in which both they and the Conservative Party agreed in principle on a strong government role in the economy, strong unions and a welfare state as foundational to Britain&#x27;s prosperity.

In the 1970s, following the surge in radical left-wing politics of the late 1960s, that view was challenged in another Labour figure&#x27;s book, Stuart Holland&#x27;s &quot;The Socialist Challenge&quot;. He argued that contrary to Crosland&#x27;s assertions, the government could exercise little control over Britain&#x27;s largest companies, which were likely to continue consolidating into an oligopoly that, by the 1980s, could raise prices high enough that governments following Keynesian economics would be unable to ensure their citizens the opportunity for full employment that they had been able to since the war, and exploit transfer pricing to avoid paying British taxes. Holland called for returning to nationalisation, arguing that taking control of the top 25 companies that way would result in a market with more competition and less inflation.

Holland&#x27;s ideas formed the basis of the Alternative Economic Strategy (AES) promoted by Tony Benn, then Secretary of State for Industry in the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan as they considered responses to the 1976 sterling crisis. The AES called on Britain to adopt a protectionist stance in international trade, including reversing its recent decision to join the European Common Market, and impose no incomes policies to combat inflation. Benn believed that this approach was more in keeping with Labour&#x27;s traditional policies and would have its strongest supporters in the unions, with them vigorously supporting the government against opposition from the financial sector and &quot;commanding heights&quot; of industry. It was ultimately rejected in favour of the social contract and extensive cuts in public spending as the condition of an International Monetary Fund loan that supported the pound after the sterling crisis.

The left wing of the Labour Party, while critical of the revisionist approach and the Social Contract, was not universally supportive of the AES either. Many thought it did not go far enough, or avoided the issue of nationalisation. Feminists in particular criticised it for its focus on traditionally male-dominated manufacturing jobs and ignoring the broader issues that the increasing number of women in the workforce faced, preferring a focus on broader social issues rather than just working conditions and pay, the traditional areas unions had negotiated with employers.

===1960s–70s labour law reforms===

In 1968 Wilson&#x27;s government appointed the Donovan Commission to review British labour law with an eye toward reducing the days lost to strikes every year; many Britons had come to believe the unions were too powerful despite the country&#x27;s economic growth since the war. It found much of the problem to lie in a parallel system of &#x27;official&#x27; signed agreements between unions and employers, and &#x27;unofficial&#x27;, often unwritten ones at the local level, between shop stewards and managers, which often took precedence in practice over the official ones. The government responded with &quot;In Place of Strife&quot;, a white paper by Secretary of State for Employment Barbara Castle, which recommended restrictions on unions&#x27; ability to strike, such as requiring strikes take place after a member vote and fining unions for unofficial strikes.

The Trades Union Congress (TUC) vigorously opposed making Castle&#x27;s recommendations law, and Callaghan, then Home Secretary, led a cabinet revolt which led to its abandonment. Callaghan did not believe it would be effective in curtailing unofficial strikes, that the proposals could not pass, and the effort would create unnecessary tension between the government and the unions that were key to its political strength.

After the Conservatives won the following year&#x27;s election, they implemented their own legislation to address the issue. The Industrial Relations Act 1971, modeled in part on the U.S. Taft-Hartley Act, passed over determined union opposition, included many of the same provisions as &quot;In Place of Strife&quot;, and explicitly stated that formal collective bargaining agreements would have the force of law unless they had disclaimers to the contrary. It also created a National Industrial Relations Court to handle disputes and put unions under a central registry to enforce their rules.

New Prime Minister Edward Heath hoped that the new law would not only address the strike issue but the steep inflation plaguing the British economy (along with other industrial capitalist economies) at the time, eliminating the need for a separate incomes policy by having a moderating effect on pay increases demanded by unions. Ongoing union resistance to the Industrial Relations Act led to a House of Lords ruling in their favor over demonstrations and widespread unofficial strikes following the Pentonville Five&#x27;s imprisonment for continuing to picket a London container depot in violation of a court order, which undermined the legislation. Coal miners officially went on strike for the first time in almost half a century in 1972; after two months the strike was settled with the miners getting a 21 per cent increase, less than half of what they had originally sought.

Heath turned to an incomes policy; inflation continued to worsen. The incomes policy was abandoned in 1973 when that year&#x27;s oil embargo nearly doubled prices within months. To meet demand for heat in the wintertime, the government had to return to coal, giving the National Union of Mineworkers more leverage. The government declared a state of emergency that November, and at the beginning of 1974 limited all nonessential businesses to three days of electricity each week to conserve power. Miners, who had seen their rise from two years before turn into a pay cut in real terms due to the inflation the government had not brought under control, voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in late January.

Two weeks later, the government responded by calling an election, running on the slogan &quot;Who Governs Britain?&quot;. At the end of the month the Conservatives no longer did; Labour and Wilson returned, but without a majority. They were able to pass the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which repealed the Heath government&#x27;s Industrial Relations Act.

In October Wilson won a majority of three seats; still they needed a coalition with the Liberal Party to have a majority on many issues. Callaghan, now Foreign Secretary, attended an informal meeting at Chequers alongside his fellow Cabinet members, where he speculated about the possibility of &quot;...[a] breakdown of democracy&quot;, joking with them that &quot;[i]f I were a young man, I would emigrate.&quot;

===Incomes policy===

Wilson, and Callaghan, who succeeded him as prime minister after Wilson resigned for health reasons in 1976, continued to fight inflation, which peaked at 26.9 per cent in the 12 months to August 1975. While demonstrating to markets fiscal responsibility the government wished to avoid large increases in unemployment. As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a &quot;Social Contract&quot; with the TUC which allowed for a voluntary incomes policy in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by Acts of Parliament, but the Social Contract agreed that this would not happen.

====Phases I and II====
Phase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a white paper entitled &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot;. This proposed a limit on wage rises of £6 per week for all earning below £8,500 annually. The TUC General Council accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between £2.50 and £4 per week with further years outlined. At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free collective bargaining (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.

====Phase III====
On 15 July 1977, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without &quot;a free-for-all&quot;. After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977–78 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The Conservative Party criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate was below 10 per cent.

At the end of the year Bernard Donoughue, Callaghan&#x27;s chief policy advisor, sent him a memo analysing possible election dates. He concluded that the following October or November would be the best option, as the economy was likely to remain in good shape through then. After that, he wrote, the outlook was unclear, with pressure from the government&#x27;s own incomes policy likely.

====Five per cent limit====
At a May 1978 Downing Street lunch with editors and reporters from the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Callaghan asked if they believed it was possible that the planned Phase IV would succeed, as he believed it would if the unions and their members understood it was the best way to keep Labour in power. Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. Geoffrey Goodman disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. &quot;If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members—and the voters&quot;, the prime minister responded. &quot;We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.&quot;

On 21 July 1978 Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey introduced a new white paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5 per cent in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures; however, trade union leaders warned the government that the 5 per cent limit was unachievable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8 per cent. Terry Duffy, president of the AUEW, described the limit as &#x27;political suicide&#x27;. Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to free collective bargaining as they were promised.

It had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the autumn, and that the 5 per cent limit would be revised if Labour won. At a private dinner before that year&#x27;s TUC conference, Callaghan discussed election strategy with the leaders of major unions. He asked whether he should call an autumn election; with the exception of Scanlon they all urged him to call for one no later than November. Any later, they said, and they could not guarantee their memberships would remain on the job and off the picket line through the winter.

Unexpectedly, however, on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5 per cent limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed &quot;Phase IV&quot; but most referred to it as &quot;the 5 per cent limit&quot;. Although the government did not make the 5 per cent limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.

===Changes in labour movement===

Between 1966 and 1979, Britain&#x27;s unions were changing and becoming more diverse. Most of the increase in union membership was driven by women returning to or entering the workforce—73 per cent of them joined a union during that period against 19.3 per cent of men newly in work, as manufacturing jobs, traditionally heavily male, disappeared. Black and Asian workers also filled union ranks; in 1977, 61 per cent of black men in work belonged to a union as opposed to 47 per cent of white men. Asian women became the face of the labour movement during the 1976–1978 Grunwick dispute over pay and conditions at a film processing plant in suburban London.

Within unions, power was also devolving to the rank and file. The political upheavals of the late 1960s in Europe and the United States had brought participatory democracy to the fore, and workers felt they should be taking decisions, including about when and whether to strike, that had hitherto been the province of union leadership. Hugh Scanlon, who took over as head of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers (AUEW) in 1967, and Jack Jones, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (TGWU) from shortly afterwards, were known among union leaders as &quot;the dubious duo&quot; for their advocacy for devolution.

====Dissatisfied public employees====

Many new members were also coming from government jobs. In 1974, about half of the total British workforce was unionised, but 83.1 per cent of all public-sector workers were. In the health sector that reached 90 per cent. Many of the government workers joining unions were women.

The public employees were in a particularly difficult position with regard to incomes policy. Governments kept their employees&#x27; pay, already lower than their private-sector colleagues, low both because they could and because they wanted to set an example for the private sector, an example the private sector rarely followed. Their unions were also frustrated that their growing numbers had not yet translated into corresponding influence within the TUC.

These matters came to a head with the 1977 fire brigade strike, a strike that many firemen were conflicted about since they knew they would be abandoning their own profession&#x27;s duty to protect life, but felt that they could no longer make ends meet with their pay packets. They asked for a 30 per cent increase, 20 per cent over the government&#x27;s limit at the time, and a limit to 42 hours of work each week. The government responded by declaring a state of emergency and bringing in Army troops as replacements. The TUC voted late in the strike to not campaign in support of the firemen, in order to maintain its relationship with the government.

===&quot;Stepping Stones&quot; and hardening of Conservative position on unionism===

Margaret Thatcher was elected Conservative leader to succeed Heath in 1975. She had been known as a member of his Cabinet, where she served as Secretary of State for Education, for her advocacy of market-based solutions over government intervention in the economy, and had become convinced, as she wrote later, by that experience that the only thing more damaging to the British economy than Labour&#x27;s socialist policies was her own party&#x27;s attempts to emulate them. Influenced by writers such as Friedrich Hayek and Colm Brogan, she came to believe the power of British unions under the postwar consensus had come at the expense of Britain as a whole.

In 1977 two of her advisors, John Hoskyns and Norman Strauss, prepared a report called &quot;Stepping Stones&quot; which diagrammed the vicious cycle through which they believed the unions&#x27; influence exacerbated Britain&#x27;s ongoing economic difficulties, such as unemployment and inflation. Thatcher made it available to her shadow cabinet with the authors&#x27; recommendation that they all read it. By the end of the year she had formed a steering group to develop a specific policy aimed at curbing union power under a Tory government, and a media strategy that would invest the public in this.

To implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, whose 1978 &quot;Labour Isn&#x27;t Working&quot; campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year. In 1978 Britain&#x27;s largest tabloid, &quot;The Sun&quot;, dropped its longtime support for Labour to instead embrace the Tories. Editor Larry Lamb met frequently with Thatcher&#x27;s media advisor Gordon Reece to plan and refine strategy. During the later phases of the Grunwick dispute, as strikers took to the streets to march and sometimes clashed violently with the police, the Tories began using the media coverage to leverage the critique of unionism contained in &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;.

==Ford negotiations==
Although not an official guideline, the pay rise set by Ford of Britain was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations. Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers. The company was, however, also a major government contractor. Ford&#x27;s management therefore made a pay offer within the 5 per cent guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October. The number of participants grew to 57,000. The strike prevented the production of 115,000 vehicles which cost Ford around $885 million.

During the strike, Vauxhall Motors employees accepted an 8.5 per cent rise. After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17 per cent and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.

==Political difficulties==
As the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at Blackpool. Terry Duffy, the delegate from Liverpool Wavertree Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the Militant group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded &quot;that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations&quot;. Despite a plea from Michael Foot not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying &quot;I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday&quot;, but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.

Meanwhile, the government&#x27;s situation in the House of Commons was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a pact with the Liberal Party in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978. A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to Northern Ireland afforded temporary support from the Ulster Unionist Party, but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the bill to grant extra seats had been passed – it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a motion of no confidence by 312 to 300 on 9 November.

===Further negotiation at the TUC===
By the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5 per cent limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14–14, with the formula being rejected on the chair&#x27;s casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with Moss Evans replacing Jack Jones at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.

After Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the Confederation of British Industry which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however, on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5 per cent limit on private industry.

==Onset of severe winter weather==

A mild autumn turned cold on the morning of 25 November when temperatures recorded at Heathrow Airport dropped from to overnight, with some snowflakes. Throughout most of the following month, the cold lingered, only for temperatures to rise well above around Christmas. On 30 December, the temperature dropped again, along with rain that soon turned to snow; the next day 1978 ended with Heathrow recording a high of only amid steady snowfall.

The effects were more severe outside of London. Ilfracombe and other towns in North Devon could only be reached by helicopter as many roads could not be adequately cleared. The Royal Automobile Club blamed local councils, who in turn pointed to unresolved issues with their unions and staff shortages; even around London local authorities were only able to clear main roads. Two Scottish trains near Stirling were stuck in the snow, leaving 300 passengers stranded; rail transport difficulties were exacerbated elsewhere in the country by a strike. Tanker drivers had also gone on strike in some areas from 18 December, causing some homeowners to have difficulties keeping their homes heated and limiting petrol supplies. Only three League football matches could take place over the New Year&#x27;s holiday, and all rugby contests were cancelled. Three men drowned after falling through the ice on the Hampstead Heath pond in London.

==Lorry drivers&#x27; strike==
With the government now having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. Lorry drivers, represented by the TGWU, had demanded rises of up to 40 per cent on 18 December; years of expansion in the industry had left employers short of drivers, and those drivers who had jobs often worked 70–80 hours a week for minimal pay. The Road Haulage Association (RHA), the industry trade group, had initially told Secretary of State for Transport William Rodgers, a member of the Labour Party&#x27;s right wing who had become sceptical of the public&#x27;s appetite for the completion of the party&#x27;s socialist programme, that it would stay within the 5 per cent ceiling. But as 1979 began, the RHA, whom Rodgers saw as disorganised and easily intimidated by the TGWU, suddenly increased its offer to 13 per cent, in hopes of settling before strikes became widespread.

The offer had the opposite effect. Drivers, emboldened by memories of a strike the previous winter by South Wales hauliers that won participants a 20 per cent rise, decided they could do better by walking out. The union&#x27;s national leadership was, as they had anticipated in their September dinner with Callaghan, doubtful they could restrain the local leaders. On 2 January Rodgers warned the Cabinet that a national road-haulage strike was about to happen, but cautioned against pressuring the RHA to improve their offer even more.

The next day an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also picketed the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80 per cent of the nation&#x27;s goods transported by road, and roads still not completely cleared from the earlier storm, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.

In Kingston upon Hull, striking hauliers were able to blockade the city&#x27;s two main roads effectively enough to control what goods were allowed into and out of the city, and companies made their case to their own nominal employees to get past the barricades. Newspaper headlines likened the situation to a siege, and the Battle of Stalingrad; fears that food supplies would also be impacted fuelled panic buying. Such coverage often exaggerated the reach of the strikers, which served both their interest and their employers&#x27;. It also helped the Conservatives disseminate the arguments of &quot;Stepping Stones&quot; about unionism out of control to the public; letters to the editor across the country reflected a growing public anger with the unions.

Due to the disruption of fuel supplies, the Cabinet Office prepared to implement previous plans for &quot;Operation Drumstick&quot;, by which the Army were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a state of emergency in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step on 18 January. Rodgers in particular was opposed to it, since the available troops could at best only make up for a very small portion of the striking drivers, and it might be possible to use them more effectively without declaring an emergency. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.

The Cabinet also decided that same day that it would not take action to limit any hauling company&#x27;s profits, thereby allowing them to increase their offer to the strikers. Rodgers was so disheartened by this that he wrote a resignation letter to Callaghan, saying &quot;the Government is not even in the front line&quot; and accusing it of &quot;defeatism of a most reprehensible kind&quot;. He ultimately decided to remain in the Cabinet.

A further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting on 12 January 1979 a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established &quot;dispensation committees&quot; to decide. When strikers in Hull did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken&#x27;s necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.

Demonstrations against the strike took place in Liverpool and Manchester, met by counterdemonstrations in support. In Birmingham, violence erupted on 17 January when three hundred women working at the Cadbury Schweppes plant in Bournville heard that a flying picket was moving into place to attempt to block a delivery. Swinging their handbags and umbrellas, they quickly drove away the striking lorry drivers, whom they outnumbered by twenty to one. The incident made national news.

Some hauliers attempted to return to work without waiting for an offer. A group in the Shropshire town of Oakengates organised a convoy, but it was unable to leave town as the ungritted roads proved too slippery to drive.

On 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an arbitration panel of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just £1 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.

After the drivers returned to work, some media outlets took a second look at the shortages and found that they had been more a matter of fear than reality. &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that many predicted shortages of foods had not actually taken place. Douglas Smith of the Employment Department recalled years later that he only recalled certain breakfast cereals being out of stock, and Rodgers, too, agreed that the job losses had not been as severe as they seemed they would be. But the fears of disruption had had an impact on the national mood even if little of what was feared had actually come to pass.

==Media response by Callaghan and Thatcher==

===&quot;Crisis? What crisis?&quot;===

While Britain was dealing with the strike and the aftermath of the storm, Callaghan was in the Caribbean, attending a summit in Guadeloupe with U.S. President Jimmy Carter, German chancellor Helmut Schmidt and French president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing discussing the growing crisis in Iran and the proposed SALT II arms control treaty with the Soviet Union. He also spent a few days afterwards on holiday in Barbados, where he was photographed by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; wearing a bathing suit and swimming in the sun. The newspaper used the images at the end of a lengthy leader lamenting the state of affairs in Britain.

On 10 January, as the temperature climbed above freezing in southern and low-lying areas of Britain for the first time since the storm, Callaghan returned. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser Tom McNally thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at Heathrow Airport. To McNally&#x27;s dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. On his first questions he was asked about the situation in Britain; he responded by angrily suggesting the press had exaggerated matters and perhaps did not truly love their country. McNally was chagrined; this was not how he had expected things to go.

Callaghan was then asked (by a reporter from the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;), &quot;What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?&quot; and replied:

The next day&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Sun&quot; headlined its story &quot;Crisis? What crisis?&quot; with a subheading &quot;Rail, lorry, jobs chaos – and Jim blames Press&quot;, condemning Callaghan as being &quot;out of touch&quot; with British society. The phrase &quot;Crisis? What crisis?&quot; had entered public consciousness in the 1973 film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; and had been further popularized by Supertramp&#x27;s 1975 album of the same name.

While he had never used those exact words, Callaghan&#x27;s speechwriter Roger Carroll agreed they were an effective paraphrase. &quot;He asked for it, I&#x27;m afraid, and he got it.&quot; Callaghan would be closely associated with the phrase for the rest of his life.

===Conservative response===

Thatcher, the Leader of the Opposition, had been calling for the government to declare a state of emergency to deal with the strike during the first week of January. She also called for the immediate enactment of reforms that &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;, and before it &quot;In Place of Strife&quot; had proposed: a ban on secondary picketing of third-party businesses not targeted directly by a strike, ending closed shop contracts under which employers can only hire those already members of a union, requiring votes by secret ballot before strikes and in the elections of union officials, and securing no-strike agreements with public-sector unions that provided vital public services, such as fire, health care and utilities.

A week later, as the cold returned and Britons had begun filing claims for unemployment benefit by the thousands, Thatcher addressed the situation in a party political broadcast. From a small sitting room she spoke, she said, not as a politician but as a Briton. &quot;Tonight I don&#x27;t propose to use the time to make party political points&quot;, she told viewers. &quot;I do not think you would want me to do so. The crisis that our country faces is too serious for that.&quot;

The disruptions caused by the strikes had led Thatcher to &quot;wonder what has happened to our sense of common nationhood and even of common humanity&quot;. She traced those to the unions&#x27; broad abilities to picket and strike, allowing almost any of them to &quot;strangle the country&quot;. Most unionists, she allowed, did not support such extreme tactics.

===Labour response===

In its own party broadcast on 24 January, Labour ignored the situation entirely. Instead, a Manchester city councillor argued for increasing council housing in his city. Party members privately expressed great disappointment with Callaghan and his Cabinet for both failing to seize a crucial opportunity to win over the public and continuing to downplay the severity of the crisis. &quot;How do you think that we the Party workers are going to go out and seek support from the public if this is the best you people can do at Transport House?&quot; wrote one.

==Public sector employees==

Bitter winter weather returned after a week of milder temperatures on 22 January. Freezing rain began falling across England at noon; by midnight temperatures dropped further and it turned to snow, which continued falling into the next day. Once again roads were impassable in the south; in the north and at higher elevations areas that had not yet recovered from the storm three weeks prior were newly afflicted.

A month earlier the public sector unions had set that day as the biggest individual day of strike action since the General Strike of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards. With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to ASLEF and the National Union of Railwaymen had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the Royal College of Nursing conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise. The public sector unions labelled the date the &quot;Day of Action&quot;, in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a £60 per week minimum wage. It would later be recalled as &quot;Misery Monday&quot; by the media.

With the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action – often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, Cardiff, Glasgow and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike. On 30 January, the Secretary of State for Social Services David Ennals announced that 1,100 of 2,300 NHS hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that cancer patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.

===Gravediggers&#x27; strike===

At a strike committee meeting in the Liverpool area earlier in January, it was reported that although local binmen were supportive of the strike, they did not want to be the first to do so as they had always been. The committee then asked Ian Lowes, convener for the General and Municipal Workers&#x27; Union (GMWU) local, to have the gravediggers and crematorium workers he represented take the lead instead. He accepted, as long as the other unions followed; and the GMWU&#x27;s national executive approved the strike.

Those unions had never gone on strike before, Lowes recalled in 2006, and he had not expected that permission to be granted. &quot;I knew how the press was going to latch on to it,&quot; he said, &quot;and they totally underestimated the venom that headed our way.&quot; Larry Whitty, an executive official with the union, also agreed later that it had been a mistake to approve the strike. The GMWU at the time was also known as the most conservative and least militant of the public employee unions; frequently it had used its influence within the Labour Party to frustrate left-wing challenges to the leadership, and its officials rarely faced contested elections for their positions. Faced with the growing threat from the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) and the Confederation of Health Service Employees, both of which were growing more quickly, it was trying not to be what members of those unions called the &#x27;scab union&#x27;.

The ensuing strike, in Liverpool and in Tameside near Manchester, was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians. With 80 gravediggers being on strike, Liverpool City Council hired a factory in Speke to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public. On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that burial at sea would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral&#x27;s graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies. The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks. Bolton later reported being &quot;horrified&quot; by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media. The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14 per cent rise after a fortnight off the job.

In their later memoirs, Callaghan and Healey both blamed NUPE for letting the strike go on as long as it did, as would Conservatives. While the Tameside gravediggers had been members of that union, those in the Liverpool area were GMWU.

===Waste collectors===
With many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled Westminster City Council used Leicester Square in the heart of London&#x27;s West End for piles of rubbish and, as the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reported, this attracted rats and the available food led to an increase in their numbers. The media nicknamed the area Fester Square.

On 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers&#x27; dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11 per cent rise, plus £1 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the London Borough of Camden, conceded the union demands in full (known as the &quot;Camden surplus&quot;) and then saw an investigation by the District Auditor, which eventually ruled it a breach of the fiduciary duty owed to the ratepayers (local taxpayers) of the area and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them Ken Livingstone, avoided surcharge. Livingstone was Leader of the Greater London Council at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.

==End of the strikes==

By the end of January 90,000 Britons were receiving unemployment benefit. There were no more major storms, but temperatures remained bitterly cold. Many remote communities still had not quite recovered from the snowstorm at the beginning of the month. A section of the M6 north of Walsall was closed to traffic, and many other roads, even near London, had enforced temporary speed limits as low as . Plans to have the Army grit the roads were abandoned when NUPE official Barry Shuttleworth threatened an expanded strike of public employees in response.

Strikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the Inland Revenue Staff Federation. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers &quot;free collective vandalism&quot;.

The government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to an agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February, as thaws in the weather began to seem possible, the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title &quot;The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities&quot;. By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.

Storms in late February prolonged the isolation of the remote communities where roads had not been cleared yet. January 1979, with an average temperature of , was the seventeenth coldest January since records began to be kept in 1659; in the years since only two other winter months in Britain (February 1986 and December 2010) have had average temperatures below freezing. The average for both January and February has not ever been equalled by another two-month period since. Overall, the winter of 1979 was the twenty-eighth coldest ever, but the third coldest of the 20th century.

==Effect on general election==

The strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to Gallup, Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on devolution to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40 per cent of that electorate. The government&#x27;s decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the Scottish National Party to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote, precipitating a general election.

Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a party political broadcast on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers&#x27; strike. During the election campaign the Conservative Party made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun&#x27;s headline &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives&#x27; victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their &quot;Labour Isn&#x27;t Working&quot; campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.

==Legacy==

Following Thatcher&#x27;s election win, she brought the post-war consensus to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the 1983 general election, which the Conservatives won by a landslide.

American historian Tara Martin López has noted how many later memories of the Winter of Discontent exaggerate what occurred and confuse events of that time with other industrial disputes and their consequences during the 1970s. In &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;, a 2000 documentary about punk rock band the Sex Pistols, surviving members Steve Jones and John Lydon recall 1975, around the time of the band&#x27;s founding, for &quot;a garbage strike that went on for years and years and there was trash piled ten-foot high&quot;. One of López&#x27;s own students in her classes at the University of Manchester identified the Winter of Discontent with the three-day week, which had actually been implemented during the 1974 miners&#x27; strike. She wrote: &quot;The embeddedness of a memory infused with a mix of errors, political fact and evocative images is particularly interesting in understanding the Winter of Discontent because it intimates the broader historical significance of this series of events.&quot;

===Within the Labour Party===

The Winter of Discontent also had effects within the Labour Party. Callaghan was succeeded as leader by the more left-wing Michael Foot, who did not succeed in unifying the party. In 1981, still believing the party to have been too firmly controlled by the unions, William Rodgers, the former transport minister who had tried to mitigate the effect of the hauliers&#x27; strike, left with three dozen other disaffected Labourites to form the more centrist Social Democratic Party (SDP), a decision he recalls reaching with some difficulty. Similarly disillusioned, especially after a GMWU official assured him &quot;we&#x27;ll call the shots&quot; after the winter ended, Tom McNally, Callaghan&#x27;s advisor who had recommended the news conference that produced &quot;The Sun&quot;″s &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; headline, left Labour for the SDP.

Some of the union officials involved, on the other hand, never changed their positions on the strikes. &quot;I would have to say if we had to do it all over again today, I would do it all over again&quot;, Rodney Bickerstaffe, later general secretary of NUPE and its successor UNISON, said in 2006. Ian Lowes, leader of the Liverpool gravediggers, concurred: &quot;We had no choice&quot;. After the strikes, feeling betrayed by government denunciations of the strikers, he, too, moved away from the Labour Party—but further left. He found himself agreeing with the Trotskyist positions of &quot;The Militant&quot; newspaper distributed to strikers, and soon formally joined the local branch of the Militant Tendency, leaving them six years later when the Liverpool City Council, controlled by Militant, followed local governments across Britain in contracting out work normally done by government workers.

During the 1997 general election, with the Tories the besieged incumbent party, Conservative campaign operatives began claiming that Labour, once back in power, would again take its direction from the TUC and repeal all the laws Thatcher had passed to curb the tactics unions had used in 1979. Labour leader Tony Blair wrote an opinion piece for &quot;The Times&quot; denying all those charges and explaining that Labour had no plans to allow unballoted strikes, secondary pickets or closed shops, among other things, again. &quot;I have staked my political reputation and credibility on making it clear that there will be no return to the 1970s&quot;, he wrote. &quot;Indeed there is little appetite among trade unions for such a thing.&quot;

===Response by the British left===

After Labour&#x27;s steep losses, including many seats the party had held for decades, in the 2019 election, during which Conservatives had again linked left-wing party leader Jeremy Corbyn to the 1970s and the Winter of Discontent, Matt Myers wrote in &quot;Jacobin&quot; that the British left had, by ceding to the right its narrative of that era, failed to confront &quot;neoliberalism&#x27;s founding myth, [which] continues to place a fundamental obstacle in the way of socialist advance in Britain ... The defeats of the 1970s have been internalized—even by those that had once been the most powerful counterforces to neoliberalism.&quot; This in his opinion came despite Labour&#x27;s hold on the youth vote, much more in its favour than it had been in 1983, when voters aged 18–24 preferred Thatcher. The corresponding overwhelming lead of the Tories among older voters, whom he described as &quot;passive beneficiaries of socialist transformation&quot;, in Labour&#x27;s view, rather than &quot;active subjects&quot; made it easy for the right to appeal to their desire to protect the much greater wealth they had accumulated compared to the country&#x27;s youth by evoking the 1970s.

Some leftists have joined the criticism of labour actions during the Winter of Discontent. Paul Foot, a lifelong socialist, described the strikes as &quot;bloody-minded expressions of revenge and self-interest&quot;. John Kelly, another left-leaning academic, wrote that they were &quot;an example of an almost purely economistic and defensive militancy&quot;.

Recognising the era&#x27;s endurance as an albatross around Labour&#x27;s neck, some leftists have attempted to rehabilitate the Winter of Discontent as the inevitable result of the Callaghan government&#x27;s incomes policy. &quot;[It] hardly fell out of a clear blue sky; rather, it was the culmination of a long series of strikes and struggles against drastic attacks on workers&#x27; standards of living&quot;, Sheila Cohen wrote for &quot;The Commune&quot; in 2010. &quot;Red Pepper&quot;, in a page on its website devoted to refuting the Tory narrative of the 1970s, echoes this and further blames the Bank of England&#x27;s loosening of credit restrictions during and after the Heath government as driving inflation so high, rather than union pay demands; it also attributes the economic rebound under Thatcher to the revenues from North Sea oil instead of her labour law reforms.

Cohen also saw the Winter as having offended the ruling class through its demonstration of working-class power. &quot;These prosaic struggles of tanker drivers, gravediggers and dustmen also displayed the only power that workers can have; they withdrew their labour, with a force and to an extent that seriously challenged the organisation and structure of society.&quot; Two years later, in the wake of the Great Recession and the austerity measures introduced by Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, who had succeeded Brown at the 2010 election, Nick Cohen was not so sure that the strikes of 1979, which he agreed were the last time the working class was able to inconvenience the wealthy, should be remembered so badly: &quot;With organised labour now emasculated, managers and owners can reward themselves without restraint and governments can stagger from blunder to blunder without a thought for those who must suffer the consequences.&quot;

===As 21st-century Conservative talking point===

In 2008, another &quot;Times&quot; piece raised the spectre of the Winter of Discontent in warning Labour, then in government with Gordon Brown as prime minister, not to allow the TUC to set the party&#x27;s agenda again. Militant union rhetoric at the party&#x27;s 2008 conference, Rachel Sylvester wrote, made it &quot;a quaint but rather pointless vision of the past: Jurassic Park with an Abba soundtrack, a T-rex dressed in flares.&quot; Five years later, at the first Margaret Thatcher Annual Lecture given after her death, Boris Johnson lamented that British youth were getting an overwhelmingly negative impression of the late prime minister from &quot;Russell Brand and the BBC&quot; that those old enough to remember what came before her election did not. &quot;[In 1979] Red Robbo [i.e. Derek Robinson] paralyzed what was left of our car industry and the country went into an ecstasy of uselessness called the winter of discontent: women were forced to give birth by candle-light, Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions was lit by paraffin lamp and Blue Peter was all about how to put newspaper in blankets for extra insulation.&quot; Two years later, with another election looming, Johnson again claimed that Ed Miliband, Labour&#x27;s then-leader, would take Britain back to the 1970s if he became prime minister.

After losing that election, Miliband was succeeded as Labour leader by Jeremy Corbyn, a surprise winner of the leadership election identified with the left wing of the party, who had been a NUPE activist before his election to Parliament in 1983; he was popular among younger voters. In the 2017 general election, the first contested with him as leader, the party did better than expected, gaining 30 seats, its first seat gains in 20 years. &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; columnist Philip Johnston attributed this to Conservatives&#x27; failure to use the Winter of Discontent against Corbyn as an example for his youthful base of what his policies would likely lead to a repeat of. &quot;It appears that the economic arguments we had as a nation in the Eighties will have to be joined all over again.&quot;

Two years later, in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Sean O&#x27;Grady recalled his experience of that winter, as a child. While conceding that some memories of it exaggerated its severity, &quot;[t]here was a mood in the country that we couldn&#x27;t carry on like this&quot; and thus Thatcher was elected. O&#x27;Grady warned readers that if reforms to labour laws that her government had enacted in the wake of the Winter of Discontent were repealed, in addition with the enactment of legislation desired by unions to make it easier to organize, Britain could see a repeat of 1979. &quot;We learned hard lessons about this sort of thing in that exceptionally cold and harsh winter of 1978–79&quot;, he wrote. &quot;Don&#x27;t let Britain have to learn those painful lessons again, the hard way.&quot;

<doc id="157953" wikidata="Q1760699" url="?curid=157953" title="Kol Nidre">
<text>Kol Nidre (also known as Kol Nidrei or Kol Nidrey; Aramaic: &quot;kāl niḏrē&quot;) is an Aramaic declaration which begins Yom Kippur services in the synagogue. Strictly speaking, it is not a prayer, even though it is commonly spoken of as if it were a prayer. This declaration and its ceremonial accompaniment have been charged with emotional undertones since the medieval period, creating a dramatic introduction to Yom Kippur on what is often dubbed &quot;Kol Nidrei night&quot;, with the entire Yom Kippur evening service popularly called &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot;.

The common text for &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; is written mostly in Aramaic, with one Hebrew phrase. However, the earliest known text of Kol Nidrei (&quot;Kol Nedarim&quot;), as it appears in the Siddur of Rav Amram Gaon, is in Hebrew; this text is used with minor changes by Italian rite and Romaniote Jews. Its name is taken from its opening words, which mean &quot;all vows&quot;. The formula, depending on rite, either proactively annuls any personal or religious oaths or prohibitions which are made between oneself and God in the course of the next year, so as to preemptively avoid the sin of breaking vows which are made to God but are not or cannot be upheld, or annuls any vows taken in the preceding year.

&quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; has had an eventful history, both in itself and in its influence on the legal status of the Jews. Introduced into the liturgy despite the opposition of rabbinic authorities, repeatedly attacked in the course of time by many halakhists, and in the nineteenth century expunged from the prayer-book by many communities of western Europe, it has often been employed by Christians to support their assertion that the oath of a Jew can not be trusted.

==Form of the ritual==
Before sunset on Yom Kippur eve, worshipers gather in the synagogue. The Ark is opened and in many communities some of the Sifrei Torah (Torah scrolls) are removed. A person stands on each side of the Hazzan (in some communities holding the Torah Scrolls), and the three (forming a beth din or rabbinical court) recite:
This invitation to outcasts is not specifically for Kol Nidre but for the whole of Yom Kippur, it being obvious that when even sinners join in repenting, the occasion is worthy of Divine clemency.

The cantor then chants the passage beginning with the words &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; with its touching melodic phrases, and, in varying intensities from pianissimo (quiet) to fortissimo (loud), repeats twice (for a total of three iterations) lest a latecomer not hear them. In the Italian and Romaniote rites, it is recited in Hebrew (&quot;Kol Nedarim&quot;, Hebrew: כל נדרים) instead of Aramaic. The following provides the traditional Aramaic text, which (except for the Hebrew insert connecting one Day of Atonement to another) is quite similar in the various rites, although there are minor differences between the Ashkenazic, Eastern Ashkenaz and Sephardic liturgies. The following text is the Eastern Ashkenazic text, reflecting the two customs of which year it is referring to (and those who combine the texts).

The leader and the congregation recite the verse &quot;May all the people of Israel be forgiven, including all the strangers who live in their midst, for all the people are in fault&quot; () three times. Different regional traditions have woven it into the recitation in various ways.

In the Eastern Ashkenazic rite, the leader then adds: &quot;O pardon the iniquities of this people, according to Thy abundant mercy, just as Thou forgave this people ever since they left Egypt.&quot; And then the leader and congregation say together three times, &quot;The Lord said, &#x27;I pardon them according to your words. (quoting ). The Torah scrolls are then put back in the Ark. In some communities there is a brief sermon at this point, and the Yom Kippur evening service begins.

According to some Kol Nidre must be recited before sunset, as it is a form of &quot;hatarat nedarim&quot; (annulment of vows), which, according to halakha, should not be performed on major holidays (of which Yom Kippur is one). However, according to the customs that recite Kol Nidrei for the following year (&quot;from this Day of Atonement until the [next] Day of Atonement that will come for our benefit&quot;), this would not constitute a &quot;hatarat nedarim&quot;, and it should be permitted on Yom Kippur itself.

==Origin and history==
The date of the composition of the declaration and its author are alike unknown, but it was in existence at the Geonic period (589–1038 CE). There was a common theory that it commenced during and because of a period of extreme persecution, in which Jews were forced at sword&#x27;s point to convert (either to Christianity or Islam) and that Kol Nidre would restore the person&#x27;s Jewish identity by nullifying the conversion in the eyes of the Jewish community.
The tendency to make vows to God was strong in ancient Israel; the Torah found it necessary to caution against the promiscuous making of vows (). As one commentary puts it, &quot;it is considered a fearsome sin for one to violate his vows and oaths and the Sages regard it as an extremely serious matter for one to approach the Days of Judgment [meaning the High Holy Days] with such violation in hand.&quot; Rash vows to God that for whatever reason were not fulfilled created painful religious and ethical difficulties for those who had made them; this led to an earnest desire for dispensation from them. Therefore, halakha allowed for the absolution from a vow (&#x27;hattarat nedarim&#x27;), which might be performed only by a scholar, or an expert on the one hand, or by a board of three Jewish laymen on the other.

This rite declared that the petitioners, who were seeking reconciliation with God, solemnly retracted their vows and oaths they had made to God during the period intervening between the previous Yom Kippur and the present one; this rite made them null and void from the beginning, entreating in their stead pardon and forgiveness from God. This is in accordance with the older text of the formula as it is preserved in the Siddur of Amram Gaon.

===Adoption into the prayer services===
The readiness with which vows were made and the facility with which they were annulled by the scribes gave the Karaites an opportunity to attack rabbinic Jews. This may have encouraged the &quot;geonim&quot; (leaders of early medieval Babylonian Jewry) to minimize the power of dispensation. Yehudai Gaon of Sura (760 CE), author of the &quot;Halakot Pesukot,&quot; forbade the study of the &quot;Nedarim&quot;, the Talmudic treatise on oaths. Thus the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; was discredited in both of the Babylonian academies and was not accepted by them.

Amram Gaon in his edition of the Siddur calls the custom of reciting the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; a foolish one (&quot;minhag shetut&quot;). According to others however, it was customary to recite the formula in various lands of the Jewish dispersion, and it is clear likewise from Amram&#x27;s Siddur that the usage was widespread as early as his time (9th century) in Spain. But the geonic practice of not reciting the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; was long prevalent; it has never been adopted in the Catalan or in the Algerian ritual, nor in the French regions of Carpentras or Avignon.

At one time it was widely believed that the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; was composed by Spanish &quot;Marranos&quot;, Jews who were forced to convert to Christianity, yet who secretly maintained their original faith. This idea has been shown to be incorrect, as the prayer pre-dates this era (circa 15th century) by many centuries. However, this prayer was indeed used by the Marranos and it is possible that its great significance and wide usage derives from this persecution. As Kol Nidre clearly predated the Spanish Inquisition, it was supposed that it may have commenced during the Visigothic period in Spain (7th century), but this theory has serious weaknesses, such as its adoption by Jewish communities around the world, even in liturgical communities that did not experience such persecution. It may be that it was simply inspired by the Talmudic instructions about avoiding oaths.

A very different reason for Kol Nidre was suggested by the &quot;Zohar&quot;; God has already threatened and vowed terrible punishments upon the Jewish people for their sins, but by our own demonstration that we can unbind ourselves from vows using Kol Nidre we hope to persuade God to similarly annul His own vows of calamity. As stated in the Orot Sephardic mahzor:

===Adoption into Yom Kippur services===

Originally, the annulment of vows was performed on Rosh Hashana, the New Year, ten days before Yom Kippur. The Talmud says, &quot;Who wished to cancel his vows of a whole year should arise on Rosh Hashanah and announce, &#x27;All vows that I will pledge in the coming year shall be annulled. There is, in fact, a ritual that is supposed to take place the day before Rosh Hashana (because one does not do such chores &quot;on&quot; a holy day), known as hatarat nedarim (annulment of vows), where the individual presents himself before a tribunal of three and recites a Hebrew formula, very different from that of Kol Nidrei, asking for annulment of all vows.

So, from a time before the composition of Kol Nidrei there was a corresponding ritual intended for Rosh Hashana. It is believed that Kol Nidrei was added to the liturgy of Yom Kippur, ten days after Rosh Hashana, because that service is much more solemn, because Yom Kippur is entirely attuned to the theme of repentance and remorse, because (despite the great importance of Rosh Hashana) Yom Kippur services are better attended, and perhaps because Yom Kippur itself is once referred to as Rosh Hashana in Scripture (Ezekiel 40:1). Such reasons were enumerated by, among others, Asher ben Jehiel (early 14th century). There may be an additional reason—perhaps the annulment of vows was moved to, or repeated at, the beginning of Yom Kippur in order to minimize the risk that new vows would be made in the ten-day interval between the repudiation of vows on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, and, more than the rather dry legalistic Rosh Hashana declaration, Kol Nidre includes an emotional expression of penitence that sets the theme for Yom Kippur.

===Permission for sinners===

Together with the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; another custom developed: the recital before the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; of the formula mentioned beginning &quot;Bi-yeshivah shel ma&#x27;alah&quot; (&quot;By authority of the Heavenly Court...&quot;), which has been translated above, and which gives permission to transgressors of the Law or to those under a ban &quot;to pray with the congregation&quot;, or, according to another version, to the congregation &quot;to pray with the transgressors of the Law.&quot; This addition is traced to Meir of Rothenburg (d. 1293), and was subsequently endorsed by the Rabbi of Mainz, Jacob ben Moses Moelin, &quot;the Maharil&quot; (died 1427), and substantiated by the Talmudic teaching that &quot;Any community fast in which sinners do not participate, is not considered a [valid] fast.&quot; From Germany this custom spread to southern France, Spain, Greece, and probably to northern France, and was in time generally adopted.

It has been suggested that Kol Nidre originated with this invitation to &quot;avaryanim&quot; (sinners) to join the congregation&#x27;s prayers, as an effort to inspire their return or at least prevent losing them completely, rather than as a mechanism for coping with Christian or Muslim persecution. The last word (העבריינים), usually translated as &quot;sinners&quot; or &quot;transgressors&quot;, is used in the Talmud for &quot;apostates&quot; or &quot;renegades&quot;, and in the Talmud Yerushalmi as a repetitious transgressor, indicating something worse that the usual reprobates, namely someone whose offenses are of such magnitude that he is no longer recognized by the Jewish community. Their inclusion in the Yom Kippur service is a temporary expedient, and does not operate as a remission of their sins or rejoin them to the congregation.

=== As it says ===
The original text of Kol Nidrei concluded, &quot;as it says (): &#x27;May all the people of Israel be forgiven, including all the strangers who live in their midst, for all the people are in fault, but Meir of Rothenburg ruled that the words &#x27;as it says&#x27; should be removed, so the verse became an independent recitation. These words are still recited in the Italian rite.

===Change of the Kol Nidre&#x27;s tense from past to future===
An important alteration of the wording of the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; was made by Rashi&#x27;s son-in-law, Rabbi Meir ben Samuel (early 12th century), who changed the original phrase &quot;from the last Day of Atonement until this one&quot; to &quot;from this Day of Atonement until the next&quot;. Thus, the dispensation was not a posteriori and concerning the unfulfilled obligations of the past year, but it was &quot;a priori&quot;, making reference to vows which one might not be able to fulfill or vows which one might forget to observe during the ensuing year. Meir ben Samuel likewise added the words &quot;we do repent of them all&quot;, since real repentance is a condition of dispensation. The reasons for this change were that an &quot;ex post facto&quot; annulment of a vow was meaningless and, furthermore, that no one might grant to himself a dispensation, which might only be given by a board of three laymen or a competent judge. Additionally, the Talmudic discussion of the annulment of vows speaks of the negation of vows which will be made in the future. Finally, there was the distinct probability that a person would die with unfulfilled vows having been made since the previous Day of Atonement, so annulling these vows in advance might diminish the weight such unkept vows imposed on him at his death.

It was Rabbeinu Tam, however, who accounted for the alteration which was made by his father, as already stated, and he also tried to change the perfect tense of the verbs (&quot;which we have vowed&quot;, &quot;have sworn&quot;, etc.) to the imperfect. Whether the old text was already too deeply rooted, or whether Rabbeinu Tam did not correct these verbal forms consistently and grammatically, the old perfect forms are still retained at the beginning of the formula, but a future meaning is given to them.

The alteration which was made by Meïr ben Samuel, who concurred with Isaac ibn Ghayyat&#x27;s view, was accepted in the German, northern French, and Polish rituals as well as in those rituals which were dependent on them, but it was not accepted in the Spanish, Roman, and Provençal rituals. The old version is, therefore, usually called the &quot;Sephardic&quot;. The old and new versions are sometimes found side by side. Because it is traditional to recite the Kol Nidrei three times, some Sephardic communities and even some Ashkenazic communities (especially in Israel) make a point of reciting both versions (usually referring to the previous Yom Kippur in the first two iterations and usually referring to the next Yom Kippur in the third), with some reciting both versions one after the other each of the three times.

===Language===
In the &quot;Siddur&quot; of Amram Gaon (9th century; printed 1865, Warsaw, p. 47) and in the Roman Mahzor (ca. 1486; printed 1541 folio 232b, p. 63) and the Romaniote Machzor (Venice 1523) the Kol Nidrei is written in Hebrew, and therefore begins &quot;Kol Nedarim&quot;. Both Hebrew versions refer to vows of the year just concluded, rather than vows made in the coming year. The two Hebrew versions are slightly different from each other. Amram&#x27;s version was apparently written unpointed, but a pointed version of Amram&#x27;s Hebrew version is given in Birnbaum. Amram&#x27;s Hebrew version is the one used in Balkan (Romaniote) and Italian liturgy. Otherwise, Ashkenaz and Sefardic liturgy has adopted Rabbeinu Tam&#x27;s Aramaic text. The words &quot;as it is written in the teachings of Moses, thy servant&quot;, which were said in the old form before the quotation of Numbers 15:26, were canceled by Meir of Rothenburg.

There has been some criticism from scholars fluent in Aramaic that the text of Kol Nidre has grammatical errors; however, any efforts to introduce corrections have been frustrated because the changes would not comport with the traditional, and much-beloved, melody.

===Method of recitation===
As to the manner in which the hazzan (cantor) is to recite the &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot;, the Mahzor Vitry (early 12th century) gives the following directions: &quot;The first time he must utter it very softly like one who hesitates to enter the palace of the king to ask a gift of him whom he fears to approach; the second time he may speak somewhat louder; and the third time more loudly still, as one who is accustomed to dwell at court and to approach his sovereign as a friend.&quot; However, Rabbi Meier ben Yitzchak of Worms (11th century), author of Akdamut, would sing it only twice, the Aleppo community would sing it seven times, and Maharil (died 1427) would sing it repeatedly in various tunes to ensure that latecomers would hear it.

The number of Torah-scrolls taken out for the &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; varied according to different customs. According to the custom of Frankfurt, no Torah Scrolls are removed; in other places one, two, three, seven, or even all that the synagogue possesses. The first Torah-scroll taken out is called the &quot;Sefer Kol Nidrei&quot;.

Although &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; is printed in every prayerbook for Yom Kippur, and it is commonly thought of as being the beginning of Yom Kippur, according to the opinion that it is annulling oaths from the previous year, it must be performed the commencement of Yom Kippur, since such juridical business cannot take place on a holy day. &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; should be recited before sunset, since dispensation from a vow may not be granted on the Sabbath or on a feast-day, unless the vow refers to one of these days. However, some communities (apparently Sephardic and in the minority) consider it proper to wait until nightfall, when Yom Kippur officially begins, before reciting Kol Nidre. The men of the congregation wear their prayer shawls, one of the few times in the year that these are worn in the evening. It would appear, in most congregations, that a sort of compromise has been adopted; Kol Nidre begins just before sundown, so by the time its last repetition is finished nightfall has commenced or is on the very cusp of commencing.

==Analysis==
The vows and pledges being annulled by this ceremony are of a limited category. &#x27;Kol Nidrei’ is a nullification of vows—whether past or future, gives people the right to break their word or to make insincere promises that will have no legal force. The &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; declaration can invalidate only vows that one undertakes on his own volition. It has &quot;no&quot; effect on vows or oath imposed by someone else, or a court. Also, the invalidation of future vows takes effect only if someone makes the vow without having in mind his previous &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; declaration. But if he makes the vow with &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; in mind—thus being openly insincere in his vow—the vow is in full force.&quot; Moreover, as Rabbi Yechiel of Paris explained in a Disputation that took place before the King and Queen of France in 1240, &quot;Only the erroneously broken vows are annulled, that nobody might commit the sin of intentionally breaking vows.&quot;

Philip Birnbaum, in his edition of the Mahzor, comments on this passage: &quot;It refers to vows assumed by an individual for himself alone, where no other persons or interests are involved. Though the context makes it perfectly obvious that no vows or obligations towards others are implied, there have been many who were misled into believing that by means of this formula all their vows and oaths are annulled. In the eleventh century Rabbi Meir ben Samuel (Rashi&#x27;s son-in-law) changed the original wording of &quot;Kol Nidré&quot; so as to make it apply to the future instead of the past, that is, to vows that one might not be able to fulfill during the next year.&quot; This is the Nusach Ashkenaz version, the Nusach Sefard version still refers to the past year. However The Complete ArtScroll Machzor, Yom Kippur, Nusach Sefard has the future with the past included in brackets.

Kol Nidrei is not a prayer, it makes no requests and is not addressed to God, rather, it is a juristic declaration before the Yom Kippur prayers begin. It follows the juridical practice of requiring three men as a tribunal, the procedure beginning before sundown, and of the proclamation being announced three times.

===Explanation of terms and variants===
The many different terms for vows and pledges used in Kol Nidrei can be confusing, especially because the English language is poor in short equivalent terms that express the same nuances. These terms are almost exclusively religious pledges of various kinds: That something will be done (or not done) or given in exchange for a prayer being answered, that something will be done (or not done) for religious purposes or to show religious devotion, that a thing will be used only for religious purposes (e.g., as a tool used only for building or repairing the Temple) and never for mundane purposes, that a thing will be given to the Temple or treated as if it were already given to the Temple, and so forth. To make this declaration clearer, every possible synonym for such pledging and for nullification or cancellation of such pledges is used.

Such vows, it is obvious, are sometimes made impulsively or in moments of panic, desperation or some other strong emotion, and would be impossible, impractical, or ruinous to fulfill. This is shown by the following Biblical usage of the terms in Kol Nidrei:

* A vow (&quot;neder&quot;, נדר) was made by Jephthah (), resulting in sacrificing his daughter in return for victory in battle; a &quot;self-imposed obligation&quot; (in the KJV &quot;binding oneself&quot;)
* &quot;Osar&quot; (אסר) is used repeatedly in to describe commitments a wife might make that the husband could nullify. The same word is used elsewhere in Scripture for a restraint or tying up (as in Judges chap. 15). In Talmudic usage it can also mean to interdict or to declare a thing to be forbidden.
* The regretted &quot;oath&quot; (&quot;shava&quot;, שׁבע) was made at Mizpah to cause the tribe of Benjamin to dwindle nearly to extinction (). A similar &quot;shava &quot; made by Saul, which would have resulted in his son&#x27;s execution but for the acclamation of the entire army ().
* Consecration (&quot;haromay&quot;, חרמי) is used for things whose use is &quot;dedicated&quot; (usually to the Temple) as in .
After this point Amram&#x27;s Hebrew version ceases to list forms of vows and shifts to synonyms for the making of vows, the list in the present day Kol Nidre uses Aramaic non-Biblical synonyms for pledges, which do not have equivalents in Biblical Hebrew:
* &quot;Konamay&quot; (קונמי) is used in the Talmud for a vow by which a tool or furnishing is forbidden for mundane use because pledged to Temple usage,
* &quot;kinusay&quot; (קנוסי) is used in the Talmud as a synonym for &quot;konamay&quot;.

Though these promises to God may have been ill-considered, the failure to keep them is a recurring offense – and acting as if promises made to God were so trifling that they could be thoughtlessly forgotten is a further offense; the only remedy is, first, to admit that these promises will never be fulfilled, by formally cancelling them – which is one of the purposes of the Kol Nidrei, and then to repent for them – which is the purpose of the Day of Atonement.

It has even been suggested that Kol Nidrei includes vows that had been fulfilled, because the Torah forbids the making of vows, so that even those which were kept required atonement. There is also a kabbalistic or spiritual purpose to Kol Nidrei: God has vowed, in Scripture, to punish Jewry for its sins; therefore by demonstrating that we can and do cancel our own vows, we hope to induce God to cancel His own dire decrees.

Kol Nidrei also admits our moral inconstancy. We made promises and pledges to God, often at a peak feeling of devotion or gratitude—or of desperation, but our good intentions are short-lived, and we allowed the promises to slip from our attention.

The text presented here is taken from the ArtScroll Mahzor for Yom Kippur (Ashkenaz ed.), which uses the formula &quot;from this Day of Atonement to the next&quot; in its main text but allows the alternative (&quot;from the last Day of Atonement to this Day&quot;) as a parenthetical option. The Hebrew version of Kol Nidrei set out in the Siddur of Rav Amram Gaon (ca. 870) uses the formula &quot;from the last ... to this ...&quot;, and similarly De Sola Pool. Wolf von Heidenheim&#x27;s mahzor uses &quot;from this Day ... to the next ...&quot;, and similarly Adler, and Birnbaum. The Rinat Yisroel combines both, &quot;from the last ... to this..., and from this...&quot;, and similarly the Syrian and other Sefardic or Mizrahi traditions set forth in the Orot mahzor and the Bagdadi version.

The Sefardic and Mizrahi traditions add one or two more synonyms for pledges (such as &quot;harem&quot;). Some Ashkenaz and Sefardic editions omit &quot;and any synonymous terms&quot;—וכנויי—that appears here in the first sentence.

== Historical controversies ==
===Use by anti-semites===
The &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; prayer has been used by non-Jews as a basis for asserting that an oath taken by a Jew may not be trusted.
Historically, this accusation was leveled so often and so persistently that many non-Jewish legislators considered it necessary to have a special form of oath administered to Jews (&quot;Oath More Judaico&quot;), and many judges refused to allow them to take a supplementary oath, basing their objections chiefly on this prayer. As early as 1240 in the Disputation of Paris, Yechiel of Paris was obliged to defend &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; against these charges. The Russian government, in 1857, decreed that the prayerbooks must include, as an introduction to Kol Nidrei, a Hebrew explanation to the readers of the limited nature of the vows that could be released by this ceremony.

As Prof. Ismar Elbogen said in his monumental study of Jewish Liturgy:It is well known how many baseless accusations the text of [&quot;Kol Nidre&quot;] has aroused against Jews in the course of centuries. But nowhere in the sources can any interpretation of a morally offensive nature be found, for the [rabbinic] authorities agree unanimously that the text has in view only obligations undertaken by an individual toward himself or &quot;obligations respecting cultic regulations of the community&quot;.

===Jewish rebuttals===
Rabbis have always pointed out that the dispensation from vows in &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; refers only to those an individual voluntarily assumes for himself alone and in which no other persons or their interests are involved. The first verse ends with a qualifier for all the forms of pledges and vows being annulled—עַל נַפְשָׁתָֽנָא—&quot;regarding ourselves&quot;—by which this formula is limited to annulling only those vows that would affect only ourselves but not vows that would affect any other person. The formula is restricted to those vows between man and God alone; they have no effect on vows made between one man and another. No vow, promise, or oath that concerns another person, a court of justice, or a community is implied in &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot;. It does not matter if a vow was made to one or more non-Jews, such a vow cannot be annulled. According to Jewish doctrine, the sole purpose of this prayer is to give protection from divine punishment in case of violation of the vow.

With reference to the annulment of vows described in , as well as to Kol Nidre, the then Chief Rabbi of the British Empire, Joseph Hertz wrote:

... Not all vows or oaths could be absolved. A vow or oath that was made to another person, even be that person a child or a heathen, could not be annulled except in the presence of that person and with his consent; while &quot;an oath which a man had taken in a court of justice could not be absolved by any other authority in the world&quot;. 

As pointed out above, many rabbis state that the vows referred to are applicable only to the individual, and not interpersonally. Moreover, the Biblical verse quoted at the end clearly refers to vows that were unintentionally unkept, not premeditatedly broken. It refers only to vows between the person making them and God, such as &quot;I swear that if I pass this test, I&#x27;ll pray every day for the next 6 months!&quot; or simply &quot;I swear that I will stop smoking this year!&quot;

Because this declaration has often been held up by anti-Semites as proof that Jews are untrustworthy, the Reform movement removed it from the liturgy - temporarily, but there was enough popular demand for its restoration. In fact, the reverse is true: Jews cherish this ritual because they take vows so seriously that they consider themselves bound even if they make the vows under duress or in times of stress when not thinking straight. This ritual gave comfort to those who were forcibly converted to Christianity, yet felt unable to break their vow to follow Christianity. In recognition of that history, the Reform movement restored this recitation to its liturgy.

===Jewish opposition===

Five geonim (rabbinic leaders of medieval Babylonian Jewry) were against, while only one was in favor of reciting the formula. Saadia Gaon (early 10th century) wished to restrict it to those vows extorted from the congregation in the synagogue in times of persecution, and he declared explicitly that the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; gave no absolution from oaths an individual took during the year.

Judah ben Barzillai (Spain, 12th century), in his work on Jewish law &quot;Sefer haIttim&quot;, declares that the custom of reciting the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; was unjustifiable and misleading, since many ignorant persons believe that all their vows and oaths are annulled through this formula, and consequently they take such obligations on themselves carelessly. For the same reason Rabbenu Yerucham (Provence, 14th century) criticized those who, relying on &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot;, made vows recklessly, and he declared them incapable of giving testimony. Other prominent opponents of it in the Middle Ages include Yom Tov Asevilli (&quot;Ritva&quot;, ca. 1330); Isaac ben Sheshet (&quot;Rivash&quot;, d. 1406); the author of the Kol Bo (15th century); and Leon of Modena (d. 1648). In addition, nearly all printed machzorim contain expositions and explanations of the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; in the restricted sense mentioned above.

==Reform in the 19th century==
Yielding to the numerous accusations and complaints brought against &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; in the course of centuries, the rabbinical conference held at Brunswick in 1844 decided unanimously that the formula was not essential, and that the members of the convention should exert their influence toward securing its speedy abolition.

The decision of the conference was accepted by many congregations of western Europe and in all the American Reform Judaism congregations, which while retaining the melody substituted for the formula a German hymn or a Hebrew psalm (particularly Psalm 130), or changed the old text to the words, &quot;May all the vows arise to thee which the sons of Israel vow unto thee, O Lord, ... that they will return to thee with all their heart, and from this Day of Atonement until the next,&quot; etc. Naturally there were many Orthodox opponents of this innovation, among whom M. Lehmann, editor of the &quot;Israelit&quot;, was especially prominent. In 1961, Kol Nidrei, in its full Aramaic text, was restored to the Reform liturgy, so strong was its sentimental appeal. Among Reconstructionist Jews, it was briefly omitted from the liturgy and then restored but with a slightly revised text that limited its application only to those vows that operated &quot;to estrange ourselves from those who have offended us or to give pain to those who have angered us&quot;.

At other times and places during the 19th century emphasis was frequently laid upon the fact that &quot;in the &#x27;Kol Nidrei&#x27; only those vows and obligations are implied that are voluntarily assumed, and that are, so to speak, taken before God, thus being exclusively religious in content; but that those obligations are in no wise included that refer to other persons or to non-religious relations.&quot;
Even before 1844, some rabbis and congregations (not all of them Liberal) had ceased reciting Kol Nidre: It is not found in the Berlin 1817 prayerbook, nor the Hamburg prayerbooks of 1819 and 1841, and the famous pioneer of Modern Orthodoxy, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, had omitted it during Yom Kippur services at least twice. In 1840, Rabbi Leopold Stein (who later became the Rabbi of Frankfurt on Main) published a volume of German language prayers and hymns offered as additions or alternatives to the traditional ones, and for a substitute for Kol Nidre he provided the hymn (apparently his own work), &quot;O Tag des Herrn!&quot; (&quot;O Day of the Lord&quot;); adding a lengthy footnote that said, &quot;That much though is certain and cannot be denied by anyone -- that the [Kol Nidre] formula is by no means suited to introduce the holiest of all days, and that it would have been more suitable for any occasion but that of the eve of the exalted Day of Atonement.&quot; An English translation - &quot;O come, day of God&quot; - of Stein&#x27;s hymn was used, in the place of &quot;Kol Nidre&quot;, in the American Reform &quot;Union Prayer Book&quot; (1945 &amp; 1963) - the 1894 edition of the Union Prayer Book had a slightly different English translation but it appears that some editions between then and 1945 were defective and erroneously omitted most of the pages (this page among them) for the eve of &#x27;Atonement Day&#x27;, but Kol Nidre was returned to the Reform liturgy in subsequent prayerbooks.

In the opinion of some Jewish writers, the principal factor that preserved the religious authority of the &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; is its plaintive melody.

==The Ashkenazi melody==
An ahistorical legend claims that the tune for Kol Nidre is &quot;missinai&quot; - unchanged since Moses climbed down from Mount Sinai. In the early 17th century, Rabbi Mordechai Jaffe of Prague, known as the Levush, mentioned that all cantors knew a set melody which was traditional for Kol Nidre. Jaffe was actually complaining that the widespread and solid adherence to this melody was hampering his efforts to introduce corrections into the words. And yet there are probably no two synagogues in which the melody is chanted note for note absolutely the same. Indeed, a critical examination of the variants shows near-agreement in the essentials of the first strain only, with transformations of great diversity in the remaining strains. However, these divergences are not radical, and are inevitable in a composition not due to a single originator, but built up and elaborated by many in turn, and handed on by them in distinct lines of tradition, along all of which the rhapsodical method of the hazzanut has been followed.

The musical structure of the Ashkenazi &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; is built upon a simple groundwork, the melody being an intermingling of simple cantillation with rich figuration. The opening of &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; is what the masters of the Catholic plainsong term a &quot;pneuma&quot;, or soul breath. Instead of announcing the opening words in a monotone or in any of the familiar declamatory phrases, a hazzan of South Germany prefixed a long, sighing tone, falling to a lower note and rising again, as if only sighs and sobs could find utterance before the officiant could bring himself to inaugurate the Day of Atonement.

===Similarities to Christian plainsong===

Pianist Emil Breslauer of the 19th century was the first to draw attention to the similarity of these strains with the first five bars of the sixth movement of Beethoven&#x27;s C sharp minor quartet, op. 131, &quot;adagio quasi un poco andante&quot;.

An older coincidence shows the original element around which the whole of &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; has been built up. The &quot;pneuma&quot; given in the Sarum and Ratisbon antiphonaries (or Roman Catholic ritual music-books) as a typical passage in the Gregorian mode (or the notes in the natural scale running from &quot;d&quot; to &quot;d&quot; [&quot;re&quot; to &quot;re&quot;]), almost exactly outlines the figure that prevails throughout the Hebrew air, in all its variants, and reproduces one favorite strain with still closer agreement.

The original pattern of these phrases seems to be the strain of melody so frequently repeated in the modern versions of &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; at the introduction of each clause. Such a pattern phrase, indeed, is, in the less elaborated Italian tradition, repeated in its simple form five times consecutively in the first sentence of the text, and a little more elaborately four times in succession from the words &quot;nidrana lo nidre&quot;.

The northern traditions prefer at such points first to utilize its complement in the second ecclesiastical mode of the Church, which extends below as well as above the fundamental &quot;re&quot;. The strain, in either form, must obviously date from the early medieval period, anterior to the 11th century, when the practice and theory of the singing-school at St. Gall, by which such typical passages were evolved, influenced all music in those French and German lands where the melody of &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; took shape.

Thus, then, a typical phrase in the most familiar Gregorian mode, such as was daily in the ears of the Rhineland Jews, in secular as well as in ecclesiastical music, was centuries ago deemed suitable for the recitation of &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot;, and to it was afterward prefixed an introductory intonation dependent on the taste and capacity of the officiant. Many times repeated, the figure of this central phrase was sometimes sung on a higher degree of the scale, sometimes on a lower. Then these became associated; and so gradually the middle section of the melody developed into the modern forms.

===Inspiration for other musical pieces===
The prayer and its melody have been the basis of a number of pieces of classical music, including a setting of the prayer by Arnold Schoenberg, a piece for solo cello and orchestra by Max Bruch, symphonic variations for orchestra by Emil von Reznicek, a string quartet by John Zorn, and others.

The Electric Prunes album &quot;Release of An Oath&quot;, subtitled and commonly called &quot;The Kol Nidre&quot; after the title of its first and thematically most central track, is based on a combination of Christian and Jewish liturgy.

==Popular culture==

Composer and cellist Auguste van Biene recorded his own arrangement of Kol Nidre in around 1908, with an unidentified pianist.

Comedian Lewis Black frequently references the Kol Nidre in some of his shows and his first book, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Sacred&quot;, referring to it as the spookiest piece of music ever written, claiming that it may have been the piece to inspire all of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s musical scores.

Kol Nidre plays a climactic role in several film and television adaptations of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, originally a play by Samson Raphaelson. In the 1927 film version, Kol Nidre is sung by notable Jewish entertainer Al Jolson. In the 1952 film version, it is sung by Danny Thomas, who in real life was a devout Christian of Lebanese heritage. In the 1959 television version, it is sung by Jewish comedian Jerry Lewis. Jewish singer Neil Diamond performs the song in the 1980 film version.

<doc id="157954" wikidata="Q336295" url="?curid=157954" title="Frederick Temple">
<text>Frederick Temple (30 November 1821 – 23 December 1902) was an English academic, teacher and churchman, who served as Bishop of Exeter (1869–1885), Bishop of London (1885–1896) and Archbishop of Canterbury (1896–1902).

== Early life ==
Temple was born in Santa Maura, one of the Ionian Islands, the son of Major Octavius Temple, who was subsequently appointed lieutenant-governor of Sierra Leone. On his retirement, Major Temple settled in Devon and contemplated a farming life for his son Frederick, giving him a practical training to that end.

Temple&#x27;s grandfather was William Johnson Temple, Rector of Mamhead in Devon, who is mentioned several times in James Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Johnson&quot;.

Temple was sent to Blundell&#x27;s School, Tiverton, and soon showed signs of being suited to a different career. He retained a warm affection for the school, where he did well both academically and at physical activities, especially walking. The family was not wealthy, and Temple knew he would have to earn his own living. He took the first step by winning a Blundell scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, before he was seventeen.

The Tractarian Movement had begun five years earlier, but the memorable Tract 90 had not yet been written. In the intellectual and religious excitement, he drew closer to the camp of &quot;the Oxford Liberal Movement.&quot; In 1842 he took a double first and was elected fellow of Balliol, and lecturer in mathematics and logic. Four years later he was ordained, and, with the aim of improving the education of the very poor, he accepted the headship of Kneller Hall, a college founded by the government for the training of masters of workhouses and penal schools. The experiment was not successful, and Temple himself advised its abandonment in 1855. He then accepted a school-inspectorship, which he held until he went to teach at Rugby School in 1858. In the meantime he had attracted the admiration of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and in 1856 he was appointed Chaplain-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria. In 1857 he was select preacher at his university.

== Rugby ==
At Rugby School, Thomas Arnold had died in 1842 and had been succeeded by Archibald Campbell Tait, who again was followed by Edward Meyrick Goulburn. Upon the resignation of the latter the trustees appointed Temple, who in that year (1858) had taken the degrees of B.D. and D.D. His life at Rugby School was marked by great energy and bold initiative.

Temple strengthened the school&#x27;s academic reputation in the classics, but also instituted scholarships in natural science, built a laboratory, and recognised the importance of these subjects. He reformed the sporting activities, in spite of all the traditions of the playing fields. His own tremendous powers of work and rough manner intimidated the pupils, but he soon became popular, and raised the school&#x27;s reputation. His school sermons made a deep impression on the boys, teaching loyalty, faith and duty.

It was two years after he had taken up his work at Rugby that the volume entitled &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; caused a controversy. The first essay in the book, &quot;The Education of the World,&quot; was by Temple. The authors of the volume were responsible only for their respective articles, but some of these were deemed so destructive that many people banned the whole book, and a noisy demand, led by Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, called on the headmaster of Rugby to dissociate himself from his comrades. Temple&#x27;s essay had dealt with the intellectual and spiritual growth of the race, and had pointed out the contributions made respectively by the Hebrews, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans, and others. Though accepted as harmless, it was blamed for being in the book. Temple refused to repudiate his associates, and it was only at a much later date (1870) that he decided to withdraw his essay. In the meantime, he printed a volume of his Rugby sermons, to show definitely what his own religious position was.

In politics Temple was a follower of William Ewart Gladstone, and he approved of the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland. He also wrote and spoke in favour of the Elementary Education Act 1870 of William Edward Forster, and was an active member of the Endowed Schools Commission.

In 1869, Gladstone offered him the deanery of Durham, but he declined because he wanted to stay at Rugby School. When later in the same year, however, Henry Phillpotts, bishop of Exeter, died, the prime minister turned again to Temple, and he accepted the bishopric of the city he knew so well.
== Bishoprics ==

The appointment caused a fresh controversy; George Anthony Denison, Archdeacon of Taunton, Anthony Ashley Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, and others formed a strong committee of protest, while Edward Pusey declared that &quot;the choice was the most frightful enormity ever perpetrated by a prime minister&quot;. At the confirmation of his election, counsel was instructed by Bishop Walter Trower to object to it, and in the voting the chapter was divided. Gladstone stood firm, and Temple was consecrated on 21 December 1869, by John Jackson, Bishop of London. There were murmurings among his clergy against what they deemed his harsh control, but his real kindness soon made itself felt, and, during the sixteen years of his tenure, he overcame the prejudices against him, so that when, on the death of John Jackson in 1885, he was translated to London, the appointment gave general satisfaction. In 1884 he was Bampton Lecturer, taking for his subject &quot;The Relations between Religion and Science.&quot; In 1885 he was elected honorary fellow of Exeter College, Oxford.

Temple&#x27;s tenancy of the bishopric of London saw him working harder than ever. His normal working day at this time was one of fourteen or fifteen hours, though under the strain blindness was rapidly coming on. Many of his clergy and candidates for ordination thought him a rather terrifying person, enforcing almost impossible standards of diligence, accuracy and preaching efficiency, but his manifest devotion to his work and his zeal for the good of the people won him general confidence. In London he continued as a tireless temperance worker, and the working class instinctively recognised him as their friend. When, in view of his growing blindness, he offered to resign the bishopric, he was urged to reconsider his proposal, and on the sudden death of Edward White Benson in 1896, though now seventy-six years of age, he accepted the see of Canterbury. There is a memorial to him at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Between 1871 and 1902 Temple was a governor of Sherborne School.

== Archbishop of Canterbury ==

As archbishop he presided in 1897 over the decennial Lambeth Conference. In the same year Temple and Archbishop of York William Maclagan issued a joint response to &quot;Apostolicae curae&quot;, a bull of Pope Leo XIII which denied the validity of Anglican orders. In 1899 the archbishops again acted together, when an appeal was addressed to them by the united episcopate, to rule on the use of incense in divine service and on the carrying of lights in liturgical processions. After hearing the arguments the two archbishops decided against both practices. During his archiepiscopate Temple was deeply distressed by the divisions which were weakening the Church of England, and many of his most memorable sermons were calls for unity.

His first charge as primate on &quot;Disputes in the Church&quot; was felt to be a most powerful plea for a more catholic and a more charitable temper, and again and again during the closing years of his life he came back to this same theme. He was zealous also in the cause of foreign missions, and in a sermon preached at the opening of the new century he urged that a supreme obligation rested upon Britain at this epoch in the world&#x27;s history to seek to evangelise all nations. In 1900 he presided over the World Temperance Congress in London, and on one occasion preached in the interests of women&#x27;s education.

On 9 August 1902, he discharged the important duties of his office at the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, and two days later was received in private audience by the King and Queen to be presented with the Royal Victorian Chain, a new decoration founded by the King in honour of his mother. In early October that year he visited St. David&#x27;s Theological College in Lampeter, Wales, for its 75th anniversary. The strain at his advanced age told upon his health, however. During a speech which he delivered in the House of Lords on 4 December 1902 on the Education Bill of that year, he was taken ill, and, though he revived sufficiently to finish his speech, he never fully recovered, and died on 23 December 1902. He was interred in Canterbury Cathedral four days later, where his grave is located in the cloister garden. His second son, William Temple, became Archbishop of Canterbury thirty-nine years later and is buried close to him.

== Science and religion ==
Temple had a lifelong interest in the relationship between science and religion. In 1860 at the famous meeting of the British Association which saw the debate between Thomas Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce, Temple preached a sermon welcoming the insights of evolution. In his Eight Bampton Lectures on the Relations between Religion and Science (1884) Temple stated clearly that &quot;doctrine of Evolution is in no sense whatever antagonistic to the teachings of Religion&quot;. These lectures also addressed the origin and nature of scientific, and of religious belief and the apparent conflicts between science and religion on free will and supernatural power.

==Family==
Temple married in 1876 Beatrice Blanche Lascelles (1844–1915), youngest daughter of Right Hon. William Lascelles (1798–1851), a Whig politician and son of the 2nd Earl of Harewood. Her mother was Lady Caroline Georgiana Howard (1803–1881), daughter of another Whig politician George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle. Beatrice Lascelles had nine elder siblings, including Lady Chesham, Lady Edward Cavendish, and the diplomat Sir Frank Lascelles.

They had two sons:
*Frederick Charles Temple (b. 1879)
*William Temple (1881–1944)

== Memorials ==
The Temple Reading Room and Museum at Rugby School is named after him, and contains an 1869 bust of him by Thomas Woolner.
There is a fine memorial in Canterbury Cathedral at the east end in the Corona depicting Temple kneeling in prayer.
The West Window of Exeter Cathedral also depicts him amongst the great figures of the cathedral&#x27;s history shown there.

A bust of Frederick Temple designed by Sir George Frampton is located outside the Big School Room at Sherborne School, where he served as governor from 1871 to 1902. The bust is inside a marble niche designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield which displays his coat of arms impaled with those of Exeter and Canterbury on the left and right respectively.

F. D. How included Temple in the 1904 book &quot;Six Great Schoolmasters&quot;.

== Honours ==
* 1842: Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford.
* 1885: Honorary Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford.
* 1897: Elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.
* 1902: Awarded the Royal Victorian Chain by King Edward VII.

<doc id="157955" wikidata="Q1067977" url="?curid=157955" title="Hazzan">
<text>A hazzan (; , lit. Hazan) or chazzan (, plural ; ; ) is a Jewish musician or precentor trained in the vocal arts who leads the congregation in songful prayer. In English, this prayer leader is often referred to as a [[cantor]], a term also used in Christianity.

The person who leads the congregation in a public prayer is called the &quot;sh&#x27;liaḥ&quot; (Hebrew for &#x27; of the congregation&#x27;). Any person is called a &quot;sh&#x27;liach tzibbur&quot; while they are leading a prayer. However, the term &quot;hazzan&quot; more commonly refers to someone who has special training in leading prayers, or who is appointed to lead prayers on a regular basis in a particular synagogue.

==Qualifications==
Jewish law restricts the role of &quot;sh&#x27;liah tzibbur&quot; to adult Jews; in Orthodox Judaism, it is restricted to males. In theory, any layperson can be a ; many synagogue-attending Jews will serve in this role from time to time, especially on weekdays or during a Yahrzeit. Proficiency in Hebrew pronunciation is preferred. In practice, in synagogues without an official ḥazzan, or in the absence of one, those with the best voice and the greatest knowledge of the prayers typically assume the role.

Even in the earliest times the chief qualifications demanded of the &quot;hazzan&quot;, in addition to knowledge of Biblical and liturgical literature as well as the prayer motifs (), were a pleasant voice and an artistic delivery; for the sake of these, many faults were willingly overlooked. The &quot;hazzan&quot; was required to possess a pleasing appearance, to be married, and to have a flowing beard. Sometimes, according to Isaac ben Moses of Vienna (13th century), a young &quot;hazzan&quot; having only a slight growth of beard was tolerated. Maimonides ruled that the &quot;hazzan&quot; who recited the prayers on an ordinary Shabbat and on weekdays need not possess an appearance pleasing to everybody; he might even have a reputation not wholly spotless, provided he was living a life morally free from reproach at the time of his appointment.

But all these moderations of the rule disappeared on holidays; then an especially worthy &quot;hazzan&quot; was demanded, one whose life was absolutely irreproachable, who was generally popular, and who was endowed with an expressive delivery. Even a person who had ever litigated in a non-Jewish court, instead of a Jewish court, could not act as &quot;hazzan&quot; on those days, unless he had previously done penance. However many authorities were lenient in this regard, and as long as a cantor was , desired by the congregation, he was permitted to lead the prayers even on the holiest of days.

Today, a &quot;hazzan&quot;, particularly in more formal (usually not Orthodox) synagogues, is likely to have academic credentials—most often a degree in music or in sacred music, sometimes a degree in music education or in Jewish religious education or a related discipline. The doctor of music degree is sometimes awarded to honour a &quot;hazzan&quot;.

==History==
Early sources in the Mishnah refer to a position called &quot;chazzan hakenesset&quot;, which involved leadership roles in public prayer, although not necessarily involving music or singing. Later, as public worship was developed in the Geonic period and as the knowledge of the Hebrew language declined, singing gradually superseded the role of sermons in synagogue worship, and the role of &quot;chazzan&quot; began to focus on chanting or singing of the prayers. Thus, while the idea of a cantor as a paid professional does not exist in classical rabbinic sources, the office of the ḥazzan increased in importance with the centuries, evolving a specialized set of skills and becoming a career in itself.

==Professional status==

The role of the &quot;hazzan&quot; as a respected full-time profession has become a reality in recent centuries. In the last two centuries Jews in a number of European communities, notably Germany and Britain, came to view professionally trained &quot;hazzanim&quot; as clergy and the &quot;hazzan&quot; as the deputy rabbi. After the enlightenment, when European nations gave full citizenship and civil rights to Jews, professionally trained &quot;hazzanim&quot; were accepted by the secular governments as clergy just as rabbis were.

Paradoxically, the United States government recognized cantors as the first Jewish clergy, even before rabbis were recognized: as a congregation could be organized and led by a committee of Jewish laypersons, who would not have the expertise in liturgy a &quot;hazzan&quot; would have, newly forming congregations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries sometimes hired a &quot;hazzan&quot; for a synagogue (and made sure that a kosher butcher was established in the neighborhood) for some time before setting about hiring a rabbi, seeing the &quot;hazzan&quot; (and the shokhet, or kosher butcher) as a more immediate need. The &quot;hazzan&quot; therefore solemnized marriages and otherwise represented the congregation in the eyes of civil authorities.

In the United States, many &quot;hazzanim&quot; supplement their ministry by also earning certification as and working as mohels, for bris ceremonies.

In the United States there are three main organizations for professionally trained &quot;hazzanim&quot;, one from each of the major Jewish denominations:

*American Conference of Cantors—Reform Judaism
*Cantors Assembly—Conservative Judaism
*Cantorial Council of America—Orthodox Judaism

===Training===
Many members of the Cantors Assembly are trained at the H. L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Many members of the American Conference of Cantors are trained at the Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music at Hebrew Union College—Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. Both of these programs offer a five-year training program. Members of the Cantorial Council, the Orthodox cantorial association, can train at the Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music at Yeshiva University in New York.

ALEPH, the Alliance for Jewish Renewal, includes a cantorial training program as part of its ordination program.

Full cantorial training is also offered by the Cantorial School of the Academy for Jewish Religion (California) in Los Angeles, the Cantorial Program at the similarly named Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, and the School of Jewish Music at Hebrew College. These institutions are unaffiliated with any particular Jewish denomination.

The curricula for students in these programs generally include, but are not limited to:
* Hebrew: modern, Biblical (Torah), and liturgical (&quot;siddur&quot;)
* &quot;Nusach&quot; (liturgical tradition)
* Laws and traditions pertaining to Jewish prayer service
* History and content of the &quot;siddur&quot;
* Music theory, sight-reading
* Playing an instrument, usually a piano or guitar
* Singing technique
* Cantillation—tropes for the liturgical chanting of biblical books
* Choral conducting
* Jewish history
* Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)
* Jewish music history
* Pastoral care and counseling
* Theology
===Non-Orthodox titles===
Until 2012, neither the Reform nor Conservative streams used the term &quot;ordained&quot; for trained cantors; use of the term &quot;invested&quot; precluded confusion with those they titled rabbi. In 2021, Conservative Judaism&#x27;s flagship institution, the Jewish Theological Seminary, began using the term &quot;ordain&quot; with respect to cantors.

==Female cantors in non-Orthodox Judaism==

In the 21st century, most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism no longer maintain gender distinctions, and therefore women often serve as cantors in these communities.

The earliest known woman &quot;ḥazzan&quot;, Julie Rosewald, called &quot;Cantor Soprano&quot; by her congregation, is sometimes called the United States&#x27; first female cantor, serving San Francisco&#x27;s Temple Emanu-El from 1884 until 1893. However, she was not ordained.

Another early and un-ordained woman &quot;ḥazzan&quot; was Madame Goldye Steiner, who sang in cantorial concerts as well as in Broadway shows throughout the 1920s. She was one of the first African-American female cantors. 

In 1955, Betty Robbins (born Berta Abramson in 1924, in Greece) was appointed as cantor of Temple Avodah, a Reform congregation in Oceanside, New York. Like Rosewald, she was not formally ordained, but &quot;the spokesman for the School of Sacred Music, founded in 1947 as the first training school for cantors in [the United States], said today there was no religious law, merely a tradition, against women becoming cantors&quot;, indicating the school&#x27;s institutional approval.

In 1975 Barbara Ostfeld-Horowitz became the first ordained female cantor in Jewish history.

The Women Cantors&#x27; Network was founded in 1982 to support and advocate for women cantors by Deborah Katchko, the second woman ever to serve as a cantor in a Conservative synagogue. Initially a group of only twelve women, its membership grew to 90 by 1996. The organization holds an annual conference.

In 1987 Erica Lippitz and Marla Rosenfeld Barugel became the first two female cantors ordained in Conservative Judaism; they were ordained at the same time by the Cantors Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City.

The Cantors Assembly, a professional organization of cantors associated with Conservative Judaism, did not allow women to join until 1990.

Sharon Hordes became the first cantor (female or otherwise) in Reconstructionist Judaism in 2002.

Avitall Gerstetter, who lived in Germany, became the first female cantor in Jewish Renewal (and the first female cantor in Germany) in 2002.

Susan Wehle became the first American female cantor in Jewish Renewal in 2006, serving until her death in 2009. The first American women to be ordained as cantors in Jewish Renewal after Susan Wehle&#x27;s ordination were Michal Rubin and Abbe Lyons, both ordained on January 10, 2010.

In 2001 Deborah Davis became the first cantor (female or otherwise) in Humanistic Judaism; however, Humanistic Judaism has since stopped graduating cantors.

In 2009, Iran-born Tannoz Bahremand Foruzanfar was ordained as a cantor by the non-denominational Academy for Jewish Religion (California), becoming the first female Persian ordained cantor in the United States.
==Golden age==
The period between the two world wars is often referred to as the &quot;golden age&quot; of (cantorial performance). The great figures of this era include Zavel Kwartin (1874–1953), Moritz Henle (1850–1925), Joseph &quot;Yossele&quot; Rosenblatt (1882–1933), Gershon Sirota (1874–1943), and Leib Glantz.

In the post–World War II period, prominent cantors were Moshe Koussevitzky, David Werdyger, Frank Birnbaum, Richard Tucker and Abraham Lopes Cardozo (1914–2006). Operatic tenor Jan Peerce, whose cantorial recordings were highly regarded, was never a cantor by profession but often served as one during the high holidays.

Popular contemporary cantors include Shmuel Barzilai, Naftali Hershtik, Yitzchak Meir Helfgot, Chazzan Avraham Aharon Weingarten, Ari Klein, Yaakov Lemmer, Joseph Malovany, Benzion Miller, Jacob (Jack) Mendelson, Aaron Bensoussan, Aaron Aderet, Alberto Mizrahi, Yaakov Yoseph Stark, Jochen (Yaacov) Fahlenkamp, Meir Finkelstein, Alex Stein, Daniel Gross, Azi Schwartz, Netanel Hershtik and Eli Weinberg.

<text>The Battle of the Plains of Abraham, also known as the Battle of Quebec (), was a pivotal battle in the Seven Years&#x27; War (referred to as the French and Indian War to describe the North American theatre). The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought on a plateau by the British Army and Royal Navy against the French Army, just outside the walls of Quebec City on land that was originally owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops in total, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France, influencing the later creation of Canada.

The culmination of a three-month siege by the British, the battle lasted about an hour. British troops commanded by General James Wolfe successfully resisted the column advance of French troops and Canadian militia under General Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm, employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts. Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle; Wolfe died of gunshot wounds just as the French began to retreat and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a musket ball wound just below his ribs. In the wake of the battle, the French evacuated the city.

The French forces would attempt to recapture Quebec the following spring, and in the Battle of Sainte-Foy, they forced the British to retreat within the walls. However, the French failed to take the city and in 1763, following defeat in the Montreal campaign, France ceded most of its possessions in eastern North America to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris.

The decisive success of the British forces on the Plains of Abraham and the subsequent capture of Quebec became part of what was known in Great Britain as the &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; of 1759.

==Overview==
As the Seven Years&#x27; War entered its later stages through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attack from British armies. In 1758 after their defeat in July at the Battle of Carillon, the British took Louisbourg in August, causing Atlantic Canada to fall into their hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. The British also captured Fort Frontenac in the same month, costing the French supplies for the Ohio Valley campaign. When some of the Indian supporters of the French made peace with the British, France was forced to draw its troops back. The French leaders, specifically Governor de Vaudreuil and General Montcalm, were unsettled by the British successes. However, Quebec was still able to protect itself as the British prepared a three-pronged attack for 1759.

James Wolfe expected to lead 12,000 men, but was greeted by only approximately 7,000 regular troops, 400 officers, and 300 gunners. He was supported by a fleet of 49 ships and 140 smaller craft led by Admiral Charles Saunders.
In preparation for the fleet&#x27;s approach to Quebec, James Cook surveyed a large portion of the river, including a dangerous channel known as The Traverse. Cook&#x27;s ship was one of the first ships up the river, sounding the channel and guiding the fleet as it moved up; Wolfe and his men landed on the Île d&#x27;Orléans on 28 June. The French attempted to attack the fleet by sending seven fire ships downriver to disrupt the landing, but the ships were set afire too early and British sailors in longboats were able to pull the flaming craft clear of the fleet.
The following day, Wolfe&#x27;s troops landed on the south bank of the river at Point Levis, nearly directly across the river from Quebec; an artillery battery was established there in early July that nearly levelled the lower town by bombardment.

Despite an air of defeatism among the leadership, the French troops and New French militia defenders focused their preparations for British attacks on the Beauport Shore. Montcalm and his staff, Major-General François de Gaston, Chevalier de Lévis, Colonel Louis Antoine de Bougainville, and Lieutenant-Colonel de Sennezergue, distributed some 12,000 troops in a nine-kilometre-long collection of fortified redoubts and batteries from the Saint-Charles River to the Montmorency Falls, along the shallows of the river in areas that had previously been targeted by British attempts to land. Before the British, a small fleet of supply ships had arrived in Quebec with much-needed supplies. Those supplies, along with 500 reinforcements, likely aided French resistance during the lengthy siege.
Wolfe, on surveying the town of Beauport, found that the houses there had been barricaded and organized to allow for musket fire from within; they were built in an unbroken line along the road, providing a formidable barrier. In addition, a screen of trees along the Montmorency River made an approach on that route dangerous. On 31 July, the first serious attempt by Wolfe&#x27;s troops to land on the northern shore led to the Battle of Beauport, also known as the Battle of Montmorency. Approximately 3,500 troops, supported by a heavy bombardment, attempted to land but were fired upon in the river shallows. Members of the Louisbourg Grenadiers, who reached the beach, attempted a generally undisciplined charge on the French positions, but came under heavy fire; a thunderstorm ended the fight and allowed Wolfe to pull his troops back after taking some 450 casualties to Montcalm&#x27;s 60.

Some French officers felt the Montmorency defeat would be the last British attack; Vaudreuil wrote afterwards that &quot;I have no more anxiety about Quebec. Wolfe, I assure you, will make no progress... He contented himself with losing about five hundred of his best soldiers.&quot; He predicted another attack would come within days. Others in the French camp felt the campaign was over.

For the remainder of the summer, Wolfe&#x27;s focus changed, possibly due to frustration with Montcalm&#x27;s tactics. Wolfe&#x27;s troops, along with American Rangers, attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the St. Lawrence. An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm&#x27;s army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful. However, the attacks did reduce the number of suppliers available to the French, especially as the British navy, unable to control the St. Lawrence entirely, was successful in blockading the ports in France.

==Preparations==

Through the summer siege, illness spread through the British camps. In August, Wolfe himself was bedridden, causing already low morale to slump even further among the British troops. With many men in camp hospitals, British fighting numbers were thinned, and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed by the end of September, or Britain&#x27;s opportunity would be lost. In addition, his frustration with Montcalm&#x27;s defensive stance continued to grow. In a letter to his mother, Wolfe wrote, &quot;The Marquis of Montcalm is at the head of a great number of bad soldiers, and I am at the head of a small number of good ones that wish for nothing so much as to fight him; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behaviour of his army.&quot; Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege, relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted, and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack.

After considering and rejecting a number of plans for landings on the north shore, a decision was made in late August by Wolfe and his brigadiers to land upriver of the city. If successful, such a landing would force Montcalm to fight, as a British force on the north shore of the St. Lawrence would cut his supply lines to Montreal. Initial suggestions for landing sites ranged as far as up the St. Lawrence, which would have given the French troops one or two days to prepare for the attack. Following the failed British assault on Montmorency, Montcalm altered his deployment, sending Bougainville and a column of approximately 1,500 regular troops, 200 cavalry, and a group of New French militia—some 3,000 men in all—upriver to Cap-Rouge to monitor the British ships upstream. He further strengthened his defences of the Beauport shore following the abandonment of the British camp at Montmorency, which he regarded as preparations for a descent (amphibious attack) on Beauport. In spite of warnings from local commanders, he did not view an upstream landing as a serious possibility.
The British, meanwhile, prepared for their risky deployment upstream. Troops had already been aboard landing ships and drifting up and down the river for several days when Wolfe on 12 September, made a final decision on the British landing site, selecting L&#x27;Anse-au-Foulon. L&#x27;Anse-au-Foulon is a cove situated west of the city, three kilometres upstream from Cap Diamant. It lies at the bottom of a high cliff leading to the plateau above, and was protected by a battery of guns. It is not known why Wolfe selected Foulon, as the original landing site was to be further up the river, in a position where the British would be able to develop a foothold and strike at Bougainville&#x27;s force to draw Montcalm out of Quebec and onto the plains. Brigadier-General George Townshend wrote that &quot;by some intelligence the General had, he has changed his mind as to the place he intended to land&quot;. In his final letter, dated , 8:30 p.m. 12 September, Wolfe wrote:
Wolfe&#x27;s plan of attack depended on secrecy and surprise. His plan required that a small party of men should land by night on the north shore, climb the Promontory of Quebec, seize a small road, and overpower the garrison that protected it, allowing the bulk of his army (5,000 men) to ascend the cliff by the small road and then deploy for battle on the plateau. Even if the first landing party succeeded in their mission and the army was able to follow, such a deployment would still leave his forces inside the French line of defence with no immediate retreat but the river. It is possible that Wolfe&#x27;s decision to change the landing site was owing less to a desire for secrecy and more to his general disdain for his brigadiers (a feeling that was reciprocated); it is also possible that he was still suffering the effects of his illness and the opiates he used as painkillers. Some revisionist historians believe Wolfe ordered the attack believing the advanced guard would be repulsed, and anticipated dying gallantly with his men rather than returning home in disgrace.

==Order of battle==

=== British forces ===
British forces engaged in the battle were commanded by Major General James Wolfe. There is disagreement on the total number of men and equipment that Wolfe took into combat, with numbers varying across sources. According to the Government of Canada website, which uses numbers from historian André Charbonneau, the British had 4,426 men, all British Army soldiers on the Plains of Abraham, along with two bronze cannon. Wolfe deployed his men as follows;

Main line (Centre) 
* Louisbourg Grenadiers
* 28th Regiment of Foot
* 43rd Regiment of Foot
* 47th Regiment of Foot
* 58th Regiment of Foot
* 78th (Fraser&#x27;s) Highlanders

Left
* 15th Regiment of Foot
* 2nd Battalion, 60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot
* 3rd Battalion, 60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot

Right
* &quot;En potence&quot; on the right flank – 35th Regiment of Foot

Reserve
* 48th Regiment of Foot

Rear
* The Light Infantry (80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot)

=== French forces ===
French forces engaged were composed of a mix of both regular force and militia units along with Indian allies, numbers varying between sources again. The militia were poorly armed with rifles and no bayonets and the Indian allies were unfamiliar with European-style battle tactics. According to the Government of Canada website, using numbers provided by historian André Charbonneau, the French had 2,000 men of the French Army, 600 Canadians drafted into the regular force units, and another 1,800 militiamen and Indian allies. The French had more cannon than their British counterparts, but their numbers are not known. In the battle, they were commanded by Major-General Louis Joseph de Saint Véran, Marquis de Montcalm who deployed his forces as follows;
Right
* Militia

Centre
* La Sarre Regiment
* Languedoc Regiment
* Béarn Regiment

Left
* Guyenne Regiment
* Royal Roussillon Regiment
* Montréal and Trois-Rivières militia

==Landing==

Bougainville, tasked with the defence of the large area between Cap Diamant and Cap Rouge, was upstream with his troops at Cap Rouge on the night of 12 September, and missed seeing numerous British ships moving downstream. A camp of approximately 100 militia led by Captain Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor, who had unsuccessfully faced the British four years previously at Fort Beauséjour, had been assigned to watch the narrow road at L&#x27;Anse-au-Foulon which followed a streambank, the Coulée Saint-Denis. On the night of 12 September and morning of 13 September, however, the camp may have contained as few as 40 men, as others were off harvesting. Vaudreuil and others had expressed their concern at the possibility of L&#x27;Anse-au-Foulon being vulnerable, but Montcalm dismissed them, saying 100 men would hold off the army until daylight, remarking, &quot;It is not to be supposed that the enemies have wings so that they can in the same night cross the river, disembark, climb the obstructed acclivity, and scale the walls, for which last operation they would have to carry ladders.&quot;

Sentries did detect boats moving along the river that morning, but they were expecting a French supply convoy to pass that night—a plan that had been changed without Vergor being notified. When the boats, loaded with the first wave of British troops, were challenged, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the 78th Fraser Highlanders, was able to answer the challenge in excellent French, allaying suspicion.

The boats, however, had drifted slightly off course: instead of landing at the base of the road, many soldiers found themselves at the base of a slope. A group of 24 volunteers led by Colonel William Howe with fixed bayonets were sent to clear the picket along the road, and climbed the slope, a manoeuvre that allowed them to come up behind Vergor&#x27;s camp and capture it quickly. Wolfe followed an hour later when he could use an easy access road to climb to the plain. Thus, by the time the sun rose over the Plains of Abraham, Wolfe&#x27;s army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs of the promontory of Quebec.

==Battle==

The plateau was undefended save for Vergor&#x27;s camp, as Vaudreuil had ordered one of the French regiments to relocate to the east of the city not long before the landing. Had the immediate defenders been more numerous, the British might have been unable to deploy or even been pushed back. An officer who would normally have patrolled the cliffs regularly through the night was unable to on the night of the 12th because one of his horses had been stolen and his two others were lame. The first notice of the landing came from a runner who had fled from Vergor&#x27;s camp, but one of Montcalm&#x27;s aides felt the man was mad and sent him away, then went back to bed. Admiral Saunders had staged a diversionary action off Montmorency, firing on the shore emplacements through the night and loading boats with troops, many of them taken from field hospitals; this preoccupied Montcalm.
Montcalm was taken aback to learn of the British deployment, and his response has been regarded as precipitate. Though he might have awaited reinforcement by Bougainville&#x27;s column (allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the British position) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces, or even yielded the city to Wolfe, he instead elected to confront Wolfe&#x27;s force directly. Had he waited, the British would have been entirely cut off—they had nowhere to go but back down the Foulon, and would have been under fire the entire way. To an artillery officer named Montbelliard, Montcalm explained his decision thus: &quot;We cannot avoid action; the enemy is entrenching, he already has two pieces of cannon. If we give him time to establish himself, we shall never be able to attack him with the troops we have.&quot;

===First engagements===

In total, Montcalm had 13,390 regular troops, Troupes de la Marine, and militia available in Quebec City and along the Beauport shore, as well as 200 cavalry, 200 artillery (including the guns of Quebec), 400 native warriors (including many Odawa under Charles de Langlade), and 140 Acadian volunteers, but most of these troops did not participate in the action. Many of the militia were inexperienced; the Acadian, Canadian, and indigenous irregulars were more used to guerrilla warfare. By contrast, the British 7,700 troops were almost all regulars.

On the morning of 13 September, Wolfe&#x27;s army formed a line first with their backs to the river, then spread out across the Plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.

Of the British troops, approximately 3,300 formed into a shallow horseshoe formation that stretched across the width of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire to keep them out of enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to the width of the lines. As Wolfe&#x27;s men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.
As French troops arrived from Beauport, Montcalm, one of few mounted men on the field, decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the British from their position. Accordingly, he deployed the forces immediately available in and near Quebec City and prepared an immediate attack, without waiting for further reinforcements from the Beauport shore. He arrayed his approximately 3,500 soldiers into place, his best regulars three deep, others six deep and his poorest regiment in column. At approximately 10 a.m., Montcalm, riding his dark horse and waving his sword to encourage his men, ordered a general advance on the British line.

As a European-trained military leader, Montcalm&#x27;s instinct was for large, set-piece battles in which regiments and soldiers moved in precise order. Such actions required a disciplined soldiery, painstakingly drilled for as long as 18 months on the parade ground, trained to march in time, change formation at a word, and retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys. Though his regular regiments (the &quot;troupes de terre&quot; or &quot;metropolitans&quot;) were adept at such formal warfare, in the course of the campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen, whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual: they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload, thus reducing the effect of concentrated fire at close range.

===Main engagement===

As the French approached, the British lines held their fire. Wolfe had devised a firing method for stopping French column advances in 1755 that called for the centre—in this case, the 43rd and 47th Foot regiments—to hold fire while waiting for the advancing force to approach within , then open fire at close range. The French held their fire and both armies waited for two or three minutes. The French finally fired two disorganized volleys.

Wolfe had ordered his soldiers to charge their muskets with two balls each in preparation for the engagement. Captain John Knox, serving with the 43rd Foot, wrote in his journal that as the French came within range, the regiments &quot;gave them, with great calmness, as remarkable a close and heavy discharge as I ever saw&quot;. After the first volley, the British lines marched forward a few paces towards the shocked French force and fired a second general volley that shattered the attackers and sent them into retreat.
Wolfe, positioned with the 28th Foot and the Louisbourg Grenadiers, had moved to a rise to observe the battle; he had been struck in the wrist early in the fight, but had wrapped the injury and continued on. Volunteer James Henderson, with the Louisbourg Grenadiers, had been tasked with holding the hill, and reported afterwards that within moments of the command to fire, Wolfe was struck with two shots, one low in the stomach and the second, a mortal wound in the chest. Knox wrote that one of the soldiers near Wolfe shouted &quot;They run, see how they run.&quot; Wolfe, on the ground, opened his eyes and asked who was running. Upon being told that the French had broken, he gave several orders, then turned on his side and said &quot;Now, God be praised, I will die in peace&quot;, and died.

With Wolfe dead and several other key officers injured, British troops fell into a disorganized pursuit of the retreating French troops. The 78th Fraser Highlanders were ordered by Brigadier-General James Murray to pursue the French with their swords, but were met near the city by a heavy fire from a floating battery covering the bridge over the St. Charles River as well as militia that remained in the trees. The 78th took the highest number of casualties of all British units in the battle. This was notably the last known successful Highland Charge in history.
An eyewitness with the 78th Highlanders (Dr Robert Macpherson) wrote three days after the battle:

The Highlanders pursued them to the very Sally Port of the town. The Highlanders returned towards the main body. When the highlanders were gathered together, they lay&#x27;d on a separate attack against a large body of Canadians on our flank that were posted in a small village and a Bush of woods. Here, after a wonderful escape all day, we suffered great loss both in Officers and men but at last drove them under the cover of their cannon which likeways did us considerable loss.

Townshend took charge of the British forces and realised that Bougainville&#x27;s column was approaching from the British rear, having taken some time to arrive from Cap Rouge. He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming French, a day-saving manoeuvre; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force, Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm&#x27;s army slipped back across the St. Charles.

During the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, was struck by either canister shot from the British artillery or repeated musket fire, suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh. He was able to make it back into the city, but his wounds were mortal and he died at the wee hours the next morning. A few moments before he drew his last breath, Montcalm asked his surgeon how much time he had to live. &quot;A few hours,&quot; he was answered. &quot;All the better,&quot; he said, &quot;I will not see the English in Quebec.&quot; He was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the Ursuline chapel by a British shell. In terms of casualties the British suffered 658 killed or wounded, of these, 61 were killed and 597 were wounded. The French casualties was between 644 to 716 killed or wounded, among those thirteen officers, and a further 350 men were taken prisoner.

==Aftermath==
In the wake of the battle, a state of confusion spread through the French troops. Governor de Vaudreuil, who later wrote to his government and put the full blame for the French rout on the deceased Montcalm, decided to abandon Quebec and the Beauport shore, ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with Bougainville, leaving the garrison in Quebec under the command of Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay.
Meanwhile, the British, first under the command of Townshend and later with Murray in charge, settled in to besiege the city in conjunction with Saunders&#x27; fleet. Within days, on 18 September, de Ramezay, Townshend and Saunders signed the Articles of Capitulation of Quebec and the city was turned over to British control. The remaining French forces positioned themselves on the Jacques-Cartier River west of the city. The British Navy was forced to leave the St. Lawrence shortly after the capture of Quebec, lest pack ice close the mouth of the river.

The next April, before the ice left the rivers, the Chevalier de Lévis, Montcalm&#x27;s successor as French commander, marched his 7,000 troops to Quebec. James Murray, the British commander, had experienced a terrible winter, in which scurvy had reduced his garrison to only 4,000. On 28 April, Lévis&#x27; forces met and defeated the British at the Battle of Sainte-Foy, immediately west of the city (near the site of Université Laval today). This battle proved bloodier than that of the Plains of Abraham, with about 850 casualties on the French side and 1,100 on the British side. The French had defeated the British, but the British were able to withdraw within the walls of Quebec, to which the French laid siege. A lack of artillery and ammunition, combined with British improvements to the fortifications, meant that the French were unable to take the city by storm. Both sides awaited reinforcements from Europe. The first ships to arrive, in mid-May, were part of a British fleet which had defeated Lévis&#x27; support ships. The success of the French army&#x27;s offensive against Quebec in the spring of 1760 had depended on the dispatch of a French armada, with fresh troops and supplies. A naval battle fought at Quiberon Bay, just off the coast of France, proved the decisive battle for this part of New France. The Royal Navy destroyed the French fleet, meaning France could not send a reserve force to save New France.

At Montréal that September, Lévis and 2,000 troops were confronted with 17,000 British and American troops. The French capitulated on 8 September, and the British took possession of Montreal. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763 to end the war and gave possession of parts of New France to Great Britain, including Canada and the eastern half of French Louisiana—lying between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains.

==Legacy==
In 2009, a number of activities were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a re-enactment of the battle itself (as well as a re-enactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as a slap in the face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.

Another commemorative event was proposed for the anniversary, the &quot;Moulin à paroles&quot;. Thousands gathered on the Plains of Abraham to listen to recitations of 140 significant texts from Quebec history, including the 1970 FLQ Manifesto. The inclusion of that document in the event led to condemnations and a boycott from federalist politicians and the withdrawal of some government funding for the event. The &quot;Moulin à paroles&quot; took place without incident.

In 2017, during construction within the Old City of Quebec, a cannonball was found which is believed to have been fired during the siege.

According to a myth, Wolfe sang the soldier song &quot;How Stands the Glass Around&quot; the night before the battle. Due to that myth, said song is also called &quot;General Wolfe&#x27;s Song&quot;.
In his work &quot;Montcalm and Wolfe&quot;, Francis Parkman states that the evening before the battle, Wolfe recited Thomas Gray&#x27;s &#x27;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&#x27;, which includes the line &quot;the paths of glory lead but to the grave.&quot;

<text>Henry Phillpotts (6 May 177818 September 1869), often called &quot;Henry of Exeter&quot;, was the Anglican Bishop of Exeter from 1830 to 1869. He was one of England&#x27;s longest serving bishops since the 14th century.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
Henry Phillpotts, D.D., Bishop of Exeter, was born on 6 May 1778 at Bridgwater, Somerset, England, the son of John Phillpotts, a factory owner, innkeeper, auctioneer and land agent to the Dean and Chapter of Gloucester Cathedral. He grew up in Gloucestershire, and was educated at Gloucester Cathedral school. John Phillpotts, Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester city between 1830 and 1847, was his elder brother. Two other brothers, Thomas and George, and two sisters, Isabella and Sibella, reached adulthood; a number of other siblings died in infancy or childhood.

Elected a scholar of Corpus Christi, Oxford, at the age of only thirteen, he took his BA at Corpus Christi, and his MA at Magdalen College in 1795, aged eighteen. He took holy orders in 1802, being ordained deacon by John Randolph, Bishop of London, and priest by Henry Majendie, Bishop of Chester, in 1804.

He was selected university preacher in 1804, in which year he published his &quot;Sermon on 5 November&quot;, delivered before the University of Oxford.

In September 1804 he was presented to the Crown living of Kilmersdon, near Bath, which he held until 1806. He does not appear ever to have resided there, duty being taken by a curate named Daniel Drape, according to the parish registers.

=== Diocese of Durham ===
Philpotts married in October 1804 and in 1805 became vicar. He was appointed chaplain to Bishop Middleham, County Durham, in the succeeding year. For twenty years he was chaplain to Bishop Shute Barrington, in the Diocese of Durham.

In 1808 he received his next preferment, being collated by the bishop to the large and important parish of Gateshead—within a year his rapid advancement continued with the collation to the ninth prebendal stall in Durham Cathedral.
&quot;That at the age of 31 he should already have held four livings and a prebendal stall testifies to the regard in which he was held by his diocesan, and the usefulness of his marriage connection.&quot;

He now resided for a considerable part of the year at Durham, and on the chapelry of St Margaret in the city becoming vacant, he was presented to it by the Dean and Chapter on 28 September 1810. On 30 December 1815 Philpotts received yet further preferment, being collated by the bishop to the second canonry in the Cathedral, the emoluments of which were considerably higher than those of the ninth. This he held for five years, at the end of which period his literary and controversial abilities brought him into advancing prominence.

After holding the rich living of Stanhope, Durham, from 1820, and the Deanery of Chester from 1828, he was consecrated Bishop of Exeter in 1831, holding with the see a residentiary canonry at Durham which he secured permission to hold along with his bishopric, one of the last cases of the benefice in commendam by which medieval and later bishops had often profited.

Philpotts recognised the need to look after his family, extensive as it was — he had 18 children. When he was offered the bishopric in Exeter he realised that the stipend (£3,000) was not enough to support his family, so he asked to retain his parish of Stanhope, in Durham (as a non-resident), which would be worth an additional £4,000 a year. As a compromise he was instead offered the canonry at Durham which was worth a similar amount, and was a post which he continued to hold until his death.

=== Diocese of Exeter ===
As bishop he was a strict disciplinarian, and did much to restore order in a diocese whose clergy had become extraordinarily demoralized and over which he wielded considerable power.

The diocese at that time extended from the Somerset and Dorset borders to the Isles of Scilly in Cornwall. His episcopate was characterized by the establishment of many new parishes in Cornwall and considerable evangelical efforts.

In 1841 he built for himself a palace at Torquay, Devon. Bishopstowe (now the Palace Hotel) served as the bishop&#x27;s residence, which he preferred as a home to the Bishop&#x27;s Residence attached to Exeter Cathedral. The gardens in the of private land stretching to the sea are still a major attraction today together with the Bishop&#x27;s Walk at the local beauty spot of Ansteys Cove.

Phillpotts was aware that his appointment to Exeter was not popular locally and knowing of his unpopularity he at times took measures to protect himself from it. He admits in a letter to Ralph Barnes, his secretary, on 14 December 1830 to being &quot;Cautious...in admitting adverse newspapers to my table, yet the caution has not prevented me from hearing of the extreme unpopularity of my appointment to Exeter.&quot;

The year 1831 saw Phillpotts as the victim of the Guy Fawkes Night custom of burning effigies of clergymen; knowing his reputation he took action by requesting protection, thus the 7th Yeomanry Cavalry filled the palace at Exeter, while the crowd in the cathedral yard burned Phillpotts in effigy; ... hollow turnip as head and candle as nose, clad in mitre and lawn sleeves... (Chadwick I, 1997, p 29)

In 1848 he placed an appeal in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of 5 January 1848, for help for the poor of Devonport; his request was answered by Lydia Sellon who was just about to travel to Italy for her health. Philpott&#x27;s inspiration of Sellon led to the formation of an Anglican order which Sellon led.

== Character ==

Phillpotts&#x27; character was of the type that determined never to give up on a fight and he persisted in applying his standards. There were many ways that unscrupulous clergy could abuse the Episcopal patronage system, but:
so long as Henry Phillpotts was Bishop of Exeter they avoided the Diocese of Exeter, for they knew that this doughty fighter would fight them to the end if he smelt something improper, whatever the cost to his pocket, however unfavourable the publicity and whatever the inadequacy of his own legal standing. (Chadwick II, 1997, p 212)

He was: ... a genuinely religious man with his religion concealed behind porcupine quills, he constantly quarrelled in the House of Lords, exposing opponents&#x27; follies with consummate ability, a tongue and eyes of flame, an ugly tough face and vehement speech.

The bishop&#x27;s strong views and lack of inhibitions in promoting them at times gained him many enemies in key places: That devil of a Bishop who inspired more terror than ever Satan did...of whom, however, it must be said that he is a gentleman.
(Lord Melbourne, as quoted in Newton, 1968, p173)

Phillpotts at times became unpopular with former friends; one such was Rev. Sydney Smith, a former Tory ally who went on to say: I must believe in the Apostolic Succession, there being no other way of accounting for the descent of the Bishop of Exeter from Judas Iscariot. (Lambert, 1939, 39)

The text concerning the woman who anointed the head of Jesus with a &#x27;very precious&#x27; ointment was chosen by the Bishop for his sermon at the consecration on 24 August 1837 of The New Cemetery in Exeter. The occasion was reported enthusiastically in the local newspaper &quot;The Flying Post&quot; (31 August 1837): In its language this sermon was most elegant‚ its delivery was a masterpiece of eloquence, and it was one of the most instructive and enlightened discourses that has been heard.

In the foreword to Davies&#x27; biography of Phillpotts, Prof. Norman Sykes summarises the character of the Bishop: Henry of Exeter, like Job’s war-horse, snuffed the battle from afar; and scented, moreover, a remarkable number and variety of contests in which to engage, without exhausting his capacity for polemic. Like William Warburton of an earlier age (though perhaps he would not have relished the comparison) he was a born fighter. It was his fortune furthermore to live in an age when occasions of dispute were legion; and he threw himself with avidity into their several aspects. Born into the era of the unreformed Parliament and Church, he opposed Catholic Emancipation and parliamentary reform; and was a pluralist who wished to retain in commendam the golden rectory of Stanhope with the See of Exeter, and only compromised by the exchange of living for a rich prebendal stall of Durham, Yet he lived to adjust himself to revolutionary changes in both Church and State. In ecclesiastical matters he was a champion of the principles of the Tractarian revival (a position not to his mind in the leastwise incompatible with mordant criticism of details and individuals); he encouraged the wearing of the surplice, and was a pioneer in the restoration of diocesan synods, and became involved in controversy concerning religious sisterhoods in the Church of England. He was the protagonist in the famous Gorham controversy, and held his ground in defeat when Manning seceded to Rome in protest against the verdict of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Gorham&#x27;s favour. As a diocesan bishop he was outstanding in administration and pastoral oversight; and his episcopate left its enduring mark on the Diocese of Exeter.

Davies himself explains: No biographer of Phillpotts could, I think, complete his task with a feeling of real affection for the subject of his study. His character and gifts must command respect, if not approval; but he exhibited a curious lack of balance, and a failure to appreciate and adapt himself to the mood of the times which must detract from a firm claim to greatness on behalf of one so impervious to the changes in contemporary thought and opinion. He deserves, however, to be commemorated as an outstanding figure in the Anglican Church of the nineteenth century, and in particular for his High Church sympathies before the days of the Oxford Movement, at the same time noting that he could never quite come to terms with the Tractarians; and also for his many innovations in diocesan administration, for example, his opposition to non-residence, his advocacy of theological colleges, and his courage in convening a diocesan synod – perhaps the most important event of his career. This study is therefore both an attempt to do justice to his virtues in fearlessly contending for his convictions, while at the same time not disguising those failings which were such a conspicuous feature of his character.

== Politics ==
Phillpotts was an energetic supporter of the Tory party, even when it acted contrary to his views in passing the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. In the House of Lords, Phillpotts opposed the 1832 Reform Bill and most other Whig reforms. He was a high-church reformer in his own diocese, aiming to increase the prestige, efficiency and orthodoxy of the church organisation. He was well known for using litigation to achieve his aims and was an earnest administrator, for example, fighting hard to raise the minimum salary for curates in his Diocese to £50, seeking to increase the rights of the poor under the Poor Laws and to ease the plight of children employed in coal-mines and as chimney-sweeps.

== Restoration of Convocation ==
One of Phillpotts&#x27; greatest political battles was over the restoration of Convocation, which has developed into the General Synod (as it is now called). He was convinced that the Church needed to establish its rulings in a legislative body, and in a communication in May 1843 to his friend, the Rt Hon J.W. Croker, he explained:
I wish it to sit again, only for the purpose of synodically devising a better synod than itself; one, more like the synods of the early church – in &quot;one&quot; house, with less of power to the Presbyters – but more means of counsel and aid from them to the Bishops than their separate house gives. I need not tell &quot;you&quot; that Convocation is not the ancient Synod of our own Church. We need, – &quot;and must have&quot; – a legislative body, sitting for real business from time to time. It ought to consist of bishops either solely (in the presence of Presbyters who should have a right, not to debate with them, but, hearing what they discuss, to represent by writing their opinions, when they think it necessary) or of bishops and such divines and representatives of the clergy, as shall be found necessary, securing a real preponderance to the bishops... I am confident that it is hardly possible for us to go on long without restoring to the Church a real Church legislation... There is not perhaps enough needing amendment in the Rubrics, of itself, to require a Synod. But of the Canons this cannot be said... They must be altered if the Church is to last in England, under the pressure of all that is opposed to it in privileges (supposed or real) of Dissenters – and with the little of real power of restraint over its own members, even its clergy, which it at present has.

== Publications ==
Phillpotts was renowned for his political pamphlets and the fact that he aired his opinions on every matter of current affairs, although he was not the greatest of diplomats:
The House of Lords expected a humane and courtly manner of bishops and was horrified at the fury of his tone, at the incongruity between his violence and his lawn sleeves. (Chadwick I, 1997, 217)
His published works include numerous speeches and pamphlets, including those connected with his well-known Roman Catholic controversy with Charles Butler (1750–1832) and with the Gorham case, in which he was a principal player. He was a prolific writer of articles on matters of politics, social order and religion, propounding conservative and often controversial views. He was regarded as an opponent of Catholic emancipation, and on this theme published &quot;Letters to Charles Butler&quot; (1825), &quot;Letters to Canning&quot; (1827) and &quot;A Letter to an English Layman on the Coronation Oath&quot; (1828). However, he eventually approved of Peel&#x27;s scheme for granting relief to Catholics in 1829.

== Legacy ==
Phillpotts&#x27; position was that of the traditional High Churchman, with little sympathy either with the evangelicals or with the Tractarians, although he was considered to represent the conservative high church wing of the Oxford Movement and emphasized liturgical forms of worship, episcopal government, monastic life, and early Christian doctrine as normative of orthodoxy.

On the one hand, the famous Gorham judgment was the outcome of his refusal to give the living of Brampford Speke to George Cornelius Gorham (1787–1857), who had expressed disbelief in baptismal regeneration; on the other hand, he denounced the equally famous &quot;Tract 90&quot; in his episcopal charge of 1843.

Phillpotts was generous in his gifts to the church, founding the theological college at Exeter and spending large sums on the restoration of the cathedral.
Exeter Cathedral states that Phillpotts was able to restore the Bishop&#x27;s palace in a &quot;most creditable manner&quot;.

An allegation, made at the General Synod in 2006 claimed that Phillpotts was paid almost £13,000 (£12,729.5s.2d) in 1833, under the terms of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, as compensation for the loss of slaves when they were emancipated. The same claim was repeated in the House of Commons by Chris Bryant, MP for Rhondda: However, it has been shown that the Compensation of £13089.4s.4d was paid to Phillpotts and three others acting as trustees and executors for John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley for 665 slaves on three plantations in Jamaica. It was considered unlikely that any share of such funds, equivalent to more than one million pounds sterling in present value, went to Phillpotts as he would not have been permitted to be paid for acting as Executor nor to benefit under the terms of the Will. Further investigation into the will of Lord Dudley has shown that Phillpotts was given and item of £2000 in a codicil letter attached to the will dated September 21, 1831. Given that the executors did benefit financially from the will it cannot be said with certainty that the executors did not benefit financially from the ‘slave compensation’ payment, especially because the will was contested in the courts and the slave compensation was under consideration in those proceedings. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eb9Ui6LGsHtwievPqHScJw95v71gQRfP/view

Other large amounts bequeathed to the executors in the codicil letter include:
“item, to John Benbow Esq. of Lincolns Inn, five thousand pounds. Item, to Francis Downing Esq, of Dudley four thousand pounds. (as well as) Item to Henry Lord Bishop of Exeter two thousand pounds”

Both the office of the then Bishop of Exeter, Michael Langrish, at the time of the allegation, and the Devon County Library (which holds Diocesan records), have stated that they hold no record of any further involvement in the slave trade by Phillpotts other than the recording as a Trustee/Executor of a joint holding of the 665 slaves that were the property of John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley. Although Bishop Phillpotts did not own slaves, the allegation remains, that he was party to the forgery of the will of Lord Dudley. The will of Lord Dudley is held in The National Archives, PROB 10/5417 this document includes the codicil letters and letters pertaining to the authenticity of the will written by Jon Benbow (Solicitor to Lord Dudley), and Henry Money Wainwright, Clerk to Jon Benbows solicitors and scribe of the will.

His biographer sums up his legacy thus:
The champion of lost causes, his attitude, his policy, and even his virtues became increasingly inappropriate. Loyal and even tender in family relationships; staunch in friendships; violent in controversy; brilliant in debate, he certainly deserves to be commemorated as one of the outstanding figures on the Bench during the nineteenth century.

The church tower at St. Marychurch was restored in 1873, at a cost of £3,500, in the bishop&#x27;s memory.

The Bishop Phillpotts Library in Truro, Cornwall, founded by the bishop in 1856 for the benefit of the clergy of Cornwall, holds more than 10,000 volumes, mainly theological, open to access by clergy and students of all denominations. It was opened in 1871 and almost doubled in size in 1872 by the bequest of the collection of Prebendary Ford.

==Marriage==
In October 1804, not long after his ordination as a priest, Henry Phillpotts married Deborah Maria Surtees (1782–1863). She was a niece of John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon: thus the marriage marked a rise in social status for the young clergyman whose own family background was undistinguished.

==Family==
Henry Phillpotts and his wife Deborah had a total of eighteen children. Of these the eldest son was William Phillpotts (1807–1888), Archdeacon of Cornwall and vicar of St Gluvias. William Phillpotts&#x27; sons included James Surtees Phillpotts, Headmaster of Bedford School, and his grandsons included Brigadier General Louis Murray Phillpotts and Lieutenant Colonel Brian Surtees Phillpotts, both of them heroes of the First World War.

Several of Henry Phillpotts&#x27; children married into the families of his diocesan clergy, examples being Maria Phillpotts who in 1833 married the Reverend Richard Stephens, rector of Dunsford, Sybella Phillpotts who in 1836 married the Reverend Francis Houssemayne du Boulay, rector of Lawhitton, and Charles Edward Phillpotts, an Army officer who in 1860 married Jane Hole, daughter of the rector of Chulmleigh.

The West Country writer Eden Phillpotts was a grandson of Henry Phillpotts&#x27; younger brother Thomas Phillpotts (1785–1862), a West Indies merchant and plantation owner and subsequently co-owner (with Samuel Baker) of Bakers Quay at Gloucester Quays.

== Death ==

On 9 September 1869 Phillpotts formally executed the resignation of his see, but before its completion he died on 18 September 1869. He was buried in the churchyard at St Marychurch, Torquay, near his wife Deborah, who had died six years before him. 
== Obituary ==
Extract from &quot;The Times&quot;, 20 September 1869:
Fierce, fiery, and intolerant of opposition to a fault, and sincere and earnest in an age which is not remarkable for earnestness in religion, he held to the last to the via media of the Anglican Church as the strongest safeguard against Romish and Calvinistic errors, and probably rejoiced to die like Ken and Laud and scores of High Church prelates of the Stuart times, expressing his firm faith in the Anglo-Catholic Church as essentially one and the same in doctrine and faith with the undivided Church of the first five centuries of the Christian era. Well, at length he rests from his labours side by side with Archbishop Sumner and Mr Gorham. Let us write on his tomb one simple word, Requiescat.

== In literature ==
In Anthony Trollope&#x27;s 1855 novel, &quot;The Warden&quot;, the fictional archdeacon of Barchester Cathedral, Dr. Grantly, keeps in his private study &quot;the busts of the greatest among the great: Chrysostom, St. Augustine, Thomas à Becket, Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop Laud, and Dr. Philpotts&quot; (chap. XII).

Bishop Phillpotts appears as a pompous bishop of Exeter, in Edward Marston&#x27;s historical novel set in 1857, &quot;The Stationmaster&#x27;s Farewell&quot;. This is no.9 of the Railway Detective series featuring Inspector Colbeck and Sergeant Leeming.

<text>Data General Corporation was an early minicomputer firm formed in the 1968. Three of the four founders were former employees of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).

Their first product, 1969&#x27;s Data General Nova, was a 16-bit minicomputer intended to both outperform and cost less than the equivalent from DEC, the 12-bit PDP-8. A basic Nova system cost two-thirds or less than a similar PDP-8 while running faster, offering easy expandability, being significantly smaller, and proving more reliable in the field. Combined with Data General RDOS (DG/RDOS) and programming languages like Data General Business Basic, Novas provided a multi-user platform far ahead of many contemporary systems. A series of updated Nova machines were released through the early 1970s that kept the Nova line at the front of the 16-bit mini world.

The Nova was followed by the Eclipse series which offered much larger memory capacity while still being able to run Nova code without modification. The Eclipse launch was marred by production problems and it was some time before it was a reliable replacement for the tens of thousands of Novas in the market. As the mini world moved from 16-bit to 32, DG introduced the Data General Eclipse MV/8000, whose development was extensively documented in the popular 1981 book, &quot;The Soul of a New Machine&quot;. Although DG&#x27;s computers were successful, the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981 marked the beginning of the end for minicomputers, and by the end of the decade, the entire market had largely disappeared. The introduction of the Data General/One in 1984 did nothing to stop the erosion.

In a major business pivot, in 1989 DG released the AViiON series of scalable Unix systems which spanned from desktop workstations to departmental servers. This scalability was managed through the use of NUMA, allowing a number of commodity processors to work together in a single system. Following AViiON was the CLARiiON series of network-attached storage systems which became a major product line in the later 1990s. This led to a purchase by EMC, the major vendor in the storage space at that time. EMC shut down all of DG&#x27;s lines except for CLARiiON, which continued sales until 2012.

==History==
===Origin, founding and early years: Nova and SuperNova===
Data General (DG) was founded by several engineers from Digital Equipment Corporation who were frustrated with DEC&#x27;s management and left to form their own company. The chief founders were Edson de Castro, Henry Burkhardt III, and Richard Sogge of Digital Equipment (DEC), and Herbert Richman of Fairchild Semiconductor. The company was founded in Hudson, Massachusetts, in 1968. Harvey Newquist was hired from Computer Control Corporation to oversee manufacturing.

Edson de Castro was the chief engineer in charge of the PDP-8, DEC&#x27;s line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market. It was designed specifically to be used in laboratory equipment settings; as the technology improved, it was reduced in size to fit into a 19-inch rack. Many PDP-8s still operated decades later in these roles. De Castro was watching developments in manufacturing, especially more complex printed circuit boards (PCBs) and wave soldering that suggested that the PDP-8 could be produced much more inexpensively. DEC was not interested, having turned its attention increasingly to the high-end market. Convinced he could improve the process, De Castro began work on his own low-cost 16-bit design.
The result was released in 1969 by Data General as the Nova. The Nova, like the PDP-8, used a simple accumulator-based architecture. It lacked general registers and the stack-pointer functionality of the more advanced PDP-11, as did competing products, such as the HP 1000; compilers used hardware-based memory locations in lieu of a stack pointer. Designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later PDP-8 machines, it was packaged on four PCB cards and was thus smaller in height, while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster. Announced as &quot;the best small computer in the world&quot;, the Nova quickly gained a following, especially in scientific and educational markets, and made the company flush with cash. DEC sued for misappropriation of its trade secrets, but this ultimately went nowhere. With the initial success of the Nova, Data General went public in the fall of 1969.
The original Nova was soon followed by the faster SuperNova, which replaced the Nova&#x27;s 4-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with a 16-bit version that made the machine roughly four times as fast. Several variations and upgrades to the SuperNova core followed. The last major version, the Nova 4, was released in 1978. During this period the Nova generated 20% annual growth rates for the company, becoming a star in the business community and generating US$ 100 million in sales in 1975. In 1977, DG launched a 16-bit microcomputer called the microNOVA to poor commercial success.
The Nova series played a very important role as instruction-set inspiration to Charles P. Thacker and others at Xerox PARC during their construction of the Xerox Alto.

===Late 1970s to late 1980s: crisis and a short term solution===

In 1974, the Nova was supplanted by their upscale 16-bit machine, the Eclipse. Based on many of the same concepts as the Nova, it included support for virtual memory and multitasking more suitable to the small office environment.
Production problems with the Eclipse led to a rash of lawsuits in the late 1970s. Newer versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many of DG&#x27;s customers, which were never delivered. Many customers sued Data General after more than a year of waiting, charging the company with breach of contract, while others simply canceled their orders and went elsewhere. The Eclipse was originally intended to replace the Nova outright, evidenced by the fact that the Nova 3 series, released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the Eclipse, was phased out the next year. Strong demand continued for the Nova series, resulting in the Nova 4, perhaps as a result of the continuing problems with the Eclipse.

===Fountainhead===
While DG was still struggling with Eclipse, in 1977, Digital announced the VAX series, their first 32-bit minicomputer line, described as &quot;super-minis&quot;. This coincided with the aging of DEC&#x27;s 16-bit products, notably the PDP-11, which were coming due for replacement. It appeared there was an enormous potential market for 32-bit machines, one that DG might be able to &quot;scoop&quot;.

Data General immediately launched their own 32-bit effort in 1976 to build what they called the &quot;world&#x27;s best 32-bit machine&quot;, known internally as the &quot;Fountainhead Project&quot;, or FHP for short (Fountain Head Project). Development took place off-site so that even DG workers would not know of it. The developers were given free rein over the design and selected a system that used a writable instruction set. The idea was that the instruction set architecture (ISA) was not fixed, programs could write their own ISA and upload it as microcode to the processor&#x27;s writable control store. This would allow the ISA to be tailored to the programs being run, for instance, one might upload an ISA tuned for COBOL if the company&#x27;s workload included significant numbers of COBOL programs.

When Digital&#x27;s VAX-11/780 was shipped in February 1978, however, Fountainhead was not yet ready to deliver a machine, due mainly to problems in project management. DG&#x27;s customers left quickly for the VAX world.

====Eagle====

In the spring of 1978, with Fountainhead apparently in development hell, a secret skunkworks project was started to develop an alternative 32-bit system known as &quot;Eagle&quot; by a team led by Tom West. References to &quot;the Eagle project&quot; and &quot;Project Eagle&quot; co-exist. Eagle was a straightforward, 32-bit extension of the Nova-based Eclipse. It was backwards-compatible with 16-bit Eclipse applications, used the same command-line interpreter, but offered improved 32-bit performance over the VAX 11/780 while using fewer components.

By late 1979, it became clear that Eagle would deliver before Fountainhead, igniting an intense within the company for constantly shrinking project funds. In the meantime, customers were abandoning Data General in droves, driven not only by the delivery problems with the original Eclipse, including very serious quality control and customer service problems, but also the power and versatility of Digital&#x27;s new VAX line. Ultimately, Fountainhead was cancelled and Eagle became the new MV series, with the first model, the Data General Eclipse MV/8000, announced in April 1980.

The Eagle Project was the subject of Tracy Kidder&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, &quot;The Soul of a New Machine&quot;, making the MV line the best-documented computer project in recent history.

===MV series===

The MV systems generated an almost miraculous turnaround for Data General. Through the early 1980s sales picked up, and by 1984 the company had over a billion dollars in annual sales.

One of Data General&#x27;s significant customers at this time was the United States Forest Service, which starting in the mid-1980s used DG systems installed at all levels from headquarters in Washington, D.C. down to individual ranger stations and fire command posts. This required equipment of high reliability and generally rugged construction that could be deployed in a wide range of places, often to be maintained and used by people with no computer background at all. The intent was to create new kinds of functional integration in an agency that had long prized its decentralized structure. Despite some tensions, the implementation was effective and the overall effects on the agency notably positive. The introduction, implementation, and effects of the DG systems in USFS were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the RAND Corporation.

The MV series came in various iterations, from the MV/2000 (later MV/2500), MV/4000, MV/10000, MV/15000, MV/20000, MV/30000, MV/40000 and ultimately concluded with the MV/60000HA minicomputer. The MV/60000HA was intended to be a High Availability system, with many components duplicated to eliminate the single point of failure. Yet, there were failures among the system&#x27;s many daughter boards, back-plane, and mid-plane. DG technicians were kept quite busy replacing boards and many blamed poor quality control at the DG factory in Mexico where they were made and refurbished.

In retrospect, the nicely performing MV series was too little, too late. At a time when DG invested its last dollar into the dying minicomputer segment, the microcomputer was rapidly making inroads to the lower-end market segment, and the introduction of the first workstations wiped out all 16-bit machines, once DG&#x27;s best customer segment. While the MV series did stop the erosion of DG&#x27;s customer base, this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow DG to develop their next generation. DG had also changed their marketing to focus on direct sales to Fortune 100 companies and thus alienated many resellers.

===Software===
Data General developed operating systems for its hardware: DOS and RDOS for the Nova, RDOS and AOS for the 16-bit Eclipse C, M, and S lines, AOS/VS and AOS/VS II for the Eclipse MV line, and a modified version of UNIX System V called DG/UX for the Eclipse MV and AViiON machines. The AOS/VS software was the most commonly used DG software product and included CLI (Command Line Interpreter) allowing for complex scripting, DUMP/LOAD, and other custom components.

Related system software also in common use at the time included such packages as X.25, Xodiac, and TCP/IP for networking, Fortran, COBOL, RPG, PL/I, C and Data General Business Basic for programming, INFOS II and DG/DBMS for databases, and the nascent relational database software DG/SQL.

Data General also offered an office automation suite named &quot;Comprehensive Electronic Office&quot; (CEO), which included a mail system, a calendar, a folder-based document store, a word processor (CEOWrite), a spreadsheet processor, and other assorted tools. All were crude by today&#x27;s standards, but were revolutionary for their time. CEOWrite was also offered on the DG One Portable.

Some software development from the early 1970s is notable. PLN (created by Robert Nichols) was the host language for a number of DG products, making them easier to develop, enhance, and maintain than macro assembler equivalents. PLN smacked of a micro-subset of PL/I, in sharp contrast to other languages of the time, such as BLISS. The RPG product (shipped in 1976) incorporated a language runtime system implemented as a virtual machine which executed pre-compiled code as sequences of PLN statements and Eclipse commercial instruction routines. The latter provided microcode acceleration of arithmetic and conversion operations for a wide range of now-arcane data types such as overpunch characters. The DG Easy product, a portable application platform developed by Nichols and others from 1975 to 1979 but never marketed, had roots easily traceable back to the RPG VM created by Stephen Schleimer.

Also notable were several commercial software products developed in the mid to late 1970s in conjunction with the commercial computers. These products were popular with business customers because of their screen design feature and other ease-of-use features. 
* The first product was IDEA (Interactive Data Entry/Access), which consisted of a screen design tool (IFMT), TP Controller (IMON), and a program development language (IFPL). 
* The second was the CS40 line of products, which used COBOL and their own ISAM data manager. The COBOL variant used included an added screen section. Both of these products were a major departure from the transaction monitors of the day which did not have a screen design tool and used subroutine calls from COBOL to handle the screen. IDEA was identified by some market watchers as a precursor to fourth-generation programming languages.

The original IDEA ran on RDOS and would support up to 24 users in an RDOS Partition. Each user could use the same or a different program. Eventually, IDEA ran on every commercial hardware product from the MicroNova (4 users) to the MV series under AOS/VS, the same IDEA program running all those systems. The CS40 (the first of this line) was a package system which supported four terminal users, each running a different COBOL program. 
* These products also led to the development of a third product, TPMS (Transaction Processing Monitoring System (announced in 1980)) which could capably run a large number of COBOL or PL/I users with a smaller number of processors, a major resource and performance advantage on AOS and AOS/VS systems. TPMS had the same screen design tool as the earlier products. TPMS used defined subroutine calls for screen functions from COBOL or PL/I, which in some users&#x27; eyes made it more difficult to use. However, this product was aimed at the professional IS Programmers as were its competitors—IBM&#x27;s CICS and DEC&#x27;s TRAX. As with IDEA, TPMS used INFOS for information management and DG/DBMS for database management.

===Xodiac===

In 1979, DG introduced their Xodiac networking system. This was based on the X.25 standard at the lower levels, and their own application layer protocols on top. Because it was based on X.25, remote sites could be linked together over commercial X.25 services like Telenet in the US or Datapac in Canada. Data General software packages supporting Xodiac included Comprehensive Electronic Office (CEO).

In June 1987, Data General announced its intention to replace Xodiac with the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol suite.

===Dasher terminals===

Data General produced a full range of peripherals, sometimes by rebadging printers for example, but Data General&#x27;s own series of CRT-based and hard-copy terminals were high quality and featured a generous number of function keys, each with the ability to send different codes, with any combination of control and shift keys, which influenced WordPerfect design. The model 6053 Dasher 2 featured an easily tilted screen, but used many integrated circuits; the smaller, lighter D100, D200 and eventually the D210 replaced it as the basic user terminal, while graphics models such as the D460 (with ANSI X3.64 compatibility) occupied the very high end of the range. Terminal emulators for the D2/D3/D100/D200/D210 (and some features of the D450/460) do exist, including the Freeware 1993 DOS program in D460.zip.

Most Data General software was written specifically for their own terminals (or the terminal emulation built into the Desktop Generation DG10, but the Data General One built-in terminal emulator is not often suitable), although software using Data General Business BASIC could be more flexible in terminal handling, because logging into a Business BASIC system would initiate a process whereby the terminal type would (usually) be auto-detected.

===Data General/One===
Data General&#x27;s introduction of the Data General/One (DG-1) in 1984 is one of the few cases of a minicomputer company introducing a truly breakthrough PC product. Considered genuinely portable, rather than &quot;luggable&quot;, as alternatives often were called, it was a nine-pound battery-powered MS-DOS machine equipped with dual 3-inch diskettes, a 79-key full-stroke keyboard, 128 KB to 512 KB of RAM, and a monochrome LCD screen capable of either the full-sized standard 80×25 characters or full CGA graphics (640×200). The DG-1 was considered a modest advance over similar Osborne/Kaypro systems overall.

===Desktop Generation===
Data General also brought out a small-footprint &quot;Desktop Generation&quot; range, starting with the DG10 that included both Data General and Intel CPUs in a patented closely coupled arrangement, able to run MS-DOS or CP/M-86 concurrently with DG/RDOS, with each benefiting from the hardware acceleration given by other CPU as a co-processor that would handle (for instance) screen graphics or disk operations concurrently. Other members of the Desktop Generation range, the DG20 and DG30, were aimed more at traditional commercial environments, such as multi-user COBOL systems, replacing refrigerator-sized minicomputers with toaster-sized modular microcomputers based around the microECLIPSE CPUs and some of the technology developed for the microNOVA-based &quot;Micro Products&quot; range such as the MP/100 and MP/200 that had struggled to find a market niche. The Single-processor version of the DG10, the DG10SP, was the entry-level machine with, like the DG20 and 30, no ability to run Intel software. Despite having some good features and having less direct competition from the flood of cheap PC compatibles, the Desktop Generation range also struggled, partly because they offered an economical way of running what was essentially &quot;legacy software&quot; while the future was clearly either slightly cheaper Personal Computers or slightly more expensive &quot;super minicomputers&quot; such as the MV and VAX computers.

===Lock-in or no lock-in?===

Throughout the 1980s, the computer market had evolved dramatically. Large installations in the past typically ran custom-developed software for a small range of tasks. For instance, IBM often delivered machines whose only purpose was to generate accounting data for a single company, running software tailored for that company alone.

By the mid-1980s, the introduction of new software development methods and the rapid acceptance of the SQL database was changing the way such software was developed. Now developers typically linked together several pieces of existing software, as opposed to developing everything from scratch. In this market, the question of which machine was the &quot;best&quot; changed; it was no longer the machine with the best price–performance ratio or service contracts, but the one that ran all of the third-party software the customer intended to use.

This change forced changes on the hardware vendors as well. Formerly, almost all computer companies attempted to make their machines different enough that when their customers sought a more powerful machine, it was often cheaper to buy another from the same company. This was known as &quot;vendor lock-in&quot;, which helped guarantee future sales, even though the customers detested it.

With the change in software development, combined with new generations of commodity processors that could match the performance of low-end minicomputers, lock-in was no longer working. When forced to make a decision, it was often cheaper for the users to simply throw out all of their existing machinery and buy a microcomputer product instead. If this was not the case at present, it certainly appeared it would be within a generation or two of Moore&#x27;s law.

In 1988, two company directors put together a report showing that if the company were to continue existing in the future, DG would have to either invest heavily in software to compete with new applications being delivered by IBM and DEC on their machines, or alternately exit the proprietary hardware business entirely.

Thomas West&#x27;s report outlined these changes in the marketplace, and suggested that the customer was going to win the fight over lock-in. They also outlined a different solution: Instead of trying to compete against the much larger IBM and DEC, they suggested that since the user no longer cared about the hardware as much as software, DG could deliver the best &quot;commodity&quot; machines instead.

&quot;Specifically&quot;, the report stated, &quot;DG should examine the Unix market, where all of the needed software already exists, and see if DG can provide compelling Unix solutions.&quot; Now the customer could run any software they wished as long as it ran on Unix, and by the early 1990s, everything did. As long as DG&#x27;s machines outperformed the competition, their customers would return, because they liked the machines, not because they were forced; lock-in was over.

===AViiON===

De Castro agreed with the report, and future generations of the MV series were terminated. Instead, DG released a technically interesting series of Unix servers known as the AViiON. The name &quot;AViiON&quot; was a reversed play on the name of DG&#x27;s first product, Nova, implying &quot;Nova II&quot;. In an effort to keep costs down, the AViiON was originally designed and shipped with the Motorola 88000 RISC processor. The AViiON machines supported multi-processing, later evolving into NUMA-based systems, allowing the machines to scale upwards in performance by adding additional processors.

===CLARiiON===

An important element in all enterprise computer systems is high speed storage. At the time AViiON came to market, commodity hard disk drives could not offer the sort of performance needed for data center use. DG attacked this problem in the same fashion as the processor issue, by running a large number of drives in parallel. The overall performance was greatly improved and the resulting innovation was marketed originally as the HADA (High Availability Disk Array) and then later as the CLARiiON line. The CLARiiON arrays, which offered SCSI RAID in various capacities, offered a great price/performance and platform flexibility over competing solutions.

The CLARiiON line was marketed not only to AViiON and Data General MV series customers, but also to customers running servers from other vendors such as Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Silicon Graphics. Data General also embarked on a plan to hire storage sales specialists and to challenge the EMC Symmetrix in the wider market.

===Joint venture with Soviet company===
On December 12, 1989, DG and Soviet Union software developer NPO Parma announced Perekat (Перекат, “Rolling Thunder,”) the first joint venture between an American computer company and a Soviet company. DG would provide hardware and NPO Parma the software, and Austrian companies Voest Alpine Industrieanlagenbau and their marketing group Voest Alpine Vertriebe would build the plant.

===Final downturn===
Despite Data General&#x27;s betting the AViiON farm on the Motorola 88000, Motorola decided to end production of that CPU. The 88000 had never been very successful, and DG was the only major customer. When Apple Computer and IBM proposed their joint solution based on POWER architecture, the PowerPC, Motorola picked up the manufacturing contract and killed the 88000.

DG quickly responded by introducing new models of the AViiON series based on a true commodity processor, the Intel x86 series. By this time a number of other vendors, notably Sequent Computer Systems, were also introducing similar machines. The lack of lock-in now came back to haunt DG, and the rapid commoditization of the Unix market led to shrinking sales. DG did begin a minor shift toward the service industry, training their technicians for the role of implementing a spate of new x86-based servers and the new Microsoft Windows NT domain-driven, small server world. This never developed enough to offset the loss of high margin server business however.

Data General also targeted the explosion of the internet in the latter 1990s with the formation of the THiiN Line business unit, led by Tom West, which had a focus on creation and sale of so-called &quot;internet appliances&quot;. The product developed was called the SiteStak web server appliance and was designed as an inexpensive website hosting product.

===EMC takeover===
CLARiiON was the only product line that saw continued success through the later 1990s after finding a large niche for Unix storage systems, and its sales were still strong enough to make DG a takeover target. EMC, the 800-pound gorilla in the storage market, announced in August 1999 that they would buy Data General and its assets for $1.1 billion or $19.58 a share. The acquisition was completed on October 12, 1999.

Although details of the acquisition specified that EMC had to take the entire company, and not just the storage line, EMC quickly ended all development and production of DG computer hardware and parts, effectively ending Data General&#x27;s presence in the segment. The maintenance business was sold to a third party, who also acquired all of DG&#x27;s remaining hardware components for spare parts sales to old DG customers. The CLARiiON line continued to be a major player in the market and was marketed under that name until January 2012. CLARiiON was also widely sold by Dell through a worldwide OEM deal with EMC. The Clariion and Celerra storage products evolved into EMC&#x27;s unified storage platform, the VNX platform.

Data General would be only one of many New England based computer companies, including the original Digital Equipment Corporation, that collapsed or were sold to larger companies after the 1980s. On the Internet, even the old Data General domain (dg.com), which contained a few EMC webpages that only mentioned the latter company in passing, was sold to the Dollar General discount department store chain in October 2009.

==Marketing==
Data General exhibited a brash style of marketing and advertising, which acted to set the company in the spotlight. A memorable advertising campaign during the early 1980s Desktop Generation era, was issuance of T-shirts with the logo &quot;We did it on a desktop&quot;. The early AViiON servers were portrayed as powerful computing in the size of a pizza box.

Data General sponsored the Tyrrell Formula 1 team in the Formula 1 World Championships in 1985, 1986 and 1987, with prominent placing on the team&#x27;s 014, 015 and DG016 cars. The DG016 used in 1987 was prefixed &quot;DG&quot; in deference to Data General.

<doc id="157960" wikidata="Q7986912" url="?curid=157960" title="West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette">
<text>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943), is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court holding that the First Amendment protects students from being forced to salute the American flag or say the Pledge of Allegiance in public school.

&quot;Barnette&quot; overruled a 1940 decision on the same issue, &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot;, in which the court had stated that the proper recourse for dissent was to try to change the public school policy democratically. This was a significant court victory won by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, whose religion forbade them from saluting or pledging to symbols, including symbols of political institutions. The &quot;Barnette&quot; ruling relied on freedom of speech principles rather than freedom of religion.

== Background ==

In the 1930s, the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, began objecting to state laws requiring school students to salute the flag as a means of instilling patriotism, and in 1936 he declared that baptized Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses who saluted the flag were breaking their covenant with God and were committing idolatry. 

Children of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses had been expelled from school and were threatened with exclusion for refusing to salute the American flag. One such expulsion resulted in the Supreme Court case &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot; in 1940, in which the high court sided with school districts and advised dissenting parents to try to change procedures via standard political processes.

In 1942, the West Virginia Board of Education passed a regulation requiring schoolchildren to salute the flag. Recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance was also required. Failure to comply was considered &quot;insubordination&quot; and dealt with by expulsion; the expelled student would then be considered a delinquent, and their parents could be fined up to $50 (about $1000 in 2020 dollars) and jailed up to thirty days.

Marie and Gathie Barnett (whose surname was spelled incorrectly in the court papers) were Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses attending Slip Hill Grade School near Charleston, who were instructed by their father not to salute the flag or recite the pledge. They were expelled for their refusal. Their parents continued to send the girls to school each day, only for the school to send them back home.

The Barnett family filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, alleging that the regulation violated the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the freedoms of speech and religion under the First Amendment, The District Court enjoined enforcement against students. Due to the case&#x27;s constitutional implications, the West Virginia School Board appealed directly to the United States Supreme Court.

== Arguments ==
At the Supreme Court, the School Board argued that the Barnetts raised no substantial federal question, and the Board&#x27;s argument rested upon the &quot;Gobitis&quot; precedent. The Barnett&#x27;s attorney, Hayden Covington, referenced the frequent persecution of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses via statutes like that in West Virginia, and argued that the &quot;Gobitis&quot; precedent should be overturned because it enabled states to pass discriminatory laws.

The American Bar Association and the American Civil Liberties Union filed &quot;amicus curiae &quot; briefs arguing that &quot;Gobitis&quot; was bad law and should be overruled. 

== Decision of the court ==
The court, in a 6–3 decision delivered by Justice Robert H. Jackson, held that it was unconstitutional for public schools to compel students to salute the flag. It thus overruled its decision in &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot; just three years earlier, finding that the flag salute was &quot;a form of utterance&quot; and &quot;a primitive but effective means of communicating ideas&quot;, and therefore was speech to which the First Amendment applied. The court wrote that any &quot;compulsory unification of opinion&quot; was doomed to failure and was antithetical to free speech values. In Jackson&#x27;s words:
Jackson intricately refuted the arguments that had been made in the &quot;Gobitis&quot; precedent. First, Jackson rejected the previous court&#x27;s holding that the United States flag was a national symbol, stating that symbols are merely the prelude to speech, and that &quot;a person gets from a symbol the meaning he puts into it, and what is one man&#x27;s comfort and inspiration is another&#x27;s jest and scorn&quot;. Second, Jackson rejected the holding that flag-saluting ceremonies were an appropriate way to build &quot;cohesive sentiment&quot; for national unity, warning that &quot;Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves exterminating dissenters. Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard.&quot;

On the &quot;Gobitis&quot; holding that those who disagreed with a school board&#x27;s regulation through political processes, Jackson argued that the conflict at issue was between authority and the individual, and that the Founding Fathers intended the Bill of Rights to protect minority rights from the whims of a majority. Jackson wrote:

Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas wrote a concurring opinion to explain their reasons for changing their view from the prior &quot;Gobitis&quot; decision, in which both had joined the majority. In their concurring opinion, they expanded upon the futility of pledges and oaths as means to build patriotism. &quot;Love of country must spring from willing hearts and free minds, inspired by a fair administration of wise laws enacted by the people&#x27;s elected representatives within the bounds of express constitutional prohibitions.&quot;

=== Dissenting opinion ===
The Justice who had written the &quot;Gobitis&quot; ruling in 1940 – Felix Frankfurter – strongly disagreed with how that precedent was being overturned in the &quot;Barnette&quot; ruling. Frankfurter reinforced his holding in &quot;Gobitis&quot; that those who disagree with a law should attempt to change it through the political process, rather than break that law due to religious conscience. &quot;Otherwise each individual could set up his own censor against obedience to laws conscientiously deemed for the public good by those whose business it is to make laws.&quot; Thus, Frankfurter believed that the &quot;Barnette&quot; majority overstepped in striking down the West Virginia law, which had been passed by elected legislators.

Frankfurter&#x27;s dissent was written from the perspective of his own Jewish roots, showing sympathy for other persecuted religious minorities but taking a impartial legal and unconstitutional view of the dispute and exercising judicial restraint. Fellow Justices Owen Roberts and Frank Murphy advised Frankfurter to tone down the personal dimensions of his dissent, but he refused. 

== Impact ==
The Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling on &quot;Barnette&quot; is considered a crucial precedent on the freedoms established by the Bill of Rights and the risk of governments restricting them via discriminatory laws. It is considered to be a formative precedent on not just freedom of religion; but also on the matter of compelled speech, as governments attempt to coerce citizens into taking oaths when they would not do so under their own free will, particularly for religious reasons. 

In a 2006 commemorative event cosponsored by the Justice Robert H. Jackson Center and the Supreme Court Historical Society, Supreme Court law clerks from the &quot;Barnette&quot; court were on a panel with the two eponymous Barnettes. Just as she and her sister had been in 1942, Gathie Barnett Edmonds noted that her own son was also sent to the principal&#x27;s office for not saluting the flag.

<text>Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586 (1940), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States restricting the religious rights of public school students under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court ruled that public schools could compel students—in this case, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses—to salute the American flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance despite the students&#x27; religious objections to these practices. This decision led to increased persecution of Witnesses in the United States. The Supreme Court overruled this decision three years later in &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;(1943).

Subsequent cases have applied a lower standard of review to generally applicable laws when evaluating free exercise claims; Justice Antonin Scalia cited Frankfurter&#x27;s &quot;Gobitis&quot; opinion at least three times in &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot; (1990).

== Background ==

=== Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and compulsory flag pledges ===
Mandatory flag pledges in public schools were motivated by patriotic fervor in the wartime United States. The first known mandatory flag pledges were instituted in a number of states during the Spanish–American War. During World War I, many more states instituted mandatory flag pledges with only a few dissents recorded by the American Civil Liberties Union.

On June 3, 1935, Watch Tower Society president J. F. Rutherford was interviewed at a Witness convention about &quot;the flag salute by children in school&quot;. He told the convention audience that to salute an earthly emblem, ascribing salvation to it, was unfaithfulness to God. Rutherford said that he would not do it. While the matter was not yet established doctrine or written policy of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, at least some Witness families quickly made a personal conscientious decision on the matter.

In September in Lynn, Massachusetts, a third-grader and a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness named Carleton Nichols refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and was expelled from school. The Nichols incident received widespread media attention, and other Witness students soon followed suit. Rutherford gave a radio address praising Nichols, and schools around the country began expelling Witness students and firing Witness teachers. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses published the booklet &quot;Loyalty&quot;, making the matter an official doctrine of the faith before the end of 1935. Witnesses hired teachers and set up &quot;Kingdom schools&quot; to continue their children&#x27;s education.

The national leadership subsequently decided to make an issue of the forced pledges and asked people to stand up for their right to religious freedom.

=== Facts of the case ===
Walter Gobitas had recently converted to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Gobitas was inspired by stories of other Witnesses who challenged the system and suffered for it, and decided to make a stand himself and instructed his children not to pledge allegiance when at school.

Minersville, Pennsylvania, was predominantly Roman Catholic and there was significant animosity towards Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Tensions were already high before this case arose, and many viewed this as one way to get back at the Witnesses. As a result, his children were subjected to teasing, taunting, and attacks from the other kids. For Lillian, this meant giving up her status as class president and losing most of her friends. &quot;When I&#x27;d come to school,&quot; she said, &quot;they would throw a hail of pebbles and yell things like, &#x27;Here comes Jehovah!&#x27;&quot; Billy&#x27;s fifth-grade teacher attempted to physically force his arm out of his pocket to make the requisite salute.

A local Catholic church started a boycott of the family store and its business dropped off. Because of their eventual expulsion, their father had to pay for them to enroll in a private school, resulting in even more economic hardship.

At first, the school board was in a quandary because the law did not provide penalties for those who refused to pledge. Finally, though, the school board got permission to punish the Gobitas children and expelled them, without appeal.

=== Trial ===
The case was argued in Philadelphia on February 15, 1938. During the trial, school superintendent Roudabush displayed contempt for the beliefs of the children, stating that he felt they had been &quot;indoctrinated&quot; and that the existence of even a few dissenters would be &quot;demoralizing&quot;, leading to widespread disregard for the flag and American values. Four months later District Judge Albert B. Maris found that the board&#x27;s requirement that the children salute the flag was an unconstitutional violation of their free exercise of religious beliefs.

=== Third Circuit ===

Within two weeks, the school board unanimously agreed to appeal the decision. Oral arguments in the appeal were made before the Third Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals on November 9, 1938. One year later, the three-judge court unanimously affirmed the district court decision.

Despite its two defeats in the lower courts, the school board decided to take its case to the Supreme Court, authorizing its attorney to file a petition for a writ of certiorari, which the Court granted on March 4, 1940.

=== Oral argument ===

The Court heard oral arguments on April 25. Joseph Rutherford, president of the Watch Tower Society,
and himself a lawyer, took over the defense, assisted by the new head of the religious group&#x27;s Legal Department, Hayden Covington. The ACLU and the Committee on the Bill of Rights of the American Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs.

== Opinion of the court ==

The Court&#x27;s June 3 decision was nearly unanimous: only Justice Harlan F. Stone dissented. In an 8-to-1 decision, the Court upheld the mandatory flag salute, declining to make itself &quot;the school board for the country.&quot;

Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote the majority decision; in doing so, he relied primarily on the &quot;secular regulation&quot; rule, which weighs the secular purpose of a nonreligious government regulation against the religious practice it makes illegal or otherwise burdens the exercise of religion. He identified the Pennsylvania flag-salute requirement as an intrinsically secular policy enacted to encourage patriotism among school children.

Frankfurter wrote that the school district&#x27;s interest in creating national unity was enough to allow them to require students to salute the flag. According to Frankfurter, the nation needed loyalty and the unity of all the people. Since saluting the flag was a primary means of achieving this legitimate goal, an issue of national importance was at stake.

The Court held that the state&#x27;s interest in &quot;national cohesion&quot; was &quot;inferior to none in the hierarchy of legal values&quot;.
National unity is the basis of national security. To deny the legislature the right to select appropriate means for its attainment presents a totally different order of problem from that of the propriety of subordinating the possible ugliness of littered streets to the free expression opinion through handbills.
Weighing the circumstances in this case, he argued that the social need for conformity with the requirement was greater than the individual liberty claims of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. He emphasized that
Conscientious scruples have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration, relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs
Frankfurter further wrote that the recitation of a pledge advanced the cause of patriotism in the United States. He said the country&#x27;s foundation as a free society depends upon building sentimental ties.

The flag, the Court found, was an important symbol of national unity and could be a part of legislative initiatives designed &quot;to promote in the minds of children who attend the common schools an attachment to the institutions of their country.&quot;
=== Dissenting opinion ===
Harlan Stone, relying on the argument he had put forth in the famous Footnote Four, was the lone dissenter from the majority&#x27;s decision, writing:
== Effects of the decision ==
On June 9, a mob of 2,500 burned the Kingdom Hall in Kennebunkport, Maine. On June 16, Litchfield, Illinois police jailed all of that town&#x27;s sixty Witnesses, ostensibly protecting them from their neighbors. On June 18, townspeople in Rawlins, Wyoming brutally beat five Witnesses; on June 22, the people of Parco, Wyoming tarred and feathered another.

The American Civil Liberties Union reported to the Justice Department that nearly 1,500 Witnesses were physically attacked in more than 300 communities nationwide. One Southern sheriff told a reporter why Witnesses were being run out of town: &quot;They&#x27;re traitors; the Supreme Court says so. Ain&#x27;t you heard?&quot;

First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt appealed publicly for calm, while newspaper editorials and the American legal community condemned the &quot;Gobitis&quot; decision as a blow to liberty. On June 8, 1942, Supreme Court Justices Black, Douglas and Murphy stated in their opinion on &quot;Jones v. City of Opelika&quot; that, although they had concurred with the majority in the &quot;Gobitis&quot; case, they now believed that that case had been wrongly decided.

== Subsequent history ==
Partly because of the violent reaction to its decision, including the lynching of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, the ruling did not stand for long. Frank Murphy in particular regretted his decision, and instructed his clerk to look out for an opportunity to revisit the issue. The elevation of Harlan Fiske Stone to Chief Justice, and the appointment of two new members to the Supreme Court, were also factors in the Court&#x27;s reversal of policy.

On 14 June 1943 (Flag Day), the court handed down &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;. In addition to Murphy, Justices Black and Douglas also reversed their opinions, resulting in a 6–3 vote. The majority opinion written by Robert Jackson echoed Justice Stone&#x27;s dissent when he wrote, &quot;If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion&quot;.

The active persecution of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses abated somewhat, although thousands were arrested during World War II for seeking religious exemption from military service. They were accused of being unpatriotic, and even of being Nazi sympathizers.

Subsequent cases have applied a lower standard of review to generally applicable laws when evaluating free exercise claims; Justice Antonin Scalia cited Frankfurter&#x27;s &quot;Gobitis&quot; opinion at least three times in &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot; (1990).

<doc id="157963" wikidata="Q1316530" url="?curid=157963" title="Humphry Repton">
<text>Humphry Repton (21 April 1752 – 24 March 1818) was the last great designer of the classic phase of the English landscape garden, often regarded as the successor to Capability Brown. His style is thought of as the precursor of the more intricate and eclectic styles of the 19th century. His first name is often incorrectly spelt &quot;Humphrey&quot;.

Unlike Brown and other famous predecessors, he only worked as a designer, not the contractor for executing his designs, and therefore made much less money. Many of his famous sketches with folding sections survive; these gave &quot;before and after&quot; views for his clients. He appears to be the first person to describe himself (on his business card) as a landscape gardener.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Repton was born in Bury St Edmunds, the son of a collector of excise, John Repton, and Martha (&quot;née&quot; Fitch of Moor Hall,Stoke by Clare, Suffolk). In 1762, his father set up a transport business in Norwich, where Humphry attended Norwich Grammar School. At age twelve, he was sent to the Netherlands to learn Dutch and prepare for a career as a merchant. However, Repton was befriended by a wealthy Dutch family and the trip may have done more to stimulate his interest in &#x27;polite&#x27; pursuits such as sketching and gardening.

Returning to Norwich, Repton was apprenticed to a textile merchant, then, after marriage to Mary Clarke in 1773, set up in the business himself. He was not successful, and when his parents died in 1778 used his modest legacy to move to a small country estate at Sustead, near Cromer in Norfolk. Repton tried his hand as a journalist, dramatist, artist, political agent, and as confidential secretary to his neighbour William Windham of Felbrigg Hall during Windham&#x27;s very brief stint as Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Repton also joined John Palmer in a venture to reform the mail-coach system, but while the scheme ultimately made Palmer&#x27;s fortune, Repton again lost money.

Repton&#x27;s childhood friend was the botanist James Edward Smith, who encouraged him to study botany and gardening; Smith reproduces a long letter from Repton in his &quot;Letter and Correspondence&quot;. He was given access to the library of Windham to read its works on botany.

===Landscape gardener===

His capital dwindling, Repton moved to a modest cottage at Hare Street near Romford in Essex. In 1788, aged 36 and with four children and no secure income, he hit on the idea of combining his sketching skills with his limited experience of laying out grounds at Sustead to become a &#x27;landscape gardener&#x27; (a term he himself coined). Since the death of Capability Brown in 1783, no one figure dominated English garden design; Repton was ambitious to fill this gap and sent circulars round his contacts in the upper classes advertising his services. He was at first an avid defender of Brown&#x27;s views, contrasted with those of Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale Price, but later adopted a moderate position. His first paid commission was Catton Park, to the north of Norwich, in 1788.

That Repton, with no real experience of practical horticulture, became an overnight success, is a tribute to his undeniable talent, but also to the unique way he presented his work. To help clients visualise his designs, Repton produced &#x27;Red Books&#x27; (so called for their binding) with explanatory text and watercolours with a system of overlays to show &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; views. In this he differed from Capability Brown, who worked almost exclusively with plans and rarely illustrated or wrote about his work. Repton&#x27;s overlays were soon copied by the Philadelphian Bernard M&#x27;Mahon in his 1806 &quot;American Gardener&#x27;s Calendar&quot;.

To understand what was unique about Repton it is useful to examine how he differed from Brown in more detail. Brown worked for many of the wealthiest aristocrats in Britain, carving huge landscape parks out of old formal gardens and agricultural land. While Repton worked for equally important clients, such as the Dukes of Bedford and Portland, he was usually fine-tuning earlier work, often that of Brown himself. Where Repton got the chance to lay out grounds from scratch it was generally on a much more modest scale. On these smaller estates, where Brown would have surrounded the park with a continuous perimeter belt, Repton cut vistas through to &#x27;borrowed&#x27; items such as church towers, making them seem part of the designed landscape (coincidentally a concept common in East Asian gardening). He contrived approach drives and lodges to enhance impressions of size and importance, and even introduced monogrammed milestones on the roads around some estates, for which he was satirised by Thomas Love Peacock as &#x27;Marmaduke Milestone, esquire, a Picturesque Landscape Gardener&#x27; in his novella &quot;Headlong Hall&quot;.

Around 1787, Richard Page (1748–1803), landowner of Sudbury, to the west of Wembley decided to convert the Page family home &#x27;Wellers&#x27; into a country seat and turn the fields around it into a private estate. In 1792 Page employed Humphry Repton, by then famous as a landscape architect, to convert the previous farmland into wooded parkland and to make improvements to the house. Repton often called the areas he landscaped &#x27;parks&#x27;, and so it is to Repton that Wembley Park owes its name. The original site that Repton so transformed was later built on in the construction of the short-lived Watkin&#x27;s Tower, intended to be taller than the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The area landscaped by Repton was larger than the current Wembley Park. It included the southern slopes of Barn Hill to the north, where Repton planted trees and started building a &#x27;prospect house&#x27; – a Gothic tower offering a view over the parkland. Repton may also have designed the thatched lodge that survives on Wembley Hill Road, to the west of Wembley Park. It is in the cottage orné style frequently used by Repton. Regrettably, Repton&#x27;s Red Book for Wembley Park, which would give a definitive answer, has not survived.

Capability Brown was a large-scale contractor, who not only designed, but also arranged the realisation of his work. By contrast, Repton acted as a consultant, charging for his Red Books and sometimes staking out the ground, but leaving his client to arrange the actual execution. Thus many of Repton&#x27;s 400 or so designs remained wholly or partially unexecuted and, while Brown became very wealthy, Repton&#x27;s income was never more than comfortable.

Early in his career, Repton defended Brown&#x27;s reputation during the &#x27;picturesque controversy&#x27;. In 1794 Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale Price simultaneously published vicious attacks on the &#x27;meagre genius of the bare and bald&#x27;, criticising his smooth, serpentine curves as bland and unnatural and championing rugged and intricate designs, composed according to &#x27;picturesque&#x27; principles of landscape painting. Repton&#x27;s defence of Brown rested partly on the impracticality of many picturesque ideas; as a professional, Repton had to produce practical and useful designs for his clients.

Paradoxically, however, as his career progressed Repton drew more and more on picturesque ideas. One major criticism of Brown&#x27;s landscapes was the lack of a formal setting for the house, with rolling lawns sweeping right up to the front door. Repton re-introduced formal terraces, balustrades, trellis work and flower gardens around the house in a way that became common practice in the nineteenth century. He also designed one of the most famous &#x27;picturesque&#x27; landscapes in Britain at Blaise Castle, near Bristol. At Woburn Abbey, Repton foreshadowed another nineteenth-century development, creating themed garden areas including a Chinese garden, American garden, arboretum and forcing garden. At Stoneleigh Abbey in 1808, Repton foreshadowed another nineteenth-century development, creating a perfect cricket pitch called &#x27;home lawn&#x27; in front of the west wing, and a bowling green lawn between the gatehouse and the house.

Success at Woburn earned him a further commission from the Duke of Bedford. He designed the central gardens in Russell Square, the centrepiece of the Bloomsbury development. The gardens were restored with the additional help of archaeological investigation and archive photographs, to the original plans and are now listed as Grade II by Historic England. The square was to be a flagship commission for Repton and was only one of three within the central London.

Buildings played an important part in many of Repton&#x27;s landscapes. In the 1790s he often worked with the relatively unknown architect John Nash, whose loose compositions suited Repton&#x27;s style. Nash benefited greatly from the exposure, while Repton received a commission on building work. Around 1800, however, the two fell out, probably over Nash&#x27;s refusal to credit the work of Repton&#x27;s architect son John Adey Repton. Thereafter John Adey and Repton&#x27;s younger son George Stanley Repton often worked with their father, although George continued to work in Nash&#x27;s office as well. It must have been particularly painful for Repton when Nash secured the prestigious work to remodel the Royal Pavilion at Brighton for the Prince Regent, for which Repton himself submitted innovative proposals in an Indian style.

===Death and legacy===

On 29 November 1811 Repton suffered a serious carriage accident which often left him needing to use a wheelchair for mobility. He died at age 65 in 1818 and is buried in the graveyard of the Church of St Michael, Aylsham, Norfolk.

Three roads close to the vicinity of his cottage at Hare Street (now renamed Main Road) in the Gidea Park area of Romford were named after him; Repton Avenue, Repton Gardens and Repton Drive, respectively. A plaque was unveiled on the former site of his cottage on 19 April 1969. The cottage was long since demolished and a branch of Lloyds TSB is situated on the junction of Hare Street and Balgores Lane.

In addition to his innovations in landscape architecture, Repton&#x27;s 1803 quote &quot;the thorn is the mother of the oak&quot; has become a tenet of rewilding, where thorny plants are used to protect young native saplings from overbrowsing by rabbits and deer.

==Publications==
Repton published three major books on garden design: &quot;Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening&quot; (1795), &quot;Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening&quot; (1803), and &quot;Fragments on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening&quot; (1816). These drew on material and techniques used in the Red Books.

Several lesser works were also published, including a posthumous collection edited by John Claudius Loudon, despite having severely criticised his approach to gardens.

His published titles were:
* &quot;Hundreds of North and South Erpingham,&quot; a part of the &quot;History of Norfolk,&quot; 1781, vol. iii. I
* &quot;Variety, a Collection of Essays&quot; [anon. By Repton and a few friends], 1788.
* &quot;The Bee: a Critique on Paintings at Somerset House,&quot; 1788. 
* &quot;The Bee; or a Companion to the Shakespeare Gallery,&quot; 1789. 
* &quot;Letter to Uvedale Price,&quot; 1794. 
* &quot;Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening,&quot; 1794. This volume contained details, with numerous illustrations, of the different gardens and plantations which he had formed. He defends himself in chap. vii. and in an appendix from the criticisms of Knight and Price, and reprints his &quot;Letter to Uvedale Price.&quot; Only 250 copies were printed, and the work has fetched more than four times the original price. 
* &quot;Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening,’ 1803. 
* &quot;Odd Whims and Miscellanies,&quot; 1804, 2 vols. They were dedicated to Windham. Some of the essays in &quot;Variety&quot; were reprinted in this collection, and in the second volume is a comedy of &quot;Odd Whims,&quot; which was played at Ipswich. 
* &quot;An Inquiry into the Changes of Taste in Landscape Gardening, with some Observations on its Theory and Practice,&quot; 1806; it also included his letter to Price. 
* &quot;Designs for the Pavilion at Brighton,&quot; 1808. He was assisted in this by his sons, John Adey and George Stanley Repton. The plans were approved by the Prince of Wales, but, through want of funds, were not carried out. 
* &quot;On the Introduction of Indian Architecture and Gardening,&quot; 1808. 
* &quot;Fragments on Landscape Gardening, with some Remarks on Grecian and Gothic Architecture,&quot; 1816. In this work his son, J. A. Repton, gave him assistance.

Repton contributed to the &quot;Transactions of the Linnean Society,&quot; xi. 27, a paper &quot;On the supposed Effect of Ivy upon Trees.&quot;

== Bicentenary celebrations in 2018 ==
The Gardens Trust was awarded a Heritage Lottery Fund grant to run a ‘Sharing Repton’ project in 2018–19, working with volunteers to deliver five projects aimed at including participation from local communities, based around five Repton sites across the country. The project took place at Kenwood, London, with London Parks and Gardens Trust and English Heritage; Wicksteed Park, Kettering, with Northamptonshire Gardens Trust; Catton Park, with Norfolk Gardens Trust and Broadland District Council; Blaise Castle, Bristol, with Avon Gardens Trust, and Warley Woods in the Black Country. A record of the project and the resources developed to make garden history more publicly accessible were published in 2020.

Historic England have added Humphry Repton&#x27;s landscapes to their interactive map of aerial photography of Designed Landscapes and commissioned Hardy Plants and Plantings for Repton and Late Georgian Gardens (1780–1820) which draws on research carried out on plants and planting schemes for late Georgian gardens (1780–1820) and conservation projects, intended to provide a plant list as a starting point for researchers and those restoring gardens of this period.

<doc id="157965" wikidata="Q816295" url="?curid=157965" title="Belvoir Castle">
<text>Belvoir Castle ( ) is a faux historic castle and stately home in Leicestershire, England, situated west of the town of Grantham and northeast of Melton Mowbray. A castle was first built on the site immediately after the Norman Conquest of 1066 and has since been rebuilt at least three times. The final building is a grade I listed mock castle, dating from the early 19th century. It is the seat of David Manners, 11th Duke of Rutland (the tiny county of Rutland lies south of Belvoir Castle), whose direct male ancestor inherited it in 1508. The traditional burial place of the Manners family was in the parish church of St Mary the Virgin, Bottesford, situated to the north of the Castle, but since 1825 they have been buried in the ducal mausoleum built next to the Castle in that year, to which their ancient monuments were moved. It remains the private property of the Duke of Rutland but is open to the general public.

The castle is situated at the extreme northern corner of the county of Leicestershire and is sandwiched between Lincolnshire to the east and Nottinghamshire to the west, and overlooks the Vale of Belvoir to the northwest on the Nottinghamshire border. It is surrounded by the villages of Redmile, Woolsthorpe, Knipton, Harston, Harlaxton, Croxton Kerrial and Bottesford. The antiquarian John Leland (d.1552) stated: &quot;the Castle stands on the very nape of a high hill, steep up each way, partly by nature, partly by the working of men&#x27;s hands&quot;. 

The 15,000 acre (6,000 hectare) Belvoir estate, situated in the heart of England&#x27;s fox-hunting terrain is the headquarters of the Belvoir Hunt (&quot;the Duke of Rutland&#x27;s Hounds&quot;), established in 1750 and now kennelled southeast of the Castle.

==Name==
The castle&#x27;s name Belvoir means &quot;beautiful view&quot; in Norman French. Emma Manners, Duchess of Rutland has said the name &quot;Belvoir&quot; was brought over by the French-speaking Normans in the 11th century. As the Middle English–speaking Anglo-Saxons were unable to pronounce the name, they preferred to call it &quot;Beaver Castle&quot;a usage which persists today.

==History==
===Norman fortification===

A Norman castle originally stood on the high ground within the wapentake of Framland, overlooking the adjacent wapentake of Winnibriggs in Lincolnshire and dominating both. It was built on the land of Robert de Todeni, mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, and inherited from him by William d&#x27;Aubigny. It eventually passed to William&#x27;s granddaughter Isabel, who married Robert de Ros .

Belvoir was a royal manor until it was granted to Robert de Ros in 1257. He was given a licence to crenellate in 1267. When the male de Ros line died out in 1508, the manor and castle passed to George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros, nephew of the last baron de Ros, who inherited the castle and barony through his mother. His son was created Earl of Rutland in 1525.

=== Tudor manor ===
By 1464, the Norman castle was recorded to be ruins. In 1528, Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland started construction of a large Tudor manor house. It was completed in 1555. Much of the stone for this building came from Croxton Abbey and Belvoir Priory following their dissolution.

Two local carpenters refurbished the billiard table in 1602 and a new baize cloth was bought from a merchant in Grantham. James VI and I, Prince Henry and the Venetian ambassador Antonio Foscarini stayed in August 1612. In the early 17th century, servants Joan, Margaret and Phillipa Flower were accused of murdering the 6th Earl&#x27;s two young sons by witchcraft. Joan died while in prison and Margaret and Phillipa were hanged.

During the English Civil War, it was one of the more notable strongholds of the king&#x27;s supporters and King Charles spent a night here on his way into Lincolnshire.

===Country house===
In 1649, the Tudor building was razed by Parliamentarians because of the family&#x27;s support for the Royalists. But six years later, construction on a large family home - designed by the architect John Webb - was started in 1654. Work was completed by 1668 and cost £11,730 (£ million today).

The 9th Earl was created Duke of Rutland in 1703. Belvoir Castle has been the home of the Manners family for five hundred years and seat of the Dukes of Rutland for over three centuries.

=== Georgian revival ===

In 1799, the 5th Duke of Rutland married Lady Elizabeth Howard. The new Duchess of Rutland soon chose architect James Wyatt to rebuild the castle in the romantic Gothic Revival style. The Duke, one of the wealthiest landholders in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, sold seven assorted villages and their surrounding lands to fund the massive project. The project was nearing completion when, on 26 October 1816, it was almost destroyed by a fire. The loss - including pictures by Titian, Rubens, van Dyck, and Reynolds - was estimated at £120,000 (£ million today).

Rebuilt, again, to largely the same designs, at a cost of an additional £82,000 (£ million today), the castle was largely completed by 1832. The architect Sir James Thornton (who was the Duke&#x27;s friend and chaplain and Vicar of nearby Bottesford) was chiefly responsible for this rebuilding, and the result bears a superficial resemblance to a medieval castle, its central tower reminiscent of Windsor Castle.

Whilst visiting Belvoir castle in the 1840s, Anna, Duchess of Bedford, found that the normal time for dinner was between 7:00 and 8:30 p.m. An extra meal called luncheon had been created to fill the midday gap between breakfast and dinner, but as this new meal was very light, the long afternoon with no refreshment at all left people feeling hungry. She found a light meal of tea (usually Darjeeling) and cakes or sandwiches was the perfect balance. The Duchess found taking an afternoon snack to be such a perfect refreshment that she soon began inviting her friends to join her. Afternoon tea quickly became an established and convivial repast in many middle and upper class households.

The castle is open to the public and contains many works of art. The highlights of the tour are the lavish state rooms, the most famous being the Elizabeth Saloon (named after the wife of the 5th Duke), the Regents Gallery and the Roman-inspired State Dining Room.

The Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers regimental museum of the 17th and 21st Lancers was established here in 1964, but was required to leave in October 2007. The Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire Yeomanry Museum is now at Thoresby Hall.

==Estate==
The castle sits in an estate of almost .

===Gardens===

Belvoir Gardens were designed and landscaped by Elizabeth Howard, 5th Duchess of Rutland, who was married to John Manners, the 5th Duke of Rutland. They were created in 1799, the year Belvoir Castle was built. There are many unusual features to the gardens, for example the natural amphitheatre which faces the estate was formed by the moraines of glaciers and a &#x27;root house&#x27; or summer house which survives to this day. This natural amphitheatre is embedded with fresh water springs to ensure blooming plants throughout the year.

Belvoir Gardens were also the first site of mass spring flower bedding, a concept developed by Mr Divers, head gardener of the gardens at the time.

The once thriving gardens are now slowly being restored to their former glory. &quot;Friends of Belvoir Gardens&quot; is a programme which encourages enthusiasts with green fingers to volunteer to help manage the beautifully preserved gardens.

==Mausoleum==
The traditional burial place of the Manners family was St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Bottesford, which houses the monuments of all eight Earls of Rutland. Since elevation to the dukedom in 1703 most Dukes have been buried in the grounds of the mausoleum at Belvoir Castle. The mausoleum at Belvoir Castle was built by The 5th Duke of Rutland, following the death of his wife, Elizabeth Howard (1780–1825), daughter of The 5th Earl of Carlisle. After its construction, most of the 18th century monuments in Bottesford church were moved to the mausoleum which then became the family&#x27;s main place of burial.

===Burials===
The following members of the Manners family are buried in the mausoleum:
*John Manners, 1st Duke of Rutland
*John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland
*John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland
*Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland
*John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland
*Marion Margaret Violet Lindsay Manners, Duchess of Rutland
*Duff Cooper, 1st Viscount Norwich, son-in-law of the 8th Duke
*Diana Cooper, Viscountess Norwich
*Charles Manners, 10th Duke of Rutland

==In literature==
*Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poem is inscribed to Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley, daughter of John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland. The poem illustrates a painting by Thomas Allom.
*In 2012, Catherine Bailey published a history of Belvoir Castle chronicling a mystery surrounding one of its occupants, John Manners, the 9th Duke of Rutland, which she encountered and worked to unravel while researching in the estate&#x27;s archives.

==Present use==
A portion of the castle is still used as the family home of the Manners family. Several films and television programmes have used it as a location including &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; (1980), &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1985), &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; (2007), &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story&quot; (2001), the 1999 version of &quot;The Haunting&quot;, &quot;King Ralph&quot; (1991), &quot;The Crown&quot;, and an episode of Rosie and Jim (1999).

The grounds are used by the Belvoir Cricket Club and for the hosting of events including, in 2009, the CLA Game Fair. Each year since 2013 (with the exception of 2020 due to Covid restrictions), over the autumnal equinox the Equinox24, a 24-hour ultra marathon, has been held, with runners covering a circuit through the country estate, with the castle as a backdrop. In November 2014, Emma Manners, Duchess of Rutland appointed Timothy Grayson as the castle&#x27;s poet-in-residence. Briery Wood Heronry is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in the grounds. In August 2010, the castle&#x27;s website was mistakenly hacked and taken over by an Algerian group who blanked the pages and inserted anti-Semitic texts in Arabic. The hackers had mistaken Belvoir Castle for Belvoir Fortress, which is located in Israel.

<text>The Lambeth Conference convenes as the Archbishop of Canterbury summons an assembly of Anglican bishops every ten years. The first took place at Lambeth in 1867.

As regional and national churches freely associate with the Anglican Communion, the Conferences serve a collaborative and consultative function, expressing &quot;the mind of the communion&quot; on issues of the day. While their resolutions carry no lawful authority, &quot;Its statements on social issues have influenced church policy in the churches.&quot;

These conferences form one of the four Instruments of Communion.

==Origins==
The idea of these meetings was first suggested in a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury by Bishop John Henry Hopkins of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont in 1851. The possibility of such an international gathering of bishops had first emerged during the jubilee of the Church Missionary Society in 1851 when a number of US bishops were present in London. However, the initial impetus came from episcopal churches in Canada. In 1865 the synod of that province, in an urgent letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury, (Charles Thomas Longley), represented the unsettlement of members of the Canadian church caused by recent legal decisions of the Privy Council and their alarm lest the revived action of convocation &quot;should leave us governed by canons different from those in force in England and Ireland, and thus cause us to drift into the status of an independent branch of the Catholic Church&quot;. They therefore requested him to call a &quot;national synod of the bishops of the Anglican Church at home and abroad&quot;, to meet under his leadership. After consulting both houses of the Convocation of Canterbury, Archbishop Longley assented and convened all the bishops of the Anglican Communion (then 144 in number) to meet at Lambeth in 1867.

Many Anglican bishops (amongst them the Archbishop of York and most of his suffragans) felt so doubtful as to the wisdom of such an assembly that they refused to attend it, and Dean Stanley declined to allow Westminster Abbey to be used for the closing service, giving as his reasons the partial character of the assembly, uncertainty as to the effect of its measures and &quot;the presence of prelates not belonging to our Church&quot;.

Archbishop Longley said in his opening address, however, that they had no desire to assume &quot;the functions of a general synod of all the churches in full communion with the Church of England&quot;, but merely to &quot;discuss matters of practical interest, and pronounce what we deem expedient in resolutions which may serve as safe guides to future action&quot;.

The resolutions of the Lambeth Conferences have never been regarded as synodical decrees, but &quot;their weight has increased with each conference.&quot;

Seventy-six bishops accepted the primate&#x27;s invitation to the first conference, which met at Lambeth on 24 September 1867 and sat for four days, the sessions being in private. The archbishop opened the conference with an address: deliberation followed; committees were appointed to report on special questions; resolutions were adopted, and an encyclical letter was addressed to the faithful of the Anglican Communion. Each of the subsequent conferences has been first received in Canterbury Cathedral and addressed by the archbishop from the chair of St Augustine.

From the Second Conference, they have then met at Lambeth Palace, and after sitting for five days for deliberation upon the fixed subjects and appointment of committees, have adjourned, to meet again at the end of a fortnight and sit for five days more, to receive reports, adopt resolutions and to issue their encyclical letter.

From 1978 onwards the conference has been held on the Canterbury campus of the University of Kent allowing the bishops to live and worship together on the same site for the first time. In 1978 the bishops&#x27; spouses were accommodated at the nearby St Edmund&#x27;s School (an Anglican private school); this separation of spouses was not felt helpful. Since 1988 the spouses have also lived at the university.

==Conferences==

===First: 1867===
*Presided over by: Charles Thomas Longley
*76 bishops were present.

The Archbishop of York and several other English bishops refused to attend because they thought such a conference would cause &quot;increased confusion&quot; about controversial issues.

The conference began with a celebration of the Holy Communion at which Henry John Whitehouse, the second Bishop of Illinois, preached; Wilberforce of Oxford later described the sermon as &quot;wordy but not devoid of a certain impressiveness&quot;.

The first session convened in the upstairs Dining Room (known as the Guard Room). The session was spent discussing a &quot;preamble to the subsequent resolutions&quot; that would be issued after the conference.

Day two was spent on a discussion of synodical authority concluding that the faith and unity of the Anglican Communion would be best maintained by there being a synod above those of the &quot;several branches&quot;.

Day three was given over to discussing the situation in the Diocese of Natal and its controversial bishop John William Colenso &quot;who had been deposed and excommunicated for heresy because of his unorthodox views of the Old Testament.&quot; Longley refused to accept a condemnatory resolution proposed by Hopkins, Presiding Bishop of the Americans, but they later voted to note &#x27;the hurt done to the whole communion by the state of the church in Natal&#x27;. Of the 13 resolutions adopted by the conference, 2 have direct reference to the Natal situation.

Day four saw the formal signing of the address. There had been no plan for further debate but the bishops unexpectedly returned to the subject of Colenso, delaying the end of the conference. Other resolutions have to do with the creation of new sees and missionary jurisdictions, Commendatory Letters, and a voluntary spiritual tribunal in cases of doctrine and the due subordination of synods. It was agreed that the reports of the committees would be received at a final meeting on 10 December by those bishops still in England. On the final day, the bishops attended Holy Communion at Lambeth Parish Church at which Longley presided; Fulford of Montreal, one of the instigators of the original request, preached. No one session of the conference had all the bishops attending although all signed the Address and Longley was authorised to add the names of absent bishops who later subscribed to it. Attending bishops included 18 English, 5 Irish, 6 Scots, 18 American and 24 &quot;Colonial&quot;.

The Latin and Greek texts of the &quot;encyclical&quot; (as it rapidly became known) were produced by Wordsworth of Lincoln.

===Second: 1878===

*Presided over by: Archibald Campbell Tait
*100 bishops present

Tait was a friend of Colenso and shared Dean Stanley&#x27;s Erastian views (that the conference should not have been called without some royal authority) but when the Canadians again requested a Conference in 1872, he concurred. The American bishops suggested a further conference in 1874, Kerfoot of Pittsburgh delivering the request in person. Importantly, the Convocation of the Province of York had changed its position and now supported the Conference idea. 108 of the 173 bishops accepted the invitation, although the actual attendance was a little smaller. The first gathering was in Canterbury Cathedral on St Peter&#x27;s Day, 29 June. The bishops then moved Lambeth for the First Session on 2 July, after Holy Communion at which Tait presided and Thomson of York preached, the bishops gathered in the library. One half day was assigned to each of the six main agenda areas. The reports of the special committees (based in part upon those of the committee of 1867) were embodied in the encyclical letter, which described the best mode of maintaining union, voluntary boards of arbitration, the relationship between missionary bishops and missionaries (a particular problem in India), chaplains in continental Europe, modern forms of infidelity and the best way of dealing with them and the condition, progress and needs of the churches. A final service of thanksgiving took place in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 27 July. Attending bishops included 35 English, 9 Irish, 7 Scots, 19 American and 30 &quot;Colonial and Missionary&quot;. One bishop suffragan and a number of former colonial bishops with commissions in England also attended as full members. The costs of the conference were met by the English bishops and a programme of excursions was organised by the member of Parliament J. G. Talbot. The Latin and Greek texts of the encyclical were again produced by Wordsworth of Lincoln.

===Third: 1888===
*Presided over by: Edward White Benson
*145 bishops present

The agenda of this conference was noticeable for its attention to matters beyond the internal organisation of the Anglican Communion and its attempts to engage with some of the major social issues that the member churches were encountering. In addition to the encyclical letter, nineteen resolutions were put forth, and the reports of twelve special committees are appended upon which they are based, the subjects being intemperance, purity, divorce, polygamy, observance of Sunday, socialism, care of emigrants, mutual relations of dioceses of the Anglican Communion, home reunion, Scandinavian churches, Old Catholics, etc., Eastern Churches, standards of doctrine and worship. Importantly, this was the first conference to make use of the &quot;Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral&quot; as a basis for Anglican self-description. The Quadrilateral laid down a fourfold basis for home reunion: that agreement should be sought concerning the Holy Scriptures, the Apostles&#x27; and Nicene creeds, the two sacraments ordained by Christ himself and the historic episcopate.

===Fourth: 1897===

*Presided over by: Frederick Temple (having been convened by Archbishop Benson)
*194 bishops present

This conference was held a year early because of the thirteenth centennial celebrations of St. Augustine&#x27;s arrival in Kent. The first event was a visit by the bishops to the Augustine monument at Ebbsfleet. A special train was run by the South Eastern Railway that stopped at Canterbury to collect the cathedral clergy and choir. A temporary platform was built at Ebbsfleet for first class passengers; second class passengers had to alight at Minster-in-Thanet and walk the remaining 2.3 miles. After an act of worship the party retrained and proceeded to Richborough to visit the Roman remains and take tea. There is no station at Richborough, perhaps a second temporary one was created. The bishops then travelled back to Canterbury to be ready for the opening service of the conference on the following day. The arrangements did not go well and the Dean of Canterbury complained of &#x27;the appalling mismanagement by the railway authorities&#x27;.

One of the chief subjects for consideration was the creation of a tribunal of reference, but the resolutions on this subject were withdrawn due to opposition of the bishops of the Episcopal Church in the USA, and a more general resolution in favour of a &quot;consultative body&quot; was substituted. The encyclical letter is accompanied by sixty-three resolutions (which include careful provision for provincial organisation and the extension of the title archbishop &quot;to all metropolitans, a thankful recognition of the revival of brotherhoods and sisterhoods, and of the office of deaconess,&quot; and a desire to promote friendly relations with the Eastern Churches and the various Old Catholic bodies), and the reports of the eleven committees are subjoined.

Davidson chafed under the arrangements for the conference in which he had played no part and determined to write the final encyclical himself. There were a number of unfortunate phrases in his draft to which many bishops objected but he refused to accept amendments on the day of its presentation. However, he reconsidered overnight and announced the following morning that he had changed the draft as requested. A bishop who rose to thank to express gratitude for his change of mind was rebuked with the words, &quot;Sir you may thank me all you wish, but you must thank me in silence&quot;.

===Fifth: 1908===

*Presided over by: Randall Davidson
*242 bishops present

The chief subjects of discussion were: the relations of faith and modern thought, the supply and training of the clergy, education, foreign missions, revision and &quot;enrichment&quot; of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the relation of the Church to &quot;ministries of healing&quot; (Christian Science, etc.), the questions of marriage and divorce, organisation of the Anglican Church, and reunion with other Churches. The results of the deliberations were embodied in seventy-eight resolutions, which were appended to the encyclical issued, in the name of the conference, by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 8 August.

===Sixth: 1920===

*Presided over by: Randall Davidson
*252 bishops present
*Rejected Christian Science, spiritualism, and theosophy
*Supported political lobbying against &quot;such incentives to vice as indecent literature, suggestive plays and films, the open or secret sale of contraceptives, and the continued existence of brothels.&quot;
*Affirmed the place of women as lay members of synods.

The single most important action of this conference was to issue the &quot;Appeal to all Christian People&quot;, which set out the basis on which Anglican churches would move towards visible union with churches of other traditions. The document repeated a slightly modified version of the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral and then called on other Christians to accept it as a basis on which to discuss how they may move toward reunion. The proposal did not arise from the formal debates of the conference but amongst a group of bishops talking over tea on the lawn of Lambeth Palace.

The conference&#x27;s uncompromising and unqualified rejection of all forms of artificial contraception, even within marriage, was contained in Resolution 68, which said, in part:

We utter an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers – physical, moral and religious – thereby incurred, and against the evils with which the extension of such use threatens the race. In opposition to the teaching which, under the name of science and religion, encourages married people in the deliberate cultivation of sexual union as an end in itself, we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage. One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists, namely the continuation of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control.

===Seventh: 1930===

*Presided over by: Cosmo Gordon Lang
*308 bishops attended. Lang had been ill prior to the Conference and had to rest the month of June to be in shape to preside over the Conference. Lang said that he weathered the five weeks without &quot;illness&quot; or &quot;undue fatigue&quot;

The conference opened with a &quot;day of devotion&quot; at Fulham Palace, the residence of the Bishop of London. Holy Communion was celebrated at 8:30 am with an address by 86-year-old Edward Talbot, retired Bishop of Winchester.

The conference&#x27;s &quot;manner of deliberations&quot; followed the pattern used in earlier conferences. The six subjects (see the list of subjects in the Resolutions section below) proposed for consideration were brought before sessions of the whole Conference for six days, from July 7 to July 12. The subjects were all referred to committees. The work of the committees was aided by the essays and papers that had been prepared for them in advance. After their two-weeks of deliberations, the committees presented their reports and resolutions to the whole conference from July 28 to August 9.

Seventy-five resolutions passed
The subjects on which resolutions were passed at the Conference are the following:
I. the Christian Doctrine of God
II. the Life and Witness of the Christian Community 
III. the Unity of the Church 
IV. the Anglican Communion
V. the Ministry of the Church
VI. Youth and Its Vocation

Sampling of Resolutions by subject
The Conference adopted seventy-five Resolutions. They can all be seen at Anglican Communion Document Library: 1930 Conference.

I. Christian Doctrine of God: Resolutions 1–8
*Resolution 2 expressed an &quot;urgent need in the face of many erroneous conceptions for a fresh presentation of the Christian doctrine of God&quot;.
*Resolution 3 admonished &quot;Christian people&quot; to banish &quot;from their minds the ideas concerning the character of God which are inconsistent with the character of Jesus Christ.&quot;

II. Life and Witness of the Christian Community
*(1) Marriage and Sex: Resolutions 9-20
**Resolution 11 recommended that &quot;the marriage of one, whose former partner is still living, should not be celebrated according to the rites of the Church,&quot; and when &quot;an innocent person has remarried under civil sanction and desires to receive the Holy Communion,&quot; the case should be referred to the bishop.
**Resolution 15 allowed &quot;in those cases where there is such a clearly felt moral obligation to limit or avoid parenthood, and where there is a morally sound reason for avoiding complete abstinence, the Conference agrees that other methods may be used, provided that this is done in the light of the same Christian principles.&quot; The vote for this Resolution was 193 for it, 67 against it, and 47 not voting. This was the only Resolution for which a record of the numbers voting was required.
**&quot;The Times&quot; of June 30, 1930, predicted that the Lambeth Conference would change the &quot;social and moral life&quot; of humanity. This was done by the Conference&#x27;s Resolution 15 in which in contradiction to earlier Resolutions (1908 Resolution 41 and 1920 Resolution 66) allowed the use of contraception in marriage.
**Walter Carey, Bishop of Bloemfontein, withdrew from the Conference in protest and even sent a petition to King George V on the subject.
**Resolution 16 expressed &quot;abhorrence of the sinful practice of abortion.&quot;
**Resolution 18 reckoned &quot;sexual intercourse between persons who are not legally married&quot; to be &quot;a grievous sin.&quot;
*(2) Race: Resolutions 21–24
**Resolution 22 affirmed the Conference&#x27;s &quot;conviction that all communicants without distinction of race or colour should have access in any church to the Holy Table of the Lord, and that no one should be excluded from worship in any church on account of colour or race.&quot; 
*(3) Peace and War: Resolutions 25–30
**Resolution 25 affirmed that &quot;war as a method of settling international disputes is incompatible with the teaching and example of our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;
**Resolution 26 noted with approval the work of the League of Nations.

III. Unity of the Church: Resolutions 31–47 
&quot;The Conference encouraged the Unity of the Church in all parts of the world.&quot;
It was primarily concerned (1) with the relations of the Churches of the Anglican Communion to the Orthodox Churches of the East, and (2) with the Proposed Scheme of Union in South India, and (3) with the problems arising in Special Areas. Various Churches sent delegations to consult with the Conference, notably the Old Catholics.
*Resolution 31 recorded, &quot;with deep thanks to Almighty God, the signs of a growing movement towards Christian unity in all parts of the world since the issue of the &quot;Appeal to All Christian People&quot; by the Lambeth Conference in 1920 and reaffirmed &quot;the principles contained in it and in the Resolutions dealing with reunion adopted by that Conference.&quot;
*Resolution 47 applied the call for Unity of the Church to the Anglican Communion by calling on its members &quot;to promote the cause of union by fostering and deepening in all possible ways the fellowship of the Anglican Communion itself.&quot;

IV. Anglican Communion: Resolutions 48–60
*Resolution 49 approved a statement of the &quot;nature and status of the Anglican Communion,&quot; namely that &quot;the Anglican Communion is a fellowship, within the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, of those duly constituted dioceses, provinces or regional Churches in communion with the See of Canterbury,&quot; which have three things in common:
**(a) &quot;they uphold and propagate the Catholic and Apostolic faith and order as they are generally set forth in the Book of Common Prayer as authorised in their several Churches&quot;
**(b) &quot;they are particular or national Churches, and, as such, promote within each of their territories a national expression of Christian faith, life and worship&quot;
**(c) they are bound together &quot;by mutual loyalty sustained through the common counsel of the bishops in conference.&quot;
* This Resolution was a Lambeth Conference&#x27;s first attempts at defining the Anglican Communion.
*Resolution 50 reaffirmed Resolution 44 of the Lambeth Conference of 1920, &quot;that the Consultative Body is of the nature of a continuation committee of the Lambeth Conference, and neither possesses nor claims any executive or administrative power&quot; and added further directions for its operation.

V. Ministry of the Church: Resolutions 61–74
*(1) The Ministry of Women: Resolutions 61–72
**Resolution 66 stressed the &quot;great importance of offering to women of ability and education&quot; a role in directing &quot;the work of the Church.&quot;
**Resolution 67 reaffirmed the 1920 Conference that &quot;the order of deaconess is for women the one and only order of the ministry which we can recommend our branch of the Catholic Church to recognise and use.&quot;
**The 1920 Lambeth Conference had acknowledged that the Church had &quot;undervalued and neglected the gifts of women.&quot; Nevertheless, it still held to the &quot;differences between women and men&quot; and said that deaconess was the &quot;only Order of the Ministry&quot; with Apostolic approval. The 1930 Lambeth Conference again rejected any parity of deaconesses with deacons because a deaconess was &quot;outside the historic Orders of the ministry.&quot; 
**Resolution 70 allowed bishops, &quot;on the request of the parish priest&quot; to entrust specific functions to deaconesses, namely, &quot;a. to assist the minister in the preparation of candidates for baptism and for confirmation; b. to assist at the administration of Holy Baptism by virtue of her office; c. to baptize in church, and to officiate at the Churching of Women; d. in church to read Morning and Evening Prayer and the Litany, except such portions as are reserved to the priest, and to lead in prayer; with the license of the bishop, to instruct and preach, except in the service of Holy Communion.&quot; 
*(2) Religious Communities: Resolution 74
**Resolution 74 recognized &quot;the growth of religious communities both of men and women in the Anglican Communion and the contribution which they have made.&quot;

Cost of the Conference
Traditionally the Archbishop of Canterbury bore the cost of a Lambeth Conference. For the 1930 Conference, the British Church Assembly provided £2,000. toward the cost. However, this was only a fraction of the total cost. One item, providing lunch and afternoon tea every day for five weeks, cost £1,400.

===Eighth: 1948===

*Presided over by: Geoffrey Fisher
*349 bishops attend
*Advised that the ordination of Florence Li Tim-Oi &quot;would be against the tradition and order...of the Anglican Communion&quot; and dismissed the need for further examination of women&#x27;s ordination.
*Welcomed full communion between the Anglican and Old Catholic churches.
*Affirmed that &quot;discrimination between men on the grounds of race alone is inconsistent with the principles of Christ&#x27;s religion&quot;.

===Ninth: 1958===

*Presided over by: Geoffrey Fisher
*310 bishops attend
*Called for respect for the &quot;consciences&quot; of married couples who use birth control.
*Recommended considering the renewal of the permanent diaconate.

===Tenth: 1968===

This was the first conference not to take place in Lambeth Palace. This was because of the increase in the number of bishops attending, as well as the presence of almost 100 observers and consultants. Meetings were instead held at Church House, Westminster although the bishops, with their spouses, were invited to dinner at Lambeth by rotation.
* Presided over by Michael Ramsey who famously dozed off during at least one debate.
*462 bishops attended
*Recommended the ordination of women to the diaconate and the recognition of previously appointed &quot;deaconesses&quot; as deacons.
*Found the arguments for and against women in the priesthood &quot;inconclusive&quot;.
*Suggested that assent to the Thirty-Nine Articles no longer be required of clergy.
*Endorsed open communion.

===Eleventh: 1978===

*Presided over by Donald Coggan
*440 bishops attended.
This conference &quot;recognised the autonomy of each of its member churches...legal right of each Church to make its own decision&quot; about women priests. It also denounced the use of capital punishment and called for a common lectionary.

This was the first conference to be held on the campus of the University of Kent at Canterbury where every subsequent conference has been held.

The 1978 Conference included forty assistant bishops.

===Twelfth: 1988===

*Presided over by Robert Runcie
*518 bishops present
The conference dealt with the question of the inter-relations of Anglican international bodies and issues such as marriage and family, human rights, poverty and debt, environment, militarism, justice and peace. Women&#x27;s ordination to the priesthood was also a major topic of discussion. Archbishop Michael Peers, Bishop Graham Leonard, Bishop Samir Kafity, and the Reverend Nan Arrington Peete spoke to the assembly on the topic. Peete, who was ordained in the Episcopal Church USA, was the first female priest to speak at the Lambeth Conference. The conference decided that &quot;each province respect the decision of other provinces in the ordination or consecration of women to the episcopate.&quot;

At previous Lambeth Conferences, only bishops were invited to attend, but all members of the Anglican Consultative Council and representative bishops from the &quot;Churches in Communion&quot; (i.e. the Churches of Bangladesh, North and South India and Pakistan) were invited to attend.

=== Thirteenth: 1998 ===

*Presided over by: George Carey
*749 bishops present including, for the first time, eleven of them women

The most hotly debated issue at this conference was homosexuality in the Anglican Communion. It was finally decided, by a vote of 526–70, to pass a resolution (1.10) calling for a &quot;listening process&quot; but stating (in an amendment passed by a vote of 389–190) that &quot;homosexual practice&quot; (not necessarily orientation) is &quot;incompatible with Scripture&quot; and that the Conference &quot;cannot advise the legitimising or blessing of same sex unions nor ordaining those involved in same gender unions&quot;. A subsequent public apology was issued to gay and lesbian Anglicans in a &quot;Pastoral Statement&quot; from 182 bishops worldwide, including eight primates (those of Brazil, Canada, Central Africa, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales), and an attempt was made at conciliation the following year in the form of the Cambridge Accord. Division and controversy centred on this motion and its application continued to the extent that, ten years later, in 2007, Giles Goddard of Inclusive Church suggested in published correspondence with Andrew Goddard across the liberal–evangelical divide: &quot;It&#x27;s possible to construct a perfectly coherent argument that the last 10 years have been preoccupied with undoing the damage Lambeth 1.10 caused to the Communion.&quot;

A controversial incident occurred during the conference when Bishop Emmanuel Chukwuma of Enugu, Nigeria, attempted to exorcise the &quot;homosexual demons&quot; from Richard Kirker, a British priest and the general secretary of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement, who was passing out leaflets. Chukwuma told Kirker that he was &quot;killing the church&quot;; Kirker&#x27;s civil response to the attempted exorcism was &quot;May God bless you, sir, and deliver you from your prejudice against homosexuality.&quot;

Reflecting on resolution 1.10 in the lead up to Lambeth 2022, Angela Tilby recalled the intervention of Bishop Michael Bourke, who successfully proposed an amendment which said: &quot;We commit ourselves to listen to the experience of homosexual persons&quot;. Tilby considered that while the amendment had appeared inconsequential at the time, it had indeed been significant: she said that the idea of &quot;patient listening&quot; underpinned the Church of England&#x27;s process Living in Love and Faith.

Discussions about a mission to fight poverty, create jobs and transform lives by empowering the poor in developing countries using innovative savings and microcredit programs, business training and spiritual development led to the formation of Five Talents.

===Fourteenth: 2008===
*Presided over by Rowan Williams
*Around 670 bishops present

The fourteenth conference took place from 16 July to 4 August 2008 at the University of Kent&#x27;s Canterbury campus. In March 2006 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, issued a pastoral letter to the 38 primates of the Anglican Communion and moderators of the united churches setting out his thinking for the next Lambeth Conference.

Williams indicated that the emphasis will be on training, &quot;for really effective, truthful and prayerful mission&quot;. He ruled out (for the time being) reopening of the controversial resolution 1.10 on human sexuality from the previous Lambeth Conference, but emphasised the &quot;listening process&quot; in which diverse views and experiences of human sexuality were being collected and collated in accordance with that resolution and said it &quot;will be important to allow time for this to be presented and reflected upon in 2008&quot;.

Williams indicated that the traditional plenary sessions and resolutions would be reduced and that &quot;We shall be looking at a bigger number of more focused groups, some of which may bring bishops and spouses together.&quot;

Attendance at the Lambeth Conference is by invitation of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Invitations were sent to more than 880 bishops around the world for the Fourteenth Conference. Notably absent from the list of those invited are Gene Robinson and Martyn Minns. Robinson was the first Anglican bishop to exercise the office while in an acknowledged same-sex relationship, and Rowan Williams said it was &quot;proving extremely difficult to see under what heading he might be invited to be around&quot;, drawing criticism. Minns, the former rector of Truro Episcopal Church in Fairfax, Virginia, was the head of the Convocation of Anglicans in North America, a splinter group of American Anglicans; the Church of Nigeria considered him a missionary bishop to the United States, despite protest from Canterbury and the U.S. Episcopal Church.

In 2008, four Anglican primates announced that they intended to boycott the Lambeth conference because of their opposition to the actions of Episcopal Church in the USA (the American province of the Anglican Communion) in favour of homosexual clergy and same-sex unions. These primates represent the Anglican provinces of Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda. In addition, Peter Jensen, Archbishop of Sydney, Australia and Michael Nazir-Ali, Bishop of Rochester, among others announced their intentions not to attend.

The Global Anglican Future Conference, a meeting of conservative bishops held in Jerusalem in June 2008 (one month prior to Lambeth), was thought by some to be an &quot;alternative Lambeth&quot; for those who are opposed to the consecration of Robinson. GAFCON involved Martyn Minns, Peter Akinola and other dissenters who considered themselves to be in a state of impaired communion with the American Episcopal Church and the See of Canterbury. The June 2008 church blessing of a civil relationship between Peter Cowell, an Anglican chaplain at the Royal London Hospital and priest at Westminster Abbey, and David Lord, an Anglican priest serving at a parish in Waikato, New Zealand, renewed the debate one month prior to the conference. Martin Dudley, who officiated at the ceremony at St Bartholomew-the-Great, maintained that the ceremony was a &quot;blessing&quot; rather than a matrimonial ceremony.
In 2008, the seven martyred members of the Melanesian Brotherhood were honoured during the concluding Eucharist of the 2008 conference at Canterbury Cathedral. Their names were added to the book of contemporary martyrs and placed, along with an icon, on the altar of the &quot;Chapel of the Saints and Martyrs of Our Times&quot;. When the Eucharist was over, bishops and others came to pray in front of the small altar in the chapel. The icon stands in the cathedral as a reminder of their witness to peace and of the multi-ethnic character of global Anglicanism.

===Fifteenth: 2022===

* Presided over by Justin Welby
* Around 660 bishops present

The ten-year cycle followed since 1948 would have suggested a Lambeth Conference in 2018. Justin Welby had replaced Rowan Williams in 2013, and against a backdrop of disagreement within the Anglican Communion over homosexuality, Welby declined to convene a conference until he had visited primates in their own countries, and felt confident that the vast majority of bishops would attend. Welby appointed a Design Group under the chairmanship of Archbishop Thabo Makoba of Cape Town to plan for a conference in 2020. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference was delayed by two years. With the theme, &quot;God&#x27;s Church to God&#x27;s World&quot;, the conference began on 27 July 2022. It lasted for 12 days with around 660 bishops in attendance.

The conference once again included significant discussion of homosexuality and same-sex marriage, with a draft &#x27;call&#x27; with similarities to Resolution 1.10 from the 1998 conference being included in the conference&#x27;s proceedings (which declared gay sex to be a sin). On 2 August, Welby &#x27;affirmed the validity&#x27; of Resolution 1.10 saying that it was &quot;not in doubt&quot;. This prompted criticism from several LGBTQ+ activists including Jayne Ozanne and Sandi Toksvig, and the signing by 175 bishops and primates of a pro-LGBTQ statement asserting the holiness of the love of all committed same-sex couples.

In response to the discourse surrounding sexuality at the Conference, the University of Kent LGBT+ Staff Network organised an &#x27;inclusion march&#x27; called the Lambeth Walk, which was attended by over 150 people including LGBT+ bishops and their spouses, followed by the &quot;Rainbows in Religion&quot; symposium which included guest speakers Jayne Ozanne and Dr Angus M Slater.

<text>Numerous cases involving Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been heard by Supreme Courts throughout the world. The cases revolve around three main subjects: the practice of their religion, displays of patriotism and military service, and blood transfusions.

The Supreme Courts of many states have established the rights of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and other faiths to engage in the practice of evangelism.

==Armenia==
On July 11, 2011, the Grand Chamber issued a ruling for &quot;Bayatyan v. Armenia&quot;; Armenia was found to violate ECHR Article 9 (right to freedom of religion or belief) in the conviction of Mr. Vahan Bayatyan, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and Armenian national, for draft evasion.

==Canada==
The Supreme Court of Canada has made several important decisions concerning Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. These include laws that affected the activities of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the 1950s and more recent cases dealing with whether Witness parents had the right to decide what medical treatment was in the best interest of their children based on their faith.

On November 15, 1955 (&quot;Chaput v Romain&quot; [1955] S.C.R. 834), a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness member successfully brought action against police officers for disrupting a religious meeting and seizing articles. The entry and the seizure were made without a warrant. No charge was laid against any of the participants including the appellant and the items seized were not returned.

On January 27, 1959 (&quot;Roncarelli v Duplessis&quot; [1959] S.C.R. 121), the Supreme Court of Canada found that Maurice Duplessis, the premier of Quebec, wrongfully caused the revocation of Frank Roncarelli&#x27;s liquor license. Roncarelli, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, was a restaurant owner in Montreal who offered bail security for members of his faith arrested by the Municipality. The Witnesses were frequently arrested for distributing magazines without the necessary permits under a city by-law. The Chief Prosecutor of the city, Oscar Gagnon, overwhelmed by the number of Witnesses being arrested and then released as a result of Roncarelli&#x27;s intervention, contacted the Premier who spoke to Edouard Archambault, Chairman of the Quebec Liquor Commission. Extensive testimony showed the government actors believed Roncarelli was disrupting the court system, causing civil disorder, and was therefore not entitled to the liquor license.

On June 26, 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada issued a 6–1 decision saying courts must take into account the maturity and decision-making capacity of minors before ruling on enforced medical treatment. The case involved a young Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, identified only as A.C., who was admitted to a hospital in Winnipeg with internal bleeding as a complication of Crohn&#x27;s disease. Doctors sought a blood transfusion, but A.C. and her parents refused on religious grounds; child welfare officials moved to take her into care and a court ordered that she be given the transfusion. The judge said he was satisfied she was competent, but since she was under 16 the judge felt that her competence was immaterial to existing law. Justice Rosalie Abella wrote for the majority, &quot;A young person is entitled to a degree of decisional autonomy commensurate with his or her maturity.&quot;

On May 31, 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada issued a 9–0 decision saying courts have no jurisdiction to review membership questions of a religious organization. &quot;In the end, religious groups are free to determine their membership and rules; courts will not intervene in such matters save where it is necessary to resolve an underlying legal dispute,&quot; Justice Malcolm Rowe wrote in the decision.

==France==
On October 5, 2004, the Court of Cassation—the highest court in France for cases outside of administrative law—rejected the Witnesses&#x27; recourse against taxation at 60% of the value of some of their contributions, which the fiscal services assimilated to a legal category of donations close to that of inheritance and subject to the same taxes between non-parents. The court ruled that the tax administration could legally tax the corporation used by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses if they received donations in the form of &quot;dons gratuits&quot; and they were not recognized as &quot;associations cultuelles&quot;.

On June 30, 2011, the European Court of Human Rights found France to be guilty of violation of ECHR Article 9 (religious freedom) in regard to the 60% tax levied on all donations received from 1993 to 1996. The Court found that the tax assessment represented a cut in the association&#x27;s operating resources sufficient to interfere with the free exercise of its members&#x27; religion in practical terms. By 2011, the Government of France sought the Association to pay a sum of 58 million Euros. A representative of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in France stated that &quot;no other major religion in France was subjected to this tax&quot; and that &quot;the Court saw that this was not a legitimate effort to collect revenue, but rather an attempt to use taxation as a means of restricting the worship of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.&quot;

==Germany==
In December 2000, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses did not have to pass a test of &quot;loyalty to the state&quot;.

The Federal Constitutional Court held that transfusing blood to an unconscious Jehovah&#x27;s Witness violated the person&#x27;s will, but did not constitute a battery.

==India==
In 1985, three students of NSS High School at Kidangoor in the Kottayam district of Kerala were expelled for not singing the national anthem of India. The children were from a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness family. Their father, V. J. Emmanuel, approached the Kerala High Court challenging the school&#x27;s decision, arguing that their religion prohibits singing the anthem. The court ruled in favor of the school&#x27;s decision. Subsequently, Emmanuel filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court overturned the High Court&#x27;s decision and backed the appellant, ruling that Jehovah&#x27;s Witness children could not be compelled to sing the national anthem in schools.

==Japan==
In 1998, &quot;The Watchtower&quot; reported that &quot;On March 8, 1996, the Supreme Court of Japan [ruled that] ... Kobe Municipal Industrial Technical College violated the law by expelling Kunihito Kobayashi for his refusal to participate in martial arts training.&quot;

According to &quot;Awake!&quot;, &quot;Misae Takeda, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, was given [a] blood transfusion in 1992, while still under sedation following surgery to remove a malignant tumor of the liver.&quot; On February 29, 2000, &quot;the four judges of the Supreme Court unanimously decided that doctors were at fault because they failed to explain that they might give her a blood transfusion if deemed necessary during the operation, thus depriving her of the right to decide whether to accept the operation or not.&quot;

==Philippines==

In 1993, the Supreme Court of the Philippines held that exemption may be accorded to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses concerning the observance of the flag ceremony out of respect for their religious beliefs.

In 1995 and 1996, the Supreme Court of the Philippines granted an exception to laws regarding marriage to a practicing Jehovah&#x27;s Witness because enforcement of those laws would have inhibited the free exercise of religious beliefs.

==Russia==

After the fall of the communist bloc of nations in Eastern Europe and Asia, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were allowed to worship freely in those nations for the first time since World War II. However, after the 1990s, several court cases in the Moscow courts banned Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the Moscow district. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses won a favorable verdict in the European Court of Human Rights on June 10, 2010, in the case of &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses of Moscow v. Russia&quot;.

On April 20, 2017, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation ruled in favor of a claim from the Ministry of Justice to liquidate the Administrative Center of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Russia. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses won a consequent case in the European Court of Human Rights on June 7, 2022, in the case &quot;Taganrog LRO and Others v. Russia&quot;.

==United States==

In the United States, numerous cases involving Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are now landmark decisions of First Amendment law. In all, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses brought 23 separate First Amendment actions before the U.S. Supreme Court between 1938 and 1946. Supreme Court Justice Harlan Fiske Stone once quipped, &quot;I think the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses ought to have an endowment in view of the aid which they give in solving the legal problems of civil liberties.&quot;

The most important U.S. Supreme Court legal victory won by the Witnesses was in the case &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education vs. Barnette&quot; (1943), in which the court ruled that school children could not be forced to pledge allegiance to or salute the U.S. flag. The &quot;Barnette&quot; decision overturned an earlier case, &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot; (1940), in which the court had held that Witnesses could be forced against their will to pay homage to the flag.

The fighting words doctrine was established by &quot;Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire&quot; (1942). In that case, Walter Chaplinsky, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, had reportedly told a New Hampshire town marshal who was attempting to prevent him from preaching, &quot;You are a God-damned racketeer&quot; and &quot;a damned fascist&quot; and was arrested. Chaplinsky admitted using the words, except for &quot;God&quot;. The court upheld the arrest, thus establishing that &quot;insulting or &#x27;fighting words&#x27;, those that by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace&quot; are among the &quot;well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech [which] the prevention and punishment of...have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem.&quot;

On January 15, 1951, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision of a lower court in convicting two Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses lecturers of disorderly conduct for conducting public speeches in a city park of Harford County in Maryland without permits. The Supreme Court stated that the initial conviction was based on the lack of permits that were unconstitutionally denied, therefore convictions were not able to stand. The initial conviction was declined for review by the Maryland Court of Appeals under its normal appellate power, and further declined to take the case on certiorari, stating that the issues were not &quot;matters of public interest&quot; which made it desirable to review. Chief Justice Fred Vinson delivered the opinion of the Court, stating that &quot;rarely has any case been before this Court which shows so clearly an unwarranted discrimination in a refusal to issue such a license. The City Council indeed held a hearing at which it considered the application. But we have searched the record in vain to discover any valid basis for the refusal.&quot;

On March 9, 1953, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned and remanded the Supreme Court of Rhode Island&#x27;s affirmation of the conviction of a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses member for holding a religious meeting in a city park of Pawtucket. The opinion of the court was that the religious service of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses had been treated differently from the religious services of other denominations. The court stated that the city had not prohibited church services in the park, as Catholics and Protestants could conduct services there without violating the ordinance.

In 2002, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses refused to get government permits to preach door-to-door in Stratton, Ohio. The case was heard in the U.S. Supreme Court (&quot;Watchtower Society v. Village of Stratton&quot; — ). The Court ruled in favor of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, holding that making it a misdemeanor to engage in door-to-door advocacy without first registering with the mayor and receiving a permit violates the First Amendment as it applies to religious proselytizing, anonymous political speech, and the distribution of handbills.

<doc id="157972" wikidata="Q1395000" url="?curid=157972" title="John Colenso">
<text>John William Colenso (24 January 1814 – 20 June 1883) was a Cornish cleric and mathematician, defender of the Zulu and biblical scholar, who served as the first Bishop of Natal. He was a scholar of the Zulu language. In his role as an Anglican theologian, Colenso is now remembered for views of the Bible that set off intense controversy.

==Early life and education==
Colenso was born at St Austell, Cornwall, on 24 January 1814 the son of John William Colenso and Mary Ann Blackmore. His surname is Cornish and possibly originates from Colenso in the parish of St Hilary, near Penzance in West Cornwall. It is a place name from the Cornish language &quot;Kelyn dhu&quot;, meaning &quot;dark hollies&quot;. His father (John William Colenso) invested his capital into a mineral works in Pentewan, Cornwall, but the speculation proved to be ruinous when the investment was lost following a sea flood. His cousin William Colenso was a missionary in New Zealand.

Family financial problems meant that Colenso had to take a job as an usher in a private school before he could attend university. These earnings and a loan of £30 raised by his relatives paid for his first year at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge where he was a sizar. Showing talent in mathematics, in 1836 he was Second Wrangler and Smith&#x27;s Prizeman at the University of Cambridge, and in 1837 he became fellow of St John&#x27;s. Two years later he went to Harrow School as mathematical tutor, but the step proved an unfortunate one. The school was at its lowest ebb, and Colenso not only had few pupils, but lost most of his property in a fire. He returned to Cambridge burdened by an enormous debt of £5,000. However, within a relatively short period he paid off this debt by diligent tutoring and the sale to Longmans of his copyright interest in the highly successful and widely read manuals he had written on algebra (in 1841) and arithmetic (in 1843).

==Career==
Colenso&#x27;s early theological thinking was heavily influenced by F. D. Maurice to whom he was introduced by his wife and by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

In 1846 he became rector of Forncett St Mary, Norfolk, and in 1853 he was recruited by the Bishop of Cape Town, Robert Gray, to be the first Bishop of Natal. He was consecrated as bishop on St Andrew&#x27;s Day, 30 November 1853, at St Mary-at-Lambeth.

===Life in Africa===
Colenso was a significant figure in the history of the published word in 19th-century South Africa. He first wrote a short but vivid account of his initial journeying in Natal, &quot;Ten Weeks in Natal: A Journal of a First Tour of Visitation Among the Colonists and Zulu Kafirs of Natal&quot;. Using the printing press he brought to his missionary station at Ekukhanyeni in Natal, and with William Ngidi he published the first Zulu Grammar and English/Zulu dictionary. His 1859 journey across Zululand to visit Mpande (the then Zulu King) and meet with Cetshwayo (Mpande&#x27;s son and the Zulu King at the time of the Zulu War) was recorded in his book &quot;First Steps of the Zulu Mission&quot;. The same journey was also described in the first book written by native South Africans in Zulu – &quot;Three Native Accounts&quot; by Magema Fuze, Ndiyane and William Ngidi. He also translated the New Testament and other portions of Scripture into Zulu.

===Religious debate===

Through the influence of his talented and well-educated wife, Sarah Frances Bunyon, Colenso became one of only a handful of theologians to embrace Frederick Denison Maurice, who was raised a Unitarian but joined the Church of England to help it &quot;purify and elevate the mind of the nation&quot;. Before his missionary career Colenso&#x27;s volume of sermons dedicated to Maurice signalled the critical approach he would later apply to biblical interpretation and the baleful impact on native Africans of colonial expansion in southern Africa.

Colenso first courted controversy with the publication in 1855 of his &quot;Remarks on the Proper Treatment of Polygamy&quot;, one of the most cogent Christian-based arguments for tolerance of polygamy.

Colenso&#x27;s experiences in Natal informed his development as a religious thinker. In his commentary on St Paul&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to the Romans&quot; (1861), he countered the doctrine of eternal punishment and the contention that Holy Communion was a condition to salvation. He also questioned the presence of a distinctly Christian Church in Rome, stating - &quot;Was there, in fact, any Christian Church at Rome at all, at this time, distinct and definitely marked off from the Jewish community? There would seem to have been none whatever...&quot; Colenso, as a missionary, would not preach that the ancestors of newly Christianised Africans were condemned to eternal damnation.

The thought-provoking questions put to him by students at his missionary station encouraged him to re-examine the contents of the &quot;Pentateuch&quot; and the &quot;Book of Joshua&quot; and question whether certain sections of these books (e.g., Noah&#x27;s Ark, the Deluge, the Crossing of the Red Sea, the Exodus, etc.), should be understood as literally or historically accurate. His conclusions, positive and negative, were published in a series of treatises on the &quot;Pentateuch&quot; and the &quot;Book of Joshua&quot;, from 1862 to 1879. The publication of these volumes created a scandal in England and were the cause of a number of counter-blasts from those (clergy and laity alike) who refused to countenance the possibility of biblical fallibility. Colenso&#x27;s work attracted the notice of biblical scholars on the continent such as Abraham Kuenen and played an important role in the development of Old Testament criticism in Britain; not only in relation to the theological/doctrinal issues of the Bible&#x27;s inerrancy, infallibility, and literalism (rather than allegorism), and not only in relation to its increasingly-demonstrated scientific, historical, geographical, and chronological inaccuracies, and the consequent controversies about the age of the Earth, but, also, in relation to the precise accuracy of the translations-of-the-original presented in particular versions, as well as the separate question of how the Bible itself had developed and which parts (when written, and by whom) of which particular texts (and in what order) should be included in the Bible itself.

Colenso&#x27;s biblical criticism and his high-minded views about the treatment of African natives created a frenzy of alarm and opposition from the High Church party in South Africa and in England. As controversy raged in England, the South African bishops headed by Bishop Robert Gray pronounced Colenso&#x27;s deposition in December 1863. Colenso, who had refused to appear before this tribunal otherwise than by sending a proxy protest (delivered by his friend Wilhelm Bleek), appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. The Privy Council eventually decided that the Bishop of Cape Town had no coercive jurisdiction and no authority to interfere with the Bishop of Natal. In view of this finding of &quot;ultra vires&quot; there was no opinion given upon the allegations of heresy made against Colenso. The first Lambeth Conference was convened in 1867 to address concerns raised by the Privy Council&#x27;s decision in favour of Colenso.

His adversaries, though unable to remove him from his episcopal office, succeeded in restricting his ability to preach both in Natal and in England. Bishop Gray not only excommunicated him but consecrated a rival bishop (William Macrorie), who took the title of &quot;Bishop of Maritzburg&quot; (the latter a common name for Pietermaritzburg). The contributions of the missionary societies were withdrawn, but an attempt to deprive him of his episcopal income and the control of St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral in Pietermaritzburg was frustrated by another court ruling. Colenso, encouraged by a handsome testimonial raised in England to which many clergymen subscribed, returned to his diocese. A rival cathedral was built but it has long been sold and moved. The new Cathedral of the Nativity, beside St Peter&#x27;s, honours both Bishop Colenso and Bishop Macrorie in the names it has given to its halls.

Songs were written by Samuel John Stone as a response to the schism within the Church of South Africa. It inspired him to write a set of hymns titled &quot;Lyra Fidelium; Twelve Hymns on the Twelve Articles of the Apostles&#x27; Creed&quot; (1866). Among them was &quot;The Church&#x27;s One Foundation&quot;.

===Advocacy of native African causes===

Colenso devoted the latter years of his life to further labours as a biblical commentator and as an advocate for native Africans in Natal and Zululand who had been unjustly treated by the colonial regime in Natal. In 1874 he took up the cause of Langalibalele and the Hlubi and Ngwe tribes in representations to the Colonial Secretary, Lord Carnarvon. Langalibalele had been falsely accused of rebellion in 1873 and, following a charade of a trial, was found guilty and imprisoned on Robben Island. In taking the side of Langalibalele against the Colonial regime in Natal and Theophilus Shepstone, the Secretary for Native Affairs, Colenso found himself even further estranged from colonial society in Natal.

Colenso&#x27;s concern about the misleading information that was being provided to the Colonial Secretary in London by Shepstone and the Governor of Natal prompted him to devote much of the final part of his life to championing the cause of the Zulus against Boer oppression and official encroachments. He was a prominent critic of Sir Bartle Frere&#x27;s efforts to depict the Zulu kingdom as a threat to Natal. Following the conclusion of the Anglo-Zulu War he interceded on behalf of Cetshwayo with the British government and succeeded in getting him released from Robben Island and returned to Zululand.

He was known as &#x27;Sobantu&#x27; (father of the people) to the native Africans in Natal and had a close relationship with members of the Zulu royal family; one of whom, Mkhungo (a son of Mpande), was taught at his school in Bishopstowe. After his death his wife and daughters continued his work supporting the Zulu cause and the organisation that eventually became the African National Congress.

===Polygenism===

Colenso was a polygenist; he believed in Co-Adamism, i.e. that races had been created separately. Colenso pointed to monuments and artefacts in Egypt to debunk monogenist beliefs that all races came from the same stock, i.e. from Adam and Eve. Ancient Egyptian representations of races, for example, showed exactly how the races looked today. Egyptological evidence indicated the existence of remarkable permanent differences in the shape of the skull, bodily form, colour and physiognomy between different races. Colenso believed that racial variation between races was so great, that it was impossible that all the races could have come from the same stock just a few thousand years ago. He was unconvinced that the climate could change racial variation. With other biblical polygenists, Colenso believed that monogenists had interpreted the Bible incorrectly.
Colenso said &quot;It seems most probable that the human race, as it now exists, had really sprung from more than one pair.&quot; Colenso denied that polygenism caused any kind of racist attitudes or practices; like many other polygenists, he claimed that monogenesis was the cause of slavery and racism. Colenso claimed that each race had sprung from a different pair of parents, and that all races had been created as equals by God.

==Death==

Colenso died at Durban, South Africa, on 20 June 1883, and was buried in front of the altar in his church, St Peter&#x27;s, Pietermaritzburg. His daughter Frances Colenso (1849–1887) published two books on the relations of the Zulus to the British (&quot;History of the Zulu War and Its Origin&quot; in 1880 and &quot;The Ruin of Zululand&quot; in 1885) that explained recent events in Zululand from a pro-Zulu perspective. His oldest daughter, Harriette Colenso (1847 – 1932), took up Colenso&#x27;s mantle as advocate for the Zulus in opposition to their treatment by the authorities appointed by Natal, especially in the case of Dinizulu in 1888–1889 and in 1908–1909.

==Personal life==
Colenso married Sarah Frances Bunyon in 1846, and they had five children, Harriette Emily, Frances Ellen, Robert John, Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Ernest, and Agnes. (In the marriage register, her name is spelt Bunyan. There had long been variations in the spelling of a surname that goes back at least to the 12th century in England and in Normandy.) Sarah&#x27;s sister Harriette McDougall was a missionary.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1979 film &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;, Colenso is sympathetically portrayed by Freddie Jones, as a principled critic of the decision to declare war on Cetshwayo and the Zulus.

A minor town Colenso in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is named after him.

The Zulu people of his era nicknamed him &#x27;Sobantu&#x27;, a name that translates to father of the people. The township Sobantu in the city of Pietermaritzburg is named after him.

<doc id="157980" wikidata="Q727241" url="?curid=157980" title="Roger of Wendover">
<text>Roger of Wendover (died 6 May 1236), probably a native of Wendover in Buckinghamshire, was an English chronicler of the 13th century.

At an uncertain date he became a monk at St Albans Abbey; afterwards he was appointed prior of the cell of Belvoir, but he forfeited this dignity in the early years of Henry III, having been found guilty of wasting the endowments. His latter years were passed at St Albans, where he died on 6 May 1236.

==Works==
Roger is the first in the series of important chroniclers who worked at St Albans. His best-known chronicle, called the &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; (&quot;Flowers of History&quot;), is based in large part on material which already existed at St Albans. The actual nucleus of the early part of Roger&#x27;s &quot;Flowers of History&quot; is supposed to have been the compilation of John de Cella (also known as John of Wallingford), who was abbot of St Albans from 1195 to 1214, although that is inconclusive.

John&#x27;s work started from the year 1188, and was revised and continued by Roger up to 1235, the year before his death. Roger claims in his preface to have selected &quot;from the books of catholic writers worthy of credit, just as flowers of various colours are gathered from various fields.&quot; Hence he called his work &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;—a title appropriated in the 14th century to a long compilation by various hands. Begun at St Albans based upon the Chronicle of Matthew Paris, it was finally completed at Westminster continuing to the year 1326. The work was long ascribed to one &quot;Matthew of Westminster&quot;, but it is now known that no actual chronicler of that name ever existed.

Roger&#x27;s work, like that of most chroniclers, is, valued not so much for what he culled from previous writers as for its full and lively narrative of contemporary events, from 1216 to 1235, An example being his description of King John&#x27;s troops action in the north during the bitter war at the end of his reign:

The historian W. L. Warren argues that Roger&#x27;s intention was to tell stories which encouraged virtue rather than to record facts: 
The &quot;Revelation of St Nicholas to a monk of Evesham&quot; was composed in 1196 but the author is unknown. In an abridged form, it is found in Roger of Wendover&#x27;s &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; under the year 1196. It is a curious religious allegory, treating the pilgrimage of a soul from death through purgatory and paradise to heaven. The monk, conducted by St Nicholas, is taken from place to place in purgatory, where he meets and converses with persons of various ranks, who relate their stories and their suffering. From purgatory he advances slowly to paradise, and finally reaches the gates of heaven; after which he awakes.

==Publication history==
Roger&#x27;s work is known to us through one thirteenth-century manuscript in the Bodleian Library (Douce manuscript 207), a mutilated 14th-century copy in the British Library (Cotton manuscript Otho B. v.), and the edition prepared by Matthew Paris which forms the first part of that writer&#x27;s &quot;Chronica Majora&quot;. The best edition of Roger&#x27;s works is that of H. O. Coxe (four volumes, London, 1841–44); there is another (covering the material from 1154) in the Rolls Series by H. G. Hewlett (three volumes, 1886–89). Roger wrote on the Order of Assassins claiming they were situated in Tyre &quot;in Phoenicia, around the bishopric of Antardus&quot;. It is presumed he got this information from travellers visiting St Albans or people returning from pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

<doc id="157987" wikidata="Q780970" url="?curid=157987" title="Thurstan">
<text>:&quot;This page is about Thurstan of Bayeux (1070 – 1140) who became Archbishop of York. Thurstan of Caen became the first Norman Abbot of Glastonbury in circa 1077.&quot;

Thurstan or Turstin of Bayeux ( – 6 February 1140) was a medieval Archbishop of York, the son of a priest. He served kings William II and Henry I of England before his election to the see of York in 1114. Once elected, his consecration was delayed for five years while he fought attempts by the Archbishop of Canterbury to assert primacy over York. Eventually, he was consecrated by the pope instead and allowed to return to England. While archbishop, he secured two new suffragan bishops for his province. When Henry I died, Thurstan supported Henry&#x27;s nephew Stephen of Blois as king. Thurstan also defended the northern part of England from invasion by the Scots, taking a leading part in organising the English forces at the Battle of the Standard (1138). Shortly before his death, Thurstan resigned from his see and took the habit of a Cluniac monk.

==Early life==

Thurstan was the son of a canon of St Paul&#x27;s in London named Anger, Auger or Ansgar, who held the prebend of Cantlers. Another son of Anger, Audoen, was later Bishop of Évreux. Thurstan&#x27;s mother was named Popelina. Thurstan was born sometime about 1070 in Bayeux, in the Bessin region of Normandy. Before 1104 the father was given the prebend of Cantlers by Maurice, Bishop of London, and the family moved to England.

Early in his career, Thurstan held the prebendary of Consumpta per mare in the diocese of London, and served both William Rufus and Henry I as a royal clerk. At some point in Thurstan&#x27;s early career, he visited Cluny, where he vowed to become a Cluniac monk later in his life. Thurstan also served Henry as almoner, and it was Henry who obtained Thurstan&#x27;s election as Archbishop of York in August 1114. He was ordained a deacon in December 1114 and ordained a priest on 6 June 1115 by Ranulf Flambard, who was Bishop of Durham.

==Controversy and exile==
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Ralph d&#x27;Escures, refused to consecrate Thurstan unless the archbishop-elect made a profession of obedience to the southern see. This was part of the long-running Canterbury-York dispute, which started in 1070. Thurstan refused to make such a profession, and asked the king for permission to go to Rome to consult Pope Paschal II. Henry I refused to allow him to make the journey, but even without a personal appeal from Thurstan, Paschal decided against Canterbury. At the Council of Salisbury in 1116 the English king ordered Thurstan to submit to Canterbury, but instead Thurstan publicly resigned the archbishopric. On his way to the council, Thurstan had received letters from Paschal II that supported York and commanded that he should be consecrated without a profession. Similar letters had gone to Ralph d&#x27;Escures from the pope, ordering Ralph, as Archbishop of Canterbury, to consecrate Thurstan. After the news of the letters became public, Thurstan&#x27;s resignation was ignored, and he continued to be considered the archbishop-elect.

Over the next three years, the new popes, Gelasius II and Calixtus II, championed Thurstan&#x27;s case, and on 19 October 1119 he was consecrated by Calixtus at Reims. Calixtus had earlier promised Henry that he would not consecrate Thurstan without the king&#x27;s permission, which had still not been granted. Enraged at this, the king refused to allow the newly consecrated archbishop to enter England, and Thurstan remained for some time on the continent in the company of the pope. While he was travelling with the pope, he also visited Adela of Blois, King Henry&#x27;s sister, who was also Thurstan&#x27;s spiritual daughter. At about this same time, Calixtus issued two bulls in Thurstan&#x27;s favor: one released York from Canterbury&#x27;s supremacy forever, and the other demanded the king allow Thurstan to return to York. The pope threatened an interdict on England as a punishment if the papal bull was not obeyed. At length, Thurstan&#x27;s friends, including Adela, succeeded in reconciling him with Henry, and he rejoined the king in Normandy. At Easter 1120, he escorted Adela to the monastery of Marcigny, where she retired from active secular affairs. He was recalled to England in early 1121.

==Archbishop==

One of the main weaknesses of the see of York was its lack of suffragan bishops. Thurstan managed to secure the resurrection of the Diocese of Galloway, or Whithorn, in 1125. It is possible that he compromised with Fergus of Galloway, who was the lord or sub-king of Galloway, in what is now Scotland. In this Thurstan secured another suffragan, and Fergus gained a bishop in his lordship, where previously ecclesiastical matters in his subkingdom had been handled by Scottish bishops. The first bishop was the native Galwegian – Gilla Aldan. This provoked the wrath of Wimund, Bishop of the Isles, who had previously had jurisdiction over Galloway; but the new bishopric survived, and York had a new suffragan, an important step in the battle between York and Canterbury over the primacy, which was mainly a battle over the prestige of their respective sees. The number of bishops subject to either archbishop was an important factor in the reputation of each. In 1133, Thurstan, who had received papal permission to found an entirely new diocese, consecrated Æthelwold as the first bishop of the new see of Carlisle.

Thurstan refused to accept that the new Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, was his superior, and did not help with William&#x27;s consecration. The dispute between the two continued, and both archbishops carried their complaints in person to Rome twice. In 1126, Pope Honorius II ruled in favour of York. The pope based his decision on the fact that Canterbury&#x27;s supporting documents had been forged.

Thurstan supported King Stephen after Henry I&#x27;s death in 1135, and appeared at Stephen&#x27;s first court at Easter held at Westminster. Thurstan negotiated a truce at Roxburgh in 1138 between England and Scotland. It was Thurstan who mustered the army which defeated the Scots at the Battle of the Standard on 22 August 1138 near Northallerton, Yorkshire. Thurstan did not take direct part in the battle., but he created the standard that gave the battle its name, by putting a ship&#x27;s mast in a cart and hanging the banners of Saint Peter of York, Saint John of Beverley, and Saint Wilfrid of Ripon on the mast. The Scots had invaded, attempting to aid the Empress Matilda, the daughter of Henry I and Stephen&#x27;s rival for the throne. On 21 January 1140 Thurstan resigned his see and entered the order of the Cluniacs at Pontefract and he died there on 6 February 1140. He was buried in the church at Pontefract.

==Saint==

In 2024 evidence emerged that Thurstan had been acclaimed as a saint: his name was found, associated with a feast day of 6 February, in an ancient catalogue of saints&#x27; days at Pontefract Priory. At the time the pope&#x27;s approval was not needed for sainthood; the monks at Pontefract exhumed his body two years after his death and, finding it well-preserved, acclaimed him as a saint. This detail was lost in the destruction of monasteries&#x27; possessions during the Reformation.

==Legacy==

Thurstan gave land to many of the churches of his diocese and founded several religious houses. He founded the first nunnery in Yorkshire when he founded St Clement&#x27;s between 1125 and 1133. He obtained for Whitby Abbey a papal privilege of protection as well as giving his privilege to the abbey. He also helped found the Cistercian Abbey of Fountains, by giving the site to monks who had been expelled from the Abbey of St. Mary&#x27;s, York. Thurstan helped the hermitess Christina of Markyate at several points in her career, and tried to persuade her to become the first prioress of his foundation of St. Clement&#x27;s. He was a patron to the Augustinian Hexham Priory, founded by his predecessor at York, as well as helping the foundation of Bridlington Priory, another Augustinian house. He was a sincere reformer and opposed to the election of unfit men to the episcopacy. When Pope Innocent II asked Thurstan&#x27;s opinion on the elevation of Anselm of St Saba, who was Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds, to become Bishop of London, Thurstan replied, &quot;If we consider his life and reputation, it would be much more fitting to remove him from his abbacy than to promote him to be bishop of London.&quot; Anselm was not confirmed as bishop.

Thurstan is described by the historian Edmund King as &quot;a bishop like no other. Thurstan and the baronage of Yorkshire had been partners in a common enterprise, their security in this world and their salvation in the next, and to all aspects of his role he had shown a complete commitment.&quot; His death occurred during The Anarchy of the civil war between Stephen and Matilda and led to a breakdown in order.

Thurstan&#x27;s nephew was Osbert de Bayeux, who became an archdeacon at York, and in 1154 was accused of the murder of William of York, one of Thurstan&#x27;s successors at York.

<doc id="157991" wikidata="Q1337529" url="?curid=157991" title="Ranulf Flambard">
<text>Ranulf Flambard ( 1060 – 5 September 1128) was a medieval Norman Bishop of Durham and an influential government official of King William Rufus of England. Ranulf was the son of a priest of Bayeux, Normandy, and his nickname Flambard means incendiary or torch-bearer, and may have referred to his personality. He started his career under King William I of England, probably in the compilation of the Domesday Book of 1086, as well as being the keeper of the king&#x27;s seal. On the death of William I, Ranulf chose to serve the new king of England, William Rufus.

Under Rufus, Ranulf continued to hold the king&#x27;s seal, and also became involved in the financial administration of the kingdom, where he quickly made a name for himself by his novel methods of raising revenue. He was given custody of a number of vacant ecclesiastical offices, administering at one point sixteen vacant bishoprics or abbeys. His many duties have led to him being considered the first Chief Justiciar of England. During Rufus&#x27;s reign, Ranulf supervised the construction of the first stone bridge in London and oversaw the construction of the king&#x27;s hall at Westminster. In 1099 he was rewarded with the bishopric of Durham.

On the death of Rufus in 1100, Ranulf was imprisoned in the Tower of London by Rufus&#x27; successor Henry I of England. Ranulf was a convenient scapegoat for the financial extortions of Rufus&#x27;s reign. He became the first prisoner to escape from the Tower and went into exile in Normandy with Rufus&#x27;s and Henry&#x27;s older brother Robert Curthose, the Duke of Normandy. Ranulf became a leading advisor to Robert, and assisted in his unsuccessful invasion of England, an attempt to oust Henry from the throne. The brothers reconciled, but although Ranulf was restored to office he spent the next few years in Normandy, returning only after Henry had defeated Robert at the Battle of Tinchebray. Ranulf subsequently retired from political life, with only occasional appearances in public. He remained active in ecclesiastical affairs, attending councils and working to defend the rights of his see.

==Early life==

Ranulf was a Norman and the son of Thurstin, a parish priest in the diocese of Bayeux. Ranulf was probably born about 1060, as he was close to 70 when he died in 1128. Originally he worked for Odo of Bayeux, but he soon entered the chancery of King William I, Odo&#x27;s half-brother. He stood out amongst the other clerks for his intelligence and his good looks. His nickname, Flambard, means torch-bearer, incendiary or devouring flame; and may have been given to him for his high-spirited personality. Orderic Vitalis, a medieval chronicler, records that Robert fitzThurstin gave the nickname to Ranulf, because Robert resented the fact that Ranulf, though of low birth, ordered the nobility around. Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury told the pope that the nickname came from Ranulf&#x27;s cruelty, which Anselm likened to a consuming flame. Orderic went on to claim that Ranulf was &quot;educated from boyhood with base parasites among the hangers-on of the court&quot;.

Ranulf acquired the reputation of an able financier and administrator and helped to increase the royal revenues. He appears to have played an important part in the compilation of the Domesday survey, perhaps even the main orchestrator of the project. Domesday Book gives his profession as a clerk and records him holding land in a number of counties. Before the death of the old king he became chaplain to Maurice, Bishop of London, whom he had formerly served in the chancery. Some sources call him &quot;almost illiterate&quot;, but this probably meant he was not formally educated in the liberal arts. His work in the chancery and as an administrator would have required knowledge of Latin. He also served as the keeper of the king&#x27;s seal from about 1085. Once, while he was travelling in the Thames estuary with the seal, he was captured by pirates. He prevented the capture of the seal by throwing it into the sea. Although he served William the Conqueror, he does not attest a single genuine charter or writ of William&#x27;s, which implies he was not a leading servant. When King William died and his lands were split between his elder son Robert Curthose, who received Normandy, and the third son, William Rufus, who received England, Ranulf chose to serve Rufus in England.

==Work under Rufus==

Before the death of William the Conqueror, Ranulf held a prebend in the diocese of Salisbury. Early in the reign of Rufus he held the offices of dean of Christchurch in Twynham, Hampshire and was a prebendary of London and Lincoln. He was still keeper of the king&#x27;s seal, and also may have been in charge of the royal &quot;scriptorium&quot;. He is usually described as the chaplain of Rufus, but he is also called treasurer and sometimes &quot;capitalis justicaiarius&quot;. Other times his role is given the title &quot;procurator&quot;. William of Malmesbury calls him the &quot;manager of the whole kingdom&quot;.

At Christchurch, Ranulf reduced the number of canons serving the church from 25 to 13 by not replacing clerks who died. Ranulf kept the revenues that would have gone to the missing canons and used them to rebuild the church. Some medieval sources claim that in rebuilding the church at Twynham, he not only demolished the church he was replacing but nine others that were nearby.

As chief financial administrator, Ranulf bore the brunt of the chronicler&#x27;s condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the rate of taxation, Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094, when the fyrd, or English militia, was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king&#x27;s brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled, instead of sending them to Normandy, Ranulf dismissed them, after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits, including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm&#x27;s consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief, much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord, from the under-tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester in 1095, when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop, setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated, however.

Ranulf administered for the king a large proportion of the vacant ecclesiastical offices. He personally managed sixteen abbeys or bishoprics. Eventually he obtained the wealthy see of Durham for himself in May 1099, being consecrated on 5 June 1099. He had been the custodian of the see since the death of the previous bishop in early 1096. At his consecration, he managed to avoid giving a profession of obedience to Thomas the Archbishop of York, just as his predecessor had done. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, accused Ranulf of paying 1,000 pounds for the bishopric. He was given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Carlisle and Cumbria because his predecessors had done so as bishops of Lindisfarne, but he only exercised this for a short time, as after the accession of Henry I jurisdiction over these areas was transferred to the diocese of York.

It has been suggested that Ranulf may have been the first Justiciar of all England (or chief justiciar), although he never held the title and it is not clear if his power was as extensive as Roger of Salisbury in the following reign. He ran the government of England while Rufus was fighting in Normandy, not only raising money, but issuing writs and judging court cases. William of Malmesbury, in describing Ranulf&#x27;s financial efforts, said that he &quot;skinned the rich, ground the down the poor, and swept other men&#x27;s inheritances into his net.&quot; Orderic said that Ranulf planned to revise the survey of England, almost certainly Domesday Book, and that he planned to use that revised survey to confiscate all excess holdings over a certain amount. If this was really planned, it was never carried out.

Ranulf often worked in concert with Haimo the &quot;dapifer&quot;, or seneschal, and Urse d&#x27;Abetot in carrying out royal judgements. On one occasion, they, along with Robert Bloet the Bishop of Lincoln, reassessed the lands of Thorney Abbey for taxes. On another occasion, they were ordered along with Ralph de Luffa Bishop of Chichester to see that the abbey of Fecamp received custody of a church at Steyning. Others who often worked with Ranulf were Robert FitzHaimo, Roger Bigod, and Eudo the &quot;dapifer&quot;. These men are sometimes considered by historians to be the first Barons of the Exchequer. There are also signs during Ranulf&#x27;s administration of resident justices in the counties who held courts for the king. Itinerant justices were probably also used to hear pleas that were reserved to the crown.

While administering England for Rufus, Ranulf also supervised construction projects. Under his management, the first stone bridge in London was constructed. Ranulf also built a wall around the White Tower in London, enclosing the inner ward. A new hall at Westminster was also built, of which the outside walls of Westminster Hall are still surviving. He started building the church at Christchurch at Twynham, which he had been granted by Rufus. After Rufus&#x27; death, the church was confiscated from Ranulf, and building work ceased. The crypts and transepts of the current church, however, date from Ranulf&#x27;s construction work.

==Under Henry I==

At the succession of King Henry I, the new king imprisoned Ranulf in the Tower of London on 15 August 1100 on charges of embezzlement. His custodian, William de Mandeville, allowed the bishop to escape on 3 February 1101. Flambard was not only the first inmate at the castle, but also the first person to escape from it. According to Orderic, friends smuggled to Ranulf a rope in a flagon of wine, he gave the drink to his guards, and after they were drunk and asleep, climbed down the rope to escape. His friends had arranged a ship to transport Ranulf, some of the bishop&#x27;s treasure, and the bishop&#x27;s elderly mother to Normandy. He took refuge across the English Channel with Henry&#x27;s brother Robert Curthose, where he became one of the duke&#x27;s principal advisors. King Henry dispossessed Ranulf of his lands at Whitsun in 1101, and the new Archbishop of York Gerard deposed him from his bishopric. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm arranged for Flambard&#x27;s trial in a papal court for simony, and a papal decree was issued against Ranulf.

As Robert&#x27;s advisor, Ranulf pressed the duke to dispute Henry&#x27;s claim to the crown of England. The historian David Crouch says that Ranulf &quot;had to provide the strategic vision and energy that Duke Robert lacked&quot;, and other historians have agreed that Ranulf&#x27;s arrival was the catalyst to Curthose&#x27;s ability to mount an invasion. Ranulf was in charge of organising transport for the duke&#x27;s invasion of England, and also secured the defection of some of Henry&#x27;s ships, thus allowing the fleet to land safely. Robert invaded England in July 1101 along with Ranulf, but Robert agreed at the Treaty of Alton on 2 August 1101 to renounce his claim to the English throne. Although no chronicler mentions Ranulf being present at Alton, he probably was there. Ranulf was pardoned in the treaty and restored to his bishopric, but he chose to stay with Robert for five more years. Some historians, including C. W. Hollister, see the treaty as mainly Ranulf&#x27;s work, as mainly an attempt to salvage his ecclesiastical career in England, along with a displacement of Ranulf from being the chief councillor of Curthose to merely being one of many.

Robert rewarded Ranulf for his advice during the invasion by entrusting him with the administration of the see of Lisieux. After Robert&#x27;s defeat by Henry at Tinchebray in 1106, the bishop was among the first to make his peace with Henry, and returned to Durham. He retired from political life. Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury an able financier who was infinitely more acceptable to the nation. Although some historians have theorised that Ranulf&#x27;s time in Normandy was as an agent of Henry, it appears that Ranulf was mainly looking out for his own interests and those of his family.

In 1108, Ranulf was dragged into the middle of the ongoing dispute between Archbishop Anselm and the newly appointed Archbishop of York, Thomas over whether or not Thomas should profess obedience to Anselm. Because Anselm refused to consecrate Thomas without a profession, and Thomas refused to profess, Thomas was unable to consecrate bishops himself. Ranulf wrote to Anselm, asking that he might act as Thomas&#x27; surrogate and consecrate Thurgot as Bishop of St Andrew&#x27;s. In September 1108, Anselm wrote to Ranulf forbidding anyone but Thomas or Anselm himself to consecrate Thurgot or any other bishops. Later, Ranulf tried to bribe King Henry to take Thomas&#x27; side. Thurgot had been prior of the cathedral chapter at Durham, but had disagreed with Ranulf, who arranged for him to be elected to St Andrew&#x27;s as a solution to the quarrel.

It was Ranulf who ordained Thurstan, the archbishop-elect of York, as a priest in 1115, although Thurstan had to wait for consecration as bishop for another four years. Ranulf attended the Council of Reims in 1119 held by Pope Callixtus II. In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate to England, visited Durham to investigate charges against the bishop. Medieval chroniclers told the story that the legate was much taken with Ranulf&#x27;s niece, and after sleeping with the girl, took no action on the charges against Ranulf. The story is unlikely to be true.

==Death and legacy==

Ranulf worked to complete the cathedral which his predecessor, William de St-Calais, had begun; fortified Durham with a wall around Durham Castle, built Norham Castle to help defend the Tweed River; and endowed the collegiate church of Christchurch, Hampshire. He built or expanded other churches, including the one at Christchurch in Hampshire which he had endowed, and St. Martin&#x27;s in Dover. The first stone bridge at Durham was completed by his instruction in 1120, the so-called Framwellgate Bridge, a bridge described as &quot;of wonderful workmanship.&quot; He cleared and levelled the Palace Green in Durham between the castle and the cathedral. While the chroniclers mainly condemned Ranulf for his morals, his own cathedral chapter held him in high esteem because of his building activities and his defence of the rights of Durham. Although he usurped some of the income of the cathedral chapter, the money from those rights was used to complete the cathedral rebuilding, and later restored the income to the monks as well as increasing the endowment. At his death, the cathedral walls were complete up to &quot;the covering&quot;, which probably means the vault instead of the roof.

Ranulf attracted scholars to his household and reformed the administration of the diocese by dividing it into archdeaconries. Ranulf oversaw the translation of Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s relics to a new tomb in a lavish ceremony. He was also a patron to the hermit Saint Godric, whom he befriended.

One of Ranulf&#x27;s brothers was Fulcher, who was Bishop of Lisieux in 1101. Another brother was Osbern, who was a royal clerk for Rufus, and the last brother was Geoffrey. Fulcher may have been appointed bishop to enable Ranulf to exploit the see while Ranulf was in exile in Normandy. Ranulf had a son, Thomas of Lisieux, who also held the see of Lisieux, right after his uncle. Like his uncle, he may have been appointed as a placeholder to allow his father to appropriate the revenues of Lisieux. Ranulf&#x27;s mistress was an Englishwoman named Alveva or Ælfgifu, who was the mother of at least two of his sons. Alveva&#x27;s sons were Ranulf, who was an archdeacon, and Elias. When Ranulf became bishop, he married her to a burgess of Huntingdon, but remained on good terms with both Alveva and her spouse, often staying with them when he travelled away from Durham. Alveva was the aunt of Christina of Markyate, and Christina is said to have rebuffed the bishop&#x27;s attempts to seduce her in 1114. Alveva and Ranulf&#x27;s son Elias held a prebend at London and was a royal clerk under Henry I. Ranulf&#x27;s son Ralf was parson of Middleham and held a prebend at London too. He was a member of Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury&#x27;s household after 1138. Some of Ranulf&#x27;s sons were educated at Laon under William de Corbeil, who was one of Ranulf&#x27;s clerks. One of Ranulf&#x27;s nephews, Ralf, was archdeacon of Northumberland and during the reign of King Stephen helped to hold the diocese of Durham loyal to Stephen. Other nephews were Osbert, who was sheriff of Durham, and Robert, Richard, and William who held fiefs. Unrelated to Ranulf, William of Corbeil became one of Ranulf&#x27;s household clerks and was eventually elected Archbishop of Canterbury in 1123.

Ranulf died on 5 September 1128. He was buried in his chapter house in Durham, where his tomb was opened in 1874. His skeleton is still extant, and examination of it reveals that he would have been about tall. He was fond of clothes and was always richly dressed. While he was efficient in collecting the royal revenues, he was generous to his own men and, later in life, gave liberally to the poor. His crozier and signet ring were found in his grave, and they were rather plain. An oddity of his grave was that he was buried on top of a layer of charcoal that was laid over alternating layers of lime and dirt.

Ranulf&#x27;s reputation has suffered because of the hostility of the monastic chroniclers to both himself and to Rufus. Many chroniclers decried his financial ruthlessness and his lax morals. Orderic described Ranulf&#x27;s career as &quot;addicted to feasts and carousals and lusts; cruel and ambitious, prodigal to his own adherents, but rapacious in seizing the goods of other men&quot;. Besides the chroniclers, Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury wrote to Pope Paschal II, while Ranulf was in exile, describing Ranulf as &quot;a rent collector of the worst possible reputation.&quot; William of Malmesbury said that Flambard was a &quot;plunderer of the rich, destroyer of the poor&quot;. Victorian historians, including E. A. Freeman, vilified Ranulf, and Freeman especially held that Ranulf was a &quot;malignant genius&quot;. Modern historians have embraced a more moderate view, starting with Richard Southern in 1933. The historian David Bates felt that he, along with his successor Roger of Salisbury, &quot;were essentially the chief managers of the king&#x27;s finance and justice&quot;.

<text>Roger of Salisbury (died 1139), was a Norman medieval bishop of Salisbury and the seventh Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper of England.

==Life==
Roger was originally priest of a small chapel near Caen in Normandy. He was called &quot;Roger, priest of the church of Avranches&quot;, in his notification of election to the bishopric. The future King Henry I, who happened to hear mass there one day, was impressed by the speed with which Roger read the service and enrolled him in his own service.

According to William of Newburgh, Roger was poor and uneducated, but this is considered unlikely by the historian B. R. Kemp. On coming to the throne, Henry almost immediately made him Chancellor in 1101. He held that office until late 1102. On 29 September 1102 Roger received the bishopric of Salisbury at Old Sarum Cathedral, but he was not consecrated until 11 August 1107 owing to the dispute between Henry and him. He was consecrated at Canterbury. During the dispute between Henry and Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, he skillfully managed to keep the favour of both. Roger devoted himself to administrative business, and remodelled it completely. He created the exchequer system, which was managed by him and his family for more than a century, and he used his position to heap up power and riches. He became the first man in England after the King, and was in office, if not in title, justiciar. He was never called Justiciar during Henry&#x27;s reign.

In 1106 Henry defeated and captured his elder brother, Robert Curthose, at the Battle of Tinchebrai, and then handed Robert into Roger&#x27;s custody. In the first two decades of Henry&#x27;s reign, Roger played a major role in governing England when the king was abroad, and after 1120 he was chief minister and regent between 1123 and 1126. In 1123 he helped to secure the see of Canterbury for his nominee, William de Corbeil.

Though Roger had sworn allegiance to Matilda, he disliked the Angevin connection, and went over to Stephen, carrying with him the royal treasure and administrative system upon Stephen&#x27;s accession in 1135. Stephen placed great reliance on him, on his nephews, the bishops of Ely and Lincoln, and on his son Roger le Poer, who was treasurer.

The king declared that if Roger demanded half of the kingdom he should have it, but chafed against the overwhelming influence of the official clique whom Roger represented. Roger had built Devizes Castle, described by Henry of Huntingdon as &quot;the most splendid castle in Europe&quot;. He and his nephews seem to have secured a number of castles outside their own dioceses, and the old bishop behaved as if he were an equal of the King. At a council held in June 1139, Stephen found a pretext for demanding a surrender of their castles, and on their refusal they were arrested. After a short struggle all Roger&#x27;s great castles were sequestrated. However, Henry of Winchester demanded the restoration of the bishop.

The king was considered to have committed an almost unpardonable crime in offering violence to members of the church, in defiance of the scriptural command, &quot;Touch not mine anointed&quot;. Stephen took up a defiant attitude, and the question remained unsettled. This quarrel with the church, which immediately preceded the landing of the Empress, had a serious effect on Stephen&#x27;s fortunes. The moment that the fortune of war turned against him, the clergy acknowledged Matilda. Bishop Roger, however, did not live to see the resolution of these troubles; he died on 11 December 1139. He was a great bureaucrat, and a builder whose taste was in advance of his age. However, his contemporaries were probably justified in regarding him as the type of the bishop immersed in worldly affairs, ambitious, avaricious, unfettered by any high standard of personal morality.

Roger had a nephew Alexander (d. 1148), who became bishop of Lincoln in 1123. Other nephews included Adelelm, archdeacon of Dorset and later dean of the diocese of Lincoln, and Nigel of Ely, bishop of Ely. Roger&#x27;s son Roger le Poer was Lord Chancellor for King Stephen.

<text>William de St-Calais (died 2 January 1096) was a medieval Norman monk, abbot of the abbey of Saint-Vincent in Le Mans in Maine, who was nominated by King William I of England as Bishop of Durham in 1080. During his term as bishop, St-Calais replaced the canons of his cathedral chapter with monks, and began the construction of Durham Cathedral. In addition to his ecclesiastical duties, he served as a commissioner for the Domesday Book of 1086. He was also a councillor and advisor to both King William I and his son, King William II, known as William Rufus. Following William Rufus&#x27; accession to the throne in 1087, St-Calais is considered by scholars to have been the new king&#x27;s chief advisor.

When the king&#x27;s uncle, Odo of Bayeux, raised a rebellion against the king in 1088, St-Calais was implicated in the revolt. William Rufus laid siege to St-Calais in the bishop&#x27;s stronghold of Durham, and later put him on trial for treason. A contemporary record of this trial, the &quot;De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi&quot;, is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial. Imprisoned briefly, St-Calais was allowed to go into exile after his castle at Durham was surrendered to the king. He went to Normandy, where he became a leading advisor to Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, the elder brother of William Rufus. By 1091, St-Calais had returned to England and regained royal favour.

In England, St-Calais once more became a leading advisor to the king. In 1093 he negotiated with Anselm, Abbot of Bec, concerning Anselm&#x27;s becoming Archbishop of Canterbury; in 1095 it was St-Calais who prosecuted the royal case against Anselm after he had become archbishop. During his bishopric, St-Calais stocked the cathedral library with books, especially canon law texts. He was also active in defending the north of England against Scots raids. Before his death, he had made his peace with Anselm, who blessed and consoled St-Calais on his deathbed.

==Early life==
St-Calais was a Norman, and a native of Bayeux; he may have been a member of one of its clerical dynasties. His mother&#x27;s name, Ascelina or Anselma, is given in Durham&#x27;s records; his father, whose name is unknown, became a monk at the monastery of Saint-Calais in Maine, and may previously have been a knight. Although St-Calais is generally referred to as Saint Calais or St-Calais, the main source of information about his life, the monastic chronicle of Symeon of Durham, does not call him such.

St-Calais studied under Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, the half-brother of the future William I of England, who was then Duke of Normandy. Other bishops educated at Bayeux around this time included Archbishop Thomas of York and Samson, Bishop of Worcester. Symeon of Durham considered St-Calais to be well-educated in classical literature and the scriptures; at some point St-Calais also acquired a knowledge of canon law. He became a Benedictine monk at Saint-Calais in Maine, where his father had become a monk, and soon became the prior of that house. He became abbot of St Vincent-des-Prés near Le Mans in Maine, sometime around 1078. As abbot, his only appearance in historical records is his upholding of the monasteries&#x27; right to some property, and his acceptance of a gift of property in the town.

William the Conqueror nominated him to the see of Durham on 9 November 1080, and he was duly consecrated on either 27 December 1080 or 3 January 1081. His elevation may have been a reward for diplomatic services he rendered to the king in France, or to help secure the see from further disorder following the death of the previous bishop, Walcher, during a feud. However, it was most likely in recognition of his administrative ability. Symeon of Durham stated that St-Calais was chosen as a bishop for this reason, describing him as &quot;very well versed in sacred and secular learning, very conscientious in matters of divine and worldly business, and so remarkable for good conduct that he had no equal amongst his contemporaries&quot;.

==Early ecclesiastical affairs==
The chronicler Symeon of Durham asserted that when St-Calais was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Thomas of York, he managed to avoid professing obedience to the archbishop, which, if true, would have freed St-Calais from interference in his diocese. After his appointment, St-Calais decided to replace his cathedral chapter of secular clergy with monks, and consulted the king and Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, before going to Rome to receive permission from Pope Gregory VII. These consultations, and the conditions within his diocese, may have kept St-Calais from visiting Durham until some time after his elevation. In 1083 he expelled the married clergy from the cathedral, and moved a small community of monks from Bede&#x27;s old monastery at Jarrow to Durham, to form the new chapter. This community had been founded at Jarrow by Reinfrid, a Norman ex-knight and monk of Evesham Abbey, and Eadwine, an English monk from Winchcombe Abbey. After the community had settled in Durham, St-Calais named Eadwine as prior, and arranged for lands to be set aside to support the monks. The expelled clergy were offered the option of joining the new monastic house, but only one actually joined.

St-Calais enjoyed good relations with his cathedral chapter, and they supported him when construction began on a new church in 1093. After demolishing an Anglo-Saxon church, he and Prior Turgot of Durham laid the foundation stone on 11 August 1093 for what would later become Durham Cathedral.

St-Calais also gave a set of constitutions to the cathedral chapter, modeled on Lanfranc&#x27;s rule for Canterbury. Symeon of Durham said that the bishop acted towards the monks of his chapter as a &quot;loving father&quot;, and that the monks fully returned the sentiment. St-Calais is said to have researched exhaustively the pre-Norman Conquest customs of the cathedral, before re-establishing monks in the cathedral. He imposed the &quot;Monastic Constitutions&quot; of Lanfranc on the community, instead of the older &quot;Regularis Concordia&quot;.

==Work for William the Conqueror==
During William the Conqueror&#x27;s reign, St-Calais was a frequent witness on charters. While it is often difficult to determine who was considered most important on a charter&#x27;s witness list, placement near the top of the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror&#x27;s reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.

The king sent St-Calais on diplomatic missions to the French royal court and to Rome. After the king&#x27;s imprisonment of Odo of Bayeux, Pope Gregory VII complained to him. The pope was also concerned about the king&#x27;s refusal to allow the delivery of papal letters to the English bishops unless royal permission was secured. To placate the pope, the king dispatched St-Calais to Rome, possibly with Lanfranc, to explain to the pope the reasons for imprisoning Odo. St-Calais also served as a commissioner in the south-western part of England for the Domesday Book, which aimed to survey the whole of England and record who owned the lands. Some historians, including David Bates, have argued that St-Calais was the driving force behind the organization of the entire Domesday survey, although other candidates have been put forward, including Samson, Bishop of Worcester, before he became bishop. Pierre Chaplais, who argues for St-Calais being the main organizer of the survey, argues the bishop&#x27;s exile in 1088 interrupted work on the &quot;Little Domesday Book&quot;, a subproject of the survey which was left uncompleted.

==Rebellion==

Soon after the accession of William Rufus, St-Calais became one of the king&#x27;s most trusted lieutenants, along with the recently released Odo of Bayeux. Later chroniclers often referred to the position that St-Calais held as justiciar, although the formal office did not yet exist. Around Easter 1088, Odo of Bayeux and many of the nobles revolted against the king and tried to place the king&#x27;s elder brother Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, on the throne. After the king had set off with St-Calais and some troops to counter Odo in Kent, St-Calais suddenly deserted, shutting himself in Durham Castle. Why St-Calais joined the rebellion, or at least did nothing to aid the king, is unclear. He and Odo had never been close, and despite the fact that St-Calais was educated at Bayeux, there is no evidence that Odo helped St-Calais&#x27; career. Some historians, including W. M. Aird, have suggested that St-Calais felt the division of the Conqueror&#x27;s realm between two sons was unwise. It has been suggested that St Calais joined the rebellion to reunite the Normans and English under one ruler.

St-Calais was the only bishop who did not actively aid the king; the rebelling magnates included Roger de Montgomery Earl of Shrewsbury, Robert de Mowbray Earl of Northumbria, and Odo&#x27;s brother Robert Count of Mortain. The rebellion had failed by the end of the summer, but St-Calais continued to hold out in Durham, at first claiming he had never actually rebelled. When the king&#x27;s army arrived, St-Calais agreed to come out, but only after receiving a safe conduct that would allow him to attend a trial while his men continued to hold the castle. St-Calais&#x27;s actions suggest that he did rebel, whatever his claims to the contrary and affirmations of his innocence in northern chronicles.

==Trial==
St-Calais was brought before the king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, before which the king seized his lands. At the trial, St-Calais held that as a bishop he could not be tried in a secular court, and refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc presented the king&#x27;s case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then asked for an appeal to Rome, which was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or lands, was forfeit. Although St-Calais claimed to be defending the rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to appeal to Rome, his fellow bishops believed otherwise. Lending support to their belief is the fact that St-Calais never pursued his appeal to Rome, and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the king against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm tried to assert a right to appeal to Rome.

During the course of the trial, Lanfranc is said to have stated that the court was &quot;trying you not in your capacity as bishop, but in regard to your fief; and in this way we judged the bishop of Bayeux in regard to his fief before the present king&#x27;s father, and that king did not summon him to that plea as bishop but as brother and earl.&quot; Unlike the later case of Thomas Becket, St-Calais received little sympathy from his fellow bishops. Most of the bishops and barons that judged the case seem to have felt that the appeal to Rome was made to avoid having to answer an accusation that St-Calais knew was true. The final judgement was only reached after the king lost his temper and exclaimed: &quot;Believe me, bishop, you&#x27;re not going back to Durham, and your men aren&#x27;t going to stay at Durham, and you&#x27;re not going to go free, until you release the castle.&quot; The extant &quot;De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi&quot;, or &quot;Of the Unjust Persecution of the Bishop William I&quot;, details the trial of St-Calais before the king. This work is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial; some have doubted its authenticity, however, claiming St-Calais would not have been as knowledgeable in canon law as the work portrays him. The historian Mark Philpott argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of the canon law, the &quot;False Decretals&quot;, which still survives.

==Return to favour==
After the court adjourned, St-Calais was held as a prisoner at Wilton Abbey until his followers in Durham relinquished the castle. Once the castle was back under the king&#x27;s control, St-Calais was released, and exiled; he left for Normandy, and no more was heard of his appeal to Rome. Pope Urban II did write to the king in 1089 requesting that St-Calais be restored to his see, but nothing came of it. In Normandy, St-Calais quickly became one of Duke Robert&#x27;s principal advisors and his chief administrator. On 14 November 1091 he regained the favour of William Rufus, and was restored to his see. Duke Robert had persuaded the king to allow Bishop William&#x27;s return, perhaps in recognition of a service St-Calais performed for the king by brokering the end of a siege in Normandy that the king&#x27;s forces were about to lose. The end of the siege prevented the loss of the castle.

St-Calais returned to Durham on 11 September 1091, with a large sum of money and gifts for his church. Thereafter he remained in the king&#x27;s favour. In fact, in 1093 his lands were restored without the need to perform feudal services. For the rest of his life, St-Calais remained a frequent advisor to the king. It was St-Calais, along with Robert, Count of Meulan who negotiated with Anselm, the abbot of Bec, in 1093 over the conditions under which Anselm would allow himself to be elected Archbishop of Canterbury.

St-Calais managed the king&#x27;s case against Anselm at Rockingham in 1095, when Anselm wished to go to receive his pallium from Pope Urban II. At that time St-Calais opposed Anselm&#x27;s attempt to appeal to Rome over the issue, and steadfastly maintained the king&#x27;s position against Anselm, even advocating that the archbishop be deprived of his lands and sent into exile. Later, when the king was negotiating with Walter of Albano, the papal legate sent by Urban to convey the pallium to Anselm and to secure the king&#x27;s recognition of Urban as pope, St-Calais was the king&#x27;s chief negotiator. The clerical reformers, Eadmer among them, who supported Anselm in these quarrels, later tried to claim that St-Calais had supported the king out of a desire to succeed Anselm as archbishop if Anselm was deposed, but it is unlikely that St-Calais seriously believed that Anselm would be deposed. St-Calais secured grants from the king in return for his services. His efforts on behalf of the king earned him hostile accounts in Eadmer&#x27;s later writings.

==Diocesan affairs==
Durham&#x27;s location in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England on a number of occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm&#x27;s sons, who had been educated in England, in their attempts to secure the Scottish throne.

Later, in 1095, an English noble, Robert de Mowbray, who was Earl of Northumbria, challenged the bishop&#x27;s authority in the north. When Mowbray rebelled again in 1095, St-Calais helped the king put down the rebellion, and Mowbray was captured. The death of Malcolm and the capture of Mowbray did much to make the north more secure.

In St-Calais&#x27; time as bishop, a long-running dispute began between the monks of the cathedral chapter and successive bishops. This arose because St-Calais did not make a formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop&#x27;s household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to the monks before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case. These forged charters date from the second half of the 12th century.

St-Calais also ordered the destruction of the old cathedral that had been built by Aldhun, to make way for the construction of a new, larger cathedral, the current Romanesque-style Durham Cathedral. The construction of the new cathedral began on 29 July 1093, when St-Calais led his cathedral chapter in dedicating the site. The first stones were laid shortly afterwards, on 11 August 1093. However, St-Calais&#x27; exile after his trial as well as his employment in the royal service meant that he was often absent from his bishopric, and this probably is the cause of the medieval chronicler Symeon of Durham&#x27;s comparatively neutral treatment of St-Calais in his works. There is no evidence of St-Calais performing any of the normal episcopal functions, including consecrating priests or churches.

Probably dating from St-Calais&#x27; time is the confraternity relationship between the monks of Durham and the monks of the monastery of Saint-Calais in Maine. The cult of Saint Calais appears to have been confined to the region around the monastery which the saint had founded. St-Calais appears to have been a devotee of the cult, and the most likely date for the creation of the confraternity link between the two houses is during St-Calais&#x27; time as bishop.

==Death and legacy==

Shortly before Christmas 1095, one of St-Calais&#x27; knights, Boso, fell ill and dreamed he was transported to the afterlife, where he found a large house with gates made of iron. Suddenly, St-Calais emerged from the gates, asking the knight the whereabouts of one of his servants. Boso&#x27;s guide in the dream then informed Boso that this was a warning that St-Calais would soon die. Boso recovered and warned St-Calais of the dream.

St-Calais died on 2 January 1096 after falling gravely ill on the previous Christmas Day. Before his death he was consoled by Anselm and was blessed by his former opponent. He was buried on 16 January 1096 in the chapter house at Durham. The king had summoned St-Calais shortly before Christmas to answer an unknown charge, and it is possible that the stress of this threat caused his death. In 1796 St-Calais&#x27; grave was supposedly found during the demolition of the chapter house at Durham Cathedral. Found in the grave were a pair of sandals, which still survive, and fragments of a gold embroidered robe.

While in office as bishop, St-Calais gave a copy of the &quot;False Decretals&quot; to his cathedral library. The manuscript was an edition that had been collected or prepared by Lanfranc for the use of the chapter of Canterbury. St-Calais may have used this copy in his trial. His plea for an appeal to Rome was grounded in the &quot;False Decretals&quot;, whether or not it was based on this particular manuscript. The manuscript itself is now in the Peterhouse Library. St-Calais also gave a copy of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; to his cathedral chapter; this copy still survives. Other works that St-Calais gave to the cathedral library were copies of Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;De Civitae Dei&quot; and &quot;Confessions&quot;; Gregory the Great&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral Care&quot;, &quot;Moralia&quot;, and &quot;Homilies&quot;; and Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;De Poenitentia&quot;.

St-Calais was known to his contemporaries as an intelligent and able man. He had an excellent memory. Frank Barlow, a historian, describes him as a &quot;good scholar and a monk of blameless life&quot;. Besides his copy of the &quot;Decretals&quot;, he left at his death over fifty books to the monks of Durham, and the list of those volumes still exists. His best-known legacy is the construction of Durham Cathedral, although the nave was not finished until 1130. The construction technique of combining a pointed arch with another rib allowed a six-pointed vault, which enabled the building to attain a greater height than earlier churches. This permitted larger clerestory windows, and let more light into the building. The technique of the six-pointed vault spread to Saint-Etienne in Caen from which it influenced the development of early Gothic architecture near Paris. The system of rib vaulting in the choir was the earliest use of that technique in Europe. The historian Frank Barlow called the cathedral &quot;one of the architectural jewels of western Christendom&quot;.

<text>Isabel Angelica Allende Llona (; born 2 August 1942) is a Chilean-American writer. Allende, whose works sometimes contain aspects of the magical realism genre, is known for novels such as &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; (&quot;La casa de los espíritus&quot;, 1982) and &quot;City of the Beasts&quot; (&quot;La ciudad de las bestias&quot;, 2002), which have been commercially successful. Allende has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s most widely read Spanish-language author.&quot; In 2004, Allende was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and in 2010, she received Chile&#x27;s National Literature Prize. President Barack Obama awarded her the 2014 Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Allende&#x27;s novels are often based upon her personal experience and historical events and pay homage to the lives of women, while weaving together elements of myth and realism. She has lectured and toured U.S. colleges to teach literature. Fluent in English, Allende was granted United States citizenship in 1993, having lived in California since 1989.

== Early life==
Allende was born in Lima, Peru, in 1942, the daughter of Francisca Llona Barros called &quot;Doña Panchita&quot; (the daughter of Agustín Llona Cuevas and Isabel Barros Moreira, of Portuguese descent) and Tomás Allende, who was at the time a second secretary at the Chilean embassy. Her father Tomás was a first cousin of Salvador Allende, President of Chile from 1970 to 1973.

In 1945, after Tomás left them, Isabel&#x27;s mother relocated with her three children to Santiago, Chile, where they lived until 1953. In 1953 Allende&#x27;s mother married Ramón Huidobro and the family moved often. Huidobro was a diplomat appointed to Bolivia and Beirut. In La Paz, Bolivia, Allende attended an American private school; and in Beirut, Lebanon, she attended an English private school. The family returned to Chile in 1958, where Allende was also briefly home-schooled. In her youth, she read widely, particularly the works of William Shakespeare.

In 1970, Salvador Allende appointed Huidobro as ambassador to Argentina.

==Career==
Before writing books, Allende worked with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Santiago, then in Brussels, and elsewhere in Europe from 1959 to 1965. For a short time in Chile, she also had a job translating romance novels from English to Spanish. However, she was fired for making unauthorized changes to the dialogue of the heroines to make them sound more intelligent, as well as altering the Cinderella ending to allow the heroines to find more independence and do good in the world.

=== Exile in Venezuela ===
In 1973, Salvador Allende was overthrown in a coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. Isabel found herself arranging safe passage for people on the &quot;wanted lists&quot;, which she continued to do until her mother and stepfather narrowly escaped assassination. When she herself was added to the list and began receiving death threats, she fled to Venezuela, where she stayed for 13 years. It was during this time that Allende wrote her debut novel &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; (1982). Allende has stated that her move from Chile made her a serious writer: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I would be a writer if I had stayed in Chile. I would be trapped in the chores, in the family, in the person that people expected me to be.&quot; Allende believed that, being female in a patriarchal family, she was not expected to be a &quot;liberated&quot; person. Her history of oppression and liberation is thematically found in much of her fiction, where women contest the ideals of patriarchal leaders. In Venezuela she was a columnist for &quot;El Nacional&quot;, a major national newspaper.

===Journalism===

Beginning in 1967, Allende was on the editorial staff of &quot;Paula&quot; magazine and the children&#x27;s magazine Mampato from 1969 to 1974, where she later became the editor. She published two children&#x27;s stories, &quot;La Abuela Panchita&quot; and &quot;Lauchas y Lauchones&quot;, as well as a collection of articles, &quot;Civilice a Su Troglodita&quot;. She also worked in Chilean television production for channels 7 and 13 from 1970 to 1974. As a journalist, she once sought an interview with poet Pablo Neruda. Neruda agreed to the interview, and he told her that she had too much imagination to be a journalist and should be a novelist instead. He also advised her to compile her satirical columns in book form. She did so, and this became her first published book. In 1973, Allende&#x27;s play &quot;El Embajador&quot; played in Santiago a few months before she was forced to flee the country due to the coup.

During her time in Venezuela, Allende was a freelance journalist for &quot;El Nacional&quot; in Caracas from 1976 to 1983 and an administrator of the Marrocco School in Caracas from 1979 to 1983.

===Author===
In 1977, while in Caracas, Allende received a phone call informing her that her 99-year-old grandfather was near death, and she sat down to write him a letter, hoping to thereby &quot;keep him alive, at least in spirit.&quot; The letter evolved into a book, &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; (1982); this work intended to exorcise the ghosts of the Pinochet dictatorship. The book was rejected by numerous Latin American publishers, but eventually published in Buenos Aires. The book soon ran to more than two dozen editions in Spanish and was translated into a score of languages. Allende was compared to Gabriel García Márquez as an author in the style known as magical realism.

Although Allende is often cited as a practitioner of magical realism, her works also display elements of post-Boom literature. Allende also holds to a very strict writing routine. She writes on a computer, working Monday to Saturday, 09:00 to 19:00. &quot;I always start on 8 January&quot;, Allende stated, &quot;a tradition she began in 1981 with the letter she wrote to her dying grandfather that would become &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot;.&quot;

Allende&#x27;s book &quot;Paula&quot; (1995) is a memoir of her childhood in Santiago and the years she spent in exile. It is written as an anguished letter to her daughter. In 1991 an error in Paula&#x27;s medication resulted in severe brain damage, leaving her in a persistent vegetative state. Allende spent months at Paula&#x27;s bedside before learning that a hospital mishap had caused the brain damage. Allende had Paula moved to a hospital in California where she died on 6 December 1992.

Allende&#x27;s novels have been translated into more than 42 languages and sold more than 77 million copies. Her 2008 book, &quot;The Sum of Our Days&quot;, is a memoir. It focuses on her life with her family, which includes her grown son, Nicolás; second husband, William Gordon; and several grandchildren. A novel set in New Orleans, &quot;Island Beneath the Sea&quot;, was published in 2010. In 2011 came &quot;El cuaderno de Maya&quot; (&quot;Maya&#x27;s Notebook&quot;), in which the setting alternates between Berkeley, California, and Chiloé in Chile, as well as Las Vegas, Nevada.

== Reception ==
&quot;Latino Leaders Magazine&quot; called her a &quot;literary legend&quot; in a 2007 article naming her the third most influential Latino leader in the world.

Her work has drawn some negative criticism. In an article published in &quot;Entre paréntesis&quot;, Roberto Bolaño called Allende&#x27;s literature anemic, comparing it to &quot;a person on his deathbed&quot;, and later called her &quot;a writing machine, not a writer&quot;. Literary critic Harold Bloom said that Allende only &quot;reflects a determinate period, and that afterwards everybody will have forgotten her&quot;. Novelist Gonzalo Contreras said that &quot;she commits a grave error, to confuse commercial success with literary quality&quot;.

Allende told &quot;El Clarín&quot; that she recognizes she has not always received good reviews in Chile, stating that Chilean intellectuals &quot;detest&quot; her. However, she disagrees with these assessments:

It has been said that &quot;Allende&#x27;s impact on Latin American and world literature cannot be overestimated.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Allende &quot;a genius&quot;, and she has received many international awards, including the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize, granted to writers &quot;who have contributed to the beauty of the world&quot;.

==Celebrity==
In 2006, she was one of the eight flag bearers at the Opening Ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. She presented the talk &quot;Tales of Passion&quot; at TED 2007. In 2008, Allende received the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters from San Francisco State University for her &quot;distinguished contributions as a literary artist and humanitarian.&quot; In 2014, Allende received the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from Harvard University for her contributions to literature.

==Politics==
Although not as openly political as some of her contemporary writers, she expressed contempt for Donald Trump and his policies following his election in 2016, and she later endorsed Democrat Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election. She has also regularly defended the record of her father&#x27;s cousin, Salvador Allende.

== Foundation ==
Allende started the Isabel Allende Foundation on 9 December 1996, in honor of her daughter, Paula Frías Allende, who fell into a coma after complications of the disease porphyria led to her hospitalization. Paula was 29 years old when she died in 1992. The foundation is &quot;dedicated to supporting programs that promote and preserve the fundamental rights of women and children to be empowered and protected.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 2019, she married for the third time, to Roger Cukras, a lawyer from New York.

Allende had finished her secondary studies while living in Chile, when she met engineering student Miguel Frías whom she married in 1962. They had two children, a son and a daughter.

Reportedly, &quot;Allende married early, into an Anglophile family and a kind of double life: at home she was the obedient wife and mother of two; in public she became, after a spell translating Barbara Cartland, a moderately well-known TV personality, a dramatist and a journalist on a feminist magazine.&quot;

Allende&#x27;s and Frías&#x27;s daughter Paula was born in 1963; she died in 1992 age 29. In 1966, Allende again returned to Chile, where her son Nicolás was born that year.

In 1978, she began a temporary separation from Miguel Frías. She lived in Spain for two months, then returned to her marriage. She divorced her first husband, Miguel Frías, in 1987. 

During a visit to California on a book tour in 1988, Allende met her second husband, California attorney and novelist William C. &quot;Willie&quot; Gordon. They married in July 1988. In 1994, she was awarded the Gabriela Mistral Order of Merit, the first woman to receive this honor. Allende resides in San Rafael, California. Most of her family lives nearby, with her son, his second wife, and her grandchildren just down the hill, in the house she and her second husband vacated. She separated from Gordon in April 2015.

<text>Symeon (or Simeon) of Durham (died after 1129) was an English chronicler and a monk of Durham Priory.

==Biography==
Symeon entered the Benedictine monastery at Jarrow as a youth. It moved to Durham in 1074, and he was professed in 1085 or 1086.
When William of Saint-Calais returned from his Norman exile in 1091, Symeon was probably in his company. Symeon eventually became precentor of the priory, and examples of his handwriting appear to survive in several Durham books, including the &quot;Liber Vitae&quot;, the so-called Cantor&#x27;s Book (whose text he would have had to keep up to date as part of his duties as precentor), and in copies of his own historical works.

==Works==
Symeon was author of two historical works which are particularly valuable for northern affairs, the &quot;Libellus de Exordio atque Procursu istius, hoc est Dunelmensis, Ecclesie&quot; (&quot;The Little Book on the Origins and Progress of this Church, that is of Durham&quot;) and a historical compilation &quot;Historia regum Anglorum et Dacorum&quot;. The &quot;Libellus de Exordio&quot;, a history of the community of Durham (originally settled at Lindisfarne) from its inception to the year 1096, is by far his most important work. Composed between 1104 and 1107, Symeon&#x27;s task (imposed on him by his monastic superiors) was to demonstrate the continuity of Durham&#x27;s history despite the notable disruptions the community weathered during the Viking invasions and even more recently in the Norman Conquest. Symeon sought furthermore to justify William of Saint-Calais&#x27;s expulsion of Durham&#x27;s clerical community in 1083, in order to replace it with a group of Benedictine monks drawn from Wearmouth and Jarrow. Like earlier Durham writers, Symeon finds historical continuity between the major phases of the community&#x27;s development in the constant presence of their patron, Saint Cuthbert. The miracles worked in Cuthbert&#x27;s name during the late Anglo-Saxon period were particularly flamboyant, and the &quot;Libellus&quot; contains engaging accounts of some of these, including the miracle of the three waves (when Cuthbert turned a portion of the Irish Sea into blood in order to prevent his followers from taking his relics out of England, see &quot;Libellus&quot; ii.11), the foundation of Durham (when Cuthbert&#x27;s body, being moved across England on a cart, refused to be moved, signalling his desire to remain at Durham, see &quot;Libellus&quot; iii.1), and several picturesque deaths visited upon the enemies of Cuthbert&#x27;s devotees.

Several versions of the &quot;Libellus&quot; survive from the Middle Ages. Symeon&#x27;s own revised copy can be found in Durham, University Library, Cosin V.II.6. It is this text which has been most often published. The Durham manuscript also contains two anonymous continuations of Symeon&#x27;s work. The first carries the history from 1096 to the death of Ranulf Flambard (1129); the second extends from 1133 to 1144. A Cambridge manuscript (Cambridge University Library, Ff. i.27) contains a third continuation covering the years 1145-1154. Another manuscript (London, British Library, Cotton Faustina A.V) seems to represent the text of the &quot;Libellus&quot; before the revisions found in the Durham manuscript. A full list of manuscripts can be found on the &quot;Libellus de Exordio&quot; page.

About 1129 Symeon undertook to write a &quot;Historia regum Anglorum et Dacorum&quot;. This begins at the point where the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; of Bede ends. Up to 957 Simeon merely copies some old Durham annals, not otherwise preserved, which are of value for northern history; from that point to 1119 he copies John of Worcester with certain interpolations. The section dealing with the years 1119-1129 is, however, an independent and practically contemporaneous narrative. Symeon writes, for his time, with ease and perspicuity; but his chief merit is that of a diligent collector and copyist.

Symeon also wrote brief biographies of the archbishops of York and a letter on the errors of Origen. Other writings have been attributed to his pen, but on no good authority. They are printed in the &quot;Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores Decem&quot; of Roger Twysden (1652). The most complete modern edition is that of Thomas Arnold (Rolls series, 2 vols., 1882–1885). For the &quot;Libellus&quot;, now see Rollason&#x27;s 2000 edition.

The value of the &quot;Old Northumbrian Annals&quot;, which Symeon used for the &quot;Historia regum&quot;, has been discussed by John Hodgson-Hinde in the preface to his &quot;Symeonis Dunelmensis opera&quot;, vol. i. pp. xiv. ff. (1868); by R. Pauli in &quot;Forschungen zur deutschen Geschichte&quot;, xii. pp. 137 sqq. (Göttingen, 1872); and by William Stubbs in the introduction to Roger of Hoveden, vol. i. p. x. (“Rolls” series).

<text>Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave (, 21 September 176129 November 1793) was a French politician, and, together with Honoré Mirabeau, one of the most influential orators of the early part of the French Revolution. He is most notable for correspondence with Marie Antoinette in an attempt to set up a constitutional monarchy and for being one of the founding members of the Feuillants.

==Early life==
Antoine Barnave was born on 21 September 1761 in Grenoble (Dauphiné), in a Protestant family. His father was an advocate at the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Grenoble, and his mother, Marie-Louise de Pré de Seigle de Presle, was a highly educated aristocrat. Because they were Protestants, Antoine could not attend local schools, as those were run by the Catholic church, and his mother educated him herself. Barnave was prepared for a career in law, and at the age of twenty-two made himself known by a speech pronounced before the local &quot;Parlement&quot;, the &quot;Parlement du Dauphiné&quot;, also known as &quot;Parlement de Grenoble&quot;, on the separation of political powers.

Dauphiné was one of the first of the provinces of France to be touched by revolutionary ideals. After being heavily influenced by the Day of the Tiles () in Grenoble, Barnave became actively revolutionary. He explained his political position in a pamphlet entitled &quot;Esprit des édits, Enregistrés militairement, le 20 mai 1788&quot;. He was immediately elected deputy, with his father, to the Estates General of Dauphiné, and played a prominent role in their debates.

==Estates-General and Assemblies==
A few months later he became better known, when the Estates-General of 1789 convened in Versailles on 5 May 1789, and Barnave was elected a deputy of the Third Estate for his native province of Dauphiné.

He soon rose to prominence in the National Assembly, becoming the friend of most of the leaders of the party originating in the Third Estate, and formed with Adrien Duport and Alexandre Lameth the group known during the Constituent Assembly as &quot;the triumvirate&quot;. Together these three would later be principal figures in the formation of the &quot;Feuillants&quot;, the breakaway party from the Jacobin Club dedicated to a moderate course supporting constitutional monarchy. Barnave took part in the conference on the claims of the three orders, drew up the first address to king Louis XVI, and supported the proposal of Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès that the Assembly should declare itself &quot;National&quot;. Until 1791, he was one of the preeminent members of the club known later as the Jacobin Club, of which he drew up the manifesto and first rulebook.

==Political views==

Although a partisan of political freedom, Barnave hoped to preserve revolutionary liberties together while maintaining the ruling House of Bourbon. He felt that a constitutional monarchy would solve the problems facing France without being a complete upheaval of the government, although it does not mean that he was entirely in favor of the monarchy. Subject to the more radical forces, Barnave took part in the attacks on the monarchy, on the clergy, on Roman Catholic Church property, and on the provincial &quot;Parlements&quot;. On several occasions, he stood in opposition to Mirabeau. After the storming of the Bastille, he saw the power of the masses as possibly leading to political chaos, and wished to avoid this by saving the throne. He advocated the suspensory veto, and the establishment of trial by jury in civil causes, but voted with the Left against the system of two chambers.

His conflict with Mirabeau on the question of assigning to the king the right to make peace or war (from 16 to 23 May 1790) was one of the main episodes of the Assembly&#x27;s mandate. In August 1790, after a vehement debate, he fought a duel with Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazalès, in which the latter was slightly wounded. About the close of October 1790, Barnave was called to the presidency of the Assembly. On the occasion of the death of Mirabeau, which occurred on 2 April 1791, Barnave paid a high tribute to his worth and public services, designating him the &quot;William Shakespeare of oratory&quot;.

Being in favor of a new system of government, Barnave spoke passionately about terminating the powerful influence of religious authorities and allocating that role in government to the people of France. Passing the Civil Constitution of the Clergy would lawfully impose Church adherence to the King and the nation of France by having the state pay them salaries for their service and holding popular elections for the priests and bishops. He strongly supported that government influence remain limited to the people and the King, not a single entity.

Barnave also advocated in favor of freedom of speech and the protection of private property. His vies were in accord with those the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, all citizens were entitled to the purchase and ownership of &#x27;immovables&#x27; that were not to be taken away or trespassed unless it were deened necessary. He said individuals had to possess the liberty to express what they feel and believe in, arguing that the voice of the French people was not to be silenced. The independent quality of ownership of land or business would encourage financial, political, and societal progress.

==Ideas for economic advancement==

===Decree of Lands===

To Barnave, allocating the appropriated land of the Church among the French people would help abate the economic burden and starvation in the country. Having land put up as collateral enables France to receive loans from foreign nations. The land would also become a source of food for the hungry through harvests. This encourages a system of production and sale to stimulate the economy. Barnave saw that the Church, being first estate, had great power and wealth. To him, the roles of the clergy, priests, and bishops resided on spreading the message of God and thus should not oppose providing His children with basic proprietary rights. He stood with the Decree on Church Lands which provided each clergymen with no more than an annual income of 1200 livres while retaining ownership of his residency and lawn. He believed that laborers working this land would strengthen the role of France in the manufacturing sector and revitalize the quality and quantity of agricultural goods.

===End of feudalism and taxation on the nobility===

In 1789, Barnave was one of the key figures to advise King Louis XVI to work in unison with the National Assembly in order to prevent riots that seek an anarchic form of government. He argued that the revolution had sparked a necessary change in politics. The Constitutional monarchy was a way to maintain an improved version of French tradition. However, the nobility&#x27;s special privileges provided by the Feudal system were to be fully terminated. People of higher class had to adhere to the same laws and regulations as did any common citizen, so taxation would be equally applicable to them. Noblemen especially would contribute to tax revenue that will ameliorate France&#x27;s national debt. Barnave was strongly in favor of making France into a country that allowed people unrestricted economic or entrepreneurial practices, enabling all citizens to take part in the offerings of commercial markets.

===Slaves in Saint-Domingue===
Barnave argued that successful political changes, incorporation of equal rights, and an inclusive government stem from successful financial progression. Without a sound economic state, France would not be able to compete with foreign powers, and the people would not have the opportunity to improve their lives or truly live freely. Slavery in Saint-Domingue allowed the cultivation and sale of coffee and sugar to thrive. He opposed discrimination against any race but also understood how the African slaves contributed to the only source of wealth France had at a moment of deep financial crisis. He advocated that abolishing slavery was not an economically smart course of action.

==From violence to compromise==

After the Storming of the Bastille, Barnave argued that violence led the citizens of France to their desired goals – the start of the Revolution and constitutional change. It was now time for people, despite their factions and distinct beliefs, to compromise and unite. Barnave advised the members of the National Assembly of the King&#x27;s role in achieving this. King Louis XVI would enable the new Constitution of France to pass smoothly, and cease the bloodshed by working alongside the people of France. The economy was too weak to sustain the costs of military action against foreign or domestic rivals.
When Louis XVI and the royal family were arrested after the Flight to Varennes, Barnave was one of the three appointed to bring them back to Paris, together with Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve and Charles César de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg. During the journey, he began to feel compassion for queen Marie Antoinette and the royal family, and subsequently attempted to do what he could to alleviate their sufferings. In one of his most powerful speeches, he maintained the inviolability of the king&#x27;s person.

==Correspondence with Marie Antoinette==
It was during the escort of the royal family from Varennes back to Paris that Barnave first met queen Marie Antoinette. Though their initial interactions were marked by Barnave&#x27;s shy attempts to avoid eye contact, the queen was soon able to charm the twenty-nine-year-old politician and earn his favor. On the journey back to Paris, the two were reported to have been seen conversing intently on several occasions within the carriage, and near the rest stops. Purportedly, the subject of these conversations included Barnave and the rest of the Feuillants&#x27; fervent belief that a constitutional monarchy was the most viable solution for ending the revolution with a minimum of further bloodshed.

Much evidence indicates that, because her closest friends, including Count von Fersen, who had organized the flight from Paris, were absent, Marie Antoinette was attempting to influence Barnave and his fellow &quot;Feuillants&quot; as a way to ensure her family&#x27;s safety. She may also have dared to hope that it was still possible to reinstate some form of the former monarchy. Barnave was taken by the queen&#x27;s charm and waited for her to call on him when she was in grave circumstances.

A few weeks later, in early July 1791, Marie Antoinette wrote to Barnave the first of a long series of cryptic letters. Referring to him by a code name, Barnave received his letters through an unknown similarly codenamed intermediary. Her instructions were that her letter be read while the intermediary stood by to accept a reply. He then would return both documents to the queen. She herself never wrote any of the letters; instead, she dictated them so as to avoid embarrassing, and possibly incriminating, documentation. Barnave pursued the Queen&#x27;s support of furthering his political agenda of establishing a constitutional monarch. He believed that her support would improve the public opinion on the royal family by preventing her brother, the Emperor of Austria, from invading France and imposing upon it an absolutist monarchical state of government that conflicted with the ideals of the French Revolution. However, as communication between the two increased, it became evident to Barnave that Antoinette had no intentions of working alongside him but was in fact attempting to emotionally manipulate him. Their conversations led to nothing more than rejection by the Queen and suspicions leading Barnave to be labeled as a traitor to the French and their cause for revolution.

Eventually, the entire series of letters were smuggled out of the Tuileries to Count von Fersen who sent them to his sister in Sweden where they remain today. The letters revealed that Barnave was confident of his influence in the National Assembly, especially in light of the massacre at the &quot;Champ de Mars&quot;.

==Feuillant and fall from power==
As the Jacobin Club grew more radically in favor of a republic, Barnave and the other two members of the triumvirate broke away from it and formed the &quot;Feuillant&quot; political group on 18 July 1791. In July and August 1791, Barnave reached the height of his political prominence after 17 July 1791 Champ de Mars Massacre weakened the position of the Jacobins.

The &quot;Feuillants&quot; began to lose political power by early autumn, when disagreements arose with the growing influence of Jacques Pierre Brissot and his supporters, known as the Girondists. After the &quot;Feuillants&quot; opposed war against Austria, they were driven out of the Assembly. Barnave&#x27;s public career came to an end, and he returned to Grenoble at the beginning of 1792. His sympathy for and relations with the royal family, to whom he had submitted a plan for a counter-revolution, and his desire to check the violence of the Revolution, brought on him suspicion of treason.

He was denounced on 15 August 1792 in the Legislative Assembly, arrested and imprisoned for ten months in Grenoble, then transferred to Fort Barraux (also called &quot;Fort Saint-Barthélémy&quot;), near Barraux in the Isère department, and in November 1793 to Paris (during the Reign of Terror). On 28 November, he appeared before the Revolutionary Tribunal. He was condemned for treason on the evidence of papers detailing his extensive clandestine correspondence with Marie Antoinette discovered in Louis XVI&#x27;s &quot;armoire de fer&quot; at the Tuileries Palace. Barnave was guillotined in Paris the following day, 29 November 1793, as was Marguerite-Louis-François Duport-Dutertre, former Minister of Justice.

==Publications==
Barnave&#x27;s (posthumously published) &quot;Introduction à la rèvolution française&quot; anticipates in its sociology the work of Auguste Comte; and the Marxist concept of the mode of production.

Barnave&#x27;s belief that &quot;just as landed property is the basis of aristocracy and federalism, commercial property is the principle of democracy and unity&quot;, explicitly tied political relations to underlying differences in economic structures.

<doc id="158000" wikidata="Q345524" url="?curid=158000" title="William of Malmesbury">
<text>William of Malmesbury (; ) was the foremost English historian of the 12th century. He has been ranked among the most talented English historians since Bede. Modern historian C. Warren Hollister described him as &quot;a gifted historical scholar and an omnivorous reader, impressively well versed in the literature of classical, patristic, and earlier medieval times as well as in the writings of his own contemporaries. Indeed William may well have been the most learned man in twelfth-century Western Europe.&quot;

William was born about 1095 or 1096 in Wiltshire, England. His father was Norman and his mother English. He spent his whole life in England and his adult life as a monk at Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire.

==Biography==
Though the education William received at Malmesbury Abbey included a smattering of logic and physics, moral philosophy and history were the subjects to which he devoted the most attention. The earliest fact which he records of his career is that he assisted Abbot Godfrey (1081–1105) in collecting a library for the use of the community, and the evidence shows that William had first-hand knowledge of at least four hundred works by two hundred-odd authors. During the course of his studies, he amassed a collection of medieval histories, which inspired in him the idea for a popular account of English history modelled on the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;) of Bede. William&#x27;s obvious respect for Bede is apparent even within the preface of his &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot;, where he professes his admiration for the man.

In fulfilment of this idea, William completed in 1125 his &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of the English Kings&quot;), consciously patterned on Bede, which spanned from AD 449 to 1120. He later edited and expanded it up to the year 1127, releasing a revision dedicated to Robert, Earl of Gloucester. This &quot;second edition&quot; of the &quot;Gesta Regum&quot;, &quot;disclosing in his second thoughts the mellowing of age&quot;, is now considered one of the great histories of England.

William wrote of William the Conqueror in &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;:

William&#x27;s first edition of the book was followed by the &quot;Gesta Pontificum Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of the English Bishops&quot;) in 1125. For this vivid descriptive history of abbeys and bishoprics, dwelling upon the lives of the English prelates saints, notably the learned wonder-working Aldhelm, abbot of Malmesbury, William travelled widely in England. He stayed at Glastonbury Abbey for a time, composing &quot;On the Antiquity of the Glastonbury Church&quot; for his friend, the abbot Henry of Blois who was also the Bishop of Winchester. (Among the first works to mention SS Fagan and Deruvian, its present form is notably marred by anachronistic forgeries and additions.)

At a point before the onset of the Anarchy in 1139, William made the beneficial acquaintance of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, who possessed Malmesbury Castle. Such a beneficial local connection, combined with the positive reception of William&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Regum&quot;, led to an offer of the position of abbot of Malmesbury in 1140, which William declined, preferring his duties as a librarian and scholar. His one public appearance was made at the council of Winchester in 1141, in which the clergy declared for the Empress Matilda.

Beginning about 1140, William continued his chronicles with the &quot;Historia Novella&quot;, or &quot;modern history&quot;, a three-book chronicle that ran from 1128 to 1142, including important accounts of the Anarchy of King Stephen&#x27;s reign. This work breaks off with an unfulfilled promise that it would be continued: presumably William died before he could redeem his pledge. William also wrote a history of his abbey and several saints&#x27; lives.

==Significance==
William is considered by many, including John Milton, to be one of the best English historians of his time, and remains known for strong documentation and his clear, engaging writing style. A strong Latin stylist, he shows literary and historiographical instincts which are, for his time, remarkably sound. He is an authority of considerable value from 1066 onwards; many telling anecdotes and shrewd judgments on persons and events can be gleaned from his pages. Some scholars criticise him for his atypical annalistic form, calling his chronology less than satisfactory and his arrangement of material careless. Much of William&#x27;s work on Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester, is thought to derive from a first-hand account from Coleman, a contemporary of Wulfstan. William merely translated the document from Old English into Latin. William&#x27;s works are still considered invaluable and, despite these shortcomings, he remains one of the most celebrated English chroniclers of the twelfth century. 

William&#x27;s descriptions of religious communities, even though they &quot;resort to the hagiographic&quot;, especially about Benedictine convents such as Shaftesbury, Nunnaminster, and Wilton, give insights into the lives of nuns in England during the central Middle Ages. He observed their practices, which included their obedience to their leaders&#x27; directives, their care for and veneration of relics, their organization and participation in their practices of prayer and intercessions on the behalf of those in and out of their communities, and their reputations among the laity and their peers in other religious communities. His extensive travels throughout England also allowed him to compare the communities he studied and to accurately assess these communities&#x27; &quot;size, wealth, vibrancy, and rigour&quot;. According to medieval scholar and historian Katie Ann-Marie Bugyis, &quot;He was clearly impressed by the practices of the women&#x27;s monasteries he visited. By his telling, their sanctity and zeal equaled, if not surpassed, those of their male counterparts&quot;.

<text>North Lincolnshire is a unitary authority area with borough status in Lincolnshire, England. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 167,446. The administrative centre and largest settlement is Scunthorpe, and the borough also includes the towns of Brigg, Broughton, Haxey, Crowle, Epworth, Bottesford, Winterton, Kirton in Lindsey and Barton-upon-Humber. North Lincolnshire is part of the Yorkshire and the Humber region. The borough is mostly rural in character aside from near the town of Scunthorpe and near the Port of Immingham where most of the nearby villages and towns form part of the wider urban areas.

North Lincolnshire was formed following the abolition of Humberside County Council in 1996, when four unitary authorities replaced it, North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire, on the south bank of the Humber Estuary, and the East Riding of Yorkshire and Kingston upon Hull on the north bank.

It is home to the Haxey Hood, a traditional event which takes place in Haxey on 6 January, a large football scrum where a leather tube (the &quot;hood&quot;) is pushed to one of four pubs, where it remains until next year&#x27;s game.

==Location==

The council area lies on the south side of the Humber Estuary and consists mainly of agricultural land, including land on either side of the River Trent. It borders onto North East Lincolnshire, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. The council is based in Scunthorpe.
==History of area==

The former districts of Glanford, Scunthorpe, and the southern part of Boothferry, were non-metropolitan districts of the county of Humberside from 1974 to 1996. Humberside was abolished that year and those three districts merged to form the new unitary authority area of North Lincolnshire, as part of an expanded Lincolnshire ceremonial county. The area had previously been within the Lincolnshire administrative county before 1974 as a collection of municipal boroughs, urban districts, and rural districts. The new district of North Lincolnshire was awarded borough status on 16 December 1996, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

<text>Sir Joseph Barnby (12 August 183828 January 1896) was an English composer and conductor.

==Life==
Barnby was born at York, as a son of Thomas Barnby, who was an organist. Joseph was a chorister at York Minster from the age of seven. His voice broke at the age of fifteen and he studied for two to three years at the Royal Academy of Music under Cipriani Potter and Charles Lucas. He was narrowly beaten by Arthur Sullivan in competition for the Mendelssohn Scholarship. In 1862 he was appointed organist of St Andrew&#x27;s, Wells Street, London, where he raised the services to a high degree of excellence. It was at St Andrew&#x27;s that in 1864, Barnby and the choir performed two anthems by Alice Mary Smith; this is believed to be the first time that liturgical music composed by a woman was performed in the Church of England.

He was conductor of &quot;Barnby&#x27;s Choir&quot; from 1864, at first giving concerts at St James&#x27;s Hall and afterwards at Exeter Hall. In 1871 he was appointed, in succession to Charles Gounod, conductor of the Royal Albert Hall Choral Society, a post he held till his death. Meanwhile, he had left St Andrew&#x27;s for a similar position at St Anne&#x27;s, Soho. In 1875, he was precentor and director of music at Eton College, and in 1892 became principal of the Guildhall School of Music, receiving the honour of knighthood in July of that year. His works include an oratorio &quot;Rebekah&quot;, &quot;The Lord is King&quot; (Psalm 97), many services and anthems, and 246 hymn tunes (published in 1897 in one volume), as well as some partsongs and songs (among them, &quot;Now The Day Is Over&quot;, and the popular lullaby using Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s words &quot;Sweet and Low&quot;) and some pieces for the pipe organ.

Barnby was an advocate of J.S. Bach&#x27;s music, and proposed to Dean Stanley the 1870 performance of St John&#x27;s Passion, with full orchestra and choir of 500 voices. He was largely instrumental in stimulating the love for Gounod&#x27;s sacred music among the less educated part of the London public, although he displayed little practical sympathy with opera. On the other hand, he organized a remarkable concert performance of &quot;Parsifal&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 1884. He conducted the Cardiff Festivals of 1892 and 1895. He died in London and, after a special service in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral was buried in West Norwood Cemetery.

Discussing English composers, Barnby said: &quot;Sullivan, of course, has done his work in a straightforward way, and gained all the success he could have hoped for. With regard, however, to men bitten with a desire to produce advanced music, the result so far has been scarcely so satisfactory.&quot;

A possibly apocryphal story about him got as far as New Zealand: A young contralto at the end of a Handel solo put in a high note instead of the less effective note usually sung. The conductor, Barnby, was shocked, and asked whether Miss – thought she was right to improve on Handel. &quot;Well, Sir Joseph, said she, I’ve got an &#x27;E&#x27; and I don’t see why I shouldn’t show it off&quot;. &quot;Miss –,&quot; rejoined Barnby, &quot;I believe you have two knees, but I hope you won’t show them off here&quot;.

<text>Albert Barnes (December 1, 1798 – December 24, 1870) was an American theologian, clergyman, abolitionist, temperance advocate, and author. Barnes is best known for his extensive Bible commentary and notes on the Old and New Testaments, published in a total of 14 volumes in the 1830s.

==Biography==
Barnes was born in Rome, New York. He graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, New York in 1820, and from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1823. Barnes was ordained as a Presbyterian minister by the presbytery of Elizabethtown, New Jersey, in 1825, and was the pastor successively of the Presbyterian Church in Morristown, New Jersey (1825–1830), and of the First Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia (1830–1868).
Barnes held a prominent place in the New School branch of the Presbyterians during the Old School-New School Controversy, to which he adhered on the division of the denomination in 1837. He had been tried (but not convicted) for heresy in 1836, mostly due to the views he expressed in &quot;Notes, Explanatory and Practical, on the Epistle to the Romans&quot; (1834) of the imputation of the sin of Adam, original sin and the atonement; the bitterness stirred up by this trial contributed towards widening the breach between the conservative and the progressive elements in the church.

During the Old School-New School split in the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, Barnes allied himself with the New School Branch. He served as moderator of the General Assembly to the New School branch in 1851. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;: &quot;He was an eloquent preacher, but his reputation rests chiefly on his expository works, which are said to have had a larger circulation both in Europe and America than any others of their class.&quot;

Of the well-known &quot;Notes on the New Testament&quot;, it is said that more than a million volumes had been issued by 1870. The Notes on Job, the Psalms, Isaiah and Daniel were also popularly distributed. The popularity of these works rested on how Barnes simplified Biblical criticism so that new developments in the field were made accessible to the general public. Barnes was the author of several other works, including &quot;Scriptural Views of Slavery&quot; (1846) and &quot;The Way of Salvation&quot; (1863). A collection of his theological works was published in Philadelphia in 1875.

Barnes was an abolitionist. In his book &quot;The Church and Slavery&quot; (1857), Barnes excoriates slavery as evil and immoral, and calls for it to be dealt with from the pulpit &quot;as other sins and wrongs are&quot; (most pointedly in chapter VII, &quot;The Duty of the Church at Large on the Subject of Slavery&quot;). In his famous 1852 oratory, &quot;What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?&quot;, Frederick Douglass quoted Barnes as saying: &quot;There is no power out of the church that could sustain slavery an hour, if it were not sustained in it.&quot;

Barnes was a temperance advocate who encouraged complete abstinence from alcohol.

Barnes was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1855. While serving as pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia, Barnes became the President of the Pennsylvania Bible Society (located at 7th and Walnut) in 1858 – a position he served until his death in 1870. He served at First Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia until 1868. He was then granted the title Pastor Emeritus.

==Death==
Barnes died in Philadelphia on December 24, 1870, of natural causes, 23 days after his 72nd birthday. His widow wrote:
