<text>The radish (Raphanus sativus) is a flowering plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Its large taproot is commonly used as a root vegetable, although the entire plant is edible and its leaves are sometimes used as a leaf vegetable. Originally domesticated in Asia, radishes are now grown and consumed globally. The radish is sometimes considered to form a species complex with the wild radish, and instead given the trinomial name &quot;Raphanus raphanistrum&quot; subsp. &quot;sativus&quot;.

Radishes are often used raw as a crunchy salad vegetable with a pungent, slightly spicy flavor, varying in intensity depending on its growing environment. There are numerous varieties varying in size, flavor, color, and length of time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, common smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger &quot;daikon&quot; varieties take several weeks. Being relatively easy to grow and quick to harvest, radishes are often planted by novice gardeners. Another use of radish is as a cover or catch crop in winter, or as a forage crop. Some radishes are grown for their seeds; others, such as daikon, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.

== History ==
Varieties of radish are now broadly distributed globally, but almost no archeological records are available to help determine their early history and domestication. However, scientists have tentatively located the origin of &quot;Raphanus sativus&quot; in Southeast Asia, as this is the only region where truly wild forms have been discovered. India, central China, and Central Asia appear to have been secondary centers where differing forms were developed. Radishes enter the historical record in .

Greek and Roman agriculturalists of the gave details of small, large, round, long, mild, and sharp varieties. The radish seems to have been one of the first European crops introduced to the Americas. A German botanist reported radishes of and roughly in length in 1544, although the only variety of that size today is the Japanese Sakurajima radish. The large, mild, and white East Asian form was developed in China, though it is mostly associated in the West with the Japanese daikon, owing to Japanese agricultural development and larger exports.

===Folklore===
Asaph the Jew noted that the radish, particularly its leaves, may be useful in traditional medicine to increase mucus. During the Middle Ages, Ibn Wahshiyya considered it a component of poison antidotes, while Maimonides highlighted its possible uses as a treatment. Al-Warraq&#x27;s 10th-century cookbook includes radish as a side dish for ostrich meat and an ingredient in a chicken dish called &quot;kardanāj&quot;.

== Description ==
Radishes are annual or biennial brassicaceous crops grown for their swollen tap roots which can be globular, tapering, or cylindrical. The root skin colour ranges from white through pink, red, purple, yellow, and green to black, but the flesh is usually white. The roots obtain their color from anthocyanins. Red varieties use the anthocyanin pelargonidin as a pigment, and purple cultivars obtain their color from cyanidin. Smaller types have a few leaves about long with round roots up to in diameter or more slender, long roots up to long. Both of these are normally eaten raw in salads. A longer root form, including oriental radishes, daikon or mooli, and winter radishes, grows up to long with foliage about high with a spread of . The flesh of radishes harvested timely is crisp and sweet, but becomes bitter and tough if the vegetable is left in the ground too long. Leaves are arranged in a rosette. They have a lyrate shape, meaning they are divided pinnately with an enlarged terminal lobe and smaller lateral lobes. The white flowers are borne on a racemose inflorescence. The fruits are small pods which can be eaten when young.

The radish is a diploid species, and has 18 chromosomes (2&quot;n&quot;=18). It is estimated that the radish genome contains between 526 and 574 Mb.

=== Varieties ===
== Cultivation ==

Radishes are a fast-growing, annual, cool-season crop. The seed germinates in three to four days in moist conditions with soil temperatures between . Best quality roots are obtained under moderate day lengths with air temperatures in the range . Under average conditions, the crop matures in 3–4 weeks, but in colder weather, 6–7 weeks may be required. Homegrown varieties can be significantly sharper. 

Radishes grow best in full sun in light, sandy loams, with a soil pH 6.5 to 7.0, but for late-season crops, a clayey-loam is ideal. Soils that bake dry and form a crust in dry weather are unsuitable and can impair germination. Harvesting periods can be extended by making repeat plantings, spaced a week or two apart. In warmer climates, radishes are normally planted in the autumn. The depth at which seeds are planted affects the size of the root, from deep recommended for small radishes to for large radishes. During the growing period, the crop needs to be thinned and weeds controlled, and irrigation may be required.
Radishes are a common garden crop in many parts of the world, and the fast harvest cycle makes them particularly suitable for children&#x27;s gardens. After harvesting, radishes can be stored without loss of quality for two or three days at room temperature, and about two months at with a relative humidity of 90–95%.

=== Companion plant ===
Radishes can be useful as companion plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can also function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.

=== Pests ===
As a fast-growing plant, diseases are not generally a problem with radishes, but some insect pests can be a nuisance. The larvae of flea beetles live in the soil, but the adult beetles cause damage to the crop, biting small &quot;shot holes&quot; in the leaves, especially of seedlings. The swede midge (&quot;Contarinia nasturtii&quot;) attacks the foliage and growing tip of the plant and causes distortion, multiple (or no) growing tips, and swollen or crinkled leaves and stems. The larvae of the cabbage root fly sometimes attack the roots. The foliage droops and becomes discoloured, and small, white maggots tunnel through the root, making it unattractive or inedible.

== Varieties ==
Radishes can be categorized into four main types according to the seasons when they are grown and a variety of shapes, lengths, colors, and sizes, such as red, pink, white, gray-black, or yellow radishes, with round or elongated roots that can grow longer than a parsnip.

=== Spring or summer radishes ===
Sometimes referred to as European radishes or spring radishes if they are planted in cooler weather, summer radishes are generally small and have a relatively short three- to four-week cultivation time.
* The &#x27;April Cross&#x27; is a giant white radish hybrid that bolts very slowly.
* &#x27;Bunny Tail&#x27; is an heirloom variety from Italy, where it is known as &quot;Rosso Tondo A Piccola Punta Bianca&quot;. It is slightly oblong, mostly red, with a white tip.
* &#x27;Cherry Belle&#x27; is a bright red-skinned round variety with a white interior. It is familiar in North American supermarkets.
* &#x27;Champion&#x27; is round and red-skinned like the &#x27;Cherry Belle&#x27;, but with slightly larger roots, up to , and a milder flavor.
* &#x27;Red King&#x27; has a mild flavor, with good resistance to club root, a problem that can arise from poor drainage.
* &#x27;Sicily Giant&#x27; is a large heirloom variety from Sicily. It can reach up to 5 cm (2 in) in diameter.
* &#x27;Snow Belle&#x27; is an all-white variety of radish, similar in shape to the &#x27;Cherry Belle&#x27;.
* &#x27;White Icicle&#x27; or &#x27;Icicle&#x27; is a white carrot-shaped variety, around long, dating back to the 16th century. It slices easily and has better than average resistance to pithiness.
* &#x27;French Breakfast&#x27; is an elongated, red-skinned radish with a white splash at the root end. It is typically slightly milder than other summer varieties but is among the quickest to turn pithy.
* &#x27;Plum Purple&#x27;, a purple-fuchsia radish, tends to stay crisp longer than average.
* &#x27;Gala&#x27; and &#x27;Roodbol&#x27; are two varieties popular in the Netherlands in a breakfast dish, thinly sliced on buttered bread.
* &#x27;Easter Egg&#x27; is not an actual variety, but a mix of varieties with different skin colors, typically including white, pink, red, and purple radishes. Sold in markets or seed packets under the name, the seed mixes can extend harvesting duration from a single planting, as different varieties may mature at different times.

=== Winter varieties ===

&#x27;Black Spanish&#x27; or &#x27;Black Spanish Round&#x27; occur in both round and elongated forms, and are sometimes simply called the black radish (Raphanus sativus &quot;L. var. niger (M.) S.K.&quot; or &quot;L. ssp. niger (M.). D.C. var. albus D.C&quot;) or known by the French name &quot;Gros Noir d&#x27;Hiver&quot;. It dates in Europe to 1548, and was a common garden variety in England and France during the early 19th century. It has a rough, black skin with hot-flavored, white flesh, is round or irregularly pear shaped, and grows to around in diameter.

Daikon refers to a wide variety of winter oilseed radishes from Asia. While the Japanese name &quot;daikon&quot; has been adopted in English, it is also sometimes called the Japanese radish, Chinese radish, Oriental radish, or &quot;mooli&quot; (in India and South Asia). Daikons commonly have elongated white roots, although many varieties of daikon exist. One well-known variety is &#x27;April Cross&#x27;, with smooth white roots. &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes &#x27;Masato Red&#x27; and &#x27;Masato Green&#x27; varieties as extremely long, well-suited for fall planting and winter storage. The Sakurajima radish is a hot-flavored variety which is typically grown to around , but which can grow to when left in the ground.

Korean radish, also called mu(), is a variety of white radish with firm crunchy texture. Although &quot;mu&quot; is also a generic term for radishes in Korean (as &quot;daikon&quot; is a generic term for radishes in Japanese), the word is usually used in its narrow sense, referring to Joseon radish(, &quot;Joseonmu&quot;). In Korean cuisine context, the word Joseon is often used in contrast to Wae, to distinguish Korean varieties from Japanese ones. The longer, thinner, and waterier Japanese daikon cultivated mainly for danmuji is referred to as Wae radish(, &quot;Waemu&quot;) in Korea. Korean radishes are generally shorter, stouter, and sturdier than daikon, and have pale green shade halfway down from the top. They also have stronger flavour, denser flesh, and softer leaves. The greens of Korean radishes are called &quot;mucheong&quot;() and used as vegetable in various dishes.

=== Seed pod varieties ===

The seeds of radishes grow in siliques (widely referred to as &quot;pods&quot;), following flowering that happens when left to grow past their normal harvesting period. The seeds are edible and are sometimes used as a crunchy, sharp addition to salads. Some varieties are grown specifically for their seeds or seed pods, rather than their roots. The rat-tailed radish, an old European variety thought to have come from East Asia centuries ago, has long, thin, curly pods that can exceed in length. In the 17th century, the pods were often pickled and served with meat. The &#x27;München Bier&#x27; variety supplies seed pods that are sometimes served raw as an accompaniment to beer in Germany.

== Production ==
Using 2003–4 data, several sources report annual world production of radishes to be about 7 million tonnes, produced mainly by China, Japan, and South Korea, and representing roughly 2% of global vegetable production.

== Nutritional value ==

In a reference serving, raw radishes provide of food energy and have a moderate amount of vitamin C (18% of Daily Value), with other essential nutrients in low content (table). A raw radish is 95% water, 3% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat.

== Uses ==

=== Cooking ===

The most commonly eaten portion is the or taproot, although the entire plant is edible and the tops can be used as a leaf vegetable. The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw in a similar way to a mung bean.

The root of the radish is usually eaten raw, although tougher specimens can be steamed. The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form allyl isothiocyanates, also present in mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.

Radishes are mostly used in salads but also appear in many European dishes. In Mexican cuisine, sliced radishes are used in combination with shredded lettuce as garnish for traditional dishes such as tostadas, sopes, enchiladas and pozole.

Radish greens are usually discarded, but are edible and nutritious, and can be prepared in several ways. The leaves are sometimes used in recipes, like potato soup or as a sauteed side dish. They are also found blended with fruit juices in some recipes. 

In Indian cuisine the seed pods are called &quot;moongra&quot; or &quot;mogri&quot; and can be used in many dishes.

=== Other uses ===

The seeds of radishes can be pressed to extract radish seed oil. Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while not suitable for human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel. The daikon grows well in cool climates and, apart from its industrial use, can be used as a cover crop, grown to increase soil fertility, to scavenge nutrients, suppress weeds, help alleviate soil compaction, and prevent winter erosion of the soil.

&quot;Radi&quot;, a spiral-cut radish, served with salt and occasionally chives, is traditionally served with beer at the Bavarian Oktoberfest.

=== Culture ===
The daikon varieties of radish are important parts of East, Southeast, and South Asian cuisine. In Japan and Korea, radish dolls are sometimes made as children&#x27;s toys. Daikon is also one of the plants that make up the Japanese Festival of Seven Herbs (&quot;Nanakusa no sekku&quot;) on the seventh day after the new year.

Citizens of Oaxaca, Mexico, celebrate the Night of the Radishes (&quot;Noche de los rábanos&quot;) on December 23 as a part of Christmas celebrations. This folk art competition uses a large type of radish up to long and weighing up to . Great skill and ingenuity are used to carve these into religious and popular figures, buildings, and other objects, and they are displayed in the town square.

<text>Alba Giselle Blondet Gomez (born January 9, 1964) is a Puerto Rican actress and TV host. She also founded the non-profit organization &quot;Fundación Arte por La Paz&quot;.

==Early biography==
Giselle Blondet was born Alba Giselle Blondet, in 1964, to Victor Manuel Blondet and Alba Gomez, in New York, New York, but was raised and studied in Puerto Rico.

In 1982 she married her first husband, jeweler Luis Iglesias, with whom she had a daughter, Andrea. They divorced two years later in 1984.

In 1986 she married again, this second time to actor Luis Abreu. That marriage did not last long, and they divorced shortly after. Blondet spent the rest of the late 1980s participating in different television shows, soap operas, and mini-series, as well as in some theater plays.

During the early 1990s, Blondet recorded a popular television commercial in Puerto Rico for the feminine hygiene brand, Always.

In 1989, she married for a third time, to Argentine producer Harold Trucco. They had a daughter, Gabriella, and a son, Harold Emmanuel. By way of that marriage, she was the sister-in-law of actor Ed Trucco. The relationship encountered problems and ended in 1997. In June 1997, her career took off internationally as she became co-host for Univision&#x27;s international morning show, &quot;¡Despierta América!&quot;, alongside Rafael José, Fernando Arau, Ana Maria Canseco, and Neida Sandoval. Since divorcing Trucco, she has remained single and says she wants to dedicate her free time to her children.

==Later career==
In 2004, Blondet published her autobiography &quot;Con los Pies en la Tierra&quot;. The following year, she left &quot;Despierta América&quot; to host a new television show about real-life tragedies, entitled &quot;Historias Para Contar&quot;, but it resulted in a series of small special episodes. In 2006, she starred in a Spanish-language Christmas movie alongside José Feliciano and Raúl De Molina entitled &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot;. Blondet&#x27;s movie was due to be released later that year, but was released to DVD. In 2007, she was given the opportunity to become the host of a reality show in Univision, called &quot;Nuestra Belleza Latina&quot; (Our Latin Beauty). The show has hints of &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, and &quot;Miss Universe&quot;, and was an early hit.

In 2010, after 14 years away from acting, she starred in an episode of &quot;Mujeres Asesinas&quot; as Luz Maria, alongside Cynthia Klitbo in the episode &quot;Luz, Arrolladora&quot;.

In February 2012, she was one of a group of celebrities who walked down a catwalk in red dresses for the &#x27;Heart Truth Red Dress Collection&#x27; show, part of New York Fashion Week. She wore an Oscar de la Renta dress.

In December 2013, after hosting Univision&#x27;s &quot;Nuestra Belleza Latina&quot; for seven years, she announced that she was leaving the hit show to pursue other opportunities and hoped to produce her own TV show in the future. Her role as host was taken over by Chiquinquirá Delgado.

In June 2014, she launched her jewelry and bedding collections for Gi by Giselle Blondet through Walmart in Puerto Rico. The business become a success throughout the island and was projected to reach the United States before Fall 2014. She also decided to release a second book titled, &quot;Tengo 50...Y que?!&quot; (I&#x27;m 50...so what?!), which is a collection of anecdotes aiming to help women transition into the age of 50. The expected release of the book was also Fall 2014.

In January 2016, she joined Telemundo and was the host of &quot;Gran Hermano&quot;. The show was cancelled after one season.

In February 2017, she returned to Univision to become the host of &quot;Pequeños Gigantes USA&quot;.

During Nuestra Belleza Latina&#x27;s 2018 season, Blondet returned, as presiding judge.

<doc id="164500" wikidata="Q561408" url="?curid=164500" title="Thomas Love Peacock">
<text>Thomas Love Peacock (18 October 1785 – 23 January 1866) was an English novelist, poet, and official of the East India Company. He was a close friend of Percy Bysshe Shelley and they influenced each other&#x27;s work. Peacock wrote satirical novels, each with the same basic setting: characters at a table discussing and criticising the philosophical opinions of the day.

== Background and education ==

Peacock was born in Weymouth, Dorset, the son of Samuel Peacock and his wife Sarah Love, daughter of Thomas Love, a retired master of a man-of-war in the Royal Navy. His father was a glass merchant in London, partner of a Mr Pellatt, presumed to be Apsley Pellatt (1763–1826). Peacock went with his mother to live with her family at Chertsey in 1791 and in 1792 went to a school run by Joseph Harris Wicks at Englefield Green where he stayed for six and a half years.

Peacock&#x27;s father died in 1794 in &quot;poor circumstances&quot; leaving a small annuity. Peacock&#x27;s first known poem was an epitaph for a school fellow written at the age of ten and another on his &quot;Midsummer Holidays&quot; was written when he was thirteen. Around that time in 1798 he was abruptly taken from school and from then on was entirely self-educated.

== Early occupation and travelling ==
In February 1800, Peacock became a clerk with Ludlow Fraser Company, who were merchants in the City of London. He lived with his mother on the firm&#x27;s premises at 4 Angel Court Throgmorton Street. He won the eleventh prize from the Monthly Preceptor for a verse answer to the question &quot;Is History or Biography the More Improving Study?&quot;. He also contributed to &quot;The Juvenile Library&quot;, a magazine for youth whose competitions excited the emulation of several other boys including Leigh Hunt, de Quincey, and W. J. Fox. He began visiting the Reading Room of the British Museum and continued doing so for many years, diligently studying the best literature in Greek, Latin, French, and Italian. In 1804 and 1806 he published two volumes of poetry, &quot;The Monks of St. Mark&quot; and &quot;Palmyra&quot;. Some of Peacock&#x27;s juvenile compositions were privately printed by Sir Henry Cole.

In around 1806 Peacock left his job in the city and during the year made a solitary walking tour of Scotland. The annuity left by his father expired in October 1806. In 1807 he returned to live at his mother&#x27;s house at Chertsey. He was briefly engaged to Fanny Faulkner, but it was broken off through the interference of her relations. His friends, as he hints, thought it wrong that so clever a man should be earning so little money. In the autumn of 1808 he became private secretary to Sir Home Popham, commanding the fleet before Flushing. By the end of the year he was serving Captain Andrew King aboard in the Downs. His preconceived affection for the sea did not reconcile him to nautical realities. &quot;Writing poetry,&quot; he says, &quot;or doing anything else that is rational, in this floating inferno, is next to a moral impossibility. I would give the world to be at home and devote the winter to the composition of a comedy.&quot; He did write prologues and addresses for dramatic performances on board HMS &quot;Venerable&quot;. His dramatic taste then and for the next nine years resulted in attempts at comedies and lighter pieces, all of which lacked ease of dialogue and suffered from over-elaborated incident and humour. He left HMS &quot;Venerable&quot; in March 1809 at Deal and walked around Ramsgate in Kent before returning home to Chertsey. He had sent his publisher Edward Hookham a little poem of the River Thames which he expanded during the year into &quot;The Genius of the Thames&quot;. On 29 May he set out on a two-week expedition to trace the course of the Thames from its source to Chertsey and spent two or three days staying in Oxford.

Peacock travelled to North Wales in January 1810 where he visited Tremadog and settled at Maentwrog in Merionethshire. At Maentwrog he was attracted to the parson&#x27;s daughter Jane Gryffydh, whom he referred to as the &quot;Caernavonshire nymph&quot;. Early in June 1810, the &quot;Genius of the Thames&quot; was published by Thomas and Edward Hookham. Early in 1811 he left Maentwrog to walk home via South Wales. He climbed Cadair Idris and visited Edward Scott at Bodtalog near Tywyn. He also visited William Madocks at Dolmelynllyn. His journey included Aberystwyth and Devil&#x27;s Bridge, Ceredigion. Later in 1811, his mother&#x27;s annuity expired and she had to leave Chertsey and moved to Morven Cottage Wraysbury near Staines with the help of some friends. In 1812 they had to leave Morven Cottage over problems paying tradesmen&#x27;s bills.

== Friendship with Shelley ==

In 1812 Peacock published another elaborate poem, &quot;The Philosophy of Melancholy&quot;, and in the same year made the acquaintance of Shelley. He wrote in his memoir of Shelley, that he &quot;saw Shelley for the first time just before he went to Tanyrallt&quot;, whither Shelley proceeded from London in November 1812 (Hogg&#x27;s &quot;Life of Shelley&quot;, vol. 2, pp. 174, 175.) Thomas Hookham, the publisher of all Peacock&#x27;s early writings, was possibly responsible for the introduction. It was Hookham&#x27;s circulating library which Shelley used for many years, and Hookham had sent &quot;The Genius of the Thames&quot; to Shelley, and in the &quot;Shelley Memorials&quot;, pp. 38–40, is a letter from the poet dated 18 August 1812, extolling the poetical merits of the performance and with equal exaggeration censuring what he thought the author&#x27;s misguided patriotism. Peacock and Shelley became friends and Peacock influenced Shelley&#x27;s fortunes both before and after his death.

In the winter of 1813 Peacock accompanied Shelley and his first wife Harriet to Edinburgh. Peacock was fond of Harriet, and in his old age defended her reputation from slanders spread by Jane, Lady Shelley, the daughter-in-law of Shelley&#x27;s second wife Mary.

In 1814 Peacock published a satirical ballad, &quot;Sir Proteus&quot;, which appeared under the pseudonym &quot;P. M. O&#x27;Donovan, Esq.&quot; Shelley resorted to him during the agitation of mind which preceded his separation from Harriet. After Shelley deserted Harriet, Peacock became an almost daily visitor throughout the winter of 1814–15 of Shelley and Mary Godwin (later Mary Shelley), at their London lodgings. In 1815 Peacock shared their voyage to the source of the Thames. &quot;He seems&quot;, writes Charles Clairmont, Mary Godwin&#x27;s stepbrother and a member of the party, &quot;an idly-inclined man; indeed, he is professedly so in the summer; he owns he cannot apply himself to study, and thinks it more beneficial to him as a human being entirely to devote himself to the beauties of the season while they last; he was only happy while out from morning till night&quot;. By September 1815 when Shelley had taken up residence at Bishopsgate, near Windsor, Peacock had settled at Great Marlow. Peacock wrote &quot;Headlong Hall&quot; in 1815, and it was published the following year. With this work Peacock found the true field for his literary gift in the satiric novel, interspersed with delightful lyrics, amorous, narrative, or convivial.

During the winter of 1815–16 Peacock was regularly walking over to visit Shelley at Bishopgate. There he met Thomas Jefferson Hogg, and &quot;the winter was a mere Atticism. Our studies were exclusively Greek&quot;. In 1816 Shelley went abroad, and Peacock appears to have been entrusted with the task of finding the Shelleys a new residence. He fixed them near his own home at Great Marlow. Peacock received a pension from Shelley for a time, and was put into requisition to keep off wholly unauthorised intruders upon Shelley&#x27;s hospitable household. Peacock was consulted about alterations in Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Laon and Cythna,&quot; and Peacock&#x27;s enthusiasm for Greek poetry probably had some influence on Shelley&#x27;s work. Shelley&#x27;s influence upon Peacock may be traced in the latter&#x27;s poem of &quot;Rhododaphne, or the Thessalian Spell,&quot; published in 1818 and Shelley wrote a eulogistic review of it. Peacock also wrote at this time the satirical novels &quot;Melincourt&quot; published in 1817 and &quot;Nightmare Abbey&quot; published in 1818. Shelley made his final departure for Italy and the friends&#x27; agreement for mutual correspondence produced Shelley&#x27;s magnificent descriptive letters from Italy, which otherwise might never have been written.

Peacock told Shelley that &quot;he did not find this brilliant summer,&quot; of 1818, &quot;very favourable to intellectual exertion;&quot; but before it was quite over &quot;rivers, castles, forests, abbeys, monks, maids, kings, and banditti were all dancing before me like a masked ball.&quot; He was at this time writing his romance of &quot;Maid Marian&quot; which he had completed except for the last three chapters.

== East India Company ==

At the beginning of 1819, Peacock was unexpectedly summoned to London for a period of probation with the East India Company who needed to reinforce their staff with talented people. They summoned to their service in the Examiner&#x27;s office James Mill and three others. Peacock was included at the recommendation of Peter Auber, the company historian, whom he had known at school, though probably not as a school-fellow. Peacock&#x27;s test papers earned the high commendation, &quot;Nothing superfluous and nothing wanting.&quot; On 13 January 1819, he wrote from 5 York Street, Covent Garden: &quot;I now pass every morning at the India House, from half-past 10 to half-past 4, studying Indian affairs. My object is not yet attained, though I have little doubt but that it will be. It was not in the first instance of my own seeking, but was proposed to me. It will lead to a very sufficing provision for me in two or three years. It is not in the common routine of office, but is an employment of a very interesting and intellectual kind, connected with finance and legislation, in which it is possible to be of great service, not only to the Company, but to the millions under their dominion.&quot;

On 1 July 1819 Peacock slept for the first time in a house at 18 Stamford Street, Blackfriars which, &quot;as you might expect from a Republican, he has furnished very handsomely.&quot; His mother continued to live with him in Stamford Street.

In 1820 Peacock contributed to Ollier&#x27;s &quot;Literary Pocket Book&quot; and wrote &quot;The Four Ages of Poetry,&quot; the latter of which argued that poetry&#x27;s relevance was being ended by science, a claim which provoked Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Defence of Poetry&quot;. The official duties of the India House delayed the completion and publication of &quot;Maid Marian&quot;, begun in 1818, until 1822, and as a result of the delay it was taken for an imitation of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; although its composition had, in fact, preceded Scott&#x27;s novel. It was soon dramatised with great success by Planché, and was translated into French and German. Peacock&#x27;s salary was now £1000 a year, and in 1823 he acquired a country residence at Lower Halliford, near Shepperton, Middlesex, constructed out of two old cottages, where he could gratify the love of the Thames, which was as strong as his enthusiasm for classical literature. In the winter of 1825–26 he wrote &quot;Paper Money Lyrics and other Poems&quot; &quot;during the prevalence of an influenza to which the beautiful fabric of paper-credit is periodically subject.&quot; In his early time at the India Office he wrote little except for the operatic criticisms which he regularly contributed to &quot;The Examiner&quot;, and an occasional article in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; or &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;.

Peacock showed great ability in business and in the drafting of official papers. In 1829 he began to devote attention to steam navigation, and composed a memorandum for General Chesney&#x27;s Euphrates expedition, which was praised both by Chesney and Lord Ellenborough. He opposed the employment of steamers on the Red Sea, probably in deference to the supposed interests of the company. In 1829 he published &quot;The Misfortunes of Elphin&quot; founded upon Welsh traditions, and in 1831 the novel &quot;Crotchet Castle&quot;, the most mature and thoroughly characteristic of all his works. He was greatly affected by the death of his mother in 1833 and said himself that he never wrote anything with interest afterwards.

Peacock often appeared before parliamentary committees as the company&#x27;s champion. In this role in 1834, he resisted James Silk Buckingham&#x27;s claim to compensation for his expulsion from the East Indies, and in 1836, he defeated the attack of the Liverpool merchants and Cheshire manufacturers upon the Indian salt monopoly. In 1836 his official career was crowned by his appointment as Chief Examiner of Indian Correspondence, in succession to James Mill. The post was one which could only be filled by someone of sound business capacity and exceptional ability in drafting official documents: and Peacock&#x27;s discharge of its duties, it is believed, suffered nothing by comparison either with his distinguished predecessor or his still more celebrated successor, Stuart Mill. In 1837 appeared his &quot;Paper Money Lyrics and other Poems&quot; of which only one hundred copies were printed. Also in 1837, &quot;Headlong Hall&quot;, &quot;Nightmare Abbey&quot;, &quot;Maid Marian&quot;, and &quot;Crotchet Castle&quot; appeared together as vol. 57 of &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Standard Novels&quot;. During 1839 and 1840 Peacock superintended the construction of iron steamers which rounded the Cape, and took part in the Chinese war.

Peacock&#x27;s occupation was principally with finance, commerce, and public works.

He wrote a poem on &quot;A Day at the India Office&quot;:

In about 1852 towards the end of Peacock&#x27;s service in the India office, his zeal or leisure for authorship returned, and he began to contribute to &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in which appeared his entertaining and scholarly &quot;Horæ Dramaticæ,&quot; a restoration of the &quot;Querolus&quot;, a Roman comedy probably of the time of Diocletian, and his reminiscences of Shelley.

== Later life ==
Peacock retired from the India House on 29 March 1856 with an ample pension. In his retirement he seldom left Halliford and spent his life among his books, and in the garden, in which he took great pleasure, and on the River Thames. In 1860 he still showed vigour by the publication in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; of &quot;Gryll Grange&quot;, his last novel. In the same year he added the appendix of Shelley&#x27;s letters. His last writings were two translations, &quot;Gl&#x27; Ingannati (The Deceived)&quot; a comedy, performed at Siena in 1861 and &quot;Ælia Lælia Crispis&quot; of which a limited edition was circulated in 1862.

Peacock died at Lower Halliford, 23 January 1866, from injuries sustained in a fire in which he had attempted to save his library, and was buried in the new cemetery at Shepperton.

His granddaughter remembered him in these words:

Sir Edward Strachey wrote of him:

Richard Garnett in the Dictionary of National Biography described Peacock as:

==Family==
Peacock married Jane Griffith or Gryffydh in 1820. In his &quot;Letter to Maria Gisborne&quot;, Shelley referred to Jane as &quot;the milk-white Snowdonian Antelope.&quot; Peacock had four children, a son Edward who was a champion rower, and three daughters. One of them, Mary Ellen, married the novelist George Meredith as her second husband in August 1849. Only his son survived him, and he for less than a year, but he left several grandchildren. Jane Peacock died in 1865.
Canada boasts the majority of Peacock relatives including Tommy Peacock.

== Works ==

Peacock&#x27;s own place in literature is pre-eminently that of a satirist. That he has nevertheless been the favourite only of the few is owing partly to the highly intellectual quality of his work, but mainly to his lack of ordinary qualifications of the novelist, all pretension to which he entirely disclaims. He has no plot, little human interest, and no consistent delineation of character. His personages are mere puppets, or, at best, incarnations of abstract qualities such as grace or beauty, but beautifully depicted.

His comedy combines the mock-Gothic with the Aristophanic. He suffers from that dramatist&#x27;s faults and, though not as daring in invention or as free in the use of sexual humour, shares many of his strengths. His greatest intellectual love is for Ancient Greece, including late and minor works such as the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; of Nonnus; many of his characters are given punning names taken from Greek to indicate their personality or philosophy.

He tended to dramatize where traditional novelists narrated; he is more concerned with the interplay of ideas and opinions than of feelings and emotions; his &quot;dramatis personae&quot; is more likely to consist of a cast of more or less equal characters than of one outstanding hero or heroine and a host of minor auxiliaries; his novels have a tendency to approximate the Classical unities, with few changes of scene and few if any subplots; his novels are novels of conversation rather than novels of action; in fact, Peacock is so much more interested in what his characters say to one another than in what they do to one another that he often sets out entire chapters of his novels in dialogue form. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; is the literary ancestor of these works, by way of the &quot;Deipnosophists&quot; of Athenaeus, in which the conversation relates less to exalted philosophical themes than to the points of a good fish dinner.

===Editions===
Modern paperback editions of Peacock&#x27;s works are almost nonexistent. The standard edition of Peacock&#x27;s verse and prose is the Halliford edition, edited by H. F. B. Brett-Smith and C. E. Jones and published in ten volumes between 1924 and 1934.
*Brett-Smith, H. F. B. (ed.) &quot;The Four Ages of Poetry etc.&quot; (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1953) [no ISBN]. Contains &quot;The Four Ages of Poetry&quot;, as well as P. B. Shelley&#x27;s response &quot;Defence of Poetry&quot;, and Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Shelley&quot;. 3rd volume of The Percy Reprints series. The text is presumably that of the Halliford edition. Out of print.

<doc id="164501" wikidata="Q2392819" url="?curid=164501" title="Nimber">
<text>In mathematics, the nimbers, also called Grundy numbers, are introduced in combinatorial game theory, where they are defined as the values of heaps in the game Nim. The nimbers are the ordinal numbers endowed with &quot;nimber addition&quot; and &quot;nimber multiplication&quot;, which are distinct from ordinal addition and ordinal multiplication.

Because of the Sprague–Grundy theorem which states that every impartial game is equivalent to a Nim heap of a certain size, nimbers arise in a much larger class of impartial games. They may also occur in partisan games like Domineering.

The nimber addition and multiplication operations are associative and commutative. Each nimber is its own additive inverse. In particular for some pairs of ordinals, their nimber sum is smaller than either addend. The minimum excludant operation is applied to sets of nimbers.

== Uses ==

=== Nim ===

Nim is a game in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. As moves depend only on the position and not on which of the two players is currently moving, and where the payoffs are symmetric, Nim is an impartial game. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap. The goal of the game is to be the player who removes the last object. The nimber of a heap is simply the number of objects in that heap. Using nim addition, one can calculate the nimber of the game as a whole. The winning strategy is to force the nimber of the game to 0 for the opponent&#x27;s turn.

=== Cram ===

Cram is a game often played on a rectangular board in which players take turns placing dominoes either horizontally or vertically until no more dominoes can be placed. The first player that cannot make a move loses. As the possible moves for both players are the same, it is an impartial game and can have a nimber value. For example, any board that is an even size by an even size will have a nimber of 0. Any board that is even by odd will have a non-zero nimber. Any board will have a nimber of 0 for all even and a nimber of 1 for all odd .

=== Northcott&#x27;s game ===
In Northcott&#x27;s game, pegs for each player are placed along a column with a finite number of spaces. Each turn each player must move the piece up or down the column, but may not move past the other player&#x27;s piece. Several columns are stacked together to add complexity. The player that can no longer make any moves loses. Unlike many other nimber related games, the number of spaces between the two tokens on each row are the sizes of the Nim heaps. If your opponent increases the number of spaces between two tokens, just decrease it on your next move. Else, play the game of Nim and make the Nim-sum of the number of spaces between the tokens on each row be 0.

=== Hackenbush ===

Hackenbush is a game invented by mathematician John Horton Conway. It may be played on any configuration of colored line segments connected to one another by their endpoints and to a &quot;ground&quot; line. Players take turns removing line segments. An impartial game version, thereby a game able to be analyzed using nimbers, can be found by removing distinction from the lines, allowing either player to cut any branch. Any segments reliant on the newly removed segment in order to connect to the ground line are removed as well. In this way, each connection to the ground can be considered a nim heap with a nimber value. Additionally, all the separate connections to the ground line can also be summed for a nimber of the game state.

== Addition ==
Nimber addition (also known as nim-addition) can be used to calculate the size of a single nim heap equivalent to a collection of nim heaps. It is defined recursively by
formula_1
where the minimum excludant of a set of ordinals is defined to be the smallest ordinal that is &quot;not&quot; an element of .

For finite ordinals, the nim-sum is easily evaluated on a computer by taking the bitwise exclusive or (XOR, denoted by ) of the corresponding numbers. For example, the nim-sum of 7 and 14 can be found by writing 7 as 111 and 14 as 1110; the ones place adds to 1; the twos place adds to 2, which we replace with 0; the fours place adds to 2, which we replace with 0; the eights place adds to 1. So the nim-sum is written in binary as 1001, or in decimal as 9.

This property of addition follows from the fact that both and XOR yield a winning strategy for Nim and there can be only one such strategy; or it can be shown directly by induction: Let and be two finite ordinals, and assume that the nim-sum of all pairs with one of them reduced is already defined.

Nimber addition is associative and commutative, with as the additive identity element. Moreover, a nimber is its own additive inverse. It follows that if and only if .

== Multiplication ==
Nimber multiplication (nim-multiplication) is defined recursively by

formula_6

Nimber multiplication is associative and commutative, with the ordinal as the multiplicative identity element. Moreover, nimber multiplication distributes over nimber addition.

Thus, except for the fact that nimbers form a proper class and not a set, the class of nimbers forms a ring. In fact, it even determines an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2, with the nimber multiplicative inverse of a nonzero ordinal given by

formula_7
where is the smallest set of ordinals (nimbers) such that
# is an element of ;
# if and is an element of , then formula_8 is also an element of .

For all natural numbers , the set of nimbers less than form the Galois field of order . Therefore, the set of finite nimbers is isomorphic to the direct limit as of the fields . This subfield is not algebraically closed, since no field with not a power of 2 is contained in any of those fields, and therefore not in their direct limit; for instance the polynomial , which has a root in , does not have a root in the set of finite nimbers.

Just as in the case of nimber addition, there is a means of computing the nimber product of finite ordinals. This is determined by the rules that

# The nimber product of a Fermat 2-power (numbers of the form ) with a smaller number is equal to their ordinary product;
# The nimber square of a Fermat 2-power is equal to as evaluated under the ordinary multiplication of natural numbers.

The smallest algebraically closed field of nimbers is the set of nimbers less than the ordinal , where is the smallest infinite ordinal. It follows that as a nimber, is transcendental over the field.

== Addition and multiplication tables ==
The following tables exhibit addition and multiplication among the first 16 nimbers.

This subset is closed under both operations, since 16 is of the form .

<doc id="164502" wikidata="Q1210832" url="?curid=164502" title="The Adventures of Baron Munchausen">
<text>The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a 1988 fantasy adventure film co-written and directed by Terry Gilliam, starring John Neville, Eric Idle, Sarah Polley, Oliver Reed, Uma Thurman, Jonathan Pryce and Valentina Cortese. An international co-production of the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany, the film is based on the tall tales of the 18th-century German nobleman, Baron Munchausen, and his wartime exploits against the Ottoman Empire.

The film was a box office bomb, grossing only $8 million domestically and losing millions for Columbia Pictures. Despite this, it received positive reviews from critics, and was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Best Visual Effects.

==Plot==
In an unnamed war-torn European city in the &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, as a large Ottoman army prepares an invasion outside the city gates, a fanciful touring stage production of Baron Munchausen&#x27;s life and adventures is taking place. In a theatre box, the mayor, &quot;The Right Ordinary&quot; Horatio Jackson, reinforces the city&#x27;s commitment to reason by ordering the execution of a soldier who had just accomplished a near-superhuman feat of bravery, claiming that his bravery is demoralizing to other soldiers and citizens.

The play is interrupted by an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theatre company and Jackson, the &quot;real&quot; Baron gains the house&#x27;s attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, in which the younger Baron&#x27;s life is saved only by his amazing luck, plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold, the world&#x27;s fastest runner; Adolphus, a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus, who possesses extraordinary hearing and powerful lungs; and the fantastically strong Albrecht.

When gunfire disrupts the elderly Baron&#x27;s story, Jackson cancels the acting troupe&#x27;s contract because of the Baron. The Baron wanders backstage, where the Angel of Death tries to take his life, but Sally Salt, the young daughter of the theatre company&#x27;s leader, saves him and persuades him to remain living. Sally races to the wall, yelling for the Turkish army to leave. The Baron accidentally fires himself through the sky using a mortar, and returns riding a cannonball, narrowly escaping the Angel of Death again. Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes over the city&#x27;s walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women&#x27;s underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway.

The balloon expedition proceeds to the Moon, where the Baron, who has grown younger, finds Berthold, but angers the King of the Moon, a giant with separate minds in his head and body, and who resents the Baron for his romantic past with the Queen of the Moon. The death of the King&#x27;s body and a bungled escape from the Moon bring the trio back to the Earth and into the volcano of the Roman god, Vulcan. He hosts the group as his guests, and reveals that Albrecht is working as his servant. The Baron and Vulcan&#x27;s wife, Venus, attempt a romantic interlude by waltzing in the air, prompting an irate Vulcan to expel the foursome from his kingdom into the South Seas.

Swallowed by an enormous sea creature, the travellers locate Gustavus, Adolphus and the Baron&#x27;s trusty horse, Bucephalus. The Baron (who appears elderly again after being &quot;expelled from a state of bliss&quot;) encounters the Angel of Death for the fourth time. They escape by blowing &quot;a modicum of snuff&quot; into the sea creature&#x27;s cavernous interior, causing it to sneeze the heroes out through its whale-like blowhole. The Baron, young again, sails to where the Turkish army is located, but his associates are too elderly and tired to fight.

The Baron firmly lectures them, but to no avail, so he storms off, intending to surrender to the Grand Turk. His companions rally to save the Baron, and, through a series of fantastic acts, they rout the Turkish army and liberate the city. During the city&#x27;s celebratory parade, the Baron is shot dead by Jackson, and the Angel of Death appears for a final time to take the Baron&#x27;s life. An emotional public funeral takes place, but the denouement reveals that this is merely the final scene of yet another story that the Baron is telling to the same theatregoers in the city. The Baron calls the foregoing &quot;only one of the many occasions on which I met my death&quot;, and closes his tale by saying that &quot;everyone who had a talent for it lived happily ever after&quot;.

The Baron leads the citizens to the city gates to reveal that the city has indeed been saved, although it is unclear if the events of the battle occurred in a tall tale or in reality. Sally asks, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just a story, was it?&quot; The Baron grins, rides away on Bucephalus, and disappears.

==Cast==

In addition, Robin Williams—credited as &quot;Ray D. Tutto&quot; (a play on &quot;king of everything&quot; in Italian)—portrays the King of the Moon. Director Terry Gilliam explained, &quot;The deal was that we couldn&#x27;t use his [Williams] name because his agents said, &#x27;We don&#x27;t want you pimping his ass for your film.&#x27; [...] so that&#x27;s why Robin is not credited.&quot; Sting has a credited cameo as a soldier executed for being a hero (&quot;behaviour demoralizing to ordinary soldiers&quot;), and Gilliam has an uncredited cameo as an irritating singer.

==Production==
===Background===
Tall tales, loosely based on the German adventurer Hieronymus Karl Friedrich Freiherr von Münchhausen, or Baron Munchausen, were compiled by Rudolf Erich Raspe and published for English readers in 1785 as &quot;&quot; (or &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Narrative of His Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia&quot;). The tales were further embellished and translated back to German by Gottfried August Bürger in 1786. These tales were frequently extended and translated throughout the 19th century, further fictionalized in the 1901 American novel, &quot;Mr. Munchausen&quot;.

The stories were adapted into various films, including &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1911, by Georges Méliès), &quot;Münchhausen&quot; (1943, by Josef von Báky, with a script by Erich Kästner), &quot;The Fabulous Baron Munchausen&quot; (1961, by Karel Zeman) and &quot;The Very Same Munchhausen&quot; (1979), directed by Mark Zakharov, who depicted Munchausen as a tragic character, struggling against the conformity and hypocrisy of the world around him.

===Budget===
The film went over budget; what was originally $23.5 million grew to a reported $46.63 million. Gilliam, acknowledging that he had gone over budget, said that its final costs had been nowhere near $40 million.

In &quot;The Madness and Misadventures of Munchausen&quot; (included on the bonus DVD of the 20th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Munchausen&quot;), producer Thomas Schühly said that, as part of a deal with 20th Century Fox before it went to Columbia, a budget plan had been set up for $35 million, &quot;and it&#x27;s strange, the [film&#x27;s] final cost was 35 [million]... We always had a budget of 34 or 35 million, the problem was when I started to discuss it with Columbia, Columbia would not go beyond 25... Everybody knew from the very beginning that this cutting out was just a fake... The problem was that David Puttnam got fired, and all these deals were oral deals... Columbia&#x27;s new CEO, Dawn Steel, said, &#x27;Whatever David Puttnam [has] said before doesn&#x27;t interest me&#x27;.&quot;

Regarding the new regime&#x27;s apparent animosity towards all of Puttnam&#x27;s projects and &quot;Munchausen&quot;, Gilliam added in the same documentary, &quot;I was trying very hard to convince Dawn Steel that this was not a David Puttnam movie, it was a Terry Gilliam movie.&quot; Similarly, Kent Houston, head of Peerless Camera, which was doing the film&#x27;s special effects, said in &quot;Madness and Misadventures&quot; that they were promised a bonus if they would finish the effects in time, but when they approached the person again when they were done, he was met with the reply, &quot;I&#x27;m not gonna pay you, because I don&#x27;t want to seem to be doing anything that could benefit Terry Gilliam.&quot;

===Experience===
&quot;Munchausen&quot; is the third entry in Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Trilogy of Imagination&quot;, preceded by &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981) and &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985). All are about the &quot;craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible&quot;. Gilliam explained, &quot;The one theme that runs through all three of these pictures is a consistently serious battle between fantasy and what people perceive as reality.&quot; All three films focus on these struggles, and attempt to escape them through imagination: &quot;Time Bandits&quot;, through the eyes of a child, &quot;Brazil&quot;, through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and &quot;Munchausen&quot;, through the eyes of an elderly man.

When the production finally came to a successful close, several of the actors commented on the rushed tightness of the whole project. Eric Idle said, &quot;Up until &quot;Munchausen&quot;, I&#x27;d always been very smart about Terry Gilliam films. You don&#x27;t ever [want to] be in them. Go and see them by all means – but to be in them, fucking madness!!!&quot;

Sarah Polley, who was nine years old at the time of filming, described it as a traumatic experience. &quot;[I]t definitely left me with a few scars... It was just so dangerous. There were so many explosions going off so close to me, which is traumatic for a kid whether it&#x27;s dangerous or not. Being in freezing cold water for long periods of time and working endless hours. It was physically grueling and unsafe.&quot; She further elaborated on her experience in her 2022 memoir, &quot;Run Towards the Danger&quot;, writing, &quot;Though [Gilliam] was magical and brilliant and made images and stories that will live for a long, long time, it&#x27;s hard to calculate whether they were worth the price of the hell that so many went through over the years to help him make them.&quot;

Nevertheless, on 29 October 2022, she tweeted, &quot;You have my unconditional permission to still love this movie&quot;, to people who were wondering whether they could &quot;still like this movie after hearing about [her] horrible experiences working on it as a child&quot;; adding in a second tweet, &quot;Yes, it was traumatic for me. Yes, it should have been handled very differently. Yes, it is still a great movie. The joy that comes from it is the joy I am able to carry with me as well as the terrible memories. So go nuts. Enjoy it. You have my blessing.&quot;

Production designer Dante Ferretti afterwards compared Gilliam to his former director, saying, &quot;Terry is very similar to Fellini in spirit. Fellini is a wilder liar, but that&#x27;s the only difference! Terry isn&#x27;t a director so much as a film author. He is open to every single idea and opportunity to make the end result work. Often the best ideas have come out of something not working properly and coming up with a new concept as a result. He is very elastic and that&#x27;s one quality in a director that I admire the most.&quot;

==Release==

When &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; was finally completed, David Puttnam, who had obtained the film&#x27;s US distribution rights for Columbia Pictures, had been replaced as CEO of Columbia; coupled with Gilliam&#x27;s prior quarrels with major studios over &quot;Brazil&quot;, the film was given limited distribution in the United States. The film opened on 8 December 1988 on 252 screens in West Germany and grossed $853,515 in its opening week, finishing third at the box office. It expanded to 317 screens the following week but saw a reduction in gross to $699,000, for a two week gross of $1.6 million. It grossed $8.1 million in the US and Canada, and £1,917,499 in the United Kingdom.

In &quot;Madness and Misadventures&quot;, Robin Williams commented on the low number of release prints that Columbia produced, saying, &quot;[Puttnam&#x27;s] regime was leaving, the new one was going through this, and they said, &#x27;This was &quot;their&quot; movie, now let&#x27;s do &quot;our&quot; movies!&#x27; It was a bit like the new lion that comes in and kills all the cubs from the previous man.&quot;

Regarding the contemporary press&#x27;s perception of the film being a financial disaster, Gilliam said in a 2000 interview with IGN, &quot;It seemed actually appropriate that Munchausen—the greatest liar in the world—should be a victim of some of the greatest liars in the world.&quot; He compared the film&#x27;s budget problems to the more serious problems of the film, &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot;; he went on to declare its difficulties as a mixture of &quot;trade press&quot; still being upset about his battle with Universal over &quot;Brazil&quot;, nepotism, and an intrigue on behalf of Ray Stark successfully trying to have Puttnam removed from Columbia, coupled with the fact the studio was being sold at the time:

The negative stories about the shoot that were turning up in the Hollywood press were coming, we found out later, from a source at Film Finances—which was the completion bond company on the film. Their lawyer was a guy named Steve Ransohoff, whose father was Martin Ransohoff—who was Ray Stark&#x27;s friend and partner. [...] I thought it was quite extraordinary, because the stories were doing two things—they were making me and the whole project look like it was completely out of control and all my fault, and that Film Finance, the completion guarantors, were the only thing holding it together—the people trying to bring control to it... the fact was, they were absolutely useless.

The ultimate fact was that when the film was ultimately released, there were only 117 prints made for America—so it was never really released. 117 prints! ...an art film gets 400. We were ultimately the victim of Columbia Tri-Star being sold to Sony, because at that time all they were doing was trying to get the books looking as good as possible. We weren&#x27;t the only film that suffered, but we were the most visible one. And what happened—to complete the story in a neat and tidy way—was that they were not spending any money on advertising to promote any of the movies started by the previous regime—by Putnam&#x27;s regime. They were burying films left right and center by spending no money on them—and the books looked really good at the end of that.

The joke is, if you look back, we got the best reviews and we were doing the best business in the opening weeks of any film they had released since &quot;Last Emperor&quot;. We actually opened well in the big cities—we opened really well. A friend who had bought the video rights said he had never seen anything so weird—Columbia was spending their whole time looking at exit polls to prove the film would not work in the suburbs, and so it would be pointless to make any more prints. He said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this.&quot; There it was. Then it becomes this kind of legend—which it deserves to be... even if it&#x27;s the wrong legend.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Bursting with Terry Gilliam&#x27;s typically imaginative flourishes, this story of a possibly deranged Baron recounting his storied life is a flamboyant and witty visual treat.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

Regarding the gap between the film&#x27;s troubled production and its eventual triumph of aesthetic cinematic form on the screen, Jeff Swindoll wrote in his 2008 DVD review of &quot;Munchausen&quot; for &quot;Monsters and Critics&quot;: &quot;For the absolute hell that the production of the film turned out to be, you really don&#x27;t see any of that tension on the screen... the film is a fantastic, whimsical treat... &quot;Baron Munchausen&quot; is full of whimsy, fantasy, bright colors, and fabulous characters. None is as fantastic as the Baron himself as played, with a twinkle in his eye, by the grand John Neville.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and found that it was &quot;told with a cheerfulness and a light touch that never betray the time and money it took to create them&quot;, appreciating &quot;the sly wit and satire that sneaks in here and there from director Terry Gilliam and his collaborators, who were mostly forged in the mill of Monty Python&quot;. While considering the film&#x27;s special effects as &quot;astonishing&quot;, Ebert also contended that &quot;the movie is slow to get off the ground&quot;, and &quot;sometimes the movie fails on the basic level of making itself clear. We&#x27;re not always sure who is who, how they are related, or why we should care.&quot; But &quot;allowing for the unsuccessful passages there is a lot here to treasure&quot;. Ebert concluded, &quot;This is a vast and commodious work... the wit and the spectacle of &quot;Baron Munchausen&quot; are considerable achievements.&quot; Additionally, he considered John Neville&#x27;s title role performance as appearing &quot;sensible and matter-of-fact, as anyone would if they had spent a lifetime growing accustomed to the incredible&quot;.

Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film a &quot;wondrous feat of imagination&quot;, although, &quot;except for Williams, the actors are never more than a detail in Gilliam&#x27;s compositions&quot;.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;Everything about &quot;Munchausen&quot; deserves exclamation points, and not just to clear the air of the odor of corporate flop sweat. So here it is! A lavish fairy tale for bright children of all ages! Proof that eccentric films can survive in today&#x27;s off-the-rack Hollywood! The most inventive fantasy since, well, &quot;Brazil!&quot; You may not believe it, ladies and gentlemen, but it&#x27;s all true.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;consistently imaginative&quot; and a &quot;spectacle [that] is indeed spectacular and worth the admission price and patches of boredom&quot;. He said that the &quot;major credit must go to Giuseppe Rotunno, the cameraman; Dante Ferretti, the production designer; Richard Conway, who did the special effects, and Peerless Camera Company Ltd., responsible for the optical effects. Without them, &quot;Baron Munchausen&quot; would have looked about as big and as interesting as a 25-cent postage stamp.&quot;

<text>Rudolf Erich Raspe (March 1736 – 16 November 1794) was a German librarian, writer, and scientist, called by his biographer John Patrick Carswell a &quot;rogue&quot;. He is best known for his collection of tall tales &quot;&quot;, also known as &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia&quot;, originally a satirical work with political aims.

==Life and work==
Raspe was born in Hanover, and baptised on 28 March 1736. He studied law and jurisprudence at Göttingen and Leipzig and worked as a librarian for the university of Göttingen. In 1762, he became a clerk in the university library at Hanover, and in 1764 secretary to the university library at Göttingen. He had become known as a versatile scholar and a student of natural history and antiquities, and he published some original poems and also translations of Ossian&#x27;s poems. In 1765 he published the first collection of Leibniz&#x27;s philosophical works. He also wrote a treatise on Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;.

In 1767, he was appointed professor in Cassel, and subsequently librarian. He contributed in 1769 a zoological paper to the 59th volume of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, which led to his being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and he wrote voluminously on all sorts of subjects. In 1774, he started a periodical called the &quot;Cassel Spectator&quot;. From 1767, he was responsible for some collections of Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). He had to flee to England in 1775 after having gone to Italy in 1775 to buy curios for the Landgrave. He was found to have sold the Landgrave&#x27;s valuables for his own profit. He was ejected from the Royal Society that same year for his &#x27;divers frauds and gross breaches of trust&#x27;.

In London, he employed his knowledge of English and his learning to secure a living by publishing and translating books on various subjects. Besides helping translate Georg Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot; into German, he also translated German works into English, and there are allusions to him as &quot;a Dutch savant&quot; in 1780 in the writings of Horace Walpole, who gave him money and helped him to publish an &quot;Essay on the Origin of Oil-painting&quot; (1781). But Raspe remained poor, and the Royal Society expunged his name from its list.

From 1782 to 1788, he was employed by Matthew Boulton as assay-master and storekeeper in the Dolcoath mine in Cornwall. At the same time, he also authored books in geology and the history of art.

The Trewhiddle Ingot, found in 2003, is a lump of tungsten found at Trewhiddle Farm and thought to be at least 150 years old. This may predate the earliest known smelting of the metal (which requires extremely high temperatures) and has led to speculation that it may have been produced during a visit by Raspe to Happy-Union mine (at nearby Pentewan) in the late eighteenth century. Raspe was also a chemist with a particular interest in tungsten. Memories of his ingenuity remained to the middle of the 19th century. While in Cornwall, he seems to have written the original version of Munchausen; whether he also wrote the several continuations that appeared until 1792 is still debated.
He also worked for the famous publisher John Nichols on several projects, among which was a descriptive catalogue he compiled of James Tassie&#x27;s collection of pastes and casts of gems, in two quarto volumes (1791) of laborious industry and bibliographical rarity. Raspe then went to Scotland, and in Caithness found a patron in Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster, whose mineralogical proclivities he proceeded to impose upon by pretending to discover valuable and workable veins on his estates. Raspe had &quot;salted&quot; the ground himself, and on the verge of exposure, he absconded. He finally moved to Ireland where he managed a copper mine on the Herbert Estate in Killarney. He died in Killarney, County Kerry, of typhoid, in November 1794.

The Baron Munchausen tales were made famous when they were &#x27;borrowed&#x27;, translated into German, and embellished somewhat by Gottfried August Bürger in 1786—and have been among the favourite reading of subsequent generations, as well as the basis of several films, including Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; inspired by the Karel Zeman (Czech director) movie &quot;The Fabulous Baron Munchausen&quot;, made twenty years before (&quot;Baron Prášil&quot; 1961). Others during Raspe&#x27;s lifetime were also aware of his authorship of the &quot;Adventures&quot;, including his friend John Hawkins, the geologist and traveller to Greece who mentions Raspe&#x27;s authorship in a letter to Charles Lyell. It was not till 1824 that the biographer of Bürger revealed the truth about the book.

Raspe&#x27;s dubious mining activities in Scotland provided the model for the character of Herman Dousterswivel, a German mining swindler in Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (1816), which was set in Scotland in the late 18th century. In a preface to the novel, Scott himself noted that the Dousterswivel character might seem &quot;forced and improbable&quot;, but wrote: &quot;... the reader may be assured that this part of the narrative is founded on a fact of actual occurrence.&quot;

<doc id="164508" wikidata="Q8727" url="?curid=164508" title="Liverpool John Lennon Airport">
<text>Liverpool John Lennon Airport is an international airport serving Liverpool, England, on the estuary of the River Mersey south-east of Liverpool city centre. Scheduled domestic, European, North African and Middle Eastern services are operated from the airport. The airport comprises a single passenger terminal, three general use hangars, a FedEx Express courier service centre as well as a single runway measuring in length, with the control tower south of the runway.

Originally called Speke Airport, it was operated by the Royal Air Force as RAF Speke in World War II. Between 1997 and 2007, annual passenger numbers increased from 689,468 to 5.47million. It was renamed after Liverpudlian musician John Lennon of The Beatles in 2001. The airport handled 4.19million passengers in 2023, making it the 12th-busiest airport in the UK.

==History==
===Imperial Airways===
Built in part of the grounds of Speke Hall, Liverpool (Speke) Airport, as the airport was originally known, started scheduled flights in 1930 with a service by Imperial Airways via Barton Aerodrome near Eccles, Salford and Castle Bromwich Aerodrome, Birmingham to Croydon Airport near London. The airport was officially opened on 1 July 1933. By the late 1930s, air traffic from Liverpool was beginning to take off with increasing demand for Irish Sea crossings, and a distinctive passenger terminal, control tower and two large aircraft hangars were built.

===Second World War===
At the beginning of 1937, Liverpool City Council leased between of their Speke Estate on a 999-year lease to the Air Ministry. The price included at all times the use of Speke Airport next to the shadow factory site. The LMS Railway provided a siding. Erection of the building was planned to take 30weeks and when complete it would provide employment for more than 5,000people. It was to be managed by Rootes Securities on behalf of the Air Ministry. Work started Monday 15 February 1937.

During the Second World War, Speke was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force and known as RAF Speke. Rootes built in a &quot;shadow factory&quot; by the airport to produce Bristol Blenheims and 1,070 Handley Page Halifax bombers. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation assembled many types of planes at the airport, including Hudsons and Mustang fighters, that had been shipped from the United States in parts to Liverpool Docks. The airport was also home to the Merchant Ship Fighter Unit.

On 8 October 1940 (one day before John Lennon&#x27;s birth), Speke was witness to what is thought to be the fastest air-to-air combat &quot;kill&quot; in the Battle of Britain and possibly of all time. Flight Lieutenant Denys Gillam took off in his Hawker Hurricane from Speke to be confronted by a Junkers Ju 88 passing across him. He shot the Junkers down while his undercarriage was still retracting, and, along with Alois Vašátko and Josef Stehlík, all of 312 Squadron, was credited with the kill. The moment has been caught in a painting by Robert Taylor called &quot;Fastest Victory&quot;.

===Civil airport===
Normal civil airline operations resumed after VE Day and passengers increased from 50,000 in 1945 to 75,000 in 1948, remaining ahead of Manchester Airport. Ownership by the Ministry of Aviation proved to be a drag on the airport&#x27;s progress thereafter, and Manchester gained the lead from 1949, resulting in Liverpool&#x27;s loss of the only ground-controlled radar approach unit available to North West airports, further hampering operation.

During the post-war years, Speke Airport hosted an annual air display in aid of the Soldiers, Sailors, and Air Force Association, a charity for veterans. The displays were immensely popular and attracted a huge crowd. On one such occasion on 21 May 1956, tragedy struck with the death of Léon Alfred Nicolas &quot;Léo&quot; Valentin, billed as the Birdman, when his balsa wood wings struck the opening of the aircraft from which he was exiting and he was hurtled into an uncontrollable spin. He attempted to deploy his emergency parachute, but it became entangled and &#x27;Roman candled&#x27;, leaving Leo to fall to his death. The local newspaper headlined the story with &quot;The world has been robbed of a daring personality.&quot; Ironically, a few years earlier Valentin had been attributed with discovering the free-fall stable position still used by sports parachutists today for safe deployment.

===New runway===
The city took over control of the airport on 1 January 1961 and prepared development plans. In 1966, a new runway was opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on a new site to the southeast of the existing airfield. It enabled the airport to be open for business around the clock and is in use to this day. Control of the airport transferred to Merseyside County Council from Liverpool Corporation in the mid-1970s and then, ten years later, to the five Merseyside councils following the abolition of Merseyside County Council. In 1982, Pope John Paul II visited and met crowds at the old Liverpool airport.

===Old terminal (1989)===

A modern passenger terminal adjacent to the new runway opened in 1986 followed by the closure of the original 1930s building.

The original terminal building dating from the late 1930s, famously seen on early television footage with its terraces packed with Beatles fans, was left derelict until converted into a hotel, opening in 2001, preserving its Grade II listed Art Deco style. It was part of the Marriott chain of hotels, but is currently the Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport Hotel after a renovation in August 2008. The former apron of the terminal is also listed and retained in its original condition, although it is no longer connected to the airport or subject to airside access control. It is the home of several aircraft, including BAe Jetstream 41 prototype G-JMAC and Bristol Britannia G-ANCF, preserved by the Speke Aerodrome Heritage Group. The two art-deco-style hangars that flank the terminal and apron have also been converted for new uses: one is now a David Lloyd leisure centre, the other the headquarters of the Very Group, called Skyways House.

In 1990, the airport was privatised, with British Aerospace taking a 76% shareholding in the new company. Subsequently, the airport has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Peel Holdings.

=== New terminal and renaming (2000) ===

In 2000, work on a £42.5million passenger terminal began, tripling its size and passenger capacity, completed in 2002 and opened by Queen Elizabeth II. There have since been further extensions to the airport terminal and airside.

In 2001, 21 years after his death, the airport was renamed in honour of The Beatles&#x27; John Lennon. A tall bronze statue stands overlooking the check-in hall. On the roof is painted the airport&#x27;s motto, &quot;Above us, only sky&quot;; a line from Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Imagine&quot;.

In 2005, the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, a large-scale work of art, was installed on a traffic island at the entrance to the airport. A permanent exhibition of photographs of The Beatles in India, taken by Paul Saltzman in 1968 at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, can be seen above the retail units in the departure lounge.

In 2005, a new apron was constructed exclusively for EasyJet, to the east of the terminal with six stands and a pier with six boarding gates.

In September 2006, reconstruction started on the main runway and taxiways. This was the first time the runway had been reconstructed (as opposed to resurfaced) since it was opened in 1966. This work was completed in 2007. In addition to runway and shoulder work was the upgrade of the 40-year-old airfield group lighting with a new system, intended to upgrade the runway to ILS Category III standards.

In May 2007, Flyglobespan commenced a seasonal flight to Hamilton, from Toronto. This was the Liverpool airport&#x27;s first transatlantic air service. Later that month, the carrier launched a route to New York City using a Boeing 757. Four of the seven weekly flights were nonstop, while the other three operated via Knock, Ireland. Yoko Ono, the widow of John Lennon, attended the inauguration ceremony. Several problems beset the service, including technical issues with the aircraft, lengthy delays and low passenger numbers. Flyglobespan ended up replacing the Boeing 757 with a smaller 737 due to the poor patronage. The company ended flights to both New York and Hamilton in October 2007.

In 2007, construction of a multi-level car park and a Hampton by Hilton hotel started. The hotel opened in October 2009. In June 2010, Vancouver Airport Services announced that it reached an agreement with The Peel Group to acquire 65% share in its airports, including Liverpool. In 2008, the airport hosted a public art exhibit. Liverpool 08 Collection, when Liverpool was the European Capital of Culture. Airside improvements include additional retail units and a more advanced security area aiming at reducing waiting times, completed in autumn 2010.

In April 2014, Peel repurchased the 65% stake it had sold in the airport giving it 100% ownership once more. In March 2016, Peel sold a 20% stake in the airport to Liverpool City Council for a reported £12M. This valued the airport at £60M. From 2019 to early 2020, the airport completed some renovation works which made it even easier to get around and also more aesthetically pleasing. This included changing the gate numbers from gates 30–43 to gates 11–17, in order to make the gates larger and more spacious, which also involved removing two by merging gates together. In addition, the departure hall, security hall and the entire experience throughout the airport has been altered massively by new decorations and images promoting the surrounding region.

, the airport is 47% owned by Peel, 47% by investment manager Ancala Partners, and 6% by Liverpool City Council.

=== Future expansion ===
Possible future developments include an investment of perhaps £100million in the airport infrastructure: this might include a runway extension (enabling transatlantic/long-haul flights) as well as a new cargo area south of the runway, new taxiway, terminal expansion (including new food/drink outlets, larger security areas as well as 3 new piers/concourses), hotel/parking expansion as well as the plans for a new A-road to enhance motorway connections to the facilities. In addition, the airport wants to build a nature reserve on the coastal perimeter of the Oglet Shore. Plans also include schemes to improve public transport connections to the airport, including new bus and rail services to South Parkway.

== Terminal ==
The single terminal at Liverpool John Lennon Airport has a capacity of 7million passengers a year and consists of an arrivals and a departures hall, both connected within short walking distance of each other. There are no jet bridges or travelators at Liverpool, requiring passengers to walk to/from the departure/arrival halls and gates. There are a number of retail and food outlets in the airport such as Boots, Burger King, Frankie &amp; Benny&#x27;s, Starbucks, WHSmith and a number of bars and cafés. There is also a World Duty Free retail section for departing passengers.

==Airport directors==
Captain Harold James Andrews was appointed as the first airport manager in July 1932, and he was effectively the first full-time professional co-ordinator for the whole project. Jack Chadwick took over many of the management functions post-war until 1961. That year there was a traffic increase of 42%, attributed to the first airport marketing campaign initiated by the new airport director, Wing Commander H.W.G.Andrews.

In the late 1960s, Brian Trunkfield was the assistant director, and Keith Porter took over as airport director in the days when The Beatles were regular passengers. Chris Preece, a former executive of British Aerospace, was airport director during much of the British Aerospace years of ownership, replaced by Rod Rufus and then Rod Hill, who brought in Direct Holidays, part of the MyTravel Group on a commercial deal which was to prove the market for easyJet. Neil Pakey took over as managing director in 2002, taking the airport through its major passenger growth years.

On selling the airport to Vancouver Airport Services in 2010, the former operations director for Vancouver Airport, Craig Richmond, took over, and on 1 March 2013, Matthew Thomas, also from Vancouver Airport Services (by then renamed Vantage Airport Group), was appointed to the role. Andrew Cornish held the CEO position from September 2014 until the end of June 2017. John Irving became the new CEO with effect from 12 March 2018.

The Hampton by Hilton Liverpool/John Lennon Airport is one of four Hilton Worldwide hotels in Liverpool. It is situated directly opposite the main terminal building, and is the second largest hotel serving the complex after the Crowne Plaza. The hotel was constructed as part of a £37million development by Peel Holdings at John Lennon Airport (which also included a multi-storey car park).

<doc id="164511" wikidata="Q904866" url="?curid=164511" title="Radio clock">
<text>A radio clock or radio-controlled clock (RCC), and often colloquially (and incorrectly) referred to as an &quot;atomic clock&quot;, is a type of quartz clock or watch that is automatically synchronized to a time code transmitted by a radio transmitter connected to a time standard such as an atomic clock. Such a clock may be synchronized to the time sent by a single transmitter, such as many national or regional time transmitters, or may use the multiple transmitters used by satellite navigation systems such as Global Positioning System. Such systems may be used to automatically set clocks or for any purpose where accurate time is needed. Radio clocks may include any feature available for a clock, such as alarm function, display of ambient temperature and humidity, broadcast radio reception, etc.

One common style of radio-controlled clock uses time signals transmitted by dedicated terrestrial longwave radio transmitters, which emit a time code that can be demodulated and displayed by the radio controlled clock. The radio controlled clock will contain an accurate time base oscillator to maintain timekeeping if the radio signal is momentarily unavailable. Other radio controlled clocks use the time signals transmitted by dedicated transmitters in the shortwave bands. Systems using dedicated time signal stations can achieve accuracy of a few tens of milliseconds.

GPS satellite receivers also internally generate accurate time information from the satellite signals. Dedicated GPS timing receivers are accurate to better than 1 microsecond; however, general-purpose or consumer grade GPS may have an offset of up to one second between the internally calculated time, which is much more accurate than 1 second, and the time displayed on the screen.

Other broadcast services may include timekeeping information of varying accuracy within their signals. Timepieces with Bluetooth radio support, ranging from watches with basic control of functionality via a mobile app to full smartwatches obtain time information from a connected phone, with no need to receive time signal broadcasts.

==Single transmitter==
Radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard, generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation. Some timekeepers, particularly watches such as some Casio Wave Ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling, can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions.

===Longwave and shortwave transmissions===
Radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations. The stations vary in broadcast frequency, in geographic location, and in how the signal is modulated to identify the current time. In general, each station has its own format for the time code.

==== List of radio time signal stations ====
Descriptions


Many other countries can receive these signals (JJY can sometimes be received in New Zealand, Western Australia, Tasmania, Southeast Asia, parts of Western Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America at night), but success depends on the time of day, atmospheric conditions, and interference from intervening buildings. Reception is generally better if the clock is placed near a window facing the transmitter. There is also a propagation delay of approximately for every the receiver is from the transmitter.

====Clock receivers====
A number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station, which, in turn, derives the time from a true atomic clock.

One of the first radio clocks was offered by Heathkit in late 1983. Their model GC-1000 &quot;Most Accurate Clock&quot; received shortwave time signals from radio station WWV in Fort Collins, Colorado. It automatically switched between WWV&#x27;s 5, 10, and 15 MHz frequencies to find the strongest signal as conditions changed through the day and year. It kept time during periods of poor reception with a quartz-crystal oscillator. This oscillator was disciplined, meaning that the microprocessor-based clock used the highly accurate time signal received from WWV to trim the crystal oscillator. The timekeeping between updates was thus considerably more accurate than the crystal alone could have achieved. Time down to the tenth of a second was shown on an LED display. The GC-1000 originally sold for US$250 in kit form and US$400 preassembled, and was considered impressive at the time. Heath Company was granted a patent for its design.

By 1990, engineers from German watchmaker Junghans had miniaturized this technology to fit into the case of a digital wristwatch. The following year the analog version Junghans MEGA with hands was launched. 

In the 2000s (decade) radio-based &quot;atomic clocks&quot; became common in retail stores; as of 2010 prices start at around US$15 in many countries. Clocks may have other features such as indoor thermometers and weather station functionality. These use signals transmitted by the appropriate transmitter for the country in which they are to be used. Depending upon signal strength they may require placement in a location with a relatively unobstructed path to the transmitter and need fair to good atmospheric conditions to successfully update the time. Inexpensive clocks keep track of the time between updates, or in their absence, with a non-disciplined quartz-crystal clock, with the accuracy typical of non-radio-controlled quartz timepieces. Some clocks include indicators to alert users to possible inaccuracy when synchronization has not been recently successful.

The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published guidelines recommending that radio clock movements keep time between synchronizations to within ±0.5 seconds to keep time correct when rounded to the nearest second. Some of these movements can keep time between synchronizations to within ±0.2 seconds by synchronizing more than once spread over a day.

Timepieces with Bluetooth radio support, ranging from watches with basic control of functionality via a mobile app to full smartwatches obtain time information from a connected phone, with no need to receive time signal broadcasts.

===Other broadcasts===
; Attached to other broadcast stations: Broadcast stations in many countries have carriers precisely synchronized to a standard phase and frequency, such as the BBC Radio 4 longwave service on 198 kHz, and some also transmit sub-audible or even inaudible time-code information, like the Radio France longwave transmitter on 162 kHz. Attached time signal systems generally use audible tones or phase modulation of the carrier wave.

; Teletext (TTX): Digital text pages embedded in television video also provide accurate time. Many modern TV sets and VCRs with TTX decoders can obtain accurate time from Teletext and set the internal clock. However, the TTX time can vary up to 5 minutes.

Many digital radio and digital television schemes also include provisions for time-code transmission.

; Digital Terrestrial Television : The DVB and ATSC standards have 2 packet types that send time and date information to the receiver. Digital television systems can equal GPS stratum 2 accuracy (with short term clock discipline) and stratum 1 (with long term clock discipline) provided the transmitter site (or network) supports that level of functionality.

; VHF FM Radio Data System (RDS): RDS can send a clock signal with sub-second precision but with an accuracy no greater than 100 ms and with no indication of clock stratum. Not all RDS networks or stations using RDS send accurate time signals. The time stamp format for this technology is Modified Julian Date (MJD) plus UTC hours, UTC minutes and a local time offset.

; L-band and VHF Digital Audio Broadcasting : DAB systems provide a time signal that has a precision equal to or better than Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) but like FM RDS do not indicate clock stratum. DAB systems can equal GPS stratum 2 accuracy (short term clock discipline) and stratum 1 (long term clock discipline) provided the transmitter site (or network) supports that level of functionality. The time stamp format for this technology is BCD.

; Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM): DRM is able to send a clock signal, but one not as precise as navigation satellite clock signals. DRM timestamps received via shortwave (or multiple hop mediumwave) can be up to 200 ms off due to path delay. The time stamp format for this technology is BCD.

==Multiple transmitters==
A radio clock receiver may combine multiple time sources to improve its accuracy. This is what is done in satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System, Galileo, and GLONASS. Satellite navigation systems have one or more caesium, rubidium or hydrogen maser atomic clocks on each satellite, referenced to a clock or clocks on the ground. Dedicated timing receivers can serve as local time standards, with a precision better than 50 ns. The recent revival and enhancement of LORAN, a land-based radio navigation system, will provide another multiple source time distribution system.

===GPS clocks===

Many modern radio clocks use satellite navigation systems such as Global Positioning System to provide more accurate time than can be obtained from terrestrial radio stations. These &quot;GPS clocks&quot; combine time estimates from multiple satellite atomic clocks with error estimates maintained by a network of ground stations. Due to effects inherent in radio propagation and ionospheric spread and delay, GPS timing requires averaging of these phenomena over several periods. No GPS receiver directly computes time or frequency, rather they use GPS to discipline an oscillator that may range from a quartz crystal in a low-end navigation receiver, through oven-controlled crystal oscillators (OCXO) in specialized units, to atomic oscillators (rubidium) in some receivers used for synchronization in telecommunications. For this reason, these devices are technically referred to as GPS-disciplined oscillators.

GPS units intended primarily for time measurement as opposed to navigation can be set to assume the antenna position is fixed. In this mode, the device will average its position fixes. After approximately a day of operation, it will know its position to within a few meters. Once it has averaged its position, it can determine accurate time even if it can pick up signals from only one or two satellites. 

GPS clocks provide the precise time needed for synchrophasor measurement of voltage and current on the commercial power grid to determine the health of the system.

===Astronomy timekeeping===
Although any satellite navigation receiver that is performing its primary navigational function must have an internal time reference accurate to a small fraction of a second, the displayed time is often not as precise as the internal clock. Most inexpensive navigation receivers have one CPU that is multitasking. The highest-priority task for the CPU is maintaining satellite lock—not updating the display. Multicore CPUs for navigation systems can only be found on high end products.

For serious precision timekeeping, a more specialized GPS device is needed. Some amateur astronomers, most notably those who time grazing lunar occultation events when the moon blocks the light from stars and planets, require the highest precision available for persons working outside large research institutions. The Web site of the International Occultation Timing Association has detailed technical information about precision timekeeping for the amateur astronomer.

==Daylight saving time==
Various formats listed above include a flag indicating the status of daylight saving time (DST) in the home country of the transmitter. This signal is typically used by clocks to adjust the displayed time to meet user expectations.

<doc id="164513" wikidata="Q713959" url="?curid=164513" title="Narcís Monturiol">
<text>Narcís Monturiol i Estarriol (; 28 September 1819 – 6 September 1885) was a Spanish inventor, artist and engineer born in Figueres, Spain. He was the inventor of the first air-independent and combustion-engine-driven submarine.

==Biography==
Monturiol i Estarriol was born in the city of Figueres, Spain. He was the son of a cooper. Monturiol went to high school in Cervera and got a law degree in Mostoles in 1845. He solved the fundamental problems of underwater navigation. In effect, Monturiol invented the first fully functional engine-driven submarine.

Monturiol never practiced law, instead turning his talents to writing and publishing, setting up a publishing company in 1846, the same year he married his wife Emilia. He produced a series of journals and pamphlets espousing his radical beliefs in feminism, pacifism, and utopian communism. He also founded the newspaper &quot;La Madre de Familia&quot;, in which he promised &quot;to defend women from the tyranny of men&quot; and &quot;La Fraternidad&quot;, Spain&#x27;s first communist newspaper.

Monturiol&#x27;s friendship with Abdó Terrades led him to join the Republican Party and his circle of friends included such names as musician Josep Anselm Clavé, and engineer and reformist Ildefons Cerdà. Monturiol also became an enthusiastic follower of the utopian thinker and socialist Étienne Cabet; he popularised Cabet&#x27;s ideas through &quot;La Fraternidad&quot; and produced a Spanish translation of his novel &quot;Voyage en Icarie&quot;. A circle formed round &quot;La Fraternidad&quot; raised enough money for one of them to travel to Cabet&#x27;s utopian community, Icaria.

Following the revolutions of 1848, one of his publications was suppressed by the government and he was forced into a brief exile in France. When he returned to Barcelona in 1849, the government curtailed his publishing activities, and he turned his attention to science and engineering instead.

A stay in Cadaqués allowed him to observe the dangerous job of coral harvesters where he even witnessed the death of a man who drowned while performing this job. This prompted him to think of submarine navigation and in September 1857 he went back to Barcelona and organized the first commercial society in Spain dedicated to the exploration of submarine navigation with the name of &quot;Monturiol, Font, Altadill y Cia.&quot; and a capital of 10,000 pesetas.

In 1858 Monturiol presented his project in a scientific thesis, titled &quot;The Ictineo&quot; (Fish-Ship). The first dive of his first submarine, &quot;Ictineo I&quot;, took place in September 1859 in the harbour of Barcelona.

=== &quot;Ictíneo I&quot; ===
&quot;Ictíneo I&quot; was long with a beam of and draft of . Her intended use was to ease the harvest of coral. &quot;Ictíneo I&quot;″s prow was equipped with a set of tools suited to the harvest of coral. During the summer of 1859, Monturiol performed more than 20 dives in &quot;Ictíneo I&quot;, with his business partner and shipbuilder as crew. &quot;Ictíneo I&quot; possessed good handling, but her top speed was disappointing, as it was limited by the power of human muscles.

&quot;Ictíneo I&quot; was eventually destroyed by accident in January 1862, after completing some fifty dives, when a cargo vessel ran into her at her berth. 

A modern replica of &quot;Ictíneo I&quot; stands in the garden entrance to the Marine Museum in Barcelona.

=== &quot;Ictíneo II&quot; ===
The &quot;Ictíneo II&quot; was originally intended as an improved version of the handpowered &quot;Ictíneo I&quot;. The Spanish Navy pledged support to Monturiol but did not actually supply it, so he had to raise funds himself, writing a letter to the nation to encourage a popular subscription which raised 300,000 pesetas from the people of Spain and Cuba and was used to form the company &quot;La Navegación Submarina&quot; to develop the &quot;Ictíneo II&quot;.

Monturiol&#x27;s ultimate plan envisaged a vessel custom-built to house his new engine, which would be entirely built of metal and with the engine housed in its own separate compartment. Due to the state of his finances, construction of the metal vessel was out of the question. Instead, he managed to assemble enough funds to fit the engine into the wooden &quot;Ictíneo II&quot; for preliminary tests and demonstrations.

On 22 October 1867, &quot;Ictíneo II&quot; made her first surface journey under steam power, averaging with a top speed of . On 14 December, Monturiol submerged the vessel and successfully tested his air-independent engine, without attempting to travel anywhere.

On 23 December that same year, Monturiol&#x27;s company went bankrupt and could attract no more investment. The chief creditor called in his debt, and Monturiol was forced to surrender his sole asset, &quot;Ictíneo II&quot;. The creditor subsequently sold her to a businessman, and the authorities, who taxed all ships, issued its new owner with a tax bill. Rather than pay the bill, he dismantled the submarine and sold it for scrap. A replica can be seen at the harbor of Barcelona.

==Later life and legacy==

===Later life===
In 1868 Monturiol returned to political life. A member of the &quot;Partido Federal&quot;, he was a deputy in the Constituent Assembly of the First Spanish Republic (1873), and shortly afterwards became the director of &quot;Fabrica Nacional del Timbre&quot; (&quot;National Stamp Factory&quot;) in Madrid for a few months, where he implemented a process to speed up the manufacturing of adhesive paper. Monturiol&#x27;s other inventions included a system for copying letters, a continuous printer, a rapid-firing cannon, a system to enhance the performance of steam generators, a stone cutter, a method for preserving meat, and a machine for making cigarettes.

Monturiol died in 1885, in Sant Martí de Provençals, now a suburb of Barcelona.

===Legacy===

No other submarine employed an anaerobic propulsion system until 1940 when the German Navy tested a system employing the same principles, the Walter turbine, on the experimental V-80 submarine and later on the Type XVII submarines. The problem of air-independent propulsion was finally resolved with the construction of the first nuclear powered submarine, the USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

Spain honored Monturiol on a postage stamp in 1987 (purportedly his death centennial; the reason for the discrepancy is unclear).

He has two monuments: one in Barcelona (Avinguda Diagonal-Carrer Girona) and other at the end of the &quot;Rambla&quot; in Figueres, his native city, better known for another &quot;Figuerenc&quot;, Salvador Dalí.

The Spanish Navy has honored his name giving it to what will be the first launched submarine of air independent propulsion in active service in the Spanish Navy, the S-82 Narciso Monturiol (the S-81 Isaac Peral being launched the last due to construction issues).

In 2013 a crewed submersible capable of reaching depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft) was named &quot;Ictineu 3&quot; honouring Monturiol&#x27;s inventions, &quot;Ictineo I&quot; and &quot;Ictineo II&quot;.

<text>Love and Kisses is a 1965 American comedy film starring Rick Nelson (formerly &quot;Ricky Nelson&quot;) as a young man who tries to grow up and emancipate himself from his middle-class parents by getting married. Based on the 1963 stage play of the same name by Anita Rowe Block, the film was written, produced and directed by Nelson&#x27;s father, Ozzie Nelson.

==Plot==
On the day he graduates from high school, Buzzy Pringle (Rick Nelson) secretly marries his girlfriend Rosemary (Kristin Nelson), whom he met at school and who still has to do another year because she has failed French. Buzzy&#x27;s family are horrified on hearing the news of their wedding, especially as Buzzy, unable to care for Rosemary, suggests that for the time being he and his wife live in his old room in the Pringles&#x27; suburban home. At first Buzzy&#x27;s parents suspect that Rosemary must be pregnant, but it soon turns out that neither of them has had sex before. It falls on Buzzy&#x27;s father (Jack Kelly) to have a man-to-man talk with his son on the latter&#x27;s wedding night and to tell him all there is to know about the birds and the bees.

The newlyweds&#x27; first marital crisis arises after only a few weeks when Rosemary, while her husband is away doing a summer job at the company his father works for, attempts to be a housewife but in fact lacks the necessary skills. The situation escalates when Buzzy finds out that it is his father rather than the company who is paying him. His confidence is temporarily shattered, but Buzzy quickly recovers and eventually is able to make some important decisions. He finds a real job and rents a small apartment and in the end is reunited with Rosemary.

==Cast==
* Rick Nelson as Buzzy Pringle
* Jack Kelly as Jeff Pringle
* Kristin Nelson as Rosemary Cotts
* Jerry Van Dyke as Freddy
* Pert Kelton as Nanny
* Howard McNear as Mr. Frisby
* Barry Livingston as Bobby
* Alvy Moore as Officer Jones
* Madelyn Himes as Carol Pringle
* Sheilah Wells as Elizabeth Pringle
* Ivan Bonar as Assemblyman Potter

==Production notes==
Ozzie Nelson bought the rights to Anita Rowe Block&#x27;s 1963 stage play &quot;Love and Kisses&quot;, with the intention of adapting it for the screen as a vehicle for his son Rick. He then made a deal with Universal Pictures to write, produce and direct the feature. Nelson also cast Rick&#x27;s then-wife Kristin as the love interest (Kristen also appeared as Rick&#x27;s wife after they married in 1963 on &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;).

Singer-songwriter Sonny Curtis was hired to write two songs for the film, &quot;Love and Kisses&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; with Kristen Nelson in mind. Rick Nelson recorded the songs which were released as a single. To promote the film and the songs, Nelson performed them on the television series &quot;Shindig!&quot; on November 13, 1965.

<doc id="164518" wikidata="Q685345" url="?curid=164518" title="Live at Leeds">
<text>Live at Leeds is the first live album by the English rock band the Who, recorded at the University of Leeds Refectory on 14 February 1970 and released on 11 May 1970, by Decca and MCA in the United States and by Track and Polydor in the United Kingdom. It is the band&#x27;s only live album that was recorded with the classic line-up of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon.

The Who were looking for a way to follow up their 1969 album &quot;Tommy&quot;, and had recorded several shows on tours supporting that album, but disliked the sound. Consequently, they booked the show at Leeds University, along with one at Hull City Hall the following day, specifically to record a live album. Six songs were taken from the Leeds show, and the cover was pressed to look like a bootleg recording. The sound was significantly different from &quot;Tommy&quot; and featured hard rock arrangements that were typical of the band&#x27;s live shows. &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; has been reissued on several occasions and in several different formats. Since its release, it has been ranked by several music critics as one the greatest live albums and rock recordings of all time.

==Background==
By the end of the 1960s, particularly after releasing &quot;Tommy&quot; in May 1969, The Who had become cited by many as one of the best live rock acts in the world. According to biographer Chris Charlesworth, &quot;a sixth sense seemed to take over&quot;, leading them to &quot;a kind of rock nirvana that most bands can only dream about&quot;. The band were rehearsing and touring regularly, and Townshend had settled on using the Gibson SG Special as his main stage instrument; its lightweight and thin body allowed him to play faster than other guitars. He began using Hiwatt amplifiers that allowed him to get a variety of tones simply by adjusting the guitar&#x27;s volume level.

The group were concerned that &quot;Tommy&quot; had been promoted as &quot;high art&quot; by manager Kit Lambert and thought their stage show stood in equal importance to that album&#x27;s rock-opera format. The group returned to England at the end of 1969 with a desire to release a live album from concerts recorded earlier in the US. However, Townshend balked at the prospect of listening to all the accumulated recordings to decide which would make the best album, and, according to Charlesworth, instructed sound engineer Bob Pridden to burn the tapes, an order Townshend retrospectively called &quot;one of the stupidest decisions of my life.&quot;

Two shows were consequently scheduled, one at the University of Leeds and the other in Hull, for the express purpose of recording and releasing a live album. The Leeds concert was booked and arranged by Simon Brogan, who later became an assistant manager on tour with Jethro Tull. The shows were performed on 14 February 1970 at Leeds and on 15 February at Hull, but technical problems with the recordings from the Hull gig — the bass guitar had not been recorded on some of the songs — made it all the more necessary for the show from the 14th to be released as the album. Townshend subsequently mixed the live tapes, intending to release a double album, but then decided on a single album with six tracks. The full show opened with Entwistle&#x27;s &quot;Heaven And Hell&quot; and included most of &quot;Tommy&quot;, but these were left off the album in place of earlier hits and more obscure material. According to David Hepworth, because there was no microphone pointed towards the audience, crowd noise was a &quot;distant presence, as distant as the traffic outside,&quot; making the recording &quot;a faithful account of what the band played and nothing more.&quot;

==Songs==

The album opens with &quot;Young Man Blues&quot;, an R&amp;B tune that was a standard part of the Who&#x27;s stage repertoire at the time. It was extended to include an instrumental jam with stop-start sections. &quot;Substitute&quot;, a 1966 single for the band, was played similarly to the studio version. &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; was rearranged to include power chords, a key change, and Entwistle singing the authority figure lines (e.g.: &quot;Like to help you son, but you&#x27;re too young to vote&quot;) in a deep-bass voice. &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; was arranged similar to the original, but the chorus line was slowed down for effect, and there was a jam session in the middle.

Side two begins with a 15-minute rendition of &quot;My Generation&quot;, which was greatly extended to include a medley of other songs and various improvisations. These include a brief extract of &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot; and the ending of &quot;Sparks&quot; from &quot;Tommy&quot;, and part of &quot;Naked Eye&quot; that was recorded for the follow-up album &quot;Lifehouse&quot; (which was ultimately abandoned in favour of &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;). The album closes with &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, which included Daltrey playing harmonica and an extended ending to the song.

==Release==
The original LP was released on 11 May 1970. The cover was designed by Graphreaks with the rubber stamp logo created by Beadrall Sutcliffe. It resembled that of a bootleg LP of the era, parodying the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Live&#x27;r Than You&#x27;ll Ever Be&quot;. It contains plain brown cardboard with &quot;The Who Live at Leeds&quot; printed on it in plain blue or red block letters as if stamped on with ink (on the original first English pressing of 300, this stamp is black). The original cover opened out, gatefold-style, and had a pocket on either side of the interior, with the record in a paper sleeve on one side and 12 facsimiles of various memorabilia on the other, including a photo of the band from the &quot;My Generation&quot; photoshoot in March 1965, handwritten lyrics to the &quot;Listening to You&quot; chorus from &quot;Tommy&quot;, the typewritten lyrics to &quot;My Generation&quot;, with hand written notes, a receipt for smoke bombs, a rejection letter from EMI, and the early black &quot;Maximum R&amp;B&quot; poster showing Pete Townshend wind-milling his Rickenbacker. The first pressing included a copy of the contract for The Who to play at the Woodstock Festival.

The label was handwritten and included instructions to the engineers not to attempt to remove any crackling noise. This is probably a reference to the clicking and popping on the pre-remastered version (such as in &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot;). Modern digital remastering techniques allowed this to be removed, and also allowed some of the worst-affected tracks from the gig to be used; on CD releases, the label reads, &quot;Crackling noises have been corrected!&quot;

===Reissues===
The album was reissued on CD in 1995. It included most of the Leeds concert, missing most of the performance of &quot;Tommy&quot; except for one song. A further expanded edition of the album was released in 2001, this time with the complete concert, although not in the original running order.

For the 40th anniversary of the concert, a box set was released with the complete show at Leeds, and at Hull the following day. Part of the bass track from the Hull show was missing from the master tape, which was replaced with the performance from the Leeds gig where necessary. In 2017, the album was reissued on heavyweight vinyl, with a replica of the original 1970 LP&#x27;s packaging.

== Critical reception ==
In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, music critic Nik Cohn praised &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; as &quot;the definitive hard-rock holocaust&quot; and &quot;the best live rock album ever made&quot;. Jonathan Eisen of &quot;Circus&quot; magazine felt that it flowed better than &quot;Tommy&quot; and that not since that album had there been one &quot;quite so incredibly heavy, so inspired with the kind of kinetic energy that The Who have managed to harness here.&quot; Greil Marcus, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, was less enthusiastic and said that, while Townshend&#x27;s packaging for the album was &quot;a tour-de-force of the rock and roll imagination&quot;, the music was dated and uneventful. He felt that &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; functioned simply as a document of &quot;the formal commercial end of the first great stage of [The Who&#x27;s] great career.&quot;

In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau asserted that, although side one was valuable for the live covers and &quot;Substitute&quot;, &quot;My Generation&quot; and the &quot;uncool-at-any-length&quot; &quot;Magic Bus&quot; were not an improvement over their &quot;raw&quot; album versions. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Bruce Eder felt that the album was seen as a model of excellence for live rock and roll during the 1970s; that it was The Who&#x27;s best up to that point, and that there was &quot;certainly no better record of how this band was a volcano of violence on-stage, teetering on the edge of chaos but never blowing apart.&quot; In a review of its 1995 CD reissue, Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; asserted that it showed why The Who were important: &quot;Few bands ever moved a mountain of sound around with this much dexterity and power.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;the future for rock as it became, in all its pomp and circumstance, began right here.&quot; Steven Hyden, writing for PopMatters, said that it was &quot;not only the best live rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll album ever, but the best rock album period.&quot; Roy Carr of &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, reviewing the 2010 reissue, remarked how the new Live at Hull section &quot;is noticeably more tight, more focused and even more aggressive&quot; than the original recording, concluding that &quot;we now have the two greatest live rock albums...ever.&quot;

Who biographer Dave Marsh has praised the album as &quot;so molten with energy at times it resembles the heavy metal of Deep Purple and the atomic blues of Led Zeppelin ... absolutely non-stop hard rock&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Live at Leeds&quot; has been cited as the best live rock recording of all time by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, the BBC, &quot;Q&quot; magazine, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2003, it was ranked number 170 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and dropping to number 327 in 2020. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll in 2012 ranked it the best live album of all time. It was ranked number 356 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

A commemorative blue plaque has been placed at the campus at which it was recorded, the University of Leeds Refectory. On 17 June 2006, over 36 years after the original concert, The Who returned to perform at the Refectory, at a gig organised by Andy Kershaw. Kershaw hailed it as &quot;among the most magnificent I have ever seen&quot;.

&quot;Even today, &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; sounds so alive,&quot; remarked Rush bassist Geddy Lee. &quot;It&#x27;s a real piece of that period of rock. It&#x27;s like a bootleg: the artwork, the tone… It was raw.&quot;

<text>Bismark is a town in the Stendal district, in the historic Altmark region, which is located in the northern part of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is situated approximately west of Stendal in north-eastern Germany.

In the early 12th century, the area then under the rule of Albert the Bear was settled with peasants migrating from the Low Countries. The town&#x27;s name is derived from the nearby river Biese (after meaning &quot;rush plants&quot;); though it may also refer to the &quot;bishop&#x27;s march&quot;, a possession of the Havelberg bishops mentioned in a 1209 deed issued by the Ascanian margrave Albert II. With the Altmark, Bismark was part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg until it was adjudicated to the Prussian Province of Saxony after the 1815 Congress of Vienna.

One Herbordus of Bismarck was mentioned holding the office of a &quot;Schultheiß&quot; in Stendal about 1270. His descendant Otto von Bismarck received the honorary citizenship of Bismark in 1895.

At an administrative reform that became effective on 1 January 2010, the town of Bismark absorbed the former municipalities of Badingen, Berkau, Büste, Dobberkau, Garlipp, Grassau, Hohenwulsch, Holzhausen, Käthen, Kläden, Könnigde, Kremkau, Meßdorf, Querstedt, Schäplitz, Schernikau, Schorstedt and Steinfeld. Schinne was absorbed on 1 September 2010. These 19 former municipalities and Bismark proper, that had previously co-operated in the &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; Bismark/Kläden, now form the 20 &quot;Ortschaften&quot; (municipal divisions) of the town.

==Notable persons==
* Elise Hampel, born Lemme (1903-1943); resistance fighter, executed on April 8, 1943 with her husband Otto Hampel in Berlin-Plötzensee.

<text>Jam sync refers to the practice of applying a phase hit to a system to bring it in synchronization with another.

<text>Uckermark () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northeastern part of Brandenburg, Germany. Neighbouring districts are (clockwise from the south) Barnim and Oberhavel, the districts Mecklenburgische Seenplatte and Vorpommern-Greifswald in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and to the east Poland (Police County and Gryfino County). It is one of the largest districts of Germany areawise. The district is named after the historical region of Uckermark.

==Geography==
The Uckermark is named after the Uecker river. The Oder River, forming the Polish border, bounds the district in the east. The district is characterised by 600 lakes and 2,800 km of rivers. Rare animals still live in the lakeland, such as ospreys, beavers and otters.

The western parts of the Lower Oder Valley National Park are located in the district.

==History==

The Uckermark was originally divided between the administrative units &quot;Uckerkreis&quot; and &quot;Stolpirischer Kreis&quot;. In 1817 as part of the Province of Brandenburg, a third district was created in the area, the district Angermünde, and the other two districts were renamed to Prenzlau and Templin. The current district Uckermark was created in 1993 by merging the previous districts Angermünde, Prenzlau and Templin, as well as the previously district-free city Schwedt. The district encompasses a small part of historical Western Pomerania, namely the area of Amt Gartz (Oder), while on the other hand, a part of the historical Uckermark around Löcknitz is currently included in the Vorpommern-Greifswald District.

== Demography ==


==Coat of arms==
The main feature of the coat of arms are the brick buildings of the district — the churches of Prenzlau and Angermünde. The city wall below recalls the many wars of the Middle Ages. The two circular windows in the church tower symbolizes the division into two districts before the reform of 1817, the three Gothic windows represent this division. On the city wall are two shields — one with the griffin of Pomerania, the other with the red eagle of Brandenburg. The wavy lines in the upper part represent the main rivers in the district, Oder, Randow, and Uecker. The yellow color of the background represents the agriculture of the district, as the Uckermark was the &quot;granary&quot; of Brandenburg. The coat of arms was created by Hans Benthin, and was officially granted on November 8, 1995.

<text>An aviation accident is an event during aircraft operation that causes serious injury, death, or destruction. An aviation incident is any operating event that compromises safety but does not progress to an aviation accident. Preventing accidents and incidents is the main goal of aviation safety.

One of the earliest recorded aviation accidents occurred on May 10, 1785, when a hot air balloon crashed in the town of Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland. The town was seriously damaged from the resultant fire that burned down over 130 homes. The first involving a powered aircraft was the crash of a Wright Model A aircraft at Fort Myer, Virginia, in the United States on September 17, 1908, injuring its co-inventor and pilot, Orville Wright, and killing the passenger, Signal Corps lieutenant Thomas Selfridge.

== Definitions ==

The Convention on International Civil Aviation Annex 13 formally defines an &quot;aviation accident&quot; as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft, which takes place from the time any person boards the aircraft with the &quot;intention of flight&quot; until all such persons have disembarked, and in which (a) a person is fatally or seriously injured, (b) the aircraft sustains significant damage or structural failure, or (c) the aircraft goes missing or becomes completely inaccessible. Annex 13 defines an &quot;aviation incident&quot; as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operation.

A &quot;hull loss&quot; occurs if an aircraft is damaged beyond repair, is lost, or becomes completely inaccessible.

== History ==
The first aircraft accident in which 200 or more people died occurred on March 3, 1974, when 346 died in the crash of Turkish Airlines Flight 981. , there have been a total of 33 aviation incidents in which 200 or more people have died.


The period from 1958 to 1968 saw tremendous growth in aviation. Improvements in aviation safety and accident investigation procedures were rapidly advancing. In 1963, the Civil Aeronautics Board, under the leadership of then Deputy Director Bobbie R. Allen, established the National Aircraft Accident Investigation School in Oklahoma City.

The ICAO&#x27;s third accident investigation division meeting, held in Montreal, Canada in January 1965, laid the foundation for accident investigations throughout the world. The proposals were presented by the Director of the Civil Aeronautics Board Bureau of Safety, Bobbie R. Allen, who headed the U.S. delegation. The U.S. formally adopted the proposals at the White House on December 1, 1965.

The top 10 countries with the highest number of fatal civil airliner accidents from 1945 to 2021 are the United States, Russia, Canada, Brazil, Colombia, United Kingdom, France, Indonesia, Mexico, and India. The United Kingdom is noted to have the highest number of air crashes in Europe, with a total of 110 air crashes within the time period, and Indonesia is the highest in Asia at 104, followed by India at 95.

The most fatalities on board a single aircraft are the 520 fatalities of the 1985 Japan Air Lines Flight 123 accident. The largest loss of life in a single aviation accident are the 583 fatalities of the 1977 Tenerife airport disaster, in which two Boeing 747s collided. The largest loss of life overall in a collective incident are the 2,996 fatalities in the coordinated terrorist destruction of airplanes and occupied buildings in the 2001 September 11 attacks, the first plane to be hijacked and crashed as part of the attack, American Airlines Flight 11, was alone responsible for an estimated 1,700 fatalities in total, making it the single deadliest aviation disaster in history.

=== September 11 attacks ===
2,996: The deadliest aviation-related disaster regarding fatalities both on board the aircraft and casualties on the ground, was the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001. On that morning, four commercial jet airliners traveling on transcontinental flights from East Coast airports to California were hijacked after takeoff. The four hijacked aircraft were subsequently crashed in a series of four coordinated suicide attacks against major American landmarks by 19 Islamist terrorists affiliated with Al-Qaeda. American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both regularly scheduled domestic transcontinental flights from Boston to Los Angeles, were hijacked by five men each, with the assigned pilot hijacker taking control of the flight, before being intentionally crashed into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center, respectively, destroying both buildings in less than two hours. The World Trade Center crashes killed 2,753, as both planes were carrying a combined total of 157 occupants, the vast majority of fatalities were the occupants of the two towers and the emergency personnel responding to the disaster. In addition, 184 were killed by the impact of American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, causing severe damage and partial destruction to the building&#x27;s west side. The crash of United Airlines Flight 93 into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, which occurred as passengers attempted to retake control of the aircraft from the hijackers, killed all 40 passengers and crew aboard the aircraft. This brought the total number of casualties of the September 11 attacks to 2,996 (including the 19 terrorist hijackers). As deliberate terrorist acts, the 9/11 crashes were not classified as accidents, but as mass-killing. The events were treated by the member nations of NATO as an act of war and terrorism. The war on terror was subsequently launched by NATO in response to the attacks, eventually leading to the death of Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks.

=== Tenerife disaster ===
583: The Tenerife airport disaster on March 27, 1977, remains the accident with the highest number of airliner passenger fatalities. 583 people died when a KLM Boeing 747 attempted to take off and collided with a taxiing Pan Am 747 at Los Rodeos Airport on the Canary Island of Tenerife, Spain. All 234 passengers and 14 crew of the KLM aircraft died and 335 of the 396 passengers and crew of the Pan Am aircraft died. Pilot error was the primary cause, as the KLM captain began his takeoff run in the mistaken belief he had obtained air traffic control clearance. Other contributing factors were a terrorist incident at Gran Canaria Airport that had caused many flights to be diverted to Los Rodeos, a small airport not well equipped to handle aircraft of such size, dense fog, poor radio phraseology, and controller distraction. The KLM flight crew could not see the Pan Am aircraft on the runway until immediately before the collision. The accident had a lasting influence on the industry, particularly in the area of communication. An increased emphasis was placed on using standardized phraseology in air traffic control (ATC) communication by both controllers and pilots alike. &quot;Cockpit Resource Management&quot; has also been incorporated into flight crew training. The captain is no longer considered infallible, and combined crew input is encouraged during aircraft operations.

=== Japan Air Lines Flight 123 ===
520: The crash of Japan Air Lines Flight 123 on August 12, 1985, has the highest number of fatalities for any single-aircraft accident: 520 people died aboard a Boeing 747. The aircraft suffered an explosive decompression from an incorrectly repaired aft pressure bulkhead, which failed in mid-flight, destroying most of its vertical stabilizer and severing all of the hydraulic lines, making the 747 virtually uncontrollable. Pilots were able to keep the plane flying for 32 minutes after the mechanical failure before crashing into a mountain. All 15 crew members and 505 of the 509 passengers aboard died. Japanese military personnel inaccurately assumed, during a helicopter flyover of the impact site, that there were no survivors. Rescue operations were delayed until the following morning. Medical providers involved in rescue and analysis operations determined that several passengers likely survived the impact and probably would have survived the incident had rescue operations not been delayed. Four passengers survived the incident in its entirety, meaning that they were alive when discharged from the hospital.

=== Other crashes with death tolls of 200 or more ===
349: On November 12, 1996, Saudia Flight 763, operated by a Boeing 747, and Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907, operated by a Russian Ilyushin Il-76, collided mid-air over the town of Charkhi Dadri, near Delhi, India. The collision was mainly the result of the Kazakh pilot flying lower than the assigned clearance altitude. All 349 occupants on-board the two aircraft died. It remains the world&#x27;s deadliest mid-air collision without survivors. The Ramesh Chandra Lahoti Commission, empowered to study the causes, recommended the creation of the &quot;semi-circular rule&quot;, to prevent aircraft from flying in opposite directions at the same altitude. The Civil Aviation Authorities in India made it mandatory for all aircraft flying in and out of India to be equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), setting a worldwide precedent for mandatory use of TCAS.

346: On March 3, 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 981, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, crashed in a forest northeast of Paris, France. The London-bound aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Orly airport; all 346 people aboard died. It was later determined that the cargo door detached, which caused an explosive decompression; this caused the floor just above to collapse. The collapsed floor severed the control cables, which left the pilots without control of the elevators, the rudder and No. 2 engine. The aircraft entered a steep dive and crashed. It was the deadliest plane crash of all time until the Tenerife disaster in 1977. However, it is currently the deadliest single-aircraft crash with no survivors. This accident was also the deadliest single-aircraft crash that did not involve a Boeing 747.

329: On June 23, 1985, Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747-237B en route from Toronto and Montreal to London and Delhi, crashed off the southwest coast of Ireland when a bomb exploded in the cargo hold. All 307 passengers and 22 crew members died. One passenger had checked in as &quot;M. Singh&quot;. Singh did not board the flight but his suitcase, containing the bomb, was loaded onto the aircraft. &quot;M. Singh&quot; was never identified or captured. It was later determined Sikh extremists were behind the bombing as a retaliation for the Indian government&#x27;s attack on the Golden Temple in the city of Amritsar, spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. This was, at the time, the deadliest terrorist attack involving an airplane.

301: On August 19, 1980, Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 163, a Lockheed L-1011, became the world&#x27;s deadliest aviation accident that did not involve a crash. The crew performed an emergency landing at Riyadh after a fire broke out in an aft baggage compartment. The fire burned through the ceiling of the compartment and into the passenger cabin. While the crew managed to land the aircraft safely, the captain did not stop immediately and order an evacuation. He taxied off the runway instead, by which time everyone in the cabin had become unconscious due to fumes and were unable to open any doors or evacuate. All 301 passengers and crew aboard died of suffocation before rescue ground crews could open any door, after which the aircraft burst into flames and was consumed by fire.

298: On July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a Boeing 777-200ER, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down in an area of Eastern Ukraine near the Ukraine/Russian border during the war in Donbas. There were 298 people on board: 283 passengers and 15 crew members, all of whom died. The crew were all Malaysians, while the passengers were of various nationalities, most from the Netherlands. Several Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) aircraft had been shot down over the rebel-controlled territory before the MH17 incident. Immediately after the crash, a post appeared on the VKontakte social media profile attributed to Igor Girkin, leader of the Donbas separatist militia, claiming responsibility for shooting down a Ukrainian An-26 military transport near Torez. The post was removed later the same day, and the separatists then denied shooting down any aircraft.

290: On July 3, 1988, Iran Air Flight 655, an Iranian civilian Airbus A300-200 airliner, was shot down by two surface-to-air missiles from the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; over the Strait of Hormuz. All 290 passengers and crew aboard the aircraft died. The downing was caused by a series of mistakes that led the USS Vincennes crew to believe that the airliner was an Iranian Air Force F-14.

275: On February 19, 2003, an Iranian military Ilyushin Il-76 crashed in mountainous terrain near Kerman in Iran. The official report says bad weather brought the aircraft down; high winds and fog were present at the time of the crash.

273: On May 25, 1979, American Airlines Flight 191, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, crashed shortly after lifting off the runway at Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport after the number one (left) engine and pylon separated from the wing. This broke hydraulic lines, causing leading edge lift devices to retract on that side of the aircraft and resulted in asymmetrical lift and loss of control. The accident was attributed to improper maintenance procedures. The crash resulted in the deaths of all 271 passengers and crew on board, as well as two people on the ground. It remains the deadliest commercial aircraft accident in United States history, and was also the country&#x27;s deadliest aviation disaster until the September 11 attacks in 2001.

270: On December 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747-121 bound for New York–JFK from London–Heathrow with continued service to Detroit, was destroyed by a terrorist bomb over the town of Lockerbie, Scotland. All 259 occupants and 11 people on the ground (all residents of Sherwood Crescent, Lockerbie), died,
making it the worst terrorist attack involving an aircraft in the UK and the deadliest terrorist attack on British soil. Following the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed new security measures on American airlines flying out of 103 airports in Western Europe and the Middle East.

269: On September 1, 1983, a Soviet interceptor Sukhoi Su-15 shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, a Boeing 747-230B, bound for Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, South Korea, after it flew into Soviet airspace; all 269 occupants on board died.

265: On November 12, 2001, American Airlines Flight 587, an Airbus A300, crashed in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, New York, just after departing John F. Kennedy International Airport bound for Las Américas International Airport, Santo Domingo. The first officer&#x27;s overuse of the rudder in response to wake turbulence from a Japan Airlines 747 was cited as cause. All 260 people on board, as well as five people on the ground, died from the crash. It is the second-deadliest aviation accident on U.S. soil, after American Airlines Flight 191.

264: On April 26, 1994, China Airlines Flight 140 was completing a routine flight and approach at Nagoya Airport, Japan, when the Airbus A300B4-622R&#x27;s First Officer inadvertently pressed the takeoff/go-around button, which raises the throttle position to the same as that for take offs and go-arounds. The action and the two pilots&#x27; reaction resulted in a crash that killed 264 (15 crew and 249 passengers) of the 271 people aboard.

261: On July 11, 1991, Nigeria Airways Flight 2120, a Douglas DC-8-61 aircraft operated by Nationair Canada, crashed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after two tires ignited upon takeoff, leading to an in-flight fire. All 261 occupants were killed. It is the deadliest aviation accident involving a DC-8, the largest aviation disaster involving a Canadian-registered aircraft and the second-worst accident in Saudi Arabia (after Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 163see above).

257: On April 11, 2018, an Algerian Air Force transport aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from Boufarik Airport, killing all 257 occupants on board the Ilyushin Il-76.

257: On November 28, 1979, Air New Zealand Flight 901, an Antarctic sightseeing flight, collided with Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica, killing all 257 occupants on board. The flight crew had not been informed that the computer coordinates for the flight path of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 had been changed the night before, directing the flight directly into Mount Erebus rather than the usual path down McMurdo Sound.

256: On December 12, 1985, a Douglas DC-8, Arrow Air Flight 1285R, carrying American military personnel on a charter flight home for Christmas, crashed in Newfoundland; all 256 occupants on board died. The Canadian Aviation Safety Board investigating the cause of the crash issued two different reports: the majority report cited ice on the wings as cause of the crash; the minority report suggests an explosion was the likely cause. This has been the deadliest aviation incident in Canadian history. 

239: On March 8, 2014, a Boeing 777-200ER, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China, lost contact with air traffic controllers over the South China Sea, deviated from its planned route, and was presumed lost in the southern Indian Ocean. It carried 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 15 nations, who are all presumed dead. A multinational search effort, the most extensive and expensive in aviation history, has thus far failed to locate the aircraft, though debris from the aircraft has been recovered from beaches around the Indian Ocean. Numerous theories have been offered to explain the disappearance of the flight, but none have been confirmed.

234: On September 26, 1997, an Airbus A300B4-220, Garuda Indonesia Flight 152, which departed from Jakarta, Indonesia, and was preparing to land at Medan, North Sumatra, crashed into mountainous terrain, killing all 234 occupants on board. The causes included turning left instead of right as instructed by ATC and descending below the assigned altitude of 2,000 feet due to pilot error. It is the deadliest aviation disaster in Indonesia&#x27;s history.

230: On July 17, 1996, a Boeing 747-131, TWA Flight 800, carrying 230 occupants, exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, shortly after departing from John F. Kennedy International Airport on a flight to Paris and Rome. A lengthy investigation concluded that the probable cause of the accident was a short circuit in a fuel tank that contained an explosive mixture of fuel vapor and air. As a result, new requirements were developed to prevent future fuel tank explosions in aircraft.

229: On September 2, 1998, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, Swissair Flight 111, carrying 215 passengers and 14 crew from New York City to Geneva, Switzerland, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, killing all 229 people aboard. After a lengthy investigation, an official report stated that flammable material used in the aircraft&#x27;s structure, specifically the Personal TV Systems recently installed in the Business Class Cabin, allowed a fire to spread, resulting in a loss of control.

228: On June 1, 2009, an Airbus A330-203, Air France Flight 447, carrying 228 occupants, was en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Paris, France, when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft&#x27;s flight recorders were not recovered from the ocean floor until May 2011, and the final investigative report was released in July 2012. It determined that the disaster was likely due to the aircraft&#x27;s pitot tubes being obstructed by ice crystals, causing the autopilot to disconnect. The crew reacted incorrectly, leading to an aerodynamic stall from which the jet did not recover.

228: On August 6, 1997, a Boeing 747-3B5, Korean Air Flight 801, crashed on approach to the international airport in the United States territory of Guam, killing 228 of the 254 people aboard. Contributing factors in the crash were fatigue and errors by the flight crew, inadequate flight crew training, and a modification of the airport&#x27;s altitude warning system that prevented it from detecting aircraft below a minimum safe altitude.

227: On January 8, 1996, an Antonov An-32B aircraft with six crew members on board overshot the runway at N&#x27;Dolo Airport, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, and crashed into a market place. Four on board survived but 225 people on the ground were killed and an estimated 500 were injured (estimated 253 seriously injured). It is the crash with the most non-passenger ground fatalities (not including 9/11). It is usually known as the 1996 Air Africa crash.

225: On May 25, 2002, a Boeing 747-209B, China Airlines Flight 611, bound for Hong Kong International Airport in Hong Kong, disintegrated in mid-air and crashed into the Taiwan Strait 20 minutes after takeoff from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (now Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport) in Taiwan. It was determined that the crash, which killed all 206 passengers and 19 crew members aboard the plane, was caused by improper repairs to the aircraft 22 years earlier when the aircraft encountered a tailstrike.

224: On October 31, 2015, an Airbus A321-231, Metrojet Flight 9268, crashed in the Sinai Peninsula after departing Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport, Egypt, en route to Pulkovo Airport, Saint Petersburg, Russia. All 224 occupants on board were killed. A branch of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for bringing down the jet, and a Russian investigation concluded that a bomb was detonated inside the plane at a high altitude.

223: On May 26, 1991, a Boeing 767-3Z9ER, Lauda Air Flight 004, broke up in midair over a remote area of Thailand due to an uncommanded deployment of a thrust reverser on one of the plane&#x27;s engines, killing all 223 occupants aboard. The flight, which originated at Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong, and made a stopover at Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, was en route to Vienna International Airport, Vienna, Austria, when the accident occurred.

217: On October 31, 1999, a Boeing 767-366ER, EgyptAir Flight 990, flying from Los Angeles International Airport, United States, to Cairo International Airport, Egypt, with a stop at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean south of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, killing all 217 occupants onboard. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the crash was deliberate action by the relief first officer in response to his removal from international service within Egyptair, a finding disputed by Egyptian authorities who maintain another cause of the accident.

213: On January 1, 1978, a Boeing 747-237B, Air India Flight 855, crashed into the Arabian Sea just off the coast of Bombay, India, killing all 213 occupants on board. An investigation concluded that the captain became disoriented after the failure of one of the flight instruments in the cockpit, leading to &quot;irrational control inputs&quot; that caused the plane to crash.

202: On February 16, 1998, an Airbus A300B4-622R, China Airlines Flight 676, en route from Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Indonesia, to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (now Taoyuan International Airport), Taiwan, crashed into a road and residential neighborhood in Taoyuan, Taiwan, killing 182 passengers, 14 crew, and six people on the ground. An investigation determined that when the control tower ordered the pilot to abort his landing and &quot;go around&quot; for a second attempt, the pilot, who had unintentionally released the plane&#x27;s autopilot, did nothing to take control of the plane for 11 seconds as he apparently thought the autopilot would initiate the go around. As the aircraft approached the airport, the pilot executed a sudden steep ascent that produced a stall and crash. China Airlines was also criticized for &quot;insufficient training&quot;.

200: On July 10, 1985, a Tupolev Tu-154B-2, Aeroflot Flight 7425, on a domestic Karshi–Ufa–Leningrad route, crashed near Uchkuduk, Uzbek SSR, Soviet Union, on the first leg of its route. All 200 occupants onboard were killed. An investigation concluded that the plane went down due to pilot error. The air crew used an inappropriately low airspeed, causing vibrations that they incorrectly interpreted as engine surges. As a result, they further reduced engine power, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.

== Safety ==
In over one hundred years of implementation, aviation safety has improved considerably. In modern times, two major manufacturers still produce heavy passenger aircraft for the civilian market: Boeing in the United States, and the European company Airbus. Both of these manufacturers place a huge emphasis on the use of aviation safety equipment, now a billion-dollar industry in its own right; safety is a key selling point for these companies, as they recognize that a poor safety record in the aviation industry is a threat to corporate survival.

Some major safety devices now required in commercial aircraft are:
* Evacuation slides, to aid rapid passenger exit from an aircraft in an emergency situation
* Advanced avionics, incorporating computerized auto-recovery and alert systems
* Turbine engines with improved durability and failure containment mechanisms
* Landing gear that can be lowered even after loss of power and hydraulics

Measured on a passenger-distance calculation, air travel is the safest form of transportation available: Figures mentioned are the ones shared by the air industry when quoting air safety statistics. A typical statement, e.g., by the BBC: &quot;UK airline operations are among the safest anywhere. When compared against all other modes of transport on a fatality per mile basis, air transport is the safest – six times safer than travelling by car and twice as safe as rail.&quot;

When measured by fatalities per person transported, however, buses are the safest form of transportation. The number of air travel fatalities per person are surpassed only by bicycles and motorcycles. This statistic is used by the insurance industry when calculating insurance rates for air travel.

For every billion kilometers traveled, trains have a fatality rate that is 12 times higher than that of air travel, and the fatality rate for automobiles is 62 times greater than for air travel. By contrast, for every billion journeys taken, buses are the safest form of transportation; using this measure, air travel is three times more dangerous than car transportation, and almost 30 times more dangerous than travelling by bus.

A 2007 study by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; magazine found that passengers sitting at the back of an aeroplane are 40% more likely to survive a crash than those sitting at the front. The article quotes Boeing, the FAA, and a website on aircraft safety, all of which claim that there is no &quot;safest&quot; seat. The study examined 20 crashes, not taking into account the developments in safety after those accidents. However, a flight data recorder is usually mounted in the aircraft&#x27;s empennage (tail section) where it is more likely to survive a severe crash.

Between 1983 and 2000, the survival rate for people in U.S. plane crashes was greater than 95 percent.

===Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System===
In an effort to prevent incidents such as the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a new standard has been issued requiring all commercial aircraft to report their position every 15 minutes to air traffic controllers regardless of the country of origin. Introduced in 2016 by the ICAO, the regulation has no initial requirement for any new aircraft equipment to be fitted. The standard is part of a long-term plan, called the Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS), which will require new aircraft to be equipped with data broadcast systems that are in constant contact with air traffic controllers. The GADSS is similar to the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) used for maritime safety.

===Aviation Safety Reporting System===
The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) collects voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident/situation reports from pilots, controllers and others. The ASRS uses reports to identify system deficiencies, issue alert messages, and produce two publications, &quot;CALLBACK&quot;, and &quot;ASRS Directline&quot;. The collected information is made available to the public, and is used by the FAA, NASA and other organizations working in research and flight safety.

==Statistics==

=== Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives (B3A) ===

The Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives (B3A), formerly known as the Aircraft Crashes Record Office (ACRO), a non-government organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, compiles statistics on aviation accidents of aircraft capable of carrying more than six passengers, excluding helicopters, balloons, and combat aircraft. ACRO only considers crashes in which the aircraft has suffered such damage that it is removed from service, which will further reduce the statistics for incidents and fatalities compared to some other data. The total fatalities due to aviation accidents since 1970 are 83,772. The total number of incidents are 11,164.

According to ACRO, recent years have been considerably safer for aviation, with fewer than 170 incidents every year between 2009 and 2017, compared to as many as 226 as recently as 1998.

The annual fatalities figure is less than 1,000 for ten of the fourteen years between 2007 and 2020, the year 2017 experiencing the lowest number of fatalities, at 399, since the end of World War II.

2014 included the disappearance of flight MH370 over the Indian Ocean and the shootdown of flight MH17 as part of the war in Donbas. The total number of fatalities in 2014 was 869 more than in 2013.

Deaths and incidents in the world per year according to ACRO and Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives data, :

(Data have significantly changed since November 2015 after a major upgrade to the death rate and crash rate web pages. This may reflect a change between a static and dynamic web page, where data were made to be automatically updated based on the incidents in their archives.)

===Annual Aviation Safety Review (EASA)===
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is tasked by Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 20, 2008, to provide an annual review of aviation safety.

The Annual Safety Review presents statistics on European and worldwide civil aviation safety. Statistics are grouped according to type of operation, for instance, commercial air transport, and aircraft category, such as aeroplanes, helicopters, gliders, etc.
The Agency has access to accident and statistical information collected by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). States are required, according to ICAO Annex 13, on Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation, to report to ICAO information, on accidents and serious incidents to aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off mass (MTOM) over 2250 kg. Therefore, most statistics in this review concern aircraft above this mass. In addition to the ICAO data, a request was made to the EASA Member States to obtain light aircraft accident data. Furthermore, data on the operation of aircraft for commercial air transport were obtained from both ICAO and the NLR Air Transport Safety Institute.

==Investigation==
Annex 13 of the Chicago Convention provides the international Standards And Recommended Practices that form the basis for air accident and incident investigations by signatory countries, as well as reporting and preventive measures. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is specifically focused on preventing accidents, rather than determining liability.

===Australia===
In Australia, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is the federal government body responsible for investigating transport-related accidents and incidents, covering air, sea, and rail travel. Formerly an agency of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in 2010, in the interests of keeping its independence it became a stand-alone agency.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) was established under the auspices of the Aeronautical Accident Investigation and Prevention Center, a Military Organization of the Brazilian Air Force (FAB). The organization is responsible for the activities of aircraft accident prevention, and investigation of civil and military aviation occurrences. Formed in 1971, and in accordance with international standards, CENIPA represented a new philosophy: investigations are conducted with the sole purpose of promoting the &quot;prevention of aeronautical accidents&quot;.

===Canada===
In Canada, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), is an independent agency responsible for the advancement of transportation safety through the investigation and reporting of accident and incident occurrences in all prevalent Canadian modes of transportation – marine, air, rail and pipeline.

===China===
In China, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is solely responsible for all air investigations and safety inside the country after the split from the formal CAAC Airlines.

===Ethiopia===
In Ethiopia, the Civil Aviation Accident Prevention and Investigation Bureau of the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA), which is an agency of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, conducts aircraft accident investigations in Ethiopia or involving Ethiopian aircraft.

===France===
In France, the agency responsible for investigation of civilian air crashes is the Bureau d&#x27;Enquêtes et d&#x27;Analyses pour la Sécurité de l&#x27;Aviation Civile (BEA). Its purpose is to establish the circumstances and causes of the accident and to make recommendations for their future avoidance.

===Germany===
In Germany, the agency for investigating air crashes is the Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation (BFU). It is an agency of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. The focus of the BFU is to improve safety by determining the causes of accidents and serious incidents and making safety recommendations to prevent recurrence.

===Hong Kong===
The Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) is responsible for investigating civil aviation accidents in Hong Kong, as well as those in other territories involving a Hong Kong-registered aircraft. It is led by Darren Straker, Chief Inspector of Accidents, and headquartered at Hong Kong International Airport. AAIA was established in 2018 in response to an ICAO directive instructing that member states maintain air accident investigation authorities that are independent of civil aviation authorities and related entities. Prior to 2018, accident investigation duties were held by the Civil Aviation Department&#x27;s Flight Standards &amp; Airworthiness Division and Accident Investigation Division.

=== India ===
Until May 30, 2012, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation investigated incidents involving aircraft. Since then, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has taken over investigation responsibilities.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC; , KNKT) is responsible for the investigation of incidents and accidents, including air accidents. Its aim is the improvement of transportation safety, not just aviation, in Indonesia.

===Italy===
Created in 1999 in Italy, the Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo (ANSV), has two main tasks: conducting technical investigations for civil aviation aircraft accidents and incidents, while issuing safety recommendations as appropriate; and conducting studies and surveys aimed at increasing flight safety. The organization is also responsible for establishing and maintaining the &quot;voluntary reporting system&quot;. Although not under the supervision of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, the ANSV is a public authority under the oversight of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of Italy.

===Japan===
The Japan Transport Safety Board investigates aviation accidents and incidents. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission investigated aviation accidents and incidents in Japan until October 1, 2001, when the Aircraft and Railway Accidents Investigation Commission (ARAIC) replaced it, and the ARAIC did this function until October 1, 2008, when it merged into the JTSB.

=== Malaysia ===
Established in 2016, the Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) Malaysia is the main investigation body for aircraft accident/incident. Separate from Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) and Malaysian Aviation Commission (MAVCOM) that is the national aviation authority and commission that oversee aviation economy respectively. The AAIB operates from the ministry of transport headquarters in Putrajaya, and its black box laboratory situated in STRIDE, the ministry of defenses research institute. AAIB Malaysia is teamed by civilians and seconded Royal Malaysian Airforce senior officer and a group of pool investigators from Malaysia Institute of Aviation Technology

In Mexico, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) investigates aviation accidents.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the Dutch Safety Board (&quot;Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid&quot;) is responsible for the investigation of incidents and accidents, including air accidents. Its aim is the improvement of safety in the Netherlands. Its main focus is on those situations in which civilians are dependent on the government, companies or organizations for their safety. The Board solely investigates when incidents or accidents occur and aims to draw lessons from the results of these investigations. The Safety Board is objective, impartial and independent in its judgment. The Board will always be critical towards all parties concerned.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) is responsible for the investigation of air accidents. &quot;The Commission&#x27;s purpose, as set out in its Act, is to determine the circumstances and causes of aviation, rail and maritime accidents, and incidents, with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future, rather than to ascribe blame to any person.&quot; The TAIC investigates with accordance with annex 13 of the ICAO and specific New Zealand legislation.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, State Commission on Aircraft Accidents Investigation (Polish: &quot;Państwowa Komisja Badania Wypadków Lotniczych&quot;, &quot;PKBWL&quot;) is responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents and incidents occurring in the country. Headquartered in Warsaw, the commission is a division of the Ministry of Infrastructure. As of November 2022, the head of the PKBWL is Bogusław Trela.

===Russia===
In Russia, the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC, MAK according to the original Russian name) is an executive body overseeing the use and management of civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States. This organization investigates air accidents in the former USSR area under the umbrella of the Air Accident Investigation Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee. There are active discussion to dismantling the committee, and in 2020, Armenia and Russia has signed on a joint agreement establishing the International Bureau for investigating aviation accidents and serious incidents (In Russian: Международное бюро по расследованию авиационных происшествий и серьезных инцидентов), designed to replace the committee and to act as upper body for investigation of aviation incidents and, subordinate to the Eurasian Union. The new body has been assigned duties to investigate serious accidents and incidents in accordance with the requirements of ICAO documents, ensuring independent investigation of accidents, cooperation and interaction between the parties in relation to investigating aircraft accidents, development and use of common rules and procedures for investigating aircraft accidents.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, the Taiwan Transportation Safety Board (TTSB) is the independent government agency that is responsible for major transportation accident investigations. TTSB&#x27;s predecessor was ASC, which was established in 1998. TTSB is under the administration of the Executive Yuan and independent from Civil Aviation Administration. The TTSB consisted of five to seven board members, including a chairman and a vice chairman, appointed by the Premier. The managing director of TTSB manages the day-to-day function of the organization, including accident investigations.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the agency responsible for investigation of civilian air crashes is the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the Department for Transport. Its purpose is to establish the circumstances and causes of the accident and to make recommendations for their future avoidance.

===United States===
United States civil aviation incidents are investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). NTSB officials piece together evidence from the crash site to determine likely cause, or causes. The NTSB also investigates overseas incidents involving US-registered aircraft, in collaboration with local investigative authorities, especially when significant loss of American lives occurs, or when the involved aircraft is American-built.

==Retirement of flight numbers==
Out of respect for the deceased and injured, it is common for an airline to cease using the flight number of a fatal crash. For example, following the shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the flight number was changed to MH19. Japan Airlines stopped using the flight number 350 after a fatal plane crash in Tokyo Bay. TransAsia Airways retired the flight number 235 and changed it to 2353 after a plane crash in 2015 that left 15 survivors. However, that is not always the case. For example, China Southern Airlines and FedEx Express continued using the flight number 3456 and 14 respectively even after China Southern Airlines had a fatal accident in 1997 and a FedEx Express aircraft crashed on landing a month later. Similarly, Japan Airlines and Singapore Airlines continued using the flight number 516 and 321 respectively, even after the Japan Airlines flight was involved in a collision in 2024 while the Singapore Airlines flight encountered severe turbulence and caused one death a few months later.

<text>Elias Charles Disney (February 6, 1859September 13, 1941) was a Canadian-American construction worker and entrepreneur. He was best known as the father of Roy and Walt Disney, co-founders of The Walt Disney Company.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Disney was born in the rural village of Bluevale, in what is now Ontario, Canada, to Irish Protestant immigrants Kepple Elias Disney (1832–1891) and Mary Disney (née Richardson) (1838–1909). Both parents had emigrated from Freshford, County Kilkenny in Ireland to Canada as children, accompanying their parents. His parents would have eight other children in the following 18 years after the birth of Elias. Disney&#x27;s father owned a farm and got into a variety of other business ventures to make money. The name Disney is derived from the Norman name D&#x27;Isigny.

He moved to California with his father in 1878 in hopes of finding gold. Instead, Kepple was convinced by an agent of the Union Pacific Railroad to buy of land near Ellis, Kansas. When the family moved, they would let go of their previously conservative ways with the exception of Elias. In Ellis, Disney attempted to live as an orange grower and failed.

=== Career ===
Disney worked on his father&#x27;s new farm until 1884, when he left to find another job. He was hired in a railroad machine shop for the Kansas Pacific Railroad (one of his co-workers was Walter Chrysler), then he joined the railroad crew building the Union Pacific line through Colorado. After the railroad contract was over, he became a professional fiddle player in Denver. Again he was unsuccessful, and he returned to his father&#x27;s farm.

His sister Annie would become a teacher at the Beaver Bank School located adjacent to the family farms starting in 1884. Elias would sometimes fill in as a substitute teacher for his sister, and there he started to get to know and eventually develop a relationship with one of her students, Flora Call. After she graduated, Flora&#x27;s parents would sell their land in Ellis and move to Acron, Florida, with Disney following suit wanting to be with Flora. Elias and Flora were married in Acron on January 1, 1888. Their marriage license was the first license ever issued by Lake County. Disney and his wife would move to Daytona Beach and manage the Halifax Hotel during the &quot;tourist season of 1888&quot; but left when the owner no longer needed a manager and kicked the two out of their rooms. They would have a son, Herbert, in December 1888. He also worked for a short time as a mailman in Kissimmee, Florida, close to the eventual site of Walt Disney World. Disney also attempted to make a career as an orange grower in Kissimmee, buying , but he was unsuccessful. After this he would decide to move to Chicago, leaving Florida during the late spring of 1890. Although frequently unsuccessful at self-employment, Disney&#x27;s entrepreneurial tendencies were passed on to his son Walt.

He would be a construction worker for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, an event which author Erik Larson suggests was a source of inspiration for his son Walt and the Disney kingdom he would eventually create. He bought shares of O-Zell Company, a jelly-canning factory that also produced apple juice in Chicago, where his son Walt Disney worked before he joined the Red Cross Ambulance Corps in World War I. The family would live at 3515 South Vernon Avenue in the Fourth Ward by 1890. On October 31, 1891, Disney bought a lot at 1249 Tripp Avenue By 1892, he had built a house on it. The neighborhood was called Hermosa and had been settled by Scottish, German, and Scandinavian immigrants. Their next two children were born there. The family would move into the new home located on Tripp Avenue on June 24, 1893, and shortly afterwards Flora give birth to a baby boy, Roy O. Disney. Disney wanted to name him Columbus but Flora wanted him to be named Roy instead, and Roy was picked. When it came to deciding on a middle name, there would be issues. One day, Flora saw a lumber truck on Tripp Avenue with the company name of Oliver Lumber Company painted across the sides of it. After seeing this truck, Elias and Flora would decide that Oliver would be Roy&#x27;s middle name.

By the turn of the century, Disney had become an active building contractor. He built houses which he owned and then resold. He also built the Saint Paul Congregational Church, a building dedicated on October 14, 1900. Disney was one of the church&#x27;s trustees, while his wife was its treasurer.

A neighboring family had two adolescent children involved in a car barn robbery, and Disney feared that crime would taint his own children. 
On March 5, 1906, he bought a farm near Marceline, Missouri, for $3,000, or $75 per acre. 
Its previous owner William E. Crane had died in November 1905. Crane was a veteran of the American Civil War, and his house predated the foundation of Marceline. 
On April 3, Disney bought an adjoining tract of about from Crane&#x27;s widow for an additional $450. 
Marceline was still accessible from Chicago but provided a rural setting, and Disney&#x27;s younger brother Robert owned a farm west of the city. 
Disney and his family settled on the farm in April.

The Crane Farm had orchards of apples, peaches, and plums and fields of grain. The farm animals included pigs, chickens, horses, and cows. The Disneys had a telephone connection by 1907. 
In 1907, Disney convinced some of his fellow farmers to join the American Society of Equity, a farmer&#x27;s union aiming to consolidate the members&#x27; buying power.

Herbert and Raymond Disney never liked life on the farm. They moved out around the fall of 1908, heading back to Chicago, where they found work as clerks.

The family sold the farm on November 28, 1910, as Disney fell ill. He was suffering from typhoid fever, followed by pneumonia. The Disneys lived in a rented house in Marceline, probably at 508 North Kansas Avenue, until 1911, when they moved to Kansas City, Missouri. They lived in a rented house at 2706 East Thirty-first Street. They stayed there until they bought their own modest home in September 1914. It was situated at 3028 Bellefontaine Street.

On July 1, 1911, Disney purchased a newspaper delivery route for &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;. It extended from the Twenty-seventh Street to the Thirty-first Street, and from Prospect Avenue to Indiana Avenue. Roy and Walt were put to work delivering the newspapers. The Disneys delivered the morning newspaper &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; to about 700 customers and the evening and Sunday &quot;Star&quot; to more than 600. Their customers increased with time. Disney also delivered butter and eggs to his newspaper customers. They were imported from a dairy farm in Marceline.

Disney sold the paper route on March 17, 1917. He had been investing in the O-Zell Company of Chicago since 1912 and moved back to the city in 1917 to take an active role in its management. The Disneys rented a flat at 1523 Ogden Avenue.

He retired from management work in 1920 and moved back to Kansas City. He was again listed as a carpenter. He moved to Portland, Oregon, by the fall (autumn September–October) of 1921. His son Herbert had earlier moved to this city.

=== Personal life and death ===

Disney married Flora Call (1868-1938) on January 1, 1888, in Kismet, Lake County, Florida, north of the land on which Walt Disney World would eventually be built and lived for a short time in adjoining Acron, Florida. She was the daughter of his father&#x27;s neighbors.

Soon after marriage, the Disneys moved to Chicago, Illinois, where Disney met and befriended Walter Parr, St. Paul Congregational Church&#x27;s preacher for whom the Disneys&#x27; fourth son Walt was named.

The couple had five children:
*Herbert Arthur Disney (December 8, 1888 – January 29, 1961, aged 72), letter carrier (1940 US Census)
*Raymond Arnold Disney (December 30, 1890 – May 24, 1989, aged 98), self-employed insurance broker (1940 US Census)
*Roy Oliver Disney (June 24, 1893 – December 20, 1971, aged 78), businessman and co-founder of The Walt Disney Company 
*Walter &quot;Walt&quot; Elias Disney (December 5, 1901 – December 15, 1966, aged 65), entrepreneur and co-founder of The Walt Disney Company
*Ruth Flora Disney (December 6, 1903 – April 7, 1995, aged 91), philanthropist

Disney was a member of the Congregational Church and often preached stern sermons on Sundays in this church. His son Walter Elias Disney was named after a Congregationalist minister named Walter Parr. Disney and Walt had a tense relationship as Disney never saw Walt&#x27;s profession as an artist as a real job.

Disney&#x27;s son Raymond Arnold Disney named his son Charles Elias Disney after his father Elias Charles Disney.

Disney died on September 13, 1941, in Los Angeles aged 82. He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park at Glendale, California.

===Beliefs and habits===
Disney never drank alcohol and rarely smoked. According to biographical accounts, Disney was a stern man who could have a strong temper at times and would take the money his sons earned for &quot;safekeeping,&quot; considering them too young to know the value of money. If his children misbehaved, Disney would not hesitate to punish them with a switch.

Disney was an ardent socialist and a supporter of Eugene Debs. Disney would talk socialism with various people and bring them home. He was a fiddler and would bring home anyone else who could play an instrument.

<text>Soil formation, also known as pedogenesis, is the process of soil genesis as regulated by the effects of place, environment, and history. Biogeochemical processes act to both create and destroy order (anisotropy) within soils. These alterations lead to the development of layers, termed soil horizons, distinguished by differences in color, structure, texture, and chemistry. These features occur in patterns of soil type distribution, forming in response to differences in soil forming factors.

Pedogenesis is studied as a branch of pedology, the study of soil in its natural environment. Other branches of pedology are the study of soil morphology and soil classification. The study of pedogenesis is important to understanding soil distribution patterns in current (soil geography) and past (paleopedology) geologic periods.

==Overview==
Soil develops through a series of changes. The starting point is weathering of freshly accumulated parent material. A variety of soil microbes (bacteria, archaea, fungi) feed on simple compounds (nutrients) released by weathering and produce organic acids and specialized proteins which contribute in turn to mineral weathering. They also leave behind organic residues which contribute to humus formation. Plant roots with their symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi are also able to extract nutrients from rocks.

New soils increase in depth by a combination of weathering and further deposition. The soil production rate due to weathering is approximately 1/10 mm per year. New soils can also deepen from dust deposition. Gradually soil is able to support higher forms of plants and animals, starting with pioneer species and proceeding along ecological succession to more complex plant and animal communities. Topsoils deepen with the accumulation of humus originating from dead remains of higher plants and soil microbes. They also deepen through mixing of organic matter with weathered minerals. As soils mature, they develop soil horizons as organic matter accumulates and mineral weathering and leaching take place.

==Factors==

Soil formation is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil. They are: parent material, climate, topography (relief), organisms, and time. When reordered to climate, organisms, relief, parent material, and time, they form the acronym CLORPT.

===Parent material===
The mineral material from which a soil forms is called parent material. Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent rock is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.

Typical soil parent mineral materials are:
* Quartz: SiO2
* Calcite: CaCO3
* Feldspar: KAlSi3O8
* Mica (biotite): 
Parent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary bedrock. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.

Residual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.

Most soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity:
* Aeolian processes (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming loess soils (60–90 percent silt), common in the Midwestern United States and Canada, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.
* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. Alluvial materials are those moved and deposited by flowing water. Sedimentary deposits settled in lakes are called lacustrine. Lake Bonneville and many soils around the Great Lakes are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the Imperial Valley of California are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.
* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral moraines in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines, and in all cases outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.
* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as talus cones and is called colluvial material.

Cumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes peat and muck soils and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.

==== Weathering ====
The weathering of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth. Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable. Chemical decomposition is a function of mineral solubility, the rate of which doubles with each 10 °C rise in temperature but is strongly dependent on water to effect chemical changes. Rocks that will decompose in a few years in tropical climates will remain unaltered for millennia in deserts. Structural changes are the result of hydration, oxidation, and reduction. Chemical weathering mainly results from the excretion of organic acids and chelating compounds by bacteria and fungi, thought to increase under greenhouse effect.
* &quot;Physical disintegration&quot; is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil. Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of &quot;shells&quot;. Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Organisms may reduce parent material size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals. 
* &quot;Chemical decomposition&quot; and &quot;structural changes&quot; result when minerals are made soluble by water or are changed in structure. The first three of the following list are solubility changes, and the last three are structural changes.

# The &quot;solution&quot; of salts in water results from the action of bipolar water molecules on ionic salt compounds producing a solution of ions and water, removing those minerals and reducing the rock&#x27;s integrity, at a rate depending on water flow and pore channels.
# &quot;Hydrolysis&quot; is the transformation of minerals into polar molecules by the splitting of intervening water. This results in soluble acid-base pairs. For example, the hydrolysis of orthoclase-feldspar transforms it to acid silicate clay and basic potassium hydroxide, both of which are more soluble.
# In &quot;carbonation&quot;, the solution of carbon dioxide in water forms carbonic acid. Carbonic acid will transform calcite into more soluble calcium bicarbonate.
# &quot;Hydration&quot; is the inclusion of water in a mineral structure, causing it to swell and leaving it stressed and easily decomposed.
# &quot;Oxidation&quot; of a mineral compound is the inclusion of oxygen in a mineral, causing it to increase its oxidation number and swell due to the relatively large size of oxygen, leaving it stressed and more easily attacked by water (hydrolysis) or carbonic acid (carbonation).
# &quot;Reduction&quot;, the opposite of oxidation, means the removal of oxygen, hence the oxidation number of some part of the mineral is reduced, which occurs when oxygen is scarce. The reduction of minerals leaves them electrically unstable, more soluble and internally stressed and easily decomposed. It mainly occurs in waterlogged conditions.

Of the above, hydrolysis and carbonation are the most effective, in particular in regions of high rainfall, temperature and physical erosion. Chemical weathering becomes more effective as the surface area of the rock increases, thus is favoured by physical disintegration. This stems in latitudinal and altitudinal climate gradients in regolith formation.

Saprolite is a particular example of a residual soil formed from the transformation of granite, metamorphic and other types of bedrock into clay minerals. Often called weathered granite, saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include: hydrolysis, chelation from organic compounds, hydration and physical processes that include freezing and thawing. The mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary bedrock material, its physical features (including grain size and degree of consolidation), and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral. The texture, pH and mineral constituents of saprolite are inherited from its parent material. This process is also called &quot;arenization&quot;, resulting in the formation of sandy soils, thanks to the much higher resistance of quartz compared to other mineral components of granite (e.g., mica, amphibole, feldspar).

===Climate===
The principal climatic variables influencing soil formation are effective precipitation (i.e., precipitation minus evapotranspiration) and temperature, both of which affect the rates of chemical, physical, and biological processes. Temperature and moisture both influence the organic matter content of soil through their effects on the balance between primary production and decomposition: the colder or drier the climate the lesser atmospheric carbon is fixed as organic matter while the lesser organic matter is decomposed. Climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity, which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil.

Climate is the dominant factor in soil formation, and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the climate zones in which they form, with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere. If warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time, the processes of weathering, leaching, and plant growth will be maximized. According to the climatic determination of biomes, humid climates favor the growth of trees. In contrast, grasses are the dominant native vegetation in subhumid and semiarid regions, while shrubs and brush of various kinds dominate in arid areas.

Water is essential for all the major chemical weathering reactions. To be effective in soil formation, water must penetrate the regolith. The seasonal rainfall distribution, evaporative losses, site topography, and soil permeability interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation. The greater the depth of water penetration, the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development. Surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper layers (eluviation) to the lower layers (illuviation), including clay particles and dissolved organic matter. It may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters. Thus, percolating water stimulates weathering reactions and helps differentiate soil horizons. 

Likewise, a deficiency of water is a major factor in determining the characteristics of soils of dry regions. Soluble salts are not leached from these soils, and in some cases they build up to levels that curtail plant and microbial growth. Soil profiles in arid and semi-arid regions are also apt to accumulate carbonates and certain types of expansive clays (calcrete or caliche horizons). In tropical soils, when the soil has been deprived of vegetation (e.g. by deforestation) and thereby is submitted to intense evaporation, the upward capillary movement of water, which has dissolved iron and aluminum salts, is responsible for the formation of a superficial hard pan of laterite or bauxite, respectively, which is improper for cultivation, a known case of irreversible soil degradation.

The direct influences of climate include:
* A shallow accumulation of lime in low rainfall areas as caliche
* Formation of acid soils in humid areas
* Erosion of soils on steep hillsides
* Deposition of eroded materials downstream
* Very intense chemical weathering, leaching, and erosion in warm and humid regions where soil does not freeze

Climate directly affects the rate of weathering and leaching. Wind moves sand and smaller particles (dust), especially in arid regions where there is little plant cover, depositing it close to or far from the entrainment source. The type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil, and aid in the development of different soil profiles. Soil profiles are more distinct in wet and cool climates, where organic materials may accumulate, than in wet and warm climates, where organic materials are rapidly consumed. The effectiveness of water in weathering parent rock material depends on seasonal and daily temperature fluctuations, which favour tensile stresses in rock minerals, and thus their mechanical disaggregation, a process called thermal fatigue. By the same process freeze-thaw cycles are an effective mechanism which breaks up rocks and other consolidated materials.

===Topography===
The topography, or relief, is characterized by the inclination (slope), elevation, and orientation of the terrain (aspect). Topography determines the rate of precipitation or runoff and the rate of formation or erosion of the surface soil profile. The topographical setting may either hasten or retard the work of climatic forces.

Steep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by erosion and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence, little mineral deposition in lower profiles (illuviation). In semiarid regions, the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover, so there is less plant contribution to soil formation. For all of these reasons, steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction. Therefore, soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow, poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby, more level sites.

Topography determines exposure to weather, fire, and other forces of man and nature. Mineral accumulations, plant nutrients, type of vegetation, vegetation growth, erosion, and water drainage are dependent on topographic relief. Soils at the bottom of a hill will get more water than soils on the slopes, and soils on the slopes that face the sun&#x27;s path will be drier than soils on slopes that do not.

In swales and depressions where runoff water tends to concentrate, the regolith is usually more deeply weathered, and soil profile development is more advanced. However, in the lowest landscape positions, water may saturate the regolith to such a degree that drainage and aeration are restricted. Here, the weathering of some minerals and the decomposition of organic matter are retarded, while the loss of iron and manganese is accelerated. In such low-lying topography, special profile features characteristic of wetland soils may develop. Depressions allow the accumulation of water, minerals and organic matter, and in the extreme, the resulting soils will be saline marshes or peat bogs.

Recurring patterns of topography result in toposequences or soil catenas. These patterns emerge from topographic differences in erosion, deposition, fertility, soil moisture, plant cover, soil biology, fire history, and exposure to the elements. Gravity transports water downslope, together with mineral and organic solutes and colloids, increasing particulate and base content at the foot of hills and mountains. However, many other factors like drainage and erosion interact with slope position, blurring its expected influence on crop yield.

===Organisms===
Each soil has a unique combination of microbial, plant, animal and human influences acting upon it. Microorganisms are particularly influential in the mineral transformations critical to the soil forming process. Additionally, some bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen, and some fungi are efficient at extracting deep soil phosphorus and increasing soil carbon levels in the form of glomalin. Plants hold soil against erosion, and accumulated plant material build soil humus levels. Plant root exudation supports microbial activity. Animals serve to decompose plant materials and mix soil through bioturbation.

Soil is the most speciose (species-rich) ecosystem on Earth, but the vast majority of organisms in soil are microbes, a great many of which have not been described. There may be a population limit of around one billion cells per gram of soil, but estimates of the number of species vary widely from 50,000 per gram to over a million per gram of soil. The number of organisms and species can vary widely according to soil type, location, and depth.

Plants, animals, fungi, bacteria and humans affect soil formation (see soil biomantle and stonelayer). Soil animals, including fauna and soil mesofauna, mix soils as they form burrows and pores, allowing moisture and gases to move about, a process called bioturbation. In the same way, plant roots penetrate soil horizons and open channels upon decomposition. Plants with deep taproots can penetrate many metres through the different soil layers to bring up nutrients from deeper in the profile. Plants have fine roots that excrete organic compounds (sugars, organic acids, mucilage), slough off cells (in particular at their tip), and are easily decomposed, adding organic matter to soil, a process called &quot;rhizodeposition&quot;. 

Microorganisms, including fungi and bacteria, effect chemical exchanges between roots and soil and act as a reserve of nutrients in a soil biological hotspot called rhizosphere. The growth of roots through the soil stimulates microbial populations, stimulating in turn the activity of their predators (notably amoeba), thereby increasing the mineralization rate, and in last turn root growth, a positive feedback called the soil microbial loop. Out of root influence, in the bulk soil most bacteria are in a quiescent stage, forming micro-aggregates, i.e. mucilaginous colonies to which clay particles are glued, offering them a protection against desiccation and predation by soil microfauna (bacteriophagous protozoa and nematodes). Microaggregates (20–250 μm) are ingested by soil mesofauna and fauna, and bacterial bodies are partly or totally digested in their guts.

Humans impact soil formation by removing vegetation cover through tillage, application of biocides, fire and leaving soils bare. This can lead to erosion, waterlogging, lateritization or podzolization (according to climate and topography). Tillage mixes the different soil layers, restarting the soil formation process as less weathered material is mixed with the more developed upper layers, resulting in net increased rate of mineral weathering.

Earthworms, ants, termites, moles, gophers, as well as some millipedes and tenebrionid beetles, mix the soil as they burrow, significantly affecting soil formation. Earthworms ingest soil particles and organic residues, enhancing the availability of plant nutrients in the material that passes through their bodies. They aerate and stir the soil and create stable soil aggregates, after having disrupted links between soil particles during the intestinal transit of ingested soil, thereby assuring ready infiltration of water. As ants and termites build mounds, earthworms transport soil materials from one horizon to another. Other important functions are fulfilled by earthworms in the soil ecosystem, in particular their intense mucus production, both within the intestine and as a lining in their galleries, exert a priming effect on soil microflora, giving them the status of ecosystem engineers, which they share with ants and termites.

In general, the mixing of the soil by the activities of animals, sometimes called pedoturbation, tends to undo or counteract the tendency of other soil-forming processes that create distinct horizons. Termites and ants may also retard soil profile development by denuding large areas of soil around their nests, leading to increased loss of soil by erosion. Large animals such as gophers, moles, and prairie dogs bore into the lower soil horizons, bringing materials to the surface. Their tunnels are often open to the surface, encouraging the movement of water and air into the subsurface layers. In localized areas, they enhance mixing of the lower and upper horizons by creating and later refilling the tunnels. Old animal burrows in the lower horizons often become filled with soil material from the overlying A horizon, creating profile features known as &quot;crotovinas&quot;.

Vegetation impacts soils in numerous ways. It can prevent erosion caused by excessive rain that might result from surface runoff. Plants shade soils, keeping them cooler and slowing evaporation of soil moisture. Conversely, by way of transpiration, plants can cause soils to lose moisture, resulting in complex and highly variable relationships between leaf area index (measuring light interception) and moisture loss: more generally plants prevent soil from desiccation during driest months while they dry it during moister months, thereby acting as a buffer against strong moisture variation. Plants can form new chemicals that can break down minerals, both directly and indirectly through mycorrhizal fungi and rhizosphere bacteria, and improve the soil structure. The type and amount of vegetation depend on climate, topography, soil characteristics and biological factors, mediated or not by human activities. Soil factors such as density, depth, chemistry, pH, temperature and moisture greatly affect the type of plants that can grow in a given location. Dead plants and fallen leaves and stems begin their decomposition on the surface. There, organisms feed on them and mix the organic material with the upper soil layers; these added organic compounds become part of the soil formation process.

The influence of humans, and by association, fire, are state factors placed within the organisms state factor. Humans can import or extract nutrients and energy in ways that dramatically change soil formation. Accelerated soil erosion from overgrazing, and Pre-Columbian terraforming the Amazon basin resulting in &quot;terra preta&quot; are two examples of the effects of human management.

It is believed that Native Americans regularly set fires to maintain several large areas of prairie grasslands in Indiana and Michigan, although climate and mammalian grazers (e.g. bisons) are also advocated to explain the maintenance of the Great Plains of North America. In more recent times, human destruction of natural vegetation and subsequent tillage of the soil for crop production has abruptly modified soil formation. Likewise, irrigating soil in an arid region drastically influences soil-forming factors, as does adding fertilizer and lime to soils of low fertility.

Distinct ecosystems produce distinct soils, sometimes in easily observable ways. For example, three species of land snails in the genus &quot;Euchondrus&quot; in the Negev desert are noted for eating lichens growing under the surface limestone rocks and slabs (endolithic lichens). The grazing activity of these ecosystem engineers disrupts the limestone, resulting in the weathering and the subsequent formation of soil. They have a significant effect on the region: the population of snails is estimated to process between 0.7 and 1.1 metric ton per hectare per year of limestone in the Negev desert.

The effects of ancient ecosystems are not as easily observed, and this challenges the understanding of soil formation. For example, the chernozems of the North American tallgrass prairie have a humus fraction nearly half of which is charcoal. This outcome was not anticipated because the antecedent prairie fire ecology capable of producing these distinct deep rich black soils is not easily observed.

===Time===
Time is a factor in the interactions of all the above. While a mixture of sand, silt and clay constitute the texture of a soil and the aggregation of those components produces peds, the development of a distinct B horizon marks the development of a soil or pedogenesis. With time, soils will evolve features that depend on the interplay of the prior listed soil-forming factors. It takes decades to several thousand years for a soil to develop a profile, although the notion of soil development has been criticized, soil being in a constant state-of-change under the influence of fluctuating soil-forming factors. That time period depends strongly on climate, parent material, relief, and biotic activity. For example, recently deposited material from a flood exhibits no soil development as there has not been enough time for the material to form a structure that further defines soil. The original soil surface is buried, and the formation process must begin anew for this deposit. Over time the soil will develop a profile that depends on the intensities of biota and climate. While a soil can achieve relative stability of its properties for extended periods, the soil life cycle ultimately ends in soil conditions that leave it vulnerable to erosion. Despite the inevitability of soil retrogression and degradation, most soil cycles are long.

Soil-forming factors continue to affect soils during their existence, even on stable landscapes that are long-enduring, some for millions of years. Materials are deposited on top or are blown or washed from the surface. With additions, removals and alterations, soils are always subject to new conditions. Whether these are slow or rapid changes depends on climate, topography and biological activity.

Time as a soil-forming factor may be investigated by studying soil chronosequences, in which soils of different ages but with minor differences in other soil-forming factors can be compared. Paleosols are soils formed during previous soil forming conditions.

==History of research==
===Dokuchaev&#x27;s equation===
Russian geologist Vasily Dokuchaev, commonly regarded as the father of pedology, determined in 1883 that soil formation occurs over time under the influence of climate, vegetation, topography, and parent material. He demonstrated this in 1898 using the soil forming equation:
(where cl or c climate, o biological processes, p parent material) tr relative time (young, mature, old)

===Hans Jenny&#x27;s state equation===
American soil scientist Hans Jenny published in 1941 a state equation for the factors influencing soil formation:

* S soil formation
* cl (sometimes c) climate
* o organisms (soil microbiology, soil mesofauna, soil biology)
* r relief
* p parent material
* t time

This is often remembered with the mnemonic Clorpt.

Jenny&#x27;s state equation in Factors of Soil Formation differs from the Vasily Dokuchaev equation, treating time (t) as a factor, adding topographic relief (r), and pointedly leaving the ellipsis &quot;open&quot; for more factors (state variables) to be added as our understanding becomes more refined.

There are two principal methods by which the state equation may be solved: first in a theoretical or conceptual manner by logical deductions from certain premises, and second empirically by experimentation or field observation. The empirical method is still mostly employed today, and soil formation can be defined by varying a single factor and keeping the other factors constant. This had led to the development of empirical models to describe pedogenesis, such as climofunctions, biofunctions, topofunctions, lithofunctions, and chronofunctions. Since Jenny published his formulation in 1941, it has been used by innumerable soil surveyors all over the world as a qualitative list for understanding the factors that may be important for producing the soil pattern within a region.
==Example==
An example of the evolution of soils in prehistoric lake beds is in the Makgadikgadi Pans of the Kalahari Desert, where a change in an ancient river course led to millennia of salinity buildup and formation of calcretes and silcretes.

<text>A sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is an event in which polar stratospheric temperatures rise by several tens of kelvins (up to increases of about 50 °C (90 °F)) over the course of a few days. The warming is preceded by a slowing then reversal of the westerly winds in the stratospheric polar vortex, commonly measured at 60  ° latitude at the 10 hPa level. SSWs occur about six times per decade in the northern hemisphere (NH), and about once every 20-30 years in the southern hemisphere (SH). In the SH, SSW accompanied by a reversal of the vortex westerly (which is soon after followed by a vortex recovery) was observed once during the period 1979–2024; this was in September 2002. Stratospheric warming in September 2019 was comparable to or even greater than that of 2002, but the wind reversal did not occur.

== History ==
The first continued measurements of the stratosphere were taken by Richard Scherhag in 1951 using radiosondes to take reliable temperature readings in the upper stratosphere (~40 km) and he became the first to observe stratospheric warming on 27 January 1952. After his discovery, he assembled a team of meteorologists at the Free University of Berlin specifically to study the stratosphere, and this group continued to map the NH stratospheric temperature and geopotential height for many years using radiosondes and rocketsondes.

When the weather satellites era began, meteorological measurements became far more frequent. Although satellites were primarily used for the troposphere, they also recorded data for the stratosphere. Today both satellites and stratospheric radiosondes are used to take measurements of the stratosphere.

== Classification and description ==
SSW is closely associated with polar vortex breakdown. Meteorologists typically classify vortex breakdown into three categories: major, minor, and final. No unambiguous standard definition of these has so far been adopted. However, differences in the methodology to detect SSWs are not relevant as long as circulation in the polar stratosphere reverses. &quot;Major SSWs occur when the winter polar stratospheric westerlies reverse to easterlies. In minor warmings, the polar temperature gradient reverses but the circulation does not, and in final warmings, the vortex breaks down and remains easterly until the following boreal autumn&quot;. However, this classification is based on the NH SSWs, as no major SSW by this definition has been observed in the SH in winter.

Sometimes a fourth category, the Canadian warming, is included because of its unique and distinguishing structure and evolution.

&quot;There are two main types of SSW: displacement events in which the stratospheric polar vortex is displaced from the pole and split events in which the vortex splits into two or more vortices. Some SSWs are a combination of both types&quot;.

=== Major ===
These occur when the westerly winds at 60°N and 10 hPa reverse, i.e. become easterly. A complete disruption of the polar vortex is observed and the vortex will either be split into daughter vortices, or displaced from its normal location over the pole.

According to the World Meteorological Organization&#x27;s Commission for Atmospheric Sciences: &quot;a stratospheric warming can be said to be major if at 10 mb or below the latitudinal mean temperature increases poleward from 60 degree latitude and an associated circulation reversal is observed (that is, the prevailing mean westerly winds poleward of 60° latitude are succeeded by mean easterlies in the same area).&quot;

=== Minor ===
Minor warmings are similar to major warmings; however, they are less dramatic: the westerly winds are slowed but do not reverse. Therefore, a breakdown of the vortex before its final breakdown is never observed. All the SH SSWs observed since 1979 were minor warmings except for that in September 2002.

McInturff cites the WMO&#x27;s Commission for Atmospheric Sciences: &quot;a stratospheric warming is called minor if a significant temperature increase is observed (that is, at least 25 degrees in a period of week or less) at any stratospheric level in any area of winter time hemisphere. The polar vortex is not broken down and the wind reversal from westerly to easterly is less extensive.&quot;

=== Final ===
The radiative cycle in the stratosphere means that during winter the mean flow is westerly and during summer it is easterly. A final warming occurs on this transition, so that the polar vortex winds change direction for the warming and do not change back until the following winter. This is because the stratosphere has entered the summer easterly phase. It is final because another warming cannot occur over the summer, so it is the final warming of the current winter. Most of the SH SSWs fall into this category as their onsets most commonly occur sometime in austral spring months, and the stratospheric wind and temperature anomalies tend to persist until early summer. In this sense, SH SSWs represent faster-than-normal seasonal march of the westerly polar vortex.

=== Canadian ===
Canadian warmings occur in early winter in the stratosphere of the NH, typically from mid-November to early December. They have no counterpart in the SH.

== Dynamics ==
In a usual NH winter, several minor warming events occur, with a major event occurring roughly every two years. One reason for major stratospheric warmings in the NH is that orography and land-sea temperature contrasts are responsible for the generation of long (wavenumber 1 or 2) Rossby waves in the troposphere. These planetary-scale waves travel upward to the stratosphere and dissipate there, decelerating the westerly winds and warming the Arctic. This is the reason that major warmings are usually only observed in the NH, with an exception observed in September 2002. As the SH is largely an ocean hemisphere, the planetary-scale wave activity is much weaker, and the SH vortex westerly is much stronger in winter, which partly explains why major SSW has not been observed in the SH winter at least in the instrumental observation era. 

At an initial time a blocking-type circulation pattern establishes in the troposphere. This blocking pattern causes Rossby waves with zonal wavenumber 1 and/or 2 to grow to unusually large amplitudes. The growing wave propagates into the stratosphere and decelerates the westerly mean zonal winds. Thus the polar night jet weakens and simultaneously becomes distorted by the growing planetary waves. Because the wave amplitude increases with decreasing density, this easterly acceleration process is not effective at fairly high levels. If the waves are sufficiently strong, the mean zonal flow may decelerate sufficiently so that the winter westerlies turn easterly. At this point planetary waves may no longer penetrate into the stratosphere ). Hence, further upward transfer of energy is completely blocked and a very rapid easterly acceleration and the polar warming occur at this critical level, which must then move downward until eventually the warming and zonal wind reversal affect the entire polar stratosphere. This wave-mean flow interaction explains the stratosphere-troposphere downward coupling during the SH SSW events as well. The upward propagation of planetary waves and their interaction with the stratospheric mean flow is traditionally diagnosed via so-called Eliassen-Palm fluxes.

There is a link between sudden stratospheric warmings and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO): if the QBO is in its easterly phase, the atmospheric waveguide is modified in such a way that upward-propagating Rossby waves are focused on the polar vortex, intensifying their interaction with the mean flow. Thus, there exists a statistically significant imbalance between the frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings if these events are grouped according to the QBO phase (easterly or westerly). However, the QBO-polar vortex relationship is less statistically significant in the SH. 

== Weather and climate effects ==
Although sudden stratospheric warmings are mainly forced by planetary-scale waves which propagate up from the lower atmosphere, there is also a subsequent return effect of sudden stratospheric warmings on surface weather and climate. Following a sudden stratospheric warming, the high altitude westerly winds reverse and are replaced by easterlies. The easterly winds progress down through the atmosphere, often leading to a weakening of the tropospheric westerly winds, resulting in dramatic reductions in temperature in Northern Europe. This process can take a few days to a few weeks to occur. 

Similar downward processes are found in the SH in the austral late spring to early summer seasons. SH SSWs in austral spring tend to cause the Antarctic ozone concentration to be higher than normal from spring to early summer, and both weaker vortex and higher Antarctic ozone act to cause the tropospheric jet to shift equatorward, which is expressed as a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in the SH extratropical geopotential height and surface pressure fields in the subsequent late spring to early summer seasons. SSWs in austral spring have been found to result in warmer and drier conditions over eastern Australia during late spring-early summer, increasing the risk of forest/bushfires, but cooler and wetter conditions over Patagonia. Also, austral spring to late spring SSWs influence the Antarctic sea-ice extent in the subsequent early summer season.

<text>An annual cycle refers to a set of changes or events that uniformly, or consistently, take place at the same time of year.

In biology, the annual cycle for plants and animals details behavioral and chemical changes that take place as the seasons advance.

In business, a business cycle refers to the way modelling and analysis is applied to the periodic development and marketing of new products and services.

In religion, the annual cycle refers to the various celebrations or memorials that occur in the same sequence from year to year. For example, in Christianity the liturgical year is an annual cycle, which for some Christian denominations is composed of the &quot;temporal cycle&quot; that tracks the events in the life of Christ, and the &quot;sanctoral cycle&quot; which tracks the various saint&#x27;s days. Some Christian churches only observe the &quot;temporal cycle&quot;.

In climatology, an annual cycle is the part of a measured quantity&#x27;s fluctuation that is attributed to Earth&#x27;s changing position in orbit over the course of the year. Such quantities might be influenced directly (e.g. incoming solar radiation at a point at the surface) or indirectly (e.g. stratospheric westerlies and easterlies over the winter and summer hemispheres, respectively) by orbital position.

Mathematically, the climatological annual cycle is commonly estimated from observational data or model output by taking the average of all Januaries, all Februaries, and so forth. If the observational record is long enough and conditions are stationary (i.e. there is no significant long-term trend), a meaningful annual cycle will result that can be used to calculate an anomaly time series.

<doc id="164556" wikidata="Q193379" url="?curid=164556" title="Archon">
<text>Archon (, , &quot;árchontes&quot;) is a Greek word that means &quot;ruler&quot;, frequently used as the title of a specific public office. It is the masculine present participle of the verb stem , meaning &quot;to be first, to rule&quot;, derived from the same root as words such as monarch and hierarchy.

==Ancient Greece==
In the early literary period of ancient Greece, the chief magistrates of various Greek city states were called &quot;archontes&quot;. The term was also used throughout Greek history in a more general sense, ranging from &quot;club leader&quot; to &quot;master of the tables&quot; at &quot;syssitia&quot; to &quot;Roman governor&quot;.

In Athens, a system of three concurrent archons evolved, the three office holders being known as &quot;archon eponymos&quot; (), the &quot;polemarch&quot; (), and the &quot;archon basileus&quot; (). According to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Constitution of the Athenians&quot;, the power of the king first devolved to the archons, and these offices were filled from the aristocracy by elections every ten years. During this period, the archon eponymos was the chief magistrate, the polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the archon basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements. After 683 BC, the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the archon eponymos. (Many ancient calendar systems did not number their years consecutively.) Although the process of the next transition is unclear, after 487 BC the archonships were assigned by lot to any citizen and the polemarch&#x27;s military duties were taken over by a new class of generals known as &quot;strategoi&quot;. The polemarch thereafter had only minor religious duties. The archon eponymos remained the titular head of state under democracy, though of much reduced political importance. The archons were assisted by &quot;junior archons&quot;, called &quot;thesmothetai&quot; (pl. of &quot;thesmothetēs&quot;). After 487 BC, ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the Areopagus, though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time.

Under the Athenian constitution, archons were also in charge of organizing festivals by bringing together poets, playwrights, actors, and city-appointed choregoi (wealthy citizen patrons). The archon would begin this process months in advance of a festival by selecting a chorus of three playwrights based on descriptions of the projected plays. Each playwright would be assigned a choregos, also selected by the archon, from among the wealthy citizens who would pay all the expenses of costumes, masks, and training the chorus. The archon also assigned each playwright a principal actor (the &quot;protagonist&quot;), as well as a second and third actor. The City Dionysia, an ancient dramatic festival held in March in which tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama originated, was under the direction of one of the principal magistrates, the &quot;archon eponymos&quot;.

==Byzantine Empire==
Byzantine historians usually described foreign rulers as &quot;archontes&quot;. The rulers of the Bulgars themselves, along with their own titles, often bear the title &quot;archon placed by God&quot; in inscriptions in Greek.

Inside Byzantium, the term could be used to refer to any powerful noble or magnate, but in a technical sense, it was applied to a class of provincial governors. In the 8th and 9th centuries, these were the governors of some of the more peripheral provinces, inferior in status to the &quot;themata&quot;: Dalmatia, Cephalonia, Crete and Cyprus. &quot;Archontes&quot; were also placed in charge of various naval bases and trade stations, as well as semi-autonomous Slavic-inhabited areas (&quot;sclaviniae&quot;) under Byzantine sovereignty. In the 10th–12th centuries, &quot;archontes&quot; are also mentioned as the governors of specific cities. The area of an archon&#x27;s jurisdiction was called an archontia (). The title was also used for the holders of several financial posts, such as the head of the mint (), as well as directors of the imperial workshops, arsenals, etc.

The title of megas archon (&quot;grand archon&quot;) is also attested, as a translation of foreign titles such as &quot;grand prince&quot;. In the mid-13th century, it was established as a special court rank, held by the highest-ranking official of the emperor&#x27;s company. It existed throughout the Palaiologan period, but did not have any specific functions.

==Ottoman Empire==

During the centuries of Ottoman rule in Greece, archons remained a part of urban administration. In Athens during this period, there were four archons appointed every two years by the citizens to serve in the city government as representatives of the Greeks. These archons served alongside the Cadi (Islamic judge) in the court of the Voivode. The archons of Ottoman Athens were chosen from the most powerful and wealthy families in the city.

==Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople==

From time to time, laity of the Orthodox Church in communion with the Patriarch of Constantinople have been granted the title of &quot;archon&quot; to honor their service to Church administration. In 1963, archons in the United States were organized into a service society, the Order of St. Andrew. This archon status is not part of the Church hierarchy and is purely honorary.

An archon is an honoree by His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, for his outstanding service to the Church, and a well-known, distinguished, and well-respected leader of the Orthodox Church (at large).

It is the sworn oath of the archon to defend and promote the Orthodox Church faith and tradition. His main concern is to protect and promote the Holy Patriarchate and its mission. He is also concerned with human rights and the well-being and general welfare of the Church.

As it is a significant religious position, the faith and dedication of a candidate for the role are extensively reviewed during consideration; the candidate should have demonstrated commitment for the betterment of the Church, Parish-Diocese, Archdiocese and the community as a whole.

==Other uses==
&quot;Archon&quot; is used in Modern Greek colloquially, as (&quot;archontas)&quot;, for someone that holds a form of status or power, and the Arab-speaking Copts use it in church parlance in the form as a title for a leading member of the laity. Archon was the title of Great Officers of Sicily. It can also be used as a title in fraternities and sororities.

In Gnostic religious traditions, the term &quot;archon&quot; generally refers to a group of seven supernatural beings, associated with the seven classical planets and considered to be responsible for the creation of the physical world.

<text>In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple threads and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. Semaphores are a type of synchronization primitive. A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example, incremented or decremented, or toggled) depending on programmer-defined conditions.

A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in a real-world system is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available, coupled with operations to adjust that record &quot;safely&quot; (i.e., to avoid race conditions) as units are acquired or become free, and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes available. 

Though semaphores are useful for preventing race conditions, they do not guarantee their absence. Semaphores that allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, while semaphores that are restricted to the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks.

The semaphore concept was invented by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1962 or 1963, when Dijkstra and his team were developing an operating system for the Electrologica X8. That system eventually became known as the THE multiprogramming system.

==Library analogy==
Suppose a physical library has ten identical study rooms, to be used by one student at a time. Students must request a room from the front desk. If no rooms are free, students wait at the desk until someone relinquishes a room. When a student has finished using a room, the student must return to the desk and indicate that the room is free.

In the simplest implementation, the clerk at the front desk knows only the number of free rooms available. This requires that all of the students use their room while they have signed up for it and return it when they are done. When a student requests a room, the clerk decreases this number. When a student releases a room, the clerk increases this number. The room can be used for as long as desired, and so it is not possible to book rooms ahead of time.

In this scenario, the front desk count-holder represents a counting semaphore, the rooms are the resource, and the students represent processes/threads. The value of the semaphore in this scenario is initially 10, with all rooms empty. When a student requests a room, they are granted access, and the value of the semaphore is changed to 9. After the next student comes, it drops to 8, then 7, and so on. If someone requests a room and the current value of the semaphore is 0, they are forced to wait until a room is freed (when the count is increased from 0). If one of the rooms was released, but there are several students waiting, then any method can be used to select the one who will occupy the room (like FIFO or randomly picking one). And of course, a student must inform the clerk about releasing their room only after really leaving it.

===Important observations===
When used to control access to a pool of resources, a semaphore tracks only &quot;how many&quot; resources are free. It does not keep track of &quot;which&quot; of the resources are free. Some other mechanism (possibly involving more semaphores) may be required to select a particular free resource.

The paradigm is especially powerful because the semaphore count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions. The librarian above may turn the lights off in the study hall when there are no students remaining, or may place a sign that says the rooms are very busy when most of the rooms are occupied.

The success of the protocol requires applications to follow it correctly. Fairness and safety are likely to be compromised (which practically means a program may behave slowly, act erratically, hang, or crash) if even a single process acts incorrectly. This includes:
* requesting a resource and forgetting to release it;
* releasing a resource that was never requested;
* holding a resource for a long time without needing it;
* using a resource without requesting it first (or after releasing it).

Even if all processes follow these rules, &quot;multi-resource deadlock&quot; may still occur when there are different resources managed by different semaphores and when processes need to use more than one resource at a time, as illustrated by the dining philosophers problem.

==Semantics and implementation==
Counting semaphores are equipped with two operations, historically denoted as P and V (see for alternative names). Operation V increments the semaphore &quot;S&quot;, and operation P decrements it.

The value of the semaphore &quot;S&quot; is the number of units of the resource that are currently available. The P operation wastes time or sleeps until a resource protected by the semaphore becomes available, at which time the resource is immediately claimed. The V operation is the inverse: it makes a resource available again after the process has finished using it.
One important property of semaphore &quot;S&quot; is that its value cannot be changed except by using the V and P operations.

A simple way to understand (P) and (V) operations is:
* : Decrements the value of the semaphore variable by 1. If the new value of the semaphore variable is negative, the process executing is blocked (i.e., added to the semaphore&#x27;s queue). Otherwise, the process continues execution, having used a unit of the resource.
* : Increments the value of the semaphore variable by 1. After the increment, if the pre-increment value was negative (meaning there are processes waiting for a resource), it transfers a blocked process from the semaphore&#x27;s waiting queue to the ready queue.

Many operating systems provide efficient semaphore primitives that unblock a waiting process when the semaphore is incremented. This means that processes do not waste time checking the semaphore value unnecessarily.

The counting semaphore concept can be extended with the ability to claim or return more than one &quot;unit&quot; from the semaphore, a technique implemented in Unix. The modified V and P operations are as follows, using square brackets to indicate atomic operations, i.e., operations that appear indivisible to other processes:

 function V(semaphore S, integer I):
 [S ← S + I]
 function P(semaphore S, integer I):
 repeat:
 [if S ≥ I:
 S ← S − I
 break]

However, the rest of this section refers to semaphores with unary V and P operations, unless otherwise specified.

To avoid starvation, a semaphore has an associated queue of processes (usually with FIFO semantics). If a process performs a P operation on a semaphore that has the value zero, the process is added to the semaphore&#x27;s queue and its execution is suspended. When another process increments the semaphore by performing a V operation, and there are processes on the queue, one of them is removed from the queue and resumes execution. When processes have different priorities the queue may be ordered thereby, such that the highest priority process is taken from the queue first.

If the implementation does not ensure atomicity of the increment, decrement, and comparison operations, there is a risk of increments or decrements being forgotten, or of the semaphore value becoming negative. Atomicity may be achieved by using a machine instruction that can read, modify, and write the semaphore in a single operation. Without such a hardware instruction, an atomic operation may be synthesized by using a software mutual exclusion algorithm. On uniprocessor systems, atomic operations can be ensured by temporarily suspending preemption or disabling hardware interrupts. This approach does not work on multiprocessor systems where it is possible for two programs sharing a semaphore to run on different processors at the same time. To solve this problem in a multiprocessor system, a locking variable can be used to control access to the semaphore. The locking variable is manipulated using a test-and-set-lock command.

==Examples==

===Trivial example===
Consider a variable &quot;A&quot; and a boolean variable &quot;S&quot;. &quot;A&quot; is only accessed when &quot;S&quot; is marked true. Thus, &quot;S&quot; is a semaphore for &quot;A&quot;.

One can imagine a stoplight signal (&quot;S&quot;) just before a train station (&quot;A&quot;). In this case, if the signal is green, then one can enter the train station. If it is yellow or red (or any other color), the train station cannot be accessed.

===Login queue===
Consider a system that can only support ten users (S=10). Whenever a user logs in, P is called, decrementing the semaphore &quot;S&quot; by 1. Whenever a user logs out, V is called, incrementing &quot;S&quot; by 1 representing a login slot that has become available. When &quot;S&quot; is 0, any users wishing to log in must wait until &quot;S&quot; increases. The login request is enqueued onto a FIFO queue until a slot is freed. Mutual exclusion is used to ensure that requests are enqueued in order. Whenever &quot;S&quot; increases (login slots available), a login request is dequeued, and the user owning the request is allowed to log in. If &quot;S&quot; is already greater than 0, then login requests are immediately dequeued.

===Producer–consumer problem===

In the producer–consumer problem, one process (the producer) generates data items and another process (the consumer) receives and uses them. They communicate using a queue of maximum size &quot;N&quot; and are subject to the following conditions:
* the consumer must wait for the producer to produce something if the queue is empty;
* the producer must wait for the consumer to consume something if the queue is full.

The semaphore solution to the producer–consumer problem tracks the state of the queue with two semaphores: codice_1, the number of empty places in the queue, and codice_2, the number of elements in the queue. To maintain integrity, codice_1 may be lower (but never higher) than the actual number of empty places in the queue, and codice_2 may be lower (but never higher) than the actual number of items in the queue. Empty places and items represent two kinds of resources, empty boxes and full boxes, and the semaphores codice_1 and codice_2 maintain control over these resources.

The binary semaphore codice_7 ensures that the integrity of the state of the queue itself is not compromised, for example, by two producers attempting to add items to an empty queue simultaneously, thereby corrupting its internal state. Alternatively a mutex could be used in place of the binary semaphore.

The codice_1 is initially &quot;N&quot;, codice_2 is initially 0, and codice_7 is initially 1.

The producer does the following repeatedly:

 produce:
 P(emptyCount)
 P(useQueue)
 putItemIntoQueue(item)
 V(useQueue)
 V(fullCount)

The consumer does the following repeatedly

 consume:
 P(fullCount)
 P(useQueue)
 item ← getItemFromQueue()
 V(useQueue)
 V(emptyCount)

Below is a substantive example:
# A single consumer enters its critical section. Since codice_2 is 0, the consumer blocks.
# Several producers enter the producer critical section. No more than &quot;N&quot; producers may enter their critical section due to codice_1 constraining their entry.
# The producers, one at a time, gain access to the queue through codice_7 and deposit items in the queue.
# Once the first producer exits its critical section, codice_2 is incremented, allowing one consumer to enter its critical section.

Note that codice_1 may be much lower than the actual number of empty places in the queue, for example, where many producers have decremented it but are waiting their turn on codice_7 before filling empty places. Note that codice_17 always holds, with equality if and only if no producers or consumers are executing their critical sections.

===Passing the baton pattern===
The &quot;Passing the baton&quot; pattern proposed by Gregory R. Andrews is a generic scheme to solve many complex concurrent programming problems in which multiple processes compete for the same resource with complex access conditions (such as satisfying specific priority criteria or avoiding starvation). Given a shared resource, the pattern requires a private &quot;priv&quot; semaphore (initialized to zero) for each process (or class of processes) involved and a single mutual exclusion &quot;mutex&quot; semaphore (initialized to one). 
The pseudo-code for each process is:
void process(int proc_id, int res_id)
 resource_acquire(proc_id, res_id);
 &lt;use the resource res_id&gt;;
 resource_release(proc_id, res_id);


The pseudo-code of the resource acquisition and release primitives are:
void resource_acquire(int proc_id, int res_id)
 P(mutex);
 if(&lt;the condition to access res_id is not verified for proc_id&gt;)
 &lt;indicate that proc_id is suspended for res_id&gt;;
 V(mutex);
 P(priv[proc_id]);
 &lt;indicate that proc_id is not suspended for res_id anymore&gt;;
 
 &lt;indicate that proc_id is accessing the resource&gt;;
 pass_the_baton(); // See below

void resource_release(int proc_id, int res_id)
 P(mutex);
 &lt;indicate that proc_id is not accessing the resource res_id anymore&gt;;
 pass_the_baton(); // See below


Both primitives in turn use the &quot;pass_the_baton&quot; method, whose pseudo-code is:
void pass_the_baton(int res_id)
 if &lt;the condition to access res_id is true for at least one suspended process&gt;
 int p = &lt;choose the process to wake&gt;;
 V(priv[p]);
 else
 V(mutex);
}
Remarks

The pattern is called &quot;passing the baton&quot; because a process that releases the resource as well as a freshly reactivated process will activate at most one suspended process, that is, shall &quot;pass the baton to it&quot;. The mutex is released only when a process is going to suspend itself (resource_acquire), or when pass_the_baton is unable to reactivate another suspended process.

==Operation names==
The canonical names V and P come from the initials of Dutch words. V is generally explained as &quot;verhogen&quot; (&quot;increase&quot;). Several explanations have been offered for P, including &quot;proberen&quot; (&quot;to test&quot; or &quot;to try&quot;), &quot;passeren&quot; (&quot;pass&quot;), and &quot;pakken&quot; (&quot;grab&quot;). Dijkstra&#x27;s earliest paper on the subject gives &quot;passering&quot; (&quot;passing&quot;) as the meaning for &quot;P&quot;, and &quot;vrijgave&quot; (&quot;release&quot;) as the meaning for V. It also mentions that the terminology is taken from that used in railroad signals. Dijkstra subsequently wrote that he intended &quot;P&quot; to stand for &quot;prolaag&quot;, short for &quot;probeer te verlagen&quot;, literally &quot;try to reduce&quot;, or to parallel the terms used in the other case, &quot;try to decrease&quot;.

In ALGOL 68, the Linux kernel, and in some English textbooks, the &quot;V&quot; and &quot;P&quot; operations are called, respectively, &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;. In software engineering practice, they are often called &quot;signal&quot; and &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;release&quot; and &quot;acquire&quot; (standard Java library), or &quot;post&quot; and &quot;pend&quot;. Some texts call them &quot;vacate&quot; and &quot;procure&quot; to match the original Dutch initials.

==Semaphores vs. mutexes==
A mutex is a locking mechanism that sometimes uses the same basic implementation as the binary semaphore. However, they differ in how they are used. While a binary semaphore may be colloquially referred to as a mutex, a true mutex has a more specific use-case and definition, in that only the task that locked the mutex is supposed to unlock it. This constraint aims to handle some potential problems of using semaphores:
# Priority inversion: If the mutex knows who locked it and is supposed to unlock it, it is possible to promote the priority of that task whenever a higher-priority task starts waiting on the mutex.
# Premature task termination: Mutexes may also provide deletion safety, where the task holding the mutex cannot be accidentally deleted. 
# Termination deadlock: If a mutex-holding task terminates for any reason, the OS can release the mutex and signal waiting tasks of this condition.
# Recursion deadlock: a task is allowed to lock a reentrant mutex multiple times as it unlocks it an equal number of times.
# Accidental release: An error is raised on the release of the mutex if the releasing task is not its owner.

<text>Vicenç Montoliu i Massana, better known as Tete Montoliu (28 March 1933 – 24 August 1997) was a Spanish jazz pianist from Catalonia, Spain. Born blind, he learnt braille music at age seven. His styles varied from hard bop, through Afro-Cuban, world fusion, to post bop. He recorded with Lionel Hampton in 1956 and played with saxophonist Roland Kirk in 1963. He also worked with leading American jazz musicians who toured in, or relocated to Europe including Kenny Dorham, Dexter Gordon, Ben Webster, Lucky Thompson, and Anthony Braxton. Tete Montoliu recorded two albums in the US, and recorded for Enja, SteepleChase Records, and Soul Note in Europe.

==Biography==
Montoliu was born blind, in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Spain, and died in the same city. He was the only son of Vicenç Montoliu (a professional musician) and Àngela Massana, a jazz enthusiast, who encouraged her son to study piano. Montoliu&#x27;s earliest piano teaching took place under the tutelage of Enric Mas at the private school for blind children he attended from 1939 to 1944. In 1944, Montoliu&#x27;s mother arranged for Petri Palou to provide him with formal piano lessons.

From 1946 to 1953, Montoliu studied music at the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu in Barcelona, where he also met jazz musicians and became familiar with the idiom in jam sessions. During the early stages of his career, Montoliu was particularly influenced by the music of U.S. jazz pianist Art Tatum, although he soon developed his own style. (Coincidentally, Tatum was also impaired with extremely limited vision). Montoliu began playing professionally at pubs in Barcelona, where he was noticed by Lionel Hampton on 13 March 1956. Montoliu toured with Hampton through Spain and France and recorded &quot;Jazz Flamenco&quot;.

In 1967, Montoliu performed in New York City with bassist Richard Davis and drummer Elvin Jones. Two concerts at the Village Gate in April were recorded for the Impulse! label, but an album was never released. He frequently appeared in Madrid during the 1960s at the Whiskey Jazz Club with musicians Pedro Iturralde and singer Donna Hightower. During the 1970s, Montoliu travelled extensively throughout Europe. During the 1980s, he performed in concerts with musicians such as Dexter Gordon, Johnny Griffin, George Coleman, Joe Henderson, Dizzy Gillespie, Chick Corea, Hank Jones, Roy Hargrove, Idris Muhammad, Herbie Lewis and Jesse Davis, among others.

In 1996, shortly before his death a year later, Spain paid public tribute to Montoliu for his 50-year career in jazz.

He died in August 1997 from lung cancer, at the age of 64.

<doc id="164561" wikidata="Q211277" url="?curid=164561" title="The Mamas &amp; the Papas">
<text>The Mamas &amp; the Papas were an American folk rock vocal group that recorded and performed from 1965 to 1968, with a brief reunion in 1971. The group was a defining force in the music scene of the counterculture of the 1960s. Formed in New York City, the group consisted of Americans John Phillips, Cass Elliot, Michelle Phillips, and Canadian Denny Doherty. Their sound was based on vocal harmonies arranged by John Phillips – the songwriter and leader of the group – who adapted folk to the new beat style of the early 1960s.

The Mamas &amp; the Papas released five studio albums and 17 singles, six of which made the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10, and has sold close to 40 million records worldwide. After their break-up in 1968, the band reunited briefly to record the album &quot;People Like Us&quot; in 1971 but split again shortly after the album was released. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 for their contributions to the music industry, and they reunited for the second and final time to perform at the induction ceremony that year, during which Elliot&#x27;s daughter Owen filled in for her late mother, who had died in 1974.

==History==

=== 1965: Formation and beginnings ===
The Mamas &amp; the Papas was formed by the husband and wife John Phillips (formerly of the Journeymen) and Michelle Phillips, along with Denny Doherty (formerly of the Mugwumps). Both of these earlier acts were folk groups active in 1964 and 1965. The last member to join was Cass Elliot, Doherty&#x27;s bandmate in the Mugwumps, who had to overcome John Phillips&#x27;s concerns that her voice was too low for his arrangements, that her obesity would be an obstacle to the band&#x27;s success, and that her temperament was incompatible with his (Elliot struggled with obesity all her life and felt deeply insecure about her physical appearance). The group considered calling itself the Magic Cyrcle before switching to the Mamas &amp; the Papas, inspired by the Hells Angels, whose female associates were called &quot;mamas&quot;.

The quartet spent the period from early spring to midsummer 1965 in the Virgin Islands &quot;to rehearse and just put everything together&quot;, as John Phillips later recalled. Phillips acknowledged that he was reluctant to abandon folk music. Others, including Doherty and guitarist Eric Hord, have said he hung on to it &quot;like death&quot;. Roger McGuinn&#x27;s view is that &quot;[i]t was hard for John to break out of folk music because I think he was really good at it, conservative, and successful, too.&quot; Phillips also acknowledged that it was Doherty and Elliot who awakened him to the potential of contemporary pop, as epitomized by the Beatles. Previously the New Journeymen had played acoustic folk with banjo, and the Mugwumps played something closer to folk rock, with bass and drums. The rehearsals in the Virgin Islands were &quot;the first time that we tried playing electric&quot;.

The band then traveled from New York to Los Angeles for an audition with Lou Adler, co-owner of Dunhill Records. The audition was arranged by Barry McGuire, who had befriended Cass Elliot and John Phillips independently during the previous two years and who had recently signed with Dunhill. The audition led to &quot;a deal in which they would record two albums a year for the next five years&quot;, with a royalty of 5% on 90% of retail sales. Dunhill Records also tied the band to management and publishing deals, commonly known as a &quot;triple hat&quot; relationship. Cass Elliot&#x27;s membership was not formalized until the paperwork was signed, with Adler, Michelle Phillips and Doherty overruling John Phillips.

The Mamas &amp; the Papas made their first recording singing background vocals on McGuire&#x27;s album &quot;This Precious Time&quot;, although they had already released a single of their own by the time the album appeared in December 1965. The single &quot;Go Where You Wanna Go&quot;, which was given a limited release in November, failed to chart. The follow-up, &quot;California Dreamin, has the same B-side, suggesting that &quot;Go Where You Wanna Go&quot; had been withdrawn. &quot;California Dreamin was released in December, touted by a full-page advertisement in &quot;Billboard&quot; on December 18. It peaked at No. 4 in the United States and No. 23 in the United Kingdom. &quot;Go Where You Wanna Go&quot; was covered by the 5th Dimension on its album &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot; and became a Top 10 hit.

=== 1966–1967: &quot;If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears&quot; and &quot;The Mamas &amp; the Papas&quot; ===
The quartet&#x27;s debut album, &quot;If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears&quot;, followed in February 1966 and became its only No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The third and final single from the album, &quot;Monday, Monday&quot;, was released in March 1966. It became the band&#x27;s only No. 1 hit in the US, reached No. 3 in the UK, and was the first No. 1 on Spain&#x27;s Los 40 Principales. &quot;Monday, Monday&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1967. It was also nominated for Best Performance by a Vocal Group, Best Contemporary Song and Record of the Year.
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Mamas &amp; the Papas&quot;, is sometimes referred to as &quot;Cass, John, Michelle, Dennie&quot;, whose names appear above the band&#x27;s name on the cover, including the unexplained misspelling of Doherty&#x27;s first name. The recording was interrupted when Michelle Phillips became indiscreet about her affair with Gene Clark of the Byrds. A liaison between Michelle and Denny Doherty had already been forgiven by her husband, John Phillips; Doherty and John Phillips co-wrote &quot;I Saw Her Again&quot; about the affair. They later disagreed about how much Doherty contributed to the song. Following Michelle&#x27;s affair with Clark, John Phillips was determined to fire her. He told her she was fired on her birthday, June4, 1966, though she disputed whether he had the authority to do so. After consulting their attorney and record label, John, Elliot, and Doherty served Michelle with a letter expelling her from the group three weeks later.

Jill Gibson was hired to replace Michelle. Gibson was a visual artist and singer-songwriter who had recorded with Jan and Dean. After being introduced to the band by its producer, Lou Adler, Gibson soon took part in concerts in Forest Hills (New York City), Denver, Colorado, and Phoenix, Arizona; television appearances including &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; on ABC; and recording sessions. While Gibson was a quick study and well-regarded, the three original members concluded she lacked her predecessor&#x27;s &quot;stage charisma and grittier edge&quot;, and Michelle Phillips was reinstated on August 23, 1966. Jill Gibson left the band and was paid a lump sum from the group&#x27;s funds.

&quot;The Mamas &amp; the Papas&quot; peaked at No. 4 in the US and No. 24 in the UK, continuing the band&#x27;s success. &quot;I Saw Her Again&quot; was released as a single in June 1966 and reached No. 5 in the US and No. 11 in the UK. There is a false start to the final chorus of the song at 2&#x27;42&quot;. While mixing the record, Bones Howe inadvertently punched in the coda vocals too early. He then rewound the tape and inserted the vocals in their proper position. On playback, the mistaken early entry could still be heard, making it sound as though Doherty repeated the first three words, singing &quot;I saw her...I saw her again last night&quot;. Lou Adler liked the effect, and told Howe to leave it in the final mix. &quot;That has to be a mistake: nobody&#x27;s that clever&quot;, Paul McCartney told the group. The device was imitated by John Sebastian in the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful song &quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot; (1966), and by Kenny Loggins in the song &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot; (1980). &quot;Words of Love&quot; was the second single from the album, released in November 1966 as a double A-side with &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;. The record reached No. 5 in the US. &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, which had been a hit two years earlier for Martha and the Vandellas, struggled to No. 73. In the UK it was backed with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; and peaked at No. 47.

With Michelle Phillips reinstated, the group embarked on a small tour on the East Coast to promote the record in the fall of 1966. Their co-headlining band was &quot;Webster&#x27;s New Word&quot;, two members being Gus Duffy and Jim Mason. At a September 1966 concert at Fordham University in New York City, Duffy and Mason both noted that the group was clearly &quot;high, drunk, or tripping. When they got on stage, it was clear that these people shouldn&#x27;t be on stage ... They tumbled onto the stage, shambled around, and just got nowhere&quot;.

=== 1967–1968: &quot;The Mamas &amp; the Papas Deliver&quot; and &quot;The Papas &amp; the Mamas&quot; ===

After completing their East Coast tour, the group started work immediately on its third album, &quot;The Mamas &amp; The Papas Deliver&quot;, which was recorded in the autumn of 1966. The first single from the album, &quot;Look Through My Window&quot;, was released in September 1966 before the last single from &quot;The Mamas &amp; the Papas&quot;. It reached No. 24 in the US. The second single, &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot;, released in February 1967, did better, peaking at No. 2 in both the US and the UK. The success of &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot; helped the album, which was also released in February 1967, reach No. 2. The third single, &quot;Creeque Alley&quot;, released April 1967, chronicled the band&#x27;s early history and reached No. 5 in the US.

By June 1967, the strain on the group was apparent when it performed indifferently at the Monterey International Pop Festival. The band was under-rehearsed, partly because John and Michelle Phillips and Lou Adler were preoccupied with organizing the festival, partly because Doherty arrived at the last minute from another sojourn in the Virgin Islands, and partly because he was drinking heavily in the aftermath of his affair with Michelle Phillips. The Mamas &amp; the Papas rallied for its performance before 18,000 people at the Hollywood Bowl in August with Jimi Hendrix as the opener, which John and Michelle Phillips remembered as the apex of the band&#x27;s career, saying, &quot;There would never be anything quite like it again&quot;.

&quot;The Mamas &amp; the Papas Deliver&quot; was followed in October 1967 by the non-album single &quot;Glad to Be Unhappy&quot;, which reached No. 26 in the US. &quot;Dancing Bear&quot; from the group&#x27;s second album was released as a single in November. It peaked at No. 51 in the US. Neither &quot;Glad to Be Unhappy&quot; nor &quot;Dancing Bear&quot; charted in the UK.

The Mamas &amp; the Papas cut their first three albums at United Western Recorders in Hollywood, while the group&#x27;s subsequent releases were recorded at the eight-track studio that John and Michelle Phillips had built at their home in Bel Air, at a time when four-track recording was still the norm. John Phillips said, &quot;I got the idea to transform the attic into my own recording studio, so I could stay high all the time and never have to worry about studio time. I began assembling the state-of-the-art equipment and ran the cost up to about a hundred grand&quot;.

While having his own studio gave John Phillips the autonomy he craved, it also removed the external discipline that may have been beneficial to a man who described himself as an &quot;obsessive perfectionist&quot;. Doherty, Elliot and Adler found the arrangement uncongenial. Elliot complained to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on October 26, 1968, &quot;We spent one whole month on one song; just the vocals for &#x27;The Love of Ivy&#x27; took one whole month. I did my [debut solo] album in three weeks, a total of ten days in the studio. Live with the band, not prerecorded tracks sitting there with earphones.&quot; The recording sessions for the fourth album stalled, and in September 1967 John Phillips called a press conference to announce that the Mamas &amp; the Papas were taking a break, which the band confirmed on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; that aired on September 24.

The Mamas &amp; the Papas planned to give concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Olympia in Paris before taking time out on Majorca to &quot;get the muse going again&quot;. When the group docked at Southampton on October 5, Elliot was arrested for stealing two blankets and a hotel key worth 10 guineas ($28) when in England the previous February. Elliot was transferred to London, where she spent a night in custody after being strip-searched, before the case was dismissed in the West London Magistrates&#x27; Court the next day. The hotel was less interested in the blankets than in an unpaid bill. Elliot had entrusted the money to her companion, Harris Pickens &quot;Pic&quot; Dawson III, who neglected to settle the account. The police were less interested in the blankets or the bill than in Dawson, who was suspected of international drug trafficking and was the sole subject of their questioning.

Later, at a party hosted by the band to celebrate Elliot&#x27;s acquittal, John Phillips interrupted Elliot as she was telling the Rolling Stones&#x27; Mick Jagger about her arrest and trial and said, &quot;Mick, she&#x27;s got it all wrong, that&#x27;s not how it was at all.&quot; Elliot screamed at Phillips and stormed out of the room. Elliot was ready to quit, the Royal Albert Hall and Olympia dates were canceled, and the four went their separate ways. John and Michelle Phillips went to Morocco, Doherty returned to the United States, and Elliot went either to the United States (according to John Phillips) or to a rendezvous in Paris with Pic Dawson (according to Michelle Phillips). In an interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Elliot unilaterally announced that the Mamas &amp; the Papas had disbanded, saying &quot;We thought this trip would give the group some stimulation, but this has not been so.&quot;

=== 1968–1971: &quot;People Like Us&quot; and break-up ===
John Phillips and Elliot reconciled to complete &quot;The Papas &amp; The Mamas&quot;, which was released in May 1968. The album was the band&#x27;s first album not to go gold or reach the top 10 in America. &quot;Twelve Thirty (Young Girls Are Coming to the Canyon)&quot; was released as a single in August 1967 and peaked at No. 20 in the US. After the second single, &quot;Safe in My Garden&quot; (May 1968), made it only to No. 53, Dunhill Records released Elliot&#x27;s solo from the album, a remake of &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot;, as a single credited to &quot;Mama Cass with the Mamas &amp; the Papas&quot; in June 1968, against John Phillips&#x27; wishes. The song reached No. 12 in the US and No. 11 in the UK, making &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; the only single by the Mamas &amp; Papas to chart higher in the UK than in the US. The fourth and final single from &quot;The Papas &amp; The Mamas&quot;, &quot;For the Love of Ivy&quot; (July 1968), peaked at No. 81 in the US. For the second time, Dunhill Records returned to the band&#x27;s earlier work for a single, releasing &quot;Do You Wanna Dance&quot; from the debut album in October 1968. The song reached No. 76 in the US.

The success of &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; confirmed Elliot&#x27;s desire to embark on a solo career, and by the end of 1968 it appeared that the group had split. John Phillips recalled, &quot;Times had changed. The Beatles showed the way. Music itself was heading toward a technological and compositional complexity that would leave many of us behind. It was tough to keep up.&quot; The group met its demise officially in early 1969, as John Phillips recalled, saying &quot;Dunhill released us from our contracts and we were history, though we still owed the label another album.&quot; Elliot, billed as Mama Cass, had released her solo debut &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; in 1968, Phillips released &quot;John Phillips (John, the Wolf King of L.A.)&quot; in 1970, and Denny Doherty followed with &quot;Watcha Gonna Do?&quot; in 1971.

Dunhill Records maintained momentum by releasing &quot;Farewell to the First Golden Era&quot; in 1967, &quot;Golden Era Vol. 2&quot; in 1968, &quot;16 of Their Greatest Hits&quot; in 1969 and the Monterey live album in 1970. The record company was determined to get the band&#x27;s contractually obligated last album, for which it had given the band an extension until September 1971. The label warned the band that each member would be sued for $250,000 if the band did not deliver the album. A lawsuit and countersuit between the band and label were settled out of court, and it was determined that the band would record under John Phillips&#x27;s label, Warlock Records, distributed by Dunhill Records. John Phillips wrote a collection of songs, which was arranged, rehearsed, and recorded throughout the year, depending on the availability of the other group members. Band members were rarely together at one time and most tracks were dubbed, one vocal at a time.

The Mamas &amp; the Papas&#x27; last album of new material, &quot;People Like Us&quot;, was released in November 1971. The only single, &quot;Step Out&quot;, reached No. 81 in the US. The album peaked at No. 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the only album by the Mamas &amp; Papas not to reach the top 20 in the US. Neither single nor album charted in the UK. Contractual obligations fulfilled, the band&#x27;s split was final.

=== Post-breakup ===
In 1986, John and Michelle Phillips were featured in the music video for the Beach Boys&#x27; second recording of &quot;California Dreamin, which appeared on the album &quot;Made in U.S.&quot; Denny Doherty was unavailable to participate. The Mamas &amp; the Papas&#x27; own version of &quot;California Dreamin was reissued in the UK and peaked at No. 9 in 1997. The song received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2001.

==== Cass Elliot ====

Cass Elliot had a successful solo career, touring the US and Europe. She appeared frequently on television, including in two specials, &quot;The Mama Cass Television Program&quot; on ABC in January 1969 and &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Mama Anymore&quot; on CBS in September 1973. She recorded hits such as &quot;Make Your Own Kind of Music&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Better&quot; but never surpassed her two Dunhill Records albums, &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; (1968) and &quot;Bubblegum, Lemonade, and ... Something for Mama&quot; (1969). Elliot signed with RCA Records, but none of the three albums she recorded for the label, &quot;Cass Elliot&quot;, &quot;The Road Is No Place for a Lady&quot; (both 1972), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Mama Anymore&quot; (1973), produced a charting single.

Elliot died of heart failure in London on July 29, 1974, after completing a two-week engagement at the Palladium. The shows were mostly sold out, and prompted standing ovations. Her former bandmates and Lou Adler attended her funeral in Los Angeles. Elliot was survived by her only child, Owen Vanessa Elliot, who was born in 1967.

==== John Phillips ====

John Phillips&#x27;s country-influenced solo album, &quot;John Phillips (John, the Wolf King of L.A.)&quot;, enjoyed critical favor but was not a commercial success, despite featuring the single &quot;Mississippi&quot;, which reached No. 32 in the US. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album four stars when it was reissued in 2006, calling it &quot;a genuine lost treasure&quot;. Denny Doherty said that if the Mamas &amp; the Papas had recorded the album, it might have been their best. John Phillips wrote songs for the soundtrack to &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; (Robert Altman, 1970) and original music for the soundtracks to &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (Michael Sarne, 1970) and &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; (Nicolas Roeg, 1976). He also wrote the ill-fated stage musical &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; (1975). John Phillips wrote most of the tracks on the album &quot;Romance Is on the Rise&quot; (1974) by his then wife Geneviève Waïte, which he also produced, and he co-wrote &quot;Kokomo&quot; (1988), which was a No. 1 hit for the Beach Boys.

Phillips was lost in a heroin addiction through much of the 1970s, a period that included his arrest and conviction in 1980 on a charge of conspiring to distribute narcotics for which he spent a month in jail in 1981. In later years, he performed with the New Mamas and the Papas and appeared in revival shows and television specials. He told his side of the Mamas &amp; Papas story in the memoir &quot;Papa John&quot; (1986), and in the PBS television documentary, &quot;Straight Shooter: The True Story of John Phillips and the Mamas and the Papas&quot; (1988). Phillips died of heart failure in Los Angeles on March 18, 2001.

Two albums were released immediately after his death, &quot;Pay Pack &amp; Follow&quot; (April 2001), which included material recorded in London and New York with members of the Rolling Stones in 1976 and 1977, and &quot;Phillips 66&quot; (August 2001), an album of new material and reworkings that took its title from the age Phillips would have been when the album was originally slated for its release. A later archival series on Varèse Sarabande included a reissue of &quot;John Phillips (John, the Wolf King of L.A.)&quot; with bonus tracks (2006), sessions he recorded for Columbia with the Crusaders in 1972 and 1973 released as &quot;Jack of Diamonds&quot; (2007), his preferred mix of the Rolling Stones sessions released with other material as &quot;Pussycat&quot; (2008), and his demos for &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; released as &quot;Andy Warhol Presents Man on the Moon: The John Phillips Space Musical&quot; (2009).

==== Denny Doherty ====

Denny Doherty&#x27;s solo career faltered after the appearance of &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do?&quot; in 1971. The follow-up, &quot;Waiting for a Song&quot; (1974), was not released in the US, although a 2001 reissue by Varèse Sarabande gained wider distribution and is now available as a digital download. The album features Michelle Phillips and Cass Elliot as background vocalists in what was to be Elliot&#x27;s last recorded performance. A single from the album, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;, made the adult contemporary charts. Doherty turned to the stage, making a disastrous start in John Phillips&#x27;s &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; (1975). In 1977, he returned to his birthplace, Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he played Shakespeare at the Neptune Theatre under the tutelage of John Neville. This led to television work, including a variety program, &quot;Denny&#x27;s Sho&quot;, which ran for one season in 1978. Doherty hosted and voiced parts in the children&#x27;s program &quot;Theodore Tugboat&quot;, and acted in various series, including 22 episodes of the drama &quot;Pit Pony&quot;. He also performed with the New Mamas and the Papas (see below). An alcoholic through the 1960s and 1970s, he recovered in the early 1980s and stayed sober for the remainder of his life. In 1996, he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.

Doherty answered John Phillips&#x27;s PBS documentary with the autobiographical stage musical &quot;Dream a Little Dream (the Nearly True Story of the Mamas &amp; the Papas)&quot; which he wrote with Paul Ledoux and performed in Halifax in 1997 and the off-Broadway Village Theater in New York in 2003. The original cast recording, featuring Doherty and supporting band, was released by Lewlacow in 1999. Doherty died on January 19, 2007, at his home in Mississauga, Ontario, from kidney failure, following surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

==== Michelle Phillips ====

While Michelle Phillips&#x27;s only solo album, &quot;Victim of Romance&quot; (1977), made little impact, she went on to build a successful career as an actress. Her film credits include &quot;The Last Movie&quot; (1971), &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973), &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977), &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1979), &quot;The Man with Bogart&#x27;s Face&quot; (1980), &quot;American Anthem&quot; (1986), &quot;Let It Ride&quot; (1989) and &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; (1993). Her television credits include &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Hotel,&quot; &quot;Knots Landing,&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.

Michelle Phillips published a memoir, &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;,&quot; in 1986, the same year John Phillips published his. Reading the two books together was, according to one reviewer, &quot;like reading the transcripts in a divorce trial&quot;. As the co-writer and owner of the copyright to &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, Michelle Phillips was an important contributor to the 2005 PBS television documentary &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;: The Songs of the Mamas &amp; the Papas&quot;. As of 2025, she is the last surviving member of the band&#x27;s original lineup.

== The New Mamas &amp; the Papas ==
The New Mamas &amp; the Papas was a by-product of John Phillips&#x27;s desire to &quot;round out the picture of reform&quot; as he awaited sentencing on narcotics charges in 1980. He invited his children Jeffrey and Mackenzie, and Denny Doherty, to join him at the Fair Oaks Hospital in Summit, New Jersey, where he was undergoing rehabilitation. The idea of reviving the Mamas &amp; the Papas was born at this time, with John Phillips and Doherty in their original roles, Mackenzie Phillips taking Michelle Phillips&#x27;s part and Elaine &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarlane of Spanky and Our Gang taking the part of Cass Elliot. Little progress was made until after Phillips served his time in jail. The quartet began rehearsing in earnest and recording demos in the summer of 1981. The band&#x27;s first performance was in March 1982, when it was praised for its verve and expertise, the impressive precision of the harmonies, and the &quot;feeling ... of genuine celebration&quot; on stage.

The group toured the United States, including residencies in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, but lost $150,000 in its first 18 months. John Phillips called a halt in August 1983 and the New Mamas &amp; the Papas did not perform again until February 1985. The band resumed touring, with concerts in Europe, East Asia, South America, Canada and the United States. At the height of the New Mamas &amp; the Papas, the group was playing up to 280 nights a year. John Phillips stayed off heroin, but he and his daughter remained addicted to alcohol, cocaine and pills. The addictions affected the group&#x27;s performance, as it was occasionally booed off stage.

Doherty quit the band in 1987 and was replaced by Scott McKenzie (1939–2012). In 1991 Mackenzie Phillips was formally replaced by Laurie Beebe Lewis, a former vocalist with the Buckinghams. Lewis, who sang with the band from October 1986 through April 1987, replaced MacKenzie Phillips intermittently between 1987 and 1991 while she was pregnant, in drug rehab and dealing with personal issues. John Phillips dropped out of the band after a liver transplant in 1992 and Doherty returned. Lewis and McFarlane left in 1993 and were replaced by Lisa Brescia and Deb Lyons. The band continued to perform with varying lineups, including Barry McGuire and the recovering John Phillips, until 1998, by which time &quot;the jingle singers who sang those fabulous Cass, Michelle, John, and Denny parts were an aural cartoon&quot;. In 1998 the lineup was John Phillips, Scott McKenzie, Chrissy Faith, David Baker and Janelle Sadler. After John Phillips and McKenzie retired permanently from touring, Mark Williamson was brought in.

John Phillips wanted the New Mamas &amp; the Papas to make an album, but could not commit to it. Varèse Sarabande released the 1981 demos with other material as &quot;Many Mamas, Many Papas&quot; in 2010. After 2010, the band is represented on record by live albums including &quot;The Mamas &amp; the Papas Reunion Live&quot; (1987) featuring the Phillips–Doherty–Phillips–McFarlane lineup and released by Teichiku in Japan, and &quot;Dreamin&#x27; Live&quot; (2005) on Legacy (not the Columbia–Sony imprint) which features John and Mackenzie Phillips, Spanky McFarlane and (probably) Scott McKenzie.

==Legacy==
The Mamas &amp; the Papas was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2009. Cass Elliot and Michelle Phillips, as &quot;the Mamas&quot;, were ranked No. 21 on the VH1 network&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Women of Rock.

The band received a box set when the four-CD &quot;Complete Anthology&quot; was released in the UK in September 2004 and in the US in January 2005. It contains the five studio albums, the live album from Monterey, selections from their solo work and rarities including their first sessions with Barry McGuire.

The Mamas &amp; the Papas is the subject of several documentaries, including &quot;Straight Shooter&quot;, &quot;California Dreamin″&quot; and &quot;Here I Am&quot;, Doherty&#x27;s musical, Doug Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Mamas &amp; the Papas: California Dreamin″&quot; (2000) and Matthew Greenwald&#x27;s &quot;Go Where You Wanna Go: The Oral History of the Mamas &amp; the Papas&quot; (2002). Cass Elliot is the subject of Jon Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Make Your Own Kind of Music: A Career Retrospective of Cass Elliot&quot; (1987) and Eddi Fiegel&#x27;s &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me: The Life of Mama Cass Elliot&quot; (2005). Chris Campion authored &quot;Wolfking&quot;, a biography of John Phillips that was authorized by the John Phillips Estate.

Fox acquired the rights to make a film about the Mamas &amp; the Papas in 2000. It was reported in 2007 that &quot;The right script is in the process of being written.&quot; Peter Fitzpatrick&#x27;s stage musical, &quot;Flowerchildren: The Mamas &amp; Papas Story&quot;, was produced by Magnormos in Melbourne, Australia, in 2011 and revived in 2013.

Their song &quot;California Dreamin features prominently in the 1994 Hong Kong comedy–drama movie &quot;Chungking Express&quot;.

On March 20, 2019, &quot;Straight Shooter&quot; by the Mamas &amp; the Papas was featured on the soundtrack and trailer for &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (stylized as &quot;Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood&quot;), a black comedy feature film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Michelle Phillips and Cass Elliot are both minor characters in the film. &quot;Twelve Thirty&quot;, another song by the group, was used in the film but not featured on the soundtrack.

<text>A value-added reseller (VAR) is a company that adds features or services to an existing product, then resells it (usually to end-users) as an integrated or complete &quot;turn-key&quot; product. This practice occurs commonly in the electronics or IT industry, where, for example, a VAR might bundle a software application with supplied hardware.

The added value can come from professional services such as integrating, customizing, consulting, training and implementation. The value can also be added by developing a specific application for the product designed for the customer&#x27;s needs which is then resold as a new package. VARs incorporate platform software into their own software product packages.

The term is often used in the computer industry, where a company purchases computer components and builds (for example) a fully operational personal computer system usually customized for a specific task (such as non-linear video editing). By doing this, the company has added value above the cost of the individual computer components. Customers would purchase the system from the reseller if they lacked the time or experience to assemble the system themselves. Tandy Corporation was an example of a company that sold products through VARs, using relabeled versions of its computers.

<text>In the physical sciences, the wavenumber (or wave number), also known as repetency, is the spatial frequency of a wave. Ordinary wavenumber is defined as the number of wave cycles divided by length; it is a physical quantity with dimension of reciprocal length, expressed in SI units of cycles per metre or reciprocal metre (m−1). Angular wavenumber, defined as the wave phase divided by time, is a quantity with dimension of angle per length and SI units of radians per metre. They are analogous to temporal frequency, respectively the &quot;ordinary frequency&quot;, defined as the number of wave cycles divided by time (in cycles per second or reciprocal seconds), and the &quot;angular frequency&quot;, defined as the phase angle divided by time (in radians per second).

In multidimensional systems, the wavenumber is the magnitude of the &quot;wave vector&quot;. The space of wave vectors is called &quot;reciprocal space&quot;. Wave numbers and wave vectors play an essential role in optics and the physics of wave scattering, such as X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, electron diffraction, and elementary particle physics. For quantum mechanical waves, the wavenumber multiplied by the reduced Planck constant is the &quot;canonical momentum&quot;.

Wavenumber can be used to specify quantities other than spatial frequency. For example, in optical spectroscopy, it is often used as a unit of temporal frequency assuming a certain speed of light.

== Definition ==
Wavenumber, as used in spectroscopy and most chemistry fields, is defined as the number of wavelengths per unit distance, typically centimeters (cm−1): 
: formula_1
where &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength. It is sometimes called the &quot;spectroscopic wavenumber&quot;. It equals the spatial frequency.

For example, a wavenumber in inverse centimeters can be converted to a frequency expressed in the unit gigahertz by multiplying by (the speed of light, in centimeters per nanosecond); conversely, an electromagnetic wave at 29.9792458 GHz has a wavelength of 1 cm in free space.

In theoretical physics, a wave number, defined as the number of radians per unit distance, sometimes called &quot;angular wavenumber&quot;, is more often used:
: formula_2

When wavenumber is represented by the symbol , a frequency is still being represented, albeit indirectly. As described in the spectroscopy section, this is done through the relationship
formula_3
where s is a frequency expressed in the unit hertz. This is done for convenience as frequencies tend to be very large.

Wavenumber has dimensions of reciprocal length, so its SI unit is the reciprocal of meters (m−1). In spectroscopy it is usual to give wavenumbers in cgs unit (i.e., reciprocal centimeters; cm−1); in this context, the wavenumber was formerly called the &quot;kayser&quot;, after Heinrich Kayser (some older scientific papers used this unit, abbreviated as &quot;K&quot;, where 1K = 1cm−1). The angular wavenumber may be expressed in the unit radian per meter (rad⋅m−1), or as above, since the radian is dimensionless.

For electromagnetic radiation in vacuum, wavenumber is directly proportional to frequency and to photon energy. Because of this, wavenumbers are used as a convenient unit of energy in spectroscopy.

=== Complex ===
A complex-valued wavenumber can be defined for a medium with complex-valued relative permittivity formula_4, relative permeability formula_5 and refraction index &quot;n&quot; as:
: formula_6
where &quot;k&quot;0 is the free-space wavenumber, as above. The imaginary part of the wavenumber expresses attenuation per unit distance and is useful in the study of exponentially decaying evanescent fields.

=== Plane waves in linear media ===
The propagation factor of a sinusoidal plane wave propagating in the positive x direction in a linear material is given by
: formula_7
where
* formula_8
* formula_9 phase constant in the units of radians/meter
* formula_10 attenuation constant in the units of nepers/meter
* formula_11 angular frequency
* formula_12 distance traveled in the &quot;x&quot; direction
* formula_13 conductivity in Siemens/meter
* formula_14 complex permittivity
* formula_15 complex permeability
* formula_16

The sign convention is chosen for consistency with propagation in lossy media. If the attenuation constant is positive, then the wave amplitude decreases as the wave propagates in the x-direction.

Wavelength, phase velocity, and skin depth have simple relationships to the components of the wavenumber:
: formula_17

== In wave equations ==
Here we assume that the wave is regular in the sense that the different quantities describing the wave such as the wavelength, frequency and thus the wavenumber are constants. See wavepacket for discussion of the case when these quantities are not constant.

In general, the angular wavenumber &quot;k&quot; (i.e. the magnitude of the wave vector) is given by
: formula_18
where &quot;ν&quot; is the frequency of the wave, &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength, &quot;ω&quot; = 2&quot;πν&quot; is the angular frequency of the wave, and &quot;v&quot;p is the phase velocity of the wave. The dependence of the wavenumber on the frequency (or more commonly the frequency on the wavenumber) is known as a dispersion relation.

For the special case of an electromagnetic wave in a vacuum, in which the wave propagates at the speed of light, &quot;k&quot; is given by:
: formula_19
where &quot;E&quot; is the energy of the wave, &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in a vacuum.

For the special case of a matter wave, for example an electron wave, in the non-relativistic approximation (in the case of a free particle, that is, the particle has no potential energy):
: formula_20
Here &quot;p&quot; is the momentum of the particle, &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the particle, &quot;E&quot; is the kinetic energy of the particle, and &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant.

Wavenumber is also used to define the group velocity.

== In spectroscopy ==
In spectroscopy, &quot;wavenumber&quot; formula_21 (in reciprocal centimeters, cm−1) refers to a temporal frequency (in hertz) which has been divided by the speed of light in vacuum (usually in centimeters per second, cm⋅s−1):
: formula_22
The historical reason for using this spectroscopic wavenumber rather than frequency is that it is a convenient unit when studying atomic spectra by counting fringes per cm with an interferometer : the spectroscopic wavenumber is the reciprocal of the wavelength of light in vacuum:
: formula_23
which remains essentially the same in air, and so the spectroscopic wavenumber is directly related to the angles of light scattered from diffraction gratings and the distance between fringes in interferometers, when those instruments are operated in air or vacuum. Such wavenumbers were first used in the calculations of Johannes Rydberg in the 1880s. The Rydberg–Ritz combination principle of 1908 was also formulated in terms of wavenumbers. A few years later spectral lines could be understood in quantum theory as differences between energy levels, energy being proportional to wavenumber, or frequency. However, spectroscopic data kept being tabulated in terms of spectroscopic wavenumber rather than frequency or energy.

For example, the spectroscopic wavenumbers of the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula:
: formula_24
where &quot;R&quot; is the Rydberg constant, and &quot;n&quot;i and &quot;n&quot;f are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final levels respectively (&quot;n&quot;i is greater than &quot;n&quot;f for emission).

A spectroscopic wavenumber can be converted into energy per photon &quot;E&quot; by Planck&#x27;s relation:
: formula_25
It can also be converted into wavelength of light:
: formula_26
where &quot;n&quot; is the refractive index of the medium. Note that the wavelength of light changes as it passes through different media, however, the spectroscopic wavenumber (i.e., frequency) remains constant.

Often spatial frequencies are stated by some authors &quot;in wavenumbers&quot;, incorrectly transferring the name of the quantity to the CGS unit cm−1 itself.

<text>An atmospheric waveguide is an atmospheric flow feature that improves the propagation of certain atmospheric waves.

The effect arises because wave parameters such as group velocity or vertical wavenumber depend on mean flow direction and strength. Thus, for instance, westerlies might be a good waveguide for eastward-traveling waves, but might strongly dissipate westward-traveling waves, by increasing or decreasing their vertical wavenumber, respectively. Modification of the waves&#x27; group velocity will change their meridional propagation speed, directing them more polewards or more equatorwards.

<text>In thermodynamics, dissipation is the result of an irreversible process that affects a thermodynamic system. In a dissipative process, energy (internal, bulk flow kinetic, or system potential) transforms from an initial form to a final form, where the capacity of the final form to do thermodynamic work is less than that of the initial form. For example, transfer of energy as heat is dissipative because it is a transfer of energy other than by thermodynamic work or by transfer of matter, and spreads previously concentrated energy. Following the second law of thermodynamics, in conduction and radiation from one body to another, the entropy varies with temperature (reduces the capacity of the combination of the two bodies to do work), but never decreases in an isolated system.

In mechanical engineering, dissipation is the irreversible conversion of mechanical energy into thermal energy with an associated increase in entropy.

Processes with defined local temperature produce entropy at a certain rate. The entropy production rate times local temperature gives the dissipated power. Important examples of irreversible processes are: heat flow through a thermal resistance, fluid flow through a flow resistance, diffusion (mixing), chemical reactions, and electric current flow through an electrical resistance (Joule heating).
== Definition ==
Dissipative thermodynamic processes are essentially irreversible because they produce entropy. Planck regarded friction as the prime example of an irreversible thermodynamic process. In a process in which the temperature is locally continuously defined, the local density of rate of entropy production times local temperature gives the local density of dissipated power.

A particular occurrence of a dissipative process cannot be described by a single individual Hamiltonian formalism. A dissipative process requires a collection of admissible individual Hamiltonian descriptions, exactly which one describes the actual particular occurrence of the process of interest being unknown. This includes friction and hammering, and all similar forces that result in decoherency of energy—that is, conversion of coherent or directed energy flow into an indirected or more isotropic distribution of energy.

=== Energy ===
&quot;The conversion of mechanical energy into heat is called energy dissipation.&quot; – &quot;François Roddier&quot; The term is also applied to the loss of energy due to generation of unwanted heat in electric and electronic circuits.

=== Computational physics ===
In computational physics, numerical dissipation (also known as &quot;Numerical diffusion&quot;) refers to certain side-effects that may occur as a result of a numerical solution to a differential equation. When the pure advection equation, which is free of dissipation, is solved by a numerical approximation method, the energy of the initial wave may be reduced in a way analogous to a diffusional process. Such a method is said to contain &#x27;dissipation&#x27;. In some cases, &quot;artificial dissipation&quot; is intentionally added to improve the numerical stability characteristics of the solution.

=== Mathematics ===
A formal, mathematical definition of dissipation, as commonly used in the mathematical study of measure-preserving dynamical systems, is given in the article &quot;wandering set&quot;.

== Examples ==

=== In hydraulic engineering ===
Dissipation is the process of converting mechanical energy of downward-flowing water into thermal and acoustical energy. Various devices are designed in stream beds to reduce the kinetic energy of flowing waters to reduce their erosive potential on banks and river bottoms. Very often, these devices look like small waterfalls or cascades, where water flows vertically or over riprap to lose some of its kinetic energy.

=== Irreversible processes ===
Important examples of irreversible processes are: 
# Heat flow through a thermal resistance
# Fluid flow through a flow resistance
# Diffusion (mixing)
# Chemical reactions
# Electrical current flow through an electrical resistance (Joule heating).

=== Waves or oscillations ===
Waves or oscillations, lose energy over time, typically from friction or turbulence. In many cases, the &quot;lost&quot; energy raises the temperature of the system. For example, a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate. The precise nature of the effects depends on the nature of the wave: an atmospheric wave, for instance, may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass, and at higher levels due to radiative cooling.

== History ==

The concept of dissipation was introduced in the field of thermodynamics by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1852. Lord Kelvin deduced that a subset of the above-mentioned irreversible dissipative processes will occur unless a process is governed by a &quot;perfect thermodynamic engine&quot;. The processes that Lord Kelvin identified were friction, diffusion, conduction of heat and the absorption of light.

<text>Orography is the study of the topographic relief of mountains, and can more broadly include hills, and any part of a region&#x27;s elevated terrain. Orography (also known as &quot;oreography&quot;, &quot;orology,&quot; or &quot;oreology&quot;) falls within the broader discipline of geomorphology. The term orography comes from the Greek: , hill, , to write.

==Uses==
Mountain ranges and elevated land masses have a major impact on global climate. For instance, the elevated areas of East Africa substantially determine the strength of the Indian monsoon. In scientific models, such as general circulation models, orography defines the lower boundary of the model over land.

When a river&#x27;s tributaries or settlements by the river are listed in &#x27;orographic sequence&#x27;, they are in order from the highest (nearest the source of the river) to the lowest or mainstem (nearest the mouth). This method of listing tributaries is similar to the Strahler Stream Order, where the headwater tributaries are listed as category 1.

==Orographic precipitation==

Orographic precipitation, also known as relief precipitation, is precipitation generated by a forced upward movement of air upon encountering a physiographic upland (see anabatic wind). This lifting can be caused by:

# Upward deflection of large-scale horizontal flow by the orography.
# Anabatic or upward vertical propagation of moist air up an orographic slope, caused by daytime heating of the mountain barrier surface.

Upon ascent, the air that is being lifted expands and cools adiabatically. This adiabatic cooling of a rising moist air parcel may lower its temperature to its dew point, thus allowing for condensation of the water vapor contained within it, and hence the formation of a cloud. If enough water vapor condenses into cloud droplets, these droplets may become large enough to fall to the ground as precipitation.

Terrain-induced precipitation is a major factor for meteorologists to consider when they forecast the local weather. Orography can play a major role in determining the type, amount, intensity, and duration of precipitation events. Researchers have discovered that barrier width, slope steepness, and updraft speed are major contributors when it comes to achieving the optimal amount and intensity of orographic precipitation. Computer models simulating these factors have shown that narrow barriers and steeper slopes produce stronger updraft speeds, which in turn increase orographic precipitation.

Orographic precipitation is known to occur on oceanic islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand; much of the rainfall received on such islands is on the windward side, and the leeward side tends to be quite dry, almost desert-like. This phenomenon results in substantial local gradients in the amount of average rainfall, with coastal areas receiving on the order of per year, and interior uplands receiving over per year. Leeward coastal areas are especially dry—less than per year at Waikiki—and the tops of moderately high uplands are especially wet—about per year at Wai&#x27;ale&#x27;ale on Kaua&#x27;i.

Another area in which orographic precipitation is known to occur is the Pennines in the north of England: the west side of the Pennines receives more rain than the east because the clouds are forced up and over the hills and cause the rain to tend to fall on the western slopes. This is particularly noticeable between Manchester (to the west) and Leeds (to the east); Leeds receives less rain due to a rain shadow of from the Pennines.

<text>Charles Weedon Westover (December 30, 1934 – February 8, 1990), better known by his stage name Del Shannon, was an American musician, singer and songwriter, best known for his 1961 number-one &quot;Billboard&quot; hit &quot;Runaway&quot;. In 1999, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to his music career, he had minor acting roles.

==Biography==
Shannon was born Charles Weedon Westover on December 30, 1934, in Coopersville, Michigan, to Bert and Leone Mosher Westover. He learned to play the ukulele and guitar and listened to country-and-western music by artists such as Hank Williams, Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell. He was drafted into the Army in 1954 and, while in Germany, played guitar in a band called The Cool Flames. When his service ended, he returned to Battle Creek, Michigan, and worked as a carpet salesman and as a truck driver for a furniture factory. He found part-time work as a rhythm guitarist in singer Doug DeMott&#x27;s group, The Moonlight Ramblers, working at the Hi-Lo Club.

When DeMott was fired in 1958 for drunkenness, Westover took over as leader and singer, giving himself the name Charlie Johnson and renaming the band the Big Little Show Band. In early 1959 he added the keyboardist Max Crook, who played an instrument he called a Musitron (an early synthesizer of Crook&#x27;s own invention, though modeled on the commercially released Clavioline). Crook had made recordings, and he persuaded Ann Arbor disc jockey Ollie McLaughlin to listen to the band. McLaughlin took the group&#x27;s demos to Harry Balk and Irving Micahnik of Talent Artists in Detroit. In July 1960, Westover and Crook signed to become recording artists and composers for Bigtop Records. Balk suggested Westover use a new name, and they came up with &quot;Del Shannon&quot;, combining Mark Shannon—a wrestling pseudonym used by a regular at the Hi-Lo Club—with Del, derived from the Cadillac Coupe de Ville, his favorite car.

===Success===

He flew to New York City, but his first sessions were not successful. McLaughlin then persuaded Shannon and Crook to rewrite and re-record one of their earlier songs, originally called &quot;Little Runaway&quot;, using the Musitron as lead instrument. On January 21, 1961, they recorded &quot;Runaway&quot;, which was released as a single in February 1961, reaching number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in April. Shannon followed with &quot;Hats Off to Larry&quot;, which peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and number 2 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; chart in 1961, and the less popular &quot;So Long, Baby&quot;, another song of breakup bitterness. &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Hats Off to Larry&quot; were recorded in a day.

===Berlee Records and Amy Records===
By August 1963, Shannon&#x27;s relationship with his managers and Bigtop had soured, so he formed his own label, Berlee Records, named after his parents.

He returned to the charts immediately with &quot;Handy Man&quot; (a 1960 hit by Jimmy Jones), &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; (a 1958 hit by Bobby Freeman), and two originals, &quot;Keep Searchin&#x27;&quot; (number 3 in the UK; number 9 in the U.S.), and &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; (number 40 in the UK). In late 1964, Shannon produced a demo recording session for a young fellow Michigander named Bob Seger, who would go on to stardom much later. Shannon gave acetates of the session to Dick Clark (he had performed in one of Clark&#x27;s tours, in 1965) and, by 1966, Seger was recording for Philadelphia&#x27;s famed Cameo Records, resulting in some regional hits, which eventually led to a deal with a major label, Capitol Records. Also in late 1964, Shannon paid tribute to one of his own musical idols with &quot;Del Shannon Sings Hank Williams&quot; (Amy Records 8004). The album was recorded in hard-core country honky-tonk style, and no singles were released. Shannon opened for Ike and Tina Turner at Dave Hull&#x27;s Hullabaloo club in Los Angeles, California, on December 22, 1965.

===Liberty Records, United Artists Records and Island Records===
Shannon signed with Liberty in 1966 and revived Toni Fisher&#x27;s &quot;The Big Hurt&quot; and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;. Peter and Gordon released his song &quot;I Go to Pieces&quot; in 1965.

In September 1967, Shannon began laying down the tracks for &quot;The Further Adventures of Charles Westover&quot;, which was highly regarded by fans and critics alike despite disappointing sales. The album yielded two 1968 singles, &quot;Thinkin&#x27; It Over&quot; and &quot;Gemini&quot;. In October 1968, Liberty Records released their tenth (in the United States) and final Shannon single, a cover of Dee Clark&#x27;s 1961 hit &quot;Raindrops&quot;. This brought to a close a commercially disappointing period in Shannon&#x27;s career. In 1972, he signed with United Artists and recorded &quot;Live in England&quot;, released in June 1973. Reviewer Chris Martin critiqued the album favourably, saying that Shannon never improvised, was always true to the original sounds of his music and that only Lou Christie rivaled his falsetto. In April 1975, he signed with Island Records.

After he and his manager jointly sought back royalties for Shannon, Bug Music was founded in 1975 to administer his songs. By 2011, when Bug was acquired by BMG Rights Management, its catalogue had grown to include 250,000 compositions.

A 1976 article on Shannon&#x27;s concert at the Roxy Theatre described the singer as &quot;personal, pure and simple rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, dated but gratifyingly undiluted.&quot; Shannon sang some of his new rock songs along with classics like &quot;Endless Sleep&quot; and &quot;The Big Hurt&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Shannon&#x27;s haunting vignettes of heartbreak and restlessness contain something of a cosmic undercurrent which has the protagonist tragically doomed to a bleak, shadowy struggle.&quot;

===Later career===
Shannon&#x27;s career slowed down greatly in the 1970s, owing in part to his alcoholism. The Welsh rock singer Dave Edmunds produced the single &quot;And the Music Plays On&quot; in 1974. In 1978 Shannon stopped drinking and began work on &quot;Sea of Love&quot;, released in 1982 on his album &quot;Drop Down and Get Me&quot;, produced by Tom Petty. The album took two years to record and featured Petty&#x27;s band, the Heartbreakers, backing Shannon. However, RSO Records, to which Shannon was signed, folded. Further work on the LP was done for Network Records (distributed by Elektra Records). Seven songs are Shannon originals with covers of songs recorded by the Everly Brothers, the Rolling Stones, and Frankie Ford, along with &quot;Sea of Love&quot; by Phil Phillips. It was Shannon&#x27;s first album in eight years.

In February 1982, Shannon appeared at the Bottom Line. He performed pop-rock tunes and old hits. Stephen Holden, a reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described an &quot;easygoing pop-country&quot; style. On &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Keep Searchin&#x27;&quot;, Shannon and his band rediscovered the sound &quot;in which his keen falsetto played off against airy organ obbligatos.&quot; In the 1980s, Shannon performed &quot;competent but mundane country-rock&quot;.

Shannon had a resurgence of popularity after re-recording &quot;Runaway&quot; with new lyrics as the theme for the NBC-TV program &quot;Crime Story&quot;. In 1988, Shannon sang &quot;The World We Know&quot; with the Smithereens on their album &quot;Green Thoughts&quot;. Two years later, he recorded with Jeff Lynne of the Electric Light Orchestra, and there were rumors he would join the Traveling Wilburys after the death of Roy Orbison. Previously, in 1975, Shannon had recorded tracks with Lynne, along with &quot;In My Arms Again&quot;, a country song he wrote and recorded for Warner Bros. Records, which had signed Shannon in 1984.

==Death and legacy==
In January 1990, Shannon was pushing himself to finish a new album and schedule upcoming concerts, resulting in troublesome stress. On the advice of his doctor, on January 24, Shannon began taking Prozac, an antidepressant. Fifteen days later, he died by suicide, shooting himself with a .22 caliber rifle at his home in Santa Clarita, California, on February 8, 1990. &quot;He was very much in charge of his business, but within days after he started taking Prozac I noticed a personality change in him. He developed severe insomnia, extreme fatigue, chills, racing heart, dry mouth, and upset stomach,&quot; testified LeAnne Westover, Shannon&#x27;s widow. &quot;Suicide was totally out of character for my husband. There was no note and no goodbye.&quot;

Following his death, the Wilburys honored him by recording a version of &quot;Runaway&quot;. Jeff Lynne also co-produced Shannon&#x27;s posthumous album, &quot;Rock On&quot;, released by Silvertone Records in 1991.

Shannon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 and into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005.

A Del Shannon Memorial Scholarship Fund was set up following Shannon&#x27;s death. Coopersville, Michigan, holds an annual Del Shannon Car Show.

<text>Jamesetta Hawkins (January 25, 1938 – January 20, 2012), known professionally as Etta James, was an American singer and songwriter. Starting her career in 1954, James frequently performed in Nashville&#x27;s famed R&amp;B clubs, collectively known as the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit, in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1970s. She sang in various genres, including gospel, blues, jazz, R&amp;B, rock and roll, and soul, and gained fame with hits such as &quot;The Wallflower&quot; (1957), &quot;At Last&quot; (1960), &quot;Something&#x27;s Got a Hold on Me&quot; (1962), &quot;Tell Mama&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Blind&quot; (both 1977). She faced a number of personal problems, including heroin addiction, severe physical abuse, and incarceration, before making a musical comeback in the late 1980s with the album &quot;Seven Year Itch&quot; (1988).

James&#x27;s deep and earthy voice is considered to have bridged the gap between R&amp;B and rock and roll. She won fifteen Grammy Awards for her albums (2005 - Best Traditional Blues Album for &quot;Blues to the Bone&quot;; 2004 - Best Contemporary Blues Album for &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot;; and 1995 - Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female for &quot;Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday&quot;) and 17 Blues Music Awards. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999, and the Blues Hall of Fame in 2001. She also received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked James number 22 on its 2008 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;; she was also ranked number 62 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2015 list of the &quot;35 Greatest R&amp;B Artists of All Time&quot; also included James, whose &quot;gutsy, take-no-prisoner vocals colorfully interpreted everything from blues and R&amp;B/soul to rock n’roll, jazz and gospel.&quot; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame named her &quot;one of the greatest voices of her century&quot; and &quot;forever the matriarch of blues.&quot;

==Life and career==
==1938–1959: Childhood and career beginnings==
Jamesetta Hawkins was born on January 25, 1938, in Los Angeles, California, to Dorothy Hawkins, who was 14 at the time. Although her father has never been identified, James speculated that she was the daughter of pool player Rudolf &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot; Wanderone, whom she met briefly in 1987. Her mother was frequently absent from their apartment in Watts, conducting relationships with various men, and James lived with a series of foster parents, most notably &quot;Sarge&quot; and &quot;Mama&quot; Lu. James referred to her mother as &quot;the Mystery Lady&quot;. James was raised by relatives and friends during her childhood, and she began regularly attending a Baptist church while in the care of her grandparents.

James received her first professional vocal training at the age of five from James Earle Hines, musical director of the Echoes of Eden choir at the St. Paul Baptist Church in South-Central Los Angeles. She became a soloist in the choir despite her young age and performed with them on local radio stations. She quickly gained attention for having a strong voice for a child. Hines often punched her in the chest while she sang to force her voice to come from her gut.

Sarge, like the musical director for the choir, was also abusive. During drunken poker games at home, he would awaken James in the early morning hours and force her with beatings to sing for his friends. The trauma of her foster father forcing her to sing under these humiliating circumstances caused her to have difficulties with singing on demand throughout her career.

In 1950, Mama Lu died, and James&#x27;s biological mother took her to the Fillmore district of San Francisco. Within a couple of years, she began listening to doo-wop and was inspired to form a girl group, the Creolettes (so named for the members&#x27; light-skinned complexions).

At the age of 14, she met musician Johnny Otis. Stories on how they met vary. In Otis&#x27;s version, she came to his hotel after one of his performances in the city and persuaded him to audition her. Another story was that Otis spotted the Creolettes performing at a Los Angeles nightclub and sought for them to record his &quot;answer song&quot; to Hank Ballard&#x27;s &quot;Work with Me, Annie&quot;. Otis took the Creolettes under his wing and helped them sign to Modern Records, at which point they changed their name to Peaches. At this time Otis also gave James her stage name, transposing &quot;Jamesetta&quot; (her given first name) into &quot;Etta James.&quot; In 1954, James recorded and was credited as co-author for &quot;The Wallflower&quot; (a title change to the aforementioned song, &quot;Work with Me, Annie&quot;), which was released in early 1955. The original title of the song was actually &quot;Roll with Me, Henry&quot;, but it had been changed to avoid censorship at the time (&quot;roll&quot; implying sexual activity). In February 1955, the song reached number one on the Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues Tracks chart. Its success also gave the Peaches an opening spot on Little Richard&#x27;s national tour.

While James was on tour with Richard, pop singer Georgia Gibbs recorded a version of her song and released it under the again-altered title &quot;Dance With Me, Henry.&quot; It became a crossover hit, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which angered James.

After leaving the Peaches, James had another R&amp;B hit with &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Daddy&quot; but struggled with follow-ups. When her contract with Modern came up for renewal in 1960, she signed a contract with Chess Records instead, with which she would go on to become one of the label&#x27;s earliest stars. Around this time, she became involved in a relationship with the singer Harvey Fuqua, the founder of the doo-wop group the Moonglows.

Musician Bobby Murray toured with James for over 20 years. He wrote that James had her first hit single when she was 15 years old and went steady with B.B. King when she was 16. James believed that King&#x27;s hit single &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; was about her. In early 1955, she and an aspiring singer, the 19-year-old Elvis Presley, then recording for Sun Studios and an avid fan of King&#x27;s, shared a bill in a large club just outside Memphis. In her autobiography, she noted how impressed she was with the young singer&#x27;s manners. She also recalled how happy he made her many years later when she found out that it was Presley who had moved her close friend Jackie Wilson from a substandard convalescent home to a more appropriate facility and, as she put it, paid all the expenses. Presley died a year later. Wilson went on to live for another ten years in the care center Presley found for him.

==1960–1978: Chess and Warner Bros. year==
James&#x27; first hit singles with Fuqua were &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot; and &quot;Spoonful&quot;. Her first solo hit was the doo-wop–styled rhythm-and-blues song &quot;All I Could Do Was Cry&quot;, which was a number two R&amp;B hit. Chess Records co-founder Leonard Chess envisioned James as a classic ballad stylist who had potential to cross over to the pop charts and soon surrounded the singer with violins and other string instruments. The first string-laden ballad James recorded was &quot;My Dearest Darling&quot; in May 1960, which peaked in the top five of the R&amp;B chart. James sang background vocals for her labelmate Chuck Berry on his &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot;

Her debut album, &quot;At Last!&quot;, was released in late 1960 and was noted for its varied selection of music, from jazz standards to blues to doo-wop and rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). The album included the future classics &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot; and &quot;A Sunday Kind of Love&quot;. In early 1961, James released what was to become her signature song, &quot;At Last&quot;, a Glenn Miller tune, which reached number two on the R&amp;B chart and number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Though the record was not as successful as expected, her rendition has become the best-known version of the song. James followed this with &quot;Trust in Me&quot;, which also included string instruments. Later that same year (1960), James released a second studio album, &quot;The Second Time Around&quot;. The album took the same direction as her first, covering jazz and pop standards and with strings on many of the songs. It produced two hit singles, &quot;Fool That I Am&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Baby&quot;.

James started adding gospel elements in her music the following year, releasing &quot;Something&#x27;s Got a Hold on Me&quot;, which peaked at number four on the R&amp;B chart and was a Top 40 pop hit. That success was quickly followed by &quot;Stop the Wedding&quot;, which reached number six on the R&amp;B chart and also had gospel elements. In 1963, she had another major hit with &quot;Pushover&quot; and released the live album &quot;Etta James Rocks the House&quot;, recorded at the New Era Club in Nashville, Tennessee. After a couple of years of minor hits, James&#x27;s career started to suffer after 1965. After a period of isolation, she returned to recording in 1967 and reemerged with more gutsy R&amp;B numbers thanks to her recording at the legendary FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. These sessions yielded her comeback hit &quot;Tell Mama&quot;, co-written by Clarence Carter, which reached number ten on the R&amp;B chart and number twenty-three for pop. An album of the same name was also released that year and included her take on Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Security&quot;. The B-side of &quot;Tell Mama&quot; was &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Blind&quot;, which became a blues classic and has been recorded by many other artists. In her autobiography, &quot;Rage to Survive&quot;, she wrote that she heard the song outlined by her friend Ellington &quot;Fugi&quot; Jordan when she visited him in prison. According to her account, she wrote the rest of the song with Jordan but for tax reasons gave her songwriting credit to her partner at the time, Billy Foster.

Following this success, James became an in-demand concert performer, though she never again reached the heyday of her early to mid-1960s success. Her records continued to chart in the R&amp;B Top 40 in the early 1970s, with singles such as &quot;Losers Weepers&quot; (1970) and &quot;I Found a Love&quot; (1972). Though James continued to record for Chess, she was devastated by the death of record executive Leonard Chess in 1969. James ventured into rock and funk with the release of her self-titled album in 1973, with production from the famed rock producer Gabriel Mekler, who had worked with Steppenwolf and Janis Joplin. Joplin had admired James and had covered &quot;Tell Mama&quot; in concert. James&#x27; 1973 album, exhibiting a mixture of musical styles, was nominated for a Grammy Award. The album did not produce any major hits, however, and neither did the follow-up album, &quot;Come a Little Closer&quot;, in 1974, though, like &#x27;73&#x27;s &quot;Etta James&quot; before it, the album was also critically acclaimed.

In 1975, James opened up for comedian Richard Pryor at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles.

James continued to record for Chess (now owned by All Platinum Records), releasing one more album in 1976, &quot;Etta Is Betta Than Evvah!&quot; Her 1978 album &quot;Deep in the Night&quot;, produced by Jerry Wexler for Warner Bros., incorporated more rock-based music in her repertoire. That same year, James was the opening act for the Rolling Stones and performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Following this brief success, however, she left Chess Records and did not record for another ten years while she struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism.

==1982–1998: Continued performances and return to recording==

Amid her hiatus from recording, James still performed on occasion through the early and mid-1980s, including two guest appearances at Grateful Dead concerts in December 1982. and was a guest on John Mayall&#x27;s Blues Breakers 1982 reunion show in New Jersey. In 1984, she contacted David Wolper and asked to perform in the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics, at which she sang &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;. In 1987, she performed &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; with Chuck Berry in the documentary film &quot;Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

In 1989, she signed with Island Records and with them released the albums &quot;Seven Year Itch&quot; and &quot;Stickin&#x27; to My Guns&quot;, both of which were produced by Barry Beckett and recorded at FAME Studios. Also in 1989 James was filmed in a concert at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles with Joe Walsh and Albert Collins for the film &quot;Jazzvisions: Jump the Blues Away&quot;. Many of the backing musicians were top-flight players from Los Angeles: Rick Rosas (bass), Michael Huey (drums), Ed Sanford (Hammond B3 organ), Kip Noble (piano) and Josh Sklair, James&#x27; longtime guitar player.

James participated with the rap singer Def Jef on the song &quot;Droppin&#x27; Rhymes on Drums&quot;, which mixed James&#x27;s jazz vocals with hip-hop. In 1992, she recorded the album &quot;The Right Time&quot;, produced by Jerry Wexler for Elektra Records. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.

James signed with Private Music Records in 1993 and recorded a Billie Holiday tribute album, &quot;Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday&quot;. The album set a trend of incorporating more jazz elements in James&#x27;s music. The album won James her first Grammy Award, for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female, in 1994. In 1995, her autobiography, &quot;Rage to Survive&quot;, co-written with David Ritz, was published. Also in 1995, she recorded the album &quot;Time After Time&quot;. A Christmas album, &quot;12 Songs of Christmas&quot;, was released in 1998.

By the mid-1990s, James&#x27;s earlier music—by now considered classic—was being used in commercials, including &quot;I Just Wanna Make Love to You&quot;, for example. After an excerpt of that song was featured in a Diet Coke advertising campaign in the UK, the song again charted, reaching the top ten on the UK charts in 1996.

By 1998, with the release of &quot;Life, Love &amp; the Blues&quot;, James had added as backing musicians her own sons, Donto and Sametto, on drums and bass, respectively. They were part of her touring band. She continued recording for Private Music, which released the blues album &quot;Matriarch of the Blues&quot; in 2000, on which she returned to her R&amp;B roots.

==2001–2011: Later years and legacy==
In 2001, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the latter for her contributions to the developments of both rock and roll and rockabilly. In 2003, she received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. On her 2004 release, &quot;Blue Gardenia&quot;, she returned to a jazz style. Her final album for Private Music, &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot;, released in 2005, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked her number 62 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

James performed at the top jazz festivals in the world, such as the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1977, 1989, 1990 and 1993. She performed nine times at the legendary Monterey Jazz Festival and five times at the San Francisco Jazz Festival. She performed at the Playboy Jazz Festival in 1990, 1997, 2004, and 2007. She performed six times at the North Sea Jazz Festival, in 1978, 1982, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1993. She performed at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival in 2006 and 2009 (prior 2012 credit - after date of death). She also often performed at free summer arts festivals throughout the United States.

In 2008, James was portrayed by singer Beyoncé in the film &quot;Cadillac Records&quot;, a fictional account of Chess Records, James&#x27;s label for 18 years, about how label founder and producer Leonard Chess helped the careers of James and others. The film included &quot;At Last,&quot; performed by Beyoncé. Beyoncé was invited to perform the song at Barack Obama&#x27;s inaugural ball. In the following weeks James publicly complained that Beyoncé was “singing my song,” but later added that her critical remarks were meant to be received as a joke and stemmed from personal hurt over not having been invited to the sing the song herself for the Obama inauguration. It was later reported that Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and &quot;drug-induced dementia&quot; had contributed to her negative comments about Knowles.

In April 2009, at the age of 71, James made her final television appearance, performing &quot;At Last&quot; on the program &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. In May 2009, she received the Soul/Blues Female Artist of the Year award from the Blues Foundation, the ninth time she won that award. She carried on touring but by 2010 had to cancel concert dates because of her gradually failing health; by this time she was suffering from dementia and leukemia. In November 2011, James released her final album, &quot;The Dreamer&quot;, to critical acclaim. She announced her retirement at the time of its release.

James&#x27; enduring relevance was affirmed in 2011 when the Swedish DJ Avicii achieved substantial chart success with the song &quot;Levels&quot;, which samples her 1962 song &quot;Something&#x27;s Got a Hold on Me&quot;. The same sample was used by the east coast rapper Flo Rida in his 2011 hit single &quot;Good Feeling&quot;. Both artists issued statements of condolence upon James&#x27;s death. James&#x27; original classic music again charted after these 21st-century re-interpretations.

==Style and influence==
James possessed the vocal range of a contralto. Her musical style changed during the course of her career. At the beginning of her recording career, in the mid-1950s, James was marketed as an R&amp;B and doo-wop singer. After signing with Chess Records in 1960, James broke through as a traditional pop-styled singer, covering jazz and pop music standards on her debut album, &quot;At Last!&quot; James&#x27;s voice deepened and coarsened, moving her musical style in her later years into the genres of soul and jazz.

James was once considered one of the most overlooked blues and R&amp;B musicians in the music history of the United States. It was not until the early 1990s, when she began receiving major industry awards from the Grammys and the Blues Foundation, that she received wide recognition. In more recent years, she has been hailed as a pioneer who helped bridge the gap between rhythm and blues and rock and roll and thereby contributed significantly to American musical history. James has influenced a wide variety of musicians, including, notably, Diana Ross, Christina Aguilera, Janis Joplin, Brandy, Bonnie Raitt, Shemekia Copeland, Beth Hart, Hayley Williams of Paramore and Brent Smith of Shinedown as well as British artists The Rolling Stones, Elkie Brooks, Paloma Faith, Joss Stone, Rita Ora, Amy Winehouse, and Adele, and the Belgian singer Dani Klein.

In particular, her song &quot;Something&#x27;s Got a Hold on Me&quot; has been recognized in many ways. Brussels music act Vaya Con Dios covered the song on their 1990 album &quot;Night Owls&quot;. Another version, performed by Christina Aguilera, was in the 2010 film &quot;Burlesque&quot;. Pretty Lights sampled the song in &quot;Finally Moving&quot;, followed by Avicii&#x27;s dance hit &quot;Levels&quot;, and again in Flo Rida&#x27;s single &quot;Good Feeling&quot;.

British blues band Chicken Shack recorded Etta James’ 1967 single &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Blind&quot;, which ended up becoming very successful for the band, with Christine McVie singing lead vocals. The single was successful enough that it garnered Christine McVie the Top Female Singer on the Melody Maker&#x27;s Reader&#x27;s Poll in 1969.

==Personal life==
==Religion==
Through her mother, Dorothy, James was introduced to the Nation of Islam. Dorothy attended occasional meetings at Nation of Islam Temple No. 27 in Los Angeles, and relayed the teachings to her daughter. Under the care of her grandparents, however, James was raised Baptist. In her adult years, James and a friend began attending a Nation of Islam temple in Atlanta, where she found comfort in the preaching of Minister Louis X and a sense of &quot;racial pride&quot;. She took on the name &quot;Jamesetta X&quot; and later joined Malcolm X’s temple in Harlem; she remained a member for about a decade. It was in Harlem that James became friends with young boxer Cassius Clay, who later changed his name to Muhammad Ali. She didn&#x27;t strictly follow their beliefs, saying it was &quot;something of a fad&quot; and the &quot;radical, the &#x27;in&#x27; thing to do&quot; at the time.

==Marriage and children==
James was married to Artis Mills from 1969 until her death in 2012. She had two sons, Donto James and Sametto James, born to different fathers. Both of her sons became musicians and eventually performed professionally with their mother; Donto played drums at Montreux in 1993, and Sametto played bass guitar circa 2003, among other performances and tours.

==Legal difficulties and drug addiction==
By the mid-1960s, James suffered from an addiction to heroin. To finance her habit, she bounced checks, forged prescriptions and stole from her friends. In 1966, she was arrested for writing bad checks; she was placed on probation and ordered to pay a $500 fine. In 1969, she spent 10 days in jail for violating her probation.

James was continuously in and out of rehabilitation centers, including the Tarzana Treatment Centers, in Los Angeles. Her husband, Artis Mills, accepted responsibility when they were both arrested for heroin possession, and served a 10-year prison sentence. He was released from prison in 1981.

In 1973, James was arrested for possession of heroin. In 1974, she was sentenced to drug treatment instead of prison. During this period, she became addicted to methadone and would mix her doses with heroin. She was in the Tarzana Psychiatric Hospital for 17 months, starting at the age of 36, and went through a great struggle. In her 1995 autobiography &quot;Rage to Survive&quot;, she said that the time she spent in the hospital changed her life. After leaving treatment, however, her substance abuse continued, particularly after she developed a relationship with a man who was also using drugs.

In 2010, James received treatment for a dependency on painkillers.

==Illness and death==

James was hospitalized in January 2010 to treat an infection caused by MRSA, a bacterium resistant to many antibiotics. During her hospitalization, her son Donto revealed to the public that, in 2008, she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In 2011, James was diagnosed with leukemia. Artis Mills was appointed sole conservator of the James estate and tasked with overseeing her medical care. She died on January 20, 2012, at age 73, at Riverside Community Hospital in Riverside, California. Her death came three days after that of Johnny Otis, the man who had discovered her in the 1950s. Thirty-six days after her death, her sideman Red Holloway also died.

Her funeral was presided over by the Reverend Al Sharpton and took place at Greater Bethany Community Church in Gardena, California, eight days after her death. Stevie Wonder and Christina Aguilera gave musical tributes. She was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Los Angeles County, California.

<doc id="164581" wikidata="Q4922389" url="?curid=164581" title="Maiden's Prayer">
<text>&quot;A Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (original Polish title: &quot; Op. 4, French: &quot;) is a composition of Polish composer Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska (1834–1861). It was published in 1856 in Warsaw, and then as a supplement to the &quot;Revue et gazette musicale de Paris&quot; in 1859. It is a short piano piece of medium difficulty for intermediate pianists. Some have liked it for its charming and romantic melody; others have described it as &quot;sentimental salon tosh.&quot; 

==In country music==

The American musician Bob Wills heard &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; played on a fiddle while he was a barber in Roy, New Mexico, and arranged the piece in the Western swing style. Wills first recorded it as an instrumental in 1935 (Vocalion 03924, released in 1938), and it quickly became one of his signature tunes. Later, it became a standard recorded by many country artists, including Buck Owens on his number-one 1965 album &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Tiger By the Tail&quot;. The tune is still a standard in the repertoire of Western swing bands.

Wills wrote lyrics for &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; and recorded it again in 1941 (Okeh 06205) with vocals by Tommy Duncan. His lyrics reflect the title, and the song, as written by Wills, opens with:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Twilight falls, evening shadows find,
There &#x27;neath the stars, a maiden so fair divine.
The moon on high seemed to see her there.
In her eyes is a light, shining ever so bright,
She whispered a silent prayer.&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; was released in May 1941, and quickly hit number 1 on June 28, 1941, in The Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Hillbilly and Foreign Record Hits Of the Month&quot;. 

Relatively few country singers have covered &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; with vocals, but they include Ray Price on his tribute album &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot; (1962) and Willie Nelson on his album &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; (on the 2000 CD reissue but not the 1975 LP). Both singers used the lyrics written by Wills with minor variations, e.g. the maiden is an Indian in Price&#x27;s version. Also the Everly Brothers recorded a rendition of the song in 1973.

Wills recorded the song a third time on the 1963 album &quot;Bob Wills Sings and Plays&quot;. When he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970, &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; was one of the works cited.

==In popular media==

The &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; is quoted in the 1930 opera &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht. It appears midway through act 1, played on an out-of-tune piano at a honky-tonk frequented by prostitutes and their clients. Jakob Schmidt, one of the denizens of Mahagonny, refers to the song as &quot;ewige Kunst&quot; (&quot;eternal art&quot;).

&quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; is heard off-stage in act 4 of &quot;Three Sisters&quot; by Anton Chekhov. &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; appears as an insert piano song in the anime series &quot;Strawberry Panic&quot;. &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; is played by garbage trucks in Taiwan. As residents have to take out their own trash, the garbage truck signals everyone to do so with the melody of this piece, along with Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Für Elise&quot;.

The Rodgers and Hart standard &quot;It Never Entered My Mind&quot; refers to this song in the penultimate line.

In the 1955 Italian &quot;Scandal in Sorrento&quot; film, Antonio and Violante play the tune together on a piano at the very end of the movie

In Nobuhiko Obayashi&#x27;s 1977 horror movie &quot;House&quot;, the character Melody plays the opening section of &quot;A Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; on the piano a few times.

In 1993, the North Korean Wangjaesan Dance Troupe&#x27;s VHS tape featured this song in electronic arrangement.

In the 2013 television serial &quot;The Tunnel&quot;, Anglo-French actor and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg performs a voice-over to the tune of the &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, singing a mixture of French and English:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;, closer to me, dear.
 set aside all fear.

Yes, you shall be mine till the end of time.&lt;/poem&gt;

The piece remains especially popular in Asia. In Japan, the melody of Bądarzewska&#x27;s &quot;Maiden Prayer&quot; is played when the platform door of Shinkansen bullet trains closes. In Taiwan, the Maiden&#x27;s Prayer is one of two songs that are typically played on garbage trucks, the other being Beethoven&#x27;s Für Elise.

==In literature==

The &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; was used in a macabre context in Mary Wilkins Freeman&#x27;s ghost story &quot;The Wind in the Rose-Bush&quot; (published 1903), where the main character, roused from sleep by the sound of the melody being played in a seemingly empty house, rushed downstairs to see who was at the piano, only to find that there was no one there.

==Interpretations==
&quot;A Maiden&#x27;s Prayer Op. 4&quot; by Bądarzewska is featured on Lang Lang&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Piano Book&quot; released by Deutsche Grammophon.

==Criticism==
The pianist and academic Arthur Loesser was among the critics of the piece and described it as &quot;this dowdy product of ineptitude.&quot;

<text>Gertrude &quot;Ma&quot; Rainey ( Pridgett; April 26, 1886 – December 22, 1939) was an American blues singer and influential early-blues recording artist. Dubbed the &quot;Mother of the Blues&quot;, she bridged earlier vaudeville and the authentic expression of southern blues, influencing a generation of blues singers. Rainey was known for her powerful vocal abilities, energetic disposition, majestic phrasing, and a &quot;moaning&quot; style of singing. Her qualities are present and most evident in her early recordings &quot;Bo-Weevil Blues&quot; and &quot;Moonshine Blues&quot;.

Gertrude Pridgett began performing as a teenager and became known as &quot;Ma&quot; Rainey after her marriage to Will &quot;Pa&quot; Rainey in 1904. They toured with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels and later formed their own group, &quot;Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues&quot;. Her first recording was made in 1923. In the following five years, she made over 100 recordings, including &quot;Bo-Weevil Blues&quot; (1923), &quot;Moonshine Blues&quot; (1923), &quot;See See Rider Blues&quot; (1925), the blues standard &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; (1927), and &quot;Soon This Morning&quot; (1927).

Rainey also collaborated with Thomas Dorsey, Tampa Red, and Louis Armstrong, and toured and recorded with the Georgia Jazz Band. Touring until 1935, she then largely retired from performing and continued as a theater impresario in her hometown of Columbus, Georgia, until her death four years later. She has been posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, as well as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Rainey has been portrayed in several films including the 2020 Academy Award-winning film &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot;. In 2023, she was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Early life==
There is uncertainty about the birth date of Gertrude Pridgett. Some sources indicate that she was born in 1882, while most sources assert that she was born on April 26, 1886. Pridgett claimed to have been born on April 26, 1886 (beginning with the 1910 census, taken April 25, 1910), in Columbus, Georgia. However, the 1900 census indicates that she was born in September 1882 in Alabama, and researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest that her birthplace was in Russell County, Alabama. She was the second of five children of Thomas and Ella (née Allen) Pridgett, from Alabama. She had at least two brothers and a sister, Malissa Pridgett Nix.

In February 1904, Ma Rainey married William &quot;Pa&quot; Rainey. She took on the stage name &quot;Ma Rainey&quot;, which was &quot;a play on her husband&#x27;s nickname, &#x27;Pa.

==Early career==
Pridgett began her career as a performer at a talent show in Columbus, Georgia, when she was approximately 12 to 14 years old. A member of the First African Baptist Church, she began performing in black minstrel shows. She later claimed that she was first exposed to blues music around 1902. She formed the Alabama Fun Makers Company with her husband, Will Rainey, but in 1906 they both joined Pat Chappelle&#x27;s much larger and more popular Rabbit&#x27;s Foot Company, where they were billed together as &quot;Black Face Song and Dance Comedians, Jubilee Singers [and] Cake Walkers&quot;. In 1910, she was described as &quot;Mrs. Gertrude Rainey, our coon shouter&quot;. She continued with the Rabbit&#x27;s Foot Company after it was taken over by a new owner, F. S. Wolcott, in 1912.
Rainey said she found &quot;Blues Music&quot; when she was in Missouri one night performing, and a girl introduced her to a sad song about a man leaving a woman. Rainey said she learned the lyrics of the song and added it to her performances.
Rainey claimed she created the term &quot;blues&quot; when asked what kind of song she was singing.

Beginning in 1914, the Raineys were billed as &quot;Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues&quot;. Wintering in New Orleans, she met numerous musicians, including Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet and Pops Foster. As the popularity of blues music increased, she became well known. Around this time, she met Bessie Smith, a young blues singer who was also making a name for herself. A story later developed that Rainey kidnapped Smith, forced her to join the Rabbit&#x27;s Foot Minstrels, and taught her to sing the blues; the story was disputed by Smith&#x27;s sister-in-law Maud Smith.

==Recording career==

From the late 1910s, there was an increasing demand for recordings by black musicians. In 1920, Mamie Smith was the first black woman to be recorded. In 1923, Rainey was discovered by Paramount Records producer J. Mayo Williams. She signed a recording contract with Paramount, and in December she made her first eight recordings in Chicago, including &quot;Bad Luck Blues&quot;, &quot;Bo-Weevil Blues&quot; and &quot;Moonshine Blues&quot;. She made more than 100 other recordings over the next five years, which brought her fame beyond the South. Paramount marketed her extensively, calling her the &quot;Mother of the Blues&quot;, the &quot;Songbird of the South&quot;, the &quot;Gold-Neck Woman of the Blues&quot; and the &quot;Paramount Wildcat&quot;.

In 1924, Rainey recorded with Louis Armstrong, including on &quot;Jelly Bean Blues&quot;, &quot;Countin&#x27; the Blues&quot; and &quot;See, See Rider&quot;. In the same year, she embarked on a tour of the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA) in the South and Midwest of the United States, singing for black and white audiences. She was accompanied by the bandleader and pianist Thomas Dorsey and the band he assembled, the Wildcats Jazz Band. They began their tour with an appearance in Chicago in April 1924 and continued, on and off, until 1928. Dorsey left the group in 1926 because of ill health and was replaced as pianist by Lillian Hardaway Henderson, the wife of Rainey&#x27;s cornetist Fuller Henderson, who became the band&#x27;s leader.

Although most of Rainey&#x27;s songs that mention sexuality refer to love affairs with men, some of her lyrics contain references to lesbianism or bisexuality, such as the 1928 song &quot;Prove It on Me&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;They said I do it, ain&#x27;t nobody caught me.
Sure got to prove it on me.
Went out last night with a crowd of my friends.
They must&#x27;ve been women, &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t like no men.
It&#x27;s true I wear a collar and tie.
Makes the wind blow all the while.&lt;/poem&gt;

According to the Queer Cultural Center&#x27;s website, the lyrics refer to an incident in 1925 in which Rainey was &quot;arrested for taking part in an orgy at [her] home involving women in her chorus&quot;. The political activist and scholar Angela Y. Davis noted that Prove It on Me&#x27; is a cultural precursor to the lesbian cultural movement of the 1970s, which began to crystallize around the performance and recording of lesbian-affirming songs.&quot; At the time, an ad for the song embraced the genderbending outlined in the lyrics and featured Rainey in a three-piece suit, mingling with women while a police officer lurks nearby.

Unlike many blues singers of her day, Rainey wrote at least a third of the songs she sang including many of her most famous works such as &quot;Moonshine Blues&quot; and &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; which would become standards of the &quot;classic blues&quot; genre.

Throughout the 1920s, Ma Rainey had a reputation for being one of the most dynamic performers in the United States due in large part to her songwriting, showmanship and voice. She and her band could fetch earnings of $350 a week on tour with the Theater Owners Booking Association, which was double that of Bessie Brown and George Williams while a little over half what Bessie Smith would ultimately command.

Toward the end of the 1920s, live vaudeville went into decline, being replaced by radio and recordings. Rainey&#x27;s career was t Pa Rainey adopted a son named Danny who later joined his parents&#x27; musical act. Rainey developed a relationship with Bessie Smith. They became so close that rumors circulated that their relationship was possibly also romantic in nature. It was also rumored that Smith once bailed Ma Rainey out of jail.

The Raineys separated in 1916.

In 1935, Rainey returned to her home town, Columbus, Georgia, and became the proprietress of three theaters, the Liberty in Columbus, and the Lyric and the Airdrome in Rome, Georgia, until her death. She died of a heart attack in 1939.

==Legacy and honors==
Ma Rainey created what is now known as &quot;classic blues&quot; while also portraying black life like never before. As a musical innovator she built on the minstrelsy and vaudeville performative traditions with comedic timing and a hybrid of American blues traditions she encountered in her vast tours across the country. She helped to pioneer a genre that appealed to North and South, rural and urban audiences.

Her signature low and gravelly voice sung with Rainey&#x27;s gusto and authoritative style inspired imitators from Louis Armstrong, Janis Joplin and Bonnie Raitt among others.

In her lyrics, Rainey portrayed the black female experience like few others of the time reflecting a wide range of emotions and experiences. In her 1999 book &quot;Blues Legacies and Black Feminism&quot;, Angela Davis wrote that Rainey&#x27;s songs are full of women who &quot;explicitly celebrate their right to conduct themselves as expansively and even as undesirably as men&quot;. In her songs, she and other black women sleep around for revenge, drink and party all night and generally live lives that &quot;transgressed these ideas of white middle class female respectability&quot;. The portrayals of black female sexuality, including those bucking heteronormative standards, fought ideas of what a woman should be and inspired Alice Walker in developing her characters for &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. Bragging about sexual escapades was popular in men&#x27;s songs at the time but her use of these themes in her works established her as both fiercely independent and fearless and many have drawn connections between her use of these themes and their modern use in Hip-Hop.

Rainey was also a fashion icon who pioneered flashy, expensive costuming in her performances, wearing ostrich plumes, satin gowns, sequins, gold necklaces, diamond tiaras, and gold teeth.

Rainey was inducted into the Blues Foundation&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. In 1994, the U.S. Post Office issued a 29-cent commemorative postage stamp honoring her. In 2004, &quot;See See Rider Blues&quot; (performed in 1924) was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and was added to the National Recording Registry by the National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress.

There was also a small museum opened in Columbus in 2007 to honor Ma Rainey&#x27;s legacy. It is in the very house that she had built for her mother and later lived in from 1935 until her death in 1939.

The first annual Ma Rainey International Blues Festival was held in April 2016 in Columbus, Georgia, near the home that Rainey owned and lived in at the time of her death. In 2017, the Rainey-McCullers School of the Arts opened in Columbus, Georgia, named in honor of Rainey and author Carson McCullers.

In 2023, she was awarded a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The announcement noted her &quot;deep voice and mesmerizing stage presence&quot; and that she, &quot;recorded almost 100 records, many of them national hits that are now part of the American musical canon&quot;.

== In popular culture==
Sterling A. Brown wrote the poem &quot;Ma Rainey&quot; in 1932, about how &quot;When Ma Rainey / comes to town&quot; people everywhere would hear her sing. In 1981, Sandra Lieb wrote the first full-length book about Rainey, &quot;Mother of the Blues: A Study of Ma Rainey&quot;.

&quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot;, a 1982 play by August Wilson, is a fictionalized account of a recording of her song of the same title set in 1927. Theresa Merritt and Whoopi Goldberg starred as Rainey in the Original and Revival Broadway productions, respectively. Viola Davis portrayed Rainey in the 2020 film adaptation of the play and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Mo&#x27;Nique played Rainey in the 2015 television film &quot;Bessie&quot; about the life of Bessie Smith, for which she earned a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

<doc id="164596" wikidata="Q4579588" url="?curid=164596" title="Storm track">
<text>Storm tracks are the relatively narrow zones in seas and oceans where storms travel driven by the prevailing winds. 

The Atlantic and Pacific have storm tracks along which most Atlantic or Pacific extratropical cyclones or tropical cyclones travel. The storm tracks usually begin in the westernmost parts of Atlantic and Pacific, where the large temperature contrasts between land and sea cause cyclones to form, particularly in winter. Surface friction cause these cyclones to quickly fill up and decay as soon as they reach land at the eastern end of the basins, accounting for the easternmost edges of the storm tracks.

Storm tracks can shift position, causing important climatic patterns. As an example, during La Niña the Atlantic storm track shifts north causing droughts in Palestine, while during El Niño it shifts south bringing heavy rains to the same region.

Another example of a storm track is the circumpolar storm track in the Antarctic, however land-sea contrasts play no role in its formation.

Given a grid point field of geopotential height, storm tracks can be visualized by contouring its average standard deviation, after the data has been band-pass filtered.

<text>In fluid dynamics, the fluid flow is often decomposed into a mean flow and deviations from the mean. The averaging can be done either in space or in time, or by ensemble averaging.

==Example==
Calculation of the mean flow may often be as simple as the mathematical mean: simply add up the given flow rates and then divide the final figure by the number of initial readings.

For example, given two discharges (&quot;Q&quot;) of 3 m³/s and 5 m³/s, we can use these flow rates &quot;Q&quot; to calculate the mean flow rate &quot;Q&quot;mean. Which in this case is &quot;Q&quot;mean = 4 m³/s.

<doc id="164598" wikidata="Q2997395" url="?curid=164598" title="Radiative cooling">
<text>In the study of heat transfer, radiative cooling is the process by which a body loses heat by thermal radiation. As Planck&#x27;s law describes, every physical body spontaneously and continuously emits electromagnetic radiation.

Radiative cooling has been applied in various contexts throughout human history, including ice making in India and Iran, heat shields for spacecraft, and in architecture. In 2014, a scientific breakthrough in the use of photonic metamaterials made daytime radiative cooling possible. It has since been proposed as a strategy to mitigate local and global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions known as passive daytime radiative cooling.

== Terrestrial radiative cooling ==

=== Mechanism ===
Infrared radiation can pass through dry, clear air in the wavelength range of 8–13 μm. Materials that can absorb energy and radiate it in those wavelengths exhibit a strong cooling effect. Materials that can also reflect 95% or more of sunlight in the 200 nanometres to 2.5 μm range can exhibit cooling even in direct sunlight.

=== Earth&#x27;s energy budget ===

The Earth-atmosphere system is radiatively cooled, emitting long-wave (infrared) radiation which balances the absorption of short-wave (visible light) energy from the sun.

Convective transport of heat, and evaporative transport of latent heat are both important in removing heat from the surface and distributing it in the atmosphere. Pure radiative transport is more important higher up in the atmosphere. Diurnal and geographical variation further complicate the picture.

The large-scale circulation of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is driven by the difference in absorbed solar radiation per square meter, as the sun heats the Earth more in the Tropics, mostly because of geometrical factors. The atmospheric and oceanic circulation redistributes some of this energy as sensible heat and latent heat partly via the mean flow and partly via eddies, known as cyclones in the atmosphere. Thus the tropics radiate less to space than they would if there were no circulation, and the poles radiate more; however in absolute terms the tropics radiate more energy to space.

=== Nocturnal surface cooling ===
Radiative cooling is commonly experienced on cloudless nights, when heat is radiated into outer space from Earth&#x27;s surface, or from the skin of a human observer. The effect is well-known among amateur astronomers.

The effect can be experienced by comparing skin temperature from looking straight up into a cloudless night sky for several seconds, to that after placing a sheet of paper between the face and the sky. Since outer space radiates at about a temperature of , and the sheet of paper radiates at about (around room temperature), the sheet of paper radiates more heat to the face than does the darkened cosmos. The effect is blunted by Earth&#x27;s surrounding atmosphere, and particularly the water vapor it contains, so the apparent temperature of the sky is far warmer than outer space. The sheet does not block the cold, but instead reflects heat to the face and radiates the heat of the face that it just absorbed.

The same radiative cooling mechanism can cause frost or black ice to form on surfaces exposed to the clear night sky, even when the ambient temperature does not fall below freezing.

=== Kelvin&#x27;s estimate of the Earth&#x27;s age ===

The term &quot;radiative cooling&quot; is generally used for local processes, though the same principles apply to cooling over geological time, which was first used by Kelvin to estimate the age of the Earth (although his estimate ignored the substantial heat released by radioisotope decay, not known at the time, and the effects of convection in the mantle).

=== Astronomy ===
Radiative cooling is one of the few ways an object in space can give off energy. In particular, white dwarf stars are no longer generating energy by fusion or gravitational contraction, and have no solar wind. So the only way their temperature changes is by radiative cooling. This makes their temperature as a function of age very predictable, so by observing the temperature, astronomers can deduce the age of the star.

== Applications ==

=== Climate change ===

=== Architecture ===

Cool roofs combine high solar reflectance with high infrared emittance, thereby simultaneously reducing heat gain from the sun and increasing heat removal through radiation. Radiative cooling thus offers potential for passive cooling for residential and commercial buildings. Traditional building surfaces, such as paint coatings, brick and concrete have high emittances of up to 0.96. They radiate heat into the sky to passively cool buildings at night. If made sufficiently reflective to sunlight, these materials can also achieve radiative cooling during the day.

The most common radiative coolers found on buildings are white cool-roof paint coatings, which have solar reflectances of up to 0.94, and thermal emittances of up to 0.96. The solar reflectance of the paints arises from optical scattering by the dielectric pigments embedded in the polymer paint resin, while the thermal emittance arises from the polymer resin. However, because typical white pigments like titanium dioxide and zinc oxide absorb ultraviolet radiation, the solar reflectances of paints based on such pigments do not exceed 0.95.

In 2014, researchers developed the first daytime radiative cooler using a multi-layer thermal photonic structure that selectively emits long wavelength infrared radiation into space, and can achieve 5 °C sub-ambient cooling under direct sunlight. Later researchers developed paintable porous polymer coatings, whose pores scatter sunlight to give solar reflectance of 0.96-0.99 and thermal emittance of 0.97. In experiments under direct sunlight, the coatings achieve 6 °C sub-ambient temperatures and cooling powers of 96 W/m2.

Other notable radiative cooling strategies include dielectric films on metal mirrors, and polymer or polymer composites on silver or aluminum films. Silvered polymer films with solar reflectances of 0.97 and thermal emittance of 0.96, which remain 11 °C cooler than commercial white paints under the mid-summer sun, were reported in 2015. Researchers explored designs with dielectric silicon dioxide or silicon carbide particles embedded in polymers that are translucent in the solar wavelengths and emissive in the infrared. In 2017, an example of this design with resonant polar silica microspheres randomly embedded in a polymeric matrix, was reported. The material is translucent to sunlight and has infrared emissivity of 0.93 in the infrared atmospheric transmission window. When backed with silver coating, the material achieved a midday radiative cooling power of 93 W/m2 under direct sunshine along with high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing.

===Heat shields===
High emissivity coatings that facilitate radiative cooling may be used in reusable thermal protection systems (RTPS) in spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft. In such heat shields a high emissivity material, such as molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) is applied on a thermally insulating ceramic substrate. In such heat shields high levels of total emissivity, typically in the range 0.8 - 0.9, need to be maintained across a range of high temperatures. Planck&#x27;s law dictates that at higher temperatures the radiative emission peak shifts to lower wavelengths (higher frequencies), influencing material selection as a function of operating temperature. In addition to effective radiative cooling, radiative thermal protection systems should provide damage tolerance and may incorporate self-healing functions through the formation of a viscous glass at high temperatures.

===James Webb Space Telescope===
The James Webb Space Telescope uses radiative cooling to reach its operation temperature of about 50 K. To do this, its large reflective sunshield blocks radiation from the Sun, Earth, and Moon. The telescope structure, kept permanently in shadow by the sunshield, then cools by radiation.

=== Nocturnal ice making in early India and Iran ===

Before the invention of artificial refrigeration technology, ice making by nocturnal cooling was common in both India and Iran.

In India, such apparatuses consisted of a shallow ceramic tray with a thin layer of water, placed outdoors with a clear exposure to the night sky. The bottom and sides were insulated with a thick layer of hay. On a clear night the water would lose heat by radiation upwards. Provided the air was calm and not too far above freezing, heat gain from the surrounding air by convection was low enough to allow the water to freeze.

In Iran, this involved making large flat ice pools, which consisted of a reflection pool of water built on a bed of highly insulative material surrounded by high walls. The high walls provided protection against convective warming, the insulative material of the pool walls would protect against conductive heating from the ground, the large flat plane of water would then permit evaporative and radiative cooling to take place.

== Types ==
The three basic types of radiant cooling are direct, indirect, and fluorescent:

* Direct radiant cooling - In a building designed to optimize direct radiation cooling, the building roof acts as a heat sink to absorb the daily internal loads. The roof acts as the best heat sink because it is the greatest surface exposed to the night sky. Radiate heat transfer with the night sky will remove heat from the building roof, thus cooling the building structure. Roof ponds are an example of this strategy. The roof pond design became popular with the development of the Sky thermal system designed by Harold Hay in 1977. There are various designs and configurations for the roof pond system but the concept is the same for all designs. The roof uses water, either plastic bags filled with water or an open pond, as the heat sink while a system of movable insulation panels regulate the mode of heating or cooling. During daytime in the summer, the water on the roof is protected from the solar radiation and ambient air temperature by movable insulation, which allows it to serve as a heat sink and absorb the heat generated inside through the ceiling. At night, the panels are retracted to allow nocturnal radiation between the roof pond and the night sky, thus removing the stored heat. In winter, the process is reversed so that the roof pond is allowed to absorb solar radiation during the day and release it during the night into the space below.
* Indirect radiant cooling - A heat transfer fluid removes heat from the building structure through radiate heat transfer with the night sky. A common design for this strategy involves a plenum between the building roof and the radiator surface. Air is drawn into the building through the plenum, cooled from the radiator, and cools the mass of the building structure. During the day, the building mass acts as a heat sink.
* Fluorescent radiant cooling - An object can be made fluorescent: it will then absorb light at some wavelengths, but radiate the energy away again at other, selected wavelengths. By selectively radiating heat in the infrared atmospheric window, a range of frequencies in which the atmosphere is unusually transparent, an object can effectively use outer space as a heat sink, and cool to well below ambient air temperature.

<doc id="164600" wikidata="Q650994" url="?curid=164600" title="General circulation model">
<text>A general circulation model (GCM) is a type of climate model. It employs a mathematical model of the general circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean. It uses the Navier–Stokes equations on a rotating sphere with thermodynamic terms for various energy sources (radiation, latent heat). These equations are the basis for computer programs used to simulate the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere or oceans. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs (AGCM and OGCM) are key components along with sea ice and land-surface components.

GCMs and global climate models are used for weather forecasting, understanding the climate, and forecasting climate change.

Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere and impose sea surface temperatures as boundary conditions. Coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs, e.g. HadCM3, EdGCM, GFDL CM2.X, ARPEGE-Climat) combine the two models. The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory AOGCMs represent the pinnacle of complexity in climate models and internalise as many processes as possible. However, they are still under development and uncertainties remain. They may be coupled to models of other processes, such as the carbon cycle, so as to better model feedback effects. Such integrated multi-system models are sometimes referred to as either &quot;earth system models&quot; or &quot;global climate models.&quot;

Versions designed for decade to century time scale climate applications were created by Syukuro Manabe and Kirk Bryan at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Princeton, New Jersey. These models are based on the integration of a variety of fluid dynamical, chemical and sometimes biological equations.

==Terminology==
The acronym &quot;GCM&quot; originally stood for &quot;General Circulation Model&quot;. Recently, a second meaning came into use, namely &quot;Global Climate Model&quot;. While these do not refer to the same thing, General Circulation Models are typically the tools used for modeling climate, and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, the term &quot;global climate model&quot; is ambiguous and may refer to an integrated framework that incorporates multiple components including a general circulation model, or may refer to the general class of climate models that use a variety of means to represent the climate mathematically.

==Atmospheric and oceanic models==

Atmospheric (AGCMs) and oceanic GCMs (OGCMs) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model (CGCM or AOGCM). With the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land, AOGCMs become the basis for a full climate model.

==Structure==
General Circulation Models (GCMs) discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time. Unlike simpler models, GCMs divide the atmosphere and/or oceans into grids of discrete &quot;cells&quot;, which represent computational units. Unlike simpler models which make mixing assumptions, processes internal to a cell—such as convection—that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly are parameterised at the cell level, while other functions govern the interface between cells.

Three-dimensional (more properly four-dimensional) GCMs apply discrete equations for fluid motion and integrate these forward in time. They contain parameterisations for processes such as convection that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly.

A simple general circulation model (SGCM) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity. Examples are programs that solve the primitive equations, given energy input and energy dissipation in the form of scale-dependent friction, so that atmospheric waves with the highest wavenumbers are most attenuated. Such models may be used to study atmospheric processes, but are not suitable for climate projections.

Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere (and typically contain a land-surface model as well) using imposed sea surface temperatures (SSTs). They may include atmospheric chemistry.

AGCMs consist of a dynamical core that integrates the equations of fluid motion, typically for:

* surface pressure
* horizontal components of velocity in layers
* temperature and water vapor in layers
* radiation, split into solar/short wave and terrestrial/infrared/long wave
* parameters for:
** convection
** land surface processes
** albedo 
** hydrology
** cloud cover

A GCM contains prognostic equations that are a function of time (typically winds, temperature, moisture, and surface pressure) together with diagnostic equations that are evaluated from them for a specific time period. As an example, pressure at any height can be diagnosed by applying the hydrostatic equation to the predicted surface pressure and the predicted values of temperature between the surface and the height of interest. Pressure is used to compute the pressure gradient force in the time-dependent equation for the winds.

OGCMs model the ocean (with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed) and may contain a sea ice model. For example, the standard resolution of HadOM3 is 1.25 degrees in latitude and longitude, with 20 vertical levels, leading to approximately 1,500,000 variables.

AOGCMs (e.g. HadCM3, GFDL CM2.X) combine the two submodels. They remove the need to specify fluxes across the interface of the ocean surface. These models are the basis for model predictions of future climate, such as are discussed by the IPCC. AOGCMs internalise as many processes as possible. They have been used to provide predictions at a regional scale. While the simpler models are generally susceptible to analysis and their results are easier to understand, AOGCMs may be nearly as hard to analyse as the climate itself.

===Grid===
The fluid equations for AGCMs are made discrete using either the finite difference method or the spectral method. For finite differences, a grid is imposed on the atmosphere. The simplest grid uses constant angular grid spacing (i.e., a latitude/longitude grid). However, non-rectangular grids (e.g., icosahedral) and grids of variable resolution are more often used. The LMDz model can be arranged to give high resolution over any given section of the planet. HadGEM1 (and other ocean models) use an ocean grid with higher resolution in the tropics to help resolve processes believed to be important for the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Spectral models generally use a Gaussian grid, because of the mathematics of transformation between spectral and grid-point space. Typical AGCM resolutions are between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude or longitude: HadCM3, for example, uses 3.75 in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude, giving a grid of 96 by 73 points (96 x 72 for some variables); and has 19 vertical levels. This results in approximately 500,000 &quot;basic&quot; variables, since each grid point has four variables (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;), though a full count would give more (clouds; soil levels). HadGEM1 uses a grid of 1.875 degrees in longitude and 1.25 in latitude in the atmosphere; HiGEM, a high-resolution variant, uses 1.25 x 0.83 degrees respectively. These resolutions are lower than is typically used for weather forecasting. Ocean resolutions tend to be higher, for example, HadCM3 has 6 ocean grid points per atmospheric grid point in the horizontal.

For a standard finite difference model, uniform gridlines converge towards the poles. This would lead to computational instabilities (see CFL condition) and so the model variables must be filtered along lines of latitude close to the poles. Ocean models suffer from this problem too, unless a rotated grid is used in which the North Pole is shifted onto a nearby landmass. Spectral models do not suffer from this problem. Some experiments use geodesic grids and icosahedral grids, which (being more uniform) do not have pole-problems. Another approach to solving the grid spacing problem is to deform a Cartesian cube such that it covers the surface of a sphere.

===Flux buffering===
Some early versions of AOGCMs required an &quot;ad hoc&quot; process of &quot;flux correction&quot; to achieve a stable climate. This resulted from separately prepared ocean and atmospheric models that each used an implicit flux from the other component different than that component could produce. Such a model failed to match observations. However, if the fluxes were &#x27;corrected&#x27;, the factors that led to these unrealistic fluxes might be unrecognised, which could affect model sensitivity. As a result, the vast majority of models used in the current round of IPCC reports do not use them. The model improvements that now make flux corrections unnecessary include improved ocean physics, improved resolution in both atmosphere and ocean, and more physically consistent coupling between the atmosphere and ocean submodels. Improved models now maintain stable, multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate projections.

===Convection===
Moist convection releases latent heat and is important to the Earth&#x27;s energy budget. Convection occurs on too small a scale to be resolved by climate models, and hence it must be handled via parameters. This has been done since the 1950s. Akio Arakawa did much of the early work, and variants of his scheme are still used, although a variety of different schemes are now in use. Clouds are also typically handled with a parameter, for a similar lack of scale. Limited understanding of clouds has limited the success of this strategy, but not due to some inherent shortcomings of the method.

===Software===
Most models include software to diagnose a wide range of variables for comparison with observations or study of atmospheric processes. An example is the 2-metre temperature, which is the standard height for near-surface observations of air temperature. This temperature is not directly predicted from the model but is deduced from surface and lowest-model-layer temperatures. Other software is used for creating plots and animations.

==Projections==

Coupled AOGCMs use transient climate simulations to project/predict climate changes under various scenarios. These can be idealised scenarios (most commonly, CO2 emissions increasing at 1%/yr) or based on recent history (usually the &quot;IS92a&quot; or more recently the SRES scenarios). Which scenarios are most realistic remains uncertain.

The 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report Figure 9.3 shows the global mean response of 19 different coupled models to an idealised experiment in which emissions increased at 1% per year. Figure 9.5 shows the response of a smaller number of models to more recent trends. For the 7 climate models shown there, the temperature change to 2100 varies from 2 to 4.5 °C with a median of about 3 °C.

Future scenarios do not include unknown events for example, volcanic eruptions or changes in solar forcing. These effects are believed to be small in comparison to greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing in the long term, but large volcanic eruptions, for example, can exert a substantial temporary cooling effect.

Human GHG emissions are a model input, although it is possible to include an economic/technological submodel to provide these as well. Atmospheric GHG levels are usually supplied as an input, though it is possible to include a carbon cycle model that reflects vegetation and oceanic processes to calculate such levels.

===Emissions scenarios===
For the six SRES marker scenarios, IPCC (2007:7–8) gave a &quot;best estimate&quot; of global mean temperature increase (2090–2099 relative to the period 1980–1999) of 1.8 °C to 4.0 °C. Over the same time period, the &quot;likely&quot; range (greater than 66% probability, based on expert judgement) for these scenarios was for a global mean temperature increase of 1.1 to 6.4 °C.

In 2008 a study made climate projections using several emission scenarios. In a scenario where global emissions start to decrease by 2010 and then decline at a sustained rate of 3% per year, the likely global average temperature increase was predicted to be 1.7 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, rising to around 2 °C by 2100. In a projection designed to simulate a future where no efforts are made to reduce global emissions, the likely rise in global average temperature was predicted to be 5.5 °C by 2100. A rise as high as 7 °C was thought possible, although less likely.

Another no-reduction scenario resulted in a median warming over land (2090–99 relative to the period 1980–99) of 5.1 °C. Under the same emissions scenario but with a different model, the predicted median warming was 4.1 °C.

===Model accuracy===
 

AOGCMs internalise as many processes as are sufficiently understood. However, they are still under development and significant uncertainties remain. They may be coupled to models of other processes in Earth system models, such as the carbon cycle, so as to better model feedback. Most recent simulations show &quot;plausible&quot; agreement with the measured temperature anomalies over the past 150 years, when driven by observed changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols. Agreement improves by including both natural and anthropogenic forcings.

Imperfect models may nevertheless produce useful results. GCMs are capable of reproducing the general features of the observed global temperature over the past century.

A debate over how to reconcile climate model predictions that upper air (tropospheric) warming should be greater than observed surface warming, some of which appeared to show otherwise, was resolved in favour of the models, following data revisions.

Cloud effects are a significant area of uncertainty in climate models. Clouds have competing effects on climate. They cool the surface by reflecting sunlight into space; they warm it by increasing the amount of infrared radiation transmitted from the atmosphere to the surface. In the 2001 IPCC report possible changes in cloud cover were highlighted as a major uncertainty in predicting climate.

Climate researchers around the world use climate models to understand the climate system. Thousands of papers have been published about model-based studies. Part of this research is to improve the models.

In 2000, a comparison between measurements and dozens of GCM simulations of ENSO-driven tropical precipitation, water vapor, temperature, and outgoing longwave radiation found similarity between measurements and simulation of most factors. However, the simulated change in precipitation was about one-fourth less than what was observed. Errors in simulated precipitation imply errors in other processes, such as errors in the evaporation rate that provides moisture to create precipitation. The other possibility is that the satellite-based measurements are in error. Either indicates progress is required in order to monitor and predict such changes.

The precise magnitude of future changes in climate is still uncertain; for the end of the 21st century (2071 to 2100), for SRES scenario A2, the change of global average SAT change from AOGCMs compared with 1961 to 1990 is +3.0 °C (5.4 °F) and the range is +1.3 to +4.5 °C (+2.3 to 8.1 °F).

The IPCC&#x27;s Fifth Assessment Report asserted &quot;very high confidence that models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the historical period&quot;. However, the report also observed that the rate of warming over the period 1998–2012 was lower than that predicted by 111 out of 114 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project climate models.

==Relation to weather forecasting==
The global climate models used for climate projections are similar in structure to (and often share computer code with) numerical models for weather prediction, but are nonetheless logically distinct.

Most weather forecasting is done on the basis of interpreting numerical model results. Since forecasts are typically a few days or a week and sea surface temperatures change relatively slowly, such models do not usually contain an ocean model but rely on imposed SSTs. They also require accurate initial conditions to begin the forecast typically these are taken from the output of a previous forecast, blended with observations. Weather predictions are required at higher temporal resolutions than climate projections, often sub-hourly compared to monthly or yearly averages for climate. However, because weather forecasts only cover around 10 days the models can also be run at higher vertical and horizontal resolutions than climate mode. Currently the ECMWF runs at resolution as opposed to the scale used by typical climate model runs. Often local models are run using global model results for boundary conditions, to achieve higher local resolution: for example, the Met Office runs a mesoscale model with an resolution covering the UK, and various agencies in the US employ models such as the NGM and NAM models. Like most global numerical weather prediction models such as the GFS, global climate models are often spectral models instead of grid models. Spectral models are often used for global models because some computations in modeling can be performed faster, thus reducing run times.

==Computations==
Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice.

All climate models take account of incoming energy as short wave electromagnetic radiation, chiefly visible and short-wave (near) infrared, as well as outgoing energy as long wave (far) infrared electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in temperature.

The most talked-about models of recent years relate temperature to emissions of greenhouse gases. These models project an upward trend in the surface temperature record, as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher altitudes.

Three (or more properly, four since time is also considered) dimensional GCM&#x27;s discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time. They also contain parametrisations for processes such as convection that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly.

Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere and impose sea surface temperatures as boundary conditions. Coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs, e.g. HadCM3, EdGCM, GFDL CM2.X, ARPEGE-Climat) combine the two models.

Models range in complexity:

* A simple radiant heat transfer model treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* This can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally
* Finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–sea ice global climate models discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.
* Box models treat flows across and within ocean basins.

Other submodels can be interlinked, such as land use, allowing researchers to predict the interaction between climate and ecosystems.

==Comparison with other climate models==
===Earth-system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs)===
The Climber-3 model uses a 2.5-dimensional statistical-dynamical model with 7.5° × 22.5° resolution and time step of 1/2 a day. An oceanic submodel is MOM-3 (Modular Ocean Model) with a 3.75° × 3.75° grid and 24 vertical levels.

===Radiative-convective models (RCM)===
One-dimensional, radiative-convective models were used to verify basic climate assumptions in the 1980s and 1990s.

===Earth system models===
GCMs can form part of Earth system models, e.g. by coupling ice sheet models for the dynamics of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and one or more chemical transport models (CTMs) for species important to climate. Thus a carbon chemistry transport model may allow a GCM to better predict anthropogenic changes in carbon dioxide concentrations. In addition, this approach allows accounting for inter-system feedback: e.g. chemistry-climate models allow the effects of climate change on the ozone hole to be studied.

==History==
In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model that could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere. It became the first successful climate model. Following Phillips&#x27;s work, several groups began working to create GCMs. The first to combine both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. By the early 1980s, the United States&#x27; National Center for Atmospheric Research had developed the Community Atmosphere Model; this model has been continuously refined. In 1996, efforts began to model soil and vegetation types. Later the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research&#x27;s HadCM3 model coupled ocean-atmosphere elements. The role of gravity waves was added in the mid-1980s. Gravity waves are required to simulate regional and global scale circulations accurately.

<text>Post-Impressionism (also spelled Postimpressionism) was a predominantly French art movement that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of Fauvism. Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction against Impressionists&#x27; concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour. Its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content means Post-Impressionism encompasses Les Nabis, Neo-Impressionism, Symbolism, Cloisonnism, the Pont-Aven School, and Synthetism, along with some later Impressionists&#x27; work. The movement&#x27;s principal artists were Paul Cézanne (known as the father of Post-Impressionism), Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat.

The term Post-Impressionism was first used by art critic Roger Fry in 1906. Critic Frank Rutter in a review of the Salon d&#x27;Automne published in &quot;Art News&quot;, 15 October 1910, described Othon Friesz as a &quot;post-impressionist leader&quot;; there was also an advert for the show &quot;The Post-Impressionists of France&quot;. Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organised the 1910 exhibition &quot;Manet and the Post-Impressionists&quot;, defining it as the development of French art since Édouard Manet.

Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, sometimes using impasto (thick application of paint) and painting from life, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or modified colour.

==Overview==
The Post-Impressionists were dissatisfied with what they felt was the triviality of subject matter and the loss of structure in Impressionist paintings, though they did not agree on the way forward. Georges Seurat and his followers concerned themselves with pointillism, the systematic use of tiny dots of colour. Paul Cézanne set out to restore a sense of order and structure to painting, to &quot;make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of the museums&quot;. He achieved this by reducing objects to their basic shapes while retaining the saturated colours of Impressionism. The Impressionist Camille Pissarro experimented with Neo-Impressionist ideas between the mid-1880s and the early 1890s. Discontented with what he referred to as romantic Impressionism, he investigated pointillism, which he called scientific Impressionism, before returning to a purer Impressionism in the last decade of his life. Vincent van Gogh often used vibrant colour and conspicuous brushstrokes to convey his feelings and his state of mind.

Although they often exhibited together, Post-Impressionist artists were not in agreement concerning a cohesive movement. Yet, the abstract concerns of harmony and structural arrangement, in the work of all these artists, took precedence over naturalism. Artists such as Seurat adopted a meticulously scientific approach to colour and composition.

==Defining Post-Impressionism==
The term was used in 1906, and again in 1910 by Roger Fry in the title of an exhibition of modern French painters: &quot;Manet and the Post-Impressionists&quot;, organized by Fry for the Grafton Galleries in London. Three weeks before Fry&#x27;s show, art critic Frank Rutter had put the term &quot;Post-Impressionist&quot; in print in &quot;Art News&quot; of 15 October 1910, during a review of the Salon d&#x27;Automne, where he described Othon Friesz as a &quot;post-impressionist leader&quot;; there was also an advert in the journal for the show &quot;The Post-Impressionists of France&quot;.

Most of the artists in Fry&#x27;s exhibition were younger than the Impressionists. Fry later explained: &quot;For purposes of convenience, it was necessary to give these artists a name, and I chose, as being the vaguest and most non-committal, the name of Post-Impressionism. This merely stated their position in time relatively to the Impressionist movement.&quot; John Rewald limited the scope to the years between 1886 and 1892 in his pioneering publication on &quot;Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin&quot; (1956). Rewald considered this a continuation of his 1946 study, &quot;History of Impressionism&quot;, and pointed out that a &quot;subsequent volume dedicated to the second half of the post-impressionist period&quot;: &quot;Post-Impressionism: From Gauguin to Matisse&quot;, was to follow. This volume would extend the period covered to other artistic movements derived from Impressionism, though confined to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rewald focused on such outstanding early Post-Impressionists active in France as van Gogh, Gauguin, Seurat, and Redon. He explored their relationships as well as the artistic circles they frequented (or were in opposition to), including:
* Neo-Impressionism: ridiculed by contemporary art critics as well as artists as Pointillism; Seurat and Signac would have preferred other terms: Divisionism for example
* Cloisonnism: a short-lived term introduced in 1888 by the art critic Édouard Dujardin, was to promote the work of Louis Anquetin, and was later also applied to contemporary works of his friend Émile Bernard
* Synthetism: another short-lived term coined in 1889 to distinguish recent works of Gauguin and Bernard from that of more traditional Impressionists exhibiting with them at the Café Volpini.
* Pont-Aven School: implying little more than that the artists involved had been working for a while in Pont-Aven or elsewhere in Brittany.
* Symbolism: a term highly welcomed by vanguard critics in 1891, when Gauguin dropped Synthetism as soon as he was acclaimed to be the leader of Symbolism in painting.
Furthermore, in his introduction to Post-Impressionism, Rewald opted for a second volume featuring Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri Rousseau &quot;le Douanier&quot;, Les Nabis and Cézanne as well as the Fauves, the young Picasso and Gauguin&#x27;s last trip to the South Seas; it was to expand the period covered at least into the first decade of the 20th century—yet this second volume remained unfinished.
===Reviews and adjustments===
Rewald wrote that &quot;the term &#x27;Post-Impressionism&#x27; is not a very precise one, though a very convenient one&quot;; convenient, when the term is by definition limited to French visual arts derived from Impressionism since 1886. Rewald&#x27;s approach to historical data was narrative rather than analytic, and beyond this point he believed it would be sufficient to &quot;let the sources speak for themselves.&quot;

Rival terms like Modernism or Symbolism were never as easy to handle, for they covered literature, architecture and other arts as well, and they expanded to other countries.

* Modernism, thus, is now considered to be the central movement within &quot;international&quot; western civilization with its original roots in France, going back beyond the French Revolution to the Age of Enlightenment.
* Symbolism, however, is considered to be a concept which emerged a century later in France, and implied an individual approach. Local national traditions as well as individual settings therefore could stand side by side, and from the very beginning a broad variety of artists practicing some kind of symbolic imagery, ranged between extreme positions: The Nabis for example united to find synthesis of tradition and brand new form, while others kept to traditional, more or less academic forms, when they were looking for fresh contents: Symbolism is therefore often linked to fantastic, esoteric, erotic and other non-realist subject matter.

To meet the recent discussion, the connotations of the term &#x27;Post-Impressionism&#x27; were challenged again: Alan Bowness and his collaborators expanded the period covered forward to 1914 and the beginning of World War I, but limited their approach widely on the 1890s to France. Other European countries are pushed back to standard connotations, and Eastern Europe is completely excluded.

In Germany, it was Paul Baum and Carl Schmitz-Pleis who, in retrospect, provided the decisive impetus.

So, while a split may be seen between classical &#x27;Impressionism&#x27; and &#x27;Post-Impressionism&#x27; in 1886, the end and the extent of &#x27;Post-Impressionism&#x27; remains under discussion. For Bowness and his contributors as well as for Rewald, &#x27;Cubism&#x27; was an absolutely fresh start, and so Cubism has been seen in France since the beginning, and later in England. Meanwhile, Eastern European artists, however, did not care so much for western traditions, and proceeded to manners of painting called abstract and suprematic—terms expanding far into the 20th century.

According to the present state of discussion, &quot;Post-Impressionism&quot; is a term best used within Rewald&#x27;s definition in a strictly historical manner, concentrating on French art between 1886 and 1914, and re-considering the altered positions of &quot;impressionist&quot; painters like Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Auguste Renoir, and others—as well as all new schools and movements at the turn of the century: from Cloisonnism to Cubism. The declarations of war, in July/August 1914, indicate probably far more than the beginning of a World War—they signal a major break in European cultural history, too.

Along with general art history information given about &quot;Post-Impressionism&quot; works, there are many museums that offer additional history, information and gallery works, both online and in house, that can help viewers understand a deeper meaning of &quot;Post-Impressionism&quot; in terms of fine art and traditional art applications.

==Post-Impression in specific countries==
&quot;The Advent of Modernism: Post-impressionism and North American Art, 1900-1918&quot; by Peter Morrin, Judith Zilczer, and William C. Agee, the catalogue for an exhibition at the High Museum of Art, Atlanta in 1986, gave a major overview of Post-Impressionism in North America.

===Canada===
Canadian Post-Impressionism is an offshoot of Post-Impressionism. In 1913, the Art Association of Montreal&#x27;s Spring show included the work of Randolph Hewton, A. Y. Jackson and John Lyman: it was reviewed with sharp criticism by the &quot;Montreal Daily Witness&quot; and the &quot;Montreal Daily Star&quot;. Post-Impressionism was extended to include a painting by Lyman, who had studied with Matisse. Lyman wrote in defence of the term and defined it. He referred to the British show which he described as a great exhibition of modern art.

====Canadian artists and exhibitions====
A wide and diverse variety of artists are called by this name in Canada. Among them are James Wilson Morrice, John Lyman, David Milne, and Tom Thomson, members of the Group of Seven, and Emily Carr. In 2001, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa organized the travelling exhibition &quot;The Birth of the Modern: Post-Impressionism in Canada, 1900-1920&quot;.

<text>The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to &quot;beat the market&quot; consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.

Because the EMH is formulated in terms of risk adjustment, it only makes testable predictions when coupled with a particular model of risk. As a result, research in financial economics since at least the 1990s has focused on market anomalies, that is, deviations from specific models of risk.

The idea that financial market returns are difficult to predict goes back to Bachelier, Mandelbrot, and Samuelson, but is closely associated with Eugene Fama, in part due to his influential 1970 review of the theoretical and empirical research. The EMH provides the basic logic for modern risk-based theories of asset prices, and frameworks such as consumption-based asset pricing and intermediary asset pricing can be thought of as the combination of a model of risk with the EMH.

Many decades of empirical research on return predictability has found mixed evidence. Research in the 1950s and 1960s often found a lack of predictability, yet the 1980s-2000s saw an explosion of discovered return predictors. Since the 2010s, studies have often found that return predictability has become more elusive, as predictability fails to work out-of-sample, or has been weakened by advances in trading technology and investor learning.

== Theoretical background ==
Suppose that a piece of information about the value of a stock (say, about a future merger) is widely available to investors. If the price of the stock does not already reflect that information, then investors can trade on it, thereby moving the price until the information is no longer useful for trading.

Note that this thought experiment does not necessarily imply that stock prices are unpredictable. For example, suppose that the piece of information in question says that a financial crisis is likely to come soon. Investors typically do not like to hold stocks during a financial crisis, and thus investors may sell stocks until the price drops enough so that the expected return compensates for this risk.

How efficient markets are (and are not) linked to the random walk theory can be described through the fundamental theorem of asset pricing. This theorem provides mathematical predictions regarding the price of a stock, assuming that there is no arbitrage, that is, assuming that there is no risk-free way to trade profitably. Formally, if arbitrage is impossible, then the theorem predicts that the price of a stock is the discounted value of its future price and dividend:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the expected value given information at time formula_3, formula_4 is the stochastic discount factor, and formula_5 is the dividend the stock pays next period.

Note that this equation does not generally imply a random walk. However, if we assume the stochastic discount factor is constant and the time interval is short enough so that no dividend is being paid, we have

:formula_6.

Taking logs and assuming that the Jensen&#x27;s inequality term is negligible, we have

:formula_7

which implies that the log of stock prices follows a random walk (with a drift).

Although the concept of an efficient market is similar to the assumption that stock prices follow:

formula_8

which follows a martingale, the EMH does not always assume that stocks follow a martingale.

== Empirical studies ==
Research by Alfred Cowles in the 1930s and 1940s suggested that professional investors were in general unable to outperform the market. During the 1930s-1950s empirical studies focused on time-series properties, and found that US stock prices and related financial series followed a random walk model in the short-term. While there is some predictability over the long-term, the extent to which this is due to rational time-varying risk premia as opposed to behavioral reasons is a subject of debate. In their seminal paper, propose the event study methodology and show that stock prices on average react before a stock split, but have no movement afterwards.

===Weak, semi-strong, and strong-form tests===
In Fama&#x27;s influential 1970 review paper, he categorized empirical tests of efficiency into &quot;weak-form&quot;, &quot;semi-strong-form&quot;, and &quot;strong-form&quot; tests.

These categories of tests refer to the information set used in the statement &quot;prices reflect all available information.&quot; Weak-form tests study the information contained in historical prices. Semi-strong form tests study information (beyond historical prices) which is publicly available. Strong-form tests regard private information.

==Historical background==
Benoit Mandelbrot claimed the efficient markets theory was first proposed by the French mathematician Louis Bachelier in 1900 in his PhD thesis &quot;The Theory of Speculation&quot; describing how prices of commodities and stocks varied in markets. It has been speculated that Bachelier drew ideas from the random walk model of Jules Regnault, but Bachelier did not cite him, and Bachelier&#x27;s thesis is now considered pioneering in the field of financial mathematics. It is commonly thought that Bachelier&#x27;s work gained little attention and was forgotten for decades until it was rediscovered in the 1950s by Leonard Savage, and then become more popular after Bachelier&#x27;s thesis was translated into English in 1964. But the work was never forgotten in the mathematical community, as Bachelier published a book in 1912 detailing his ideas, which was cited by mathematicians including Joseph L. Doob, William Feller and Andrey Kolmogorov. The book continued to be cited, but then starting in the 1960s the original thesis by Bachelier began to be cited more than his book when economists started citing Bachelier&#x27;s work.

The concept of market efficiency had been anticipated at the beginning of the century in the dissertation submitted by Bachelier (1900) to the Sorbonne for his PhD in mathematics. In his opening paragraph, Bachelier recognizes that &quot;past, present and even discounted future events are reflected in market price, but often show no apparent relation to price changes&quot;.

The efficient markets theory was not popular until the 1960s when the advent of computers made it possible to compare calculations and prices of hundreds of stocks more quickly and effortlessly. In 1945, F.A. Hayek argued in his article The Use of Knowledge in Society that markets were the most effective way of aggregating the pieces of information dispersed among individuals within a society. Given the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more efficient market prices. In the competitive limit, market prices reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news. Thus there is a very close link between EMH and the random walk hypothesis.

Early theories posited that predicting stock prices is unfeasible, as they depend on fresh information or news rather than existing or historical prices. Therefore, stock prices are thought to fluctuate randomly, and their predictability is believed to be no better than a 50% accuracy rate.

The efficient-market hypothesis emerged as a prominent theory in the mid-1960s. Paul Samuelson had begun to circulate Bachelier&#x27;s work among economists. In 1964 Bachelier&#x27;s dissertation along with the empirical studies mentioned above were published in an anthology edited by Paul Cootner. In 1965, Eugene Fama published his dissertation arguing for the random walk hypothesis. Also, Samuelson published a proof showing that if the market is efficient, prices will exhibit random-walk behavior. This is often cited in support of the efficient-market theory, by the method of affirming the consequent, however in that same paper, Samuelson warns against such backward reasoning, saying &quot;From a nonempirical base of axioms you never get empirical results.&quot; In 1970, Fama published a review of both the theory and the evidence for the hypothesis. The paper extended and refined the theory, included the definitions for three forms of financial market efficiency: weak, semi-strong and strong (see above).

==Criticism==
Investors, including the likes of Warren Buffett, George Soros, and researchers have disputed the efficient-market hypothesis both empirically and theoretically. Behavioral economists attribute the imperfections in financial markets to a combination of cognitive biases such as overconfidence, overreaction, representative bias, information bias, and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing. These have been researched by psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky and Paul Slovic and economist Richard Thaler.

Empirical evidence has been mixed, but has generally not supported strong forms of the efficient-market hypothesis. According to Dreman and Berry, in a 1995 paper, low P/E (price-to-earnings) stocks have greater returns. In an earlier paper, Dreman also refuted the assertion by Ray Ball that these higher returns could be attributed to higher beta leading to a failure to correctly risk-adjust returns; Dreman&#x27;s research had been accepted by efficient market theorists as explaining the anomaly in neat accordance with modern portfolio theory.

===Behavioral psychology===
Behavioral psychology approaches to stock market trading are among some of the alternatives to EMH (investment strategies such as momentum trading seek to exploit exactly such inefficiencies). However, Nobel Laureate co-founder of the programme Daniel Kahneman —announced his skepticism of investors beating the market: &quot;They&#x27;re just not going to do it. It&#x27;s just not going to happen.&quot; Indeed, defenders of EMH maintain that behavioral finance strengthens the case for EMH in that it highlights biases in individuals and committees and not competitive markets. For example, one prominent finding in behavioral finance is that individuals employ hyperbolic discounting. It is demonstrably true that bonds, mortgages, annuities and other similar obligations subject to competitive market forces do not. Any manifestation of hyperbolic discounting in the pricing of these obligations would invite arbitrage thereby quickly eliminating any vestige of individual biases. Similarly, diversification, derivative securities and other hedging strategies assuage if not eliminate potential mispricings from the severe risk-intolerance (loss aversion) of individuals underscored by behavioral finance. On the other hand, economists, behavioral psychologists and mutual fund managers are drawn from the human population and are therefore subject to the biases that behavioralists showcase. By contrast, the price signals in markets are far less subject to individual biases highlighted by the Behavioral Finance programme. Richard Thaler has started a fund based on his research on cognitive biases. In a 2008 report he identified complexity and herd behavior as central to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

Further empirical work has highlighted the impact transaction costs have on the concept of market efficiency, with much evidence suggesting that any anomalies pertaining to market inefficiencies are the result of a cost benefit analysis made by those willing to incur the cost of acquiring the valuable information in order to trade on it. Additionally, the concept of liquidity is a critical component to capturing &quot;inefficiencies&quot; in tests for abnormal returns. Any test of this proposition faces the joint hypothesis problem, where it is impossible to ever test for market efficiency, since to do so requires the use of a measuring stick against which abnormal returns are compared —one cannot know if the market is efficient if one does not know if a model correctly stipulates the required rate of return. Consequently, a situation arises where either the asset pricing model is incorrect or the market is inefficient, but one has no way of knowing which is the case.

The performance of stock markets is correlated with the amount of sunshine in the city where the main exchange is located.

=== EMH anomalies and rejection of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) ===
While event studies of stock splits are consistent with the EMH, other empirical analyses have found problems with the efficient-market hypothesis. Early examples include the observation that small neglected stocks and stocks with high book-to-market (low price-to-book) ratios (value stocks) tended to achieve abnormally high returns relative to what could be explained by the CAPM. Further tests of portfolio efficiency by Gibbons, Ross and Shanken (1989) (GJR) led to rejections of the CAPM, although tests of efficiency inevitably run into the joint hypothesis problem (see Roll&#x27;s critique).

Following GJR&#x27;s results and mounting empirical evidence of EMH anomalies, academics began to move away from the CAPM towards risk factor models such as the Fama-French 3 factor model. These risk factor models are not properly founded on economic theory (whereas CAPM is founded on Modern Portfolio Theory), but rather, constructed with long-short portfolios in response to the observed empirical EMH anomalies. For instance, the &quot;small-minus-big&quot; (SMB) factor in the FF3 factor model is simply a portfolio that holds long positions on small stocks and short positions on large stocks to mimic the risks small stocks face. These risk factors are said to represent some aspect or dimension of undiversifiable systematic risk which should be compensated with higher expected returns. Additional popular risk factors include the &quot;HML&quot; value factor, &quot;MOM&quot; momentum factor, &quot;ILLIQ&quot; liquidity factors. See also Robert Haugen.

===View of some journalists, economists, and investors===
Several observers have argued closed end funds (CEFs) show evidence of market inefficiency. Unlike mutual funds or exchange traded funds which can regularly redeem or create new shares and tend to trade very close to net asset value (NAV) of the assets held within the fund, CEFs raise capital by issuing a fixed number of shares at inception and after inception are closed to new capital. CEFs often trade at a price that is at a substantial discount (below) to their NAV but can also trade a premium (above NAV), implying that investors are paying substantially above or below the price for the same securities sold as CEFs than when sold in other contexts.

Economists Matthew Bishop and Michael Green claim that full acceptance of the hypothesis goes against the thinking of Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes, who both believed irrational behavior had a real impact on the markets.

Economist John Quiggin has claimed that &quot;Bitcoin is perhaps the finest example of a pure bubble&quot;, and that it provides a conclusive refutation of EMH. While other assets that have been used as currency (such as gold, tobacco) have value or utility independent of people&#x27;s willingness to accept them as payment, Quiggin argues that &quot;in the case of Bitcoin there is no source of value whatsoever&quot; and thus Bitcoin should be priced at zero or worthless.

Tshilidzi Marwala surmised that artificial intelligence (AI) influences the applicability of the efficient market hypothesis in that the greater amount of AI-based market participants, the more efficient the markets become.

Warren Buffett has also argued against EMH, most notably in his 1984 presentation &quot;The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville&quot;. He says preponderance of value investors among the world&#x27;s money managers with the highest rates of performance rebuts the claim of EMH proponents that luck is the reason some investors appear more successful than others. Nonetheless, Buffett has recommended index funds that aim to track average market returns for most investors. Buffett&#x27;s business partner Charlie Munger has stated the EMH is &quot;obviously roughly correct&quot;, in that a hypothetical average investor will tend towards average results &quot;and it&#x27;s quite hard for anybody to [consistently] beat the market by significant margins&quot;. However, Munger also believes &quot;extreme&quot; commitment to the EMH is &quot;bonkers&quot;, as the theory&#x27;s originators were seduced by an &quot;intellectually consistent theory that allowed them to do pretty mathematics [yet] the fundamentals did not properly tie to reality.&quot;

Burton Malkiel in his &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; (1973) argues that &quot;the preponderance of statistical evidence&quot; supports EMH, but admits there are enough &quot;gremlins lurking about&quot; in the data to prevent EMH from being conclusively proved.

In his book &quot;The Reformation in Economics&quot;, economist and financial analyst Philip Pilkington has argued that the EMH is actually a tautology masquerading as a theory. He argues that, taken at face value, the theory makes the banal claim that the average investor will not beat the market average—which is a tautology. When pressed on this point, Pinkington argues that EMH proponents will usually say that any &quot;actual investor&quot; will converge with the &quot;average investor&quot; given enough time and so no investor will beat the market average. But Pilkington points out that when proponents of the theory are presented with evidence that a small minority of investors do, in fact, beat the market over the long-run, these proponents then say that these investors were simply &#x27;lucky&#x27;. Pilkington argues that introducing the idea that anyone who diverges from the theory is simply &#x27;lucky&#x27; insulates the theory from falsification and so, drawing on the philosopher of science and critic of neoclassical economics Hans Albert, Pilkington argues that the theory falls back into being a tautology or a pseudoscientific construct.

Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson argued that the stock market is &quot;micro efficient&quot; but not &quot;macro efficient&quot;: the EMH is much better suited for individual stocks than it is for the aggregate stock market as a whole. Research based on regression and scatter diagrams, published in 2005, has strongly supported Samuelson&#x27;s dictum.

Mathematician Andrew Odlyzko argued in a 2010 paper that the UK Railway Mania of the 1830s and &#x27;40s &quot;provides a convincing demonstration of market inefficiency.&quot; When railroads were a new and innovative technology, there was widespread public interest in trading rail-related stocks and large amounts of capital were devoted to building more rail projects than could realistically be used for shipping or passengers. After the mania collapsed in the 1840s, many railroad stocks were worthless and many planned projects abandoned. 

Peter Lynch, a mutual fund manager at Fidelity Investments who consistently more than doubled market averages while managing the Magellan Fund, has argued that the EMH is contradictory to the random walk hypothesis—though both concepts are widely taught in business schools without seeming awareness of a contradiction. If asset prices are rational and based on all available data as the efficient market hypothesis proposes, then fluctuations in asset price are &quot;not&quot; random. But if the random walk hypothesis is valid, then asset prices are not rational.

Joel Tillinghast, also a fund manager at Fidelity with a long history of outperforming a benchmark, has written that the core arguments of the EMH are &quot;more true than not&quot; and he accepts a &quot;sloppy&quot; version of the theory allowing for a margin of error. But he also contends the EMH is not completely accurate or accurate in all cases, given the recurrent existence of economic bubbles (when some assets are dramatically overpriced) and the fact that value investors (who focus on underpriced assets) have tended to outperform the broader market over long periods. Tillinghast also asserts that even staunch EMH proponents will admit weaknesses to the theory when assets are significantly over- or under-priced, such as double or half their value according to fundamental analysis.

In a 2012 book, investor Jack Schwager argues the EMH is &quot;right for the wrong reasons&quot;. He agrees it is &quot;very difficult&quot; to consistently beat average market returns, but contends it&#x27;s not due to how information is distributed more or less instantly to all market participants. Information may be distributed more or less instantly, but Schwager proposes information may not be interpreted or applied in the same way by different people and skill may play a factor in how information is used. Schwager argues markets are difficult to beat because of the unpredictable and sometimes irrational behavior of humans who buy and sell assets in the stock market. Schwager also cites several instances of mispricing that he contends are impossible according to a strict or strong interpretation of the EMH.

===2007–2008 financial crisis===
The 2007–2008 financial crisis led to renewed scrutiny and criticism of the hypothesis. Market strategist Jeremy Grantham said the EMH was responsible for the current financial crisis, claiming that belief in the hypothesis caused financial leaders to have a &quot;chronic underestimation of the dangers of asset bubbles breaking&quot;. Financial journalist Roger Lowenstein said &quot;The upside of the current Great Recession is that it could drive a stake through the heart of the academic nostrum known as the efficient-market hypothesis.&quot; Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said &quot;It should be clear that among the causes of the recent financial crisis was an unjustified faith in rational expectations, market efficiencies, and the techniques of modern finance.&quot; One financial analyst said &quot;By 2007–2009, you had to be a fanatic to believe in the literal truth of the EMH.&quot;

At the International Organization of Securities Commissions annual conference, held in June 2009, the hypothesis took center stage. Martin Wolf, the chief economics commentator for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, dismissed the hypothesis as being a useless way to examine how markets function in reality. Economist Paul McCulley said the hypothesis had not failed, but was &quot;seriously flawed&quot; in its neglect of human nature.

The financial crisis led economics scholar Richard Posner to back away from the hypothesis. Posner accused some of his Chicago School colleagues of being &quot;asleep at the switch&quot;, saying that &quot;the movement to deregulate the financial industry went too far by exaggerating the resilience—the self healing powers—of laissez-faire capitalism.&quot; Others, such as economist and Nobel laurete Eugene Fama, said that the hypothesis held up well during the crisis: &quot;Stock prices typically decline prior to a recession and in a state of recession. This was a particularly severe recession. Prices started to decline in advance of when people recognized that it was a recession and then continued to decline. That was exactly what you would expect if markets are efficient.&quot; Despite this, Fama said that &quot;poorly informed investors could theoretically lead the market astray&quot; and that stock prices could become &quot;somewhat irrational&quot; as a result.

== Efficient markets applied in securities class action litigation ==

The theory of efficient markets has been practically applied in the field of Securities Class Action Litigation. Efficient market theory, in conjunction with &quot;fraud-on-the-market theory&quot;, has been used in Securities Class Action Litigation to both justify and as mechanism for the calculation of damages. In the Supreme Court Case, Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-317, the use of efficient market theory in supporting securities class action litigation was affirmed. Supreme Court Justice Roberts wrote that &quot;the court&#x27;s ruling was consistent with the ruling in &#x27;Basic&#x27; because it allows &#x27;direct evidence when such evidence is available&#x27; instead of relying exclusively on the efficient markets theory.&quot;

<doc id="164603" wikidata="Q29230" url="?curid=164603" title="Martti Ahtisaari">
<text>Martti Oiva Kalevi Ahtisaari (, 23 June 1937 – 16 October 2023) was a Finnish politician, the tenth president of Finland, from 1994 to 2000, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and a United Nations diplomat and mediator noted for his international peace work.

Ahtisaari was a United Nations special envoy for Kosovo, charged with organizing the Kosovo status process negotiations. These negotiations aimed to resolve a long-running dispute in Kosovo, which later declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. In October 2008, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts&quot;. The Nobel statement said that Ahtisaari had played a prominent role in resolving serious and long-lasting conflicts, including ones in Namibia, Aceh (Indonesia), Kosovo and Serbia, and Iraq.

== Youth and early career ==

Martti Ahtisaari was born in Viipuri, Finland (now Vyborg, Russia) on 23 June 1937. His father, Oiva Ahtisaari, whose grandfather Julius Marenius Adolfsen had emigrated with his parents to Kotka, Finland in 1872 from Tistedalen in Southern Norway, took Finnish citizenship in 1929 and Finnicized his surname from Adolfsen in 1935. Oiva was working as a NCO in the supply troops in Viipuri when Martti was born.

The Continuation War (World War II) took Oiva Ahtisaari to the front as a non-commissioned officer army mechanic, while Martti&#x27;s mother, Tyyne, moved to Kuopio with her son to escape immediate danger from the war in 1940. Kuopio was where Ahtisaari spent most of his childhood, eventually attending Kuopion Lyseo high school.

In 1952, Martti Ahtisaari moved to Oulu with his family. There he continued his education in high school, graduating in 1956. He also joined the local YMCA. After completing his military service (Ahtisaari held the rank of captain in the Finnish Army Reserve), he began to study at Oulu teachers&#x27; college, attending the two-year course which enabled him to qualify as a primary-school teacher in 1959. 

In the summer of 1960, Ahtisaari signed the contract for the position of director of the Swedish Agency for International Development physical education boarding school in Karachi, Pakistan, after interviewing in Sweden and hearing about the offer announced by the YMCA in April of that year. There, he also trained as a teacher.

He returned to Finland in 1963 and began his studies in the Helsinki School of Economics and soon became the Executive Director of the Helsinki International Student Club and Student International Aid, where he made friends with Namibian Nickey Iyambo. He also joined the international students&#x27; organisation AIESEC. In 1965, he joined the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in its Bureau for International Development Aid, to set up the International Development Assistance Office together with Jaakko Iloniemi, which was a pioneering office, as the Finnish presence in international cooperation in the Third World was non-existent. Ahtisaari remained in that office until 1972, where he served from 1971 as assistant to the director, a position he combined with his presence on the Government&#x27;s Advisory Committee for Trade and Industry Affairs of Developing Countries.

== Diplomatic career==

===In the Namibian independence transition===
Ahtisaari began his diplomatic career in 1973 when he became Finland&#x27;s Ambassador to Tanzania, Zambia, Somalia and Mozambique, an office he held until 1977. This new mission allowed him to get closer to East African affairs, monitoring from Dar es Salaam the independence process of Namibia and maintaining close contacts with South West Africa People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO). In 1977 he was recalled by the United Nations to succeed Seán MacBride as United Nations Commissioner for Namibia, a post he held until 1981, and as representative of Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim from 1978. 

Following the death of a later UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, on Pan Am Flight 103 on 21 December 1988 – on the eve of the signing of the Tripartite Accord at UN Headquarters – Ahtisaari was sent to Namibia in April 1989 as the UN Special Representative to head the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). Because of the illegal incursion of SWAPO troops from Angola, the South African appointed Administrator-General (AG), Louis Pienaar, sought Ahtisaari&#x27;s agreement to the deployment of SADF troops to stabilize the situation. Ahtisaari took advice from British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who was visiting the region at the time, and approved the SADF deployment. A period of intense fighting ensued when at least 375 SWAPO insurgents were killed. In July 1989, Glenys Kinnock and Tessa Blackstone of the British Council of Churches visited Namibia and reported: &quot;There is a widespread feeling that too many concessions were made to South African personnel and preferences and that Martti Ahtisaari was not forceful enough in his dealings with the South Africans.&quot;

Perhaps because of his reluctance to authorise this SADF deployment, Ahtisaari was alleged to have been targeted by the South African Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB). According to a hearing in September 2000 of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, two CCB operatives (Kobus le Roux and Ferdinand Barnard) were tasked not to kill Ahtisaari, but to give him &quot;a good hiding&quot;. To carry out the assault, Barnard had planned to use the grip handle of a metal saw as a knuckleduster. In the event, Ahtisaari did not attend the meeting at the Keetmanshoop Hotel, where Le Roux and Barnard lay in wait for him, and thus Ahtisaari escaped injury.

After the independence elections of 1989, Ahtisaari and his wife were made honorary Namibian citizens in 1992. South Africa gave him the O R Tambo award for &quot;his outstanding achievement as a diplomat and commitment to the cause of freedom in Africa and peace in the world&quot;.

Ahtisaari served as UN undersecretary-general for administration and management from 1987 to 1991 causing mixed feelings inside the organisation during an internal investigation of massive fraud. When Ahtisaari revealed in 1990 that he had secretly lengthened the grace period allowing UN officials to return misappropriated taxpayer money from the original three months to three years, the investigators were furious. The 340 officials found guilty of fraud were able to return money even after their crime had been proven. The harshest punishment was the firing of twenty corrupt officials.

===Other roles===
On 31 July 1991, he was appointed Secretary of State at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland in the Esko Aho&#x27;s government. After the Gulf War, Ahtisaari headed a team tasked with reporting to the UN on changes in the situation and humanitarian needs. The report did not meet these expectations and was believed to have eroded American support for Ahtisaari&#x27;s candidacy for the UN Secretary-General.

Between 1992 and 1993, Ahtisaari chaired the UN Conference on Yugoslavia&#x27;s Working Group on Bosnia and Herzegovina and became the special assistant to Cyrus Vance, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Croatia.

== President of Finland (1994–2000)==



Finland&#x27;s ongoing recession caused established political figures to lose public support, and the presidential elections were now direct instead of being conducted through an electoral college. The Social Democratic Party of Finland&#x27;s candidate to succeed Mauno Koivisto as President of Finland was decided in a primary between Ahtisaari and former Prime Minister and diplomat Kalevi Sorsa. Ahtisaari led in the polls against Sorsa, who was already a popular and experienced politician and won the primaries on 16 May 1993 with 61% of the votes.

After the primaries, Ahtisaari returned to his work in Geneva, and did not start his presidential campaign until the end of October. Ahtisaari narrowly won over his second round opponent, Elisabeth Rehn of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party. During the campaign, there were rumours spread by some political opponents of Ahtisaari that he had a drinking problem or that he had knowingly accepted a double salary from the Finnish Foreign Ministry and from the United Nations while trying to negotiate an end to the Bosnian War. Ahtisaari denied both allegations and no firm proof of them has emerged. During the three-week campaign between the two rounds of presidential elections, Ahtisaari was praised by his supporters for being more compassionate towards the many unemployed Finns than Rehn, who as Defence Minister had to officially support the Aho government&#x27;s strict economic policies. A minor controversy arose during a town hall-style presidential debate in Lappeenranta, southeastern Finland when an apparently born-again Christian woman in the audience asked Rehn what her relationship with Jesus was. Rehn replied that she had personally no proof that Jesus had been a historical person. Ahtisaari ducked a precise answer by stating that he trusted the Lutheran confession even on this issue. He was sworn in on 1 March 1994.

His term as president began with a schism within the Centre Party government led by prime minister Esko Aho, who did not approve of Ahtisaari&#x27;s being actively involved in foreign policy. There was also some controversy over Ahtisaari&#x27;s speaking out on domestic issues such as unemployment. He travelled extensively in Finland and abroad, and was nicknamed &quot;Matka-Mara&quot; (&quot;Travel-Mara&quot;, Mara being a common diminutive form of Martti). His monthly travels throughout the country and his meetings with ordinary citizens (the so-called &quot;maakuntamatkat&quot; or &quot;provincial trips&quot;) nonetheless greatly enhanced his political popularity. Ahtisaari kept his campaign promise to visit one Finnish historical province every month during his presidency. He also donated some thousands of Finnish marks per month to the unemployed people&#x27;s organisations, and a few thousand Finnish marks to the Christian social organisation of the late lay preacher and social worker Veikko Hursti.

Ahtisaari favoured pluralism and religious tolerance publicly. Privately, he and his wife practised their Christian faith. Contrary to some of his predecessors and his successor as the Finnish President, Ahtisaari ended all of his New Year&#x27;s speeches by wishing the Finnish people God&#x27;s blessing.

In January 1998 Ahtisaari was criticized by some NGOs, politicians and notable cultural figures because he awarded Commander of the Order of the Lion of Finland to the Forest Minister of Indonesia and to the main owner of the Indonesian RGM Company, a parent company of the April Company. The April Company was criticized by non-governmental organisations for destroying rain forests, and Indonesia itself was criticized heavily for human rights violations, especially in East Timor. Ahtisaari&#x27;s party chairman Erkki Tuomioja said that giving medals was questionable since he feared the act may tarnish the public image of Finnish human rights policy. Students of the arts had demonstrations in Helsinki against the decision to give medals.

President Ahtisaari publicly supported Finland&#x27;s entry into the European Union, and in a 1994 referendum, 57 percent of Finnish voters were in favour of EU membership. He later stated that if Finland had not voted to join the EU he would have resigned. The promotion of a European collective security system and Nordic cooperation, as well as a security policy without membership of NATO, were central to Ahtisaari&#x27;s foreign policy.

During Ahtisaari&#x27;s term as president, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton met in Helsinki. He also negotiated alongside Viktor Chernomyrdin with Slobodan Milošević to end the fighting in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo in 1999.

Ahtisaari&#x27;s lack of restrained involvement in public affairs and his pronouncements on domestic and economic policy provoked reservations both in Parliament itself and in the Social Democratic Party of Finland, and led Ahtisaari not to stand for re-election in 2000, which was announced in April 1999, and also alleged that two members of the SDP also ran as candidates. Ahtisaari was the last &quot;strong president&quot;, before the 2000 constitution reduced the president&#x27;s powers. He was succeeded by Tarja Halonen on 1 March 2000.

== Post-presidential life ==
In Finnish politics, Ahtisaari long stressed how important it is for Finland to join NATO. Ahtisaari argued that Finland should be a full member of NATO and the EU in order &quot;to shrug off once and for all the burden of Finlandization&quot;. He believed politicians should file application and make Finland a member. He said that the way Finnish politicians avoided expressing their opinions was disturbing. He also noted that the so-called &quot;NATO option&quot; (acquiring membership if Finland were to be threatened) was an illusion, making an analogy to trying to obtain fire insurance when the fire has already started. Finland joined NATO on 4 April 2023, while Ahtisaari was still alive.

After leaving office, Ahtisaari held positions in various international organisations. In 2000, he became Chairman of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, an NGO to which he committed $100,000 in government funding in 1994 one month after becoming elected President of Finland. He remained Chairman Emeritus.

Ahtisaari also founded the independent Crisis Management Initiative (CMI) with the goal of developing and sustaining peace in troubled areas. On 1 December 2000, Ahtisaari was awarded the J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding by the Fulbright Association in recognition of his work as a peacemaker in some of the world&#x27;s most troubled areas. In May 2017 Ahtisaari suggested as new CMI leader Alexander Stubb a Finnish politician representing Finnish conservatives i.e. the National Coalition Party.

In 2000–01, Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa inspected IRA weapons dumps for the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, as part of the Northern Ireland peace process.

In 2003 Ahtisaari defended George W. Bush&#x27;s attack to Iraq, describing it as humanitarian intervention, which incited criticism from professor of history Juha Sihvola.

In November 2005, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Ahtisaari as Special Envoy for the Kosovo status process which was to determine whether Kosovo, having been administered by the United Nations since 1999, should become independent or remain a province of Serbia. In early 2006, Ahtisaari opened the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (UNOSEK) in Vienna, Austria, from where he conducted the Kosovo status negotiations. Those opposed to Ahtisaari&#x27;s settlement proposal, which involved an internationally monitored independence for Kosovo, sought to discredit him. Allegations made by Balkan media sources of corruption and improper conduct by Ahtisaari were described by US State Department spokesman Tom Casey as &quot;spurious&quot;, adding that Ahtisaari&#x27;s plan is the &quot;best solution possible&quot; and has the &quot;full endorsement of the United States&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that this criticism of Ahtisaari on the part of the Serbs had led to the &quot;bogging down&quot; of the Kosovo status talks. In November 2008, Serbian media reported Pierre Mirel, director of the EU enlargement commission&#x27;s western Balkans division as saying: &quot;The EU has accepted that the deployment of EULEX has to be approved by the United Nations Security Council, and that the mission has to be neutral and will not be related to the Ahtisaari plan,&quot; Mirel said, following his meeting with Serbia&#x27;s vice-president Bozidar Djelic.

In July 2007, however, when the EU, Russia and the United States agreed to find a new format for the talks, Ahtisaari announced that he regarded his mission as over. Since neither the UN nor the troika had asked him to continue mediations in the face of Russia&#x27;s persistent refusal to support independence for Kosovo, he said he would nonetheless be willing to take on &quot;a role as consultant&quot;, if requested. After a period of uncertainty and mounting tension, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in February 2008.

In his work, he emphasised the importance of the United States in the peace process, stating that &quot;There can be no peace without America.&quot;

Ahtisaari was chairman of the Interpeace Governing Council from 2000 to 2009. 
Beginning in 2009, Ahtisaari was Chairman Emeritus and a Special Advisor.

Ahtisaari was board director of the ImagineNations Group.
That same year he received the 2007 UNESCO Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize, for &quot;his lifetime contribution to world peace&quot;.

In September 2009 Ahtisaari joined The Elders, a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues. He travelled to the Korean Peninsula with fellow Elders Gro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson in April 2011, and to South Sudan with Robinson and Archbishop Desmond Tutu in July 2012.
He was also a member of the board of the European Council on Foreign Relations.

=== Syria conflict ===

In August 2012, Ahtisaari opined on the sectarian violence in Syria and was mentioned as a possible replacement as Joint Envoy there to succeed former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. However, Ahtisaari then told the Finnish state broadcaster YLE that &quot;he wished the mission would fall on someone else&quot; which it ultimately did in the person of Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister and longtime U.N. diplomat.

In late 2015, Martti Ahtisaari reiterated charges he already had made in an interview with German broadcaster Deutsche Welle in early 2013 against members of the UN security council on the obstruction of a political solution to the escalating conflict in Syria. Ahtisaari said in an interview in September 2015 that he held talks about Syria with envoys from the five permanent members of the UN security council in February 2012. According to Ahtisaari, Vitaly Churkin, Russian ambassador to the United Nations, laid out three points during a meeting with him, which included not arming the Syrian opposition, commencing talks between Syrian president Assad and the opposition and finding &quot;an elegant way for Assad to step aside&quot;. But the US, Britain and France subsequently ignored the proposal. Ahtisaari said in the interview: &quot;Nothing happened because I think all these, and many others, were convinced that Assad would be thrown out of office in a few weeks so there was no need to do anything.&quot;

==Personal life, health and death==
In 1968, he married Eeva Irmeli Hyvärinen, who was studying history at the University of Helsinki and whom he met as a child at the Lyceum in Kuopio. They had one son, Marko Ahtisaari, who was born in 1969.

On 24 March 2020, amid the large-scale outbreak of COVID-19, it was announced that Ahtisaari had tested positive for the disease. His spouse, Eeva Ahtisaari, was diagnosed with the same virus on 21 March. Eeva Ahtisaari had attended the International Women&#x27;s Day concert on 8 March at the Helsinki Music Centre while infected. On 14 April 2020 it was announced that Martti and Eeva Ahtisaari were recovering from the coronavirus infection.

On 2 September 2021, it was announced that Ahtisaari had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and had retired from public life. 

Ahtisaari died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in Helsinki, on 16 October 2023, at age 86. His state funeral was held on 10 November 2023 in Helsinki Cathedral at 1 p.m., after which he was buried at the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.

=== Nobel Peace Prize ===

On 10 October 2008, Ahtisaari was announced as that year&#x27;s recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Ahtisaari received the prize on 10 December 2008 at Oslo City Hall in Norway. Ahtisaari twice worked to find a solution in Kosovo – first in 1999 and again between 2005 and 2007. The committee said he also worked with others this year to find a peaceful solution to the problems in Iraq. According to the committee, Ahtisaari and his group, Crisis Management Initiative (CMI), also contributed to resolving other conflicts in Northern Ireland, Central Asia, and the Horn of Africa. Ahtisaari invited Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Stubb and others to his Nobel event, but not President Halonen.

According to the memoir of the former secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Geir Lundestad, former Foreign Minister and UN ambassador Keijo Korhonen, who was strongly against awarding the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize to Ahtisaari, wrote a letter to the committee which negatively portrayed Ahtisaari as a person and his merits in international conflict zones.

<doc id="164605" wikidata="Q12432978" url="?curid=164605" title="Geopotential height">
<text>Geopotential height or geopotential altitude is a vertical coordinate referenced to Earth&#x27;s mean sea level (assumed zero geopotential) that represents the work involved in lifting one unit of mass over one unit of length through a hypothetical space in which the acceleration of gravity is assumed constant.
In SI units, a geopotential height difference of one meter implies the vertical transport of a parcel of one kilogram; adopting the standard gravity value (9.80665 m/s2), it corresponds to a constant work or potential energy difference of 9.80665 joules. 

Geopotential height differs from geometric height (as given by a tape measure) because Earth&#x27;s gravity is not constant, varying markedly with altitude and latitude; thus, a 1-m geopotential height difference implies a different vertical distance in physical space: &quot;the unit-mass must be lifted higher at the equator than at the pole, if the same amount of work is to be performed&quot;.
It is a useful concept in meteorology, climatology, and oceanography; it also remains a historical convention in aeronautics as the altitude used for calibration of aircraft barometric altimeters.

==Definition==
&quot;Geopotential&quot; is the gravitational potential energy per unit mass at elevation formula_1:
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the acceleration due to gravity, formula_4 is latitude, and formula_1 is the geometric elevation.

Geopotential height may be obtained from normalizing geopotential by the acceleration of gravity:
:formula_6
where formula_7 = 9.80665 m/s2, the standard gravity at mean sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760017709.pdf&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Expressed in differential form, 
:formula_8

==Role in planetary fluids==
Geopotential height plays an important role in atmospheric and oceanographic studies.
The differential form above may be substituted into the hydrostatic equation and ideal gas law in order to relate pressure to ambient temperature and geopotential height for measurement by barometric altimeters regardless of latitude or geometric elevation:
:formula_9
:formula_10
where formula_11 and formula_12 are ambient pressure and temperature, respectively, as functions of geopotential height, and formula_13 is the specific gas constant. For the subsequent definite integral, the simplification obtained by assuming a constant value of gravitational acceleration is the sole reason for defining the geopotential altitude.

==Usage==

Geophysical sciences such as meteorology often prefer to express the horizontal pressure gradient force as the gradient of geopotential along a constant-pressure surface, because then it has the properties of a conservative force. For example, the primitive equations that weather forecast models solve use hydrostatic pressure as a vertical coordinate, and express the slopes of those pressure surfaces in terms of geopotential height. 

A plot of geopotential height for a single pressure level in the atmosphere shows the troughs and ridges (highs and lows) which are typically seen on upper air charts. The geopotential thickness between pressure levels – difference of the 850 hPa and 1000 hPa geopotential heights for example – is proportional to mean virtual temperature in that layer. Geopotential height contours can be used to calculate the geostrophic wind, which is faster where the contours are more closely spaced and tangential to the geopotential height contours.

The United States National Weather Service defines geopotential height as:

<text>Aksel Fredrik Airo (14 February 1898 – 9 May 1985) was a Finnish lieutenant general and main strategic planner during the Winter War and the Continuation War. He was the virtual second-in-command of the Finnish army under Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim.

He was born in Turku. As a young man he became a supporter of Finnish independence. His father changed the original, Swedish, family name Johansson to Airo (lit. &quot;oar&quot;).
During the Civil War in Finland (1918), Airo served in the artillery on the White side, taking part in battles near Viipuri. At the end of the war he was a lieutenant. Afterwards he was trained as an officer in Lappeenranta artillery school and was sponsored to the French military academy, École militaire in St.-Cyr in 1920. In 1921 he was accepted into École Supérieure de Guerre, the French officer training academy, from which he graduated as a captain in 1923, at the age of 27. Mannerheim invited him to join Finland&#x27;s Defense Council as a secretary.

Airo rose swiftly in rank, mainly because newly independent Finland needed suitable officers for the fledgling army. He had, however, some professional challenges because he was neither a Germany-trained Jaeger officer, nor one of the officers trained in the Tsar&#x27;s army during Russian rule. Still, by 1930 he had become a colonel.

In the beginning of the Winter War, Mannerheim appointed Airo as Quartermaster-General, and he was promoted to major general, and two years later to lieutenant general. On November 18, 1944, Marshal Mannerheim made him a Knight of the Mannerheim Cross in Order of the Cross of Liberty.

Airo was in the Mikkeli headquarters during the war and rarely went to the field. He was responsible for operational planning and the presentation of operations, or, as he allegedly said, &quot;The Marshal leads the war, but I lead the battles&quot;. They had many differences in opinion but still managed to work well together.

After the Continuation War, the now Communist-dominated Valpo (the Finnish State Police) arrested him for his alleged involvement in the so-called Weapons Cache Case. He was imprisoned for nearly three years, 1945 to 1948 without being sentenced, until president Juho Kusti Paasikivi released him. He said almost nothing about the affair afterwards and earned the moniker &quot;the silent general&quot;. The President relieved him of his duties with special permission to wear a military uniform.

In his later life Airo was a member of the parliament for the National Coalition Party and a presidential elector. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he never wrote memoirs about his war experiences. In 1982 President Mauno Koivisto awarded Airo with the Grand Cross of the Finnish Order of the White Rose with swords, which was a very rare honour in Finland. He died in 1985 at his home farm in Heinola.

<text>Sensible heat is heat exchanged by a body or thermodynamic system in which the exchange of heat changes the temperature of the body or system, and some macroscopic variables of the body or system, but leaves unchanged certain other macroscopic variables of the body or system, such as volume or pressure.

==Usage==

The term is used in contrast to a latent heat, which is the amount of heat exchanged that is hidden, meaning it occurs without change of temperature. For example, during a phase change such as the melting of ice, the temperature of the system containing the ice and the liquid is constant until all ice has melted. Latent and sensible heat are complementary terms. 

The sensible heat of a thermodynamic process may be calculated as the product of the body&#x27;s mass (&quot;m&quot;) with its specific heat capacity (&quot;c&quot;) and the change in temperature (formula_1):
:formula_2

&quot;Sensible heat&quot; and &quot;latent heat&quot; are not special forms of energy. Rather, they describe exchanges of heat under conditions specified in terms of their effect on a material or a thermodynamic system.

In the writings of the early scientists who provided the foundations of thermodynamics, sensible heat had a clear meaning in calorimetry. James Prescott Joule characterized it in 1847 as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer.

Both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes while transporting energy in nature. Latent heat is associated with changes of state, measured at constant temperature, especially the phase changes of atmospheric water vapor, mostly vaporization and condensation, whereas sensible heat directly affects the temperature of the atmosphere.

In meteorology, the term &#x27;sensible heat flux&#x27; means the conductive heat flux from the Earth&#x27;s surface to the atmosphere. It is an important component of Earth&#x27;s surface energy budget. Sensible heat flux is commonly measured with the eddy covariance method.

<text>Kyösti Kallio (, 10 April 1873 – 19 December 1940) was a Finnish politician who served as the fourth president of Finland from 1937 to 1940. His presidency included leading the country through the Winter War; while he relinquished the post of commander-in-chief to Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, he played a role as a spiritual leader. After the war, he became both the first President of Finland to resign and the only one to die in office, dying of a heart attack while returning home after submitting his resignation.

Kallio was the only president of Finland who did not have an academic or similar degree. He was a prominent leader of the Agrarian League party, and served as Prime Minister four times and Speaker of the Parliament six times. During his political career, he also served as a five-time Minister of Agriculture for most of the period between 1917 and 1922, including in the Independence Senate and the Civil War-era White cabinet, led a 1922 land reform to aid tenant farmers in acquiring their own land, and was a candidate in the 1931 presidential election before defeating incumbent president Pehr Evind Svinhufvud in the subsequent elections of 1937.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kyösti Kallio, originally &quot;Gustaf Kalliokangas&quot; ( , ), was born in Ylivieska, Grand Duchy of Finland, which was an autonomous region of the Russian Empire at the time. His father Mikko Kalliokangas was a farmer and prominent local politician. Young Kyösti&#x27;s life also included his father&#x27;s unmarried and childless cousin, Anttuuna Kangas, or aunt Anttuuna, who arranged for the boy to go to Raahe&#x27;s junior high school in 1886. After that, he was educated in Oulu where he became acquainted with Santeri Alkio, author and future ideologue of the Agrarian League.

===Start of career===
Kallio entered politics during the first Russification campaign of Finland as a member of the Young Finnish Party. He served in the Diet of Finland from 1904 to 1906 as a member of the Estate of the Peasantry. He joined the newly founded Agrarian League in 1906 and became one of its most prominent leaders.

===Finland gains independence===
After the February Revolution of 1917 dethroned Tsar Nicholas II, the Russian provisional government tasked Vice Admiral Adrian Nepenin with overseeing the change of government in Finland. Nepenin started by inviting a handful of Finnish politicians to discuss the situation on March 17. Kallio represented the Agrarian League; and when the Finnish politicians the next day sent a delegation to Saint Petersburg to negotiate a cessation to the Russification campaign, Kallio was again a member. The delegation was successful, and Finland was permitted to assemble a fully parliamentary Senate. Kallio came to serve as Agrarian minister in the Senate of Oskari Tokoi, which took office March 26. Most of his time was spent trying to mediate the agrarian strikes and finding foodstuffs for the country, while the First World War raised the prices in Europe.

After the Tsar had been dethroned, the Finnish Parliament had to decide whether the highest authority in the country had passed on to the Russian Provisional Government, the Finnish Parliament, or the Finnish Senate. The question led to serious strife between the right-wing and left-wing elements of the Parliament. Kallio initially supported the socialists in demanding that power transfer to the Parliament, but disapproved of their cooperation with Russian Bolsheviks and Mensheviks; and Kallio ultimately voted against the bill they had drafted. Nonetheless, the socialist proposal passed, which the Russian Provisional Government saw as an affront to their power; and Alexander Kerensky consequently dissolved the Finnish Parliament on September 8. Kallio and the Socialist senators resigned from the senate, which continued to operate under the leadership of E. N. Setälä.

After the October Revolution, the Finnish bourgeoisie were willing to compromise and give parliament the highest authority fearing Bolshevik rule would spread to Finland. Setälä&#x27;s Senate resigned immediately after the question was settled. Kallio was again named Agrarian Minister in the Senate of P. E. Svinhufvud whose first priority was to declare Finland independent. On December 4 the Senate introduced a declaration of independence to the Parliament; and the next day Kallio wrote a resolution, which the Parliament passed with votes 100–88.

===Civil war===
During the Civil War in Finland, Kallio hid in red-dominated Helsinki, because he was at least nominally on the white side and therefore a &quot;class enemy&quot;; he formed a new senate (government) in Helsinki after German troops had defeated the reds in the city. Afterwards he became a moderate peace-maker and disapproved of retaliation against the reds. In his reconciliation speech in Nivala, Kallio said the following:

===Formation of the republic===
During the debates over the form of the new state in 1918, Kallio resigned from the senate because he supported a republic instead of constitutional monarchy. Eventually, the monarchist stand lost, and he returned to the Cabinet to become prime minister. He was a reformist who emphasized education, settlement, and land reform. His greatest achievement was &quot;Lex Kallio&quot; in 1922, legislation allowing the state to buy land to encourage new settlements, and to let the former tenant farmers and other landless rural people buy small farms (see, for example, Seppo Zetterberg et al., ed., &quot;Suomen historian pikkujättiläinen&quot;).

===Supported prohibition===
He supported prohibition in Finland, and was dismayed when it was repealed in 1932.

===Non-violent anti-communist===
Kallio was an anti-communist, suppressing the Communist Party of Finland (SKP) in 1923. However, he resorted to legislative methods. When the violent right-wing Lapua Movement asked him to become their leader, he refused and was then instead subjected to their death threats.

===President===
Kallio was elected president with the votes of a centrist (Agrarian and Progressive) and social democratic coalition, which wanted to ensure that President Svinhufvud would not be re-elected. Kallio took the role of a parliamentarian president and avoided use of his personal power.

On the eve of the Winter War, when Marshal Mannerheim once again threatened to resign from his post as chairman of Finland&#x27;s Defence Council due to a schism with the cabinet, Kallio convinced him to stay. During the war Kallio resisted the idea of giving up any territory to the Soviet Union, but was forced to agree to sign the Moscow Peace Treaty in 1940. His health began to fail – and his right arm was paralyzed – He was not active in the dealings with Germany leading to the Continuation War. On 27 August Kallio suffered a serious stroke. Prime Minister Risto Ryti took over his duties. Kallio&#x27;s heart became weak while he knowingly took risks by agreeing to the formal farewell ceremonies.

===Resignation and death===

Kallio left a notice of resignation on 27 November 1940. He was planning to leave the capital and retire to his farm at Nivala after the farewell ceremonies on the evening of 19 December 1940; but he collapsed and died that night at the Helsinki Central Railway Station in the arms of his adjutant before a guard of honour while a band played the patriotic Finnish march Porilaisten marssi. One story tells that Kallio died in the arms of Marshal Mannerheim, but this is most likely part of the construction of Mannerheim&#x27;s personal cult. In reality, Kallio died in the arms of his adjutant Aladár Paasonen and colonel A. F. Airo.

==Religious views==

A significant part of Kallio&#x27;s personality and a motive for the social reforms which he supported and promoted was his deep Christian faith, which he had adopted already at home, and which was deepened during his marriage to Kaisa Nivala, who was also a devout Christian. Although Kallio was often too busy to go to church, he prayed often when encountering difficulties in making political decisions, and some of these prayers he recorded in his diary. He also read Christian books with his wife and often discussed them by exchanging letters. He often referred to God in his speeches, and during the Winter War he asked the Finns who were serving their country to read the Bible. When he was forced to sign the harsh Moscow Peace Treaty in March 1940, Kallio quoted freely from the Book of Zechariah, saying: His right arm was paralysed the following summer, and he was forced to switch his writing hand. In the Presidential Palace, shortly before leaving for Helsinki Central Railway Station for the last time, Kallio sang a hymn with his family.
==Supplemental biography==
Kyösti Kallio was deeply religious - he came from a pietist family - and was an absolute teetotaller. In 1932 he took the repellation of prohibition in Finland that had been in force since 1919 as a personal defeat. When Kallio was visiting the parliament of Hungary in his role as speaker of the parliament of Finland, he caused a complete shock to his hosts by requesting milk to drink at the official banquet. When Kallio became president, the largest change in the presidential palace in Finland was the complete stop of serving alcoholic beverages in all events. In addition, there was no dancing at any Indendence Day Reception during Kallio&#x27;s time as president. When appointing Kaarlo Hillilä as the governor of the Lapland Province Kallio made him promise not to drink any alcohol. Kaisa Kallio&#x27;s loom was taken into the presidential palace into the same room where Ellen Svinhufvud&#x27;s loom had been taken away from shortly before.

When a condolence petition was being assembled in Nivala in 1904 in memory of the recently assassinated governor-general Nikolay Bobrikov, Kallio snatched the paper from the hand of the petitioner, tore it into pieces in front of him and threw it into the fire.

Kallio&#x27;s religiousness and abstinence from alcohol gave him an image of a solemn and narrow-minded person. However, his close friends have described him as a social person who understood intelligent wordplay. In appropriate company, Kallio indulged in good-natured humour. In his youth, Kallio&#x27;s favourite sport was cross-country skiing, and he won numerous prizes in skiing competitions. In his older years, Kallio raised racehorses, and even in his years as a government minister he successfully took part in races. In addition to this, Kallio had time to attend theatre plays and concerts.

==In popular culture==
Kallio was played by Ossi Ahlapuro in the 2001 television film &quot;Valtapeliä elokuussa 1940&quot;, directed by Veli-Matti Saikkonen.

<text>Latent heat (also known as latent energy or heat of transformation) is energy released or absorbed, by a body or a thermodynamic system, during a constant-temperature process—usually a first-order phase transition, like melting or condensation.

Latent heat can be understood as hidden energy which is supplied or extracted to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature or pressure. This includes the latent heat of fusion (solid to liquid), the latent heat of vaporization (liquid to gas) and the latent heat of sublimation (solid to gas).

The term was introduced around 1762 by Scottish chemist Joseph Black. Black used the term in the context of calorimetry where a heat transfer caused a volume change in a body while its temperature was constant.

In contrast to latent heat, sensible heat is energy transferred as heat, with a resultant temperature change in a body.

==Usage==

The terms &quot;sensible heat&quot; and &quot;latent heat&quot; refer to energy transferred between a body and its surroundings, defined by the occurrence or non-occurrence of temperature change; they depend on the properties of the body. Sensible heat is sensed or felt in a process as a change in the body&#x27;s temperature. Latent heat is energy transferred in a process without change of the body&#x27;s temperature, for example, in a phase change (solid/liquid/gas).

Both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes of transfer of energy in nature. Latent heat is associated with the change of phase of atmospheric or ocean water, vaporization, condensation, freezing or melting, whereas sensible heat is energy transferred that is evident in change of the temperature of the atmosphere or ocean, or ice, without those phase changes, though it is associated with changes of pressure and volume.

The original usage of the term, as introduced by Black, was applied to systems that were intentionally held at constant temperature. Such usage referred to &quot;latent heat of expansion&quot; and several other related latent heats. These latent heats are defined independently of the conceptual framework of thermodynamics.

When a body is heated at constant temperature by thermal radiation in a microwave field for example, it may expand by an amount described by its &quot;latent heat with respect to volume&quot; or &quot;latent heat of expansion&quot;, or increase its pressure by an amount described by its &quot;latent heat with respect to pressure&quot;.

Latent heat is energy released or absorbed by a body or a thermodynamic system during a constant-temperature process. Two common forms of latent heat are latent heat of fusion (melting) and latent heat of vaporization (boiling). These names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase to the next: from solid to liquid, and liquid to gas.

In both cases the change is endothermic, meaning that the system absorbs energy. For example, when water evaporates, an input of energy is required for the water molecules to overcome the forces of attraction between them and make the transition from water to vapor.

If the vapor then condenses to a liquid on a surface, then the vapor&#x27;s latent energy absorbed during evaporation is released as the liquid&#x27;s sensible heat onto the surface.

The large value of the enthalpy of condensation of water vapor is the reason that steam is a far more effective heating medium than boiling water, and is more hazardous.

===Meteorology===
In meteorology, latent heat flux is the flux of energy from the Earth&#x27;s surface to the atmosphere that is associated with evaporation or transpiration of water at the surface and subsequent condensation of water vapor in the troposphere. It is an important component of Earth&#x27;s surface energy budget. Latent heat flux has been commonly measured with the Bowen ratio technique, or more recently since the mid-1900s by the eddy covariance method.

==History==

=== Background ===

==== Evaporative cooling ====

In 1748, an account was published in &quot;The Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays&quot; of an experiment by the Scottish physician and chemist William Cullen. Cullen had used an air pump to lower the pressure in a container with diethyl ether. No heat was withdrawn from the ether, yet the ether boiled, but its temperature decreased. And in 1758, on a warm day in Cambridge, England, Benjamin Franklin and fellow scientist John Hadley experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury thermometer with ether and using bellows to evaporate the ether. With each subsequent evaporation, the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching . Another thermometer showed that the room temperature was constant at . In his letter &quot;Cooling by Evaporation&quot;, Franklin noted that, &quot;One may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer&#x27;s day.&quot; 

=== Latent heat ===

The English word &quot;&quot; comes from Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;lying hidden&quot;. The term &quot;latent heat&quot; was introduced into calorimetry around 1750 by Joseph Black, commissioned by producers of Scotch whisky in search of ideal quantities of fuel and water for their distilling process to study system changes, such as of volume and pressure, when the thermodynamic system was held at constant temperature in a thermal bath. 

It was known that when the air temperature rises above freezing—air then becoming the obvious heat source—snow melts very slowly and the temperature of the melted snow is close to its freezing point. In 1757, Black started to investigate if heat, therefore, was required for the melting of a solid, independent of any rise in temperature. As far Black knew, the general view at that time was that melting was inevitably accompanied by a small increase in temperature, and that no additional heat was needed beyond what this increase in temperature would require in itself. Soon, however, Black was able to show that much more heat was required during melting than could be explained by the increase in temperature alone. He was also able to show that heat is released by a liquid during its freezing; again, much more than could be explained by the decrease of its temperature alone.

Black would compare the change in temperature of two identical quantities of water, heated by identical means, one of which was, say, melted from ice, whereas the other was heated from merely cold liquid state. By comparing the resulting temperatures, he could conclude that, for instance, the temperature of the sample melted from ice was 140 °F lower than the other sample, thus melting the ice absorbed 140 &quot;degrees of heat&quot; that could not be measured by the thermometer, yet needed to be supplied, thus it was &quot;latent&quot; (hidden). Black also deduced that as much latent heat as was supplied into boiling the distillate (thus giving the quantity of fuel needed) also had to be absorbed to condense it again (thus giving the cooling water required).

==== Quantifying latent heat ====
In 1762, Black announced the following research and results to a society of professors at the University of Glasgow. Black had placed equal masses of ice at 32 °F (0 °C) and water at 33 °F (0.6 °C) respectively in two identical, well separated containers. The water and the ice were both evenly heated to 40 °F by the air in the room, which was at a constant 47 °F (8 °C). The water had therefore received 40 – 33 = 7 “degrees of heat”. The ice had been heated for 21 times longer and had therefore received 7 × 21 = 147 “degrees of heat”. The temperature of the ice had increased by 8 °F. The ice had thus absorbed 8 “degrees of heat”, which Black called &quot;sensible heat&quot;, manifest as a temperature increase, which could be felt and measured. In addition to that, 147 – 8 = 139 “degrees of heat” were absorbed as &quot;latent heat&quot;, manifest as phase change rather than as temperature change. 

Black next showed that a water temperature of 176 °F was needed to melt an equal mass of ice until it was all 32 °F. So now 176 – 32 = 144 “degrees of heat” seemed to be needed to melt the ice. The modern value for the heat of fusion of ice would be 143 “degrees of heat” on the same scale (79.5 “degrees of heat Celsius”). 

Finally, Black increased the temperature of a mass of water, then vaporized an equal mass of water by even heating. He showed that 830 “degrees of heat” was needed for the vaporization; again based on the time required. The modern value for the heat of vaporization of water would be 967 “degrees of heat” on the same scale.

=== James Prescott Joule ===
Later, James Prescott Joule characterised latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles, i.e. a form of potential energy, and the sensible heat as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer, relating the latter to thermal energy.

==Specific latent heat==
A &quot;specific&quot; latent heat (&quot;L&quot;) expresses the amount of energy in the form of heat (&quot;Q&quot;) required to completely effect a phase change of a unit of mass (&quot;m&quot;), usually , of a substance as an intensive property:
:formula_1
Intensive properties are material characteristics and are not dependent on the size or extent of the sample. Commonly quoted and tabulated in the literature are the specific latent heat of fusion and the specific latent heat of vaporization for many substances.

From this definition, the latent heat for a given mass of a substance is calculated by
:formula_2
where:
:&quot;Q&quot; is the amount of energy released or absorbed during the change of phase of the substance (in kJ or in BTU),
:&quot;m&quot; is the mass of the substance (in kg or in lb), and
:&quot;L&quot; is the specific latent heat for a particular substance (in kJ kg−1 or in BTU lb−1), either &quot;L&quot;f for fusion, or &quot;L&quot;v for vaporization.

==Table of specific latent heats==
The following table shows the specific latent heats and change of phase temperatures (at standard pressure) of some common fluids and gases.
==Specific latent heat for condensation of water in clouds==

The specific latent heat of condensation of water in the temperature range from −25 °C to 40 °C is approximated by the following empirical cubic function:
:formula_3

where the temperature formula_4 is taken to be the numerical value in °C.

For sublimation and deposition from and into ice, the specific latent heat is almost constant in the temperature range from −40 °C to 0 °C and can be approximated by the following empirical quadratic function:
:formula_5

==Variation with temperature (or pressure)==
As the temperature (or pressure) rises to the critical point, the latent heat of vaporization falls to zero.

<doc id="164612" wikidata="Q1190983" url="?curid=164612" title="Japanese bondage">
<text>&#x27; means &quot;tight binding&quot;, while &#x27; literally means &quot;the beauty of tight binding&quot;. is a Japanese style of bondage or BDSM which involves tying a person up using simple yet visually intricate patterns, usually with several pieces of thin rope (often jute, hemp or linen and generally around in diameter, but sometimes as small as , and between long). In Japanese this natural-fibre rope is known as . The allusion is to the use of hemp rope for restraining prisoners, as a symbol of power, in the same way that stocks or manacles are used in a Western BDSM context.

The word came into common use in the West at some point in the 1990s to describe the bondage art Kinbaku.  is a Japanese word that broadly means &quot;binding&quot; or &quot;tying&quot; in most contexts, but is used in BDSM to refer to this style of decorative bondage.

Shibari and Kinbaku focuses on the aesthetics and display of the body. As a result, and due to the manipulation of body parts using rope to achieve this, it is common, though not always required, for models or participants to be fully naked and the art form regularly incorporates aspects of BDSM such as erotic humiliation. It may be used for restraint as well as solely being a visual.

== History ==
Bondage as a sexual activity first came to notice in Japan in the late Edo period (about 1600s to 1860s). Generally recognized as &quot;father of Kinbaku&quot;, Seiu Ito, started studying and researching &quot;Hojōjutsu&quot; (the art of binding a prisoner of war) and is credited with the inception of Kinbaku, though it is noted that he drew inspiration from other art forms of the time including Kabuki theatre and Ukiyoe woodblock prints. Kinbaku became widely popular in Japan in the 1950s through magazines such as &quot;Kitan Club&quot; and &quot;Yomikiri Romance&quot;, which published the first naked bondage photographs. In the 1960s, people such as Eikichi Osada began to appear performing live SM shows often including a large amount of rope bondage, today these performers are often referred to as &quot;Nawashi&quot; (rope master) or &quot;Bakushi&quot; (from &quot;kinbakushi&quot;, meaning bondage master).

&quot;Kinbaku&quot; has become popular in the Western BDSM scene in its own right and has influenced Western-style bondage.

== Rope types ==
In Japan the most often used type of rope is a loose laid, three strand jute rope. This rope is referred to as &quot;Asanawa&quot; usually translated as &quot;hemp rope&quot; the word &#x27;asa&#x27; as hemp and &#x27;nawa&#x27; as rope, however this is using the more generic form of the word [hemp] referring to a range of natural fibre ropes rather than those pertaining to a particular plant.
In recent history a range of rope types have been used for Kinbaku in Japan though Nawashi rarely use synthetic fibre rope and most often use jute.

Kinbaku is practised with ropes of in length. Due to the generally larger physique of Western subjects, ropes are commonly used in the West. Though the rope material is usually jute (or hemp) many other materials are in use including cotton and various synthetics. Various techniques are used to make the natural fiber ropes softer.

Synthetic ropes have become popular in the US for the vibrant colors which are available and ease of washing. Most commonly 6mm diameter, but also 8mm diameter and other sizes. The most common standard length is 30 feet or ten meters, however many vendors provide custom lengths.

== Aesthetics of Japanese bondage ==
The aesthetics of the bound person&#x27;s position is important: in particular, Japanese bondage is distinguished by its use of specific &quot;katas&quot; (forms) and aesthetic rules. Sometimes, asymmetric and often intentionally uncomfortable positions are employed. In particular, Japanese bondage is very much about the way the rope is applied and the pleasure is more in the journey than the destination. In this way the rope becomes an extension of the nawashi&#x27;s hands and is used to communicate.

Traditional Japanese bondage techniques use natural vegetable fiber rope (hemp, jute, or linen) exclusively, though contemporary Japanese Masters have been working with a range of rope materials. The natural fibers easily lock to each other which means the bondage can be held together by the friction of twists and turns or very simple knots.

== Shibari in contemporary art ==
Shibari has a strong presence in the works of some renowned contemporary artists, mainly photographers, like Nobuyoshi Araki in Japan, Jim Duvall in the United States and Hikari Kesho in Europe.

In 2014, Romanian singer-songwriter NAVI released a Shibari-themed music video, &quot;Picture Perfect&quot;. The video, directed by Marian Nica, was controversial and banned by Romanian television for its explicit erotic content.

Shibari has also featured in Western pop culture. For example, in the music video for The Jonas Brothers song &quot;Sucker&quot;, Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner briefly appear to be engaging in a form of Japanese-inspired bondage. More to the point, shibari is explicitly referenced in &quot;Tying the Knot&quot;, the nineteenth episode of &quot;The Good Wife&quot;″s fifth season, as the practice of shibari is integral to the episode&#x27;s plot; in this episode, fictional characters Colin Sweeney and Renata Ellard Sweeney (portrayed by actors Dylan Baker and Laura Benanti respectively) are revealed to engage in the art of shibari, and shibari is also used as a means by which Renata&#x27;s friend, Morgan Donnelly (portrayed by actress Jenn Gambatese), is murdered.

One modern distinction that has gained popularity among westerners wanting to distinguish the terms is that &quot;shibari&quot; refers to purely artistic, aesthetic rope, while &quot;kinbaku&quot; refers to the artistic, connective, sensual, sexual practice as a whole. While multiple books and articles have been written in Japanese about shibari, no one has found evidence of there being any thought given to the distinction between these words among Japanese practitioners of the art.

A traditional view is that the term is a Western misuse of Japanese vocabulary. The word denotes tying in Japanese, but in a generic way, and traditionally not in the context of bondage. The names for many particular ties include , but it was not traditional to name the entire activity in that way. Instead, is the term for artistic or erotic tying within traditional Japanese rope bondage circles. 
An even more traditional view is that &quot;shibari&quot; is a term used for erotic bondage in Japan that is practically interchangeable with the term &quot;kinbaku&quot;. Itoh Seiu (generally considered one of the fathers of contemporary Japanese rope bondage) used the term in the 1950s, with no sign of it being a &quot;western Japonism&quot; as did many other well-known Japanese . One of Nureki Chimuo&#x27;s how-to video series from the 1980s, is titled Introduction to Shibari.

While some claim this is a somewhat hidebound definition and the word &quot;shibari&quot; is now increasingly being re-imported from the West to Japan, as the tying communities are very close-knit, there is no evidence to support such a conclusion as most practicing in Japan have very limited contact with the west and almost no interest in debating the meaning of words. Most Japanese do not object to the term , as it is common vernacular in the global community.

The actual term &quot;Kinbaku&quot; was first developed and used in the May–June 1952 issue of Kitan Club by author and Bakushi Minomura Kou and Bakushi Tsujimura Takashi. Until that issue, most magazines only had nude photographs of women but few in bondage. In order to specify the act of erotic bondage as opposed to the act of just tying Kinbaku was then created by the aforementioned Bakushi.

== Technique ==
Kinbaku is based on fairly specific rope patterns, many of them derived from Hojojutsu ties though significantly modified to make them safer for bondage use. Many Hojojutsu ties were deliberately designed to cause harm to a prisoner and are therefore not suitable for erotic bondage. Of particular importance are the Ushiro Takatekote (a type of box tie which surrounds the chest and arms), which forms the basis of many Kinbaku ties, and the Ebi-tie, or &quot;Shrimp&quot;, which was originally designed as a torture tie and codified as part of the Edo period torture techniques. Today the ebi-tie is used as part of BDSM play and can be considered a form of , rope torture.

== Glossary ==
* : (noun) literally &quot;tight binding&quot;. It does not convey the meaning of sexual bondage outside BDSM circles. However, some experts, e.g. Kinoko Hajime and Osada Steve, make a distinction from &quot;shibari&quot; in that it is used to refer to sessions with a strong emotional exchange.
* : (noun) kinbaku master, can be shortened to bakushi.
* : (noun) the act of tying, binding or weaving. It does not convey the meaning of sexual bondage outside BDSM circles.
* : (verb) tie or bind with a rope
* : (noun) rope-tying with a rope (an incorrect, &quot;made-up&quot; term, does not exist in Japanese)
* : (noun) literally, &quot;a maker of rope&quot;, but in BDSM circles it means a professional &quot;rope artist&quot;

<doc id="164614" wikidata="Q152306" url="?curid=164614" title="Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim">
<text>Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (, 4 June 1867 – 27 January 1951) was a Finnish military commander, aristocrat, and statesman. He served as the military leader of the Whites in the Finnish Civil War (1918), as Regent of Finland (1918–1919), as commander-in-chief of the Finnish Defence Forces during the period of World War II (1939–1945), and as the sixth president of Finland (1944–1946). He became Finland&#x27;s only field marshal in 1933 and was appointed honorary Marshal of Finland in 1942.

The Russian Empire still dominated the Grand Duchy of Finland during Mannerheim&#x27;s childhood, and Mannerheim made a career in the Imperial Russian Army, serving in the Russo-Japanese War and the Eastern Front of World War I and rising by 1917 to the rank of lieutenant general. He had a prominent place in the 1896 coronation ceremonies for Emperor Nicholas II and later had several private meetings with the Tsar. After the Bolshevik coup of November 1917 in Russia, Finland declared its independence on 6 December, but soon became embroiled in the 1918 Finnish Civil War between the &quot;Whites&quot;, who were the troops of the Senate of Finland, supported by troops of the German Empire, and the pro-Bolshevik &quot;Reds&quot;.

A Finnish delegation appointed Mannerheim as the military chief of the Whites in January 1918; and he led them to victory, holding a triumphal victory parade in Helsinki in May. After spending some time abroad, he was invited back to Finland to serve as the country&#x27;s second regent, or head of state, from December 1918 to July 1919. Despite being a monarchist, he formally ratified the republican Constitution of Finland. He then ran against K. J. Ståhlberg in the first Finnish presidential elections in 1919 but lost and quit politics. Mannerheim helped found the Mannerheim League for Child Welfare in 1920 and headed the Finnish Red Cross from 1922 to his death. He was restored to a central role in national defence policy when President Svinhufvud appointed him as the Chairman of the Finnish Defence Council in 1931, tasked with making preparations for a potential war with the Soviet Union. It was also agreed that he would temporarily take over as commander-in-chief of the country&#x27;s armed forces should there be a war.

Accordingly, after the Soviets invaded Finland in November 1939 in what became the Winter War, Mannerheim replaced President Kyösti Kallio as commander-in-chief, and occupied the post for the next five years. He became a unifying symbol of the war effort and part of the core leadership of the country. He personally participated in the planning of Operation Barbarossa and led the Finnish Defence Forces in an invasion of the Soviet Union alongside Nazi Germany known as the Continuation War (1941–1944). In 1944, when the prospect of Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II became clear, the Finnish Parliament appointed Mannerheim as President of Finland, and he oversaw peace negotiations with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. Already in declining health, he resigned the presidency in 1946 and spent much of his remaining life in a sanatorium in Switzerland, where he wrote his memoirs, and where he died in 1951.

Participants in a Finnish survey taken 53 years after his death voted Mannerheim the greatest Finn of all time. During his own lifetime he became, alongside Jean Sibelius, the best-known Finnish personage at home and abroad. According to Finnish historian Tuomas Tepora, a cult of personality began to be built around Mannerheim right after the civil war.

Given the broad recognition in Finland and elsewhere of his unparalleled role in establishing and later preserving Finland&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union, Mannerheim has long been referred to as the father of modern Finland, and the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the Finnish capital Helsinki&#x27;s Mannerheim Museum, memorializing the leader&#x27;s life and times, &quot;the closest thing there is to a [Finnish] national shrine&quot;.

==Early life and military career==

===Ancestry===
The Mannerheims, originally from Germany as &quot;Marhein&quot;, became Swedish noblemen in 1693. In the latter part of the 18th century, they moved to Finland, which was then an integral part of Sweden. After Sweden lost Finland to the Russian Empire in 1809, Mannerheim&#x27;s great-grandfather, Count Carl Erik Mannerheim (1759–1837), son of the Commandant Johan Augustin Mannerheim, became the first head of the executive of the newly-autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, an office that preceded that of the contemporary Prime Minister. His grandfather, Carl Gustaf Mannerheim (1797–1854), was an entomologist and jurist. His father, Carl Robert, Count Mannerheim (1835–1914), was both a playwright and industrialist, with modest success in both endeavours. Mannerheim&#x27;s mother, Hedvig Charlotta Helena von Julin (1842–1881), was the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, John von Julin (1787–1853).

===Childhood===

Gustaf Mannerheim was born in the Louhisaari Manor of the Askainen parish (current Masku) on 4 June 1867. After Mannerheim&#x27;s father left the family in 1880 for his mistress, a daughter of Baron and General Johan Mauritz Nordenstam, the young Mannerheim&#x27;s mother and her seven children went to live with her aunt Louise; but Mannerheim&#x27;s mother died the following year. Mannerheim&#x27;s maternal uncle, Albert von Julin (1846–1906), then became his legal guardian and financier of his later schooling. The third child of the family, Mannerheim inherited the title of Baron.

===Education===

Mannerheim was sent to the Hamina Cadet School, a state school educating aristocrats for the Imperial Russian Army, in 1882. The handsome young Baron towered over his classmates, standing . He was expelled in 1886 when he left without permission. Next he attended the Helsinki Private Lyceum, where he passed the university entrance examinations in June 1887. From 1887 to 1889, Mannerheim attended the Nicholas Cavalry College in Saint Petersburg. In January 1891, he joined the Chevalier Guard Regiment in Saint Petersburg.

===Service in the Imperial Russian Army===
Mannerheim served in the Imperial Chevalier Guard until 1904. In 1896, he took part in the coronation of Emperor Nicholas II, standing for four hours in his full-dress Imperial Chevalier Guard uniform at the bottom of the steps leading up to the imperial throne. Mannerheim always considered the coronation a high-point of his life, recalling with pride his role in what he called an &quot;indescribably magnificent&quot; coronation. An expert rider and trained horseman, Mannerheim bought horses for the Russian army as one of his official duties. In 1903, he was put in charge of the model squadron in the Imperial Chevalier Guard and became a member of the equestrian training board of the cavalry regiments.

Mannerheim volunteered for active service with the Imperial Russian Army in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. He was transferred to the 52nd Nezhin Dragoon Regiment in Manchuria, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. During a reconnaissance patrol on the plains of Manchuria, he first saw action in a skirmish and had his horse shot out from under him. He was promoted to Colonel for bravery in the Battle of Mukden in 1905 and briefly commanded an irregular unit of &quot;Hong Huzi&quot;, a local militia, on an exploratory mission into Inner Mongolia. During the war, Mannerheim also managed to lead a group of local bandits with whom he sought the rear of the enemy to defeat them.

Mannerheim, who had a long career in the Imperial Russian army, also rose to become a courtier of Emperor of all the Russias Nicholas II. When Mannerheim returned to Saint Petersburg, he was asked to undertake a journey through Turkestan to Beijing as a secret intelligence officer. The Russian General Staff wanted accurate, on-the-ground intelligence about the reforms and activities by the Qing dynasty, as well as the military feasibility of invading Western China: a possible move in their struggle with Britain for control of inner Asia. Disguised as an ethnographic collector, he joined the French archeologist Paul Pelliot&#x27;s expedition at Samarkand in Russian Turkestan (now Uzbekistan). They started from the terminus of the Trans-Caspian Railway in Andijan in July 1906, but Mannerheim quarreled with Pelliot, so he made the greater part of the expedition on his own.

With a small caravan, including a Cossack guide, Chinese interpreter, and Uyghur cook, Mannerheim first trekked to Khotan in search of British and Japanese spies. After returning to Kashgar, he headed north into the Tian Shan range, surveying passes and gauging the stances of the tribes towards the Han Chinese. Mannerheim arrived in the provincial capital of Urumqi, and then headed east into Gansu province. At the sacred Buddhist mountain of Mount Wutai in Shanxi province, Mannerheim met the 13th Dalai Lama of Tibet. He showed the Dalai Lama how to use a pistol.

He followed the Great Wall of China, and investigated a mysterious tribe known as Yugurs. From Lanzhou, the provincial capital, Mannerheim headed south into Tibetan territory and visited the lamasery of Labrang, where he was stoned by xenophobic monks. During his trip to Tibet in 1908 Mannerheim became the third European who had met with the Dalai Lama. Mannerheim arrived in Beijing in July 1908, returning to Saint Petersburg via Japan and the Trans-Siberian Express. His report gave a detailed account of Chinese modernization, covering education, military reforms, colonization of ethnic borderlands, mining and industry, railway construction, the influence of Japan, and opium smoking. He also discussed the possibility of a Russian invasion of Xinjiang, and Xinjiang&#x27;s possible role as a bargaining chip in a putative future war with China. His trip through Asia left him with a lifelong love of Asian art, which he thereafter collected.

After returning to Russia in 1909, Mannerheim presented results of the expedition to Emperor Nicholas II. There are many artifacts still on display in the museum. After that, Mannerheim was appointed to command the 13th Vladimir Uhlan Regiment in the Congress Kingdom of Poland. The following year, he was promoted to major general and was posted as the commander of the Life Guard Uhlan Regiment of His Imperial Majesty in Warsaw. Next Mannerheim became part of the Imperial entourage and was appointed to command a cavalry brigade.

At the beginning of World War I, Mannerheim served as commander of the Separate Guards Cavalry Brigade (the 23rd Army Corps), and fought on the Austro-Hungarian and Romanian fronts. In December 1914, after distinguishing himself in combat against the Austro-Hungarian forces, Mannerheim was awarded the Order of St. George, 4th class. In March 1915, Mannerheim was appointed to command the 12th Cavalry Division.

Mannerheim received leave to visit Finland and Saint Petersburg in early 1917 and witnessed the outbreak of the February Revolution. After returning to the front, he was promoted to lieutenant general in April 1917 (the promotion was backdated to February 1915), and took command of the 6th Cavalry Corps in the summer of 1917. However, Mannerheim fell out of favour with the new government, who regarded him as not supporting the revolution, and was relieved of his duties. He retired and returned to Finland. Mannerheim kept a large portrait of Emperor Nicholas II in the living room of his house in Helsinki right up to his death, and when asked after the overthrow of the House of Romanov why he kept the portrait up, he always answered: &quot;He was my emperor&quot;.

==Marriage and daughters==

In 1892, he married a wealthy noble of Russian-Serbian heritage, Anastasia Arapova (1872–1936). They had two daughters, Anastasie &quot;Stasie&quot; (1893–1978) and Sofia &quot;Sophy&quot; (1895–1963). The couple separated in 1902 and divorced in 1919.

==Political career==

===The White General and the Regent of Finland===


In December 1917, Finland declared independence from Soviet Russia which was ruled by the Bolsheviks after they overthrew the Provisional Government in the October Revolution. The Soviets accepted the secession for a variety of reasons, mostly because they could not control Finland; also, they hoped they could inspire a communist revolution there modeled after the Russian one. The Finnish parliament appointed P. E. Svinhufvud to lead the newly independent grand duchy&#x27;s interregnum government. In January 1918, a military committee was charged with bolstering the Finnish army, then not much more than some locally organised White Guards. Mannerheim was appointed to the committee, but soon resigned to protest its indecision. On 13 January, he was given command of the army. He had only 24,000 newly enlisted, mostly untrained men. The Finnish Red Guard, led by communist leader Kullervo Manner and backed by Soviet Russia, had 30,000 men; and there were 70,000 Red Russian troops in Finland. Mannerheim&#x27;s army was financed by a fifteen million mark line of credit provided by the bankers. His raw recruits had few arms. Nonetheless, he marched them to Vaasa, which was garrisoned by 42,500 Red Russians. He surrounded the Russian garrison with a mass of men; the defenders could not see that only the front rank was armed, so they surrendered, providing badly needed arms. Further weapons were purchased from Germany. Eighty-four Swedish officers and 200 Swedish NCOs served in the Finnish Civil War (or War of Liberty, as it was known among the &quot;Whites&quot;). Other officers were Finns who had been trained by the Germans as a Jäger Battalion. In March 1918 they were aided by German troops landing in Finland and occupying Helsinki.
After the Whites&#x27; victory in the bitterly fought civil war, during which both sides employed ruthless terror tactics, Mannerheim resigned as commander-in-chief. He left Finland in June 1918 to visit relatives in Sweden. In Stockholm, Mannerheim conferred with Allied diplomats, emphasizing his opposition to the Finnish government&#x27;s policy; Finnish leaders were confident the Germans would win the war, and had declared the Kaiser&#x27;s brother-in-law, Frederick Charles of Hesse, to be the King of Finland. In the meantime Svinhufvud served as the first Regent of the nascent kingdom. Mannerheim&#x27;s rapport with the Allies was recognized in October 1918 when the Finnish government sent him to Britain and France to attempt to gain Britain&#x27;s and the United States&#x27;s recognition of Finland&#x27;s independence. In December, he was summoned back to Finland; Frederick Charles had renounced the throne, and in his stead, Mannerheim had been elected Regent. As Regent, Mannerheim often signed official documents using &quot;Kustaa&quot;, the Finnish form of his Christian name, to emphasize his Finnishness to those who were suspicious of his background in the Russian armed forces and his difficulties with the Finnish language. Mannerheim disliked his last Christian name, Emil, and wrote his signature as C. G. Mannerheim, or simply Mannerheim. Among his relatives and close friends Mannerheim was called Gustaf.
Mannerheim secured recognition of Finnish independence from Britain and the United States. In July 1919, after he had confirmed a new, republican constitution, Mannerheim stood as a candidate in the first presidential election, with parliament as the electors. He was supported by the National Coalition Party and the Swedish People&#x27;s Party. He finished second to Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg, and withdrew from public life.

====Language skills====
Mannerheim&#x27;s mother tongue was Swedish. He spoke fluent German, French, and Russian, the last of which he learned in the forces of the Russian Imperial Army. He also spoke some English, Polish, Portuguese, Latin, and Chinese. He did not start learning Finnish properly until after Finland&#x27;s independence.

===Interwar period===

In the interwar years, Mannerheim held no public office, mainly because he was viewed by many politicians of the centre and left as a controversial figure for his ruthless battle with the Bolsheviks, his supposed desire for Finnish intervention on the side of the Whites during the Russian Civil War, and the Finnish socialists&#x27; antipathy toward him. They saw him as the bourgeois &quot;White General&quot;. Mannerheim doubted that modern party-based politics would produce principled and high-quality leaders in Finland or elsewhere. In his gloomy opinion, the fatherland&#x27;s interests were too often sacrificed by the democratic politicians for partisan benefit.

He kept busy heading the Finnish Red Cross (Chairman 1919–1951), was a member of the board of the International Red Cross, and founded the Mannerheim League for Child Welfare (&quot;Mannerheimin Lastensuojeluliitto&quot;). He was also the chairman of the supervisory board of a commercial bank, the Liittopankki-Unionsbanken, and after its merger with the Bank of Helsinki, the chairman of the supervisory board of that bank until 1934, and was a member of the board of Nokia Corporation. He offered to serve the French Foreign Legion in the Rif War (1925–1926), but was turned down.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Mannerheim returned to Asia, where he travelled and hunted extensively. On his first trip in 1927, to avoid going through the Soviet Union, he travelled through the British Empire, going by ship from London to Bombay. From there he travelled to Lucknow, Delhi, and Calcutta in the British India. From there he travelled overland to Burma, where he spent a month at Rangoon and Mandalay. He then went on to Sikkim and returned to Finland by car and aeroplane.

In his second voyage, in 1936, he went by ship from Aden (a British territory in Southern Arabia) to Bombay. During his travels and hunting expeditions, he visited Madras, Delhi and Nepal, where he was invited by the Rana Prime Minister Tin Maharaja Sir Joodha Shumser Jung Bahadur Rana to join a tiger hunt. In the same year, Mannerheim made a private visit to the United Kingdom, where he was accompanied for the first time by security guards, who Prime Minister Winston Churchill himself had given Mannerheim to use during the trip. However, Mannerheim is known to have been bothered by the presence of security guards, because mainly as a fatalist, he firmly believed in fate, if it had to happen in the form of an untimely death, and in addition, he also strongly trusted his own authority.

In 1936, Mannerheim represented the Finnish government at the funeral of King George V of the United Kingdom.

In 1929, Mannerheim refused the right-wing radicals&#x27; plea to become a &quot;de facto&quot; military dictator, although he did express some support for the right-wing Lapua Movement. After President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was elected in 1931, he appointed Mannerheim as chairman of Finland&#x27;s Defence Council and gave him a written promise that in the event of war he would become the Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army. (Svinhufvud&#x27;s successor Kyösti Kallio renewed this promise in 1937). In 1933, Mannerheim received the rank of Field Marshal (&quot;sotamarsalkka&quot;, &quot;fältmarskalk&quot;). By this time, Mannerheim had come to be seen by the public, including some former socialists, less as a &quot;White General&quot; and more as a nonpartisan figure, enhanced by his public statements urging reconciliation between the opposing sides in the Civil War and the need to focus on national unity and defence: &quot;we need not ask where a man stood fifteen years ago&quot;. Mannerheim supported Finland&#x27;s military industry and sought in vain to obtain a military defence union with Sweden. However, rearming the Finnish army did not occur as swiftly or as well as he hoped, and he was not enthusiastic about a war. He had many disagreements with various Cabinets, and signed many letters of resignation.

====1920 assassination attempt====
After their defeat in the Civil War, some Reds Guards attempted to assassinate Mannerheim. One of the would-be assassins, Eino Rahja, was in charge of the Saint Petersburg International School of Red Officers. He began planning an assassination by assembling eight groups of Finnish Red Guards in Saint Petersburg for this purpose. The attempt happened in April 1920 during a White Guard&#x27;s parade on Hämeenkatu in Tampere, in which General Mannerheim was to participate.

The group gathered on 3 April at the Park Café in Hämeenkatu; and at this stage, group member Karl Salo was designated as a shooter and given a Colt pistol. However, the assassination attempt failed due to Salo&#x27;s hesitation. Salo&#x27;s security detail in the crowd, consisting of Aleksander Weckman and Aleksanteri Suokas, who had been equipped with Walther and Colt pistols, lost sight of Salo and never had time to shoot Mannerheim either.

On 6 April Weckman, the operation leader, threatened to kill Salo if he had not assassinated either Mannerheim or the Minister of War and Uusimaa County Governor within a week. Bruno Jalander. This attempt was also unsuccessful, as Mannerheim and Jalander did not come to the Helsinki Conservation Party celebration after the authorities received a tip. Salo returned his pistol and escaped afterwards. Weckman and Suokas tried to escape to the Soviet Union with their two assistants but were arrested on the Helsinki-Vyborg train the night of 21 April. Salo was arrested in Espoo on 23 April.

===Commander-in-Chief===

As chairman of the Finnish Defence Council, Mannerheim opposed war with the Soviet Union from the beginning. When the Soviets requested that Finland cede territory, he recommended that the Finnish government give into these demands, arguing that the Finnish Army was not strong enough to repel a Soviet attack. When negotiations with the Soviet Union failed in 1939, and aware of the imminent war and deploring the lack of equipment and preparation of the army, Mannerheim resigned from the military council on 17 October 1939, declaring that he would agree to return to business only as Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army. He officially became the supreme commander of the armies, at the age of 72, after the Soviet attack on 30 November 1939. In a letter to his daughter Sophie, he stated, &quot;I had not wanted to undertake the responsibility of commander-in-chief, as my age and my health entitled me, but I had to yield to appeals from the President of the Republic and the government, and now for the fourth time I am at war.&quot;

He addressed the first of his often controversial orders of the day to the Defence Forces on the day the war began:

 The defensive field fortifications they manned became known as the Mannerheim Line.

Field Marshal Mannerheim quickly organised his headquarters in Mikkeli. His chief of staff was Lieutenant General Aksel Airo, while his close friend, General Rudolf Walden, was sent as a representative of the headquarters to the cabinet from 3 December 1939 until 27 March 1940, after which he became defence minister.

Mannerheim spent most of the Winter War and Continuation War in his Mikkeli headquarters but made many visits to the front. Between the wars, he remained commander-in-chief. Although Mannerheim&#x27;s main task was to lead the war, he also knew how to strengthen and maintain the will of the soldiers to fight. He was famed for this quote:

Mannerheim kept relations with Adolf Hitler&#x27;s government as formal as possible. Mannerheim did not really appreciate Hitler, even though he initially expressed an interest in his rise to power; his attitude towards Hitler turned negative at the point when Mannerheim&#x27;s visit to Germany made him realize what kind of &quot;ideal state&quot; Hitler was building; he compared Hitler&#x27;s rise in Germany to the 1917 rise of the Bolshevists in Russia. Before the Continuation War, the Germans offered Mannerheim command over 80,000 German troops in Finland. Mannerheim declined so as to not tie himself and Finland to Nazi war aims; Mannerheim was ready for cooperation and fraternity with Hitler&#x27;s Germany, but for practical rather than ideological reasons because of the Soviet threat. In July 1941 the Finnish Army of Karelia was strengthened by the German 163rd Infantry Division. They retook the Finnish territories annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War, and went further, occupying East Karelia. Finnish troops took part in the Siege of Leningrad, which lasted 872 days.

Soviet leader Joseph Stalin pressured Churchill to declare war against Finland, a decision that was particularly difficult for Churchill due to his acquaintance with Mannerheim. Churchill delayed the declaration and sent a personal note to Mannerheim, in which he recalled their past encounters and warned Mannerheim about the impending declaration. Mannerheim thanked Churchill for his thoughtfulness and responded that his mission was to ensure Finland&#x27;s security.

On 20 June 1942, Mannerheim was inspecting Finnish front line troops in Poventsa when he and his staff were engaged by a Soviet anti-tank gun with direct fire. One shell exploded near Mannerheim who, on varying accounts, took cover either in a trench or behind tree trunks until Finnish counter-battery fire neutralized the attacker. Captain Ahti Petramaa, section commander during the inspection, lost fingers from flying shrapnel and was escorted to an aid station where he was promoted to major by Mannerheim.

===Visit by Adolf Hitler===
Mannerheim&#x27;s 75th birthday, 4 June 1942, was a national celebration. The government granted him the unique title of Marshal of Finland (&quot;Suomen Marsalkka&quot; in Finnish, &quot;Marskalk av Finland&quot; in Swedish). So far he is the only person to receive the title. A surprise birthday visit by Hitler occurred on the day as he wished to visit the &quot;brave Finns (&quot;die tapferen Finnen&quot;)&quot; and their leader Mannerheim. Mannerheim did not want to meet him at his headquarters or in Helsinki, as then it would seem like an official state visit. The meeting took place near Imatra, in south-eastern Finland, and was arranged in secrecy. From Immola Airfield, Hitler, accompanied by President Ryti, was driven to where Baron Mannerheim was waiting at a railway siding. A speech from Hitler was followed by a birthday meal and negotiations between him and Mannerheim. Overall, Hitler spent about five hours in Finland; he reportedly asked the Finns to step up military operations against the Soviets, but apparently made no specific demands.

During the visit, an engineer of the Finnish broadcasting company Yleisradio, Thor Damen, succeeded in recording the first eleven minutes of Hitler&#x27;s and Mannerheim&#x27;s private conversation. This had to be done secretly, as Hitler never allowed off-guard recordings. Damen was assigned to record the official birthday speeches and Mannerheim&#x27;s response and therefore placed microphones in some of the railway cars. However, Mannerheim and his guests chose to go to a car that did not have a microphone in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the car windows onto a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler&#x27;s and Mannerheim&#x27;s private conversation, Hitler&#x27;s SS bodyguards spotted the cords coming out of the window and realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They gestured to him to stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be destroyed, but Yleisradio was allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to Kustaa Vilkuna, head of the state censors&#x27; office, and in 1957 returned to Yleisradio. It was released to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler speaking outside of a formal occasion.

There is an unsubstantiated story that while conversing with Hitler, Mannerheim lit a cigar. Mannerheim expected that Hitler would ask Finland for more help against the Soviet Union, which Mannerheim was unwilling to give. When Mannerheim lit up, all in attendance gasped, for Hitler&#x27;s aversion to smoking was well known. Nevertheless, Hitler continued the conversation calmly, with no comment. By this test, Mannerheim could judge if Hitler was speaking from a position of strength or weakness. He refused Hitler, knowing that Hitler was in a weak position, and could not dictate to him.

Shortly thereafter, Mannerheim returned the visit, traveling to Hitler&#x27;s headquarters in East Prussia.

===End of war and presidency===

In June 1944, Baron Gustaf Mannerheim, to ensure German support while a major Soviet offensive was threatening Finland, thought that it was necessary to agree to the pact the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop demanded. But even then Mannerheim distanced himself from the pact, and it fell to President Risto Ryti to sign it, so it came to be known as the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement. This allowed Mannerheim to revoke the agreement upon the resignation of President Ryti at the start of August 1944. Mannerheim succeeded Ryti as president.

When Germany was deemed sufficiently weakened, and the USSR&#x27;s summer offensive was fought to a standstill (see Battle of Tali-Ihantala) thanks to the June agreement with the Germans, Finland&#x27;s leaders saw a chance to reach a peace with the Soviet Union. At first, attempts were made to persuade Mannerheim to become prime minister, but he rejected them because of his age and lack of experience running a civil government. The next suggestion was to elect him head of state. Risto Ryti would resign as president, and parliament would appoint Mannerheim as regent. The use of the title &quot;regent&quot; would have reflected the exceptional circumstances of Mannerheim&#x27;s election. Mannerheim and Ryti both agreed, and Ryti submitted a notice of resignation on 1 August. The Parliament of Finland passed a special act conferring the presidency on Mannerheim on 4 August 1944. He took the oath of office the same day.
A month after Mannerheim took office, the Continuation War was concluded on harsh terms, but ultimately far less harsh than those imposed on the other states bordering the Soviet Union. Finland retained its sovereignty, its parliamentary democracy, and its market economy. Territorial losses were considerable; a portion of Karelia and all Petsamo were lost. Numerous Karelian refugees needed to be relocated. The war reparations were very heavy. Finland also had to fight the Lapland War against withdrawing German troops in the north, and at the same time demobilize its own army, making it harder to expel the Germans; Mannerheim appointed Lieutenant General Hjalmar Siilasvuo as the high commander of the army to take this action. It is widely agreed that only Mannerheim could have guided Finland through these difficult times, when the Finnish people had to come to terms with the severe conditions of the armistice, their implementation by a Soviet-dominated Allied Control Commission, and the task of post-war reconstruction.

Before deciding to accept the Soviet demands, Mannerheim wrote a missive directly to Hitler:

Mannerheim&#x27;s term as president was difficult for him. Although he was elected for a full six-year term, he was 77 years old in 1944 and had accepted the office reluctantly after being urged to do so. The situation was exacerbated by frequent periods of ill-health, the demands of the Allied Control Commission, and the war responsibility trials. He was afraid throughout most of his presidency that the commission would request his prosecution for crimes against peace. This never happened. One of the reasons for this was Stalin&#x27;s respect for and admiration of the Marshal. Stalin told a Finnish delegation in Moscow in 1947 that the Finns owed much to their old Marshal. Due to Mannerheim, Finland was not occupied. Despite Mannerheim&#x27;s criticisms of some of the demands of the Control Commission, he worked hard to carry out Finland&#x27;s armistice obligations. He also emphasised the necessity of further work on reconstruction in Finland after the war.

Mannerheim was troubled by recurring health problems during 1945, and was absent on medical leave from his duties as president from November until February 1946. He spent six weeks in Portugal to restore his health. After the announcement of the verdicts in the war crimes trials in February, Mannerheim decided to resign. He believed that he had accomplished the duties he had been elected to carry out: The war was ended, the armistice obligations carried out, and war responsibility trials finished.

Mannerheim resigned as president on 4 March 1946, giving as his reason his declining health and his view that the tasks he had been selected to carry out had been accomplished. He was succeeded as president by the conservative Prime Minister J. K. Paasikivi.

==Final days and death==

After his resignation, Marshal Baron Mannerheim bought Kirkniemi Manor in Lohja, intending to spend his retirement there. In June 1946, he underwent an operation for a perforated peptic ulcer, and in October of that year he was diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer. In early 1947, it was recommended that he should travel to the Valmont Sanatorium in Montreux, Switzerland, to recuperate and write his memoirs. Valmont was to be Mannerheim&#x27;s main residence for the remainder of his life, although he regularly returned to Finland, and also visited Sweden, France and Italy.

Because Mannerheim was old and sickly, he personally wrote only certain passages of his memoirs. He dictated some other parts. The remaining parts were written from his recollections by Mannerheim&#x27;s various assistants, such as Colonel Aladár Paasonen; General Erik Heinrichs; Generals Grandell, Olenius and Martola; and Colonel Viljanen, a war historian. As long as Mannerheim was able to read, he proofread the typewritten drafts of his memoirs. He was almost totally silent about his private life, and focused instead on Finland&#x27;s history, especially between 1917 and 1944. When Mannerheim suffered a fatal bowel obstruction in January 1951, his memoirs were not yet in their finished form. They were published after his death.

Mannerheim died on 27 January 1951 (28 January Finnish time), in the Cantonal Hospital in Lausanne (; modern Lausanne University Hospital), Switzerland. He was buried on 4 February 1951 in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki in a state funeral with full military honours.

==Legacy==

Today, Mannerheim retains respect as Finland&#x27;s greatest . This may be partly due to his refusal to enter partisan politics (although his sympathies were more right-wing than left-wing), his claim always to serve the fatherland without selfish motives, his personal courage in visiting the front lines, his ability to work diligently into his late seventies, and his foreign political farsightedness in preparing for the Soviet invasion of Finland years before it occurred. Although Finland fought alongside Nazi Germany during the Continuation War and thus in co-operation with the Axis Powers, a number of leaders of the Allies still respected Mannerheim. These included, among others, the then British Prime Minister Winston Churchill; at a 2017 conference in London, war historian Terry Charman said it was difficult for Churchill to declare war on Finland at Stalin&#x27;s demand due to his previous uncomplicated co-operation with Mannerheim, which led Churchill and Mannerheim to exchange polite and apologetic correspondence about the prevailing circumstance, with deep respect for each other.

Mannerheim&#x27;s birthday, 4 June, is celebrated as Flag Day by the Finnish Defence Forces. This decision was made by the Finnish government on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 1942, when he was also granted the title of Marshal of Finland. Flag Day is celebrated with a national parade, and rewards and promotions for members of the defence forces. The life and times of Mannerheim are memorialised in the Mannerheim Museum. The most prominent boulevard in the Finnish capital was renamed Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Road) already in the Marshal&#x27;s honour during his lifetime; along the road, at the Kamppi district, stands Hotel Marski, which is named after him. Mannerheim&#x27;s former hunting lodge and resting place known as the &quot;Marshal&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (&quot;Marskin Maja&quot;), which now serves as both a museum and a restaurant, is located at the shores of Lake Punelia in Loppi, Finland.

Various landmarks across Finland honour Mannerheim, including most famously the Equestrian statue located on Helsinki&#x27;s Mannerheimintie in front of the later-built Kiasma museum of modern art. Mannerheim Parks in both Turku and Seinäjoki include statues of him. Tampere&#x27;s Mannerheim statue depicting the victorious Civil War general of the Whites was eventually placed in the forest some kilometres outside the city (in part due to lingering controversy over Mannerheim&#x27;s Civil War role). Other statues, for examples, were erected in Mikkeli and Lahti. On 5 December 2004, Mannerheim was voted the greatest Finnish person of all time in the Suuret suomalaiset (Great Finns) contest.

From 1937 to 1967, at least five different Finnish postage stamps or stamp series were issued in honour of Mannerheim; and in 1960 the United States honoured Mannerheim as the &quot;Liberator of Finland&quot; with regular first-class domestic and international stamps (at the time four cents and eight cents respectively) as part of its Champions of Liberty series that included other notable figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and Simon Bolivar.

Mannerheim appears as a main character in Ilmari Turja&#x27;s 1966 play and its the 1970 film adaptation &quot;The Headquarters&quot;, directed by Matti Kassila. In both the play and the film, Mannerheim was played by Joel Rinne. Mannerheim was also played by Asko Sarkola in the 2001 television film &quot;Valtapeliä elokuussa 1940&quot;, directed by Veli-Matti Saikkonen.

<text>Mauno Henrik Koivisto (, 25 November 1923 – 12 May 2017) was a Finnish politician who served as the ninth president of Finland from 1982 to 1994. He also served as the country&#x27;s prime minister twice, from 1968 to 1970 and again from 1979 to 1982. He was also the first member of the Social Democratic Party to be elected as President of Finland.

==Early life==

Koivisto was born in Turku as the second son of Juho Koivisto, a carpenter at Crichton-Vulcan shipyard, and Hymni Sofia Eskola, who died when he was 10. After attending primary school, Koivisto worked a number of jobs, and at the beginning of the Winter War in 1939 joined a field firefighting unit at the age of 16. During the Continuation War, Koivisto served in the Infantry Detachment Törni led by Lauri Törni, which was a reconnaissance detachment operating behind enemy lines. This detachment was only open to selected volunteers. During the war, he received the Order of the Cross of Liberty (2nd class) and was promoted to the rank of corporal. While reflecting on his wartime experiences later in life, he said &quot;&quot;When you have taken part in a game in which your own life is at stake, all other games are small after that&quot;.&quot;

After the war, he earned a living as a carpenter and became active in politics, joining the Social Democratic Party. During his early years, Koivisto was also influenced by anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism. In 1948, he found work at the port of Turku. In December 1948, he was appointed the manager of the Harbour Labour Office of Turku, a post he held until 1951. In 1949, communist-controlled trade unions attempted to topple Karl-August Fagerholm&#x27;s social democratic minority government, and the Social Democratic leadership of the Finnish Confederation of Trade Unions (SAK) declared the port of Hanko an &quot;open site&quot;, urging port workers who supported legality to go there. Koivisto went to Hanko to take charge of the harbour-master&#x27;s office and recruit workers to break the strike, the government having banned strike action. The Communist newspapers branded Koivisto as their number one enemy due to his status as a major figure in the struggle for control of the trade unions.

==Career==

In addition to his political engagements and ongoing career, Koivisto continued with his education, passing his intermediate examination in 1947 and his university entrance examination in 1949. In 1951, he became a primary school teacher. On 22 June 1952, he married Tellervo Kankaanranta. Together they had a daughter, Assi Koivisto, who was later voted to the electoral college during the 1982 presidential election. Koivisto graduated from the University of Turku with a Master of Arts degree and a licentiate in 1953, and had plans to become a sociologist. Three years later he completed his doctoral thesis, which examined social relations in the Turku dockyards. Koivisto also served as Vocational Counselor for the City of Turku, and as a member of the Turku City Council.

In 1957, he started working for the Helsinki Workers&#x27; Savings Bank and served as its general manager from 1959 to 1968. In 1968, he was appointed as the chairman of the board at the Bank of Finland, a position he held until 1982. During the 1960s, he witnessed a number of internal schisms within the Social Democratic Party, and made efforts to improve the party&#x27;s relationships with both the communists and with President Urho Kekkonen.
==Political career==

The 1966 parliamentary election&#x27;s Social Democratic victory saw the formation of a government under Prime Minister Rafael Paasio, with Koivisto, the party&#x27;s expert on economic policy, assuming the role of the Minister of Finance. By the beginning of 1968, many SDP members had become disillusioned with Paasio&#x27;s leadership style, and Koivisto emerged as the chief candidate to succeed Paasio as prime minister. Koivisto became the prime minister of his first government, the Koivisto I Cabinet, on 22 March 1968. He served as prime minister for two years until the 1970 parliamentary election, which saw the other parties in the coalition government—Centre, SKDL, SPP, and TPSL—suffer heavy losses, bringing about Koivisto&#x27;s resignation.

In the 1970s, President Kekkonen started to regard Koivisto as a potential rival. To counter this, he threw his weight behind Koivisto&#x27;s Social Democratic colleague, Kalevi Sorsa. For most of the decade, Koivisto concentrated on his work as the chairman of the Bank of Finland. The 1979 election saw him return as prime minister, forming a coalition government between the SDP, Centre, SPP, and SKDL. By this point there was increasing dissatisfaction with the aging President Kekkonen, whose failing health was becoming difficult to conceal, and also a perceived lack of change. As prime minister and chairman of the Bank of Finland who enjoyed high ratings in opinion polls, Koivisto began to be seen as a likely future candidate for the presidency.

In early 1981, President Kekkonen began to regret Koivisto&#x27;s appointment as prime minister and started to offer support to those who wanted to get rid of him. In the spring of 1981, members of Centre, which was serving as part of the government coalition, launched a behind-the-scenes attempt to bring down the government through a parliamentary motion of no confidence, so that Koivisto would not be able to conduct a presidential election campaign from the position of Prime Minister. At the critical moment Koivisto managed to gain the support of the SKDL. He was thus able to call Kekkonen&#x27;s bluff by refusing to tender his resignation, reminding Kekkonen that the prime minister and Cabinet were responsible to Parliament, not the president. This would have been unthinkable for most of Kekkonen&#x27;s quarter-century in office, but by then Kekkonen no longer had the energy to topple the government.

Finnish historians, political scientists, and journalists still debate whether Kekkonen really wanted to dismiss Koivisto or whether Kekkonen simply wanted to speed up Koivisto&#x27;s slow and ponderous decision-making. Some question whether this government crisis was just a part of the ruthless &quot;presidential game&quot; that top politicians such as Koivisto and Social Democratic chairman Sorsa were playing with one another. By October 1981, it became apparent that Kekkonen was too ill to carry out his duties, and he announced he would not run again. He resigned soon afterward, making Koivisto acting president. Koivisto was able to launch his presidential election campaign from the position.

During the campaign, Koivisto was questioned particularly thoroughly on two issues: the nature of his socialism and his relations to the Soviet Union. Describing the nature of his socialism, he referred to Eduard Bernstein, a revisionist social democrat, saying: &quot;The important thing is the movement, not the goal.&quot; To a journalist&#x27;s question, intended to be a difficult one, on the issue of relations with the Soviet Union, Koivisto replied that they were nothing to boast about; this answer increased his popularity. Koivisto did not want to be elected with the support of the Soviet Union.

The voter turnout in the presidential elections was nearly 90%. Koivisto&#x27;s wife and daughter were among the members of the electoral college. Koivisto won 167 of the 301 votes of the electoral college in the first round; his closest competitor, NCP candidate Harri Holkeri, received 58. As a result, Koivisto became Finland&#x27;s first socialist president. His victory completed a long process of integrating the Social Democrats into Finland&#x27;s political life, dating back to the Civil War.

==Presidency (1982–1994)==

As president, Koivisto kept a low profile and used less authoritarian leadership tactics than Kekkonen had employed, refraining from using some of his presidential powers and initiating a new era of parliamentarianism in Finland. On the other hand, he had an occasionally difficult relationship with journalists, which he famously called &quot;lemmings&quot;. One practical problem that quite a few reporters had with Koivisto&#x27;s statements was their deeply pondering and philosophical nature.

Mauno Koivisto&#x27;s presidency (1982–1994) marked a deliberate shift from the strong presidential dominance of his predecessor, Urho Kekkonen, towards a more parliament-centered governance. He consciously limited the exercise of presidential powers, fostering an environment where the Prime Minister and Parliament assumed greater responsibility in decision-making processes.

Koivisto also supported constitutional reforms aimed at reducing presidential authority, thereby strengthening Finland&#x27;s parliamentary system. This transition contributed to a more balanced distribution of power within the Finnish government, aligning with his commitment to democratic principles.

Those statements were not often easy to interpret, unlike Kekkonen&#x27;s blunt and sometimes harsh statements. As the leader of Finland&#x27;s foreign policies he initially continued Kekkonen&#x27;s line until the collapse of the Soviet Union. He also continued the established practice of returning Soviet defectors to the Soviet Union, a custom now prohibited as a human rights violation by the Finnish constitution.

Koivisto created close contacts with Mikhail Gorbachev, George H. W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. He carried on private correspondence with Gorbachev and Bush. His ties to the other Nordic countries and Nordic colleagues were very close and trustworthy. He spoke fluent Russian, Swedish, English, and German.

In the critical moments during which the Soviet Union was collapsing, and the Baltic countries, particularly Estonia, were declaring themselves independent, Koivisto referred to the policy of neutrality and avoided publicly supporting the Baltic independence movement, but its members were allowed to work from Finland. Koivisto&#x27;s Finland recognized the new Estonian government only after the major powers had done so. Koivisto did however covertly send money to Estonia to assist their independence movement.

Koivisto made two bold unilateral diplomatic moves that significantly changed the Finnish political position. In 1990, after the reunification of Germany, Koivisto unilaterally renounced the terms of the Paris Peace Treaties which limited the strength and armament of the Finnish Defence Forces. The rationale was that after Germany had been given its full rights as a sovereign state, Finland could not remain bound by the antiquated treaty. The renunciation caused no official protest from Soviet Union or Great Britain. The other major move was the renunciation of the Finno-Soviet Treaty () in 1991, concurrently with the fall of Soviet Union. The treaty, the military article of which had shaped Finnish foreign policy for decades, was substituted with a new treaty without military obligations in the next year.


In 1990, partly motivated by nationalism, partly by the fear of the declining work force, Koivisto proposed that any Soviet citizen with either Finnish or Ingrian ancestry be enabled to immigrate to Finland as a returnee. The proposal resulted in a modification of immigration laws to this end during the year.

After the Soviet Union collapsed, Koivisto was against returning Karelian old Finnish parts back to Finland.

In the 1988 presidential election, Koivisto was re-elected with 189 out of 301 votes in the electoral college during the second round. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he supported more radical ideals like joining the European Union. In 1992, Koivisto initiated the process of Finnish accession to the European community. The final terms of the membership agreement were finalised on the day of Koivisto&#x27;s departure from the presidency. He was succeeded by President Martti Ahtisaari, who was also a supporter of EU membership.

Koivisto&#x27;s popularity sharply declined during Finland&#x27;s economic depression of the early 1990s, because many unemployed or otherwise impoverished citizens believed that he could have forced the centre-right government of Esko Aho to stimulate the economy and grant unemployed people temporary public sector jobs.

Koivisto&#x27;s term ended in 1994. Henceforth he published his memoirs in four volumes and continued as a commentator on economics and both domestic and international politics.

==Post-presidency==

Subsequent to his presidency, Koivisto occasionally continued to represent Finland officially abroad, most notably at the funerals of Queen Ingrid of Denmark in 2000, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002 and Ronald Reagan in 2004.

In 2009, Koivisto declined to apologize to Estonia that his administration did not support the country&#x27;s independence movement.

On 3 March 2010, he was hospitalized for cardiac dysrhythmia but was released less than a week later.

===Hobby===
Volleyball was Koivisto&#x27;s long-standing hobby, the volleyball hobby began when he was in his twenties and continued until retirement.

===Death===
Koivisto&#x27;s health deteriorated in December 2016 due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and his wife Tellervo started as his caregiver. In January 2017, Koivisto fell badly at his home and broke his hand, after which he moved to a nursing home. In May 2017, Koivisto was put in end-of-life care. Koivisto died on 12 May 2017, aged 93.

His state funeral was held on 25 May 2017. Koivisto is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.
