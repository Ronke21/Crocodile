<text>Janez Drnovšek (; 17 May 1950 – 23 February 2008) was a Slovenian liberal politician, President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia (1989–1990), Prime Minister of Slovenia (1992–2002, with a short break in 2000) and President of Slovenia (2002–2007).

==Youth and early career==

Drnovšek was born in Celje and was raised in the small town of Kisovec in the Municipality of Zagorje ob Savi, where his father Viktor (1923–2006) was the local mine chief and his mother Silva (1921–1978) was a homemaker. Drnovšek graduated from the University of Ljubljana with a degree in economics in 1973.

Meanwhile, he worked as an intern at a Le Havre bank. In 1975, at the age of 25, he became chief financial officer at SGP Beton Zagorje, a construction company. Two years later he became, for one year, an economic adviser at the Yugoslav embassy in Cairo.

He defended his master&#x27;s thesis in 1981 and in 1986 he defended his dissertation at the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Maribor. In 1983, he became head of the local branch of Ljubljana Bank in his home region of the Central Sava Valley in central Slovenia. In 1986 he was chosen to be a delegate at the Slovenian Republic Assembly (parliament) and also the Chamber of Republics and Provinces of the Yugoslav parliament.

==Membership in the Yugoslav presidency==

In 1989, Stane Dolanc, the Slovenian representative to the collective presidency of Yugoslavia, retired. The League of Communists of Slovenia, aware of upcoming democratisation, decided to organize elections between two candidates for the position. Drnovšek, until then rather unknown to the public, defeated Marko Bulc, the Party&#x27;s preferred candidate.

The Communist leaderships of other Yugoslav republics did not agree with this new way of selecting the representative to the Collective Presidency, so the Slovenian Republic Parliament had to confirm the result of the elections. Drnovšek served as chairman of the Collective Presidency from 1989–90. While he was chairman of the presidency, he was also chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement and the commander of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army. In the capacity of the chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement Drnovšek notably opened the 9th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade with the speech in Slovenian language.

Until the end of communist rule he was an active member of the Communist Party. After the democratic changes in Slovenia, the country seceded from Yugoslavia. Following the Ten Day War, Drnovšek used his position in the collective presidency to help mediate the Brioni Agreement and to negotiate a peaceful withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Slovenia.

==Prime Minister of Slovenia==

In 1992, after a Government crisis in the DEMOS coalition, which had won the first democratic elections in Slovenia in 1990 and led the country to independence, Drnovšek became the second Prime Minister of independent Slovenia. He was chosen as a compromise candidate and an expert in economic policy.

His bi-partisan government was supported both by the left and centrist wing of the dissolved DEMOS coalition (the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia, the Democratic Party and the Greens of Slovenia) and by three parties that derived from organizations of the former Communist regime (the Liberal Democratic Party, the Party of Democratic Reform and the Socialist Party of Slovenia).

Shortly afterwards, Drnovšek was elected president of the Liberal Democratic Party (&quot;Liberalno demokratska stranka&quot; – LDS), the legal successor of the Association of Socialist Youth of Slovenia (&quot;Zveza socialistične mladine Slovenije&quot; – ZSMS), the youth fraction of the Communist Party of Slovenia.

In 1992, the Liberal Democratic Party under Drnovšek&#x27;s leadership won the parliamentary elections, but due to a high fragmentation of the popular vote had to ally itself with other parties in order to form a stable government. Despite a politically turbulent mandate (in 1994, the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia left the coalition), the Party gained votes in 1996, remaining the largest party in the government.

Nevertheless, Drnovšek barely secured himself a third term in office after a failed attempt to ally himself with the Slovenian National Party. In 1997, the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia formed a coalition government with the populist Slovenian People&#x27;s Party which finally enabled Drnovšek to serve a third term in office.

He headed the government until May 2000, when he stepped down due to disagreements with the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party. After less than six months in opposition, Drnovšek returned to power in the autumn of 2000, after his party gained a clear victory in the parliamentary elections.

Drnovšek&#x27;s governments guided Slovenia&#x27;s political and economic reconstruction. He successfully tackled the twin tasks of reorienting Slovenia&#x27;s trade away from the wreckage of the old Yugoslavia towards the West and replacing the ineffective Communist-era business model with more market-based mechanisms.

Unlike the other five former Yugoslav republics which were run for much of the 1990s by frequently authoritarian presidents, Slovenia under Drnovšek&#x27;s premiership quickly emerged from the break-up of the federation as a functioning parliamentary democracy. Drnovšek&#x27;s political strategy was concentrated on broad coalitions, transcending ideological and programmatic divisions between parties.
Contrary to some other former Communist countries in Eastern Europe, the economic and social transformation in Slovenia pursued by Drnovšek&#x27;s governments followed a gradualist approach.

Drnovšek was a staunch supporter of Slovenia&#x27;s entry in the European Union and NATO and was largely responsible for Slovenia&#x27;s successful bid for membership in both of those organizations. As Prime minister, he was frequently active on foreign policy issues. On 16 June 2001, he helped to arrange the first meeting of the U.S. President George W. Bush with the Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was held in the Upper Carniolan estate of Brdo pri Kranju. (Bush-Putin 2001) In 2002, he ran for President of Slovenia, and was elected in the second round, defeating the center-right candidate Barbara Brezigar.

==President of Slovenia and the change in lifestyle==
Drnovšek&#x27;s presidency was highly controversial. In the first three years in office, he rarely appeared in public, save for the most important official duties. In 2006, however, a change of style became visible. He launched several campaigns in foreign policy, such as a failed humanitarian mission to Darfur and a proposal for the solution of the political crisis in Kosovo. On January 30, 2006, he left the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. Shortly afterwards, he founded the Movement for Justice and Development and became its first president. He claimed this was not meant to be a political movement, but rather a wide initiative, aiming to &quot;raise human consciousness and make the world a better place&quot;. On June 26, 2006, he announced that he would not be running for a second term in an interview on TV Slovenia.

=== Conflict with the Government ===

The 2004 legislative election brought further changes and a political swing to the right. Janez Janša, the leader of a right-wing coalition, formed the new government. In Slovenia, this was the first time after 1992 that the President and the Prime Minister had represented opposing political factions for more than a few months. Between 2002-04, the relationship between President Drnovšek and Janez Janša, then leader of the opposition, were considered more than good and in the first year of cohabitation, no major problems arose.

In the beginning of his term, Drnovšek, who was ill with kidney cancer, stayed out of public view. When he reemerged in late 2005 he had already changed his lifestyle: he had become a vegan (though one of his colleagues in a televised interview mentioned their regular Sunday visits to a pizzeria in Maxi market, Ljubljana), moved out of the capital into the countryside, and withdrew from party politics completely, ending his already frozen membership in the Liberal Democracy. Drnovšek&#x27;s new approach to politics prompted one political commentator to nickname him &quot;Slovenia&#x27;s Gandhi&quot;.

The relationship between Drnovšek and the government quickly became tense. Disagreements began with Drnovšek&#x27;s initiatives in foreign politics, aimed at solving major foreign conflicts, including those in Darfur and Kosovo. Initially, these initiatives were not openly opposed by the Prime Minister Janez Janša, but were criticized by the foreign minister Dimitrij Rupel, Drnovšek&#x27;s former collaborator and close political ally until 2004.

A major clash between the two happened in Summer 2006, when disagreement arose over Drnovšek&#x27;s attempt to intervene in the Darfur conflict. The disagreements moved from issues of domestic politics in October 2006, when Drnovšek publicly criticised the treatment of the Strojans, a Romani family whose neighborhood had forced them to relocate, which in turn had subjected them to police supervision and limitation of movement.

The disagreements however escalated when the parliamentary majority repeatedly rejected President&#x27;s candidates for the Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, beginning with the rejection of incumbent Mitja Gaspari. The friction continued over the appointment of other state official nominees, including Constitutional Court judges. Although the President&#x27;s political support suffered after his personal transformation, the polls nevertheless showed public backing of the President against an increasingly unpopular Government.
The tension reached its apex in May 2007, when the newly appointed director of the Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency Matjaž Šinkovec unclassified several documents from the period before 2004, revealing, among other, that Drnovšek had used secret service funds for personal purposes between 2002-04. The President reacted with a harsh criticism of the government&#x27;s policies, accusing the ruling coalition of abusing its power for personal delegitimations and labeled the then current Prime Minister Janez Janša as &quot;the leader of the negative guys&quot;

In the last months in office, Drnovšek continued his attacks on Prime Minister Janez Janša, who mostly remained silent on the issue. Drnovšek accused Janša of &quot;fostering proto-totalitarian tendencies&quot;. He became a blogger (Janez D), signing his posts as &quot;Janez D&quot; and expressing opinions on various issues from foreign policy, environmentalism, human relationships, religion, animal rights and personal growth. In his last months in office, he withdrew to a reclusive life again, devoting his time to the Movement for Justice and Development and the popularization of his lifestyle and views.

===Lifestyle changes===
During his time in office as the President of Slovenia, he wrote and published several books in spiritual philosophy, including &quot;Misli o življenju in zavedanju&quot; (&quot;Thoughts on Life and Consciousness&quot;), &quot;Zlate misli o življenju in zavedanju&quot; (&quot;Golden Thoughts on Life and Consciousness&quot;), &quot;Bistvo sveta&quot; (&quot;The Essence of the World&quot;), and his last one called &quot;Pogovori&quot; or Dialogues. According to his own accounts, it took him only two or three weeks to write each of his books, due to – in his words – &quot;the higher consciousness&quot; he was able to access.

His lifestyle was a mixture of elements from various traditions, including Hindu religious thought and the non-attachment of Buddhist philosophy. He also valued the indigenous traditions of the world. For example, he was present at the inauguration of Evo Morales, the first native American president of Bolivia, and later hosted Bolivian ethnic musicians in the Presidential Palace in Ljubljana. After his cancer diagnosis, Drnovšek became a vegan and claimed that this greatly improved his health.

Because of his new lifestyle and the content of his books and blogs, he was often regarded as an adherent of the New Age movement, although he rejected such a qualification as being too narrow.

==Personal life==
Drnovšek was fluent in six languages, namely his native Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, English, Spanish, French and German.
He was divorced with one son, Jaša, who is a translator and journalist.

In 2005, he found out about the existence of a daughter, Nana Forte, otherwise a renowned composer. His sister is Helena Drnovšek Zorko, who has been the Slovenian ambassador in Japan since September 2010.

===Death===

In 1999, Drnovšek had kidney cancer resulting in the removal of a kidney. In 2001, he had cancerous formations on his lungs and liver. He repeatedly claimed nature was the best cure, and spent most of his days at his home in Zaplana. He died there on February 23, 2008, aged 57, just two months after his presidential term ended. His body was cremated shortly afterwards. His remains were buried with honors in a private memorial service in his native Zagorje ob Savi, alongside his parents.

<text>In zoology, megafauna (from Greek μέγας &quot;megas&quot; &quot;large&quot; and Neo-Latin &quot;fauna&quot; &quot;animal life&quot;) are large animals. The precise definition of the term varies widely, though a common threshold is approximately , with other thresholds as low as or as high as . Large body size is generally associated with other traits, such as having a slow rate of reproduction and, in large herbivores, reduced or negligible adult mortality from being killed by predators.

Megafauna species have considerable effects on their local environment, including the suppression of the growth of woody vegetation and a consequent reduction in wildfire frequency. Megafauna also play a role in regulating and stabilizing the abundance of smaller animals.

During the Pleistocene, megafauna were diverse across the globe, with most continental ecosystems exhibiting similar or greater species richness in megafauna as compared to ecosystems in Africa today. During the Late Pleistocene, particularly from around 50,000 years ago onwards, most large mammal species became extinct, including 80% of all mammals greater than , while small animals were largely unaffected. This pronouncedly size-biased extinction is otherwise unprecedented in the geological record. Humans and climatic change have been implicated by most authors as the likely causes, though the relative importance of either factor has been the subject of significant controversy.

== History ==
One of the earliest occurrences of the term &quot;megafauna&quot; is Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s 1876 work &quot;The geographical distribution of animals&quot;. He described the animals as &quot;the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms&quot;. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the term usually refers to large animals. There are variations in thresholds used to define megafauna as a whole or certain groups of megafauna. Many scientific literature adopt Paul S. Martin&#x27;s proposed threshold of to classify animals as megafauna. However, for freshwater species, is the preferred threshold. Some scientists define herbivorous terrestrial megafauna as having a weight exceeding , and terrestrial carnivorous megafauna as more than . Additionally, Owen-Smith coined the term megaherbivore to describe herbivores that weighed over , which has seen some use by other researchers.

Among living animals, the term megafauna is most commonly used for the largest extant terrestrial mammals, which includes (but is not limited to) elephants, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and larger bovines. Of these five categories of large herbivores, only bovines are presently found outside of Africa and Asia, but all the others were formerly more wide-ranging, with their ranges and populations continually shrinking and decreasing over time. Wild equines are another example of megafauna, but their current ranges are largely restricted to the Old World, specifically in Africa and Asia. Megafaunal species may be categorized according to their dietary type: megaherbivores (e.g., elephants), megacarnivores (e.g., lions), and megaomnivores (e.g., bears).

==Ecological strategy==
Megafauna animals – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally &quot;K&quot;-strategists, with high longevity, slow population growth rates, low mortality rates, and (at least for the largest) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults. These characteristics, although not exclusive to such megafauna, make them vulnerable to human overexploitation, in part because of their slow population recovery rates.

==Evolution of large body size==
One observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods. In an examination of mammal body mass changes over time, the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power. This is thought to reflect the emergence, during a trend of increasing maximum body size, of a series of anatomical, physiological, environmental, genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible. A strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass, such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism. When normalized to generation length, the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change.

===In terrestrial mammals===

Subsequent to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about Ma (million years) ago, terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant. Starting from just a few kg before the event, maximum size had reached ~ a few million years later, and ~ by the end of the Paleocene. This trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 Ma ago (in the late Eocene), suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached, after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude. However, when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation, the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of &quot;Indricotherium&quot; 30 Ma ago. (Since generation time scales with &quot;body mass&quot;0.259, increasing generation times with increasing size cause the log mass vs. time plot to curve downward from a linear fit.)

Megaherbivores eventually attained a body mass of over . The largest of these, indricotheres and proboscids, have been hindgut fermenters, which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes. A similar trend emerges when rates of increase of maximum body mass per generation for different mammalian clades are compared (using rates averaged over macroevolutionary time scales). Among terrestrial mammals, the fastest rates of increase of &quot;body mass&quot;0.259 vs. time (in Ma) occurred in perissodactyls (a slope of 2.1), followed by rodents (1.2) and proboscids (1.1), all of which are hindgut fermenters. The rate of increase for artiodactyls (0.74) was about a third of the perissodactyls. The rate for carnivorans (0.65) was slightly lower yet, while primates, perhaps constrained by their arboreal habits, had the lowest rate (0.39) among the mammalian groups studied.

Terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups (the artiodactyl &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; – formerly considered a mesonychid, the oxyaenid &quot;Sarkastodon&quot;, and the carnivorans &quot;Amphicyon&quot; and &quot;Arctodus&quot;) all reached a maximum size of about (the carnivoran &quot;Arctotherium&quot; and the hyaenodontid &quot;Simbakubwa&quot; may have been somewhat larger). The largest known metatherian carnivore, &quot;Proborhyaena gigantea&quot;, apparently reached , also close to this limit. A similar theoretical maximum size for mammalian carnivores has been predicted based on the metabolic rate of mammals, the energetic cost of obtaining prey, and the maximum estimated rate coefficient of prey intake. It has also been suggested that maximum size for mammalian carnivores is constrained by the stress the humerus can withstand at top running speed.

Analysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 Ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size. The former correlation would be consistent with Bergmann&#x27;s rule, and might be related to the thermoregulatory advantage of large body mass in cool climates, better ability of larger organisms to cope with seasonality in food supply, or other factors; the latter correlation could be explained in terms of range and resource limitations. However, the two parameters are interrelated (due to sea level drops accompanying increased glaciation), making the driver of the trends in maximum size more difficult to identify.

===In marine mammals===

Since tetrapods (first reptiles, later mammals) returned to the sea in the Late Permian, they have dominated the top end of the marine body size range, due to the more efficient intake of oxygen possible using lungs. The ancestors of cetaceans are believed to have been the semiaquatic pakicetids, no larger than dogs, of about 53 million years (Ma) ago. By 40 Ma ago, cetaceans had attained a length of or more in &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;, an elongated, serpentine whale that differed from modern whales in many respects and was not ancestral to them. Following this, the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt and then to have backtracked, although the available fossil records are limited. However, in the period from 31 Ma ago (in the Oligocene) to the present, cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass (a rate of increase in &quot;body mass&quot;0.259 of a factor of 3.2 per million years) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals. This trend led to the largest animal of all time, the modern blue whale. Several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible. Fewer biomechanical constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity, and with swimming movements as opposed to terrestrial locomotion. Also, the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the thermoregulatory advantage of large body size in marine endotherms, although diminishing returns apply.

Among the toothed whales, maximum body size appears to be limited by food availability. Larger size, as in sperm and beaked whales, facilitates deeper diving to access relatively easily-caught, large cephalopod prey in a less competitive environment. Compared to odontocetes, the efficiency of baleen whales&#x27; filter feeding scales more favorably with increasing size when planktonic food is dense, making larger sizes more advantageous. The lunge feeding technique of rorquals appears to be more energy efficient than the ram feeding of balaenid whales; the latter technique is used with less dense and patchy plankton. The cooling trend in Earth&#x27;s recent history may have generated more localities of high plankton abundance via wind-driven upwellings, facilitating the evolution of gigantic whales.

Cetaceans are not the only marine mammals to reach tremendous sizes. The largest mammal carnivorans of all time are marine pinnipeds, the largest of which is the southern elephant seal, which can reach more than in length and weigh up to . Other large pinnipeds include the northern elephant seal at , walrus at , and Steller sea lion at . The sirenians are another group of marine mammals which adapted to fully aquatic life around the same time as the cetaceans did. Sirenians are closely related to elephants. The largest sirenian was the Steller&#x27;s sea cow, which reached up to in length and weighed , and was hunted to extinction in the 18th century.

===In flightless birds===

Because of the small initial size of all mammals following the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, nonmammalian vertebrates had a roughly ten-million-year-long window of opportunity (during the Paleocene) for evolution of gigantism without much competition. During this interval, apex predator niches were often occupied by reptiles, such as terrestrial crocodilians (e.g. &quot;Pristichampsus&quot;), large snakes (e.g. &quot;Titanoboa&quot;) or varanid lizards, or by flightless birds (e.g. &quot;Paleopsilopterus&quot; in South America). This is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous gastornithid birds evolved in the Northern Hemisphere, while flightless paleognaths evolved to large size on Gondwanan land masses and Europe. Gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in Europe, both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below (in contrast with other landmasses like North America and Asia, which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals) and were the largest European tetrapods in the Paleocene.

Flightless paleognaths, termed ratites, have traditionally been viewed as representing a lineage separate from that of their small flighted relatives, the Neotropic tinamous. However, recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree, and are the sister group of the extinct moa of New Zealand. Similarly, the small kiwi of New Zealand have been found to be the sister group of the extinct elephant birds of Madagascar. These findings indicate that flightlessness and gigantism arose independently multiple times among ratites via parallel evolution.

Predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early Cenozoic. Later in the Cenozoic, however, they were displaced by advanced carnivorans and died out. In North America, the bathornithids &quot;Paracrax&quot; and &quot;Bathornis&quot; were apex predators but became extinct by the Early Miocene. In South America, the related phorusrhacids shared the dominant predatory niches with metatherian sparassodonts during most of the Cenozoic but declined and ultimately went extinct after eutherian predators arrived from North America (as part of the Great American Interchange) during the Pliocene. In contrast, large herbivorous flightless ratites have survived to the present.

However, none of the flightless birds of the Cenozoic, including the predatory &quot;Brontornis&quot;, possibly omnivorous &quot;Dromornis stirtoni&quot; or herbivorous &quot;Aepyornis&quot;, ever grew to masses much above , and thus never attained the size of the largest mammalian carnivores, let alone that of the largest mammalian herbivores. It has been suggested that the increasing thickness of avian eggshells in proportion to egg mass with increasing egg size places an upper limit on the size of birds. The largest species of &quot;Dromornis&quot;, &quot;D. stirtoni&quot;, may have gone extinct after it attained the maximum avian body mass and was then outcompeted by marsupial diprotodonts that evolved to sizes several times larger.

===In giant turtles===
Giant tortoises were important components of late Cenozoic megafaunas, being present in every nonpolar continent until the arrival of homininans. The largest known terrestrial tortoise was &quot;Megalochelys atlas&quot;, an animal that probably weighed about .

Some earlier aquatic Testudines, e.g. the marine &quot;Archelon&quot; of the Cretaceous and freshwater &quot;Stupendemys&quot; of the Miocene, were considerably larger, weighing more than .

==Megafaunal mass extinctions==

===Timing and possible causes===


Numerous extinctions occurred during the latter half of the Last Glacial Period when most large mammals went extinct in the Americas, Australia-New Guinea, and Eurasia, including over 80% of all terrestrial animals with a body mass greater than . Small animals and other organisms like plants were generally unaffected by the extinctions, which is unprecented in previous extinctions during the last 30 million years.

Various theories have attributed the wave of extinctions to human hunting, climate change, disease, extraterrestrial impact, competition from other animals or other causes. However, this extinction near the end of the Pleistocene was just one of a series of megafaunal extinction pulses that have occurred during the last 50,000 years over much of the Earth&#x27;s surface, with Africa and Asia (where the local megafauna had a chance to evolve alongside modern humans) being comparatively less affected. The latter areas did suffer gradual attrition of megafauna, particularly of the slower-moving species (a class of vulnerable megafauna epitomized by giant tortoises), over the last several million years.

Outside the mainland of Afro-Eurasia, these megafaunal extinctions followed a highly distinctive landmass-by-landmass pattern that closely parallels the spread of humans into previously uninhabited regions of the world, and which shows no overall correlation with climatic history (which can be visualized with plots over recent geological time periods of climate markers such as marine oxygen isotopes or atmospheric carbon dioxide levels). Australia and nearby islands (e.g., Flores) were struck first around 46,000 years ago, followed by Tasmania about 41,000 years ago (after formation of a land bridge to Australia about 43,000 years ago). The role of humans in the extinction of Australia and New Guinea&#x27;s megafauna has been disputed, with multiple studies showing a decline in the number of species prior to the arrival of humans on the continent and the absence of any evidence of human predation; the impact of climate change has instead been cited for their decline. Similarly, Japan lost most of its megafauna apparently about 30,000 years ago, North America 13,000 years ago and South America about 500 years later, Cyprus 10,000 years ago, the Antilles 6,000 years ago, New Caledonia and nearby islands 3,000 years ago, Madagascar 2,000 years ago, New Zealand 700 years ago, the Mascarenes 400 years ago, and the Commander Islands 250 years ago. Nearly all of the world&#x27;s isolated islands could furnish similar examples of extinctions occurring shortly after the arrival of humans, though most of these islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands, never had terrestrial megafauna, so their extinct fauna were smaller, but still displayed island gigantism.

An analysis of the timing of Holarctic megafaunal extinctions and extirpations over the last 56,000 years has revealed a tendency for such events to cluster within interstadials, periods of abrupt warming, but only when humans were also present. Humans may have impeded processes of migration and recolonization that would otherwise have allowed the megafaunal species to adapt to the climate shift. In at least some areas, interstadials were periods of expanding human populations.

An analysis of &quot;Sporormiella&quot; fungal spores (which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores) in swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from Lynch&#x27;s Crater in Queensland, Australia, showed that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago, at a time when climate changes were minimal; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal, and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant sclerophyll vegetation. The high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna, and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire. The increase in fire lagged the disappearance of megafauna by about a century, and most likely resulted from accumulation of fuel once browsing stopped. Over the next several centuries grass increased; sclerophyll vegetation increased with a lag of another century, and a sclerophyll forest developed after about another thousand years. During two periods of climate change about 120,000 and 75,000 years ago, sclerophyll vegetation had also increased at the site in response to a shift to cooler, drier conditions; neither of these episodes had a significant impact on megafaunal abundance. Similar conclusions regarding the culpability of human hunters in the disappearance of Pleistocene megafauna were derived from high-resolution chronologies obtained via an analysis of a large collection of eggshell fragments of the flightless Australian bird &quot;Genyornis newtoni&quot;, from analysis of &quot;Sporormiella&quot; fungal spores from a lake in eastern North America and from study of deposits of Shasta ground sloth dung left in over half a dozen caves in the American Southwest.

Continuing human hunting and environmental disturbance has led to additional megafaunal extinctions in the recent past, and has created a serious danger of further extinctions in the near future (see examples below). Direct killing by humans, primarily for meat or other body parts, is the most significant factor in contemporary megafaunal decline.

A number of other mass extinctions occurred earlier in Earth&#x27;s geologic history, in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out. Famously, in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, the non-avian dinosaurs and most other giant reptiles were eliminated. However, the earlier mass extinctions were more global and not so selective for megafauna; i.e., many species of other types, including plants, marine invertebrates and plankton, went extinct as well. Thus, the earlier events must have been caused by more generalized types of disturbances to the biosphere.

===Consequences of depletion of megafauna===
Depletion of herbivorous megafauna results in increased growth of woody vegetation, and a consequent increase in wildfire frequency. Megafauna may help to suppress the growth of invasive plants. Large herbivores and carnivores can suppress the abundance of smaller animals, resulting in their population increase when megafauna are removed. 

==== Effect on nutrient transport ====
Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death). In South America&#x27;s Amazon Basin, it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98% following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago. Given that phosphorus availability is thought to limit productivity in much of the region, the decrease in its transport from the western part of the basin and from floodplains (both of which derive their supply from the uplift of the Andes) to other areas is thought to have significantly impacted the region&#x27;s ecology, and the effects may not yet have reached their limits. In the sea, cetaceans and pinnipeds that feed at depth are thought to translocate nitrogen from deep to shallow water, enhancing ocean productivity, and counteracting the activity of zooplankton, which tend to do the opposite.

====Effect on methane emissions====
Large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of methane, which is an important greenhouse gas. Modern ruminant herbivores produce methane as a byproduct of foregut fermentation in digestion and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual methane emissions come from livestock methane release. In the Mesozoic, it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually, contributing to the warmer climate of the time (up to 10 °C (18 °F) warmer than at present). This large emission follows from the enormous estimated biomass of sauropods, and because methane production of individual herbivores is believed to be almost proportional to their mass.

Recent studies have indicated that the extinction of megafaunal herbivores may have caused a reduction in atmospheric methane. This hypothesis is relatively new. One study examined the methane emissions from the bison that occupied the Great Plains of North America before contact with European settlers. The study estimated that the removal of the bison caused a decrease of as much as 2.2 million tons per year. Another study examined the change in the methane concentration in the atmosphere at the end of the Pleistocene epoch after the extinction of megafauna in the Americas. After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 BP, their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the Younger Dryas. The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in ice cores, was 2 to 4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.

<doc id="162784" wikidata="Q332818" url="?curid=162784" title="Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton">
<text>Edward Arthur Alexander Shackleton, Baron Shackleton (15 July 1911 – 22 September 1994) was a British geographer, Royal Air Force officer and Labour Party politician.

==Early life and career==
Born in Wandsworth, London, Shackleton was the younger son of Emily Mary and Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Antarctic explorer. Edward Shackleton was educated at Radley College, an independent boarding school for boys in Oxfordshire, followed by Magdalen College, Oxford.

Shackleton arranged the 1932 Oxford University Exploration Club expedition to Sarawak in Borneo organised by Tom Harrisson. During this trip, he made the first ascent of Mount Mulu.

In 1934 Shackleton organised the Oxford University Ellesmere Land Expedition and chose Gordon Noel Humphreys to lead it. Shackleton accompanied the party as assistant surveyor to Humphreys. The expedition was eventually responsible for naming Mount Oxford (after the University of Oxford) and the British Empire Range. On leaving the university, he worked as a Talks Producer for the BBC in Northern Ireland – an experience that turned him away from the Conservatives towards Labour.

===Royal Air Force service===
Shackleton served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. On 29 July 1940, he was commissioned into the Administrative and Special Duties Branch, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, as a pilot officer on probation. On 1 March 1941, he was promoted and granted the war substantive rank of flying officer. Following the probationary period, his commission was confirmed on 29 July 1941. He was promoted to flight lieutenant (temporary) on 1 September 1942, and made a war substantive flight lieutenant on 15 February 1944. He was an acting squadron leader by June 1944, and an acting wing commander by June 1945.

In 1944, Shackleton was mentioned in despatches. In the 1945 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

Shackleton relinquished his commission on 15 July 1956 and was granted permission to retain the rank of wing commander.

==Political life==
Shackleton stood unsuccessfully for Labour at Epsom in the 1945 general election and in the 1945 Bournemouth by-election. In 1946, he was elected for Labour as Member of Parliament for Preston in a by-election. In 1949 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of Supply, George Strauss.

A boundary change divided Preston into two seats, and in 1950 Shackleton was elected as MP for Preston South on a much-reduced majority. The following year, he was promoted to be PPS to Lord President of the Council and Foreign Secretary Herbert Morrison, one of the heavyweight political figures in the post-war government. He was re-elected in 1951.

At the 1955 election, he was defeated. Hugh Gaitskell recommended Shackleton to the Prime Minister, and on 11 August 1958 he was created a life peer by letters patent as Baron Shackleton, of Burley in the County of Southampton. Shackleton delivered his maiden speech in the House of Lords on 11 November 1958, in a debate on a Wages Councils bill, one he thoroughly approved of and welcomed, to increase understanding between unions and management.

In Harold Wilson&#x27;s government, he served as Minister of Defence for the RAF 1964–67. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1966 and made Deputy Leader of the House of Lords a year later. As Minister without Portfolio, 1967–1968, and Paymaster General in 1968, he had a seat on the cabinet. During the Aden Emergency he was sent on a Special Mission as British Resident to help with the British withdrawal.

In April 1968, after the budget, Wilson made Shackleton Leader of the House of Lords, succeeding the Earl of Longford.

Shackleton was active in Wilson&#x27;s proposals for House of Lords reform, designed to reduce the Lords delaying powers from two years to just six months, and he liaised between committees and sub-committees, but in April 1969 Wilson dropped the bill to &quot;concentrate on priorities.&quot; Sitting on the committee for Civil Service Reform, Shackleton successfully widened access to entry for scientists.

Shackleton remained Leader of the House of Lords until a Conservative government was elected in 1970 and thereafter was Opposition Leader in the Lords.

From 1971, Shackleton was President of the Royal Geographical Society. Lord Shackleton was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in 1974. From 1976 until 1992 he was Chairman of the joint-Political Honours and Scrutiny Committee. Lord Shackleton&#x27;s report, commissioned by James Callaghan described the economic future of the Falkland Islands, the value of the being British to the islanders, and how their lot could be improved. It included the invaluable role eventually played by HMS &quot;Endurance&quot;.

Between 1988 and 1989 he chaired the Lords Science and Technology Committee and in 1989 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society under Statute 12, effectively an honorary fellow. He also served as Chairman of the East European Trade Council

In 1990 Shackleton was appointed an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), Australia&#x27;s highest civilian honour, &quot;for service to Australian/British relations, particularly through the Britain–Australia Society.

Lord Shackleton was Pro-Chancellor of the University of Southampton, in which role he was deeply interested in the development of geography at Southampton. A portrait photograph of Lord Shackleton was unveiled by his daughter Alexandra Shackleton in December 1997 in the university&#x27;s Shackleton Building, which houses the Departments of Geography and Psychology.

In 1994 he became the Life President of the newly founded James Caird Society, named after the boat in which his explorer father and crew escaped Antarctica (itself, in turn, named for James Key Caird [1837–1916], jute baron and philanthropist). He acted also as patron of the British Schools Exploring Society (B.S.E.S.) from 1962 until his death in Winchester.

==Personal life==
In 1938 Shackleton married Betty Homan, and they had two children, Alexandra (born 1940) and Charles (1942–1979).

==Arms==
Lord Shackleton&#x27;s Garter banner, which hung in St. George&#x27;s Chapel in Windsor during his lifetime, is now on display in Christ Church Cathedral, Falkland Islands.

<doc id="162789" wikidata="Q208628" url="?curid=162789" title="Hagiography">
<text>A hagiography (; ) is a biography of a saint or an ecclesiastical leader, as well as, by extension, an adulatory and idealized biography of a preacher, priest, founder, saint, monk, nun or icon in any of the world&#x27;s religions. Early Christian hagiographies might consist of a biography or (from Latin &quot;vita&quot;, life, which begins the title of most medieval biographies), a description of the saint&#x27;s deeds or miracles, an account of the saint&#x27;s martyrdom (called a ), or be a combination of these.

Christian hagiographies focus on the lives, and notably the miracles, ascribed to men and women canonized by the Roman Catholic church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox churches, and the Church of the East. Other religious traditions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Islam, Sikhism and Jainism also create and maintain hagiographical texts (such as the Sikh Janamsakhis) concerning saints, gurus and other individuals believed to be imbued with sacred power.

Hagiographic works, especially those of the Middle Ages, can incorporate a record of institutional and local history, and evidence of popular cults, customs, and traditions. 

However, when referring to modern, non-ecclesiastical works, the term is often used today as a pejorative reference to biographies and histories whose authors are perceived to be uncritical or excessively reverential toward their subject.

== Christianity ==

=== Development ===
Hagiography constituted an important literary genre in the early Christian church, providing some informational history along with the more inspirational stories and legends. A hagiographic account of an individual saint could consist of a biography (&#x27;), a description of the saint&#x27;s deeds or miracles, an account of the saint&#x27;s martyrdom (&#x27;), or be a combination of these.

The genre of lives of the saints first came into being in the Roman Empire as legends about Christian martyrs were recorded. The dates of their deaths formed the basis of martyrologies. In the 4th century, there were three main types of catalogs of lives of the saints:
* annual calendar catalogue, or &quot;menaion&quot; (in Greek, , means &quot;monthly&quot; (adj, neut), lit. &quot;lunar&quot;), biographies of the saints to be read at sermons;
* &quot;synaxarion&quot; (&quot;something that collects&quot;; Greek , from , i.e. &quot;gathering&quot;, &quot;collection&quot;, &quot;compilation&quot;), or a short version of lives of the saints, arranged by dates;
* &quot;paterikon&quot; (&quot;that of the Fathers&quot;; Greek ; in Greek and Latin, means &quot;father&quot;), or biography of the specific saints, chosen by the catalog compiler.
The earliest lives of saints focused on desert fathers who lived as ascetics from the 4th century onwards. The life of Anthony of Egypt is usually considered the first example of this new genre of Christian biography. 

In Western Europe, hagiography was one of the more important vehicles for the study of inspirational history during the Middle Ages. The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; of Jacobus de Voragine compiled a great deal of medieval hagiographic material, with a strong emphasis on miracle tales. Lives were often written to promote the cult of local or national states, and in particular to develop pilgrimages to visit relics. The bronze Gniezno Doors of Gniezno Cathedral in Poland are the only Romanesque doors in Europe to feature the life of a saint. The life of Saint Adalbert of Prague, who is buried in the cathedral, is shown in 18 scenes, probably based on a lost illuminated copy of one of his Lives.

The Bollandist Society continues the study, academic assembly, appraisal and publication of materials relating to the lives of Christian saints (see &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;).

=== Medieval England ===
Many of the important hagiographical texts composed in medieval England were written in the vernacular dialect Anglo-Norman. With the introduction of Latin literature into England in the 7th and 8th centuries the genre of the life of the saint grew increasingly popular. When one contrasts it to the popular heroic poem, such as &quot;Beowulf&quot;, one finds that they share certain common features. In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the titular character battles against Grendel and his mother, while the saint, such as Athanasius&#x27; Anthony (one of the original sources for the hagiographic motif) or the character of Guthlac, battles against figures no less substantial in a spiritual sense. Both genres then focus on the hero-warrior figure, but with the distinction that the saint is of a spiritual sort.

Imitation of the life of Christ was then the benchmark against which saints were measured, and imitation of the lives of saints was the benchmark against which the general population measured itself. In Anglo-Saxon and medieval England, hagiography became a literary genre par excellence for the teaching of a largely illiterate audience. Hagiography provided priests and theologians with classical handbooks in a form that allowed them the rhetorical tools necessary to present their faith through the example of the saints&#x27; lives.

Of all the English hagiographers no one was more prolific nor so aware of the importance of the genre as Abbot Ælfric of Eynsham. His work &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; contains set of sermons on saints&#x27; days, formerly observed by the English Church. The text comprises two prefaces, one in Latin and one in Old English, and 39 lives beginning on 25 December with the nativity of Christ and ending with three texts to which no saints&#x27; days are attached. The text spans the entire year and describes the lives of many saints, both English and continental, and harks back to some of the earliest saints of the early church.

There are two known instances where saint&#x27;s lives were adapted into vernacular plays in Britain. These are the Cornish-language works &quot;Beunans Meriasek&quot; and &quot;Beunans Ke&quot;, about the lives of Saints Meriasek and Kea, respectively.

Other examples of hagiographies from England include:
* the &quot;Chronicle&quot; by Hugh Candidus
* the Secgan Manuscript
* the list of John Leyland
* possibly the book &quot;Life&quot; by Saint Cadog
* &quot;Vita Sancti Ricardi Episcopi et Confessoris Cycestrensis&quot;/ Life of Richard of Chichester by Ralph Bocking.
* The Book of Margery Kempe is an example of autohagiography, in which the subject dictates her life using the hagiographic form.

=== Medieval Ireland ===

Ireland is notable in its rich hagiographical tradition, and for the large amount of material which was produced during the Middle Ages. Irish hagiographers wrote primarily in Latin while some of the later saint&#x27;s lives were written in the hagiographer&#x27;s native vernacular Irish. Of particular note are the lives of St. Patrick, St. Columba (Latin)/Colum Cille (Irish) and St. Brigit/Brigid—Ireland&#x27;s three patron saints. The earliest extant Life was written by Cogitosus. Additionally, several Irish calendars relating to the feastdays of Christian saints (sometimes called martyrologies or feastologies) contained abbreviated synopses of saint&#x27;s lives, which were compiled from many different sources. Notable examples include the Martyrology of Tallaght and the Félire Óengusso. Such hagiographical calendars were important in establishing lists of native Irish saints, in imitation of continental calendars.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===

In the 10th century, a Byzantine monk Simeon Metaphrastes was the first one to change the genre of lives of the saints into something different, giving it a moralizing and panegyrical character. His catalog of lives of the saints became the standard for all of the Western and Eastern hagiographers, who would create relative biographies and images of the ideal saints by gradually departing from the real facts of their lives. Over the years, the genre of lives of the saints had absorbed a number of narrative plots and poetic images (often, of pre-Christian origin, such as dragon fighting etc.), mediaeval parables, short stories and anecdotes.

The genre of lives of the saints was introduced in the Slavic world in the Bulgarian Empire in the late 9th and early 10th century, where the first original hagiographies were produced on Cyril and Methodius, Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav. Eventually the Bulgarians brought this genre to Kievan Rus&#x27; together with writing and also in translations from the Greek language. In the 11th century, they began to compile the original life stories of their first saints, e.g. Boris and Gleb, Theodosius Pechersky etc. In the 16th century, Metropolitan Macarius expanded the list of the Russian saints and supervised the compiling process of their life stories. They would all be compiled in the so-called &quot;Velikiye chet&#x27;yi-minei&quot; catalog (Великие Четьи-Минеи, or Great Menaion Reader), consisting of 12 volumes in accordance with each month of the year. They were revised and expanded by St. Dimitry of Rostov in 1684–1705.

The &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; was a particularly notable hagiographic work of the era.

Today, the works in the genre of lives of the saints represent a valuable historical source and reflection of different social ideas, world outlook and aesthetic concepts of the past.

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
The Oriental Orthodox Churches also have their own hagiographic traditions. For instance, Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church hagiographies in the Ge&#x27;ez language are known as &quot;gadl&quot; (Saint&#x27;s Life). There are some 200 hagiographies about indigenous saints. They are among the most important Medieval Ethiopian written sources, and some have accurate historical information. They are written by the disciples of the saints. Some were written a long time after the death of a saint, but others were written not long after the saint&#x27;s demise. Fragments from an Old Nubian hagiography of Saint Michael are extant.

== Judaism ==
Jewish hagiographic writings are common in the case of Talmudic and Kabbalistic writings and later in the Hasidic movement.

== Islam ==
Hagiography in Islam began in the Arabic language with biographical writing about the Prophet Muhammad in the 8th century CE, a tradition known as &quot;sīra&quot;. From about the 10th century CE, a genre generally known as &quot;manāqib&quot; also emerged, which comprised biographies of the imams (&quot;madhāhib&quot;) who founded different schools of Islamic thought (&quot;madhhab&quot;) about &quot;shariʿa&quot;, and of Ṣūfī saints. Over time, hagiography about Ṣūfīs and their miracles came to predominate in the genre of &quot;manāqib&quot;.

Likewise influenced by early Islamic research into hadiths and other biographical information about the Prophet, Persian scholars began writing Persian hagiography, again mainly of Sūfī saints, in the eleventh century CE.

The Islamicisation of the Turkish regions led to the development of Turkish biographies of saints, beginning in the 13th century CE and gaining pace around the 16th. Production remained dynamic and kept pace with scholarly developments in historical biographical writing until 1925, when Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (d. 1938) placed an interdiction on Ṣūfī brotherhoods. As Turkey relaxed legal restrictions on Islamic practice in the 1950s and the 1980s, Ṣūfīs returned to publishing hagiography, a trend which continues in the 21st century.

==Other groups==
The pseudobiography of L. Ron Hubbard compiled by the Church of Scientology is commonly described as a heavily fictionalized hagiography.

<text>The Cabinet of the United Kingdom is the senior decision-making body of the Government of the United Kingdom. A committee of the Privy Council, it is chaired by the Prime Minister and its members include Secretaries of State and senior Ministers of State. Members of the Cabinet are appointed by the Prime Minister and are by convention chosen from members of the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the House of Commons and the House of Lords. 

The Ministerial Code says that the business of the Cabinet (and cabinet committees) is mainly questions of major issues of policy, questions of critical importance to the public and questions on which there is an unresolved argument between departments.

The work of the Cabinet is scrutinised by the Shadow Cabinet, made up of members of the Official Opposition.

==History==

Until at least the 16th century, individual officers of state had separate property, powers and responsibilities granted with their separate offices by royal command, and the Crown and the Privy Council constituted the only co-ordinating authorities. In England, phrases such as &quot;cabinet counsel&quot;, meaning advice given in private, in a cabinet in the sense of a small room, to the monarch, occur from the late 16th century, and, given the non-standardised spelling of the day, it is often hard to distinguish whether &quot;council&quot; or &quot;counsel&quot; is meant. The &quot;OED&quot; credits Francis Bacon in his &quot;Essays&quot; (1605) with the first use of &quot;Cabinet council&quot;, where it is described as a foreign habit, of which he disapproves: &quot;For which inconveniences, the doctrine of Italy, and practice of France, in some kings&#x27; times, hath introduced cabinet counsels; a remedy worse than the disease&quot;. Charles I began a formal &quot;Cabinet Council&quot; from his accession in 1625, as his Privy Council, or &quot;private council&quot;, and the first recorded use of &quot;cabinet&quot; by itself for such a body comes from 1644, and is again hostile and associates the term with dubious foreign practices.

There were ministries in England led by the chief minister, which was a personage leading the English government for the monarch. Despite primary accountability to the monarch, these ministries, having a group of ministers running the country, served as a predecessor of the modern perspective of cabinet. After the ministry of Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland collapsed, Sir Robert Walpole rose to power as First Lord of the Treasury. Since the reign of King George I the Cabinet has been the principal executive group of British government. Both he and George II made use of the system, as both were not native English speakers, unfamiliar with British politics, and thus relied heavily on selected groups of advisers. The term &quot;minister&quot; came into being since the royal officers &quot;ministered&quot; to the sovereign. The name and institution have been adopted by most English-speaking countries, and the Council of Ministers or similar bodies of other countries are often informally referred to as cabinets.

The modern Cabinet system was set up by Prime Minister David Lloyd George during his premiership, 1916–1922, with a Cabinet Office and secretariat, committee structures, unpublished minutes, and a clearer relationship with departmental Cabinet ministers. The formal procedures, practice and proceedings of the Cabinet remain largely unpublished.

This development grew out of the exigencies of the First World War, where faster and better co-ordinated decisions across government were seen as a crucial part of the war effort. Decisions on mass conscription, co-ordination worldwide with other governments across international theatres, and armament production tied into a general war strategy that could be developed and overseen from an inner &quot;War Cabinet&quot;. The country went through successive crises after the war: the 1926 general strike; the Great Depression of 1929–32; the rise of Bolshevism after 1917 and fascism after 1922; the Spanish Civil War 1936 onwards; the invasion of Abyssinia 1936; the League of Nations Crisis which followed; and the re-armament and resurgence of Germany from 1933, leading into the Second World War.

==Composition==
The Prime Minister decides the membership and attendees of the Cabinet.

The total number of Cabinet ministers who are entitled to a salary is capped by statute at 21, plus the Lord Chancellor, who is paid separately. Some ministers may be designated as also attending Cabinet, like the Attorney General, as &quot;...it has been considered more appropriate, in recent times at any rate, that the independence and detachment of his office should not be blurred by his inclusion in a political body – that is to say the Cabinet – which may have to make policy decisions upon the basis of the legal advice the law officers have given.&quot;

The Cabinet is a committee of the Privy Council (though this interpretation has been challenged) and, as such, all Cabinet ministers must be privy counsellors.

Members of the Cabinet are by convention chosen from members of the two houses of Parliament, as convention dictates that ministers may only be recruited from the House of Commons or the House of Lords, although this convention has been broken in the past for short periods. Patrick Gordon Walker is perhaps the most notable exception: he was appointed to the Cabinet despite losing his seat in the 1964 general election, and resigned from Cabinet after running and losing in a by-election in January 1965. Sometimes, when a minister from neither House is appointed, they have been granted a customary peerage. The Cabinet is now made up almost entirely of members of the House of Commons.

Civil servants from the Cabinet Secretariat and special advisers (on the approval of the prime minister) can also attend Cabinet meetings, but neither take part in discussions.

It has been suggested that the modern Cabinet is too large, including by former Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill and scholars Robert Hazell and Rodney Brazier. Hazell has suggested merging the offices of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales into one Secretary of State for the Union, in a department into which Rodney Brazier has suggested adding a minister of state for England with responsibility for English local government.

==Meetings of the cabinet==

Most cabinet meetings take place in the Cabinet Room of 10 Downing Street; however, they have been known to take place in other places.

Despite the custom of meeting on a Thursday, after the appointment of Gordon Brown, the meeting day was switched to Tuesday. However, when David Cameron became prime minister, he held his cabinet meetings on Thursdays again. Upon Theresa May&#x27;s tenure, she switched the cabinet meetings back to Tuesday.

The length of meetings varies according to the style of the Prime Minister and political conditions, but modern meetings can be as short as 30 minutes. Ministers are bound by the constitutional convention of collective ministerial responsibility.

==Importance==

Cabinet ministers, like all ministers, are appointed and may be dismissed by the monarch without notice or reason, on the advice of the prime minister. The allocation and transfer of responsibilities between ministers and departments is also generally at the prime minister&#x27;s discretion. The Cabinet has always been led by the prime minister, whose originally unpaid office as such was traditionally described as merely (first among equals), but today the prime minister is the preeminent head of government, with the effective power to appoint and dismiss Cabinet ministers and to control the Cabinet&#x27;s agenda. The extent to which the Government is collegial varies with political conditions and individual personalities.

The Cabinet is the ultimate decision-making body of the executive within the Westminster system of government in traditional constitutional theory. This interpretation was originally put across in the work of 19th-century constitutionalists such as Walter Bagehot, who described the Cabinet as the &quot;efficient secret&quot; of the British political system in his book &quot;The English Constitution&quot;. The political and decision-making authority of the cabinet has been gradually reduced over the last several decades, with some claiming its role has been usurped by a &quot;prime ministerial&quot; government. In the modern political era, the prime minister releases information concerning the ministerial ranking in the form of a list detailing the seniority of all Cabinet ministers.

The centralisation of the Cabinet in the early 20th century enhanced the power of the prime minister, who moved from being the &quot;primus inter pares&quot; of the Asquith Cabinets of 1906 onwards, to the dominating figures of David Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin, and Winston Churchill.

The Institute for Government claims that the reduced number of full Cabinet meetings signifies &quot;that the role of Cabinet as a formal decision-making body has been in decline since the war.&quot; This view has been contradicted by Vernon Bogdanor, a British constitutional expert, who claims that &quot;the Cabinet has, in fact, been strengthened by the decline in full meetings, as it allows more matters to be transferred to cabinet committees. Thus, business is done more efficiently.&quot;

Most prime ministers have had a so-called &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; consisting of their own trusted advisers who may be Cabinet members but are often non-cabinet trusted personal advisers on their own staff. In recent governments, generally from Margaret Thatcher, and especially in that of Tony Blair, it has been reported that many or even all major decisions have been made before cabinet meetings. This suggestion has been made by former ministers including Clare Short and Chris Smith, in the media, and was made clear in the Butler Review, where Blair&#x27;s style of &quot;sofa government&quot; was censured.

The combined effect of the prime minister&#x27;s ability to control Cabinet by circumventing effective discussion in Cabinet and the executive&#x27;s ability to dominate parliamentary proceedings places the British prime minister in a position of great power, that has been likened to an elective dictatorship (a phrase coined by Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone in 1976). The relative inability of Parliament to hold the Government of the day to account is often cited by the UK media as a justification for the vigour with which they question and challenge the Government.

The classic view of Cabinet Government was laid out by Walter Bagehot in &quot;The English Constitution&quot; (1867) in which he described the prime minister as the &quot;primus-inter-pares&quot; (&quot;first among equals&quot;). The view was questioned by Richard Crossman in &quot;The Myths of Cabinet Government&quot; (1972) and by Tony Benn. They were both members of the Labour governments of the 1960s and thought that the position of the prime minister had acquired more power so that prime ministerial government was a more apt description. Crossman stated that the increase in the power of the prime minister resulted from power of centralised political parties, the development of a unified civil service, and the growth of the prime minister&#x27;s private office and Cabinet secretariat.

Graham Allen (a government whip during Tony Blair&#x27;s first government) makes the case in &quot;The Last Prime Minister: Being Honest About the UK Presidency&quot; (2003) that the office of prime minister has presidential powers, as did Michael Foley in &quot;The British Presidency&quot; (2000). However, the power that a prime minister has over his or her cabinet colleagues is directly proportional to the amount of support that they have with their political parties and this is often related to whether the party considers them to be an electoral asset or liability. Also when a party is divided into factions a prime minister may be forced to include other powerful party members in the Cabinet for party political cohesion. The Prime Minister&#x27;s personal power is also curtailed if their party is in a power-sharing arrangement, or a formal coalition with another party (as happened in the coalition government of 2010 to 2015).

The current cabinet is led by the newly appointed Prime Minister Keir Starmer and succeeded the Sunak ministry. This is Starmer&#x27;s first cabinet following the 2024 General Election.

Although not defined by a strict set of principles and uniting various approaches, it treats economic development as a process rather than an equilibrium and emphasizes change (qualitative, organisational, and structural), innovation, complex interdependencies, self-evolving systems, and limited rationality as the drivers of economic evolution. The support for the evolutionary approach to economics in recent decades seems to have initially emerged as a criticism of the mainstream neoclassical economics, but by the beginning of the 21st century it had become part of the economic mainstream itself.

Evolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather, it focuses on the non-equilibrium processes that transform the economy from within and their implications, considering interdependencies and feedback. The processes in turn emerge from the actions of diverse agents with bounded rationality who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.

==Roots of evolutionary economics==

===Early ideas===

The idea of human society and the world in general as subject to evolution has been following mankind throughout its existence. Hesiod, an ancient Greek poet thought to be the first Western written poet regarding himself as an individual, described five Ages of Man – the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Heroic Age, and the Iron Age – following from divine existence to toil and misery. Modern scholars consider his works as one of the sources for early economic thought. The concept is also present in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Ovid, an ancient Roman poet. His Four Ages include technological progress: in the Golden Age, men did not know arts and craft, whereas by the Iron Age people had learnt and discovered agriculture, architecture, mining, navigation, and national boundaries, but had also become violent and greedy. This concept was not exclusive to the Greek and Roman civilizations (see, for instance, Yuga Cycles in Hinduism, the Three Ages of Buddhism, Aztecs’ Five Suns), but a common feature is the path towards misery and destruction, with technological advancements accompanied by moral degradation.

===Medieval and early modern times===

Medieval views on society, economics and politics (at least in Europe and &quot;Pax Islamica&quot;) were influenced by religious norms and traditions. Catholic and Islamic scholars debated on the moral appropriateness of certain economic practices, such as interest. The subject of changes was thought of in existential terms. For instance, Augustine of Hippo regarded time as a phenomenon of the universe created by God and a measure of change, whereas God exists outside of time.

A major contribution to the views on the evolution of society was &quot;Leviathan&quot; by Thomas Hobbes. A human, according to Hobbes, is a matter in motion with one&#x27;s own appetites and desires. Due to these numerous desires and the scarcity of resources, the natural state of a human is a war of all against all:

&quot;In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;

In order to overcome this natural anarchy, Hobbs saw it necessary to impose an ultimate restraint in the form of a sovereign. 

===Economic development, natural state, and social evolution===

A landmark work in many senses, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; by Adam Smith was also one to offer a description of economic development throughout the history of mankind — as well as insights into the nature of this development. In &quot;Book III (Of the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations)&quot;, Smith constantly underlines the importance of the natural order of things, which economic improvements follow, and shows the feedback chain that allows economies to progress further, based on what has been achieved. This falls in line with the notion of natural rights shared by other Age of Enlightenment thinkers, such as John Locke and Montesquieu.

A somewhat different view relates to the names of prominent socialists of the 19th century, who viewed economic and political systems as products of social evolution (in contrast to the notions of natural rights and morality). In his book &quot;What is Property?&quot;, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon noted:

“Thus, in a given society, the authority of man over man is inversely proportional to the stage of intellectual development which that society has reached.”

The approach was also employed by Karl Marx. In his view, over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones. Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and inefficiencies that made them impossible to survive in the long term. In Marx&#x27;s scheme, feudalism was replaced by capitalism, which would eventually be superseded by socialism.

==Emergence as a separate field of study==

The term &quot;evolutionary economics&quot; might have been first coined by Thorstein Veblen. Veblen saw the need for taking into account cultural variation in his economic approach; no universal &quot;human nature&quot; could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviours that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule rather than an exception. He also argued that social institutions are subject to selection process and that economic science should embrace the Darwinian theory.

Veblen&#x27;s followers quickly abandoned his evolutionary legacy. When they finally returned to the use of the term “evolutionary”, they referred to development and change in general, without its Darwinian meaning. Further researchers, such as Joseph Schumpeter, studied entrepreneurship and innovation using this term, but not in the Darwinian sense. Another prominent economist, Friedrich von Hayek, also employed the elements of the evolutionary approach, especially criticizing “the fatal conceit” of socialists who believed they could and should design a new society while disregarding human nature. However, Hayek seemed to see the Darwin theory not as a revolution itself, but rather as an intermediary step in the line of evolutionary thinking. There were other notable contributors to the evolutionary approach in economics, such as Armen Alchian, who argued that, faced with uncertainty and incomplete information, firms adapt to the environment instead of pursuing profit maximization.

===&quot;An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change&quot; and beyond===

The publication of &quot;An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change&quot; by Richard R. Nelson and Sidney G. Winter in 1982 marked a turning point in the field of evolutionary economics. Inspired by Alchian&#x27;s work about the decision-making process of firms under uncertainty and the behavioural theory of the firm by Richard Cyert and James March, Nelson and Winter constructed a comprehensive evolutionary theory of business behavior using the concept of natural selection. In this framework, firms operate on the basis of organizational routines, which they evaluate and may change while functioning in a certain selection environment. Since then, evolutionary economics, as noted by Nicolai Foss, has been concerned with “the transformation of already existing structures and the emergence and possible spread of novelties.” Economies have been viewed as a complex system, a result of causal interactions (non-linear and chaotic) between different agents and entities with varied characteristics. Instead of perfect information and rationality, Herbert Simon&#x27;s concept of bounded rationality has become prevailing.

By the 1990s, as put by Geoffrey Hodgson,

“it was possible to write of an international network or ‘invisible college’ of ‘evolutionary economists’ who, despite their analytical differences, were focusing on the problem of analyzing structural, technological, cultural and institutional change in economic systems… They were also united by their common dislike of the static and equilibrium approaches that dominated mainstream economics.”

==Recent developments in evolutionary economics==

The role of evolutionary forces in the process of economic development over the course of human history has been further explored during the past decades. For example, Paul Rubin extensively described how apparent anomalies in decision-making, such as violations of the maximization principle, a zero-sum way of thinking, or a dislike of competition and free trade, may be a result of the human brain evolution. Another concept Rubin and his colleagues viewed through the lenses of evolutionary analysis is the utility function, which may essentially be represented as the fitness evolutionary function.

Elements of evolutionary approach have also appeared in financial economics. Around 2004, Andrew Lo proposed the adaptive market hypothesis — an extension of the efficient market hypothesis that treats financial market agents as &quot;species&quot; who exist in some environment (e.g., the number of competitors, profit opportunities) and behave accordingly. This hypothesis does not deny that efficient financial market equilibria may exist, but it necessarily suggests that other states may emerge and evolve due to adaption and natural selection. Although quite recent, Lo&#x27;s hypothesis has already been empirically tested with regard to a number of cases, such as the analysis of influence of religious holidays and political regimes on financial markets in Islamic countries or the evolution of Bitcoin market.

===The Unified Growth Theory===

A considerable contribution to the understanding of economies as constantly evolving systems was provided by Oded Galor and his colleagues. A pioneer of the Unified Growth Theory, Galor depicts economic growth and development throughout human history as a continuous process driven by technological progress and the accumulation of human capital as well as by the accumulation of those biological, social and cultural features that favour further development.

According to Galor&#x27;s model, technological advancements in the early eras of the mankind (during the Malthusian epoch, with limited resources and near-subsistence levels of income) would lead to increases in the size of population, which in turn would further accelerate technological progress due to the production of new ideas and the increase in demand for them. At some point technological advancements would require higher levels of education and generate the demand for educated labour force. After that, an economy would move into a new phase characterised by demographic transition (given that investment into less children, although more costly, would yield higher returns) and sustained economic growth. The process is accompanied by improvements in living standards, the position of the working class as necessary in order to complement technological progress (contrary to Marx and his followers, who predicted its further impoverishment), and the position of women, paving the way for further social and gender equality improvements. Interdependent, these elements facilitate each other, creating a unified process of growth and development, although the pace may be different for different societies.

In &quot;The Journey of Humanity: The Origins of Wealth and Inequality&quot; (2022) Galor provides some statements that further solidify his evolutionary approach:

“Consider… two large clans: the Quanty and the Qualy…
Suppose that Quanty households bear on average four children each, of whom only two reach adulthood and find a reproductive partner. Meanwhile, Qualy households bear on average only two children each, because their budget does not allow them to invest in the education and health of additional offspring &quot;[sic!]&quot;, and yet, thanks to the investment that they do make, both children not only reach adulthood and find a reproductive partner but they also find jobs in commercial and skill-intensive occupations… Now suppose the society in which they live is one where technological development boosts the demand for the services of blacksmiths, carpenters and other trades who can manufacture tools and more efficient machines. This increase in earning capacity would place the Qualy clan at a distinct &quot;evolutionary advantage&quot;. Within a generation or two, its families are likely to enjoy higher incomes and amass greater resources.”

==Criticism==

The emergence of modern evolutionary economics was welcomed by the critics of the neoclassical mainstream. However, the field, especially the approach by Nelson and Winter, has also drawn critical attitude from other heterodox economists. A year after &quot;An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change&quot; was published, Philip Mirowski expressed his doubts that this framework represented genuine evolutionary economics research (i.e., in the vein of Veblen) and not just a variant of neoclassical methodology, especially since the authors admitted their framework could include neoclassical orthodoxy. Some Veblenian institutionalists claim this framework is only a “protective modification of the neoclassical economics and is antithetical to Veblen&#x27;s evolutionary economics.” Another possible shortcoming (recognized by the proponents of modern evolutionary economics) is that the field is heterogenous, with no convergence on an integrated approach.

==Related fields==

===Evolutionary psychology===

Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in psychology that examines cognition and behaviour from a modern evolutionary perspective. It seeks to identify human psychological adaptations with regards to the ancestral problems they evolved to solve. In this framework, psychological traits and mechanisms are either functional products of natural and sexual selection or non-adaptive by-products of other adaptive traits. Economic concepts can also be viewed through these lenses, as demonstrated by Paul Rubin, among others.

===Evolutionary game theory===

Evolutionary game theory is the application of game theory to evolving populations in biology. It defines a framework of contests, strategies, and analytics into which Darwinian competition can be modelled. It originated in 1973 with John Maynard Smith and George R. Price&#x27;s formalisation of contests, analysed as strategies, and the mathematical criteria that can be used to predict the results of competing strategies.

Evolutionary game theory has helped to explain the basis of altruistic behaviours in Darwinian evolution. It has in turn become of interest to sociologists, anthropologists, philosophers, and economists.

<doc id="162794" wikidata="Q115513" url="?curid=162794" title="Pascal Couchepin">
<text>Pascal Couchepin (born 5 April 1942) is a Swiss politician who served as a Member of the Swiss Federal Council from 1998 to 2009. A member of the Free Democratic Party (FDP/PRD), he was President of the Swiss Confederation twice, in 2003 and 2008. Couchepin headed the Federal Department of Economic Affairs from 1998 to 2002 and Federal Department of Home Affairs from 2003 until 2009.

==Biography==
Couchepin holds a DEA&#x27;s degree in Law from the University of Lausanne. He is a father of three (two daughters and a son) and has two grandchildren.

He was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 11 March 1998 as a member of the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland from the canton of Valais. Previously, he had been Deputy Mayor (1976) and Mayor of Martigny (from 1984), as well as elected to the National Council from 1979 to 1998.
In 1998 he took over the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, in which position he fought against the government contributing any money to the $1.25 billion settlement between Swiss banks and Holocaust survivors. He was quoted as saying that &quot;there is no reason for the Swiss Government to pay anything&quot;, as a government commission had shown &quot;we did what was possible in the hard times of the war.&quot; In 2003 he moved to the Federal Department of Home Affairs. He was the President of the Confederation in 2003. On 13 December 2006, he was elected vice president of the Federal Council for 2007; on 12 December 2007 was elected President of the Confederation for 2008.

During the Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy, also known as the 2006 Regensburg lecture, he stated the Pope&#x27;s speech was &quot;intelligent and necessary.&quot; On 12 June 2009, Couchepin announced his resignation from the Federal Council effective 31 October 2009. This led to an election to fill his vacated seat.

Pascal Couchepin is a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organisation which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organisation composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organisation officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

<doc id="162795" wikidata="Q5396" url="?curid=162795" title="Louis Blériot">
<text>Louis Charles Joseph Blériot ( , , ; 1 July 1872 – 1 August 1936) was a French aviator, inventor, and engineer. He developed the first practical headlamp for cars and established a profitable business manufacturing them, using much of the money he made to finance his attempts to build a successful aircraft. Blériot was the first to use the combination of hand-operated joystick and foot-operated rudder control as used to the present day to operate the aircraft control surfaces. Blériot was also the first to make a working, powered, piloted monoplane. In 1909 he became world-famous for making the first aeroplane flight across the English Channel, winning the prize of £1,000 offered by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper. He was the founder of Blériot Aéronautique, a successful aircraft manufacturing company.

==Early years==
Born at No.17h rue de l&#x27;Arbre à Poires (now rue Sadi-Carnot) in Cambrai, Louis was the first of five children born to Clémence and Charles Blériot. In 1882, aged 10, Blériot was sent as a boarder to the Institut Notre Dame in Cambrai, where he frequently won class prizes, including one for engineering drawing. When he was 15, he moved on to the &quot;lycée&quot; at Amiens, where he lived with an aunt. After passing the exams for his baccalaureate in science and German, he determined to try to enter the prestigious École Centrale in Paris. Entrance was by a demanding exam for which special tuition was necessary: consequently Blériot spent a year at the Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris. He passed the exam, placing 74th among the 243 successful candidates, and doing especially well in the tests of engineering drawing ability. After three years of demanding study at the École Centrale, Blériot graduated 113th of 203 in his graduating class. He then embarked on a term of compulsory military service, and spent a year as a sub-lieutenant in the 24th Artillery Regiment, stationed in Tarbes in the Pyrenees.

He later got a job with Baguès, an electrical engineering company in Paris. He left the company after developing the world&#x27;s first practical headlamp for automobiles, using a compact integral acetylene generator. In 1897, Blériot opened a showroom for headlamps at 41 rue de Richlieu in Paris. The business was successful, and soon he was supplying his lamps to both Renault and Panhard-Levassor, two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day.

In October 1900 Blériot was lunching in his usual restaurant near his showroom when his eye was caught by a young woman dining with her parents. That evening, he told his mother &quot;I saw a young woman today. I will marry her, or I will marry no one.&quot; A bribe to a waiter secured her identity; she was Alice Védères, the daughter of a retired army officer. Blériot set about courting her with the same determination that he later brought to his aviation experiments, and on 21 February 1901 the couple were married.

==Early aviation experiments==

Blériot had become interested in aviation while at the Ecole Centrale, but his serious experimentation was probably sparked by seeing Clément Ader&#x27;s Avion III at the 1900 Exposition Universelle. By then his headlamp business was doing well enough for Blériot to be able to devote both time and money to experimentation. His first experiments were with a series of ornithopters, which were unsuccessful. In April 1905, Blériot met Gabriel Voisin, who was then employed by Ernest Archdeacon to assist with his experimental gliders.

Blériot was a spectator at Voisin&#x27;s first trials of the floatplane glider he had built on 8 June 1905. Cine photography was among Blériot&#x27;s hobbies, and the film footage of this flight was shot by him. The success of these trials prompted him to commission a similar machine from Voisin, the Blériot II glider. On 18 July an attempt to fly this aircraft was made, ending in a crash in which Voisin nearly drowned, but this did not deter Blériot. Indeed, he suggested that Voisin should stop working for Archdeacon and enter into partnership with him. Voisin accepted the proposal, and together with his brother Charles Voisin and Edouard Surcouf they established the &quot;Ateliers d&#x27; Aviation Edouard Surcouf, Blériot et Voisin&quot;, possibly the world&#x27;s first aircraft manufacturing company. Active between 1905 and 1906, the company built two unsuccessful powered aircraft, the Blériot III and the Blériot IV, which was largely a rebuild of its predecessor. Both these aircraft were powered with the lightweight Antoinette engines being developed by Léon Levavasseur. Blériot became a shareholder in the company, and in May 1906, joined the board of directors.

The Blériot IV was damaged in a taxiing accident at Bagatelle on 12 November 1906. The disappointment of the failure of his aircraft was compounded by the success of Alberto Santos Dumont later that day, when he managed to fly his 14-bis a distance of , winning the Aéro Club de France prize for the first flight of over 100 metres. This also took place at Bagatelle, and was witnessed by Blériot. The partnership with Voisin was dissolved and Blériot established his own business, Recherches Aéronautiques Louis Blériot, where he started creating his own aircraft, experimenting with various configurations and eventually creating the world&#x27;s first successful powered monoplane.

The first of these, the canard configuration Blériot V, was first tried on 21 March 1907, when Blériot limited his experiments to ground runs, which resulted in damage to the undercarriage. Two further ground trials, also damaging the aircraft, were undertaken, followed by another attempt on 5 April. The flight was only of around 6 m (20 ft), after which he cut his engine and landed, slightly damaging the undercarriage. More trials followed, the last on 19 April when, travelling at a speed of around 50 km/h (30 mph), the aircraft left the ground, Blériot over-responded when the nose began to rise, and the machine hit the ground nose-first, and somersaulted. The aircraft was largely destroyed, but Blériot was, by great good fortune, unhurt. The engine of the aircraft was immediately behind his seat, and he was very lucky not to have been crushed by it.

This was followed by the Blériot VI, a tandem wing design, first tested on 7 July, when the aircraft failed to lift off. Blériot then enlarged the wings slightly, and on 11 July a short successful flight of around 25–30 metres (84–100 ft) was made, reaching an altitude of around 2 m (7 ft). This was Blériot&#x27;s first truly successful flight. Further successful flights took place that month, and by 25 July he had managed a flight of 150 m (490 ft). On 6 August he managed to reach an altitude of 12 m (39 ft), but one of the blades of the propeller worked loose, resulting in a heavy landing which damaged the aircraft. He then fitted a 50 hp (37  kW) V-16 Antoinette engine. Tests on 17 September showed a startling improvement in performance: the aircraft quickly reached an altitude of 25 m (82 ft), when the engine suddenly cut out and the aircraft went into a spiralling nosedive. In desperation Blériot climbed out of his seat and threw himself towards the tail. The aircraft partially pulled out of the dive, and came to earth in a more or less horizontal attitude. His only injuries were some minor cuts on the face, caused by fragments of glass from his broken goggles. After this crash Blériot abandoned the aircraft, concentrating on his next machine.

This, the Blériot VII, was a monoplane with tail surfaces arranged in what has become, apart from its use of differential elevators movement for lateral control, the modern conventional layout. This aircraft, which first flew on 16 November 1907, has been recognised as the first successful monoplane. On 6 December Blériot managed two flights of over 500 metres, including a successful U-turn. This was the most impressive achievement to date of any of the French pioneer aviators, causing Patrick Alexander to write to Major Baden Baden-Powell, president of the Royal Aeronautical Society, &quot;I got back from Paris last night. I think Blériot with his new machine is leading the way&quot;. Two more successful flights were made on 18 December, but the undercarriage collapsed after the second flight; the aircraft overturned and was wrecked.

Blériot&#x27;s next aircraft, the Blériot VIII was shown to the press in February 1908. Although it was the first to use of a successful combination of hand/arm-operated joystick and foot-operated rudder control, this was a failure in its first form. After modifications, it proved successful, and on 31 October 1908 he succeeded in making a cross-country flight, making a round trip from Toury to Arteny and back, a total distance of . This was not the first cross-country flight by a narrow margin, since Henri Farman had flown from Bouy to Rheims the preceding day. Four days later, the aircraft was destroyed in a taxiing accident.

Three of his aircraft were displayed at the first Paris Aero Salon, held at the end of December: the Blériot IX monoplane; the Blériot X, a three-seat pusher biplane; and the Blériot XI, which went on to be his most successful model. The first two of the designs, which used Antoinette engines, never flew, possibly because at this time, Blériot severed his connection with the Antoinette company because the company had begun to design and construct aircraft as well as engines, presenting Blériot with a conflict of interests. The Type XI was initially powered by a REP engine and was first flown with this engine on 18 January 1909, but although the aircraft flew well, after a very short time in the air, the engine began to overheat, leading Blériot to get in touch with Alessandro Anzani, who had developed a successful motorcycle engine and had subsequently entered the aero-engine market. Importantly, Anzani was associated with Lucien Chauvière, who had designed a sophisticated laminated walnut propeller. The combination of a reliable engine and an efficient propeller contributed greatly to the success of the Type XI.

This was shortly followed by the Blériot XII, a high-wing two-seater monoplane first flown on 21 May, and for a while Blériot concentrated on flying this machine, flying it with a passenger on 2 July, and on 12 July making the world&#x27;s first flight with two passengers, one of whom was Santos Dumont. A few days later the crankshaft of the E.N.V. engine broke, and Blériot resumed trials of the Type XI. On 25 June he made a flight lasting 15 minutes and 30 seconds, his longest to date, and the following day increased this personal record to over 36 minutes. At the end of July he took part in an aviation meet at Douai, where he made a flight lasting over 47 minutes in the Type XII on 3 July: the following day he flew the Type XI for 50 minutes at another meet at Juvisy, and on 13 July, he made a cross-country flight of from Etampes to Orléans. Blériot&#x27;s determination is shown by the fact that during the flight at Douai made on 2 July part of the asbestos insulation worked loose from the exhaust pipe after 15 minutes in the air. After half an hour, one of his shoes had been burnt through and he was in considerable pain, but nevertheless continued his flight until engine failure ended the flight. Blériot suffered third-degree burns, and his injuries took over two months to heal.

On 16 June 1909, Blériot and Voisin were jointly awarded the Prix Osiris, awarded by the Institut de France every three years to the Frenchman who had made the greatest contribution to science. Three days later, on 19 June, he informed the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; of his intention to make an attempt to win the thousand-pound prize offered by the paper for a successful crossing of the English Channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft.

== 1909 Channel crossing ==

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; prize was first announced in October 1908, with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year. When 1908 passed with no serious attempt being made, the offer was renewed for the year of 1909, with the prize money doubled to £1,000. Like some of the other prizes offered, it was widely seen as nothing more than a way to gain cheap publicity for the paper: the Paris newspaper &quot;Le Matin&quot; commenting that there was no chance of the prize being won.

The English Channel had been crossed many times by balloon, beginning with Jean-Pierre Blanchard and John Jeffries&#x27;s crossing in 1785.

Blériot, who intended to fly across the Channel in his Type XI monoplane, had three rivals for the prize, the most serious being Hubert Latham, a French national of English extraction flying an Antoinette IV monoplane. He was favoured by both the United Kingdom and France to win. The others were Charles de Lambert, a Russian aristocrat with French ancestry, and one of Wilbur Wright&#x27;s pupils, and Arthur Seymour, an Englishman who reputedly owned a Voisin biplane. De Lambert got as far as establishing a base at Wissant, near Calais, but Seymour did nothing beyond submitting his entry to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Lord Northcliffe, who had befriended Wilbur Wright during his sensational 1908 public demonstrations in France, had offered the prize hoping that Wilbur would win. Wilbur wanted to make an attempt and cabled brother Orville in the United States. Orville, then recuperating from serious injuries sustained in a crash, replied telling him not to make the Channel attempt until he could come to France and assist. Also Wilbur had already amassed a fortune in prize money for altitude and duration flights and had secured sales contracts for the Wright Flyer with the French, Italians, British and Germans; his tour in Europe was essentially complete by the summer of 1909. Both brothers saw the Channel reward of only a thousand pounds as insignificant considering the dangers of the flight.

Latham arrived in Calais in early July, and set up his base at Sangatte in the semi-derelict buildings which had been constructed for an 1881 attempt to dig a tunnel under the Channel. The event was the subject of great public interest; it was reported that there were 10,000 visitors at Calais and a similar crowd at Dover. The Marconi Company set up a special radio link for the occasion, with one station on Cap Blanc Nez near Sangatte and the other on the roof of the Lord Warden Hotel in Dover. The crowds were in for a wait: the weather was windy, and Latham did not make an attempt until 19 July, but from his destination his aircraft developed engine trouble and was forced to make the world&#x27;s first landing of an aircraft on the sea. Latham was rescued by the French destroyer &quot;Harpon&quot; and taken back to France, where he was met by the news that Blériot had entered the competition. Blériot, accompanied by two mechanics and his friend Alfred Leblanc, arrived in Calais on Wednesday 21 July and set up their base at a farm near the beach at Les Baraques, between Calais and Sangatte. The following day a replacement aircraft for Latham was delivered from the Antoinette factory. The wind was too strong for an attempted crossing on Friday and Saturday, but on Saturday evening it began to drop, raising hopes in both camps.

Leblanc went to bed at around midnight but was too keyed up to sleep well; at two o&#x27;clock, he was up, and judging that the weather was ideal woke Blériot who, unusually, was pessimistic and had to be persuaded to eat breakfast. His spirits revived, however, and by half past three, his wife Alice had boarded the destroyer &quot;Escopette&quot;, which was to escort the flight.

At 4:15 am, 25 July, watched by an excited crowd, Blériot made a short trial flight in his Type XI, and then, on a signal that the sun had risen (the competition rules required a flight between sunrise and sunset), he took off at 4:41 to attempt the crossing. Flying at approximately and an altitude of about 250 ft (76 m), he set off across the Channel. Not having a compass, Blériot took his course from the &quot;Escopette&quot;, which was heading for Dover, but he soon overtook the ship. The visibility deteriorated, and he later said, &quot;for more than 10 minutes I was alone, isolated, lost in the midst of the immense sea, and I did not see anything on the horizon or a single ship&quot;. The grey line of the English coast, however, came into sight on his left; the wind had increased, and had blown him to the east of his intended course. Altering course, he followed the line of the coast about a mile offshore until he spotted Charles Fontaine, the correspondent from &quot;Le Matin&quot; waving a large Tricolour as a signal. Unlike Latham, Blériot had not visited Dover to find a suitable spot to land, and the choice had been made by Fontaine, who had selected a patch of gently sloping land called Northfall Meadow, close to Dover Castle, on top of the cliffs. Once over land, Blériot circled twice to lose height, and cut his engine at an altitude of about , making a heavy &quot;pancake&quot; landing due to the gusty wind conditions; the undercarriage was damaged and one blade of the propeller was shattered, but Blériot was unhurt. The flight had taken 36 minutes and 30 seconds.

News of his departure had been sent by radio to Dover, but it was generally expected that he would attempt to land on the beach to the west of the town. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; correspondent, realising that Blériot had landed near the castle, set off at speed in a motor car and took Blériot to the harbour, where he was reunited with his wife. The couple, surrounded by a cheering crowd and photographers, were then taken to the Lord Warden Hotel at the foot of the Admiralty Pier; Blériot had become a celebrity.

The &quot;Blériot Memorial&quot;, the outline of the aircraft laid out in granite setts in the turf (funded by oil manufacturer Alexander Duckham), marks his landing spot above the cliffs near Dover Castle. .

The aircraft which was used in the crossing is now preserved in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris.

==Later life==
Blériot&#x27;s success brought about an immediate transformation of the status of &quot;Recherches Aéronautiques Louis Blériot.&quot; By the time of the Channel flight, he had spent at least 780,000 francs on his aviation experiments. (To put this figure into context, one of Blériot&#x27;s skilled mechanics was paid 250 francs a month.) Now this investment began to pay off: orders for copies of the Type XI quickly came, and by the end of the year, orders for over 100 aircraft had been received, each selling for 10,000 francs.

At the end of August, Blériot was one of the flyers at the Grande Semaine d&#x27;Aviation held at Reims, where he was narrowly beaten by Glenn Curtiss in the first Gordon Bennett Trophy. Blériot did, however, succeed in winning the prize for the fastest lap of the circuit, establishing a new world speed record for aircraft.

Blériot followed his flights at Reims with appearances at other aviation meetings in Brescia, Budapest, Bucharest in 1909 (making the first airplane flights in both Hungary and Romania). Up to this time he had had great good luck in walking away from accidents that had destroyed the aircraft, but his luck deserted him in December 1909 at an aviation meeting in Istanbul. Flying in gusty conditions to placate an impatient and restive crowd, he crashed on top of a house, breaking several ribs and suffering internal injuries: he was hospitalized for three weeks.

Between 1909 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Blériot produced about 900 aircraft, most of them variations of the Type XI model. Blériot monoplanes and Voisin-type biplanes, with the latter&#x27;s Farman derivatives dominated the pre-war aviation market. There were concerns about the safety of monoplanes in general, both in France and the UK. The French government grounded all monoplanes in the French Army from February 1912 after accidents to four Blériots, but lifted it after trials in May supported Blériot&#x27;s analysis of the problem and led to a strengthening of the landing wires. The brief but influential ban on the use of monoplanes by the Military Wing (though not the Naval Wing) in the UK was triggered by accidents to other manufacturer&#x27;s aircraft; Blériots were not involved.

Along with five other European aircraft builders, from 1910, Blériot was involved in a five-year legal struggle with the Wright Brothers over the latter&#x27;s wing warping patents. The Wrights&#x27; claim was dismissed in the French and the German courts.

From 1913 or earlier, Blériot&#x27;s aviation activities were handled by Blériot Aéronautique, based at Suresnes, which continued to design and produce aircraft up to the nationalisation of most of the French aircraft industry in 1937, when it was absorbed into SNCASO.

In 1913, a consortium led by Blériot bought the Société pour les Appareils Deperdussin aircraft manufacturer and he became the president of the company in 1914. He renamed it the Société Pour L&#x27;Aviation et ses Dérivés (SPAD); this company produced World War I fighter aircraft such as the SPAD S.XIII.
Before World War I, Blériot had opened British flying schools at Brooklands, in Surrey and at Hendon Aerodrome. Realising that a British company would have more chance to sell his models to the British government, in 1915, he set up the Blériot Manufacturing Aircraft Company Ltd. The hoped for orders did not follow, as the Blériot design was seen as outdated. Following an unresolved conflict over control of the company, it was wound up on 24 July 1916. Even before the closure of this company Blériot was planning a new venture in the UK. Initially named Blériot and SPAD Ltd and based in Addlestone, it became the Air Navigation and Engineering Company (ANEC) in May 1918. ANEC survived in a difficult aviation climate until late 1926, producing Blériot-Whippet cars, the Blériot 500cc motorcycle, as well as several light aircraft.

In 1927, Blériot, long retired from flying, was present to welcome Charles Lindbergh when he landed at Le Bourget field completing his transatlantic flight. The two men, separated in age by 30 years, had each made history by crossing significant bodies of water, and shared a photo opportunity in Paris.

In 1934, Blériot visited Newark Airport in New Jersey and predicted commercial overseas flights by 1938.

==Death==

Blériot remained active in the aviation business until his death on 1 August 1936 in Paris due to a heart attack. After a funeral with full military honours at Les Invalides he was buried in the Cimetière des Gonards in Versailles.
==Legacy==
In 1930, Blériot himself instituted the &quot;Blériot Trophy&quot;, a one-time award which would be awarded to the first aircrew to sustain an average speed of over 2,000 kilometers per hour (1,242.742 miles per hour) over one half of an hour, an extremely ambitious and prophetic target in an era when the fastest aircraft were just breaking the 200 mph mark. The award was finally presented slightly more than three decades later by Alice Védères Blériot, widow of Louis Blériot, at Paris, France, 27 May 1961, to the crew of the United States Air Force Convair B-58A jet bomber, AF serial number 59-2451, &quot;Firefly&quot;, crewed by Aircraft Commander Major Elmer E. Murphy, Navigator Major Eugene Moses, and Defensive Systems Officer First Lieutenant David F. Dickerson who on 10 May 1961, sustained an average speed of 2,095 kmph (1,302.07 mph) over 30 minutes and 43 seconds, covering a ground track of 1,077.3 kilometers (669.4 miles). This same crew and aircraft went on to set a number of other speed records before being lost in an accident shortly after takeoff from Paris, not long after setting yet another speed record, winning the Harmon Trophy for a record-setting flight between New York City and Paris, France. This flight was 3,626.46 miles in 3 hours, 19 minutes, 58 seconds, for an average of 1,089.36 mph. The Blériot Trophy winning crew took over the aircraft for the return flight, but were all killed when the pilot lost control shortly after takeoff from the Paris Air Show during some attempted impromptu aerobatics.
The Blériot Trophy is a statuette in the classical style sculpted of polished white and black marble stone, depicting a nude male figure of black marble emerging from stylized white marble clouds resembling female forms. It is now on permanent display at the McDermott Library of the United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA.

In 1936 the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale established the &quot;Louis Blériot medal&quot; in his honor. The medal may be awarded up to three times a year to record setters in speed, altitude and distance categories in light aircraft, and is still being awarded.

In 1967 Blériot was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

On 25 July 2009, the centenary of the original Channel crossing, Frenchman Edmond Salis took off from Blériot Beach in a replica of Bleriot&#x27;s aircraft. He landed successfully in Kent at the Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School.

<doc id="162796" wikidata="Q2531690" url="?curid=162796" title="Olive Oyl">
<text>Olive Oyl is a cartoon character created by E. C. Segar in 1919 for his comic strip &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot;. The strip was later renamed &quot;Popeye&quot; after the sailor character that became the most popular member of the cast; however, Olive Oyl was a main character for a decade before Popeye&#x27;s 1929 appearance.

==Fictional character biography==

In the strip as written by Segar, Olive is a scrappy, headstrong young woman (her age varying between her late teens and 26) visually characterized by her exaggeratedly slim build (evolving from its previous more realistically proportioned form by the late 1920s) and her long black hair (usually presented as rolled in a neat bun, like her mother&#x27;s). She is the youngest sibling of Castor Oyl and Crude Oyl. 
Debuting on December 19, 1919, Olive was the childhood sweetheart and more-or-less fiancée of original &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; protagonist Harold Hamgravy (Ham Gravy), a &quot;lounge lizard&quot; or slacker type who did as little work as possible and was always borrowing money. His attraction to other women—particularly if they were rich—naturally incensed Olive, leading her to (in a storyline run in mid-1928) succumb to a fit of &quot;lunaphobia&quot; (a kind of angry madness) over one of his amours; when she recovered, she continued to pretend to have the disorder to win him back. She was not immune to flattery from other men, but remained committed to Hamgravy on-and-off until Popeye&#x27;s appearance. Olive and Popeye initially greeted each other with animosity (her first words to him being &quot;take your hooks offa me or I&#x27;ll lay ya in a scupper&quot;), leading them to fight bitterly for weeks before finally realizing that they had feelings for each other. Following a series of Sunday strips run in March 1930, Popeye would definitively supersede Ham as Olive&#x27;s lover, a position he occupies within the comic into the present; Ham had largely vanished from the daily strip six months earlier, although Popeye and Olive&#x27;s relationship would nonetheless not be emphasized within the daily strip&#x27;s continuity until the height of the Clint Gore story arc in January 1931.

The version of Olive Oyl most widely familiar is the coyer and more nervous version from the theatrical animated cartoons created by Fleischer Studios and continued by Famous Studios. Unlike most modern damsels in distress, Olive Oyl is tall and skinny, with tightly wound hair and enormous feet (the latter sometimes used to comedic effect). Popeye&#x27;s comment about her measurements is that she is a perfect 57... 19-19-19.

In the films and later television cartoons, Olive Oyl is usually Popeye&#x27;s girlfriend, although she could be extremely fickle, depending on who could woo her the best or had the flashier possessions, and she was prone to become angry with Popeye over seemingly minor issues. She constantly gets kidnapped by Bluto (aka Brutus), who is Popeye&#x27;s arch-rival for her affections; when she gets angry with Popeye for whatever goes wrong, it&#x27;s usually as a result of Bluto&#x27;s trickery, but Popeye always rescues her and wins back her affection in the process.

In the cartoons, she helps take care of a baby named Swee&#x27;Pea or she usually asks Popeye to take care of him if she&#x27;s too busy; it&#x27;s unknown if Swee&#x27;Pea is Olive Oyl&#x27;s biological or adopted son. In the comics, Swee&#x27;Pea is a foundling under Popeye&#x27;s care. Later sources (mostly in the cartoon series) say that Swee&#x27;Pea is Olive Oyl&#x27;s cousin or nephew that she has to take care of from time to time.

Like Popeye, there are times where Olive gains superhuman strength from eating spinach.

==History of the character==
Olive Oyl is named after olive oil, used commonly in cooking or in salads. Segar&#x27;s newspaper strips also featured a number of her relatives named after other oils, including her brother, Castor Oyl, their mother, Nana Oyl (after &quot;banana oil&quot;, a mild slang phrase of the time used in the same way as &quot;horsefeathers&quot;, i.e. &quot;nonsense&quot;), their father, Cole Oyl, and Castor&#x27;s estranged wife, Cylinda Oyl; more recently, Olive&#x27;s nieces Diesel Oyl and Violet Oyl have appeared in the cartoons. Also among Olive&#x27;s family are her two uncles, Otto (Auto) Oyl and intrepid explorer Lubry Kent Oyl. Lubry Kent&#x27;s gift to Castor and Olive, a lucky Whiffle Hen, led them into the adventure where they met Popeye. When Bobby London took over the strip from 1986 to 1992, he added the sultry blonde Sutra Oyl, Olive&#x27;s cousin, and Standard Oyl, a distant relative who was an extremely wealthy corporate magnate.

==Portrayals==
The first two &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons, &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; (1933) and &quot;I Yam What I Yam&quot; (1933), featured Bonnie Poe as the voice of Olive Oyl. She was thereafter voiced by character actress Mae Questel (who also voiced Betty Boop and other characters). Questel styled Olive&#x27;s voice and delivery after those of actress ZaSu Pitts.

In 1938, Margie Hines took over as the voice of Olive Oyl, starting with the cartoon &quot;Bulldozing the Bull&quot;. Questel returned as her voice in 1944, starting with the cartoon &quot;The Anvil Chorus Girl&quot;. Questel would remain so until after the King Features Syndicate made-for-TV &quot;Popeye&quot; shorts in 1960.

Marilyn Schreffler became the new voice of Olive when Hanna-Barbera obtained the rights to produce made-for-television &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons for &quot;The All-New Popeye Hour&quot; in 1978. Schreffler also voiced Olive in &quot;Popeye and Son&quot;. Questel auditioned to reprise her role, but was rejected in favor of Schreffler. Despite being officially replaced by Schreffler, Questel later returned to voice Olive Oyl for a 1983 commercial promoting the &quot;Popeye&quot; video game.

In the 1980 musical live-action feature film &quot;Popeye&quot;, Olive is portrayed by Shelley Duvall opposite co-star Robin Williams as her lover Popeye. In &quot;Popeye&#x27;s Voyage: The Quest for Pappy&quot;, she was voiced by Tabitha St. Germain.

==Appearance==
In her Famous Studios appearance, Olive is given more hair, smaller feet, wider eyes, a more feminine face, a tomboyish streak and a slightly less silly personality. She has black hair with a red bow. She wears a red shirt with short sleeves, black skirt with a red line on the bottom and black pumps. In later animated cartoons from King Features and Hanna-Barbera, while they would occasionally retain aspects of her Famous Studios incarnation, such as her hairstyles, Olive generally reverted to her original enormous feet, pinned-back-with-a-bun hairdo, tall flat brown boots and white socks.

==Personality==
* Olive Oyl is absent-minded, sweet, flirtatious, short-tempered, romantic, headstrong, foolish, shallow, pompous, sassy, inattentive, fickle, demanding, and selfish. She is usually depicted as a stereotypical &quot;damsel-in-distress&quot; character and often blames others for her own mistakes when confronted.
* She frequently says &quot;Oh, dear!&quot; in a way that resembles film actress ZaSu Pitts.

==Other appearances==
* In the 1980 live-action film directed by Robert Altman, Olive Oyl is played by actress Shelley Duvall. Shelley Duvall has mentioned that she was teased in school as Olive Oyl because of her physical resemblance to the character.

* Olive Oyl made a non-speaking cameo in the &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; episode &quot;Droopy Botox&quot;.
* In 1997–1998, Olive Oyl appeared in the video games &quot;Popeye and the Quest For the Woolly Mammoth&quot;, &quot;Popeye: The Rescue&quot; and &quot;Popeye and the Sunken Treasure&quot;, voiced by Cheryl Chase.
* In 2006, King Features produced both a radio spot and industrial for the United States Power Squadrons featuring Robyn Gryphe as Olive and Allen Enlow as Popeye.
* Olive Oyl (along with Popeye, Bluto, and Wimpy) was going to have a cameo in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but the rights to the characters could not be obtained.
* In 2002, Olive Oyl appeared in the video game &quot;Slots from Bally Gaming&quot;, voiced by Lani Minella.
* In July 2007, a live-animation TV commercial starring Olive Oyl aired as part of an advertising campaign for Campbell Soup Company&#x27;s Prego sauces. Olive&#x27;s ad is one in a series of five different ads for Prego, which features Spice Girl Emma Bunton (&quot;Baby Spice&quot;), Olympic Silver Medalist Lea Ann Parsley, an average American couple named Rosemary and Herb and an Englishman named Basil. In each 15-second commercial, the &quot;flavorful&quot; characters wonder aloud about what spice to add to their simmering pot of sauce. She was voiced by Diane Michelle.
* Olive Oyl appeared in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episodes &quot;The Sack&quot; and &quot;Squaw Bury Shortcake&quot;, voiced by Kelly Hu.
* Lil Wayne mentions Olive Oyl in the song &quot;I&#x27;m On One&quot;.

* In &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, Daryl Dixon calls Lori Grimes &quot;Olive Oyl&quot;.
* In the comic strip &quot;Bizarro&quot;, the image of Olive Oyl (or occasionally the abbreviation &quot;O2&quot;) began appearing as one of the hidden symbols in the artwork in May 2017.

==Parodies==
In &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; No. 21 (1951), a parody of Olive called &quot;Mazola Oil&quot; appeared in &quot;Poopeye&quot;. Mazola supplies Poopeye with various spinach recipes to help Poopeye defeat other comic strip characters such as &quot;Mammy Jokeum&quot; (a parody of &quot;Mammy Yokum&quot; from Li&#x27;l Abner), &quot;Melvin of the Apes&quot; (a parody of Tarzan) and &quot;Superduperman&quot; (a parody of Superman). The story was reprinted in the paperback &quot;MAD Strikes Back&quot; (1962), which was later reprinted in a 50th Anniversary Edition (iBooks, Inc., New York, ).

<text>The principle of individuation, or , describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinct from other things.

The concept appears in numerous fields and is encountered in works of Leibniz, Carl Jung, Gunther Anders, Gilbert Simondon, Bernard Stiegler, Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer, David Bohm, Henri Bergson, Gilles Deleuze, and Manuel DeLanda.

==Usage==
The word &quot;individuation&quot; occurs with different meanings and connotations in different fields.

===In philosophy===

Philosophically, &quot;individuation&quot; expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that &quot;is not something else&quot;. This includes how an individual person is held to be different from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons. By the seventeenth century, philosophers began to associate the question of individuation or what brings about individuality at any one time with the question of identity or what constitutes sameness at different points in time.

===In Jungian psychology===

In analytical psychology, individuation is the process by which the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated unconscious – seen as a developmental psychic process during which innate elements of personality, the components of the immature psyche, and the experiences of the person&#x27;s life become, if the process is more or less successful, integrated over time into a well-functioning whole. Other psychoanalytic theorists describe it as the stage where an individual transcends group attachment and narcissistic self-absorption.

===In the news industry===
The news industry has begun using the term &quot;individuation&quot; to denote new printing and on-line technologies that permit mass customization of the contents of a newspaper, a magazine, a broadcast program, or a website so that its contents match each user&#x27;s unique interests. This differs from the traditional mass-media practice of producing the same contents for all readers, viewers, listeners, or on-line users.

Communications theorist Marshall McLuhan alluded to this trend when discussing the future of printed books in an electronically interconnected world in the 1970s and 1980s.

===In privacy and data protection law===
From around 2016, coinciding with increased government regulation of the collection and handling of personal data, most notably the GDPR in EU Law, individuation has been used to describe the ‘singling out’ of a person from a crowd – a threat to privacy, autonomy and dignity. 
Most data protection and privacy laws turn on the identifiability of an individual as the threshold criterion for when data subjects will need legal protection. However, privacy advocates argue privacy harms can also arise from the ability to disambiguate or ‘single out’ a person. Doing so enables the person, at an individual level, to be tracked, profiled, targeted, contacted, or subject to a decision or action which impacts them - even if their civil or legal ‘identity’ is not known (or knowable). 

In some jurisdictions the wording of the statute already &quot;includes&quot; the concept of individuation. In other jurisdictions regulatory guidance has suggested that the concept of &#x27;identification&#x27; includes individuation - i.e., the process by which an individual can be &#x27;singled out&#x27; or distinguished from all other members of a group. 

However, where privacy and data protection statutes use only the word ‘identification’ or ‘identifiability’, different court decisions mean that there is not necessarily a consensus about whether the legal concept of identification already encompasses individuation or not.

Rapid advances in technologies including artificial intelligence, and video surveillance coupled with facial recognition systems have now altered the digital environment to such an extent that ‘not identifiable by name’ is no longer an effective proxy for ‘will suffer no privacy harm’. Many data protection laws may require redrafting to give adequate protection to privacy interests, by explicitly regulating individuation as well as identification of individual people.

===In physics===
Two quantum entangled particles cannot be understood independently. Two or more states in quantum superposition, e.g., as in Schrödinger&#x27;s cat being simultaneously dead and alive, is mathematically not the same as assuming the cat is in an individual alive state with 50% probability. The Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle says that complementary variables, such as position and momentum, cannot both be precisely known – in some sense, they are not individual variables. A &quot;natural criterion of individuality&quot; has been suggested.

==Arthur Schopenhauer==

For Schopenhauer, the &quot;principium individuationis&quot; is constituted of time and space, being the ground of multiplicity. In his view, the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different, with each of the two states having its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other.

This view influenced Albert Einstein. Schrödinger put the Schopenhaurian label on a folder of papers in his files “Collection of Thoughts on the physical Principium individuationis.”

==Carl Jung==

According to Jungian psychology, individuation () is a process of psychological integration. &quot;In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated [from other human beings]; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology.&quot;

Individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and collective unconscious are brought into consciousness (e.g., by means of dreams, active imagination, or free association) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process that is necessary for the integration of the psyche. Individuation has a holistic healing effect on the person, both mentally and physically.

In addition to Jung&#x27;s theory of complexes, his theory of the individuation process forms conceptions of an unconscious filled with mythic images, a non-sexual libido, the general types of extraversion and introversion, the compensatory and prospective functions of dreams, and the synthetic and constructive approaches to fantasy formation and utilization.

&quot;The symbols of the individuation process . . . mark its stages like milestones, prominent among them for Jungians being the shadow, the wise old man . . . and lastly the anima in man and the animus in woman.&quot; Thus, &quot;There is often a movement from dealing with the persona at the start . . . to the ego at the second stage, to the shadow as the third stage, to the anima or animus, to the Self as the final stage. Some would interpose the Wise Old Man and the Wise Old Woman as spiritual archetypes coming before the final step of the Self.&quot;

&quot;The most vital urge in every being, the urge to self-realize, is the motivating force behind the individuation process. With the internal compass of our very nature set toward self-realization, the thrust to become who and what we are derives its power from the instincts. On taking up the study of alchemy, Jung realized his long-held desire to find a body of work expressive of the psychological processes involved in the overarching process of individuation.&quot;

==Gilbert Simondon==

In &quot;L&#x27;individuation psychique et collective&quot;, Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending ontological process of individuation.

Simondon also conceived of &quot;pre-individual fields&quot; which make individuation possible. Individuation is an ever-incomplete process, always leaving a &quot;pre-individual&quot; left over, which makes possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject, which individuate themselves concurrently. Like Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Simondon believed that the individuation of being cannot be grasped except by a correlated parallel and reciprocal individuation of knowledge.

==Bernard Stiegler==

The philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of Gilbert Simondon on individuation and also upon similar ideas in Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. During a talk given at the Tate Modern art gallery in 2004, Stiegler summarized his understanding of individuation. The essential points are the following:

*The &quot;I&quot;, as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to &quot;we&quot;, which is a collective individual. The &quot;I&quot; is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of &quot;I&quot; ’s acknowledge each other’s existence.
*This inheritance is an adoption, in that I can very well, as the French grandson of a German immigrant, recognize myself in a past which was not the past of my ancestors but which I can make my own. This process of adoption is thus structurally factual.
*The &quot;I&quot; is essentially a process, not a state, and this process is an in-dividuation — it is a process of psychic individuation. It is the tendency to &quot;become one&quot;, that is, to become indivisible.
*This tendency never accomplishes itself because it runs into a counter-tendency with which it forms a metastable equilibrium. (It must be pointed out how closely this conception of the dynamic of individuation is to the Freudian theory of drives and to the thinking of Nietzsche and Empedocles.)
*The &quot;we&quot; is also such a process (the process of collective individuation). The individuation of the &quot;I&quot; is always inscribed in that of the &quot;we&quot;, whereas the individuation of the &quot;we&quot; takes place only through the individuations, polemical in nature, of the &quot;I&quot; ’s which constitute it.
*That which links the individuations of the &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;we&quot; is a pre-individual system possessing positive conditions of effectiveness that belong to what Stiegler calls retentional apparatuses. These retentional apparatuses arise from a technical system which is the condition of the encounter of the &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;we&quot; — the individuation of the &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;we&quot; is, in this respect, also the individuation of the technical system.
*The technical system is an apparatus which has a specific role wherein all objects are inserted — a technical object exists only insofar as it is disposed within such an apparatus with other technical objects (this is what Gilbert Simondon calls the technical group).
*The technical system is also that which founds the possibility of the constitution of retentional apparatuses, springing from the processes of grammatization growing out of the process of individuation of the technical system. And these retentional apparatuses are the basis for the dispositions between the individuation of the &quot;I&quot; and the individuation of the &quot;we&quot; in a single process of psychic, collective, and technical individuation composed of three branches, each branching out into process groups.
*This process of triple individuation is itself inscribed within a vital individuation which must be apprehended as:
**the vital individuation of natural organs
**the technological individuation of artificial organs
**and the psycho-social individuation of organizations linking them together
*In the process of individuation, wherein knowledge as such emerges, there are individuations of mnemo-technological subsystems which overdetermine, &quot;qua&quot; specific organizations of what Stiegler calls tertiary retentions, the organization, transmission, and elaboration of knowledge stemming from the experience of the sensible.

<doc id="162798" wikidata="Q2519837" url="?curid=162798" title="Bluto">
<text>Bluto, at times known as Brutus, is a cartoon and comics character created in 1932 by Elzie Crisler Segar as a one-time character, named &quot;Bluto the Terrible&quot;, in his &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; comic strip (later renamed &quot;Popeye&quot;). Bluto made his first appearance on September 12 of that year. Fleischer Studios adapted him the next year (1933) to be the main antagonist of their theatrical &quot;Popeye&quot; animated cartoon series.

==Character==
Bluto is a cruel, bearded, muscular ruffian who serves as Popeye&#x27;s nemesis and archrival for the love of Olive Oyl. He usually uses brute force and/or trickery to accomplish his various goals. His voice is very loud, harsh and deep, with an incomprehensible bear-like growl between words and sentences. This voice, as well as the dark beard, crooked teeth, and bulk, was similar to that of the villain Red Flack, well known at the time, played by Tyrone Power Sr. in the 1930 film, &quot;The Big Trail&quot;.

Bluto, like Popeye, is enamored of Olive Oyl, and he often attempts to kidnap her. However, with the help of some spinach, Popeye usually ends up defeating him. Some cartoons portray Popeye and Bluto as Navy buddies, although in these episodes Bluto usually turns on Popeye when an object of interest (usually Olive) is put between them.

Bluto&#x27;s strength is portrayed inconsistently. In some episodes, he is weaker than Popeye and resorts to underhanded trickery to accomplish his goals. At other times, Popeye stands no chance against Bluto in a fight until he eats his spinach. In yet other cartoons, the two characters are closely matched, with Bluto eventually gaining the upper hand before Popeye eats his spinach and defeats Bluto. In some shorts, Bluto is a match for Popeye even after he has eaten his spinach. Bluto is sometimes portrayed as having a . He has, on occasion, been knocked out by Olive Oyl and even by Popeye&#x27;s infant ward Swee&#x27;Pea. On rare occasions, Bluto tries to sabotage Popeye before confronting him, such as when he tried to thwart his own defeat by using a forklift to steal Popeye&#x27;s store of spinach cans and disposing of them in a garbage dump. In one case, Popeye forces a defeated Bluto to consume spinach, after which Bluto easily beats up Popeye, resulting in Olive pitying him and choosing him over Bluto.
In most cases, the name &quot;Bluto&quot; is used as a first name. In cartoons where Bluto portrays alternate characters, or &quot;roles,&quot; the name can be used as a surname, as with lumberjack &quot;Pierre Bluto&quot; in the cartoon &quot;Axe Me Another&quot; and etiquette teacher &quot;Professor Bluteau&quot; in &quot;Learn Polikeness&quot;.

==Bluto vs. Brutus==
After the theatrical &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoon series ceased production in 1957, Bluto&#x27;s name was changed to Brutus because at the time it was believed by King Features that Paramount Pictures, distributors of the Fleischer Studios (later Famous Studios) cartoons, owned the rights to the name &quot;Bluto&quot;. King Features actually owned the name, as Bluto had been originally created for the comic strip. Due to a lack of thorough research, King Features failed to realize this and reinvented him as Brutus to avoid potential copyright problems. &quot;Brutus&quot; (often pronounced &quot;Brutusk&quot; by Popeye) appears in the 1960–62 &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; television cartoons with his physical appearance changed, making him obese rather than muscular. He normally sported a blue shirt and brown pants.

The character reverted to Bluto for Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The All-New Popeye Hour&quot; (1978–83) and the 1980 live-action &quot;Popeye&quot; movie, as well as the 1987 &quot;Popeye and Son&quot; series also by Hanna-Barbera. The character was also named Bluto in the 2004 movie &quot;Popeye&#x27;s Voyage: The Quest for Pappy&quot;.

It was long accepted that Bluto and Brutus were one and the same. However, a 1988 &quot;Popeye&quot; comic book, published by Ocean Comics, presented the two characters as twin brothers. The &quot;Popeye&quot; comic strip, at the time written and drawn by Hy Eisman, generally featured only Brutus, but added Bluto as Brutus&#x27; twin brother in several 2008 and 2009 strips. The two continue to appear as brothers in the more recent strips by Randy Milholland.

==Voice==
In the Paramount theatrical cartoons, Bluto was voiced by a number of actors, including William Pennell, Gus Wickie, Jackson Beck (who took over the role in 1944), Pinto Colvig, Tedd Pierce, Lee Royce, Dave Barry, and Jack Mercer. Beck also supplied the voice for Brutus in the early 1960s. In the 1980 live-action movie, he was portrayed by Paul L. Smith. In &quot;The All-New Popeye Hour&quot; and &quot;Popeye and Son&quot;, he was voiced by Allan Melvin. In &quot;Popeye&#x27;s Voyage: The Quest for Pappy&quot;, he was voiced by Garry Chalk.

==Other characters==
In the animated cartoons Popeye&#x27;s foe is almost always Bluto functioning in some capacity (fellow sailor, generic thug, carnival hypnotist, sheik, lecherous instructor, etc.). However, in the Famous-era shorts there have also been &quot;original&quot; one-time characters with Bluto-like personalities and mannerisms such as the blond, beardless lifeguard in &quot;Beach Peach&quot;. Jackson Beck voiced these characters using the same voice. 

In the comics, Bluto and Brutus have a brother Bruto who is older than Brutus.

<doc id="162799" wikidata="Q4634843" url="?curid=162799" title="31st Infantry Regiment (United States)">
<text>The 31st Infantry Regiment (&quot;Polar Bears&quot;) of the United States Army was formed on 13 August 1916, and was part of USAFFE&#x27;s Philippine Division during World War II. The unit is rare in that it was formed and has spent most of its life on non-American soil.

The regiment is the third to bear the designation; the first was formed for the War of 1812 and disbanded in 1815. The second was created from the 3rd Battalion of the 13th Infantry on 28 July 1866, in the reorganization of the U.S. Army following the American Civil War. The second organization to be called the 31st Infantry was consolidated with its sister regiment the 22nd Infantry (also formed out of the 13th) in an 1869 reorganization. Because the lineage of the previous regiments called the 31st were passed down to their successor units, the current 31st Infantry Regiment does not share their history or honors.

==Organization==
The third organization called the 31st Infantry Regiment was formed at Fort William McKinley, Philippine Islands on 13 August 1916 using cadre from the 8th, 13th, 15th, and 27th Infantry Regiments. The 1st Battalion was formed at Regan Barracks, the 2nd at Camp McGrath, and the 3rd at Fort William McKinley. It bears the distinction of being the first organization created under expansion of the US Army under the National Defense Act of 1916.

==Russian Civil War==
During the Russian Revolution, on 13 August 1918, the 31st moved from Manila&#x27;s tropics to the bitter cold of Siberia as part of the American Expeditionary Force, Siberia. Its mission was to prevent allied war material left on Vladivostok&#x27;s docks from being looted. The 31st moved from Fort William McKinley to Manila, and there set sail for Vladivostok, Siberia, arriving on 21 August. The regiment was then broken into various detachments and used to guard the Trans-Siberian railway, as well as 130 km of a branch line leading to the Suchan mines.
For the next 2 years, the 31st and its sister, the 27th Infantry Regiment, fought off bands of Red revolutionaries and White counterrevolutionaries that were plundering the Siberian countryside and trying to gain control of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. They also dissuaded their 40,000 Japanese allies from taking control of Russian territory.

The regiment suffered its first battle casualties on 29 August 1918, in action near Ugolnaya. During the Siberian deployment, 30 men of the 31st Infantry were killed, and some 60 men were wounded in action. In addition, a large number of troops lost limbs due to frostbite. During this deployment, the regiment recommended one Medal of Honor and 15 Distinguished Service Crosses. For its service in Siberia, the 31st Infantry became known as &quot;the Polar Bear regiment&quot;, adopting a silver polar bear as its insignia.

==Interwar period==

Part of the regiment sailed from Vladivostok on the USAT &quot;Crook&quot; in February 1920 and arrived at Manila, Philippine Islands, near the end of the month. The remainder sailed on the USAT &quot;South Bend&quot; on 30 March 1920 and arrived at Fort William McKinley, Philippines, on 16 April 1920. On 16 December 1920, the entire regiment was transferred to the Post of Manila. It was assigned to the Philippine Division on 22 October 1921, and relieved from the division on 26 June 1931.

===China service===

On 1 February 1932, the regiment was ordered to Shanghai, China, arriving on 4 February. There, the unit guarded a section of the International Settlement, during a period of considerable fighting between Japanese and Chinese troops. Reinforcing the 4th Marine Regiment and a predominantly British International Force, the 31st Infantry deployed hastily by sea to protect Shanghai&#x27;s International Settlement. Although adjacent parts of Shanghai were demolished by fierce fighting between Japanese and Chinese troops, the International Settlement remained an island of security. By April, some officers sent for their families from Manila and billeted them at a hotel in the International Settlement. On 1 July 1932, when the crisis passed, the unit sailed for the Philippines on the USAT &quot;Republic&quot;. For their service in Shanghai, they received the Yangtze Service Medal (Marines). The regiment’s mission in the Philippine Department’s defense plan was to deploy to Corregidor and act as the beach defense force for the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays. The regiment was reassigned to the Philippine Division in December 1941.

==World War II==
On 8 December 1941, Japanese planes attacked U.S. military installations in the Philippines. A 31st Infantry sergeant on detail at Camp John Hay in Baguio became the campaign&#x27;s first fatality. After landing in northern and Southern Luzon, the Japanese pushed rapidly toward Manila, routing hastily formed Philippine Army units that had little training and few heavy weapons. The 31st Infantry covered the withdrawal of American and Philippine forces to the Bataan Peninsula. Unfortunately, the peninsula had not been provisioned with food and medicine and no help could come in from the outside after much of the Pacific fleet was destroyed at Pearl Harbor and mid-ocean bases at Guam and Wake Island were lost. &quot;Despite starvation, disease, no supplies, obsolete weapons, and often inoperative ammunition, the peninsula&#x27;s defenders fought the Japanese to a standstill for 4 months, upsetting Japan&#x27;s timetable for Asia&#x27;s conquest&quot;. When Major General King announced he would surrender the Bataan Defense Force on 9 April 1942, the 31st Infantry buried its colors and the cherished Shanghai Bowl to keep them out of enemy hands. Some of the 31st&#x27;s survivors escaped to continue resisting, but most underwent brutal torture and humiliation on the Bataan Death March and nearly three years of captivity. Twenty-nine of the regiment&#x27;s men earned the Distinguished Service Cross and one was recommended for the Medal of Honor, but the entire chain of command died in captivity before the medal recommendation could be formally submitted. Roughly half of the 1600 men of the 31st Infantry who surrendered at Bataan perished while prisoners of the Japanese.

Perhaps of note, the Shanghai Bowl was later recovered due to the efforts of Cpt. Earl R. Short (who had buried it) after his release from a POW camp, and Col. Niederpreum. He returned to Corregidor Island under the orders of Major General Marshall in September 1945 to retrieve the bowl from its hidden location. While he was able to pinpoint the area, others had to continue the excavation until it was located in December 1945. The Bowl and Cups were found a yard and a half from where Cpt. Short had remembered them to be. And so, the trophy and symbol of the 31st Regiment was returned to them.

==Korean War==

In January 1946, General MacArthur restored his former guard of honor to active service at Seoul, Korea, assigning the 31st to the 7th Infantry Division. For the next 2 years the 31st Infantry performed occupation duty in central Korea, facing the Soviet Army across the 38th Parallel. In 1948, the occupation of Korea ended and the regiment moved to the Japanese island of Hokkaido, occupying the land of its former tormentor. When North Korean troops invaded South Korea in the summer of 1950, the 31st Infantry was stripped to cadre strength to reinforce other units being sent to Korea. In September, the regiment was restored to full strength with replacements from the U.S. and Koreans (KATUSA) hastily drafted by their government and shipped to Japan for a few weeks training before returning to their homeland as members of American units. The 31st Infantry returned to Korea as part of MacArthur&#x27;s Inchon invasion force.
In November 1950, the 31st Infantry made its second amphibious invasion of the campaign, landing at Riwŏn, not far from Vladivostok where the 31st had fought just 30 years before. With North Korean resistance shattered, UN troops pushed toward the Yalu River. When Chinese troops swept down from Manchuria, they surrounded a task force led by the 31st Infantry&#x27;s commander, COL Allan MacLean. COL MacLean and his successor, LTC Don C. Faith, were both killed during the ensuing battle. LTC Faith was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his gallant attempt to lead the command to safety. As a result of this action, the regimental flag was captured by the Chinese forces and now displayed in The Military Museum of The Chinese Revolution in Beijing.

COL William J. McCaffrey assumed command of the 31st Infantry as they fought against desperate odds on the east side of the Chosin Reservoir from the night of 27 November until 1 December while the Marines did likewise on the west side. Several hundred 31st Infantry survivors managed to make it across the frozen reservoir to the Marines&#x27; lines the night of 1 December and the next day, and accompanied the Marines in their fighting withdrawal from the Chosin to Hungnam from 1–11 December 1950. Of the task force&#x27;s original complement of nearly 3300 men, only 385 of those who reached Marine lines at Hagaru-ri from the inlet were unwounded. Not one vehicle or piece of heavy equipment made it through. An example of courage shown by unit members is the DSC awarded to Sergeant George H. Paine:

Citation: &quot;The Distinguished Service Cross is awarded to Sergeant George H. Paine, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with Company H, 31st Infantry Regiment, Seventh Infantry Division, on 30 November 1950, near Koto-ri, Korea. He was with the leading element of the Second Battalion moving north to link up with friendly units when the column was attacked by enemy who were entrenched and concentrated on high ground along the route of advance. Sergeant Paine located several enemy positions on a hillside from which automatic-weapons and small-arms were firing. Bravely and without regard for his own personal safety, he advanced alone against these positions, exposing himself to draw their fire from other elements of the column who were regrouping to make an attack. In his advance, he neutralized two enemy automatic weapons, permitting friendly troops to advance without casualties. Joining the attacking troops of the battalion, he assisted in driving the enemy from their positions around the hilltop. During this action Sergeant Paine was mortally wounded while fiercely resisting enemy forces counterattacking in an attempt to retain the hilltop. This counterattack was repulsed with heavy loss of enemy personnel. The courageous actions of Sergeant Paine were an inspiration to his comrades and enabled the battalion to complete its mission.&quot;
- HQ Eighth US Army Korea, General Orders No. 113 (4 March 1951).

The remnants of the regiment was evacuated from North Korea by sea to Pusan. There it rebuilt, retrained, and refitted and was soon back in combat, stopping the Chinese at Chechon, South Korea and participating in the counteroffensive to retake central Korea. Near the Hwacheon Reservoir, two men of the regiment earned the Medal of Honor in some of the war&#x27;s most determined offensive combat. By the summer of 1951, the line stabilized near the war&#x27;s start point along the 38th Parallel. 

31st Infantry&#x27;s 1st Battalion has the distinction of being the first Army battalion to be commanded by an ethnic minority on the battlefield, when COL McCaffrey promoted then MAJ Young-Oak Kim upon his return in August 1951 from injuries sustained during a friendly fire incident when his unit became the first American troops to cross beyond the 38th parallel and thought to be too far north to be friendly during Operation Piledriver.

For the next two years, a seemingly endless series of blows were exchanged across central Korea&#x27;s cold, desolate hills. Names like Old Baldy, Pork Chop Hill, Triangle Hill, and OP Dale are among the war&#x27;s most famous battles, all fought by the 31st Infantry and bought with its blood. By the war&#x27;s end, the 31st Infantry had suffered many times its strength in losses and 5 of its men had earned the Medal of Honor, Ralph E. Pomeroy (20 May 1951), Benjamin F. Wilson (5 June 1951), Jack G. Hanson (7 June 1951), and Edward R. Schowalter Jr. (14 October 1952) . 

Not all losses were American as UN units such as the Ethiopian Kagnew Battalion who would be attached to the 31st Infantry during the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, and fought with distinction as Army observer, BG S.L.A. Marshall noted, &quot;...under full observation from enemy country, eight Ethiopians walked 800 yards across no-man&#x27;s land and up the slope of T-Bone Hill right into the enemy trenches. When next we looked, the eight had become ten. The patrol was dragging back two Chinese prisoners, having snatched them from the embrace of the Communist battalion...&quot;

==Garrison duty==
After the war, the 31st Infantry Regiment remained in Korea until the Army reorganized all infantry regiments into battle groups in 1957. The 1st Battle Group 31st Infantry, representing the only regiment that had never served in the continental United States, remained in Korea with the 7th Infantry Division. In 1958, the 2d Battle Group 31st Infantry was formed at Fort Rucker, Alabama, planting the proud regiment&#x27;s flag on the U.S. homeland for the first time in its history. In 1964, the 2d Battle Group was reorganized as the 5th Battalion 31st Infantry which was transferred to Ft. Benning, Georgia in 1967 and reassigned to the 197th Infantry Brigade. The 5th Battalion was inactivated at Ft. Benning in 1971.

In 1959, the 3d Battle Group 31st Infantry was formed in the Army Reserve in southern California as part of the 63rd Infantry Division.

==Vietnam War==
When the Army abandoned battle groups in favor of brigades and battalions in 1963, the 31st Infantry&#x27;s 1st and 2nd Battalions were reactivated in South Korea, the 3rd Battalion remained in the Army Reserve, and the 5th Battalion replaced the 2nd Battle Group at Fort Rucker. When the Vietnam War came, two more battalions of the 31st Infantry were formed. The 4th Battalion was formed at Fort Devens, Massachusetts in 1965 and the 6th Battalion was formed at Fort Lewis, Washington in 1967.
The 4th Battalion went to South Vietnam in the spring of 1967, operating initially in War Zone D and around Tay Ninh near the Cambodian border as a unit under the 196th Infantry Brigade (Separate). In 1967, the battalion moved north to help form the 23rd &quot;Americal&quot; Infantry Division. Operating at Quang Ngai, Chu Lai and the Que Son Valley for most of the rest of the war, the 4th Battalion fought to keep Viet Cong guerillas and the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam away from the coastal lowlands. Two of the battalion&#x27;s men earned the Medal of Honor almost a year apart near the bitterly contested village of Hiep Duc. When American forces departed, the 4th Battalion 31st Infantry was part of the last brigade to leave Vietnam. It was inactivated in 1971.

The 6th Battalion was sent to South Vietnam in the spring of 1968, arriving just in time to help recapture Saigon&#x27;s suburbs during the abortive May Offensive. For the next two years, the 6th Battalion fought all across the Mekong Delta and the Plain of Reeds. When the 9th Infantry Division departed in 1969, the 6th Battalion 31st Infantry formed the nucleus of a 1,200-man task force under LTC Gerald Carlson (Task Force Carlson) to cover the division&#x27;s departure. Remaining in Vietnam, the 6th Battalion conducted an Air Assault as part of the 3rd Brigade into the Parrot&#x27;s Beak, Cambodia in May 1970, making the famed &quot;Seminole Raid&quot; to seize and destroy a huge enemy base area bordering the Plain of Reeds. The battalion returned to Fort Lewis for inactivation in October 1970.

==Post-Vietnam==
In 1971, the 2d Battalion was inactivated in Korea. The 1st Battalion remained in Korea, however, serving there until its inactivation in 1987. It has still never served in the continental United States. In 1974, the 2d Battalion was reactivated at Fort Ord, CA where it remained until its inactivation in 1988. Beginning in 1980, the 6th Battalion, reactivated, served as component of the Opposition Force at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, as part of the 177th Armored Brigade until the battalion was reflagged as the 1st Battalion, 52nd Infantry Regiment in 1988.

The 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, was reactivated at Fort Sill, Oklahoma to support the Field Artillery School and the 6th Battalion was reactivated at Fort Irwin, California, serving there until its inactivation in 1988. In 1995, the 4th Battalion was inactivated at Fort Sill and reactivated as part of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York the following April. It is now the regiment&#x27;s only battalion on the active rolls.

==War on Terror==
In September and October 2001, the Polar Bears were once again called to arms to participate in the nation&#x27;s War on terror. From Maryland to Kuwait, Qatar and Uzbekistan the 31st protected American forces and facilities from terrorist attack. As America and its coalition partners struck back, the Polar Bears of A Company redeployed from Kuwait to Afghanistan. C Company and 4th Battalion Commander joined A Company for combat operations in Afghanistan, fighting in the Shah-I-Kowt Valley region and successfully eliminating it as a safe haven for international terrorism. In April 2002, the Polar Bears returned to Fort Drum, and in 2003 roughly 300 soldiers from the 4–31st deployed to Djibouti, B company to Iraq, and A Company to Camp Phoenix outside Kabul, Afghanistan in support of CJTF-HOA as TF 4–31. Company C was one of the units identified as having deployed.

C Company, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, conducted the various training exercises in July 2003, while in Djibouti including known distance ranges, both in Djibouti and Ethiopia; reflexive fire ranges, both in Djibouti and Ethiopia; AK-47 range for familiarization of the weapon system; familiarization ranges for shotguns and 9 mm pistols; external sling load training with Heavy Marine Helicopter Company (HMH-461) both day and night iterations to help certify them; its mortar platoon underwent training on the mortar ballistic computer and the plotting board to further their proficiency. They also conducted military to military training in Hurso and provided a security mission in the capital Addis Ababa.

In March 2003, B Company, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in order to conduct base defense and combat operations for (combined joint special operations task force-AP) CJSOTF- Arabian Peninsula. May 2003, C/4-31 and the battalion&#x27;s Mortar Platoon deployed to the Horn of Africa to conduct operations in Djibouti and Ethiopia in support of Operation Enduring Freedom for CJTF Horn of Africa. A/4-31 and HHC/4-31 deployed to Camp Phoenix in Kabul, Afghanistan to conduct security operations for CJTF-Phoenix which was training the Afghan National Army (ANA). Select members of the battalion were also designated as trainers for the ANA.

In May 2004, the Polar Bears again deployed with the 2nd BCT in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Upon completion of training at Kuwait, the task force assumed responsibility for conducting combat operations in the Taji, Saba al Boor, Al Rasheed, Kadhamiya, Abu Ghraib, and Yusufiyah districts of Baghdad. The most significant event for the battalion was during the first ever Iraqi national elections, when TF 4–31 provided polling centers in the Kadhamiya area with security and other force protection measures. The battalion was then called upon to secure the Abu Ghraib Internment Facility from attacks. Before redeployment the battalion conducted task force level air assaults and raids in enemy strongholds south of Baghdad. TF 4–31 returned to Fort Drum in June 2005, where they continued to train and prepare for the next call to battle.
Task Force 4–31 deployed again to Iraq for 15 months, beginning 16 August 2006. The 809 member task force was their brigade&#x27;s main effort and was given the daunting task of establishing the first permanent coalition force presence in the Sunni region south of Baghdad frequently referred to as &quot;The Sunni Triangle of Death&quot;. Working daily with their sister Iraqi Army battalion to re-establish the rule of law and the legitimacy of local Iraqi forces to the area, Task Force 4–31 became a model vehicle of contemporary counterinsurgency theory and practice. They established six patrol bases, 17 battle positions, assisted the Iraqi Army in the establishment of many more. They conducted over 50 air assaults and three amphibious operations, and fired nearly 400 counter-fire artillery missions against enemy forces and in support of troops in contact. TF 4–31 killed or wounded 51 insurgents and captured 148, while aiding the Iraqi Army in the capture of over 1,500 additional insurgents. While actively hunting insurgents, the soldiers of TF 4–31 set about improving the community, aiding in the improvement of schools, roads, irrigation canals, community centers, and emplacing solar power streetlights.

Task Force 4–31 suffered 28 soldiers killed in action. Five of those soldiers, all belonging to D/4-31, were killed on 12 May 2007 when their observation post was attacked by insurgents in a pre-dawn raid. Two additional soldiers at that position, SGT Alex Jimenez and PFC Byron Fouty, were captured during that attack and were missing until July 2008. The Polar Bears earned two Silver Stars and the battalion was awarded a Valorous Unit Award. Task Force 4–31 returned to Fort Drum in November 2007. In October 2009 TF 4–31 returned to Iraq for an 8-month deployment.

4–31 IN returned to Fort Drum at the end of June 2010 in accordance with President Obama&#x27;s pledge that all combat troops would be out of Iraq by the end of August.

In 2015, 4–31 was deployed to Afghanistan and was spread to 13 different Forward Operating Bases where they advised local police and military forces. They returned home in February 2016.

In 2018, 4-31 IN deployed again to Afghanistan for 9 months, spreading out across the country as the Theatre Response Force. They returned home in July 2019. 

The battalion was on deployment in Afghanistan as Operation Allies Refuge began in 2021. The battalion was protecting the Kabul 2021 evacuation from Afghanistan in August 2021.

In 2023, 4-31 IN deployed again to the CENTCOM Area of Operations (AOR), spreading out in several countries (Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan, and more).

==The Shanghai Bowl==

The Shanghai Bowl has become a very important symbol of the lineage of the 31st Infantry Regiment. The large silver punch bowl and its matching cups were made in 1932 by a Shanghai silversmith, fashioned from approximately 1,600 silver US trade dollars that were collected from the officers of the unit.

When Bataan fell to the Japanese in April 1942 it became obvious that the 31st would be forced to surrender. To keep these important items from falling into enemy hands, the bowl and cups, along with the colors and unit standard, were buried on Corregidor Island. The artifacts were finally retrieved in 1945.

The bowl now sits in the headquarters building of the regiment&#x27;s only remaining battalion: the 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, at Fort Drum, New York.

<doc id="162801" wikidata="Q1857616" url="?curid=162801" title="J. Wellington Wimpy">
<text>J. Wellington Wimpy, generally referred to as Wimpy, is a character in the comic strip &quot;Popeye&quot;, created by E. C. Segar, and in the &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons based upon the strip. Wimpy debuted in the strip in 1931 and was one of the dominant characters in the newspaper strip, but when &quot;Popeye&quot; was adapted as an animated cartoon series by Fleischer Studios, Wimpy became a minor character; Dave Fleischer said that the character in the original Segar strip was &quot;too smart&quot; to be used in the film cartoon adaptations. Wimpy appears in Robert Altman&#x27;s 1980 live-action musical film &quot;Popeye,&quot; played by Paul Dooley.

== Inspiration ==
The character seems to have been inspired by more than one person whom Segar had encountered. Wimpy&#x27;s personality was based upon that of William Schuchert, the manager of the Chester Opera House where Segar was first employed. &quot;Windy Bill&quot;, as he was known, was a pleasant, friendly man, fond of tall tales and hamburgers.

Additional sources suggest that Segar composed the character&#x27;s name from the names of two other acquaintances. According to fellow cartoonist Bill Mauldin, the name was suggested by that of Wellington J. Reynolds, one of Segar&#x27;s instructors at the Chicago Art Institute. In a brief 1935 interview in &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot;, H. Hillard Wimpee of Atlanta indicated that he was connected to the character, having worked with Segar at the &quot;Chicago Herald-Examiner&quot; in 1917. It became a custom in the office that whoever accepted an invitation for a hamburger would pay the bill. According to Wimpee, after seeing the character in the newspaper, he wrote to Segar in 1932 about Wimpy, &quot;afraid of being connected with what [Segar] was doing with [the character].&quot; He said Segar replied, &quot;You haven&#x27;t seen anything yet.&quot;

==Character==
Wimpy is Popeye&#x27;s friend, and he plays the role of both a &quot;straight man&quot; and a self-centered foil to Popeye. Wimpy is a soft-spoken romantic, intelligent and educated, a lazy coward, a miser, and a glutton. He is a scam artist, and frequently bereft of either cash or lodging (due to both his lethargy and voracious appetite), but frequently feigns high social status (sporadically, and possibly inaccurately, referring to himself as a former college alumnus). Besides mooching hamburgers, he also picks up discarded cigars. Popeye often tries to reform Wimpy&#x27;s character, but Wimpy never reforms.

Hamburgers are Wimpy&#x27;s all-time favorite food, and he is usually seen carrying or eating one or more at a time – e.g., in &quot;Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor&quot; he is seen grinding meat or eating burgers almost the entire time – however, he is usually too cheap or bankrupt to pay for them himself. A recurring joke involves Wimpy&#x27;s attempts to con other patrons of the diner owned by Rough House into buying his meal for him. His best-known catchphrase started in 1931 as, &quot;Cook me up a hamburger. I&#x27;ll pay you Tuesday.&quot; In March 1932, this then became the famous &quot;I&#x27;ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today&quot;. Rough House explains why Wimpy is able to get away with this tactic in one strip, stating that &quot;He never comes around on Tuesday&quot;. Rough House once suffered a mental breakdown from Wimpy&#x27;s shenanigans, and demanded that Wimpy be kept out of his hospital room. Wimpy disobeyed this command, resulting in a rare altercation with Popeye. The phrase was also slightly altered in the 1957 animated short &quot;Spree Lunch&quot; to &quot;I&#x27;ll have a hamburger, for which I will gladly pay you Tuesday.&quot; This phrase is now commonly used to illustrate financial irresponsibility and still appears in modern comedies such as &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; and &quot;The Office&quot;. The initial part of the phrase was the title of Episode 6 of the fourth season of &quot;Cheers&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll Gladly Pay You Tuesday.&quot;

In Robert Altman&#x27;s 1980 live-action musical film &quot;Popeye&quot;, where Wimpy was played by veteran character actor Paul Dooley, one of Harry Nilsson&#x27;s original songs, &quot;Everything Is Food&quot;, featured Dooley singing the catch-phrase, as he took a hamburger, as &quot;I would gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.&quot; The response from the chorus, as they reclaimed the same hamburger from him, uneaten, was &quot;He would gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.&quot; Later in the film, a sign in a restaurant reads &quot;Positively NO CREDIT. Especially you, Wimpy!&quot;

Wimpy had other frequently used lines in the original comic strip. On the occasion of another character (typically Popeye or Rough-House) successfully paying for his meal, Wimpy tends to lavish romanticized appraisals upon them, frequently exclaiming &quot;thank you too much&quot; and, to Popeye, lauding him as a &quot;friend&quot; and the &quot;gem of the ocean&quot;. In more disadvantageous circumstances, Wimpy tries to placate someone by saying, &quot;I&#x27;d like to invite you over to my house for a duck dinner.&quot; He then moves away quickly to a safe distance and yells, &quot;You bring the ducks!&quot; Another such line was, &quot;Jones is my name...I&#x27;m one of the Jones boys&quot; – an attempt to defuse a hostile situation with a mistaken identity. To deflect an enemy&#x27;s wrath, he would sometimes indicate a third party and say, &quot;Let&#x27;s you and him fight&quot;, starting a brawl from which he quickly withdrew. He also said &quot;Shake hands, my friend...I want to start my wristwatch&quot; on occasion, once more a reference to his lazy behavior. Wimpy is especially fond of duck hunting, and goes hunting with Popeye on numerous occasions, but usually gains his ducks in dishonest ways as well.

==In popular culture==
* Wimpy (along with Popeye, Olive and Bluto) was going to have a cameo in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but the rights to the characters could not be obtained.
* In the 1932 film &quot;If I Had a Million&quot;, three Marines played by Gary Cooper, Roscoe Karns, and Jack Oakie are sitting at a hamburger stand trying to buy hamburgers even though they are short of cash. Jack Oakie&#x27;s character quotes Wimpy&#x27;s standard line &quot;I&#x27;ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today&quot; with a smile to the man running the stand.
* During World War II, &quot;Wimpy&quot;, in reference to the character, was the nickname given to the Vickers Wellington bomber.
* Wimpy is also the namesake of the large chain of Wimpy hamburger restaurants which was founded in Bloomington, Indiana in the 1930s and opened in the UK in 1954; it has maintained operations overseas since 1967. Their UK website states, &quot;The name Wimpy is believed to have come from Popeye&#x27;s friend J Wellington Wimpy who loved hamburgers as much as Popeye loved spinach.&quot;
--&gt; * This seems to apply also to his other International Aliases; In Italy, for example, many restaurants and fast-food joints are named &quot;Poldo&quot; or &quot;Da Poldo&quot; , &quot;Poldo&quot; being Wimpy&#x27;s Italian-adapted name.
* Wimpy can also be found as the mascot for &quot;Wimpy&#x27;s Seafood Restaurant and Market&quot; in Osterville, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. (Established 1938)
* Wimpy made a cameo appearance (as an in-gag to both his facial features; in the context of beef related heart disease and affinity for hamburgers) in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;McStroke&quot;.
* Wimpy has appeared in two episodes of the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, often using his &quot;I&#x27;ll gladly pay you Tuesday&quot; line to buy hamburgers. Often it fails. Voiced by Scott Adsit and Seth Green.
* In the &quot;Good Eats&quot; second-season episode &quot;Daily Grind&quot; (aka &quot;A Grind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste&quot;), Alton Brown prepares the &quot;perfect burger&quot; (as well as meatloaf and meatballs) for a character named &quot;J. Wellington Whimpy&quot; (misspelled, but looking mostly like the version of Wimpy played by Paul Dooley in the &quot;Popeye&quot; film) played by then cast regular Steve Rooney.
* In the final Pooch the Pup cartoon called &quot;She Done Him Right&quot;, a dog character looking like Wimpy is seen playing a slot machine.
* Wimpy&#x27;s famous catchphrase gives the name to the hamburger review website A Hamburger Today.
* Wimpy is also the focus of an animated Bank of America commercial in which he uses a new smartphone app to finally pay for the food he mooched from his friends.
* Season 4 Episode 6 of &quot;Cheers&quot; is named &quot;I&#x27;ll Gladly Pay You Tuesday&quot;.
* Season 6 Episode 8 of &quot;Frasier&quot;, Niles refers to Claudia Kynock, a wealthy media owner, as a bulbous cartoon character who steals hamburgers. Frasier correctly asserts &quot;Wimpy&quot; but after Niles makes a series of self-deprecating remarks.
* Season 2 Episode 14 of &quot;The Office&quot;, Michael can be heard whispering to Stanley &quot;I&#x27;ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today&quot;.
* In the hit video game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, an NPC named Topper McNabb can be heard repeating &quot;I&#x27;ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today&quot; in the city of Stormwind, among other phrases.
* In the cartoon &quot;A Clean Shaven Man&quot;, he is depicted as being the owner of his own barber shop (though erroneously called Wimby&#x27;s instead of Wimpy&#x27;s in the color reprint by Turner Entertainment), with a sign on the inside of the empty shop reading &quot;Barber out getting a shave&quot;, Bluto remarks &quot;He&#x27;s probably out getting some &quot;hamburgers&quot;&quot;, and Popeye responds &quot;Yeah, I wouldn&#x27;t doubt that a bit&quot;.
* In a May 12, 2020 &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot; strip, Wimpy&#x27;s catchphrase was mentioned along with a thinly-veiled romantic innuendo between characters Amos and Edda and also in a May 2, 2022 strip, this time involving recurring characters Hugh and Xiulan in the same manner.

<text>McDonaldland is a McDonald&#x27;s media franchise and the fictional fantasy world inhabited by Ronald McDonald and his friends. Starting with the creation of Ronald McDonald in 1963, it is primarily developed and published by McDonald&#x27;s. Initial attempts to expand the McDonaldland universe by marketing agency Needham, Harper &amp; Steers were seemingly retconned due to legal issues, but ongoing aspects were expanded in McDonald&#x27;s projects in collaboration with Data East, Virgin Interactive, Treasure, SEGA, and Klasky Csupo.

The series centers on an adventuring magical clown named Ronald McDonald, who has red hair, white and red face paint, and wears a yellow jumpsuit over a red and white striped long-sleeve shirt with yellow gloves. His most regularly occurring friends are Grimace, the Hamburglar, Birdie the Early Bird, the Fry Kids, the McNugget Buddies, and the Happy Meal Gang. The fictional world has a variety of inspirations from general high fantasy and low fantasy, to corporate culture and corporate personality, to more specific influences including Christian media and the artwork of Koichi Kimura from &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot;.

In addition to being used in advertising, the characters were used as the basis for themed equipment in the &quot;PlayPlaces&quot; attached to some McDonald&#x27;s outlets, small recreational activity rooms intended for young children. While the McDonaldland portion has received somewhat less attention since 2003, several of the characters including Ronald McDonald, Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird, and the Hamburglar are still seen in commercials, Happy Meal toys, and materials supporting the Ronald McDonald House Charities. The characters received entire dedicated McDonaldland themed line-ups of Funko Pop! figures in 2019 and onward, including Ronald, Grimace, the Hamburglar, the Fry Kids and McNugget Buddies, Birdie the Early Bird, Mayor McCheese and Officer Big Mac.

==Overview==
===Setting===
McDonaldland takes place predominantly in its own high fantasy world, however parts of the McDonaldland world have low fantasy interactions with the real world. In earlier commercials, McDonaldland had sentient trees that grew apple pies, a hamburger patch, a French Fry patch, a shake volcano, Filet-O-Fish Lake, and the one-shot Sundae Mountain.

In &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot; the denizens of McDonaldland were shown to be able to travel between worlds using PlayPlace slides. Ronald is an adventurer with magical powers that acts as an ambassador for good and freedom, such as traveling to the rain forest to bring attention to endangered species and deforestation or delivering a safety PSA on the importance of seat belts.

Redemption arcs are incorporated within McDonaldland media. Grimace, a purple monster, was originally an antagonist that stole beverages and shakes from customers, but has since become a good guy. The Hamburglar, also originally a villain, was a thief that targeted hamburgers and sandwiches, but he is now more of a lovable rogue character.

===Locations===
The most often occurring regions, as seen in numerous McDonaldland commercials and video games are a forest, town, sea, and outer space. Their exact geographic layout is unknown, but within these regions are several locales including Grimace Island, a Western-themed area, several portals to real world McDonald&#x27;s restaurants, the Moon, and Ronald&#x27;s home.

==History==
The namesake for McDonaldLand is the McDonald&#x27;s restaurants founded by Richard and Maurice McDonald, popularized by Ray Kroc. Ronald McDonald was originally portrayed by Willard Scott, a former Bozo the Clown actor. In 1963, he and Washington, D.C. franchisee Oscar Goldstein created the initial aspects of the character. The initial idea to expand the McDonaldland universe was outsourced to Needham, Harper &amp; Steers in 1970–71 at the request of McDonald&#x27;s for its restaurants. The first commercial aired in January 1971. The early commercials were built on an upbeat, bubblegum-style tune and feature a narrator; many have plots that involve various villains, like the Hamburglar, Evil Grimace, and Captain Crook trying to steal a corresponding food item but are constantly foiled by Ronald.

In 1973, Sid and Marty Krofft sued McDonald&#x27;s, claiming that the entire McDonaldland premise plagiarized their television show &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;. In &quot;Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald&#x27;s Corp.&quot;, the Kroffts also claimed that the character Mayor McCheese was an infringement on their copyrighted character H.R. Pufnstuf (a mayor himself); Pufnstuf&#x27;s voice actor, Lennie Weinrib, was even involved with the McDonaldland ads, as the voice of Grimace. At trial, a jury found in favor of the Kroffts, and McDonald&#x27;s was ordered to pay $50,000. The case was appealed by both parties to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeals court in a 1977 decision, reassessed damages in favor of the Kroffts to more than $1,000,000. As a result, McDonald&#x27;s was ordered to stop producing some of the characters, or they must be modified to become legally distinct, and to stop airing commercials featuring those characters until then.

In 1976, Remco created a line of action figures to celebrate the characters.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the McDonaldland commercials remained a popular marketing device. The characters that remained following the lawsuit were Ronald McDonald, Grimace, Hamburglar and the French Fry Gobblins (renamed the Fry Guys and later the Fry Kids with the addition of the Fry Girls) while Mayor McCheese, Officer Big Mac, Captain Crook and the Professor were used until 1985. (However, they did return for a Sears advertisement in 1987.) Birdie the Early Bird would join the lineup soon after representing the restaurant&#x27;s new breakfast line in the early 1980s. Some of the characters&#x27; physical appearances were revised in later commercials (notably Hamburglar, Grimace and Birdie). From then on the characters lived in reality and interacted with real-life people, but commercials still took place in &quot;McDonaldland&quot;. Soon after the Happy Meal Gang and the McNugget Buddies were prominent features in the commercials (representing the restaurant&#x27;s Happy Meals and Chicken McNuggets respectively, being the menu items that mainly appealed to kids) along with Ronald.

Merchandise featuring the McDonaldland characters included a kid-friendly magazine titled &quot;McDonaldland Fun Times&quot;, which published six issues a year. A direct-to-video animated film titled &quot;The Adventures of Ronald McDonald: McDonaldland Treasure Island&quot; was released in 1989, featuring much of the &quot;McDonaldland&quot; characters from the 1980s. Video games featuring the characters were also released, such as &quot;M.C. Kids&quot; and &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot;.

From 1998 until 2003, &quot;Rugrats&quot; creators Klasky Csupo and McDonald&#x27;s released an animated direct-to-video series exclusively on VHS titled &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot;. The series depicted Ronald, Grimace, Birdie, the Hamburglar and a few new characters, like Ronald&#x27;s pessimistic dog Sundae. These videos would begin in live-action in what resembled a futuristic McDonaldland. Whenever the characters would enter down a tube or other means of travel, they would become animated. In all six episodes, Ronald goes on adventures with his friends and they learn new things along the way.

In the early 2000s, McDonald&#x27;s experimented with the possibility of animating the characters to improve ratings. Various spots featuring the Hamburglar and other characters alongside celebrities were planned but were canceled. A conflict emerged between agencies regarding whether to continue using the characters or to follow through the desire of ad agency Leo Burnett by elevating the &quot;I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it&quot; campaign. The McDonaldland premise was largely dropped out of campaigns and Happy Meal toys. Despite this, the characters continued to appear in advertising and McDonald&#x27;s PlayPlaces, decorative seats for children&#x27;s birthday parties and bibs, though only Ronald McDonald, Birdie, Grimace, the Hamburglar and the Fry Kids appear in them. They also appeared on some soft drink cups until 2008 and still appear as cookies in pouches titled &quot;McDonaldland Cookies&quot;.

McDonald&#x27;s CEO Jim Skinner defended Ronald McDonald, and said that he is &quot;here to stay&quot;. Today, the characters still appear on the windows of some McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. Modern commercials nowadays depict Ronald McDonald alone in real-world situations with children, whether he visits a local McDonald&#x27;s restaurant or to visit sick children at a Ronald McDonald House. The other characters still appear: the Happy Meal box character from the original 1979 Happy Meal Gang was redesigned to be a main character for Happy Meals during the 2010s, during the mid 2010s McDonald&#x27;s made a parody hipster version of the Hamburglar portrayed by Max Greenfield, Grimace had a non-speaking appearance in an advertisement for &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot; Happy Meal toys, and also made a cameo in the 2022 McDonald&#x27;s Super Bowl LVI commercial with Kanye West, where Grimace is animated and voiced by Ryan Reynolds.

Funko designed several ongoing Pop! Vinyl! figures starting in 2019 representing numerous McDonaldland characters including a line dedicated to The McNugget Buddies, as well as some characters thought to be retconned like Mayor McCheese &amp; Officer Big Mac.

==Characters==

* Ronald McDonald – The primary cultural icon and official mascot of McDonald&#x27;s. He is a clown with red hair and a big red smile who wears a yellow jumpsuit and red shoes.
* The Hamburglar (performed by Frank Delfino from 1971–1992, Jerry Maren in some commercials, Tommy Vicini from 1992–2003, voiced by Larry Storch from 1971–1986, Charlie Adler in &quot;The Hamburglar Touch&quot; commercial and in &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot;, Howard Morris from 1986–2003, and Carl W. Wolfe in some commercials during the 1990s) – A pint-sized burglar who was introduced in 1971 as one of the first antagonists of the commercials where he often attempts to steal hamburgers and cheeseburgers from Ronald. He was often referred to in his first commercial appearances as &quot;the crafty old Hamburglar&quot; and at least one ad promoting McDonald&#x27;s breakfast menu as &quot;The Lone Jogger&quot;, wearing a white T-shirt displaying that name on the front. Originally, the Hamburglar spoke in a gibberish language of &quot;robble robble&quot; which had to be translated by Captain Crook. He was reintroduced in 1985 as one of the main protagonists, with a radically friendlier appearance, where he spoke in normal sentences (but still peppered with &quot;robble&quot;), but retained his penchant for trying to steal burgers. In 2015, McDonald&#x27;s brought back the Hamburglar as part of the promotion of a new sirloin burger.
* Grimace (performed by Patty Saunders from 1971–1983, Mauri Bernstein in some &#x27;80s commercials, Terry Castillo-Faass from 1983–2000, voiced by Lennie Weinrib from 1971–1986, Frank Welker and sometimes Larry Moran from 1986–2003, Kevin Michael Richardson in &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot;) – A large purple monster who was introduced in November 1971 as the &quot;Evil Grimace&quot;. In Grimace&#x27;s first appearances, he was one of the original main antagonists and was depicted with two pairs of arms which were used to steal milkshakes and Cokes. &quot;Evil&quot; was soon dropped from Grimace&#x27;s name and he was reintroduced in 1972 as a protagonist where he only has one set of arms. He was then a rather clumsy, but still amiable monster from then on. His exact nature has been disputed: in a 2010 interview, a McDonald&#x27;s spokesperson said that Grimace was a taste bud. A 2014 Tweet from the McDonald&#x27;s Twitter account stated &quot;Grimace lore says he is the embodiment of a milkshake or a taste bud.&quot; In 2021, Brian Bates, a franchisee in Canada, stated in an interview widely reported on in the press that Grimace is an anthropomorphic taste bud. Writing in The Takeout, Lillian Stone disputed this, pointing out other material that established that Grimace was part of a species of Grimaces, including his Uncle O&#x27;Grimacey who promoted the Shamrock Shake. To celebrate the 51 year anniversary of the character&#x27;s inception, in 2023, McDonalds ran a promotion to celebrate Grimace&#x27;s birthday with the release of the Grimace Shake, which became an Internet meme on social media platforms. On June 12, 2024, Grimace threw the ceremonial first pitch at a New York Mets game, who were struggling at the time. After his appearance, the Mets went on a seven game winning streak and Grimace was embraced by the team&#x27;s fans. In September 2024, the Mets unveiled a purple seat at Citi Field, their home ballpark, to honor Grimace&#x27;s connection with the team and its fans. Grimace rode a 7 subway train branded with imagery featuring the character to Citi Field just before Game 3 of the 2024 National League Division Series between the Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies. 
* Fry Kids (various voices in the commercials, Kath Soucie, Paul Greenberg and Nika Futterman in &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot;) – Introduced in 1972 as &quot;Gobblins&quot;, the Fry Kids are small, shaggy, ball-like creatures with legs and no arms who try to steal other characters&#x27; French fries; they include both male Fry Guys and female Fry Girls. In 1998, Fry Kid #1 is yellow, Fry Kid #2 is red, and Fry Kid #3 is blue.
* Birdie the Early Bird (performed by Felix Silla 1979–1986, Patty Maloney 1986–2001, voiced by Russi Taylor in the commercials, Christine Cavanaugh in &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot;) – A yellow bird wearing a pink jumpsuit, flight cap and scarf who was introduced in 1980 as the first female character. Made to promote the company&#x27;s new breakfast items, she is depicted as a poor flyer and a somewhat clumsy person in general.
* The Happy Meal Gang – Introduced in 1979, they were joined by the McNugget Buddies in 1984 and the Happy Meal Box and the Under 3 Toy in 1992. They consist of The Happy Meal Hamburger (voiced by Bob Arbogast and later voiced by Jim Cummings), the Happy Meal Fries (voiced by Jeff Winkless and later voiced by Bob Bergen and then Tress MacNeille) and the Happy Meal Drink (voiced by Hal Smith and later voiced by Bill Farmer). The Happy Meal Box character was never voiced, but became a standalone part of marketing campaign for Happy Meals during the 2010s.
* Uncle O&#x27;Grimacey (performed by Robert Towers, voiced by Lennie Weinrib) – Introduced in 1977 for an advertising narrative of McDonald&#x27;s both in celebration of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day and to mark the annual appearance of the Shamrock Shake, he is depicted as Grimace&#x27;s uncle.
* CosMc (performed by Tommy Vicini, voiced by Frank Welker) – An alien who appeared in commercials during the mid-1980s. CosMc was a character in the video game &quot;M.C. Kids&quot;. The character occasionally came to steal food for his planet, CosMcland. It also spoke in a mixture of robot-esque sounds and normal speech. The character was used as an inspiration for the spin-off restaurant CosMc&#x27;s.
* The McNugget Buddies (variously voiced by Greg Berg, Pat Fraley, Katie Leigh, Pat Musick, Don Messick, Hal Rayle, and Frank Welker in the commercials, Pamela Adlon, Lisa Raggio and Charlie Adler in &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot;) – A bunch of anthropomorphic regular-sized Chicken McNuggets who were introduced in 1984. In 1998–2003, McNugget #1&#x27;s comb, arms and boots are blue, McNugget #2&#x27;s are red, and McNugget #3&#x27;s are purple.
* Bernice (performed by Tim Blaney and Tony Urbano) – A strange creature that was introduced in 1992 and that ate inedible things like the script in the three-part &quot;Ronald McDonald Makin&#x27; Movies&quot; commercial.
* Vulture – An unnamed vulture who spoke in a monotone voice.
* Sundae (performed by Verne Troyer, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) – Ronald&#x27;s dog who has appeared only in &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot; where he was animated with puppetry. The animatronic Sundae was created by Optic Nerve Studios, Inc. Troyer was assisted in performing Sundae by puppeteers Mark Garbarino, Bryan Blair, Russell Shinkle and Shaun Smith. One commercial involving Ronald using the McDonald&#x27;s sign as a pogo stick depicted Sundae as an actual dog.
* Iam Hungry (voiced by Jeff Lupetin) – A short-lived McDonaldland character who was introduced in 1998 and was dropped in 2001. Self-proclaimed as the &quot;Vice President of Snacking&quot;, the character is a floating, fast-moving green fuzzball with orange arms and a monstrous face who has a big appetite.
* Mike the Microphone – A one-time character created especially for the Kid Rhino albums &quot;Ronald Makes It Magic&quot; and &quot;Ronald McDonald Presents Silly Sing Along&quot;. Voiced by Larry Moran.

===Former characters===
These characters have not appeared since the 1980s, and the reason remains unknown. Though many assume it had something to do with the lawsuit, this might be incorrect as Mayor McCheese and Officer Big Mac both appear in the 2020 Funko McDonaldland Pop! Vinyl! figures.

* Mayor McCheese (performed by Billy Curtis from 1971–1979, Jerry Maren from 1980–1985, voiced by Howard Morris impersonating Ed Wynn in the commercials, Bob Joles impersonating Wynn in &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot;) – An enormous cheeseburger-headed character who first appeared in 1971 and was removed in 1985. He sported a top hat, a diplomat&#x27;s sash and a pair of pince-nez spectacles and was portrayed as McDonaldland&#x27;s bumbling and incompetent mayor. He was the subject of a lawsuit filed by Sid and Marty Krofft for similarities to H.R. Pufnstuf; specifically, both were characters with enormous heads who served as the elected leader of a fantastical setting.
* Officer Big Mac (performed by Jerry Maren, voiced by Ted Cassidy) – Introduced in 1971 and dropped in 1985, he is similar to Mayor McCheese in appearance in that he has a large burger for a head. In his case, his head is a Big Mac (minus the vegetables and special sauce) rather than a cheeseburger. Officer Big Mac is the chief of police and as such he wears a constable&#x27;s uniform with a disproportionately small custodian helmet resting atop his head bun. As the main source of law and order in McDonaldland, Officer Big Mac spends most of his time chasing Hamburglar and Captain Crook.
* Captain Crook (performed by Robert Towers, voiced by Larry Storch in 1971–1983, Tim Blaney in 1984–1985) – A pirate captain who was introduced in 1971 as one of the main antagonists and dropped in 1985. Captain Crook steals Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and often interprets Hamburglar&#x27;s gibberish. He was revised in 1984 with a Muppet-like appearance and later became simply known as &quot;The Captain&quot; where he has a parrot and operates the S.S. &quot;Filet-O-Fish&quot;.
* The Professor (portrayed by Lou Wagner, voiced by John Stephenson in the 1970s, Andre Stojka in the 1980s) – A scientist who is McDonaldland&#x27;s inventor and researcher. He was introduced in 1971 and has invented different devices throughout McDonaldland such as the Psychedelic Electronic Hamburger Machine (which made only pumpkins for some reason), the Dinner Gong, an invisible car that helped Ronald McDonald get to McDonald&#x27;s to meet with the kids, a magnetic bat, and the Chicken McNugget Dip-O-Matic. In his first appearances, he was a bespectacled man with a beard, neck-length hair, and a hat. In the 80s, he was a bespectacled man with a moustache, a long nose, and a helmet with a lightbulb on it. The character was dropped in 1985.

=== New character ===

* Happy – an anthropomorphic Happy Meal box introduced in 2009, he is the current mascot of McDonald&#x27;s, replacing Ronald McDonald. His features include his boxy red body, a wide smile, human-like teeth and eyes, and flexible slender arms and legs. He has been shown to live in &quot;Happy City&quot;, along with others who look like him. During promotional campaigns, he has interacted with popular characters such as the Minions and Super Mario, among others.

==In other media==

* Ronald McDonald appears during a child&#x27;s birthday party at a McDonald&#x27;s in one scene of the film &quot;Mac &amp; Me&quot;. He is portrayed by Squire Fridell, who played Ronald in commercials during the latter half of the 1980s.
* Mayor McCheese makes appearances in three episodes of the Fox animated television series &quot;Family Guy&quot;: &quot;Believe It or Not, Joe&#x27;s Walking on Air&quot;, &quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot; and &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day in Quahog&quot;. In all three episodes, he is voiced by John Viener.
* &quot;&quot; featured the fictional mayor and chief of police of Leonardo, New Jersey wearing costumes based on Mayor McCheese and Office Big Mac, respectively (both had been going to costume parties when the episode&#x27;s plot, a deadly virus supposedly being released into Leonardo, occurred, and in the case of the mayor he was unable to remove his costume when the zipper got stuck). Steve-Dave and Walt asked &quot;Big Mac&quot; if &quot;this administration will ever bring the Hamburglar to justice&quot;, while a reporter inquires as to whether or not Grimace is immune to the virus (&quot;Nothing can kill the Grimace&quot;). &quot;Mayor McCheese&quot; was voiced by Al Franken while &quot;Officer Big Mac&quot; is voiced by Mike McShane. On the DVD commentary, Kevin Smith indicated that had the show gone past 6 episodes, &quot;Mayor McCheese&quot; would&#x27;ve been kept as a recurring character (with him always in his costume, always being on his way to or from a costume party).
* In Carlton Mellick III&#x27;s Bizarro fiction books &quot;Warrior Wolf Women of the Wasteland&quot; and its sequel &quot;Barbarian Beast Bitches of the Badlands&quot;, set in a post-apocalyptic world, McDonaldland is the last remaining city-state, governed by The Blessed McDonald&#x27;s Corporation and completely themed around McDonald&#x27;s (e.g., all buildings are red and yellow). Every day, its inhabitants pray five times, work two shifts, and eat three meals of its fast-food – which, due to containing abundant chemicals, mutates men into potentially growing extra limbs (and then being eventually seized by Fry Guys police officers) and women into becoming increasingly wolf-like each time they have sex (and then being banished into the outer Wastelands to fight for their own survival); any other food or beverage is illegal. Once cherished McDonaldland characters such as Mayor McCheese and the Hamburglar are reimagined in horrifically twisted versions.

<doc id="162807" wikidata="Q1377422" url="?curid=162807" title="Profit maximization">
<text>In economics, profit maximization is the short run or long run process by which a firm may determine the price, input and output levels that will lead to the highest possible total profit (or just profit in short). In neoclassical economics, which is currently the mainstream approach to microeconomics, the firm is assumed to be a &quot;rational agent&quot; (whether operating in a perfectly competitive market or otherwise) which wants to maximize its total profit, which is the difference between its total revenue and its total cost. 

Measuring the total cost and total revenue is often impractical, as the firms do not have the necessary reliable information to determine costs at all levels of production. Instead, they take more practical approach by examining how small changes in production influence revenues and costs. When a firm produces an extra unit of product, the additional revenue gained from selling it is called the marginal revenue (formula_1), and the additional cost to produce that unit is called the marginal cost (formula_2). When the level of output is such that the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost (formula_3), then the firm&#x27;s total profit is said to be maximized. If the marginal revenue is greater than the marginal cost (formula_4), then its total profit is not maximized, because the firm can produce additional units to earn additional profit. In other words, in this case, it is in the &quot;rational&quot; interest of the firm to increase its output level until its total profit is maximized. On the other hand, if the marginal revenue is less than the marginal cost (formula_5), then too its total profit is not maximized, because producing one unit less will reduce total cost more than total revenue gained, thus giving the firm more total profit. In this case, a &quot;rational&quot; firm has an incentive to reduce its output level until its total profit is maximized.

There are several perspectives one can take on profit maximization. First, since profit equals revenue minus cost, one can plot graphically each of the variables revenue and cost as functions of the level of output and find the output level that maximizes the difference (or this can be done with a table of values instead of a graph). Second, if specific functional forms are known for revenue and cost in terms of output, one can use calculus to maximize profit with respect to the output level. Third, since the first order condition for the optimization equates marginal revenue and marginal cost, if marginal revenue (formula_1) and marginal cost (formula_2) functions in terms of output are directly available one can equate these, using either equations or a graph. Fourth, rather than a function giving the cost of producing each potential output level, the firm may have input cost functions giving the cost of acquiring any amount of each input, along with a production function showing how much output results from using any combination of input quantities. In this case one can use calculus to maximize profit with respect to input usage levels, subject to the input cost functions and the production function. The first order condition for each input equates the marginal revenue product of the input (the increment to revenue from selling the product caused by an increment to the amount of the input used) to the marginal cost of the input.

For a firm in a perfectly competitive market for its output, the revenue function will simply equal the market price times the quantity produced and sold, whereas for a monopolist, which chooses its level of output simultaneously with its selling price. In the case of monopoly, the company will produce more products because it can still make normal profits. To get the most profit, you need to set higher prices and lower quantities than the competitive market. However, the revenue function takes into account the fact that higher levels of output require a lower price in order to be sold. An analogous feature holds for the input markets: in a perfectly competitive input market the firm&#x27;s cost of the input is simply the amount purchased for use in production times the market-determined unit input cost, whereas a monopsonist’s input price per unit is higher for higher amounts of the input purchased.

The principal difference between short run and long run profit maximization is that in the long run the quantities of all inputs, including physical capital, are choice variables, while in the short run the amount of capital is predetermined by past investment decisions. In either case, there are inputs of labor and raw materials.

==Basic definitions==

Any costs incurred by a firm may be classified into two groups: fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs, which occur only in the short run, are incurred by the business at any level of output, including zero output. These may include equipment maintenance, rent, wages of employees whose numbers cannot be increased or decreased in the short run, and general upkeep. Variable costs change with the level of output, increasing as more product is generated. Materials consumed during production often have the largest impact on this category, which also includes the wages of employees who can be hired and laid off in the short run span of time under consideration. Fixed cost and variable cost, combined, equal total cost.

Revenue is the amount of money that a company receives from its normal business activities, usually from the sale of goods and services (as opposed to monies from security sales such as equity shares or debt issuances).

The five ways formula is to increase leads, conversation rates, average dollar sales, the average number of sales, and average product profit. Profits can be increased by up to 1,000 percent, this is important for sole traders and small businesses let alone big businesses but none the less all profit maximization is a matter of each business stage and greater returns for profit sharing thus higher wages and motivation.

Marginal cost and marginal revenue, depending on whether the calculus approach is taken or not, are defined as either the change in cost or revenue as each additional unit is produced or the derivative of cost or revenue with respect to the quantity of output. For instance, taking the first definition, if it costs a firm $400 to produce 5 units and $480 to produce 6, the marginal cost of the sixth unit is 80 dollars. Conversely, the marginal income from the production of 6 units is the income from the production of 6 units minus the income from the production of 5 units (the latter item minus the preceding item).

==Total revenue – total cost perspective==
To obtain the profit maximizing output quantity, we start by recognizing that profit is equal to total revenue (formula_8) minus total cost (formula_9). Given a table of costs and revenues at each quantity, we can either compute equations or plot the data directly on a graph. The profit-maximizing output is the one at which this difference reaches its maximum.

In the accompanying diagram, the linear total revenue curve represents the case in which the firm is a perfect competitor in the goods market, and thus cannot set its own selling price. The profit-maximizing output level is represented as the one at which total revenue is the height of formula_10 and total cost is the height of formula_11; the maximal profit is measured as the length of the segment formula_12. This output level is also the one at which the total profit curve is at its maximum.

If, contrary to what is assumed in the graph, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the output market, the price to sell the product at can be read off the demand curve at the firm&#x27;s optimal quantity of output. This optimal quantity of output is the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

==Marginal revenue – marginal cost perspective==

An equivalent perspective relies on the relationship that, for each unit sold, marginal profit (formula_13) equals marginal revenue (formula_1) minus marginal cost (formula_2). Then, if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at some level of output, marginal profit is positive and thus a greater quantity should be produced, and if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost, marginal profit is negative and a lesser quantity should be produced. At the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost, marginal profit is zero and this quantity is the one that maximizes profit. Since total profit increases when marginal profit is positive and total profit decreases when marginal profit is negative, it must reach a maximum where marginal profit is zero—where marginal cost equals marginal revenue—and where lower or higher output levels give lower profit levels. In calculus terms, the requirement that the optimal output have higher profit than adjacent output levels is that:

:formula_16

, where formula_17 and formula_18 refer to the midpoints between the old and new values of price and quantity respectively. The marginal revenue from an incremental unit of output has two parts: first, the revenue the firm gains from selling the additional units or, giving the term formula_19. The additional units are called the marginal units. Producing one extra unit and selling it at price formula_17 brings in revenue of formula_17. Moreover, one must consider &quot;the revenue the firm loses on the units it could have sold at the higher price&quot;—that is, if the price of all units had not been pulled down by the effort to sell more units. These units that have lost revenue are called the infra-marginal units. That is, selling the extra unit results in a small drop in price which reduces the revenue for all units sold by the amount formula_22. Thus, formula_23, where formula_24 is the price elasticity of demand characterizing the demand curve of the firms&#x27; customers, which is negative. Then setting formula_25 gives formula_26 so formula_27 and formula_28. Thus, the optimal markup rule is:

:formula_29

:or equivalently

:formula_30.

In other words, the rule is that the size of the markup of price over the marginal cost is inversely related to the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand for the good.

The optimal markup rule also implies that a non-competitive firm will produce on the elastic region of its market demand curve. Marginal cost is positive. The term formula_31 would be positive so formula_32 only if formula_24 is between formula_34 and formula_35 (that is, if demand is elastic at that level of output). The intuition behind this result is that, if demand is inelastic at some value formula_36 then a decrease in formula_18 would increase formula_17 more than proportionately, thereby increasing revenue formula_39; since lower formula_18 would also lead to lower total cost, profit would go up due to the combination of increased revenue and decreased cost. Thus, formula_36 does not give the highest possible profit.

==Marginal product of labor, marginal revenue product of labor, and profit maximization==

The general rule is that the firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The profit maximization issue can also be approached from the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the variable input? To maximize profit the firm should increase usage of the input &quot;up to the point where the input&#x27;s marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs&quot;. Mathematically, the profit-maximizing rule is formula_42, where the subscript formula_43 refers to the commonly assumed variable input, labor.

The marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in the variable input, that is, formula_44.

formula_45 is the product of marginal revenue and the marginal product of labor or formula_46.

==Criticism ==
The maximization of producer surplus can in some cases reduce consumer surplus. Some forms of producer profit maximization are considered anti-competitive practices and are regulated by competition law. Maximization of short-term producer profit can reduce long-term producer profit, which can be exploited by predatory pricing such as dumping.

==Government Regulation==
Market quotas reflect the power of a firm in the market, a firm dominating a market is very common, and too much power often becomes the motive for non-Hong behavior. Predatory pricing, tying, price gouging and other behaviors are reflecting the crisis of excessive power of monopolists in the market. In an attempt to prevent businesses from abusing their power to maximize their own profits, governments often intervene to stop them in their tracks. A major example of this is through anti-trust regulation which effectively outlaws most industry monopolies. Through this regulation, consumers enjoy a better relationship with the companies that serve them, even though the company itself may suffer, financially speaking.

<text>The 20th Air Base Group is a disbanded group of the United States Air Force. It was part of the Far East Air Force, during World War II. The group was based at Nichols Field, in the Philippines. It surrendered to the Japanese in the spring of 1942, but was kept on the rolls as an active unit until April 1946. It was disbanded in 1984.

The Unit&#x27;s first predecessor, the 66th Aero Squadron served at a training base during World War I. It was consolidated with the 66th Service Squadron, which had provided maintenance support at Nichols Field since 1921. In the late 1930s, the unit assumed administrative support functions as well and was expanded to a group.

The first unit holding the name 20th Air Base Group was active up until 1942, and is where the majority of this article focuses. However, a second unit, the 20th Airdrome Group, was renamed the 20th ABG in 1948, remaining as part of the 20th Fighter Wing. It later became the 20th Mission Support Group, and is still supporting the 20th Fighter Wing.

==History==
===World War I===
The first predecessor of the group was the 66th Aero Squadron, which was organized in April 1918 at Kelly Field, Texas. As soon as the squadron was organized it moved to Eberts Field, Arkansas to join the flying school there. In the summer of 1918, the Air Service reorganized its units at its flying schools as lettered squadrons and the squadron became Squadron A, Eberts Field. Shortly after the end of the World War I, the squadron was demobilized and its personnel were absorbed by the Flying School Detachment at Eberts Field.

===Interwar years in the Philippines===
In June 1921, Air Park No. 11 was organized at Clark Field, Philippines, moving to what became Nichols Field before the end of the year. In 1923, the Air Service renamed its air parks as service squadrons and the unit became the 66th Service Squadron, with the mission of providing second level maintenance for the aircraft of the 4th Composite Group at Nichols. Due to post-war shortages in officers, garrison units in the Philippines were manned assigned only 50% of their authorized officer personnel through the first half of the 1920s.

In 1936 the Air Corps consolidated many of its World War I Aero Squadrons with units formed after the war but bearing the same number, and the old 66th Aero Squadron was consolidated with the post-war 66th Squadron.

In 1938, the Air Corps reorganized its support units and the 66th was consolidated with the Station Complement, Nichols Field as the Base Headquarters and 20th Air Base Squadron. In the fall of 1940, air base squadrons expanded into groups and were assigned materiel squadrons for maintaining aircraft and air base squadrons to provide administrative support, and the unit became the 20th Air Base Group.

===Defense of the Philippines===
The 20th Group&#x27;s station at Nichols Field came under Japanese air attack as World War II began in the Pacific. Although Far East Air Force had built up to the largest American overseas force in terms of personnel, much of its equipment was en route when the Japanese attacked. As the war began, the group supported the 2d Observation Squadron, 17th Pursuit Squadron and 34th Pursuit Squadron at Nichols. Three days after the start of the war, 10 December 1941, saw the first concentrated Japanese attacks on Nichols. By the end of the attack all observation airplanes at Nichols had been destroyed or rendered unserviceable. By 24 December, all bombers had been flown to Australia and air force headquarters and all combat units except for a few fighters soon followed.

By the end of December, all American forces were being withdrawn to Bataan. Colonel Harold H. George, of 5th Interceptor Command assumed control of all Air Corps units remaining in the Philippines. With the flying mission being performed by a handful of fighter pilots, the bulk of the group&#x27;s personnel were employed as infantry. By May 1942, resistance in the Philippines had ended and the group ceased to exist as an organized military formation.

<text>Danzig is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Danzig, released in August 1988. The album was the first release on producer Rick Rubin&#x27;s new label Def American Recordings. Def American&#x27;s successor, American Recordings, reissued the album in the United States and United Kingdom in 1998. It remains the band&#x27;s best-selling album having been certified gold in the U.S. in 1994, and has since been certified platinum. Danzig promoted the album with a successful world tour in 1988–1989.

==Music and recording==
&quot;Danzig&quot; was recorded at Atlantic Recording Studios and Chung King Metal, and mixed at Smoke Tree and Village. These sessions took place between September 1987 and April 1988.

The song &quot;Mother&quot;, retitled as &quot;Mother &#x27;93&quot; and with live audience overdubs, became a hit on radio and MTV in 1993–94 after a new video-single with live footage was created to mark its inclusion on &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot;. The song was also later included on various hard rock and heavy metal music compilations, and featured in the video game series &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;. It also appeared on the soundtrack to the 2013 film &quot;The Hangover Part III&quot;.

Glenn Danzig originally wrote the songs &quot;Twist of Cain&quot; and &quot;Possession&quot; for his previous band, Samhain. Lyrically, &quot;Twist of Cain&quot; is inspired by the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Guitarist John Christ described the recording of &quot;Twist of Cain&quot;: &quot;We started writing that song even before [drummer] Biscuits joined the band. At first we started recording it in G, then at the last minute we decided that A was better. We kept the drum tracks as they were and re-recorded the guitars, bass and vocals. Not many people know this, but James Hetfield (of Metallica) came down and recorded some backing vocals on that track.&quot; Hetfield also recorded backing vocals on &quot;Possession&quot;; however, due to contractual reasons, he could not be credited in the album insert. A backwards piano track is used during the intro to &quot;Possession&quot;.

John Christ has described &quot;She Rides&quot; as &quot;Our first sex song...it&#x27;s such a stripped-down song, just a couple of guitar tracks and almost no bass. &quot;She Rides&quot; probably has the best vocal performance on the album, though. There are also some really weird background noises and moaning sounds on it.&quot; Generally the song refers to mythology on Lilith. References to &quot;she rides/from the daylight in chains&quot; reflect traditional methods for binding demons. The song also appears to take inspiration from the poetry of Christopher Brennan, in particular part xiii of the &quot;Lilith&quot; sequence of The Forest of Night: &quot;She is the night: all horror is of her...&quot;

While the album&#x27;s liner notes expressly state &quot;All songs written by Glenn Danzig&quot;, the song &quot;The Hunter&quot; was written by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s and Carl Wells. Originally recorded by Albert King, the Danzig version of the song only features slightly modified lyrics.

==Artwork and packaging==
Original LP, CD, and cassette versions of the album cover had no identifying text whatsoever, only a white skull on a black background. The skull, also used on the Samhain albums &quot;Initium&quot; and &quot;November-Coming-Fire&quot;, was taken from the cover of the Marvel comic book &quot;The Saga of Crystar&quot;, &quot;Crystal Warrior&quot; (issue 8). It was drawn by artist Michael Golden, who is not credited. The skull on the album cover was drawn by Danzig.

Later pressings of the compact disc added the Danzig band name logo in the lower right. While 1990–1998 pressings of the CD had the Parental Advisory label in the form of a sticker on the cellophane wrap, pressings since 1998 have the label printed on the artwork. &quot;Danzig&quot; is one of few albums labeled as &quot;explicit&quot; despite the virtual absence of profanity, save for one use of &quot;whore&quot;. Glenn Danzig commented on this use of the advisory label: &quot;That&#x27;s because of its content. We&#x27;re making people think. You&#x27;re not allowed to make people think in the United States. You&#x27;re not allowed to have them question the government or authority.&quot;

==Reception==

* AllMusic - &quot;Danzig debuts with a record of simple, pounding, bluesy metal featuring lead singer Glenn Danzig&#x27;s trademark Elvis-meets-Jim Morrison bellow and outlandishly dark, evil lyrics. There isn&#x27;t a great deal of musical variety or complexity here, but the band powers its way through such signature tunes as &#x27;Twist of Cain,&#x27; &#x27;Am I Demon,&#x27; and the (future) hit &#x27;Mother&#x27; with a primal energy.&quot;
* &quot;Thrasher&quot; - &quot;Glenn Danzig has built up a new unit that&#x27;s so damn powerful, so relentlessly brutal, it staggers the senses just to comprehend. The ensemble drives forth with a new force, an ambitious direction and absolutely ferocious power. Glenn&#x27;s vocals have matured with age; his croons are commanding expressions of the full range of his voice...the music explodes with a vigorous combination of hooks and punches that wallop a tight, clean drive; a forceful nucleus of hard rocking energy. All together Danzig provide a heavy dose of pure entertainment that has awesome momentum and pile-driving fury. &quot;Danzig&quot; becomes more impressive with every listen.&quot;
* &quot;Trouser Press&quot; - &quot;&quot;Danzig&quot; is a crunchy and lusty demonic cross between The Doors, Misfits and Black Sabbath. Roughly half of the album is ominous and mighty, the rest displays the weak underbelly of Rubin&#x27;s thinly homogeneous production.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Danzig&quot; as 23rd on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Music videos==
Music videos were released for the songs &quot;Twist of Cain&quot;, &quot;Am I Demon&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;She Rides&quot;. Upon its release the music video for &quot;Mother&quot; was banned by MTV for containing controversial imagery. All four music videos later appeared on the &quot;Danzig&quot; home video.

==35th anniversary==
In May 2023, Glenn Danzig unveiled a series of live performance dates in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the self-titled debut album. The band played the first Danzig album for these concerts.

<text>Transvestic fetishism is a psychiatric diagnosis applied to people who are sexually aroused by the act of cross-dressing and experience significant distress or impairment – socially or occupationally – because of their behavior. It differs from cross-dressing without distress or impairment, and/or for entertainment or other purposes that do not involve sexual arousal. Under the name transvestic disorder, it is categorized as a paraphiliac disorder in the DSM-5.

== In the DSM-5 ==
The DSM-5 states that late-onset gender dysphoria in adolescent and adult natal males is preceded by &quot;transvestic behavior with sexual excitement&quot; in many cases.

According to DSM-IV, transvestic fetishism was limited to heterosexual men; however, the DSM-5 does not have this restriction, and opens it to women and men with this interest, regardless of their sexual orientation. It is, however, usually documented in men.

There are two key criteria before a psychiatric diagnosis of &quot;transvestic fetishism&quot; is made:
# Individuals must be sexually aroused by the act of cross-dressing.
# Individuals must experience significant distress or impairment – socially or occupationally – because of their behavior.

<text>American Recordings (formerly Def American Recordings) is an American record label headed by producer Rick Rubin. The label has featured artists such as Slayer, the Black Crowes, ZZ Top, Danzig, Trouble, Tom Petty, Johnny Cash, The Mother Hips, and System of a Down.

== Company history ==

The label Def American Recordings was founded after Rick Rubin left Def Jam Recordings in 1988. Among the first acts to be signed were Slayer (which followed Rubin from Def Jam), Danzig, The Four Horsemen, Masters of Reality, and Wolfsbane, as well as indie rockers the Jesus and Mary Chain and controversial stand-up comedian Andrew Dice Clay. Rubin continued his association with hip-hop music as well by signing artists such as the Geto Boys and Sir Mix-a-Lot. Def American had its first major success with The Black Crowes&#x27; 1990 debut album, &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;, which was eventually certified quintuple platinum by the RIAA. The group&#x27;s 1992 follow-up, &quot;The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot;, gave the label its first No.1 album. Rapper Sir Mix-a-Lot obtained a number-one hit with the song &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; as well as a platinum-selling album titled &quot;Mack Daddy&quot;. Heavy metal acts Slayer and Danzig also enjoyed notable commercial success, with Slayer in particular having several gold-certified albums. Rubin produced many of the recordings on the label, as well as directing other related ventures.

Rubin changed the name of the company from Def American Recordings to American Recordings in 1993 after reportedly seeing the word &quot;def&quot; in the dictionary. The company was reportedly renamed because he believed that finding the word in a notable source was against the anti-establishment image that he was trying to project. A mock funeral was held for the word &quot;def&quot; on August 27, 1993, at Hollywood Memorial Park (now Hollywood Forever Cemetery). The guest list included Black Panthers with prop shotguns, The Amazing Kreskin, Tom Petty and Rosanna Arquette, The Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; Flea, Sir Mix-a-Lot, and Warner Bros. Records chairman (and pallbearer) Mo Ostin, with Reverend Al Sharpton presiding. Before &quot;def&quot; was lowered to its final resting place, some of the 1,500+ mourners placed flowers and various musical and personal memorabilia in the open casket. Afterwards, mourners followed a 19th-century-style horse-drawn hearse and a six-piece brass band playing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; to the after party—named Ciao Def—at a bowling alley. The new birth certificate was obtained and the company name changed to American Recordings.

American had several sub-labels over the years, including Onion Records, Ill Labels, Wild West, Whte Lbls, and Infinite Zero. The last was a partnership with Henry Rollins that specialized in reissues of obscure albums. None of these labels made the distribution transition after American Recordings left Warner Bros. Records in 1997, and its recordings were deleted.

== Distribution ==
The first Def American release was &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; by Slayer, which had a Def Jam Recordings logo on its first pressing. Fans of heavy metal music consider it one of the most critically acclaimed and important albums in the genre&#x27;s history, and it continues to obtain much high praise from fans and critics. A Def Jam Recordings logo was also present on its follow-up album. However, because Russell Simmons felt that Slayer&#x27;s music was not in line with Def Jam, and because Def Jam&#x27;s then-distributor Columbia Records refused to release it, it was released through Geffen Records, and Rubin took the rights of the release to the new label with him after the split. Danzig&#x27;s 1988 debut album was the first release to bear the Def American logo. Initially, the label was distributed by Geffen through Warner Bros. Records (now known as Warner Records), but when Geffen refused to distribute the self-titled album by the Geto Boys and the controversy it caused, distribution was absorbed by Warner Bros. proper, which released all subsequent Def American titles.

American&#x27;s distribution has been handled through several labels over the years. American&#x27;s first incarnation was distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros. Records from 1988 to 1990. After a falling-out with Geffen over the content of the Geto Boys&#x27; only Def American release, Warner Bros. itself took over distribution duties from 1990 to 1997 in the United States, while the international distribution was handled by BMG. However, sub-label Ill Labels was distributed by hip-hop specialist and former Warner Bros. subsidiary Tommy Boy Records as part of its deal. For a brief time during the 1990s, the label also distributed Too Pure Records in the US.

Rubin signed a distribution deal with Columbia Records in 1997, which distributed the label&#x27;s titles until 2001. That year, Universal Music Group, through its Island Def Jam Music Group division, took over distribution. In 2005, with the exception of the recordings of Johnny Cash, the label returned to the aegis of Warner Bros. Records. Non-US distribution was handled by Sony Music Entertainment until the deal with Columbia expired.

In 2007, Warner Bros. Records, which was American&#x27;s home from 1990 to 1997, acquired the rights to the extensive American Recordings catalog, which included Johnny Cash, The Black Crowes, The Jayhawks, Slayer, and Danzig. However, American&#x27;s current roster (except Tom Petty) was transferred to BMG successor Sony BMG (now known as Sony Music Entertainment) in mid-2007 after a legal battle between Warner and Rubin over the details of their former arrangement, in which American Recordings would sign and provide creative services for artists, while Warner Bros. was only to handle promotion, sales, marketing, and distribution because Rubin was prompted to move his label with his appointment to co-chairman of Columbia Records in the spring of 2007.

In 2012, Rick Rubin, upon his exit from Sony Music Entertainment, signed a new deal with Universal Republic Records (now Republic Records) for a new incarnation of American Recordings. The first albums to be released under this new deal were ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;La Futura&quot; and The Avett Brothers&#x27; &quot;The Carpenter&quot;. During this period, American moved all of its catalog to Universal Music Group, the exceptions being System of a Down, which remained with Columbia Records &amp; Sony Music Entertainment, plus Chino XL&#x27;s &quot;Here To Save You All&quot; and Tom Petty&#x27;s &quot;Highway Companion&quot;, which remained with Warner Records &amp; Warner Music Group.

<text>Tights are a kind of cloth garment, most often sheathing the body from the waist to the toe tips with a tight fit, hence the name. They come in absolute opaque, opaque, sheer and fishnet styles — or a combination, such as the original concept of the American term pantyhose with sheer legs and opaque panty. A variant, toe tights, are tights with individual toes, in the same way toe socks are socks with individual toes.

== Terminology and related clothing ==

When made of fine silk, this hosiery was considered to be a stocking. When nylon fibres were developed and introduced in the 1940s, these stockings were referred to as nylons. When the separate legs were woven together with a panty that covered the lower torso up to the waist in a single, integrated format, the term pantyhose was coined, since it was a one piece construction of a panty with a pair of separate hose, one for each leg. This joining together eliminated any need for garters for holding up each separate leg covering.

In American English, the difference between pantyhose and tights is determined in the weight of the yarn used and the density or tightness of weaving to which the garment is knitted. Generally, anything up to forty denier in the leg or overall is known as pantyhose and anything over that can be classified as tights, as for example &#x27;running tights&#x27; and &#x27;cycling tights&#x27;. Tights can be sheer yet solid in colour, whereas leggings are practically or absolutely opaque, not sheer. Thus, the almost-opaque tights are sometimes labelled as semi-opaque and are not considered suitable as pants due to being too revealing or immodest. In the United Kingdom, the word &quot;tights&quot; is used for footed garments, which would always be worn under another item of clothing such as shorts or a skirt, while &quot;leggings&quot; refers to footless leg-wear of any denier, the exception being ballet tights which may have an opening under the sole allowing them to be rolled up to expose the foot without removing the garment. The word &#x27;pantyhose&#x27; is not used in British English.

There are many sub-classifications of tights or pantyhose that describe the precise construction (such as control top, seamless, support and sheer). Although most tights are mainly nylon or cotton, lycra is normally included in modern blends to improve fit. Athletic tights are absolute opaque and often footless, although they may have a &quot;stirrup&quot; that goes under the foot to hold the cuff down near the ankle.

== Historical background ==

Originally, leggings covered only the legs (not the lower torso); were two separate pieces; and did not contain elastic fibres, so were cut close fitting (to use less fabric) and were loose, not tight.

Originally derived from the hose worn by European men several centuries ago, tights were made as close fitting as possible for practical reasons when riding horseback. For men of nobility, the material would be made of silk or fine wool rather than the coarser fabrics used by the lower classes. At the time of King Henry VIII of England, such was the male fashion for displaying a well turned leg that even the king padded the calf area under his hose. Portrait paintings of him and other nobility often portray the wearing of a codpiece covering the groin.

In both historic and modern times, the wearing of tight hosiery by males has been associated with an accompanying garment fitted at the groin over the male genitalia. In the 15th century, some men wore an elaborate and decorative codpiece to accentuate their endowment. In modern times, tights intended for dancers are usually opaque, although their form-fitting nature can still reveal the exact contours of the anatomy underneath. Male ballet dancers generally wear a dance belt beneath their tights both to provide support to the genitalia and to promote a smooth, regular appearance. Wearing two pairs of tights is also a common practice among male dancers, as it guards against the combination of stretched fabric and bright stage lights making them appear translucent.

The wearing of tights has a history going back several centuries, when they were worn by both men and women. Today, they are worn primarily by women and girls. In recent years, however, they have been offered as men&#x27;s fashion.

== Current use ==

Tights are most commonly worn with a skirt or dress by women. They are also most commonly worn under trousers or shorts by men.

In the world of theatre tights are also common, especially in Renaissance-era costumes, and dance, particularly in ballet.

The term &quot;tights&quot; has been used to try to ridicule certain traditional British uniform. Most famously the Serjeants-at-Arms at the Palace of Westminster, after a protester got past the security, were described in the media as &quot;middle aged men in tights.&quot;

=== Athletic use ===
For horseback riding, &quot;tights&quot; in some equestrian circles can refer to tightly fitting riding pants of light material that extend all the way down to the rider&#x27;s ankle and worn with a &#x27;paddock&#x27; style (ankle height) boot. Such pants are worn in summer or as an undergarment in winter. In warm climates they can be worn all year round. These &quot;riding tights&quot; are cheaper to buy than jodhpurs or breeches which are a type of riding pant made of heavier material and which extends only to mid calf length and are intended to be worn with tall riding boots.

Tights can also describe the leg coverings worn in bicycling in cold weather and in other athletic activities, especially by runners. These tights are usually a thicker spandex-blend, and are usually footless. It has also been advocated by some sport scientists that the wearing of tights can reduce muscle tissue vibration.

Athletic tights received some publicity during the 2005–2006 basketball season, when players started wearing the ankle-length tights under their uniform shorts. A prominent NBA player, Kobe Bryant, was one of the first to wear tights, and the style was subsequently adopted by several other NBA players, as well as some college and high school players. The style sparked controversy, leading to proposals to prohibit wearing tights with basketball uniforms.

In colder temperatures outdoors, American football players sometimes wear spandex tights next to their skin beneath their normal padded stretchy, tightly fitted pants. In British English such garments are referred to as &#x27;skins&#x27;. Athletic tights are considered unisex.

=== Health and beauty use ===

Because the fabric used in tights is made of interwoven fabric such as nylon or cotton, there are pores in the fabric where modern manufacturers have been able to place other items which benefit the skin. They can use microencapsulation techniques to place substances such as moisturizers and other skin creams in the tights.

== Design features ==

Tights are manufactured in many different varieties for stylistic and comfort reasons. Certain leg wear designs include a darker brief or no visible brief at all, the former being used to create extra support or a shaping effect.

One area where design is vastly different from model to model is in the toe area. There are several varieties of toe type, such as sandal toes, open toes and reinforced, all offering different effects. Whilst some descriptions of the difference between open toe and sandal toe can cause confusion, the industry standard is that a sandal toe covers the whole foot but without a seam that would be visible in an open shoe, and open toe tights use either a silicone band or toe loops to anchor the garment whilst leaving the toes uncovered.

<doc id="162835" wikidata="Q1065104" url="?curid=162835" title="Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak">
<text>Sir Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak (&quot;Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke&quot;; 3 June 1829 – 17 May 1917), born &quot;Charles Anthoni Johnson&quot;, ruled as the head of state of Raj of Sarawak from 3 August 1868 until his death. He succeeded his uncle, James Brooke, as the second White Rajah.

==Biography==
Charles Anthoni Johnson was born in Berrow Vicarage, Burnham, Somerset, in England, to the Reverend Francis Charles and Emma Frances Johnson, née Brooke. Emma was the younger sister of James Brooke, the first Rajah of Sarawak. In addition to Charles, Francis and Emma had other children: Captain John Brooke Johnson (1823–1868) (later Brooke), Mary Anna Johnson (b. 1824), Harriet Helena Johnson (b. 1826), Charlotte Frances Johnson (b. 1828), Captain (William) Frederic Johnson (b. 1830), Emma Lucy Johnson (b. 1832), Margaret Henrietta Johnson (1834–1845), Georgianna Brooke Johnson (1836–1854), James Stuart Johnson (1839–1840), and Henry Stuart Johnson (b. 1841).

Brooke was educated at Crewkerne Grammar School and entered the Royal Navy. He entered the service of his uncle James, the first Rajah of Sarawak, in 1852, took his name, and began as Resident at the Lundu station in the Raj of Sarawak. In the 1857 rebellion against the White Rajah, Charles Brooke helped his uncle put down the rebellion led by Liu Shan Bang with his force composed of Ibans and local Bidayuh tribes. It is noted that Brooke&#x27;s Iban forces pursued the remaining rebels to Bau, where they killed the 3,000 villagers including women, children and the elderly in a massacre. In 1865, James named Charles as his successor.

Brooke married Margaret Alice Lili de Windt at Highworth, Wiltshire, on 28 October 1869; she was raised to the title of Ranee of Sarawak with the style of Her Highness on the same day. They had six children, three of whom survived infancy:
* Dayang Ghita Brooke (1870–1873)
* James Harry Brooke (1872–1873)
* Charles Clayton Brooke (1872–1873)
* Charles Vyner Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak (1874–1963)
* Bertram Willes Dayrell Brooke, Tuan Muda (1876–1965)
* Henry Keppel Brooke, Tuan Bongsu (1878–1927)

Brooke’s son Charles Vyner Brooke succeeded him as the third and last White Rajah. He had another son, Esca Brooke (1868–1951) from a previous marriage with a Malay woman known as Dayang Mastiah. Esca was sent to England at the age of six, cared for and later adopted by the Reverend William Daykin. Eventually, they moved to Canada. Esca married and had three children. Brooke lost an eye at some point in a riding accident, and allegedly replaced it with a false eye intended for a stuffed albatross.

Brooke resigned his commission in the Royal Navy in 1861 and continued the work his uncle had started, suppressing piracy, slavery, and head-hunting, while encouraging trade and development and expanding the borders of his domain as the opportunities arose. In 1891 he established the Sarawak Museum, the first museum in Borneo. Brooke founded a boys&#x27; school in 1903, called the &#x27;Government Lay School&#x27;, where Malays could be taught in the Malay language. This was the forerunner of SMK Green Road. By the time of his death, Britain had established a protectorate over Sarawak, it had a parliamentary government, a railway, and oil had been discovered.

All three White Rajahs are buried in St Leonard&#x27;s Church in the village of Sheepstor on Dartmoor, Devon.

==Honours==
British Honours
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), 1888

At least two Bornean species were named in Brooke&#x27;s honour:
* Brooke&#x27;s Squirrel (&quot;Sundasciurus brookei&quot;), named by Oldfield Thomas
* &quot;Cervus brookei&quot;, a deer named by Charles Hose in 1893

<doc id="162840" wikidata="Q1783600" url="?curid=162840" title="Concentration ratio">
<text>In economics, concentration ratios are used to quantify market concentration and are based on companies&#x27; market shares in a given industry. 

A concentration ratio (CR) is the sum of the percentage market shares of (a pre-specified number of) the largest firms in an industry. An &quot;n&quot;-firm concentration ratio is a common measure of market structure and shows the combined market share of the &quot;n&quot; largest firms in the market. For example, if &quot;n&quot; = 5, &quot;CR&quot;5 defines the combined market share of the five largest firms in an industry. 

== Calculation ==
The concentration ratio is calculated as follows: 
formula_1
where formula_2 defines the market share of the formula_3th largest firm in an industry as a percentage of total industry market share, and formula_4 defines the number of firms included in the concentration ratio calculation.

The formula_5 and formula_6 concentration ratios are commonly used. Concentration ratios show the extent of largest firms&#x27; market shares in a given industry. Specifically, a concentration ratio close to 0% denotes a low concentration industry, and a concentration ratio near 100% shows that an industry has high concentration.

== Concentration levels ==
Concentration ratios range from 0%–100%. Concentration levels are explained as follows: 
== Benefits and shortfalls ==
Concentration ratios can readily be calculated from industry data, but they are a simplistic, single parameter statistic. They can be used to quantify market concentration in a given industry in a relevant and succinct manner, but do not capture all available information about the distribution of market shares. In particular, the definition of the concentration ratio does not use the market shares of all the firms in the industry and does not account for the distribution of firm size. Also, it does not provide much detail about competitiveness of an industry.

The following example exposes the aforementioned shortfalls of the concentration ratio. 

=== Example ===
The table below shows the market shares of the largest firms in two different industries (Industry A and Industry B). Aside from the tabulated market shares for Industry A and Industry B, both industries are the same in terms of the number of firms operating in the industry and their respective market shares. In this example, in both cases, all other firms have a share of less than 10%.

It is evident from these figures that Industry B is more concentrated than Industry A, since the market share is distributed more heavily towards the more dominant firms. However, Industry A and Industry B both have &quot;CR&quot;4 ratios of 80%. This shows that the CR ratio does not fully take into account the distribution of market share amongst the most dominant firms.

<doc id="162841" wikidata="Q370089" url="?curid=162841" title="Herfindahl–Hirschman index">
<text>The Herfindahl index (also known as Herfindahl–Hirschman Index, HHI, or sometimes HHI-score) is a measure of the size of firms in relation to the industry they are in and is an indicator of the amount of competition among them. Named after economists Orris C. Herfindahl and Albert O. Hirschman, it is an economic concept widely applied in competition law, antitrust regulation, and technology management. HHI has continued to be used by antitrust authorities, primarily to evaluate and understand how mergers will affect their associated markets.

HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each competing firm in the industry and then summing the resulting numbers (sometimes limited to the 50 largest firms). The result is proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very small firms to a single monopolistic producer. Increases in the HHI generally indicate a decrease in competition and an increase of market power, whereas decreases indicate the opposite. Alternatively, the index can be expressed per 10,000 &quot;points&quot;. For example, an index of .25 is the same as 2,500 points.

The major benefit of the Herfindahl index in relation to measures such as the concentration ratio is that the HHI gives more weight to larger firms. Other advantages of the HHI include its simple calculation method and the small amount of often easily obtainable data required for the calculation.

The HHI has the same formula as the Simpson diversity index, which is a diversity index used in ecology; the inverse participation ratio (IPR) in physics; and the inverse of the effective number of parties index in political science.

==Example==
Consider an example of 3 firms before and after a merger, with the top 2 firms producing 40% of goods each, and the other firm producing 20%. 

Prior to Merger: formula_1

Now let&#x27;s consider the top 2 firms merging.

Post Merger: formula_2

As can be seen prior to the merger, the HHI, while not low, is in a range that allows for strong competition. However, post merger the HHI reaches 68%, approaching a HHI consistent with monopolies. This high HHI would lead to weak competition. 

This demonstrates how the HHI enables antitrust authorities to understand the impact that mergers have on the market.

The index involves taking the market share of the respective market competitors, squaring it, and adding them together (e.g. in the market for X, company A has 30%, B, C, D, E and F have 10% each and G through to Z have 1% each). When calculating HHI the post merger level of the HHI score and the total increase of the HHI score are considered when reviewing the outcome. If the resulting figure is above a certain threshold then economists will consider the market to have a high concentration (e.g. market X&#x27;s concentration is 0.142 or 14.2%). This threshold is considered to be 0.25 in the U.S., while the EU prefers to focus on the level of change, for instance that concern is raised if there is a 0.025 change when the index already shows a concentration of 0.1. So to take the example, if in market X company B (with 10% market share) suddenly bought out the shares of company C (with 10% also) then this new market concentration would make the index jump to 0.162. Here it can be seen that it would not be relevant for merger law in the U.S. (being under 0.18) or in the EU (because there is not a change over 0.025).

==Formula==

formula_3
where formula_4 is the market share of firm formula_5 in the market, and formula_6 is the number of firms. Therefore, in a market with 5 firms each producing 20%, the HHI would be formula_7.

The Herfindahl Index (&quot;HHI&quot;) ranges from 1/&quot;N&quot; (in case of perfect competition) to 1 (in case of monopoly), where &quot;N&quot; is the number of firms in the market. Equivalently, if percents are used as whole numbers, as in 75 instead of 0.75, the index can range up to 1002, or 10,000.

An &quot;HHI&quot; below 0.01 (or 100) indicates a highly competitive industry, Mergers and acquisitions with an increase of 100 points or less will usually not have any anti competitive effects and will require no further analysis. &lt;br&gt;An &quot;HHI&quot; below 0.15 (or 1,500) indicates an unconcentrated industry. Mergers and acquisitions between 100 and 1500 points are unlikely to have anti-competitive effects and will most likely not need further analysis.&lt;br&gt;An &quot;HHI&quot; between 0.15 and 0.25 (or 1,500 to 2,500) indicates moderate concentration. Mergers and acquisitions that result in moderate market concentration from HHI increases will raise anti-competitive concerns and will require further analysis.&lt;br&gt;An &quot;HHI&quot; above 0.25 (above 2,500) indicates high concentration. Mergers and acquisitions with HHI scores of 2,500 or above will be considered anti competitive and an in-depth analysis produced, if the scores are well above 2,500 they are considered to enhance market power they may only be allowed to progress when significant evidence is shown that the merger or acquisition will not increase market power.

A small index indicates a competitive industry with no dominant players. If all firms have an equal share the reciprocal of the index shows the number of firms in the industry. When firms have unequal shares, the reciprocal of the index indicates the &quot;equivalent&quot; number of firms in the industry. Using case 2, we find that the market structure is equivalent to having 1.55521 firms of the same size.

There is also a normalized Herfindahl index. Whereas the Herfindahl index ranges from 1/&quot;N&quot; to one, the normalized Herfindahl index ranges from 0 to 1. It is computed as:
*formula_8 for &quot;N&quot; &gt; 1 and 
*formula_9 for &quot;N&quot; = 1
where again, &quot;N&quot; is the number of firms in the market, and &quot;HHI&quot; is the usual Herfindahl Index, as above.

Using the normalized Herfindahl index, information about the total number of players (&quot;N&quot;) is lost, as shown in the following example:

Assume a market with two players and equally distributed market share; formula_10 and formula_11. Now compare that to a situation with three players and again an equally distributed market share; formula_12, note that formula_11 like the situation with two players. The market with three players is less concentrated, but this is not obvious looking at just &quot;H*&quot;. Thus, the normalized Herfindahl index can serve as a measure for the equality of distributions, but is less suitable for concentration.

==Problems==
The usefulness of this statistic to detect monopoly formation is directly dependent on a proper definition of a particular market (which hinges primarily on the notion of substitutability). The index fails to take into consideration the complex nature of the market being tested.

* For example, if the statistic were to look at a hypothetical financial services industry as a whole, and found that it contained 6 main firms with 15% market share apiece, then the industry would look non-monopolistic. However, suppose one of those firms handles 90% of the checking and savings accounts and physical branches (and overcharges for them because of its monopoly), and the others primarily do commercial banking and investments. In this scenario, the index hints at dominance by one firm. The market is not properly defined because checking accounts are not substitutable with commercial and investment banking. The problems of defining a market work the other way as well. To take another example, one cinema may have 90% of the movie market, but if movie theaters compete against video stores, pubs and nightclubs then people are less likely to be suffering due to market dominance.
* Another typical problem in defining the market is choosing a geographic scope. For example, firms may have 20% market share each, but may occupy five areas of the country in which they are monopoly providers and thus do not compete against each other. A service provider or manufacturer in one city is not necessarily substitutable with a service provider or manufacturer in another city, depending on the importance of being local for the business—for example, telemarketing services are rather global in scope, while shoe repair services are local.

The United States federal anti-trust authorities such as the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission use the Herfindahl index as a screening tool to determine whether a proposed merger or acquisition is likely to raise antitrust concerns. Increases of over 0.01 (100) generally provoke scrutiny, although this varies from case to case. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice considers Herfindahl indices between 0.15 (1,500) and 0.25 (2,500) to be &quot;moderately concentrated&quot; and indices above 0.25 to be &quot;highly concentrated&quot;. However, these indices scores are not rigid guidelines that must be followed, while high levels of concentration is concerning, they indices scores provide ways to identify which mergers and acquisitions are potentially noncompetitive. There are other factors that need to be considered that will either help reinforce or counter the harmful effects of higher market concentration. The Herfindahl-Hirschman index is used as a starting point to gauge initial market power and then determine if additional information is needed to conduct further analysis on any potential anti-competitive concerns.

==Intuition==
When all the firms in an industry have equal market shares, formula_14. The Herfindahl is correlated with the number of firms in an industry because its lower bound when there are &quot;N&quot; firms is 1/&quot;N&quot;. In the more general case of unequal market share, 1/&quot;H&quot; is called &quot;equivalent (or effective) number of firms in the industry&quot;, &quot;N&quot;eqi or &quot;N&quot;eff. An industry with 3 firms cannot have a lower Herfindahl than an industry with 20 firms when firms have equal market shares. But as market shares of the 20-firm industry diverge from equality the Herfindahl can exceed that of the equal-market-share 3-firm industry (e.g., if one firm has 81% of the market and the remaining 19 have 1% each, then formula_15). A higher Herfindahl signifies a less competitive (i.e., more concentrated) industry.

=== Appearance in market structure ===
It can be shown that the Herfindahl index arises as a natural consequence of assuming that a given market&#x27;s structure is described by Cournot competition. Suppose that we have a Cournot model for competition between formula_16 firms with different linear marginal costs and a homogeneous product. Then the profit of the formula_5-th firm formula_18 is:
formula_19
where formula_20 is the quantity produced by each firm, formula_21 is the marginal cost of production for each firm, and formula_22 is the price of the product. Taking the derivative of the firm&#x27;s profit function with respect to its output to maximize its profit gives us:
formula_23
Dividing by formula_24 gives us each firm&#x27;s profit margin:
formula_25
where formula_26 is the market share and formula_27 is the price elasticity of demand. Multiplying each firm&#x27;s profit margin by its market share gives us:
formula_28
where formula_29 is the Herfindahl index. Therefore, the Herfindahl index is directly related to the weighted average of the profit margins of firms under Cournot competition with linear marginal costs.

=== Effective assets in a portfolio ===
The Herfindahl index is also a widely used metric for portfolio concentration. In portfolio theory, the Herfindahl index is related to the effective number of positions formula_30 held in a portfolio, where formula_31 is computed as the sum of the squares of the proportion of market value invested in each security. A low H-index implies a very diversified portfolio: as an example, a portfolio with formula_32 is equivalent to a portfolio with formula_33 equally weighted positions. The H-index has been shown to be one of the most efficient measures of portfolio diversification.

It may also be used as a constraint to force a portfolio to hold a minimum number of effective assets:
formula_34
For commonly used portfolio optimization techniques, such as mean-variance and CVaR, the optimal solution may be found using second-order cone programming.

==Decomposition==
Supposing that formula_6 firms share all the market, each one with a participation of formula_36 and market share formula_37, then the index can be expressed as formula_38, where formula_39 is the statistical variance of the firm shares, defined as formula_40 where formula_41 is the mean of participations. If all firms have equal (identical) shares (that is, if the market structure is completely &quot;symmetric&quot;, in which case formula_42) then formula_39 is zero and formula_29 equals formula_45. If the number of firms in the market is held constant, then a higher variance due to a higher level of asymmetry between firms&#x27; shares (that is, a higher &quot;share dispersion&quot;) will result in a higher index value.

<text>Color television (American English) or colour television (British English) is a television transmission technology that includes color information for the picture, so the video image can be displayed in color on the television set. It improves on the monochrome or black-and-white television technology, which displays the image in shades of gray (grayscale). Television broadcasting stations and networks in most parts of the world upgraded from black-and-white to color transmission between the 1960s and the 1980s. The invention of color television standards was an important part of the history and technology of television.

Transmission of color images using mechanical scanners had been conceived as early as the 1880s. A demonstration of mechanically scanned color television was given by John Logie Baird in 1928, but its limitations were apparent even then. Development of electronic scanning and display made a practical system possible. Monochrome transmission standards were developed prior to World War II, but civilian electronics development was frozen during much of the war. In August 1944, Baird gave the world&#x27;s first demonstration of a practical fully electronic color television display. In the United States, competing color standards were developed, finally resulting in the NTSC color standard that was compatible with the prior monochrome system. Although the NTSC color standard was proclaimed in 1953, and limited programming soon became available, it was not until the early 1970s that color television in North America outsold black-and-white units. Color broadcasting in Europe did not standardize on the PAL or SECAM formats until the 1960s.

Broadcasters began to upgrade from analog color television technology to higher resolution digital television ; the exact year varies by country. While the changeover is complete in many countries, analog television remains in use in some countries.

==Development==
The human eye&#x27;s detection system in the retina consists primarily of two types of light detectors: rod cells that capture light, dark, and shapes/figures, and the cone cells that detect color. A typical retina contains 120 million rods and 4.5 million to 6 million cones, which are divided into three types, each one with a characteristic profile of excitability by different wavelengths of the spectrum of visible light. This means that the eye has far more resolution in brightness, or &quot;luminance&quot;, than in color. However, post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image.

The eye has limited bandwidth to the rest of the visual system, estimated at just under 8 Mbit/s. This manifests itself in a number of ways, but the most important in terms of producing moving images is the way that a series of still images displayed in quick succession will appear to be continuous smooth motion. This illusion starts to work at about 16 frame/s, and common motion pictures use 24 frame/s. Television, using power from the electrical grid, historically tuned its rate in order to avoid interference with the alternating current being supplied – in North America, some Central and South American countries, Taiwan, Korea, part of Japan, the Philippines, and a few other countries, this was 60 video fields per second to match the 60 Hz power, while in most other countries it was 50 fields per second to match the 50 Hz power. The NTSC color system changed from the black-and-white 60-fields-per-second standard to 59.94 fields per second to make the color circuitry simpler; the 1950s TV sets had matured enough that the power frequency/field rate mismatch was no longer important. Modern TV sets can display multiple field rates (50, 59.94, or 60, in either interlaced or progressive scan) while accepting power at various frequencies (often the operating range is specified as 48–62 Hz).

In its most basic form, a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images, one each in the three colors of red, green, and blue (RGB). When displayed together or in rapid succession, these images will blend together to produce a full-color image as seen by the viewer. To do so without making the images flicker, the refresh time of all three images put together would have to be above the critical limit, and generally the same as a single black and white image. This would require three times the number of images to be sent in the same time, greatly increasing the amount of radio bandwidth required to send the complete signal and thus similarly increasing the required radio spectrum. Early plans for color television in the United States included a move from very high frequency (VHF) to ultra high frequency (UHF) to open up additional spectrum.

One of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic system developed by RCA that encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color-capable televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.

===Early television===
Experiments with facsimile image transmission systems that used radio broadcasts to transmit images date to the 19th century. It was not until the 20th century that advances in electronics and light detectors made television practical. A key problem was the need to convert a 2D image into a &quot;1D&quot; radio signal; some form of image scanning was needed to make this work. Early systems generally used a device known as a &quot;Nipkow disk&quot;, which was a spinning disk with a series of holes punched in it that caused a spot to scan across and down the image. A single photodetector behind the disk captured the image brightness at any given spot, which was converted into a radio signal and broadcast. A similar disk was used at the receiver side, with a light source behind the disk instead of a detector.

A number of such mechanical television systems were being used experimentally in the 1920s. The best-known was John Logie Baird&#x27;s, which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in Britain for several years. Indeed, Baird&#x27;s system was demonstrated to members of the Royal Institution in London in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true, working television system. In spite of these early successes, all mechanical television systems shared a number of serious problems. Being mechanically driven, perfect synchronization of the sending and receiving discs was not easy to ensure, and irregularities could result in major image distortion. Another problem was that the image was scanned within a small, roughly rectangular area of the disk&#x27;s surface, so that larger, higher-resolution displays required increasingly unwieldy disks and smaller holes that produced increasingly dim images. Rotating drums bearing small mirrors set at progressively greater angles proved more practical than Nipkow discs for high-resolution mechanical scanning, allowing images of 240 lines and more to be produced, but such delicate, high-precision optical components were not commercially practical for home receivers.

It was clear to a number of developers that a completely electronic scanning system would be superior, and that the scanning could be achieved in a vacuum tube via electrostatic or magnetic means. Converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances. The two key advances were Philo Farnsworth&#x27;s electronic scanning system, and Vladimir Zworykin&#x27;s Iconoscope camera. The Iconoscope, based on Kálmán Tihanyi&#x27;s early patents, superseded the Farnsworth-system. With these systems, the BBC began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936, but these were shut down again with the start of World War II in 1939. In this time thousands of television sets had been sold. The receivers developed for this program, notably those from Pye Ltd., played a key role in the development of radar.

By 22 March 1935, 180-line black-and-white television programs were being broadcast from the Paul Nipkow TV station in Berlin. In 1936, under the guidance of the Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, direct transmissions from fifteen mobile units at the Olympic Games in Berlin were transmitted to selected small television houses () in Berlin and Hamburg.

In 1941, the first NTSC meetings produced a single standard for US broadcasts. US television broadcasts began in earnest in the immediate post-war era, and by 1950 there were 6 million televisions in the United States.

===All-mechanical color===

The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built.

Among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning, although he gave no practical details. Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it. An Armenian inventor, Hovannes Adamian, also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him, and was patented in Germany on 31 March 1908, patent number 197183, then in Britain, on 1 April 1908, patent number 7219, in France (patent number 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent number 17912).

Shortly after his practical demonstration of black and white television, on 3 July 1928, Baird demonstrated the world&#x27;s first color transmission. This used scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources, controlled by the signal, at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. The demonstration was of a young girl wearing different colored hats. The girl, Noele Gordon, later became a TV actress in the soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;. Baird also made the world&#x27;s first color over-the-air broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird&#x27;s Crystal Palace studios to a projection screen at London&#x27;s Dominion Theatre.

Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells, amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full-color image.

===Hybrid systems===

As was the case with black-and-white television, an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like Baird&#x27;s. The obvious solution on the broadcast end would be to use three conventional Iconoscopes with colored filters in front of them to produce an RGB signal. Using three separate tubes each looking at the same scene would produce slight differences in parallax between the frames, so in practice a single lens was used with a mirror or prism system to separate the colors for the separate tubes. Each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems.

The problem with this approach was there was no simple way to recombine them on the receiver end. If each image was sent at the same time on different frequencies, the images would have to be &quot;stacked&quot; somehow on the display, in real time. The simplest way to do this would be to reverse the system used in the camera: arrange three separate black-and-white displays behind colored filters and then optically combine their images using mirrors or prisms onto a suitable screen, like frosted glass. RCA built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on 5 February 1940, privately shown to members of the US Federal Communications Commission at the RCA plant in Camden, New Jersey. This system, however, suffered from the twin problems of costing at least three times as much as a conventional black-and-white set, as well as having very dim pictures, the result of the fairly low illumination given off by tubes of the era. Projection systems of this sort would become common decades later, however, with improvements in technology.

Another solution would be to use a single screen, but break it up into a pattern of closely spaced colored phosphors instead of an even coating of white. Three receivers would be used, each sending its output to a separate electron gun, aimed at its colored phosphor. However, this solution was not practical. The electron guns used in monochrome televisions had limited resolution, and if one wanted to retain the resolution of existing monochrome displays, the guns would have to focus on individual dots three times smaller. This was beyond the state of the art of the technology at the time.

Instead, a number of hybrid solutions were developed that combined a conventional monochrome display with a colored disk or mirror. In these systems the three colored images were sent one after each other, in either complete frames in the &quot;field-sequential color system&quot;, or for each line in the &quot;line-sequential&quot; system. In both cases a colored filter was rotated in front of the display in sync with the broadcast. Since three separate images were being sent in sequence, if they used existing monochrome radio signaling standards they would have an effective refresh rate of only 20 fields, or 10 frames, a second, well into the region where flicker would become visible. In order to avoid this, these systems increased the frame rate considerably, making the signal incompatible with existing monochrome standards.

The first practical example of this sort of system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very &quot;deep&quot;, but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console. However, Baird was not happy with the design, and as early as 1944 had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.

In 1939, Hungarian engineer Peter Carl Goldmark introduced an electro-mechanical system while at CBS, which contained an Iconoscope sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set. The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on 29 August 1940, and shown to the press on 4 September.

CBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as 28 August 1940, and live cameras by 12 November. NBC (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on 20 February 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on 1 June 1941. These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The War Production Board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 April 1942, to 20 August 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.

===Fully electronic===

As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the &quot;Telechrome&quot;. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. Baird&#x27;s demonstration on 16 August 1944, was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird&#x27;s untimely death in 1946 ended the development of the Telechrome system.

Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The Geer tube was similar to Baird&#x27;s concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird&#x27;s 3D patterning on a flat surface. The Penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The Chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.

====FCC color====
In the immediate post-war era, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was inundated with requests to set up new television stations. Worrying about congestion of the limited number of channels available, the FCC put a moratorium on all new licenses in 1948 while considering the problem. A solution was immediately forthcoming; rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use, and the FCC set aside a large section of these new UHF bands for television broadcast. At the time, black-and-white television broadcasting was still in its infancy in the U.S., and the FCC started to look at ways of using this newly available bandwidth for color broadcasts. Since no existing television would be able to tune in these stations, they were free to pick an incompatible system and allow the older VHF channels to die off over time.

The FCC called for technical demonstrations of color systems in 1948, and the Joint Technical Advisory Committee (JTAC) was formed to study them. CBS displayed improved versions of its original design, now using a single 6 MHz channel (like the existing black-and-white signals) at 144 fields per second and 405 lines of resolution. Color Television Inc. (CTI) demonstrated its line-sequential system, while Philco demonstrated a dot-sequential system based on its beam-index tube-based &quot;Apple&quot; tube technology. Of the entrants, the CBS system was by far the best-developed, and won head-to-head testing every time.

While the meetings were taking place it was widely known within the industry that RCA was working on a dot-sequential system that was compatible with existing black-and-white broadcasts, but RCA declined to demonstrate it during the first series of meetings. Just before the JTAC presented its findings, on 25 August 1949, RCA broke its silence and introduced its system as well. The JTAC still recommended the CBS system, and after the resolution of an ensuing RCA lawsuit, color broadcasts using the CBS system started on 25 June 1951. By this point the market had changed dramatically; when color was first being considered in 1948 there were fewer than a million television sets in the U.S., but by 1951 there were well over 10 million. The idea that the VHF band could be allowed to &quot;die&quot; was no longer practical.

During its campaign for FCC approval, CBS gave the first demonstrations of color television to the general public, showing an hour of color programs daily Mondays through Saturdays, beginning 12 January 1950, and running for the remainder of the month, over WOIC in Washington, D.C., where the programs could be viewed on eight 16-inch color receivers in a public building. Due to high public demand, the broadcasts were resumed 13–21 February, with several evening programs added. CBS initiated a limited schedule of color broadcasts from its New York station WCBS-TV Mondays to Saturdays beginning 14 November 1950, making ten color receivers available for the viewing public. All were broadcast using the single color camera that CBS owned. The New York broadcasts were extended by coaxial cable to Philadelphia&#x27;s WCAU-TV beginning 13 December, and to Chicago on 10 January, making them the first network color broadcasts.

After a series of hearings beginning in September 1949, the FCC found the RCA and CTI systems fraught with technical problems, inaccurate color reproduction, and expensive equipment, and so formally approved the CBS system as the U.S. color broadcasting standard on 11 October 1950. An unsuccessful lawsuit by RCA delayed the first commercial network broadcast in color until 25 June 1951, when a musical variety special titled simply &quot;Premiere&quot; was shown over a network of five East Coast CBS affiliates. Viewing was again restricted: the program could not be seen on black-and-white sets, and &quot;Variety&quot; estimated that only thirty prototype color receivers were available in the New York area. Regular color broadcasts began that same week with the daytime series &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; and &quot;Modern Homemakers&quot;.

While the CBS color broadcasting schedule gradually expanded to twelve hours per week (but never into prime time), and the color network expanded to eleven affiliates as far west as Chicago, its commercial success was doomed by the lack of color receivers necessary to watch the programs, the refusal of television manufacturers to create adapter mechanisms for their existing black-and-white sets, and the unwillingness of advertisers to sponsor broadcasts seen by almost no one. CBS had bought a television manufacturer in April, and in September 1951, production began on the only CBS-Columbia color television model, with the first color sets reaching retail stores on 28 September. However, it was too little, too late. Only 200 sets had been shipped, and only 100 sold, when CBS discontinued its color television system on 20 October 1951, ostensibly by request of the National Production Authority for the duration of the Korean War, and bought back all the CBS color sets it could to prevent lawsuits by disappointed customers. RCA chairman David Sarnoff later charged that the NPA&#x27;s order had come &quot;out of a situation artificially created by one company to solve its own perplexing problems&quot; because CBS had been unsuccessful in its color venture.

====Compatible color====

While the FCC was holding its JTAC meetings, development was taking place on a number of systems allowing true simultaneous color broadcasts, &quot;dot-sequential color systems&quot;. Unlike the hybrid systems, dot-sequential televisions used a signal very similar to existing black-and-white broadcasts, with the intensity of every dot on the screen being sent in succession.

In 1938 Georges Valensi demonstrated an encoding scheme that would allow color broadcasts to be encoded so they could be picked up on existing black-and-white sets as well. In his system the output of the three camera tubes were re-combined to produce a single &quot;luminance&quot; value that was very similar to a monochrome signal and could be broadcast on the existing VHF frequencies. The color information was encoded in a separate &quot;chrominance&quot; signal, consisting of two separate signals, the original blue signal minus the luminance (B&#x27;–Y&#x27;), and red-luma (R&#x27;–Y&#x27;). These signals could then be broadcast separately on a different frequency; a monochrome set would tune in only the luminance signal on the VHF band, while color televisions would tune in both the luminance and chrominance on two different frequencies, and apply the reverse transforms to retrieve the original RGB signal. The downside to this approach is that it required a major boost in bandwidth use, something the FCC was interested in avoiding.

RCA used Valensi&#x27;s concept as the basis of all of its developments, believing it to be the only proper solution to the broadcast problem. However, RCA&#x27;s early sets using mirrors and other projection systems all suffered from image and color quality problems, and were easily bested by CBS&#x27;s hybrid system. But solutions to these problems were in the pipeline, and RCA in particular was investing massive sums (later estimated at $100 million) to develop a usable dot-sequential tube. RCA was beaten to the punch by the Geer tube, which used three B&amp;W tubes aimed at different faces of colored pyramids to produce a color image. All-electronic systems included the Chromatron, Penetron and beam-index tube that were being developed by various companies. While investigating all of these, RCA&#x27;s teams quickly started focusing on the shadow mask system.

In July 1938 the shadow mask color television was patented by Werner Flechsig (1900–1981) in Germany, and was demonstrated at the International radio exhibition Berlin in 1939. Most CRT color televisions used today are based on this technology. His solution to the problem of focusing the electron guns on the tiny colored dots was one of brute-force; a metal sheet with holes punched in it allowed the beams to reach the screen only when they were properly aligned over the dots. Three separate guns were aimed at the holes from slightly different angles, and when their beams passed through the holes the angles caused them to separate again and hit the individual spots a short distance away on the back of the screen. The downside to this approach was that the mask cut off the vast majority of the beam energy, allowing it to hit the screen only 15% of the time, requiring a massive increase in beam power to produce acceptable image brightness.

The first publicly announced network demonstration of a program using a &quot;compatible color&quot; system was an episode of NBC&#x27;s Kukla, Fran and Ollie on 10 October 1949, viewable in color only at the FCC. It did not receive FCC approval.

In spite of these problems in both the broadcast and display systems, RCA pressed ahead with development and was ready for a second assault on the standards by 1950.

====Second NTSC====
The possibility of a compatible color broadcast system was so compelling that the NTSC decided to re-form, and held a second series of meetings starting in January 1950. Having only recently selected the CBS system, the FCC heavily opposed the NTSC&#x27;s efforts. One of the FCC Commissioners, R. F. Jones, went so far as to assert that the engineers testifying in favor of a compatible system were &quot;in a conspiracy against the public interest&quot;.

Unlike the FCC approach where a standard was simply selected from the existing candidates, the NTSC would produce a board that was considerably more pro-active in development.

Starting before CBS color even got on the air, the U.S. television industry, represented by the National Television System Committee, worked in 1950–1953 to develop a color system that was compatible with existing black-and-white sets and would pass FCC quality standards, with RCA developing the hardware elements. RCA first made publicly announced field tests of the dot sequential color system over its New York station WNBT in July 1951. When CBS testified before Congress in March 1953 that it had no further plans for its own color system, the National Production Authority dropped its ban on the manufacture of color television receivers, and the path was open for the NTSC to submit its petition for FCC approval in July 1953, which was granted on 17 December. The first publicly announced network demonstration of a program using the NTSC &quot;compatible color&quot; system was an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; on 30 August 1953, although it was viewable in color only at the network&#x27;s headquarters. The first network broadcast to go out over the air in NTSC color was a performance of the opera &quot;Carmen&quot; on 31 October 1953.

==Adoption==
===North America===

====Canada====
Colour broadcasts from the United States were available to Canadian population centres near the border from the mid-1950s. At the time that NTSC colour broadcasting was officially introduced into Canada in 1966, less than one percent of Canadian households had a colour television set. Colour television in Canada was launched on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (CBC) English language TV service on 1 September 1966. Private television broadcaster CTV also started colour broadcasts in early September 1966.
The CBC&#x27;s French-language service, Radio-Canada, was broadcasting colour programming on its television network for 15 hours a week in 1968. Full-time colour transmissions started in 1974 on the CBC, with other private sector broadcasters in the country doing so by the end of the 1970s.

The following provinces and areas of Canada introduced colour television by the years as stated
*Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec (1966; Major networks only – private sector around 1968 to 1972)
*Newfoundland and Labrador (1967)
*Nova Scotia, New Brunswick (1968)
*Prince Edward Island (1969)
*Yukon (1971)
*Northwest Territories (including Nunavut) (1972; Major networks in large centers, many remote areas in the far north did not get colour until at least 1977 and 1978)

====Cuba====
Cuba in 1958 became the second country in the world to introduce color television broadcasting, with Havana&#x27;s Channel 12 using the American NTSC standard and technology patented by RCA. But the color transmissions ended when broadcasting stations were seized in the Cuban Revolution in 1959, and did not return until 1975, using equipment acquired from Japan&#x27;s NEC Corporation, and SECAM equipment from the Soviet Union, adapted for the American NTSC standard.

====Mexico====
Guillermo González Camarena independently invented and developed a field-sequential tricolor disk system in Mexico in the late 1930s, for which he requested a patent in Mexico on 19 August 1940, and in the United States in 1941. González Camarena produced his color television system in his Gon-Cam laboratory for the Mexican market and exported it to the Columbia College of Chicago, which regarded it as the best system in the world. Goldmark had actually applied for a patent for the same field-sequential tricolor system in the US on 7 September 1940, while González Camarena had made his Mexican filing 19 days before, on 19 August.

On 31 August 1946, González Camarena sent his first color transmission from his lab in the offices of the Mexican League of Radio Experiments at Lucerna St. No. 1, in Mexico City. The video signal was transmitted at a frequency of 115 MHz and the audio in the 40-metre band. He obtained authorization to make the first publicly announced color broadcast in Mexico, on 8 February 1963, of the program &quot;Paraíso Infantil&quot; on Mexico City&#x27;s XHGC-TV, using the NTSC system that had by now been adopted as the standard for color programming.

González Camarena also invented the &quot;simplified Mexican color TV system&quot; as a much simpler and cheaper alternative to the NTSC system. Due to its simplicity, NASA used a modified version of the system in its Voyager mission of 1979, to take pictures and video of Jupiter.

====United States====
Although all-electronic color was introduced in the US in 1953, high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) occurred on 1 January 1954, but over the next dozen years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. In 1956, NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; became the first live network television series to present a majority of episodes in color. The CBS television production of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot; was broadcast live in color on 31 March 1957. It was their only musical written directly for television, and had the highest one-night number of viewers to date at 107 million. CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Big Record&quot;, starring pop vocalist Patti Page, in 1957–1958 became the first television show broadcast in color for an entire season. The production costs for these shows were greater than most movies were at the time, not only because of all the stars featured in the musical and on the hour-long variety extravaganza, but also due to the extremely high-intensity lighting and electronics required for the new RCA TK-41 cameras, which were the first practical color television cameras.

It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.

NBC&#x27;s pioneering coast-to-coast color broadcast of the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade was accompanied by public demonstrations given across the United States on prototype color receivers by manufacturers RCA, General Electric, Philco, Raytheon, Hallicrafters, Hoffman, Pacific Mercury, and others. Two days earlier, Admiral had demonstrated to its distributors the prototype of Admiral&#x27;s first color television set planned for consumer sale using the NTSC standards, priced at $1,175 (). It is not known when actual commercial sales of this receiver began. Production was extremely limited, and no advertisements for it were published in New York newspapers, nor those in Washington, DC.

A color model from Admiral C1617A became available in the Chicago area on 4 January 1954 and appeared in various stores throughout the country, including those in Maryland on 6 January 1954, San Francisco, 14 January 1954, Indianapolis on 17 January 1954, Pittsburgh on 25 January 1954, and Oakland on 26 January 1954, among other cities thereafter. A color model from Westinghouse H840CK15 ($1,295, or ) became available in the New York area on 28 February 1954; Only 30 sets were sold in its first month. A less expensive color model from RCA (CT-100) reached dealers in April 1954. Television&#x27;s first prime time network color series was &quot;The Marriage&quot;, a situation comedy broadcast live by NBC in the summer of 1954. NBC&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Ford Theatre&quot; became the first network color-filmed series that October; however, due to the high cost of the first fifteen color episodes, Ford ordered that two black-and-white episodes be filmed for every color episode. The first series to be filmed entirely in color was NBC&#x27;s &quot;Norby&quot;, a sitcom that lasted 13 weeks, from January to April 1955, and was replaced by repeats of &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;″s color episodes.

Early color telecasts could be preserved only on the black-and-white kinescope process introduced in 1947. It was not until September 1956 that NBC began using color film to time-delay and preserve some of its live color telecasts. Ampex introduced a color videotape recorder in 1958, which NBC used to tape &quot;An Evening with Fred Astaire&quot;, the oldest surviving network color videotape. This system was also used to unveil a demonstration of color television for the press. On 22 May 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower visited the WRC-TV NBC studios in Washington, D.C., and gave a speech touting the new technology&#x27;s merits. His speech was recorded in color, and a copy of this videotape was given to the Library of Congress for posterity.

The syndicated &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; had been filmed in color since 1949 in anticipation of color broadcasting. Several other syndicated shows had episodes filmed in color during the 1950s, including &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;, and &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;. The first was carried by some stations equipped for color telecasts well before NBC began its regular weekly color dramas in 1959, beginning with the Western series &quot;Bonanza&quot;.

NBC was at the forefront of color programming because its parent company RCA manufactured the most successful line of color sets in the 1950s and, at the end of August 1956, announced that in comparison with 1955–56 (when only three of its regularly scheduled programs were broadcast in color) the 1956–57 season would feature 17 series in color. By 1959 RCA was the only remaining major manufacturer of color sets, competitors having discontinued models that used RCA picture tubes because of poor sales, while working on their own improved tube designs. CBS and ABC, not affiliated with set manufacturers and not eager to promote their competitor&#x27;s product, were much slower to broadcast in color. CBS broadcast color specials and sometimes aired its big weekly variety shows in color, but it offered no regularly scheduled color programming until the fall of 1965. At least one CBS show, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, was filmed in color beginning in 1963, but continued to be telecast in black and white through the end of the 1964–65 season. ABC delayed its first color programs until 1962, but these were initially only broadcasts of the cartoon shows &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot; and &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;. The DuMont network, although it did have a television-manufacturing parent company, was in financial decline by 1954 and was dissolved two years later. The only known original color programming broadcast over the DuMont network was a high school football Thanksgiving game from New Jersey in 1957, a year after the network had ceased regular operations.

The relatively small amount of network color programming, combined with the high cost of color television sets, meant that as late as 1964 only 3.1 percent of television households in the US had a color set. However, by the mid-1960s, the subject of color programming turned into a ratings war. A 1965 American Research Bureau (ARB) study that proposed an emerging trend in color television set sales convinced NBC that a full shift to color would gain a ratings advantage over its two competitors. As a result, NBC provided the catalyst for rapid color expansion by announcing that its prime time schedule for fall 1965 would be almost entirely in color. ABC and CBS followed suit and over half of their combined prime-time programming also moved to color that season, but they were still reluctant to telecast all their programming in color due to production costs. All three broadcast networks were airing full color prime time schedules by the 1966–67 broadcast season, and ABC aired its last new black-and-white daytime programming in December 1967. Public broadcasting networks like NET, however, did not use color for a majority of their programming until 1968. The number of color television sets sold in the US did not exceed black-and-white sales until 1972, which was also the first year that more than fifty percent of television households in the US had a color set. This was also the year that &quot;in color&quot; notices before color television programs ended, due to the rise in color television set sales, and color programming having become the norm.

In a display of foresight, Disney had filmed many of its earlier shows in color so they were able to be repeated on NBC, and since most of Disney&#x27;s feature-length films were also made in color, they could now also be telecast in that format. To emphasize the new feature, the series was re-dubbed &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;, which premiered in September 1961, and retained that moniker until 1969.

By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and by the early 1980s, B&amp;W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. These black-and-white displays were still compatible with color signals and remained usable through the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st Century for uses that did not require a full color display. The digital television transition in the United States in 2009 rendered the remaining black-and-white television sets obsolete; all digital television receivers are capable of displaying full color.

Color broadcasting in Hawaii started on 5 May 1957. One of the last television stations in North America to convert to color, WQEX (now WINP-TV) in Pittsburgh, started broadcasting in color on 16 October 1986, after its black-and-white transmitter, which dated from the 1950s, broke down in February 1985 and the parts required to fix it were no longer available. The owner of WQEX, PBS member station WQED, used some of its pledge money to buy a color transmitter.

Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice, they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of GE&#x27;s relatively compact and lightweight Porta-Color set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, the year sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.

===Europe===
The first two color television broadcasts in Europe were made by early tests in France (SECAM) between 1963 and 1966, then officially launched in October 1967 and by the UK&#x27;s BBC2 beginning on 1 July 1967 and West Germany&#x27;s Das Erste and ZDF in August, both using the PAL system. They were followed by the Netherlands in September (PAL). On 1 October 1968, the first scheduled television program in color was broadcast in Switzerland. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Austria, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary all started regular color broadcasts around 1969–1970. Ireland&#x27;s national TV station RTÉ began using color in 1968 for recorded programs; the first outside broadcast made in color for RTÉ Television was when Ireland hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin in 1971. The PAL system spread through most of Western Europe.

More European countries introduced color television using the PAL system in the 1970s and early 1980s; examples include Belgium (1971), Bulgaria (1971, but not fully implemented until 1972), SFR Yugoslavia (1971), Spain (1972, but not fully implemented until 1977), Iceland (1973, but not fully implemented until 1976), Portugal (1975, but not fully implemented until 1980), Albania (1981), Turkey (1981) and Romania (1983, but not fully implemented until 1985–1991). In Italy there were debates to adopt a national color television system, the &quot;ISA&quot;, developed by Indesit, but that idea was scrapped. As a result, and after a test during the 1972 Summer Olympics, Italy was one of the last European countries to officially adopt the PAL system in the 1976–1977 season.

France, Luxembourg, and most of the Eastern Bloc along with their overseas territories opted for SECAM. SECAM was a popular choice in countries with much hilly terrain, and countries with a very large installed base of older monochrome equipment, which could cope much better with the greater ruggedness of the SECAM signal. However, for many countries the decision was more down to politics than technical merit.

A drawback of SECAM for production is that, unlike PAL or NTSC, certain post-production operations of encoded SECAM signals are not really possible without a significant drop in quality. As an example, a simple fade to black is trivial in NTSC and PAL: one merely reduces the signal level until it is zero. However, in SECAM the color difference signals, which are frequency modulated, need first to be decoded to e.g. RGB, then the fade-to-black is applied, and finally the resulting signal is re-encoded into SECAM. Because of this, much SECAM video editing was actually done using PAL equipment, then the resultant signal was converted to SECAM. Another drawback of SECAM is that comb filtering, allowing better color separation, is of limited use in SECAM receivers. This was not, however, much of a drawback in the early days of SECAM as such filters were not readily available in high-end TV sets before the 1990s.

The first regular color broadcasts in SECAM were started on 1 October 1967, on France&#x27;s Second Channel (ORTF 2e chaîne).
In France and the UK color broadcasts were made on 625-line UHF frequencies, the VHF band being used for black and white, 405 lines in UK or 819 lines in France, until the beginning of the 1980s. Countries elsewhere that were already broadcasting 625-line monochrome on VHF and UHF, simply transmitted color programs on the same channels.

Some British television programs, particularly those made by or for ITC Entertainment, were shot on color film before the introduction of color television to the UK, for the purpose of sales to US networks. The first British show to be made in color was the drama series &quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot; (1956–57), which was initially made in black and white but later shot in color for sale to the NBC network in the United States. Other British color television programs made before the introduction of color television in the UK include &quot;Stingray&quot; (1964–1965), which was claimed to be the first British TV show to be filmed entirely in color, although when this claim was made in the 1960s it was protested by Francis Coudrill who said his series &quot;The Stoopendus Adventures of Hank&quot; had been shot entirely in color some years previously; &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (1965–1966), &quot;The Baron&quot; (1966–1967), &quot;The Saint&quot; (from 1966 to 1969), &quot;The Avengers&quot; (from 1967 to 1969), &quot;Man in a Suitcase&quot; (1967–1968), &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967–1968) and &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; (1967–1968). However, most UK series predominantly made using videotape, such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1963–89; 2005–present) did not begin color production until later, with the first color &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes not airing until 1970. (The first four, comprising the story &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, were shot on film owing to a technician&#x27;s strike, with videotape being used thereafter). Although marginal, some UK viewers are still using black and white tv sets. The number of black and white licenses issued was 212000 in 2000 and 6586 in 2019.

The last country in Europe to introduce color television was Romania in 1983.

===Asia and the Pacific===
In Japan, NHK and NTV introduced color television, using a variation of the NTSC system (called NTSC-J) on 10 September 1960, making it the first country in Asia to introduce color television. The Philippines (1966) and Taiwan (1969) also adopted the NTSC system.

Other countries in the region instead used the PAL system, starting with Australia (1974, originally scheduled for 1972 and tested in 1967, but not fully implemented until 1975–1978), and then Thailand (1967–69; this country converted from 525-line NTSC to 625-line PAL), Hong Kong (1967–70), the People&#x27;s Republic of China (1970, but not fully implemented until 1984), New Zealand (1973), North Korea (1974), Singapore (1974), Indonesia (1974, but not fully implemented until 1979–82), Pakistan (1976, but not fully implemented until 1982), Kazakhstan (1977), Vietnam (1977), Malaysia (1978, but not fully implemented until 1980), India (1979, but not fully implemented until 1982–86), Burma (1980), and Bangladesh (1980). South Korea did not introduce color television (using NTSC) until 1980–1981, although it was already manufacturing color television sets for export. The last country in Asia and the world to introduce color television was Cambodia in 1986.

====China====
The People&#x27;s Republic of China began plans and early testing for color TV as early as 1960, but were quickly cancelled.

China started testing again in 1970 and adopted PAL the next year. 
Regular full-time color broadcasts on what is now CCTV-2 since October 1973, and full-time color transmissions for the CCTV&#x27;s then-two channels since July 1977.

The following provinces and areas of China introduced color television by the years as stated:

* Beijing (1973)
* Shanghai (1974)
* Guangdong (1976)
* Jilin (1977)
* Fujian and Hainan (1978)
* Inner Mongolia (1979)
* Ningxia (1980)
* Anhui, Chongqing, Gansu, Heilionjiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shandong and Shanxi (1981)
* Xinjiang (1982, peripheral in 1984) 
* Henan (1983)

====Middle East====
Nearly all of the countries in the Middle East use PAL. The first country in the Middle East to introduce color television was Lebanon in 1967. Jordan, Iraq and Oman, become second in the early-1970s. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar followed in the mid-1970s, but Israel and Cyprus continued to broadcast in black and white until the early 1980s. Israeli television even erased the color signals using a device called the &quot;mehikon&quot;.

===Africa===
The first color television service in Africa was introduced on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar, in 1973, using PAL. In 1973 also, MBC of Mauritius broadcast the OCAMM Conference, in color, using SECAM. At the time, South Africa did not have a television service at all, owing to opposition from the apartheid regime, but in 1976, one was finally launched. Nigeria adopted PAL for color transmissions in 1974 in the Benue Plateau state in the north central region of the country, but countries such as Seychelles continued with black and white until 1985 respectively. The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service (SLBS) started television broadcasting in 1963 as a cooperation between the SLBS and commercial interests; coverage was extended to all districts in 1978 when the service was also upgraded to color.

Therefore, the list of the countries in color TV in Africa:

The last country in Africa to introduce color television was Seychelles in 1985.

===South America===
Unlike most other countries in the Americas, which had adopted NTSC, Brazil began broadcasting in color using PAL-M, on 19 February 1972. Ecuador was the first South American country to broadcast in color using NTSC, on 5 November 1974. In 1978, Argentina started international broadcasting in color using PAL-B in connection with the country&#x27;s hosting of the FIFA World Cup. However domestic color broadcasting remained black &amp; white until 1 May 1980 when regular broadcasting started using PAL-N, a variation of PAL-B specially suited for Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.

Also in April 1978, Chile adopted color television officially through the NTSC standard, This led to experimental broadcasts during the Viña del Mar Festival and the widespread use of color TV during the 1978 FIFA World Cup, followed by the charity event Teletón in December of the same year.

Some other countries in South America, including Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay [1981], did not broadcast full-time color television until the early 1980s.

Cor Dillen, director and later CEO of the South American branch of Philips, was responsible for bringing color television to South America.

==Color standards==
There are three main analog broadcast television systems in use around the world, PAL (Phase Alternating Line), NTSC (National Television Standards Committee), and SECAM (Séquentiel Couleur à Mémoire—Sequential Color with Memory).

The system used in The Americas and part of the Far East is NTSC. Most of Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Africa, and Eastern South America use PAL (though Brazil and Cambodia uses a hybrid PAL-M system). Eastern Europe and France uses SECAM. Generally, a device (such as a television) can only read or display video encoded to a standard that the device is designed to support; otherwise, the source must be converted (such as when European programs are broadcast in North America or vice versa).

This table illustrates the differences:
[1] For SECAM the color sub-carrier alternates between 4.25000 MHz for the lines containing the Db color signal and 4.40625 MHz for the Dr signal (both are frequency modulated unlike both PAL and NTSC, which are phase modulated). The frequency of the sub-carrier is the only means that the decoder has of determining which color difference signal is actually being transmitted.

Digital television broadcasting standards, such as ATSC, DVB-T, DVB-T2, and ISDB, have superseded these analog transmission standards in many countries.

<text>Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres (22 November 1721 – 27 October 1824) was a Canadian cartographer who served in the Seven Years&#x27; War, as the aide-de-camp to General James Wolfe. 

DesBarres is perhaps best known as the creator the monumental four-volume &quot;Atlantic Neptune&quot;, the most important collection of maps, charts and views of North America published in the eighteenth century. He later went on to serve as the Lieutenant-Governor of Cape Breton Colony and later as Lieutenant-Governor of Prince Edward Island.

Colonel DesBarres is buried with his wife under St. George&#x27;s (Round) Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia.

==Early life==

DesBarres, who is seen as having lived through important changes in Nova Scotia&#x27;s history, is thought to have been born in Basel, Switzerland (although Montbéliard has also been suggested), and was a member of a Huguenot family. His parents were Joseph-Leonard Vallet DesBarres and Anne-Catherine Cuvier and he was the eldest of their three children. DesBarres read mathematics and art at the University of Basel, studying under John and Daniel Bernoulli. Upon the completion of his studies he left for England. There he enrolled at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. It was there that DesBarres trained to become a military officer, and studied military surveying. His training would also benefit him later in life for surveying, map making, and coastal charting. In 1756 he was commissioned into the Royal Americans (the 62nd Foot later known as the 60th Foot).

===Seven Years&#x27; War===
In 1756 DesBarres sailed to North America and was with Edward Boscawen&#x27;s fleet when it attacked the Fortress of Louisbourg in 1758. He distinguished himself by capturing a French entrenchment at Kennington Cove. Soon he was put to work charting the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the approaches to Quebec, information that would be used the following year in James Wolfe&#x27;s assault on the City of Quebec. In 1760 he was at Halifax to prepare plans for the city&#x27;s defences and naval yard.

Jonathan Binney and DesBarres met the Mi&#x27;kmaw chiefs at Arichat, Nova Scotia, in 1761, and concluded a lasting peace.

By 1762 he was sent to Newfoundland to survey Harbour Grace and Carbonear and to draw up plans for new harbour defences to replace those destroyed by the French. James Cook was sent as his assistant. (DesBarres may have met Cook earlier at either Louisbourg or Halifax.)

==Castle Frederick==
DesBarres established an estate at Falmouth, Nova Scotia, known as Castle Frederick, which served as his base of operations from 1764 until he returned to England in 1773. The 1770 Nova Scotia census indicates Castle Frederick had a staff of 41 men, 13 women, 5 boys, and 33 girls. One of the women, Mary Cannon, served as housekeeper and manager of Castle Frederick from 1764 to 1794. She also administered tenant farmers on DesBarres&#x27; land holdings of in Tatamagouche, in New Brunswick and approximately in Maccan, Nappan, and Minudie. His Tatamagouche holdings formed the western coastal boundary of the Philadelphia grant.

==Atlantic Neptune==

DesBarres made many maps of the Atlantic, mapping the coast of North American from Newfoundland to New York. His survey of the coast of Nova Scotia took approximately ten years due its length and intricacy. DesBarres was exasperated with the work, stating &quot;There is scarcely any known shore so much intersected with Bays, Harbours, and Creeks as this is&quot; &quot;and the Offing of it is so full of Islands, Rocks, and Shoals as are almost innumerable.&quot; The survey work was carried out in the summer and in the winter he would retire to Castle Frederick to complete his charts and drawings. His most notable work is the &quot;Atlantic Neptune&quot;. In 1774 under direction for the British Admiralty, DesBarres compiled and edited his and many others&#x27; charts and maps of eastern North America. The completed work was published in 1777, having cost the Admiralty an estimated £100,000.

== Governor ==

To accommodate the arrival of the United Empire Loyalists, Cape Breton was created as a separate colony from Nova Scotia (as was New Brunswick) and DesBarres served as the lieutenant governor of Cape Breton from 1784 to 1787. He laid out the original plan of the capital, Sydney. He was later governor of Prince Edward Island from 1804 to 1812. Dalhousie University has a number of items of Colonel DesBarres in one of its archive collections.

He died at the age of 102, and his date of death is variously given as 24 and 27 October. Colonel DesBarres is buried St. George&#x27;s (Round) Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia. While he was buried beside his wife Martha, he was survived by his mistress Mary Cannon and their four children. His funeral took place in St. George&#x27;s (Round) Church in 1824.

<doc id="162852" wikidata="Q3007290" url="?curid=162852" title="Culture of New Zealand">
<text>The culture of New Zealand is a synthesis of indigenous Māori, colonial British, and other cultural influences. The country&#x27;s earliest inhabitants brought with them customs and language from Polynesia, and during the centuries of isolation, developed their own Māori and Moriori cultures. British colonists in the 19th century brought Western culture and had a dramatic effect on the indigenous inhabitants, spreading Western religious traditions and the English language. Over time, a distinct Pākehā or New Zealand European culture emerged. 

More recent immigration from the Pacific, East Asia, and South Asia has added to the cultural diversity in New Zealand. The dominant cultural influence in New Zealand remains Western, with a strong focus on democracy and egalitarianism. Māori culture continues to be an essential part of the national identity, with ongoing efforts to recognise and honour the Māori language and Māori traditions.

Ministry for Culture and Heritage showed &#x27;that the arts and creative sector contributed $14.9 billion to New Zealand&#x27;s GDP for the year ending March 2022&#x27;, this is 4.2% of the total economy and is the highest since 2000 when recording began. As of March 2022, 115,000 people were primarily employed in the creative sector (32% self-employed).

==Cultural history==

Polynesian explorers reached the islands between 1250 and 1300. Over the ensuing centuries of Polynesian expansion and settlement, Māori culture developed from its Polynesian roots. Māori established separate tribes, built fortified villages (), hunted and fished, traded commodities, developed agriculture, arts and weaponry, and kept a detailed oral history. At some point, a group of Māori migrated to , now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori culture. Regular European contact began from 1800, and British immigration proceeded rapidly, especially from 1855. European colonists had a dramatic effect on the Māori, bringing Christianity, advanced technology, the English language, numeracy and literacy. In 1840 Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, intended to enable the tribes to live peacefully with the colonists. However, after several incidents, the New Zealand Wars broke out from 1845, with Māori suffering a loss of land, partly through confiscation, but mainly through widespread and extensive land sales. Māori retained their identity, mostly choosing to live separately from settlers and continuing to speak and write . With mass migration from Europe, a high Māori death rate and low life expectancy for Māori women, the indigenous population figure dropped between 1850 and 1930, becoming a minority.
European New Zealanders (Pākehā), despite their location far from Europe, retained strong cultural ties to &quot;Mother England&quot;. These ties were weakened by the demise of the British Empire and loss of special access to British meat and dairy markets. Pākehā began to forge a separate identity influenced by their pioneering history, a rural lifestyle and New Zealand&#x27;s unique environment. Pākehā culture became prevalent after the wars, but after sustained political efforts, biculturalism and the Treaty of Waitangi became part of the school curriculum in the late 20th century, to promote understanding between Māori and Pākehā.

More recently, New Zealand culture has been broadened by globalisation and immigration from the Pacific Islands, East Asia and South Asia. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are apparent, with Pasifika, the world&#x27;s largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.

The development of a New Zealand identity and national character, separate from the British colonial identity, is most often linked with the period surrounding World War I, which gave rise to the concept of the Anzac spirit. Many citizens prefer to minimise ethnic divisions, simply calling themselves New Zealanders or, informally, &quot;Kiwis&quot;. 
New Zealand marks two national days of remembrance, Waitangi Day and Anzac Day, and also celebrates holidays during or close to the anniversaries of the founding dates of each province.

==New Zealand European culture==
Pākehā culture (usually synonymous with New Zealand European culture) derives mainly from that of the European (mostly British) settlers who colonised New Zealand in the 19th century. Europeans migrated to New Zealand in increasing numbers from 1855. The Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 formed the basis of the establishment of British rule in New Zealand. New Zealand became partly self-governing in 1852 with the establishment of its own Parliament. There was conflict between Māori and European settlers especially between 1863 and 1864 which resulted in land being confiscated from the defeated tribes.

Until about the 1950s many Pākehā saw themselves as British people, and retained strong cultural ties to &quot;Mother England&quot;. Yet there was a common perception that people born in New Zealand were likely to be physically stronger and more adaptable than people in Britain. The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged, industrious problem solvers. Another distinctive trait of Pākehā culture has been the egalitarian tradition, as opposed to the British class system. Within Pākehā culture there are also sub-cultures derived from Irish, Italian and other European groups, as well as various non-ethnic subcultures.

One of the goals of Pākehā anti-racist groups of the 1980s was to enable Pākehā to see their own culture as such, rather than thinking what they did was normal and what other people did was &#x27;ethnic&#x27; and strange. Some argue that belief in the &#x27;absence&#x27; of culture in New Zealand is a symptom of white privilege, allowing members of a dominant group to see their culture as &#x27;normal&#x27; or &#x27;default&#x27;, rather than as a specific position of relative advantage.

From the 1980s Pākehā began to further explore their distinctive traditions and to argue that New Zealanders had a culture which was neither Māori nor British. There was an interest in &quot;Kiwiana&quot;—items from New Zealand&#x27;s heritage that are seen as representing iconic Kiwi elements, such as the pōhutukawa (New Zealand Christmas tree), pāua-shell ash-tray, Buzzy Bee, Pineapple Lumps, gumboots and jandals.

==Māori culture==

The Māori are the indigenous inhabitants of New Zealand. They originated settlers from eastern Polynesian islands, who arrived in New Zealand in several waves of canoe voyages at some time between 1250 and 1300. Māori settled the islands and developed a distinct culture over several hundred years. Oral history tells of a long voyage from Hawaiki (the mythical homeland in tropical Polynesia) in large ocean-going canoes (). Māori mythology is a distinctive corpus of gods and heroes, sharing some Polynesian motifs. Significant figures are Ranginui and Papatūānuku, Māui, and Kupe.

Central to many cultural events is the , where families and tribes gather for special occasions, such as pōwhiri or tangi. Māori often call themselves &quot;tangata whenua&quot; (people of the land), placing particular importance on a lifestyle connected to land and sea.

The distinct values, history, and worldview of Māori are expressed through traditional arts and skills such as , , (music), carving, weaving, and poi. The concept of tapu (meaning taboo or sacred) is also a strong force in Māori culture, applied to objects, people, or even mountains.

==Other ethnic cultures==

Ethnic communities within New Zealand retain features of their own cultures, and these have, in some areas, spread to become popular with the general population. Settler groups from many cultures added to the make-up of the country, with many groups concentrated around specific geographic areas. These include Dalmatian settlers in Northland, Danish settlers in inland Hawke&#x27;s Bay, and Southern Chinese and Levantine settlers in Otago. These added to larger-scale Pākehā settlement which itself varied between English settlers (e.g., in Canterbury), Irish settlers (e.g., on the South Island West Coast), and Scottish settlers (e.g., in Otago and Southland).

From the mid-20th century on, waves of immigrants have entered the country from different ethnic backgrounds, notable Dutch and central Europeans during the 1950s, Pacific Islanders since the 1960s, and northern Chinese, Indians, and southeast Asians since the 1980s. Various aspects of each culture have added to New Zealand culture; Chinese New Year is celebrated for example, especially in Auckland and Dunedin, and South Auckland has strong Samoan cultural links. To celebrate its diverse Pacific cultures, the Auckland region hosts several Pacific Island festivals. Two of the major ones are Polyfest, which showcases performances of the secondary school cultural groups in the Auckland region, and Pasifika, a festival that celebrates Pacific island heritage through traditional food, music, dance, and entertainment.

The popular music style of Urban Pasifika also has its origins in the New Zealand Pacific Island community, and has become a major strand in New Zealand music culture. The annual Pacific Music Awards recognise the contribution to New Zealand music made by Pacific Island musicians and musical styles. Pacific island heritage is also celebrated in much of New Zealand&#x27;s fine art, with notable artists such as Fatu Feu&#x27;u, Lily Laita, John Pule, Yuki Kihara, and Michel Tuffery.

==Languages==

New Zealand has three official languages. English is the primary official language with its use unrestricted anywhere. The Māori language and New Zealand Sign Language also have official status in certain contexts, as defined by their respective statutes. Other languages are also spoken in New Zealand.

===New Zealand English===

New Zealand English is close to Australian English in pronunciation, but has several differences often overlooked by people from outside these countries. The most prominent differences between the New Zealand English dialect and other English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels: the short-&quot;i&quot; sound (as in &quot;kit&quot;) has centralised towards the schwa sound (the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;comma&quot; and &quot;about&quot;); the short-&quot;e&quot; sound (as in &quot;dress&quot;) has moved towards the short-&quot;i&quot; sound; and the short-&quot;a&quot; sound (as in &quot;trap&quot;) has moved to the short-&quot;e&quot; sound. Some of these differences show New Zealand English to have more affinity with the English of southern England than Australian English does. Several of the differences also show the influence of Māori speech. The New Zealand accent also has some Scottish and Irish influences from the large number of settlers from those places during the 19th century. At the time of the 2013 census, English was spoken by 96.1% of the total population.

===Te reo Māori===
An Eastern Polynesian language, is closely related to Tahitian and Cook Islands Māori; slightly less closely to Hawaiian and Marquesan; and more distantly to the languages of Western Polynesia, including Samoan, Niuean and Tongan. The Māori language went into decline in terms of use following European colonisation, but since the 1970s efforts have been made to reverse this trend. These include the granting of official language status through the Māori Language Act 1987, a Māori language week and a Māori television channel. The 2013 census found that Māori was spoken by 3.7% of the population. Beginning in about 2015, the language underwent a revival as it became increasingly popular, as a common national heritage and shared cultural identity, even among New Zealanders without Māori roots. Surveys from 2018 indicated that &quot;the Māori language currently enjoys a high status in Māori society and also positive acceptance by the majority of non-Māori New Zealanders&quot;.

There are distinct dialects of te reo Māori, &#x27;mita&#x27;.
* In Northland with Ngāpuhi, instead of hearing whakarongo, to listen – with a sharp &quot;F&quot; sound at the beginning – you are more likely to hear it being pronounced as &quot;hakarongo&quot;.
* Tūhoe speakers change the &quot;ng&quot; sound into an &quot;n&quot; sound and whakarongo becomes &quot;whakarono&quot;.
* Ngāi Tahu – Kai Tahu – in the South Island change the &quot;ng&quot; sound into a &quot;k&quot; sound and it becomes: &quot;whakaroko&quot;.
* In Whanganui/Taranaki, the &quot;wh&quot; sound becomes a glottal stop – where the &quot;h&quot; is lost altogether, so whakarongo becomes: &quot;w&#x27;akarongo&quot;. (Michael Neilson, The Herald 2020)
===New Zealand Sign Language===
New Zealand Sign Language has its roots in British Sign Language (BSL), and may be technically considered a dialect of British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language (BANZSL). There are 62.5% similarities found in British Sign Language and NZSL, compared with 33% of NZSL signs found in American Sign Language. Like other natural sign languages, it was devised by and for Deaf people, with no linguistic connection to a spoken or written language, and it is fully capable of expressing anything a fluent signer wants to say. It uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than BSL, reflecting New Zealand&#x27;s history of oralist education of deaf people. Its vocabulary includes Māori concepts such as marae and tangi, and signs for New Zealand placenames. New Zealand Sign Language became an official language of New Zealand in April 2006. About 20,000 people use New Zealand Sign Language.

===Other languages===
According to the 2013 census, 174 languages are used in New Zealand (including sign languages). As recorded in the 2013 census, Samoan is the most widely spoken non-official language (2.2%), followed by Hindi (1.7%), &quot;Northern Chinese&quot; (including Mandarin, 1.3%) and French (1.2%).

==National symbols==

New Zealand&#x27;s national symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and Māori sources. New Zealand&#x27;s location in the Southern Hemisphere was symbolised by the Southern Cross constellation in both the United Tribes&#x27; Flag (the first national flag, adopted in 1834) and the current national flag of New Zealand (since 1902). The silver fern is an emblem appearing on army insignia and sporting team uniforms, and various silver fern flags have been proposed as an alternative national flag.

Royal symbols of the monarchy of New Zealand continue to be featured in, for example, the coat of arms, the Defence Force, and the prefix His Majesty&#x27;s New Zealand Ship.

The flightless kiwi has been used as a symbol of New Zealand since the early 1900s. For example, in 1905 &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; printed a cartoon of a kiwi and a kangaroo (representing Australia) going off to a colonial conference. Today &quot;Kiwi&quot; is a nickname for New Zealanders.

New Zealand has two national anthems of equal status, &quot;God Save the King&quot; and &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot; – the latter of which is often sung with alternating Māori and English verses.

==Arts==

The definition of the arts by the New Zealand government covers six areas, visual arts, craft and object art, performing arts, literature, Pacific arts and Ngā toi Māori (Māori arts). Government funding is provided principally through, Creative New Zealand. Heritage New Zealand and the Ministry for Culture and Heritage are national bodies that assist with heritage preservation. Most towns and cities have museums and often art galleries, and the national museum and art gallery is Te Papa (&#x27;Our Place&#x27;), in Wellington.

Film, television and broadcasting has other government initiatives. 

=== Kapa haka ===

Kapa haka, (kapa means &#x27;rank&#x27; or &#x27;row&#x27;) is an expression of Māori cultural identity in song and dance. There is a national biennial kapa haka competition Te Matatini with regional and schools competitions too. Kapa haka is used in many state occasions and to represent New Zealand. Haka is part of kapa haka and is often mistaken as being always a warrior challenge. It is well-known as being performed by the New Zealand rugby team the All Blacks before matches.

===Visual arts===
When settlers arrived, they brought with them Western artistic traditions. Early European art focused mainly on landscape painting, although some of the best known European artists of the 19th century (Charles Goldie and Gottfried Lindauer) specialised in Māori portraiture. Some Māori adopted Western styles and a number of 19th-century meeting houses feature walls painted with portraits and plant designs. From the early-20th-century Āpirana Ngata and others began a programme of reviving traditional Māori arts, and many new meeting houses were built with traditional carving and tukutuku woven wall panels were built.

A longstanding concern of Pākehā artists has been the creation of a distinctly New Zealand artistic style. Rita Angus and others used the landscape to try to achieve this while painters such as Gordon Walters used Māori motifs. A number of Māori artists, including Paratene Matchitt and Shane Cotton have combined Western modernism with traditional Māori art.

A 2021 portraiture award and touring exhibition the Kiingi Tuheitia Portraiture Award has the intention of showcasing emerging Māori artists and recording sharing stories of ancestors.

===Architecture===
Māori initially built semi-permanent wooden structures, and then from the 15th century onwards as Māori settled they built more permanent structures, including &#x27;pātaka (storehouses), and kāuta (cooking houses)&#x27;. The that are seen today were developed in the mid-19th century. The contemporary architecture of New Zealand is influenced by various cultures but it is predominantly of a European style. 
Fatal earthquakes have influenced the built landscape of New Zealand, including less brick buildings and more wooden building in Wellington after a severe earthquake in 1855 early on in the British settlement. The 2010–11 Christchurch earthquakes have changed building approaches across New Zealand towards steel frame buildings especially in Christchurch and Wellington. Napier suffered an earthquake in 1931 creating an art deco re-build.Nowhere else in the world will you find as immense a collection of Art Deco architecture in such a small space. (Sally Jackson, 2016)

===Performing arts===
====Screen====

New Zealand is grappling with the effect of international streaming platforms in the New Zealand market. In 2023 the New Zealand&#x27;s screen producers&#x27; guild, SPADA pointed out international streamers currently &#x27;pay no tax in New Zealand, face no regulation, and use broadband infrastructure partially funded by our Government while at the same time impact local broadcasting viewership and advertising revenue&#x27;. Regulating this would be in-line with many other countries. 

The number of New Zealand films significantly increased during the 1970s. The highest-grossing New Zealand films are &quot;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&quot;, &quot;Boy&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Indian&quot;, &quot;Whale Rider&quot;, &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot; and &quot;The Piano&quot;. The country&#x27;s diverse scenery and compact size, plus government incentives, have encouraged some producers to shoot big-budget productions in New Zealand, including &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film trilogies, &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Wolverine&quot; and &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;.

==== Stage ====
There are a number of producing theatre companies in cities and towns and many regular arts festivals across New Zealand in the cities including the New Zealand Festival and Auckland Arts Festival, and smaller places like Hawkes Bay and Nelson. Roger Hall and Jacob Rajan are two playwrights to achieve considerable popular success writing New Zealand stories. 

====Music====

New Zealand music has been influenced by blues, jazz, country, rock and roll and hip hop, with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation. Hip-hop is popular and there are small but thriving live music, dance party and indie music scenes. Reggae is also popular within some communities, with bands such as Herbs, Katchafire, 1814, House Of Shem, Unity Pacific all reflecting their roots, perspectives and cultural pride and heritage through their music.

A number of popular artists have gone on to achieve international success including Lorde, Split Enz, Crowded House, OMC, Bic Runga, Kimbra, Ladyhawke, The Naked and Famous, Fat Freddy&#x27;s Drop, Savage, Alien Weaponry, Flight of the Conchords, and Brooke Fraser.

New Zealand has a national orchestra and many regional orchestras
. A number of New Zealand composers have developed international reputations. The most well-known include Douglas Lilburn, John Psathas, Jack Body, Gillian Whitehead, Jenny McLeod, Gareth Farr, Ross Harris, and Martin Lodge.

====Comedy====

In recent decades New Zealand comics have risen in popularity and recognition. In the 1970s and 1980s Billy T James satirized race relations, and McPhail &amp; Gadsby lampooned political figures, especially Robert Muldoon. John Clarke aka Fred Dagg joked about rural life. From the 1990s onwards the Naked Samoans expressed humour relating to their experiences as Pasifika in New Zealand, who started out doing theatre and have created been part of films including &quot;Sione&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. Raybon Kan is a prominent Asian comic and columnist. The Topp Twins are an off-beat comic/country music duo, and Flight of the Conchords have gained a cult following throughout the English-speaking world for their self-effacing show.

==Literature==
Pre-European Māori culture had a strong oral tradition of myths, legends, poetry, songs (waiata), and prayers. Early Pākehā writers wrote for a British audience, and described their experiences travelling and exploring New Zealand. A distinct New Zealand English literary culture only emerged in the early 20th century, initially with works inspired by Māori traditions and legends. Some New Zealand writers began to build a reputation, most notably short-story writer Katherine Mansfield.

From the 1940s, New Zealand literature began to develop into its own unique style, with writers such as short-story writer Frank Sargeson, novelist Janet Frame and poet Allen Curnow achieving critical and popular success in the mid-20th century. Publishing outlets for New Zealand writers such as &quot;Landfall&quot;, the &quot;New Zealand School Journal&quot; and bilingual quarterly &quot;Te Ao Hou / The New World&quot; also developed in this period. Since the mid-1950s Māori writing in New Zealand has flourished, with internationally recognised writers including poet Hone Tuwhare, novelists Alan Duff, Keri Hulme (author of &quot;the bone people&quot; (1984), the first New Zealand novel to win a Booker Prize), Patricia Grace and Witi Ihimaera, and short story writer Jacquie Sturm. New Zealand literature also has a close connection with Pasifika literature, and notable Pasifika writers include Albert Wendt, Alistair Te Ariki Campbell and Karlo Mila.
New Zealand fiction has grown exponentially since the mid-1970s, with notable contemporary novelists including Elizabeth Knox, Lloyd Jones and Eleanor Catton. Children&#x27;s authors Margaret Mahy and Joy Cowley have made a significant contribution to New Zealand children&#x27;s literature, and for older readers authors like Maurice Gee, Jack Lasenby and Tessa Duder have written books ranging from fantasy to social realism.

New Zealand has a strong poetic tradition; poets like James K. Baxter, Fleur Adcock and C.K. Stead emerged in the 1950s with a focus on New Zealand national identity, and were followed in later decades by poets influenced by American culture and more interested in personal relationships such as Bill Manhire, Sam Hunt and Elizabeth Smither. Modern New Zealand poetry is diverse in scope and themes, and notable contemporary poets include Tusiata Avia, Selina Tusitala Marsh and Hinemoana Baker.

==Sports==
The sports that most New Zealanders participate in are rugby union, cricket, basketball, netball, association football (the most popular sport amongst children), rugby league and hockey. Also popular are golf, tennis, cycling and a variety of water sports, particularly sailing and rowing. The country is known for its extreme sports, adventure tourism and strong mountaineering tradition, as seen in the success of notable New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary.

The national rugby union team is called the All Blacks and has the best winning record of any national team in the world, including being the inaugural winners of the World Cup in 1987. The style of name has been followed in naming the national team in several other sports. For instance, the nation&#x27;s basketball team is known as the Tall Blacks.

Horseracing was also a popular spectator sport and became part of the &quot;rugby, racing and beer&quot; culture during the 1960s. Many New Zealanders either play or support their local rugby team and the All Blacks are national icons. Some have argued that rugby is a national religion.

==Religion==

Pre-colonial native Māori religion was animistic. One of its major features was tapu (sacred and/or forbidden), which was used to maintain the status of chiefs and tohunga (priests) and also for purposes such as conserving resources. Some of the earliest European settlers in New Zealand were Christian missionaries, mostly from the Church of England but also from Protestant denominations and the Catholic Church. From the 1830s onwards, large numbers of Māori converted. Throughout the 19th century a number of movements emerged which blended traditional Māori beliefs with Christianity. These included Pai Mārire, Ringatū, and in the early-20th century, Rātana. They typically centred on a prophet-leader. These churches continue to attract a substantial following; according to the 2013 census, 50,565 people are Rātana believers, and another 16,419 are Ringatū. 1,689 people stated that they followed Māori religion.

Pākehā have become steadily less religious over the course of the 20th century. In the 1920s there was still a reasonably high level of sectarianism and anti-Catholic prejudice, but this has since died down and the major churches generally co-operate with each other. The churches and religious lobby groups have little political influence where Pākehā are concerned. The vast majority of religious Pākehā are Christian, but a small number follow non-Christian religions, particularly Buddhism. The Scottish (Presbyterian) English (Anglican) division can still be seen in the religious distribution of some cities and suburbs. It has also been evidenced that New Zealand&#x27;s lack of religion correlates with income and income correlates with urban location; in Auckland, for example, the richest suburbs are the least religious. A wider range of immigrant groups in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions.

According to the 2013 census, the number of people who affiliated with a Christian denomination (including Māori Christian) decreased to 1,906,398 (48.9% of all people who stated their religious affiliation), down from 2,082,942 (55.6%) in 2006. Affiliation to non-Christian religions has increased since the 2006 census. , the number of Hindus numbered 88,919, Buddhists 58,404, Muslims 46,149, and Sikhs 19,191. The number and proportion of people indicating they had no religion increased between 2006 and 2013. In 2013, 1,635,345 New Zealanders (41.9%) reported they had no religion.

==Class in New Zealand==

Until about 1980s it was often claimed that New Zealand was a classless society. 

New Zealanders&#x27; egalitarianism has been criticised as discouraging and denigrating ambition and individual achievement and success. New Zealanders tend to value modesty and distrust those who talk about their own merits. They especially dislike anyone who seems to consider themselves better than others even if the person in question is demonstrably more talented or successful than others. This attitude can manifest itself in the tall poppy syndrome or crab mentality, which refer to &#x27;cutting down&#x27; of those thought to have risen above the general mass of people.

It has been argued that in New Zealand ethnicity plays the traditional role of class, with Māori and other Polynesians earning less, having a lower standard of living and less education, and working in lower status jobs than Pākehā.

New Zealand&#x27;s claims to be a classless society were dealt a fatal blow in the 1980s and 1990s by the economic reforms of the fourth Labour government and its successor, the fourth National government. A cultural shift also took place due to the economic and social impact of international capital, commerce and advertising. New Zealanders were exposed to a previously unknown array of consumer goods and franchises. Aided by overseas programming, commercial radio and TV stations enjoyed rapid growth. Local manufacturing suffered from cheap imports, with many jobs lost. These reforms led to a dramatic increase in income inequality between the richest and poorest New Zealanders, and an increase in the numbers living in poverty. Recent appreciation of real estate values increased the wealth of a generation of landowners while making housing unaffordable for many. Some are concerned that a New Zealand property bubble may burst, potentially wiping out considerable wealth.

==Travel==

It is very common for New Zealanders to travel or live overseas for extended periods of time, often on working holidays. These are usually referred to as the &#x27;OE&#x27; or &#x27;overseas experience&#x27;, and are most commonly taken by people in their 20s.

The OE to Europe is usually self-funded, and tends to occur a few years after university graduation, when the traveller has saved up enough for airfares and living expenses. The length of the visit can range from a few months to the remainder of the visitor&#x27;s life; since many New Zealanders have British ancestry or dual citizenship (sometimes as a result of their parents&#x27; OE), the restrictions on working in Britain do not apply to a substantial percentage of them.

Since the signing of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement in 1973, New Zealanders have had the right to live and work in Australia on equal terms with Australian citizens.

New Zealand has a number of reciprocal working holiday agreements, allowing people in their 20s to live and work overseas, usually for up to a year. Such agreements are in place with: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Uruguay.

==National stereotypes==

===The Kiwi male===

The stereotyped New Zealand male is essentially a pioneer type: he is perceived to be rural, strong, unemotional, democratic, has little time for high culture, good with animals (particularly horses) and machines, and is able to turn his hand to nearly anything. This type of man is often presumed to be a unique product of New Zealand&#x27;s colonial period but he shares many similarities with the stereotypical American frontiersman and Australian bushman. New Zealand men are supposed to still have many of these qualities, even though most New Zealanders have lived in urban areas since the late-19th century. This has not prevented New Zealanders seeing themselves (and being seen) as essentially country people and good at the tasks which country life requires.

:The hard man: New Zealand men have often been stereotyped as strong, unemotional and prone to violence. For many years this was seen as a good thing, and was best embodied by All Black Colin Meads. Voted &#x27;New Zealand player of the century&#x27; by &quot;New Zealand Rugby Monthly&quot; magazine, Meads was the second All Black to be sent off the field, and once played a match with a broken arm. Although he was known to assault other players during games, this was generally approved of as &#x27;enforcement&#x27; of the &#x27;spirit of the game&#x27;. He was also a supporter of sporting contact with apartheid South Africa. In recent decades the macho attitude has been both criticised and reviled as dangerous both to men who embody it and those around them. It has been blamed for New Zealand&#x27;s culture of heavy drinking and its high male suicide rate. However it still has its supporters, with some commentators claiming that the more recent All Blacks do not have enough &#x27;mongrel&#x27;.

==Attitudes==
===Social conservatism and progressiveness===
New Zealand social policy has tended to oscillate between social progressiveness and conservatism. Social reforms pioneered by New Zealand include women&#x27;s suffrage, the welfare state, and respect for indigenous peoples (through the Treaty of Waitangi and the Waitangi Tribunal). Having led the (non-communist) world in economic regulation from the 1930s, in the 1980s and 1990s the reforms of the Labour Government led the world in economic de-regulation. New Zealand was the first country to have an openly transgender mayor, and later member of parliament, Georgina Beyer. Same-sex marriage has been legal in New Zealand since 19 August 2013.

In contrast to this, New Zealand has a history of some very conservative social policies. Most notably, from World War One until 1967 pubs were required by law to close at 6pm.

In a rare occurrence, the 1981 Springbok Tour saw the two extremes very publicly clash with each other on a nationwide scale.

===Attitudes to authority===

In general, New Zealanders have faith in their democracy. New Zealand is perceived to have very low levels of corruption although some question whether those perceptions are entirely warranted. Turnout for parliamentary general elections is typically above 80%, which is very high by international standards and occurs despite the absence of any law requiring citizens to vote. However local government elections have much lower turnout figures, with an average of 53% in 2007.

New Zealanders, both those of Pākehā and Māori roots, have been described as an individualistic people, who take intrusion very personally, especially when it occurs onto private land (but also sometimes in a wider sense). According to psychologists, this is rooted respectively in the &#x27;frontier&#x27; image of the European settler culture, but also mirrored amongst the Māori, for whom land holds a lot of spiritual value in addition to its commercial use.

===Attitudes to multiculturalism===
New Zealand has for most of its modern history been an isolated bicultural society. In recent decades an increasing number of immigrants has changed the demographic spectra. In the larger cities this change has occurred suddenly and dramatically. There has been an increasing awareness of multiculturalism in New Zealand in all areas of society and also in politics. New Zealand&#x27;s race relations has been a controversial topic in recent times. The political party New Zealand First has been associated with an anti-immigration policy. The Office of the Race Relations Conciliator was established by the Race Relations Act in 1971 for the purposes of &quot;promoting positive race relations and addressing complaints of discrimination on grounds of race, colour, and ethnic or national origin&quot;, and was merged with the Human Rights Commission in January 2002.

==Food==

===Māori cuisine===

Māori cuisine was historically derived from that of tropical Polynesia, adapted for New Zealand&#x27;s colder climate. Key ingredients included kūmara (sweet potato), fern root, taro, birds and fish. Food was cooked in hāngī (earth ovens) and roasted, and in geothermal areas was boiled or steamed using natural hot springs and pools. Various means of preserving birds and other foods were also employed. Before the arrival of European settlers, Māori did not drink alcoholic beverages.

Following the arrival of British settlers, the Māori adopted many of their foods, especially pork and potatoes, the latter of which transformed the Māori agricultural economy. Many traditional food sources became scarce as introduced predators dramatically reduced bird populations, and forests were cleared for farming and timber. Traditional seafoods such as toheroa and whitebait were over-harvested. Present day Māori cuisine is a mixture of Māori tradition, 19th century British cookery, and contemporary dishes. In everyday life the two foods of Māori origin are &quot;the boil up&quot; (meat and vegetables boiled in a broth and sometimes thickened with flour), and the hāngī which is associated with special occasions.

===Pākehā cuisine===

Since the majority of Pākehā are of British descent, Pākehā cuisine is heavily influenced by British cuisine.

In recent decades international cuisine, including Chinese and Indian, has become popular, and as in many other countries &#x27;foodie&#x27; culture has emerged. New Zealand chefs such as Peter Gordon played a major part in the creation of fusion cuisine.

Café culture has grown to be a major element of New Zealand cuisine. Cafés and a high standard of espresso coffee making have become common throughout the country.

<text>Many surgical procedure names can be broken into parts to indicate the meaning. For example, in gastrectomy, &quot;ectomy&quot; is a suffix meaning the removal of a part of the body. &quot;Gastro-&quot; means stomach. Thus, &quot;gastrectomy&quot; refers to the surgical removal of the stomach (or sections thereof). &quot;Otomy&quot; means cutting into a part of the body; a &quot;gastrotomy&quot; would be cutting into, but not necessarily removing, the stomach. In addition, &quot;pharyngo&quot; means pharynx, &quot;laryngo&quot; means larynx, &quot;esophag&quot; means esophagus. Thus, &quot;pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy&quot; refers to the surgical removal of the three.

The field of minimally invasive surgery has spawned another set of words, such as &quot;arthroscopic&quot; or &quot;laparoscopic&quot; surgery. These take the same form as above; an arthroscope is a device which allows the inside of the joint to be seen.

<doc id="162856" wikidata="Q234392" url="?curid=162856" title="Ngaio Marsh">
<text>Dame Edith Ngaio Marsh ( ; 23 April 1895 – 18 February 1982) was a New Zealand writer. 

As a crime writer during the &quot;Golden Age of Detective Fiction&quot;, Marsh is known as one of the &quot;Queens of Crime&quot;, along with Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Margery Allingham. She is known primarily for her character Inspector Roderick Alleyn, a gentleman detective who works for the Metropolitan Police (London).

The Ngaio Marsh Awards are awarded annually for the best New Zealand mystery, crime and thriller fiction writing.

==Youth==

Marsh was born in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand, where she also died. In the Introduction to &quot;The Collected Short Fiction of Ngaio Marsh&quot;, Douglas G. Greene writes: &quot;Marsh explained to an interviewer... that in New Zealand European children often receive native names, and Ngaio... can mean either &#x27;light on the water&#x27; or &#x27;little tree bug&#x27; in the Māori language. Other sources say that it is the name of a native flowering tree.&quot; Her father neglected to register her birth until 1900 and there is some uncertainty about the date. She was the only child of Rose and bank clerk Henry Marsh, described by Marsh as &quot;have-nots&quot;. Her mother&#x27;s sister Ruth married the geologist, lecturer, and curator Robert Speight.

Ngaio Marsh was educated at St Margaret&#x27;s College in Christchurch, where she was one of the first pupils when the school was founded. She studied painting at the Canterbury College (NZ) School of Art before joining the Allan Wilkie company as an actress in 1916 and touring New Zealand. For a short time in 1921 she was a member of the Rosemary Rees English Comedy Company, a touring company formed by actor-manager Rosemary Rees.

In 1928 Marsh went to London with friends (on whom she would base the Lamprey family [&quot;Surfeit of Lampreys&quot;]). From then on she divided her time between living in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In London she began writing syndicated articles, which were published in New Zealand. In addition she and one of the friends with whom she had come to London opened Touch and Go, a handicraft shop that sold items such as decorated trays, bowls and lampshades. From 1928 to 1932 she ran the shop in Knightsbridge, London. During that time she wrote her first book, &quot;A Man Lay Dead&quot;. She wrote about the process of writing her first book in an essay, &quot;Roderick Alleyn&quot;.

Marsh was a member of The Group, an art association based in Christchurch, New Zealand. She exhibited with them in 1927, 1928, 1935, 1936, 1938, 1940 and 1947.

==Career==

Internationally she is best known for her 32 detective novels published between 1934 and 1982. Along with Dorothy L. Sayers, Margery Allingham and Agatha Christie, she has been classed as one of the four original &quot;Queens of Crime&quot; —female writers who dominated the genre of crime fiction in the Golden Age of the 1920s and 1930s. Agatha Chistie held that both Muriel Spark and Ngaio Marsh wrote &quot;a very good detective story&quot;.

All her novels feature British CID detective Roderick Alleyn. Several novels feature Marsh&#x27;s other loves, the theatre and painting. A number are set around theatrical productions (&quot;Enter a Murderer&quot;, &quot;Vintage Murder&quot;, &quot;Overture to Death&quot;, &quot;Opening Night&quot;, &quot;Death at the Dolphin&quot;, and &quot;Light Thickens&quot;), and three others are about actors off stage (&quot;Colour Scheme&quot;, &quot;False Scent&quot; and &quot;Final Curtain&quot;). Her short story &quot;&#x27;I Can Find My Way Out&quot; is also set around a theatrical production and is the earlier &quot;Jupiter case&quot; referred to in &quot;Opening Night&quot;; the short story won third prize in 1946 in the inaugural short story contest of &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. Alleyn marries a painter, Agatha Troy, whom he meets during an investigation (&quot;Artists in Crime&quot;), and who features in three later novels.

Most of the novels are set in England, but four are set in New Zealand, with Alleyn either on secondment to the New Zealand police (&quot;Colour Scheme&quot; and &quot;Died in the Wool&quot;) or on holiday (&quot;Vintage Murder&quot; and &quot;Photo Finish&quot;); &quot;Surfeit of Lampreys&quot; begins in New Zealand but continues in London.

Notably, &quot;Colour Scheme&quot; includes Māori people among its cast of characters, unusual for novels of the British mystery genre. This novel is said to further subvert the genre by incorporating elements of spy fiction and providing a veiled critique of the British Empire.

In 2018, HarperCollins Publishers released &quot;Money in the Morgue&quot; by Ngaio Marsh and Stella Duffy. The book was started by Marsh during World War II but abandoned. Working with just the book&#x27;s title, first three chapters and some notes –but no idea of the plot or motive of the villain– Duffy completed the novel.

==Theatre==
Marsh&#x27;s great passion was the theatre. In 1942 she produced a modern-dress &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the Canterbury University College Drama Society (now University of Canterbury Dramatic Society Incorporated or Dramasoc), the first of many Shakespearean productions with the society until 1969. In 1944, &quot;Hamlet&quot; and a production of &quot;Othello&quot; toured a theatre-starved New Zealand to rapturous acclaim. In 1949, assisted by entrepreneur Dan O&#x27;Connor, her student players toured Australia with a new version of &quot;Othello&quot; and Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;. In the 1950s she was involved with the New Zealand Players, a relatively short-lived national professional touring repertory company. In 1972 she was invited by the Christchurch City Council to direct Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, the inaugural production for the opening of the newly constructed James Hay Theatre in Christchurch; she made the unusual choice of casting two male leads, who alternated on different nights.

She lived to see New Zealand develop a viable professional theatre industry having realistic Arts Council support, with many of her protégés to the forefront. The 430-seat Ngaio Marsh Theatre at the University of Canterbury is named in her honour.

==Museum==

Her home, now known as Ngaio Marsh House, in Cashmere, a suburb of Christchurch on the northern slopes of the Port Hills, is preserved as a museum.

==Awards and honours==
* 1948 – Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services in connexion with drama and literature in New Zealand, in the 1948 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours
* 1962 – Conferred an honorary doctorate by the University of Canterbury
* 1966 – Appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services in the arts, especially writing and theatre production, in the 1966 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours
* 1974 – Inducted into the Detection Club
* 1978 – Received the Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement as a detective novelist from the Mystery Writers of America
* 1989 – Honoured with a stamp by New Zealand Post as part of a New Zealand authors series
* 2015 – Honoured on 23 April 2015 with a Google Doodle

==Personal life==
Marsh was unofficially engaged to Edward Bristed, who died in action in December 1917. She never married and had no children. She enjoyed close companionships with women, including her lifelong friend Sylvia Fox, but denied being lesbian, according to biographer Joanne Drayton.
&quot;I think Ngaio Marsh wanted the freedom of being who she was in a world, especially in a New Zealand that was still very conformist in its judgments of what constituted &#x27;decent jokers, good Sheilas, and &#x27;weirdos&#x27;&quot;, Roy Vaughan wrote after meeting her on a P&amp;O Liner. A detective novel,&quot;Blue Blood&quot; (1997), by Stevan Eldred-Grigg in a pastiche of her style, portrays her in a lesbian relationship.

In 1965, she published an autobiography, &quot;Black Beech and Honeydew&quot;. British author and publisher Margaret Lewis wrote an authorized biography, &quot;Ngaio Marsh, A Life&quot; in 1991. New Zealand art historian Joanne Drayton&#x27;s biography, &quot;Ngaio Marsh: Her Life in Crime&quot; was published in 2008. Towards the end of her life she systematically destroyed many of her papers, letters, documents and handwritten manuscripts.

Marsh died in Christchurch and was buried at the Church of the Holy Innocents, Mount Peel.

==Adaptations==
Two novels were adapted as television episodes in the 1960s; &quot;Death in Ecstasy&quot; in 1964 with Geoffrey Keen as Alleyn, and &quot;Artists in Crime&quot; in 1968 with Michael Allinson as Alleyn.

Four of the Alleyn novels were adapted for television in New Zealand and aired there in 1977 under the title &quot;Ngaio Marsh Theatre&quot;, with George Baker as Alleyn. Marsh appears in a cameo in the episode &quot;Vintage Murder&quot;.

Nine were adapted as &quot;The Inspector Alleyn Mysteries&quot; and aired by the BBC in 1993 and 1994 (the pilot originally in 1990), with Simon Williams (pilot) and then Patrick Malahide as Alleyn.

In the 1990s the BBC made radio adaptations of &quot;Surfeit of Lampreys&quot;, &quot;A Man Lay Dead&quot;, &quot;Opening Night&quot;, and &quot;When in Rome&quot; starring Jeremy Clyde as Inspector Alleyn, and in 2010 &quot;Death and the Dancing Footman&quot; featuring Nigel Graham.

Ngaio Marsh co-wrote the 1951 episode &quot;Night at the Vulcan&quot; of the Philco Television Playhouse; and appeared as herself in the sixth episode &quot;The Central Problem&quot; in a television series of the unfinished Charles Dickens mystery novel &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;.

<text>Kevin Christopher McFadden (born November 12, 1955), known by his pseudonym Christopher Pike, is an American author of children&#x27;s fiction and for mystery-thrillers and supernatural horror fiction, mainly for young adults though he has also published adult fiction.

==Biography==
McFadden was born in New York City in 1955, but grew up in California. He attended college briefly before quitting and working various jobs such as house painting and computer programming. He initially tried writing science fiction and adult mystery, but later began writing teen thrillers due to an editor&#x27;s suggestion. 

His first novel, &quot;Slumber Party&quot;, was written initially as a supernatural thriller containing a character with pyrokinesis (psychic ability to start and control fire), which he later eliminated upon the request of his editor. The book was then re-written as a mystery thriller about a group of teenagers who encounter bizarre and violent events during a skiing weekend. His editor sold the book to Scholastic Press, which released it in 1985. Pike&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Weekend&quot;, was also published through Scholastic. He would later publish one more novel through Scholastic, the 1986 &quot;Chain Letter&quot;, after which he engaged mainly with Simon and Schuster. 

Pike continued to write several young adult novels, and also juvenile novels comprising the series &quot;Spooksville&quot;, as well as several adult novels such as his 1990 book, &quot;Sati&quot;. Spooksville was adapted into a television series in 2013 for the Hub network (now known as Discovery Family).

== Adaptations ==
On November 25, 1996, Pike&#x27;s novel &quot;Fall Into Darkness&quot; was adapted into a television movie of the same name, produced by his company Christopher Pike Productions. His novels &quot;The Midnight Club&quot; and &quot;The Season of Passage&quot; have both been optioned, for a television series and movie, by movie-maker Mike Flanagan for Netflix. &quot;The Midnight Club&quot; was released on Netflix on October 7, 2022. Two days after the series&#x27; release, on October 9, Flanagan confirmed that Netflix had in fact optioned &quot;28 books&quot; of Pike&#x27;s, and that he had advocated &quot;The Midnight Club&quot; television series as &quot;&quot;The Midnight Club&quot; — but the stories the kids tell [each other] will be other Christopher Pike books&quot;, with a plan for the series to last multiple seasons. However in December 2022 it was announced the series had been cancelled after only one season.

<doc id="162862" wikidata="Q907540" url="?curid=162862" title="Puddle of Mudd">
<text>Puddle of Mudd is an American rock band formed in Kansas City, Missouri in 1992. The band has sold over seven million albums. Their major-label debut, &quot;Come Clean&quot; (2001), spawned the single &quot;Blurry&quot;, which peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and remains their signature song. The album sold over five million copies by 2003, and was followed by five additional albums, the latest of which is &quot;Ubiquitous&quot; (2023). Vocalist and guitarist Wes Scantlin has served as the only consistent member throughout the band&#x27;s history.

==History==
===Early years (1992–1999)===
Puddle of Mudd was formed in 1992 in Kansas City by Wes Scantlin (lead vocals/rhythm guitar), Jimmy Allen (lead guitar), Sean Sammon (bass), and Kenny Burkitt (drums). According to Scantlin, the band name was inspired by practicing next to the Missouri river levee, which often inundated the band&#x27;s practice space, but never ruined their equipment since they were on the second floor. In order to get to their practice space, the band &quot;had to walk through a pile of shit.&quot;

In August 1994, the band played at the Missouri State Fair. The group&#x27;s first release, &quot;Stuck&quot;, a seven-song EP, was released in 1994 on V&amp;R Records. It was produced by the band and E.J. Rose, and was recorded at Red House Studio in Lawrence, Kansas. It spawned two radio singles: &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know&quot; and &quot;Drift and Die&quot;.

Minus Jimmy Allen, the group released an eleven-song indie album, &quot;Abrasive&quot;, in 1997 on the Madison-based label Hardknocks Records. Three of the songs from &quot;Abrasive&quot; were later re-recorded for the band&#x27;s major-label debut &quot;Come Clean&quot;. Differences of opinion and other factors led to the break-up of the original Puddle of Mudd by early 1999, leaving Scantlin as the only original member.

===&quot;Come Clean&quot; (2000–2002)===
Scantlin&#x27;s big break in the music business came after a copy of his demo tape was delivered to Fred Durst. Durst contacted Scantlin, and after hearing that his band had broken up, decided to bring him to California to attempt to put a new band together. At a 2001 Flawless Records showcase, Durst noted that he originally disliked the band&#x27;s material and told Scantlin to fire everyone else in the band and rebuild it from scratch.

One of the first people Scantlin met upon arriving in California was Doug Ardito, an intern at Interscope Records. When Scantlin found out about Ardito&#x27;s bass playing, they decided to work together. They were still in need of a guitarist and drummer. Fred Durst decided to contact a guitarist he knew from his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida, Paul Phillips, who had formerly played in a local band there called Happy Hour. After getting the call from Durst, Paul decided to try out for Puddle of Mudd and was accepted, choosing to leave college in order to join. The band held auditions for a new drummer and selected Greg Upchurch, who was an ex-member of Eleven and had also toured with Chris Cornell.

Puddle of Mudd entered the studio in 2000 and released its major-label debut album &quot;Come Clean&quot; on August 28, 2001. The lead single from the album, &quot;Control&quot; was successful. It was also the theme song for WWE&#x27;s &quot;Survivor Series 2001,&quot; which was critically acclaimed. The second single off the album, &quot;Blurry&quot;, co-written with Jimmy Allen and Doug Ardito, turned out to be Puddle of Mudd&#x27;s most successful single, reaching No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart, and also winning an ASCAP song of the year award for Ardito, Allen and Scantlin. The song was also used in the game &quot;Ace Combat 5&quot;, published by Namco. &quot;Drift &amp; Die&quot; co-written by Jimmy Allen was also released as a single spending six weeks at the No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The fourth single, &quot;She Hates Me&quot; co-written by Jimmy Allen was released in late 2002, and reached the No. 1 spot on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, as well as No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Allen and Scantlin won the ASCAP award for most played rock song of the year.

The group then embarked on a European and American tour as the opening act for Godsmack and Deftones, and were also a part of the Family Values 2001 tour, alongside Linkin Park, Stone Temple Pilots, and Staind.

The album was certified triple platinum in the U.S. by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 31, 2003, and as of late 2006, total sales worldwide were in excess of five million copies.

===&quot;Life on Display&quot; (2003–2005)===
Puddle of Mudd&#x27;s follow up, &quot;Life on Display&quot;, spawned three singles &quot;Away from Me&quot;, &quot;Heel Over Head&quot;, and &quot;Spin You Around&quot;. The album sold below expectations. Although shortly after its release, the record was certified gold and to date, has sold over 706,000 copies. Some suggested this was the primary cause of drummer Greg Upchurch&#x27;s leaving the band to join 3 Doors Down. Marisa Miller appeared in the music video for &quot;Spin You Around&quot;. &quot;Away From Me&quot; was featured in &quot;The O.C.&quot; in 2004. The song &quot;Nothing Left to Lose&quot; was the official theme song of WWE&#x27;s 2004 Royal Rumble.

===&quot;Famous&quot; (2006–2008)===

On October 9, 2007, the band released their third major label record, &quot;Famous&quot;. The first single, &quot;Famous&quot;, was released through the band&#x27;s Myspace page and radio in July before the CD was released. It was a #1 single. Another track, &quot;Merry Go Round&quot;, was released through iTunes before the official release. The following single, &quot;Psycho&quot;, topped both the Mainstream Rock Tracks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts for nine weeks. &quot;Livin&#x27; on Borrowed Time&quot; and &quot;We Don&#x27;t Have To Look Back Now&quot; were the final singles released.

In the spring of 2007, the band went on tour supporting Hinder and Papa Roach on the Door to Dorm tour.

Their song &quot;Famous&quot; was the WWE One Night Stand 2007 official theme song and was also featured in the video game &quot;WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2008&quot;, as well as &quot;UFC 2009 Undisputed&quot;.

===&quot;Vol.4 Songs in the Key of Love and Hate&quot; (2009–2010)===
In 2009, former guitarist Paul Phillips rejoined the band after replacement Christian Stone was let go on good terms. Around this time the band recruited &quot;Famous&quot; producer Brian Howes to begin recording a new record in Vancouver. Prior to the new album&#x27;s release, band members said the album&#x27;s name would be called &#x27;Jacket on the Rack&#x27;. However, it was changed to &quot;Volume 4: Songs in the Key of Love &amp; Hate.&quot; Released on December 8, it has gone on to sell around 100,000 copies. The first single, &quot;Spaceship&quot;, was released in October 2009.

On February 10, 2010, a new song, &quot;Shook Up the World&quot;, was released. It was written for Team USA for use in the 2010 Winter Olympics. All proceeds from the song went to Team USA. Although intended for release during the Olympics, the deadline was missed. At the beginning of that same year bassist Doug Ardito left the band and was replaced by Jacksonville Burn Season frontman, Damien Starkey. They played at the Download Festival, and released their first best of collection, titled &quot;Icon&quot;, featuring the singles from their first four albums.

===&quot;Re:(disc)overed&quot; (2011–2019)===
The band released a cover album titled &quot;&quot; on August 30, 2011. The release featured covers of songs originally by The Rolling Stones, Bad Company, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and others. According to original bassist Sean Sammon, it was confirmed that the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Stuck&quot; and &quot;Abrasive&quot;, would be re-released sometime in late 2011. Ardito rejoined the band in 2011 and proceeded to tour with them. Ryan Yerdon was also replaced by Shannon Boone. The band posted several online updates during 2012 suggesting that they were writing and recording a new album. Wes Scantlin was interviewed about his latest arrest for vandalism in July 2013, where he was quoted as saying &quot;We have tons and tons of new hit songs. I write every single night, and we record all the time. We&#x27;re getting ready to go in and do the record, tour a little bit for the summer, and then do the full production and get back on the scene.&quot;

Puddle of Mudd toured during 2014 featuring Wes Scantlin with an entirely different line-up. A non-album single, &quot;Piece of the Action&quot;, was released in September 2014.

The band started recording a new album with Cameron Webb at Grandmaster Studios in 2015. The following year they took part in the Make America Rock Again super tour with other artists who had success throughout the 2000s including Trapt, Saving Abel, Alien Ant Farm, Crazy Town, 12 Stones, Tantric, Drowning Pool, P.O.D. and Fuel.

===&quot;Welcome to Galvania&quot; (2019–2023)===
In July 2019, a new single, &quot;Uh Oh&quot;, was released, with the full album &quot;Welcome to Galvania&quot; following in September.

In November 2019, the band performed an acoustic session for SiriusXM&#x27;s Octane channel. The session went largely unnoticed until April 2020, when the Instagram music meme account @catatonicyouths posted edited clips of the band&#x27;s cover of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;About a Girl&quot;. The cover was also given a reaction video by YouTubers Jared Dines and Steve Terreberry. The cover has been widely criticised and ridiculed, with most of the focus being placed upon Scantlin&#x27;s strained, uncomfortable, and off-key vocals. The original video, which has now received over one million views and has since gone unlisted, currently sits at 24,000 dislikes against 9,800 likes.

=== &quot;Ubiquitous&quot; (2023–present) ===
In 2022, Scantlin stated a new album was in the works, and was &#x27;basically pretty much done&#x27;. The band&#x27;s sixth album titled &#x27;Ubiquitous&#x27; was released on September 8, 2023.

With the release of &quot;Ubiquitous&quot; marked Puddle of Mudd&#x27;s first album not to include newly recorded material, the tracklist is composed of demos throughout Puddle of Mudd&#x27;s career, including their 1994 track &quot;Poke Out My Eyes&quot;, as well as &quot;Dance With Me&quot; and &quot;U Wrekd Me,&quot; both songs originally recorded during the sessions for their 2007 release Famous, other tracks such as &quot;My Baby&quot;, &quot;Running Out of Time&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot;, &quot;Complication&quot; and &quot;California&quot; were recorded with former members Doug Ardito and Christian Stone in 2012 in anticipation of a scrapped 6th album.

Later tracks include &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; and &quot;Butterface&quot;, both tracks being written and recorded in 2022, whereas &quot;Cash and Cobain&quot; was recorded in 2020.

Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Wes Scantlin cancelled upcoming shows due to the shows being booked without his consent by his management team. Scantlin stated in a later interview that all involved in the bookings were fired and may have included band members.

==Musical style==
Puddle of Mudd is generally described as post-grunge. Some sources have described them as nu metal, hard rock, and alternative metal.

==Controversies==
Since 2012, Scantlin has been accused on numerous occasions of lip syncing during live performances.

On April 16, 2014, Scantlin had an on-stage meltdown during a show at Trees Dallas, in which he threw a microphone and beer into the audience, as well as appearing to threaten and attempt to physically attack members of the audience. He also received criticism as he appeared to be lip-syncing during the performance.

On June 20, 2015, the band was booed off stage at a show in Versailles, Ohio, after Scantlin was spotted lip-syncing to the songs. In response to the social media backlash, the band subsequently deleted their Facebook page. With the Facebook page available, the Austin, Texas-based rock band Black Heart Saints gained access as an opportunity to promote their music using the page title &quot;Check This Band Out Instead&quot;, although later Puddle of Mudd decided to use the page again.

On August 18, 2017, Thetford Mines&#x27; Festival de la Relève had to cancel a performance by the band, who were the festival&#x27;s headliners, after neither Scantlin nor the rest of the band appeared at Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport, where volunteers were to pick them up to drive them to the festival. No reason was given for the band&#x27;s absence.

==Connection with Fred Durst==
Due to the notoriety surrounding how the band was signed with Durst, the band is often asked regarding their relationship with him. Scantlin criticized Durst in an interview in 2004 with Canada&#x27;s &quot;Chart&quot; magazine: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t write our songs, he doesn&#x27;t produce our songs, he doesn&#x27;t do anything for us. He doesn&#x27;t do our videos anymore. He doesn&#x27;t do anything for this band. I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing, I don&#x27;t know what the guy&#x27;s like. All I know is that he&#x27;s like Mr Hollywood guy, Mr Celebrity. Like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities&#x27;. Every single fucking interview I&#x27;ve ever fucking done, I get asked about that fucking guy... And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual... People think he writes music with me or something. He does not do that. I just don&#x27;t get it. We have nothing in common. He doesn&#x27;t even call us, he has his assistant call us to congratulate us on our record. Yeah, that&#x27;s how pathetic he is.&quot;

On April 22, 2008, in an interview with Artisan News Service, Wes Scantlin took back his previous criticism of Fred Durst: &quot;[Fred] got our foot in the door and helped us out tremendously. I think nowadays he&#x27;s doing a lot of directing and we don&#x27;t really speak to him too much but we appreciate everything he&#x27;s ever done for our careers.&quot;

Limp Bizkit and Puddle of Mudd played together on Epicenter 2011, along with another one of Durst&#x27;s former proteges, Staind.

Scantlin later stated that he wanted to make a movie regarding his life and music career, and that he wanted to involve Durst, who had directed several films himself.

<doc id="162863" wikidata="Q155490" url="?curid=162863" title="Lockheed P-3 Orion">
<text>The Lockheed P-3 Orion is a four-engined, turboprop anti-submarine and maritime surveillance aircraft developed for the United States Navy and introduced in the 1960s. It is based it on the L-188 Electra commercial airliner by Lockheed; it is easily distinguished from the Electra by its distinctive tail stinger or &quot;MAD&quot; boom, used for the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) of submarines.

Over the years, the P-3 has seen numerous design developments, most notably in its electronics packages. Numerous navies and air forces around the world continue to use the type primarily for maritime patrol, reconnaissance, anti-surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare. A total of 757 P-3s have been built. In 2012, it joined the handful of military aircraft including the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, and Lockheed C-130 Hercules that the United States military has been using for more than 50 years. In the twenty-first century, the turbofan-powered Boeing P-8 Poseidon began to supplement, and will eventually replace, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s P-3s.

==Development==

===Origins===
In August 1957, the U.S. Navy called for proposals for replacement of the piston-engined Lockheed P2V Neptune (later redesignated P-2) and Martin P5M Marlin (later redesignated P-5) with a more advanced aircraft to conduct maritime patrol and antisubmarine warfare. Modifying an existing aircraft should save on cost and to allow rapid introduction into the fleet. Lockheed suggested a military version of its L-188 Electra, then still in development and yet to fly. In April 1958, Lockheed won the competition and was awarded an initial research-and-development contract in May.

Lockheed modified the prototype YP3V-1/YP-3A, Bureau Number (BuNo) 148276 from the third Electra airframe c/n 1003. The first flight of the aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamic prototype, originally designated YP3V-1, took place on 19 August 1958. While based on the same design philosophy as the Electra, the aircraft differed structurally; it had less fuselage forward of the wings with an opening bomb bay, and a more pointed nose radome, a distinctive tail &quot;stinger&quot; for detection of submarines by MAD, wing hardpoints, and other internal, external, and airframe-production technique enhancements.

The Orion has four Allison T56 turboprops, which give it a top speed of comparable to the fastest propeller fighters, or even to slow high-bypass turbofan jets such as the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II or the Lockheed S-3 Viking. Similar patrol aircraft include the Soviet Ilyushin Il-38, the French Breguet Atlantique and the British jet-powered Hawker Siddeley Nimrod (based on the de Havilland Comet).

The first production version, designated P3V-1, was launched on 15 April 1961. Initial squadron deliveries to Patrol Squadron Eight (VP-8) and Patrol Squadron Forty-Four (VP-44) at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, began in August 1962. On 18 September 1962, the U.S. military transitioned to a unified designation system for all services, with the aircraft being renamed the P-3 Orion. Paint schemes have changed from early 1960s, gloss seaplane gray and white to mid-1960s/1970s/1980s/early 1990s gloss white and gray, to mid-1990s flat-finish low-visibility gray with fewer and smaller markings. In the early 2000s, the paint scheme changed to its current overall gloss gray finish with the original full-sized color markings. However, large-sized BuNos on the vertical stabilizer and squadron designations on the fuselage remained largely omitted.

===Further developments===
In 1963, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Naval Weapons contracted Univac Defense Systems Division of Sperry Rand to engineer, build, and test a digital computer (a device then in its infancy) to interface with the many sensors and newly developing display units of the P-3 Orion. Project A-NEW was the engineering system, which after several early trials, produced the engineering prototype, the CP-823/U, Univac 1830, Serial A-1, A-NEW MOD3 Computing System. Univac delivered the CP-823/U to the Naval Air Development Center at Johnsville, Pennsylvania, in 1965; this directly led to the production computers later equipped on the P-3C.

Three civilian Electras were lost in fatal accidents between February 1959 and March 1960. Following the third crash, the FAA restricted the maximum speed of Electras pending determination of the causes. After an extensive investigation, two of the crashes (those of September 1959 and March 1960) were identified as due to insufficiently strong engine mounts, unable to damp a whirling motion that could affect the outboard engines. When the oscillation was transmitted to the wings, a severe vertical vibration escalated, tearing off the wings. The company implemented a costly modification program, labelled the Lockheed Electra Achievement Program, which strengthened the engine mounts and the wing structures supporting the mounts, and replaced some wing skins with thicker material. At its own expense, Lockheed modified all surviving Electras of the 145 built at that time, the process taking 20 days for each aircraft. These changes were incorporated into subsequent aircraft as they were built.

The Electra&#x27;s sales were limited as Lockheed&#x27;s technical fix did not completely erase the aircraft&#x27;s poor reputation in an era in which turboprop-powered aircraft were being replaced by faster jets. In military roles that valued fuel efficiency more than speed, the Orion remained in service for over 50 years after its 1962 introduction. Although surpassed in production longevity by the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, 734 P-3s were produced through 1990. Lockheed Martin opened a new P-3 wing production-line in 2008 as part of its Service Life Extension Program (ASLEP) for delivery in 2010. A complete ASLEP replaces the outer wings, center-wing lower section, and horizontal stabilizers with newly built parts.

In the 1990s, the U.S. Navy attempted to procure a successor aircraft to the P-3, and selected the improved P-7 over a naval-specific variant of the twin turbofan-powered Boeing 757, but this program was subsequently cancelled. In a second program to select a replacement, the advanced Lockheed Martin Orion 21, another P-3-derived aircraft, lost out to the Boeing P-8 Poseidon, a Boeing 737 variant, which entered service in 2013.

==Design==
The P-3 has an internal bomb bay under the front fuselage, which can house conventional Mark 50 torpedoes or Mark 46 torpedoes and/or special (nuclear) weapons. Additional underwing stations, or pylons, can carry other armament configurations, including the AGM-84 Harpoon, AGM-84E SLAM, AGM-84H/K SLAM-ER, AGM-65 Maverick, Zuni rockets, and various other sea mines, missiles, and gravity bombs. The aircraft also had the capability to carry the AGM-12 Bullpup guided missile until that weapon was withdrawn from U.S./NATO/Allied service.

The P-3 is equipped with a MAD in the extended tail. This instrument is able to detect the magnetic anomaly of a submarine in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The limited range of this instrument requires the aircraft to be near the submarine at low altitude. Because of this, it is primarily used for pinpointing the location of a submarine immediately prior to a torpedo or depth bomb attack. Due to the sensitivity of the detector, electromagnetic noise can interfere with it, so the detector is placed in P-3&#x27;s fiberglass tail stinger (MAD boom), far from other electronics and ferrous metals on the aircraft.

===Crew complement===

The crew complement varies depending on the role being flown, the variant being operated, and the country that is operating the type. In U.S. Navy service, the normal crew complement was 12 until it was reduced to its current complement of 11 in the early 2000s when the in-flight ordnanceman position was eliminated as a cost-savings measure and the ORD duties assumed by the in-flight technician. Data for U.S. Navy P-3C only.

Officers:
*three Naval Aviators
**Patrol Plane Commander (PPC)
**Patrol Plane 2nd Pilot (PP2P)
**Patrol Plane 3rd Pilot (PP3P)
*two Naval Flight Officers
**Patrol Plane Tactical Coordinator (PPTC or TACCO)
**Patrol Plane Navigator/Communicator (PPNC or NAVCOM)
NOTE: NAVCOM on P-3C only; USN P-3A and P-3B series had an NFO Navigator (TACNAV) and an enlisted Airborne Radio Operator (RO)

Enlisted aircrew:
*two enlisted Aircrew Flight Engineers (FE1 and FE2)

*one enlisted Aviation Ordnanceman (ORD position no longer used on USN crews; duties assumed by IFT)

The senior of either the PPC or TACCO will be designated as the aircraft Mission Commander (MC).

===Engine loiter shutdown===
Once on station, one engine is often shut down (usually the No. 1 engine – the left outer engine) to conserve fuel and extend the time aloft and/or range when at low level. It is the primary candidate for loiter shutdown because it has no generator. Eliminating the exhaust from engine 1 also improves visibility from the aft observer station on the left side of the aircraft.

On occasion, both outboard engines can be shut down, weight, weather, and fuel permitting. Long, deep-water, coastal, or border-patrol missions can last over 10 hours and may include extra crew. The record time aloft for a P-3 is 21.5 hours, undertaken by the Royal New Zealand Air Force&#x27;s No. 5 Squadron in 1972.

==Operational history==

===United States===

Developed during the Cold War, the P-3&#x27;s primary mission was to localize Soviet Navy ballistic missile and fast attack submarines detected by undersea surveillance systems and eliminate them in the event of full-scale war. At its height, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s P-3 community consisted of twenty-four active duty &quot;Fleet&quot; patrol squadrons home based at air stations in the states of Florida and Hawaii as well as bases which formerly had P-3 operations in Maryland, Maine, and California.

There were also thirteen Naval Reserve patrol squadrons identical to their active duty &quot;Fleet&quot; counterparts, said Reserve &quot;Fleet&quot; squadrons being based in Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, Massachusetts (later relocated to Maine), Illinois, Tennessee, Louisiana, California and Washington. Two Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS), also called &quot;RAG&quot; squadrons (from the historic &quot;Replacement Air Group&quot; nomenclature) were located in California and Florida. The since-deactivated VP-31 in California provided P-3 training for the Pacific Fleet, while VP-30 in Florida performed the task for the Atlantic Fleet. These squadrons were also augmented by a test and evaluation squadron in Maryland, two additional test and evaluation units that were part of an air development center in Pennsylvania and a test center in California, an oceanographic development squadron in Maryland, and two active duty &quot;special projects&quot; units in Maine and Hawaii, the latter being slightly smaller than a typical squadron.

In fiscal year 1995, the U.S. Navy planned to reduce active-duty patrol squadrons from sixteen to thirteen—seven on the East Coast, six on the West. The patrol squadrons planned to survive were VP-8, 10, 11, and 26 at NAS Brunswick, Maine, and VP-5, 16, and 45 at NAS Jacksonville, Florida. The Pacific squadrons that were to be retained were VP-1, 4, 9, and 47 at Barbers&#x27; Point, Hawaii, and 40 and VP-46 at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington. Thus Patrol Squadrons 17, 23, 24, and 49 were to be disestablished, and the remaining units were to operate nine aircraft instead of eight, augmented by VP-30 and the nine-at-the-time USNR P-3 squadrons.

Reconnaissance missions in international waters led to occasions where Soviet fighters would &quot;bump&quot; a P-3, either operated by the U.S. Navy or other operators such as the Royal Norwegian Air Force. On 1 April 2001, a midair collision between a United States Navy EP-3E ARIES II signals surveillance aircraft and a People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy J-8II jet fighter-interceptor resulted in an international dispute between the U.S. and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC).

More than 40 P-3 variants have demonstrated the type&#x27;s rugged reliability, commonly flying 12-hour plus missions over water. Versions were developed for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for research and hurricane hunting/hurricane wall busting, for the U.S. Customs Service (now U.S. Customs and Border Protection) for drug interdiction and aerial surveillance mission with a rotodome adapted from the Grumman E-2 Hawkeye or an AN/APG-66 radar adapted from the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, and for NASA for research and development.

The U.S. Navy remains the largest P-3 operator, currently distributed between a single fleet replacement (i.e., &quot;training&quot;) patrol squadron in Florida (VP-30), 12 active duty patrol squadrons distributed between bases in Florida, Washington and Hawaii, two Navy Reserve patrol squadrons in Florida and Washington, one active duty special projects patrol squadron (VPU-2) in Hawaii, and two active duty test and evaluation squadrons. One additional active duty fleet reconnaissance squadron (VQ-1) operates the EP-3 Aries signals intelligence (SIGINT) variant at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington.

In January 2011, the U.S. Navy revealed that P-3s have been used to hunt down &quot;third generation&quot; narco-submarines. This is significant because as recently as July 2009, fully submersible submarines have been used in smuggling operations. As of November 2013, the US Navy began phasing out the P-3 in favor of the newer and more advanced Boeing P-8 Poseidon.

In May 2020, Patrol Squadron 40 completed the transition to the P-8, marking the retirement of the P-3C from U.S. Navy active duty service. The last of the active-duty P-3Cs, aircraft 162776, was also delivered to the Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. Two Navy Reserve squadrons, Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 30 and One Active duty Squadron (VQ-1) continued to fly the P-3C. By July 2023, only VQ-1 and VXS-1 continued to operate variants of the P-3C, with the retirement of VQ-1&#x27;s EP-3E Aries II fleet expected in 2025.

===In Cuba===
In October 1962, P-3As flew several blockade patrols in the vicinity of Cuba. Having only joined the operational Fleet earlier that year, this event marked the first employment of the P-3 in a real world &quot;heightened threat&quot; situation.

===In Vietnam===
Beginning in 1964, forward deployed P-3s began flying various missions under Operation Market Time from bases in the Philippines and Vietnam. The primary focus of these coastal patrols was to stem the supply of materials to the Viet Cong by sea, although several of these missions also became overland &quot;feet dry&quot; sorties. During one such mission, a small caliber artillery shell passed through a P-3 without rendering it mission incapable. The only confirmed combat loss of a P-3 also occurred during Operation Market Time.

In April 1968, a U.S. Navy P-3B of VP-26 was downed by anti-aircraft fire in the Gulf of Thailand with the loss of the entire crew. Two months earlier in February 1968, another one of VP-26&#x27;s P-3Bs was operating in the same vicinity when it crashed with the loss of the entire crew. Originally attributed to a low altitude mishap, later conjecture is that this aircraft may have also fallen victim to anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) fire from the same source as the April incident.

===In Iraq===
On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and was poised to strike Saudi Arabia. Within 48 hours of the initial invasion, U.S. Navy P-3Cs were among the first American forces to arrive in the area. One was a modified platform with a prototype over-the-horizon targeting (OTH-T) system package known as &quot;Outlaw Hunter&quot;; it had been undergoing trials in the Pacific after being developed by Tiburon Systems, Inc. for NAVAIR&#x27;s PMA-290 Program Office. Within hours of the coalition air campaign&#x27;s start, &quot;Outlaw Hunter&quot; detected a large number of Iraqi patrol boats and naval vessels attempting to move from Basra and Umm Qasr to Iranian waters. &quot;Outlaw Hunter&quot; vectored in strike elements which attacked the flotilla near Bubiyan Island, destroying 11 vessels and damaging scores more. During Desert Shield, a P-3 using infrared imaging detected a ship with Iraqi markings beneath freshly-painted bogus Egyptian markings trying to avoid detection.

Several days before the 7 January 1991 commencement of Operation Desert Storm, a P-3C equipped with an APS-137 Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) conducted coastal surveillance along Iraq and Kuwait to provide pre-strike reconnaissance on enemy military installations. A total of 55 of the 108 Iraqi vessels destroyed during the conflict were targeted by P-3Cs.

The P-3&#x27;s mission expanded in the late 1990s and early 2000s to include battlespace surveillance both at sea and over land. The long range and long loiter time of the P-3 proved to be an invaluable asset during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, being able to instantaneously provide the gathered battlespace information to ground troops, particularly the U.S. Marines.

===In Afghanistan===
Although the P-3 is a MPA, armament and sensor upgrades in the Anti-surface Warfare Improvement Program (AIP) have made it suitable for sustained combat air support over land. In what became known as the &quot;Decade in the Desert&quot;, Navy P-3Cs patrolled combat zones in the Middle East and Southwest Asia. From the start of the war in Afghanistan, U.S. Navy P-3s operated from Kandahar in that role. Royal Australian Air Force AP-3Cs operated out of Minhad Air Base in the UAE from 2003 until their withdrawal in November 2012. Between 2008 and 2012, AP-3Cs conducted overland intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tasks in support of coalition troops across Afghanistan.

The United States Geological Survey used the Orion to survey parts of southern and eastern Afghanistan for lithium, copper, and other mineral deposits.

===In Libya===
Several U.S. Navy P-3Cs, and two Canadian CP-140 Auroras, a variant of the Orion, participated in maritime surveillance missions over Libyan waters in the framework of enforcement of the 2011 no-fly zone over Libya.

A U.S. Navy P-3C supporting Operation Odyssey Dawn engaged the Libyan coast guard vessel &quot;Vittoria&quot; on 28 March 2011 after the vessel and eight smaller craft fired on merchant ships in the port of Misrata, Libya. The Orion fired AGM-65 Maverick missiles on &quot;Vittoria&quot;, which was subsequently beached.

===Iran===

Lockheed produced the P-3F variant of the P-3 Orion for Pahlavi Iran. Six examples were delivered to the former Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) in 1975 and 1976.

Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Orions continued in service, after the IIAF was renamed the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF). They were used in the Tanker War phase of the Iran–Iraq War. A total of four P-3Fs remain in service.

===Pakistan===
Three P-3C Orions, delivered to the Pakistan Navy in 1996 and 1997 were operated extensively during the Kargil conflict. After the crash of one with the loss of an entire crew, the type was grounded; nonetheless, the aircraft were maintained in an armed state and airworthy condition throughout the escalation period of 2001 and 2002. During 2007, they were used by the navy to conduct signals intelligence, airborne and bombing operations in a Swat offensive and Operation Rah-e-Nijat. Precision and strategic bombing missions were carried out by the P-3Cs; intelligence management operations were also conducted against Taliban and al-Qaeda operatives.

On 22 May 2011, two out of the four Pakistani P-3Cs were destroyed in an attack on PNS Mehran, a Pakistani Naval station in Karachi. In June 2011, the U.S. agreed to replace the destroyed aircraft with two new ones. In February 2012, the U.S. delivered two additional P-3Cs to the Pakistan Navy.

On 18 November 2016, during tensions with India, the Pakistan Navy dispatched various ASW units, including P-3Cs, in response to reports of an Indian Navy submarine that was allegedly loitering in close proximity to the Southern territorial waters of Pakistan in the Arabian Sea. This submarine was swiftly intercepted by the Navy Orions and forced away from the territorial boundaries.

===In Somalia===

The Spanish Air Force deployed P-3s to assist the international effort against piracy in Somalia. On 29 October 2008, a Spanish P-3 patrolling Somalia&#x27;s coast reacted to a distress call from an oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden; it overflew the pirate vessels three times, dropping a smoke bomb on each pass, as they attempted to board the tanker. After the third pass, the pirates broke off their attack. On 29 March 2009, the same P-3 pursued the assailants of the German navy tanker , resulting in the pirate&#x27;s capture.

In April 2011, the Portuguese Air Force also contributed to Operation Ocean Shield by sending a P-3C which had early success when on its fifth mission detected a pirate whaler with two attack skiffs. Since 2009, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force has deployed P-3s to Djibouti for anti-piracy patrols, from 2011 from its own base. The German Navy has also periodically contributed a P-3 to address the piracy problem.

===Civilian uses===
Several P-3s have been N-registered and are operated by civilian agencies. The US Customs and Border Protection has several P-3A and P-3B aircraft that are used for aircraft intercept and maritime patrol. NOAA operates two WP-3D variants specially modified for hurricane research. One P-3, N426NA, is used by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as an Earth science research platform, primarily for the NASA Science Mission Directorate&#x27;s Airborne Science Program; it is based at Goddard Space Flight Center&#x27;s Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia.

Aero Union, Inc. operated eight secondhand P-3As configured as air tankers, which were leased to the U.S. Forest Service, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and other agencies for firefighting use. Several of these aircraft were involved in the U.S. Forest Service airtanker scandal but have not been involved in any catastrophic aircraft mishaps. Aero Union has since gone bankrupt, and their P-3s have been put up for auction.

==Variants==
Over the years, numerous variants of the P-3 have been created. A few notable examples are:

*WP-3D: Two P-3C aircraft as modified on the production line for NOAA weather research, including hurricane hunting.
*EP-3E Aries: 10 P-3A and 2 EP-3B aircraft converted into ELINT aircraft.
*EP-3E Aries II: 12 P-3C aircraft converted into ELINT aircraft.
*AP-3C: Royal Australian Air Force P-3C/W aircraft which have been extensively upgraded by L-3 Communications with new mission systems, including an Elta SAR/ISAR radar and a General Dynamics Canada acoustic processor system.
*CP-140M Aurora: maritime reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft for the Canadian Forces. Based on the P-3C Orion airframe, but mounts the more advanced electronics suite of the Lockheed S-3 Viking; 18 built
*CP-140A Arcturus: Three P-3s without ASW equipment for CP-140 Aurora crew training and various coastal patrol missions.
*P-7 proposed new-build and improved variant as a P-3 Orion replacement later canceled.
*Orion 21 proposed new-build and improved variant as a P-3 Orion replacement; lost to the Boeing P-8 Poseidon.
*P-3K2: Royal New Zealand Air Force Six P-3K2 aircraft which have been fully upgraded with totally new mission systems by L-3 Mission Integration Division, Greenville, Texas. The flight deck now has &#x27;glass&#x27; instrumentation and navigation computer automation. The Tactical Rail (Tacrail) has been completely refitted with modern sensors, communication and data management systems.

Korean Air/L-3 Communications upgraded the P-3Cs with new electronics, including magnetic anomaly detectors, electro-optical sensors, surveillance equipment and a self-protection suite. The Navy&#x27;s impetus stems from a 2010 experience in which ROK forces detected only 28% of North Korean submarines involved in exercises.
*Republic of China Air Force (1966–1967) – Three P-3As (149669, 149673, 149678) obtained by the CIA from the U.S. Navy under Project STSPIN in May 1963, as replacement aircraft for CIA&#x27;s own covert operation fleet of RB-69A/P2V-7U versions. Converted by Aerosystems Division of LTV to be used as both ELINT and COMINT platform, the three P-3As were known as &quot;black&quot; P-3As under Project Axial. Officially transferred to the CIA on June/July 1964, the first of three &quot;black&quot; P-3As arrived in Taiwan and officially transferred to ROCAF&#x27;s secret Black Bat Squadron on 22 June 1966. Armed with four Sidewinder short range AAM missiles for self-defense, the three &quot;black&quot; P-3A flew peripheral missions along China&#x27;s coast to collect SIGINT and air samples. When the project was terminated in January 1967, all three &quot;black&quot; P-3As were flown to NAS Alameda, CA, for long-term storage. In September 1967, Lockheed at Burbank, converted two of the three aircraft (149669 and 149678) into the only two EP-3B examples in existence, while the third aircraft (149673) was converted by Lockheed in 1969–1970 to serve as a development aircraft for various electronic programs. The two EP-3Bs known as &quot;Bat Rack&quot;, owing to their service with Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Black Bat&quot; Squadron, were issued to U.S. Navy&#x27;s VQ-1 Squadron in 1969 and deployed to Da Nang, Vietnam. Later, the two EP-3Bs were converted to EP-3E ARIES, along with seven EP-3As. The two EP-3Es retired in the 1980s, when replaced by 12 EP-3E ARIES II versions.
*Republic of China Navy – The Republic of China Navy obtained 12 P-3Cs under the U.S. government&#x27;s Foreign Military Sales program in 2007 which were then modernized for an additional 15,000 flight hours. 12 P-3Cs (ordered, with deliveries starting in 2012), with three spare airframes that may be converting to EP-3E standard; based in the south part of the island and offshore. In May 2014 Lockheed Martin were awarded a contract to upgrade and overhaul all 12 P-3Cs by August 2015.
* United States Navy – Three P-3C and one NP-3D remain in service with VX-30, with another two NP-3C active with VXS-1. The P-3s were replaced in active duty and reserve squadrons by the Boeing P-8 Poseidon.

==Notable events, accidents, and incidents==
* 30 January 1963: A P-3A, BuNo &quot;149762&quot;, was lost at sea in the Atlantic Ocean, 14 crew killed.
* 4 July 1966: A P-3A, BuNo &quot;152172&quot;, construction number 185-5142, assigned to VP-19, Radio call sign Papa Echo Zero Five (PE-05), crashed northeast Battle Creek, MI. It was on the return leg of a cross country training flight from NAS New York-Floyd Bennett Field, New York to NAS Moffett Field, California via NAS Glenview, Illinois; all four crew lost.
* 6 February 1968: A P-3B, BuNo &quot;153440&quot;, construction number 185-5237, assigned to VP-26, crashed during an Operation Market Time combat patrol off Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam. All 12 crew were lost as MIA. Initially attributed to mechanical failure, it was later suggested that it may have been shot down.
* 1 April 1968: A P-3B, Registration &quot;153445&quot;, construction number 185-5241, assigned to VP-26, was shot down by surface anti-aircraft fire during an Operation Market Time combat patrol off Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam. The AAA fire set an engine on fire, and during a subsequent landing attempt, the wing separated and the aircraft crashed, with the loss of all 12 crew.
* 11 April 1968: An RAAF P-3B, Registration &quot;A9-296&quot;, construction number 185-5406, crashed on runway 32L at NAS Moffett Field, California after departing the manufacturer&#x27;s facility during pre-delivery acceptance trials. The left main mount (undercarriage) collapsed upon landing and the aircraft ground-looped. All crew survived without serious injury, but the aircraft was completely destroyed by the resulting fire.
* 6 March 1969: USN P-3A BuNo &quot;152765&quot; tail coded RP-07 of VP-31 crashed at NAS Lemoore, California, at the end of a practice ground control approach (GCA) landing, all six crew died.
* 28 January 1971: Commander Donald H. Lilienthal, USN flew a P-3C Orion to a world speed record for heavyweight turboprops. Over 15–25 kilometers, he reached 501 miles per hour to break the Soviet Il-18&#x27;s May 1968 record of 452 miles per hour.
* 26 May 1972: USN P-3A BuNo &quot;152155&quot; disappeared over the Pacific Ocean on a routine training mission after departing NAS Moffett Field, California, with the loss of eight crew members.
* 3 June 1972: While attempting to fly through the Straits of Gibraltar, &quot;en route&quot; from Naval Station Rota, Spain to Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, a P-3A of VP-44 hit a mountain in Morocco, resulting in the death of all 14 crew on board.
* 12 April 1973: A P-3C, BuNo &quot;157332&quot;, operating from NAS Moffett Field, California collided with a Convair 990 (N711NA) operated by NASA during approach to runway 32L. They crashed on the Sunnyvale Municipal Golf Course, short of the runway, resulting in destruction of both aircraft and the death of all but one crewmember.
* 11 December 1977: USN P-3B BuNo &quot;153428&quot; from VP-11 operating from Lajes Field, Azores crashed on mountainous El Hierro (southwesternmost of the Canary Islands) in poor visibility. There were no survivors from the crew of 13.
* 26 April 1978: USN P-3B BuNo &quot;152724&quot; from VP-23 crashed on landing approach to Lajes Field, Azores. Seven of the crew were killed and the plane sank into deep water preventing recovery to assess the cause of the crash.
* 22 September 1978: USN P-3B BuNo &quot;152757&quot; from VP-8 disintegrated over Poland, Maine on 22 September 1978. An over-pressurized fuel tank caused the port wing to separate at the outboard engine. The detached wing sheared off part of the tail; and aerodynamic forces caused the remaining engines and starboard wing to detach from the fuselage. Debris rained down near the south end of Tripp Pond shortly after 12:00. None of the 8-man crew survived.
* 26 October 1978: USN P-3C, BuNo &quot;159892&quot;, call sign coded AF 586 from VP-9 operating from NAS Adak ditched at sea after an engine fire caused by a propeller malfunction. All but two of the 15-man crew were rescued by a Soviet trawler, but three crew members died of exposure.
* 27 June 1979: A P-3B, BuNo &quot;154596&quot;, from VP-22 operating from NAS Cubi Point Philippines, had a propeller overspeed shortly after departure. The number 4 propeller then departed the aircraft, striking the number three with a subsequent fire on that engine. While attempting an overweight landing with two engines out, the aircraft stalled, rolled inverted and crashed in Subic Bay just past Grande Island. Four crew and one passenger were killed in the crash.
* 17 April 1980: USN P-3C BuNo &quot;158213&quot; from VP-50 while flying for a parachuting exhibition in Pago Pago, American Samoa struck overhead tram wires and crashed, killing all six crew on board.
* 17 May 1983: USN P-3B BuNo &quot;152733&quot; tail coded YB-07 from VP-1 inadvertently landed gear up during a routine dedicated field work (DFW) pilot training flight at NAS Barbers Point. No crew were injured but the aircraft was a total loss. 
* 16 June 1983: USN P-3B, BuNo &quot;152720&quot;, tail coded YB-06 from VP-1 at NAS Barbers Point crashed into a mountain top in fog and low clouds on the Napali Coast between the Hanapu and Kalalau valleys in Kauai, Hawai&#x27;i, killing all 14 on board.
* 6 January 1987: Following a seven-hour P-3 ASW patrol, VP-6&#x27;s Crew Eight initiated restart of the loitered No. 1 engine, 830 nm from NAS Barbers Point. The engine encountered RPM problems and failed to feather and overspeed leading to gearbox issues. After six hours of flight back to Barbers Point and only 12 nm from the runway, the No. 1 prop disconnected and collided with prop No. 2 removing two prop tips. This caused the aircraft to roll violently to the left until prop No. 2 was able to be locked with the prop brake. Despite this, the crew managed to touch down on centerline, 2,000 feet down the runway, completing its landing roll-out with 2,500 feet remaining and all crew surviving. Due to this event, P3 engine oil protocol was adjusted.
* 13 September 1987: A Royal Norwegian Air Force P-3B, tail number &quot;602&quot;, was hit from below by a Russian Sukhoi Su-27 of the 941st IAP V-PVO. The Su-27 flew below the P-3&#x27;s starboard side, then accelerated and pulled up, clipping the #4 engine&#x27;s propellers. The propeller shrapnel hit the P-3B&#x27;s fuselage and caused a decompression. There were no injuries and both aircraft returned safely to base.
* 25 September 1990: The first production P-3C Update III, BuNo &quot;161762&quot;, assigned to VP-31 at NAS Moffett Field, impacted the runway at an excessive rate of descent while conducting at dedicated field work sortie at Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Crows Landing. Both main landing gear failed and the aircraft slid down the runway. Some crewmembers sustained minor injuries, but there were no fatalities. The aircraft was a total loss. 
* 21 March 1991: While on a training mission west of San Diego, California, two USN P-3Cs, BuNos &quot;158930&quot; and &quot;159325&quot;, assigned to VP-50 based at NAS Moffett Field collided in midair, killing all 27 crew on board both aircraft.
* 26 April 1991: An RAAF AP-3C, tail number &quot;A9-754&quot;, lost a wing leading edge and crashed into shallow water in the Cocos Island; one crewman was killed. It was cut up and became an artificial reef.
* 16 October 1991: P-3A &quot;N924AU&quot; of Aero Union crashed into a mountain in Montana, United States killing both crew.
* 25 March 1995: USN P-3C BuNo &quot;158217&quot; assigned to VP-47 was returning from a training mission in the North Arabian Sea when it suffered catastrophic engine failure of the number 4 engine. The aircraft ditched at sea from RAFO Masirah, Oman. All 11 crewmembers were rescued by the Royal Omani Air Force.
* 1 April 2001: An aerial collision known as the Hainan Island incident between a USN EP-3E ARIES II, BuNo &quot;156511&quot;, a signals reconnaissance version of the P-3C, and a People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy J-8IIM fighter resulted in the J-8IIM crashing and its pilot was killed. The EP-3 came close to becoming uncontrollable, at one point sustaining a near inverted roll, but was able to make an emergency landing on Hainan.
* 20 April 2005: P-3B &quot;N926AU&quot; of Aero Union crashed while conducting practice drops of water over an area of rugged mountainous terrain located north of the Chico Airport. All three crew on board were killed.
* 21 October 2008: P-3C USN &quot;158573&quot; On landing, the aircraft overrun runway and lost its right landing gear. Nobody was injured but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. 
* 22 May 2011: Twenty Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan militants claiming to avenge Osama bin Laden&#x27;s death destroyed two Pakistan Navy P-3Cs during an armed attack at PNS Mehran, a Pakistan Navy base in Karachi. They had been frequently used to conduct overland counter-insurgency surveillance operations.
* 15 February 2014: Three USN P-3Cs were crushed beyond repair when their hangar, at NAF Atsugi, Japan, was destroyed by a massive snow storm.

<text>Lauryn Noelle Hill (born May 26, 1975) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. She is celebrated as one of the most influential musical artists of her generation. Hill is credited with breaking barriers for female rappers, contributing to the mainstream success of both hip-hop and neo soul, and blending rap with melodic vocals. She has been honored as one of the &quot;50 Great Voices&quot; by NPR, and one of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; named her the greatest female rapper. Among her accolades are eight Grammy Awards—the most for any female rapper.

Hill began her career as a teen actress, appearing in &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1991) and Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s drama film &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (1993). Her performance as Rita in the film &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; (1993) earned widespread praise. Hill gained further prominence as the frontwoman of the Fugees, which she formed in 1990 with Wyclef Jean and Pras. Their second album, &quot;The Score&quot; (1996), topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and made Hill the first woman to win a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. The album featured the hit single &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, which became the best-selling single of 1996 in multiple regions, including the UK. Its popularity was so immense that it was pulled from stores to prioritize the release of &quot;Ready or Not&quot;. Around the same time, she collaborated with Nas on the single &quot;If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)&quot;.

Her debut solo album, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; (1998), opened at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 to widespread critical acclaim. Its lead single, &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;, debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making Hill the first artist to debut at No. 1 on both charts with their first entries. The song was later recognized as a Song of the Century. &quot;The Miseducation&quot; became the first recording by a female rapper to receive a diamond certification (RIAA), and included standout tracks such as &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, &quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot;, and &quot;Lost Ones&quot;. At the 41st Grammy Awards, she became the first rapper to win Album of the Year. The album remains one of the best-selling albums worldwide and topped Apple Music&#x27;s 100 Best Albums list. 

In 1999, Hill became the first rapper to appear on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. Later that year, her duet with the late Bob Marley, &quot;Turn Your Lights Down Low&quot;, reached the top ten internationally. In 2002, Hill&#x27;s Grammy-nominated live album &quot;MTV Unplugged No. 2.0&quot;, debuted in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top five and achieved platinum status. In the years following, she collaborated with John Legend and Nas on songs like &quot;So High (remix)&quot; and &quot;Nobody&quot;, while also remaining an active touring artist. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranks her as the second highest-grossing female rapper in live music history.

Hill has contributed as a producer and songwriter to projects by Whitney Houston, CeCe Winans, and her son YG Marley, as well as Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;All That I Can Say&quot; and Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;A Rose Is Still a Rose&quot;, a Top 40 hit that became Franklin&#x27;s final signature song. She also co-produced Santana&#x27;s juggernaut album &quot;Supernatural&quot; (1999), for which she won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Her influence has been recognized with honors including the ASCAP Golden Note Award, the NAACP President&#x27;s Award, and inductions into the Grammy Hall of Fame (twice), the National Recording Registry, and the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

==Life and career==

=== 1975–1990: Early life ===
Lauryn Noelle Hill was born on May 26, 1975, in East Orange, New Jersey. Her mother, Valerie Hill, was an English teacher and her father, Mal Hill, a computer and management consultant. She has one older brother named Malaney who was born in 1972. Her Baptist family moved to New York for a short period before settling in South Orange.

Hill has said of her musically oriented family: &quot;there were so many records, so much music constantly being played. My mother played the piano, my father sang, and we were always surrounded by music.&quot; Her father sang in local nightclubs and at weddings. While growing up, Hill frequently listened to Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, and Gladys Knight; years later she recalled playing Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; repeatedly until she fell asleep to it.

In middle school, Hill performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before a basketball game. Due to its popularity, subsequent games featured a recording of her rendition. In 1988, Hill appeared as an Amateur Night contestant on &quot;It&#x27;s Showtime at the Apollo&quot;. She sang her version of the Smokey Robinson track &quot;Who&#x27;s Lovin&#x27; You&quot;. Stumbling out of the gate to hit her notes, she initially garnered a mixed reaction from the crowd, but persevered through the performance, which ended in applause.

Hill attended Columbia High School, where she was a member of the track team, cheerleading squad and was a classmate of actor Zach Braff. She also took violin lessons, went to dance class, and founded the school&#x27;s gospel choir. Academically, she took advanced placement classes and received primarily &#x27;A&#x27; grades. School officials recognized her as a leader among the student body. Later recalling her education, Hill commented, &quot;I had a love for—I don&#x27;t know if it was necessarily for academics, more than it just was for achieving, period. If it was academics, if it was sports, if it was music, if it was dance, whatever it was, I was always driven to do a lot in whatever field or whatever area I was focusing on at the moment.&quot;

===1991–1993: Career beginnings===
While a freshman in high school, through mutual friends, Prakazrel &quot;Pras&quot; Michel approached Hill about a music group he was creating. Hill and Pras began under the name Translator Crew. They came up with this name because they wanted to rhyme in different languages. Another female vocalist was soon replaced by Michel&#x27;s cousin, multi-instrumentalist Wyclef Jean. The group began performing in local showcases and high school talent shows. Hill was initially only a singer, but then learned to rap too; instead of modeling herself on female rappers like Salt-N-Pepa and MC Lyte, she preferred male rappers like Ice Cube and developed her flow from listening to them. Hill later said, &quot;I remember doing my homework in the bathroom stalls of hip-hop clubs.&quot;

While growing up, Hill took acting lessons in Manhattan. She began her acting career in 1991 appearing with Jean in &quot;Club XII&quot;, MC Lyte&#x27;s Off-Broadway hip-hop rendering of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. While the play was not a success, an agent noticed her. Later that year, Hill began appearing on the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in a recurring role as troubled teenager Kira Johnson. She subsequently co-starred alongside Whoopi Goldberg in the 1993 release &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot;, playing Rita Louise Watson, an inner-city Catholic school teenager with a surly, rebellious attitude. In it, she performed the songs &quot;His Eye Is on the Sparrow&quot; (a duet with Tanya Blount) and &quot;Joyful, Joyful&quot;.

Director Bill Duke credited Hill with improvising a rap in a scene: &quot;None of that was scripted. That was all Lauryn. She was amazing.&quot; Critic Roger Ebert called her &quot;the girl with the big joyful voice&quot;, although he thought her talent was wasted, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said she &quot;performed marvelously against type ... in the otherwise perfunctory [film]&quot;. Hill also appeared in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 1993 motion picture &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, in a minor but pivotal role as a 1930s gum-popping elevator operator. Soderbergh biographer Jason Wood described her as supplying one of the warmest scenes in the film. Hill graduated from Columbia High School in 1993.

===1994–1996: Success with the Fugees and motherhood===
Pras, Hill and Jean renamed their group Fugees, a derivative of the word &quot;refugee&quot;, which was a derogatory term for Haitian Americans. Hill began a romantic relationship with Jean. The Fugees, who signed a contract with Columbia/Ruffhouse Records in 1993, became known for their genre blending, particularly of reggae, rock and soul, which was first experimented on their debut album, &quot;Blunted on Reality&quot;, released in 1994. It reached No. 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart but overall sold poorly and was met by poor critical reviews due to their management&#x27;s insistence they adopt gangsta rap attitudes. Although the album made little impact, Hill&#x27;s rapping on &quot;Some Seek Stardom&quot; was seen as a highlight. Within the group, she was frequently referred to by the nickname &quot;L. Boogie&quot;. Hill&#x27;s image and artistry, as well as her full, rich, raspy alto voice, placed her at the forefront of the band, with some fans urging her to begin a solo career.

The Fugees&#x27; second album, &quot;The Score&quot; (1996), peaked at No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and stayed in the top ten of that chart for over half a year. It sold about seven million copies in the United States and more than 20 million copies worldwide. In the 1996 Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll, &quot;The Score&quot; came second in the list of best albums and three of its tracks placed within the top 20 best singles. It won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and was later included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. &quot;The Score&quot; garnered praise for being a strong alternative to the gangsta idiom, and Hill stated, &quot;We&#x27;re trying to do something positive with the music because it seems like only the negative is rising to the top these days. It only takes a drop of purity to clean a cesspool.&quot;

Singles from &quot;The Score&quot; included &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot; and &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, which highlighted Hill&#x27;s singing and rapping abilities, and the Bob Marley cover &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;. Her rendition of &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; became the group&#x27;s breakout hit. Buttressed by what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; publications later called Hill&#x27;s &quot;evocative&quot; vocal line and her &quot;amazing pipes&quot;, the track became pervasive on pop, R&amp;B, hip hop, and adult contemporary radio formats. It won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. On the album, Hill combined African-American music and Caribbean music influences with socially conscious lyrics. &quot;Newsweek&quot; mentioned Hill&#x27;s &quot;irresistibly cute looks&quot; and proclaimed her &quot;the most powerful new voice in rap&quot;.

When she was 21 years old, Hill was still living at home with her parents. She had been enrolled at Columbia University during this period, and considered majoring in history as she became a sophomore, but left after about a year of total studies once sales of &quot;The Score&quot; went into the millions. In 1996, she responded to a false rumor on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; that she had made a racist comment on MTV, saying &quot;How can I possibly be a racist? My music is universal. And I believe in God. If I believe in God, then I have to love all of God&#x27;s creations. There can be no segregation.&quot;

In 1996, Hill founded the Refugee Project, a non-profit outreach organization that sought to transform the attitudes and behavior of at-risk urban youth. Part of this was Camp Hill, which offered stays in the Catskill Mountains for such youngsters; another was production of an annual Halloween haunted house in East Orange. Hill also raised money for Haitian refugees, supported clean water well-building projects in Kenya and Uganda, and staged a rap concert in Harlem to promote voter registration. A 1997 benefit event for the Refugee Project introduced a board of trustees for the organization that included Sean Combs, Mariah Carey, Busta Rhymes, Spike Lee, and others as members.

In 1997, the Fugees split to work on solo projects, which Jean later blamed on his tumultuous relationship with Hill and the fact he married his wife Claudinette while still involved with Hill. Meanwhile, in the summer of 1996 Hill had met Rohan Marley, a son of Bob Marley and a former University of Miami football player. Hill subsequently began a relationship with him, while still also involved with Jean. Hill became pregnant in late 1996, and on August 3, 1997, Marley and Hill&#x27;s first child, Zion David, was born. The couple lived in Hill&#x27;s childhood house in South Orange after she bought her parents a new house down the street.

Hill had a cameo appearance in the 1997 film &quot;Hav Plenty&quot;. In 1998, Hill took up another small, but important role in the film &quot;Restaurant&quot;; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised her portrayal of the protagonist&#x27;s pregnant former girlfriend as bringing vigor to the film.

===1997–1999: &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;===
Hill recorded her solo record &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; from late 1997 through June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Jamaica. The title was inspired by the book &quot;The Mis-Education of the Negro&quot; (1933) by Carter G. Woodson and &quot;The Education of Sonny Carson&quot;, a film and autobiographical novel. The album featured contributions from D&#x27;Angelo, Carlos Santana, Mary J. Blige and the then-unknown John Legend. Wyclef Jean initially did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered his production help; Hill turned him down.

Several songs on the album concerned her frustration with the Fugees; &quot;I Used to Love Him&quot; dealt with the breakdown of the relationship between Hill and Wyclef Jean. Other songs such as &quot;To Zion&quot; spoke about her decision to have her first baby (Zion David Marley, the first of five she was to have with Rohan Marley), even though some at the time encouraged her to have an abortion so to not interfere with her blossoming career. Indeed, Hill&#x27;s pregnancy revived her from a period of writer&#x27;s block.

In terms of production, Hill collaborated with a group of musicians known as New Ark, consisting of Vada Nobles, Rasheem Pugh, Tejumold Newton, and Johari Newton. Hill later said that she wanted to &quot;write songs that lyrically move me and have the integrity of reggae and the knock of hip-hop and the instrumentation of classic soul&quot; and that the production on the album was intended to make the music sound raw and not computer-aided. Hill spoke of pressure from her label to emulate Prince, wherein all tracks would be credited as written and produced by the artist with little outside help. She also wanted to be appreciated as an auteur as much as Jean had within the Fugees. She also saw a feminist cause: &quot;But step out and try and control things and there are doubts. This is a very sexist industry. They&#x27;ll never throw the &#x27;genius&#x27; title to a sister.&quot; While recording the album, when Hill was asked about providing contracts or documentation to the musicians, she replied, &quot;We all love each other. This ain&#x27;t about documents. This is blessed.&quot;

Released on August 25, 1998, the album received rave reviews from contemporary music critics, and was the most acclaimed album of 1998. Critics lauded the album&#x27;s blending of the R&amp;B, doo-wop, pop, hip-hop, and reggae genres and its honest representation of a woman&#x27;s life and relationships. David Browne, writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, called it &quot;an album of often-astonishing power, strength, and feeling&quot;, and praised Hill for &quot;easily flowing from singing to rapping, evoking the past while forging a future of her own&quot;. Robert Christgau quipped, &quot; record of the year—songs soft, singing ordinary, rapping skilled, rhymes up and down, skits , production subtle and terrific&quot;. In 2017, NPR rated the album as the second-best album of all time created by a woman.

It sold nearly 423,000 copies in its first week (boosted by advance radio play of two non-label-sanctioned singles, &quot;Lost Ones&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot;) and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for four weeks and the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Albums chart for six weeks. It went on to sell about 10 million copies in the United States, and 20 million copies worldwide. During 1998 and 1999, Hill earned $25 million from record sales and touring. Hill, along with Blige, Missy Elliott, Meshell Ndegeocello, Erykah Badu, and others, found a voice with the neo soul genre.

The first single released from the album was &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;, which debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It exemplified Hill&#x27;s appeal, combining feelings of self-empowerment with self-defense. Other charted singles from the album were &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, which has been sampled by Drake and Cardi B, &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot; and &quot;To Zion&quot;. In the 1998 Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll, &quot;Miseducation&quot; came second in the list of best albums and &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; second in best singles.

In November 1998, Marley and Hill&#x27;s second child, Selah Louise, was born. Of being a young mother of two, Hill said, &quot;It&#x27;s not an easy situation at all. You have to really pray and be honest with yourself.&quot;

In the run-up to the 1999 Grammy Awards, Hill became the first woman to be nominated in ten categories in a single year. In addition to &quot;Miseducation&quot; works, the nominations included her rendition of &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; for the 1997 film &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;, which had appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and Hill&#x27;s writing and producing of &quot;A Rose Is Still a Rose&quot;, which became a late-in-career hit for Aretha Franklin. She appeared on several magazine covers, including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Teen People&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. During the ceremony, Hill broke another record by becoming the first woman to win five times in one night, taking home the awards for Album of the Year, Best R&amp;B Album, Best R&amp;B Song, Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance, and Best New Artist. During an acceptance speech, she said, &quot;This is crazy. This is hip-hop!&quot; Hill had brought forth a new, mainstream acceptance of the genre.

In February 1999, Hill received four awards at the 30th Annual NAACP Image Awards. In May 1999, she became the youngest woman ever named to &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100+ Most Influential Black Americans list; in November of that year, the same publication named her as one of &quot;10 For Tomorrow&quot; in the &quot;Ebony 2000: Special Millennium Issue&quot;. In May 1999, she made &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People list. The publication, which has called her &quot;model-gorgeous&quot;, praised the Hill for her idiosyncratic sense of personal style. In June 1999, she received an Essence Award, but her acceptance speech, where she said there was no contradiction in religious love and servitude and &quot;[being] who you are, as fly and as hot and as whatever&quot;, drew reaction from those in the public who thought she was not a good role model as a young, unwed mother of two. This was a repetition of criticism she had received after the birth of her first child, and she had said that she and Marley would soon be married. In early 2000, Hill was one of the producers to share the Grammy Award for Album of the Year awarded for Santana&#x27;s 1999 multi-million-selling &quot;Supernatural&quot;, whereon she had written, produced, and rapped on the track &quot;Do You Like the Way&quot; (a rumination on the direction the world was headed, it also featured the singing of CeeLo Green and the signature guitar runs of Carlos Santana). She was also nominated for Best R&amp;B Song for &quot;All That I Can Say&quot;, which she had written and produced for Mary J. Blige. Also, her concocted duet with Bob Marley on &quot;Turn Your Lights Down Low&quot; for the 1999 remix tribute album &quot;Chant Down Babylon&quot; additionally appeared in the 1999 film &quot;The Best Man&quot; and later received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

In November 1998, New Ark filed a fifty-page lawsuit against Hill, her management, and record label, claiming that Hill &quot;used their songs and production skills, but failed to properly credit them for the work&quot; on &quot;Miseducation&quot;. The musicians claimed to be the primary songwriters on two tracks, and major contributors on several others, though Gordon Williams, a prominent recorder, engineer, and mixer on &quot;Miseducation&quot;, described the album as a &quot;powerfully personal effort by Hill&quot; and said, &quot;It was definitely her vision.&quot; Hill responded that New Ark had been appropriately credited and now were seeking to take advantage of her success. New Ark requested partial writing credits on most of the tracks on the album as well as monetary reimbursement. After many delays, depositions took place during the latter part of 2000. In part, the case illustrated the difficult boundaries between songwriting and all other aspects that went into contemporary arranging, sampling, and recording. The suit was eventually settled out of court in February 2001, with Hill paying New Ark a reported $5 million. A friend of Hill&#x27;s later said of the suit, &quot;That was the beginning of a chain effect that would turn everything a little crazy.&quot;

===2000–2003: Self-imposed exile and &quot;MTV Unplugged No. 2.0&quot;===
Hill began writing a screenplay about the life of Bob Marley, in the production of which she planned to play his wife Rita. She also began producing a romantic comedy about soul food with a working title of &quot;Sauce&quot;, and accepted a starring role in the film adaptation of Toni Morrison&#x27;s novel &quot;Beloved&quot;; she later dropped out of both projects due to pregnancy. She also reportedly turned down acting roles in the remake for &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (the movie was later released in 2018, with the part going to Lady Gaga), &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (the role of Deena, later played by Beyoncé), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (the part that went to Lucy Liu), &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, &quot;The Mexican&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;.

In 2000, Hill dropped out of the public eye. The pressures of fame began to overwhelm her. She disliked not being able to go out of her house to do simple errands without having to worry about her physical appearance. She fired her management team and began attending Bible study classes five days a week; she also stopped doing interviews, watching television, and listening to music. She started associating with a &quot;spiritual advisor&quot; named Brother Anthony. Some familiar with Hill believe Anthony more resembled a cult leader than a spiritual advisor, and thought his guidance probably inspired much of Hill&#x27;s more controversial public behavior.

She later described this period of her life to &quot;Essence&quot; saying &quot;People need to understand that the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time ... I had to step away when I realized that for the sake of the machine, I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone&#x27;s face when I really didn&#x27;t like them or even know them well enough to like them.&quot; She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, &quot;For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture.&quot; She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced &quot;to deal with folks who weren&#x27;t happy about that.&quot;

In July 2001, while pregnant with her third child, Hill unveiled her new material to a small crowd, for a taping of an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; special. A live album of the concert, titled &quot;MTV Unplugged No. 2.0&quot;, was released in May 2002 and featured only her singing and playing an acoustic guitar. Unlike the near-unanimous praise of &quot;Miseducation&quot;, &quot;2.0&quot; sharply divided critics. AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, saying that the recording &quot;is the unfinished, unflinching presentation of ideas and of a person. It may not be a proper follow-up to her first album, but it is fascinating.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;a public breakdown&quot;, and Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the album&#x27;s title opened Hill up for jokes that she had become unhinged. &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Unplugged 2.0&quot; is a sparse and often gruelling listen, but there is enough genius shading these rough sketches to suggest that all might not yet be lost.&quot; With the mixed reviews and no significant radio airplay, &quot;2.0&quot; debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was later certified Platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA.

Her song &quot;Mystery of Iniquity&quot; from the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance, and was used as an interpolation by Kanye West for his single &quot;All Falls Down&quot; featuring Syleena Johnson, leading to Hill being credited as a songwriter on the song.

Around 2001, Marley and Hill&#x27;s third child, Joshua Omaru, was born. He was followed a year later by their fourth, John Nesta. While Hill sometimes had spoken of Marley as her husband, they never married, and along the way she was informed that Marley had been previously married at a young age. According to a 2003 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; report, he had never secured a divorce. Marley later disputed this and made public to a blog a 1996 divorce document from Haiti. The two had been living in a high-end Miami hotel, but around 2003 she moved out into her own place in that city. Hill later said that she and Marley &quot;have had long periods of separation over the years&quot;. Hill slowly worked on a new album and it was reported that by 2003, Columbia Records had spent more than $2.5 million funding it, including installing a recording studio in the singer&#x27;s Miami apartment and flying different musicians around the country.

By 2002, Hill had shut down her non-profit Refugee Project. She said, &quot;I had a nonprofit organization and I had to shut all that down. You know, smiling with big checks, obligatory things, not having things come from a place of passion. That&#x27;s slavery. Everything we do should be a result of our gratitude for what God has done for us. It should be passionate.&quot;

In December 2003, Hill, during a performance in Vatican City, spoke of the &quot;corruption, exploitation, and abuses&quot; in reference to the molestation of boys by Catholic priests in the United States and the cover-up of offenses by Catholic Church officials. High-ranking church officials were in attendance, but Pope John Paul II was not present. The Catholic League called Hill &quot;pathologically miserable&quot; and claimed her career was &quot;in decline&quot;. The following day, several reporters suggested that Hill&#x27;s comments at the Vatican may have been influenced by her spiritual advisor, Brother Anthony.

===2004–2009: Sporadic touring and recording===

In 2004, Hill contributed a new song, &quot;The Passion&quot;, to &quot;The Passion of the Christ: Songs&quot;. A remix version with John Legend of his &quot;So High&quot; ended up receiving a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Around this time, Hill began selling a pay-per-view music video of the song &quot;Social Drugs&quot; through her website. Those who purchase the $15 video would only be able to view it three times before it expired. In addition to the video, Hill began selling autographed posters and Polaroids through her website, with some items listed at upwards of $500.

For the first time since 1997, the Fugees performed in September 2004 at &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot; in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The concert featured Hill&#x27;s nearly a cappella rendition of &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;. The event was recorded by director Michel Gondry and was released on March 3, 2006, to universal acclaim. The Fugees also appeared at BET Awards 2005 during June 2005, where they opened the show with a 12-minute set. One track, &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, was leaked online and thereafter was released as an Internet single in late September. It peaked at No. 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Chart.

In 2005, she told &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children. If other people benefit from it, then so be it.&quot; When asked how she now felt about the songs on &quot;2.0&quot;, she stated &quot;a lot of the songs were transitional. The music was about how I was feeling at the time, even though I was documenting my distress as well as my bursts of joy.&quot;

The Fugees embarked on a European tour in late 2005. Old tensions between Hill and the other members of the group soon resurfaced, and the reunion ended before an album could be recorded; Jean and Michel both blamed Hill for the split. Hill reportedly demanded to be addressed by everyone, including her bandmates, as &quot;Ms. Hill&quot;; she also considered changing her moniker to &quot;Empress&quot;. Hill&#x27;s tardiness was also cited as a contributing factor.

Hill began touring on her own, although to mixed reviews; often arriving late to concerts (sometimes by over two hours), performing unpopular reconfigurations of her songs and sporting an exaggerated appearance. On some occasions, fans booed her and left early. In June 2007, Sony Records said Hill had been recording through the past decade, had accumulated considerable unreleased material and had re-entered the studio with the goal of making a new album. Later that same year, an album titled &quot;Ms. Hill&quot;, which featured cuts from &quot;Miseducation&quot;, various soundtrack contributions and other &quot;unreleased&quot; songs, was released. It features guest appearances from D&#x27;Angelo, Rah Digga and John Forté. Also in June 2007, Hill released a new song, &quot;Lose Myself&quot;, on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;.

In early 2008, Marley and Hill&#x27;s fifth child, Sara, was born. The couple were not living together, although Marley considered them &quot;spiritually together&quot; even while listing himself as single on social media. Hill later said that she and Marley &quot;have [had] a long and complex history about which many inaccuracies have been reported since the beginning&quot; and that they both valued their privacy. By August 2008, Hill was living with her mother and children in her hometown of South Orange, New Jersey.

Reports in mid-2008 claimed that Columbia Records then believed Hill to be on hiatus. Marley disputed these claims, telling an interviewer that Hill has enough material for several albums: &quot;She writes music in the bathroom, on toilet paper, on the wall. She writes it in the mirror if the mirror smokes up. She writes constantly. This woman does not sleep&quot;. One of the few public appearances Hill made in 2008 was at a Martha Stewart book signing in New Jersey, perplexing some in the press.

In April 2009, it was reported that Hill would engage in a 10-day tour of European summer festivals during mid-July of that year. She performed two shows for the tour and passed out on stage during the start of her second performance and left the stage. She refused to provide refunds for angry consumers. On June 10, Hill&#x27;s management informed the promoters of the Stockholm Jazz Festival, which she was scheduled to headline, that she would not be performing due to unspecified &quot;health reasons&quot;. Shortly afterward, the rest of the tour was canceled as well.

===2010–2022: Further activities and imprisonment===
In January 2010, Hill returned to the live stage and performed in stops across New Zealand and Australia on the Raggamuffin Music Festival. Many of the songs that Hill had performed and recorded over the past six years were included on an April 2010 unofficial compilation album titled &quot;Khulami Phase&quot;. The album also features a range of other material found on the &quot;Ms. Hill&quot; compilation. Hill appeared at the Harmony Festival in Santa Rosa, California, in June 2010, her first live American performance in several years. An unreleased song called &quot;Repercussions&quot; was leaked via the Internet in late July 2010, debuting at No. 94 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs (and peaked at No. 83 the following week), making it her first &quot;Billboard&quot; chart appearance as a lead artist since 1999.
Hill joined the Rock the Bells hip-hop festival series in the U.S. during August 2010, and as part of that year&#x27;s theme of rendering classic albums, she performed &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; in its entirety for the first time. She increased the tempo and urgency from the original recording, but at times had difficulty in communicating with her band. Hill continued touring, including a set at the 6th Annual Jazz in the Gardens, in Miami Gardens, Florida in December. In Spring 2011, Hill performed at the Coachella Valley Music Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, and at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. In July 2011, Hill gave birth to her sixth child, Micah, her first not with Rohan Marley; the father remains publicly unknown.

In February 2012, Hill performed a new song titled &quot;Fearless Vampire Killer&quot;, during a sold-out performance at the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. In late 2012, Hill toured with rapper Nas; her portion of the tour, titled Black Rage, is named after her song, released October 30. Hill has described the song as being &quot;about the derivative effects of racial inequity and abuse&quot; and &quot;a juxtaposition to the statement &#x27;life is good,&#x27; which she believes can only be so when these long standing issues are addressed and resolved.&quot;

In June 2012, Hill was charged with three counts of tax fraud or failing to file taxes (Title 26 USC § 7202 Willful failure to collect or pay over tax) not tax evasion on $1.8 million of income earned between 2005 and 2007. During this time she had toured as a musical artist, earned royalties from both her records and from films she had appeared in, and had owned and been in charge of multiple corporations. In a long post to her Tumblr, Hill said that she had gone &quot;underground&quot; and had rejected pop culture&#x27;s &quot;climate of hostility, false entitlement, manipulation, racial prejudice, sexism, and ageism.&quot; She added, &quot;When I was working consistently without being affected by the interferences mentioned above, I filed and paid my taxes. This only stopped when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family.&quot;

In June 2012, Hill appeared in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark and pleaded guilty to the charges. Her attorney said she would make restitution for the back taxes she owed. By April 2013, Hill had paid back only $50,000 of the $554,000 she owed immediately. U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo criticized Hill, saying &quot;This is not someone who stands before the court penniless. This is a criminal matter. Actions speak louder than words, and there has been no effort here to pay these taxes.&quot; Hill faced possible eviction from her rented home in South Orange as well as a civil lawsuit from the town for running a business out of a home without a zoning permit.

On May 4, 2013, Hill released her first official single in over a decade, &quot;Neurotic Society (Compulsory Mix)&quot;. She later published a message on her Tumblr describing how she was &quot;required to release [it] immediately, by virtue of the impending legal deadline&quot;. The release received some criticism for lyrics that appeared to tie societal decay to certain LGBT social movements. Hill responded that the song was not targeted at any particular group but was instead focused on anyone hiding behind neurotic behavior. Following a deal with Sony Music, which involves Hill creating a new record label within the company, Hill was said to be scheduled to release her first album in fifteen years during 2013.

On May 6, 2013, Hill was sentenced by Judge Arleo to serve three months in prison for failing to file taxes/tax fraud and three months&#x27; house arrest afterwards as part of a year of supervised probation. She had faced a possible sentence of as long as 36 months, and the sentence given took into account her lack of a prior criminal record and her six minor-aged children. By this point Hill had fully paid back $970,000 in back taxes and penalties she owed, which also took into account an additional $500,000 that Hill had in unreported income for 2008 and 2009. In the courtroom, Hill said that she had lived &quot;very modestly&quot; considering how much money she had made for others, and that &quot;I am a child of former slaves who had a system imposed on them. I had an economic system imposed on me.&quot; Hill reported to the minimum-security Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury on July 8, 2013, to begin serving her sentence.

Hill was released from prison on October 4, 2013, a few days early for good behavior, and began her home confinement and probationary periods. She put out a single called &quot;Consumerism&quot; that she had finished, via verbal and e-mailed instructions, while incarcerated. Judge Arleo allowed her to postpone part of her confinement in order to tour in late 2013 under strict conditions.

During 2014, Hill was heard as the narrator of &quot;Concerning Violence&quot;, an award-winning Swedish documentary on the African liberation struggles of the 1960s and 1970s. She also continued to draw media attention for her erratic behavior, appearing late twice in the same day for sets at Voodoo Fest in November 2014.

In May 2015, Hill canceled her scheduled concert outside Tel Aviv in Israel following a social media campaign from activists promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. She said she had wanted to also perform a show in Ramallah in the West Bank but logistical problems had proved too great. Hill stated: &quot;It is very important to me that my presence or message not be misconstrued, or a source of alienation to either my Israeli or my Palestinian fans.&quot;

Hill contributed her voice to the soundtrack for &quot;What Happened, Miss Simone?&quot;, a 2015 documentary about the life of Nina Simone, an American singer, pianist, and civil rights activist. Hill was originally supposed to record only two songs for the record, but ended up recording six. She also served as a producer on the compilation alongside Robert Glasper. Hill said of her connection to Simone: &quot;Because I fed on this music ... I believed I always had a right to have a voice. Her example is clearly a form of sustenance to a generation needing to find theirs. What a gift.&quot; NPR critically praised Hill&#x27;s performance on the soundtrack, stating: &quot;This album mainly showcases Lauryn Hill&#x27;s breadth and dexterity. Not formally marketed as Hill&#x27;s comeback album, her six tracks here make this her most comprehensive set of studio recordings since &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; in 1998.&quot;

In April 2016, Hill hosted and headlined what was billed as the inaugural &quot;Diaspora Calling!&quot; festival at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn. The festival&#x27;s purpose was to showcase the efforts of musicians and artists from around the African diaspora like Brooklyn Haitian Rara band Brother High Full Tempo. The following month, Hill was approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes late for her show at the Chastain Park Amphitheatre in Atlanta, though members of Hill&#x27;s team claimed it was only an hour after their scheduled start time. Moments after the less-than-40-minute show ended due to the venue&#x27;s strict 11:00 p.m. closing time, Hill said her driver had gotten lost and she could not help that. Less than 48 hours later, after a large backlash from her fans on Twitter, she took to her Facebook page and stated she was late for the concert because of certain needs, including her need to &quot;align her energy with the time&quot;.

Hill recorded a studio version of her song, &quot;Guarding the Gates&quot;, for the movie &quot;Queen &amp; Slim&quot;, which was released on November 27, 2019. This song appears on the album, &quot;Queen &amp; Slim: The Soundtrack&quot;.

=== 2023–present: Fugees reunion tour controversy ===
On April 14, 2024, Lauryn Hill made her return to the stage at Coachella. Hill&#x27;s son, YG Marley, was performing when Hill surprised the crowd by making an appearance. Hill performed several solo songs from her career, but was also reunited with former Fugees bandmate, Wyclef Jean, to perform numerous beloved hit songs.

The Fugees were scheduled to start a reunion tour in August 2024 but the U.S. dates were quietly canceled three days before the first show, with no reason given to customers receiving refunds, but Hill cited &quot;clickbait headlines&quot; and low-ticket sales as an explanation. The cancellations received media scrutiny, to which Hill responded &quot;I can assure you that no one is more disappointed about not being able to perform than I am.&quot; Pras released a diss track titled &quot;Bar Mitzfa&quot; which criticized Hill that same month. In October 2024, Pras sued Hill for breach of contract and fraud, accusing her of mismanaging the budgeting of their tour in &quot;a veiled and devious attempt to make a big score for herself&quot;. Hill responded to each of the claims made in the lawsuit on Instagram, and said it &quot;is full of false claims and unwarranted attacks. It notably omits that he was advanced overpayment for the last tour and has failed to repay substantial loans extended by myself as an act of good will.&quot;

She sings on the 2024 concept album by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Eisa Davis, &quot;Warriors&quot;.

== Other ventures ==

=== Fashion and endorsements ===
Well known for styling her hair in locs, braids, bantu knots and afros, Hill is often associated with the revival of the natural hair movement. She has been credited as one of the people who have helped normalize locs, and introduced them to pop culture. Author Joan Morgan noted that &quot;for a young person who was growing up in the &#x27;90s and liked that natural look but didn&#x27;t want to identify as Rasta, there was really no example until Lauryn Hill.&quot; Hill is also frequently listed among the people who have defined modern bantu knots and afros. &quot;Ebony&quot; noted that she &quot;helped to usher in a new standard of beauty for Black women -one grounded in the richness and authenticity of their African heritage.&quot;

PopSugar placed her on their list of the &quot;18 Moments in Hair History That Changed the World&quot;, and wrote, &quot;When searching for the originator in the recent natural hair revival, you must look to Lauryn Hill. She emerged as the feminine lead in The Fugees and broke Grammy records as a soloist, all while popularizing dreadlocks in the mainstream.&quot; &quot;Stylist&quot; mentioned Hill gracing the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in locs, and being named one of &quot;People&quot;&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People in 1999, as one of the most definitive moments in the history of black hair.

In an interview with &quot;Vogue&quot;, R&amp;B singer SZA, stated &quot;The only girl that I could look to for natural hair inspiration growing up was Lauryn Hill.&quot; According to celebrity hairstylist Yusef Williams, who styled Rihanna&#x27;s hair on the set of &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot;, the singer &quot;channeled her inner Lauryn Hill&quot; while wearing locs for her role in the movie. Halle Bailey named Hill as one of her beauty icons, while mentioning &quot;I love Lauryn Hill&#x27;s hair&quot;.

In 1999, Hill partnered with Levi Strauss &amp; Co. to create custom outfits for her &quot;Miseducation Tour&quot;. Journalist Thembisa Mshaka of &quot;Okayplayer&quot; wrote: &quot;when Levi Strauss put its name next to Lauryn Hill, a new course was charted. The Fortune 500 brand partnerships with black musicians that are ubiquitous today were seeded by the success of Lauryn&#x27;s solo debut&quot;. A custom ensemble made for Hill by Levi&#x27;s was put on display during the &quot;Levi Strauss: A History of American Style&quot; exhibit at the Contemporary Jewish Museum. Hill also partnered with Armani during the late 1990s; the brand designed multiple custom looks for Hill and helped sponsored her &quot;Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; tour. A design created by Armani for the tour was on put display for the 1999 &quot;Rock Style&quot; themed Met Gala.

=== Impact ===
In 2015, &quot;Vogue&quot; mentioned her as one of the female hip hop entertainers of 1990s, whose style they considered to be influential to 2010s fashion, with Emily Barasch of &quot;Vogue&quot;, writing &quot;Lauryn Hill&#x27;s sense of style endures today, as nineties nostalgia continues to pervade the runways.&quot; She was hailed as a &quot;fashion and music icon&quot; by &quot;CR Fashion Book&quot; and was also included on the list of the most stylish rappers of all time by Complex.

She is often named as a leading contributor in the modern popularization of the hoop earring, which first grew in popularity among black women in the 1970s, before reaching a wider audience after female hip hop artists like Hill wore them in the 1980s and 1990s. Considered as an inspiration for Kanye West&#x27;s fashion, singer Solange Knowles also cited Hill among her style influences in an interview for &quot;Fashionista.&quot;

British fashion designer John Galliano chose Hill as his muse for the 2000 Spring/Summer Dior collection, he designed; The Hill-inspired collection featured models wearing dreadlocks and hoop earrings, and introduced the Dior &#x27;Saddle Bag&#x27;, which was made famous by the character Carrie Bradshaw in the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;; and according to &quot;Who What Wear&quot;, it is one of the ten most popular designer handbags ever. In 2017, the hip hop-based collection designed by Alexander Wang, as well as Tory Burch&#x27;s resort collection, were both inspired by Hill.

The Men&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2021 Louis Vuitton collection designed by Virgil Abloh, drew influence from Hill, with Abloh mentioning Hill as his &quot;forever muse&quot;. Hill later performed at Abloh&#x27;s memorial service after he died from a rare form of cancer in December 2021. She was also named among Daniel Roseberry&#x27;s influences for the Spring/Summer 2022 Schiaparelli collection. Designers Esteban Cortazar, Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss, and Humberto Leon of Kenzo, and Demna Gvasalia of Balenciaga, have also noted her as an inspiration.

=== Philanthropy ===
In the late 1990s, Hill presided over the Refugee Project, a nonprofit organization that served youth in New Jersey. The organization offered New Jersey youth scholarships, mentoring, after-school programs, a reading club and a summer camp program. The Refugee Project&#x27;s board of directors included Mariah Carey, Spike Lee, actor Malcolm Jamal Warner, and rappers Busta Rhymes, Q-Tip, and Nas.

In 1999, she collaborated with the Federal government of the United States for an anti-drug campaign. On July 11, 2000, a hearing evaluating the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign was held at Congress. During the hearing, it was announced that Hill&#x27;s ad from the campaign was the most popular amongst a group of polled youth, with nearly 95 percent stating that they were affected by the ad. That same year, Hill participated in UNCF&#x27;s &#x27;Evening of Stars&#x27; telethon fundraiser, which raised $13.5 million.

In 2003, Hill was scheduled to perform at a Christmas benefit concert at the Vatican, located in a 7,500-seat concert hall customarily used by the Pope for his weekly general audiences. During the concert, Hill spoke out against sexual abuse of children by priests, stating &quot;God has been a witness to the corruption of his leadership, to the exploitation and abuses. It is the least one can say about the clergy.&quot; Hill added &quot;I realize some of you may be offended by what I&#x27;m saying, but what do you say to the families who were betrayed by the people in whom they believed?&quot;. The Pope was not in attendance; however, concert attendees included Cardinal Camillo Ruini, the pope&#x27;s vicar for Rome and the head of Italian bishops conference, his deputy, Monsignor Rino Fisichella, and Edmund Szoka. The comments sparked controversy at the time, and were edited out of the broadcast, which was set to air on Mediaset&#x27;s flagship Canale 5 station. In retrospect, many critics have applauded Hill for speaking out.

Hill later performed during the 2005 Live 8 benefit concert, to help raise awareness on global poverty.

She published the song &quot;Black Rage&quot; to SoundCloud in protest of the 2014 killing of Michael Brown. That same year, she performed at the Amnesty International &#x27;Bringing Human Rights Home&#x27; benefit concert in New York, in support of Pussy Riot; where she gave a rendition of her protest song &quot;Black Rage&quot;.

In 2015, she canceled a show in Israel after she was faced with a social media campaign by activists who urged her to boycott Israel over its occupation of Palestinian land. She later clarified that she does not take sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but &quot;believes in dignity for all sides&quot;, according to professor Noura Erakat.

Hill released an updated version of her 2002 track &quot;I Find It Hard to Say (Rebel)&quot; from her &quot;MTV Unplugged No. 2.0&quot; album entitled &quot;Rebel&quot; in 2016. The 2002 song was originally written about the Killing of Amadou Diallo, and was updated due to the influx of Police brutality in the United States at the time. The updated song was released exclusively on Tidal, and was performed at the Tidal X 1015 charity concert hosted by Jay-Z.

&quot;Variety&quot; reported that Hill declined an offer by the National Football League to join pop rock band Maroon 5 during their Super Bowl LIII halftime show, in solidarity with American football player Colin Kaepernick, after he received backlash for taking the knee.

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, Hill provided 10 scholarships for the 2019–2020 academic year to students at Alpha Institute in Kingston, Jamaica, through her MLH Fund.

==Legacy and impact==
Hill is widely considered to be one of the greatest rappers of all time and has often been called the greatest female rapper. &quot;The New York Times&quot; once referred to Hill as &quot;the most popular woman in hip-hop&quot;. Rapper Kool Moe Dee gave Hill the highest score of any rapper on his rap &#x27;Report Cards&#x27; list from the book, &quot;Ego Trip&#x27;s Book of Rap Lists.&quot; Furthermore, Beyoncé once stated that she is &quot;one of the best hip-hop rappers ever&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Time&quot; declared her as the &quot;Queen of Hip Hop&quot;; while Academy of Achievement, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and &quot;Billboard&quot;, among others, have also crowned her with the same title. In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Hill as the seventh greatest rapper of all time on their &quot;10 Best Rappers of All Time&quot; list, with her being the only woman on the list. 

Music critic Brandon Tensley argued that &quot;few artists have marked culture as profoundly as Hill did with her solo debut&quot;. In 2012, &quot;VH1&quot; ranked Hill as one of the Greatest Woman in Music. In 2014, she was named the most influential woman in hip hop history by &quot;AllHipHop&quot;. Hill was also included on the &quot;NPR&quot; list of the &#x27;50 Great Voices&#x27;; and on the &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. In 2019, Hill ranked No. 1 on the &quot;Ranker&quot; poll of the greatest singer/rappers. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Hill at number 136 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. American Journalist Touré stated that &quot;She was—she is—the greatest female MC of all time&quot;.

In the peak of her career, Hill had earned over $25 million for her work. She is one of the best-selling female rappers of all time, with an estimated 50 million records sold worldwide, throughout the course of her career.

=== Musical impact ===
With her solo music and work with Fugees, Hill is often credited as the artist who popularized the technique of blending rap and melodic singing together into one single song, sometimes referred to as melodic rap; this has since become popular, with many modern artists like Beyoncé, Drake, Nicki Minaj and Kanye West emulating it. Writing for &quot;The Ringer&quot;, author Musa Okwonga wrote &quot;Decades before the ubiquity of the MC who could also croon, she could channel the greatness of Nina Simone and Rakim in the same set.&quot; In Complex, Andy Gee commented that &quot;the modern music landscape is dominated by artists like Drake and Nicki Minaj, who fall in the Lauryn Hill archetype as traditionalist-appeasing MCs who have records where they&#x27;re singing their hearts out.&quot; &quot;XXL&quot; argued that &quot;she set the bar high, not just for woman creators, but for anyone who wanted to rap or sing.&quot;

Former RIAA president Hilary Rosen, recognized Hill as a leading contributor to the blurring of lines that distinguished hip hop and R&amp;B. Minaj alluded to Hill&#x27;s impact on melodic rap on the song &quot;Can Anybody Hear Me&quot;, where she mentions that prior to fame, Def Jam Recordings wouldn&#x27;t sign her because she wanted to integrate rapping and singing on her album, but the record label told her she &quot;wasn&#x27;t Lauryn Hill&quot;. Lizzo who started her career as a rapper, later incorporated singing into her debut record. She stated in an interview in 2018, &quot;I was always afraid of being a singer, but then when I heard Lauryn Hill, I was like, maybe I can do both&quot;, further adding that her debut album drew influence from &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, &quot;rapping, singing, being political&quot;. According to Da Brat, Hill&#x27;s &quot;sound shifted the whole game&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Billboard&quot; considered Hill&#x27;s success to be a breakthrough for female rappers, which resulted in a brief increase of female rappers in the music industry at the time, that the publication dubbed &#x27;The Lauryn Hill Effect&#x27;. Author Nelson George noted, &quot;the presence of women is increasing&quot;; while Missy Elliott also added that &quot;Latifah opened the door for doing TV, and she might have opened it for Brandy. Now, it&#x27;s open for everybody. This is just the beginning&quot;. That same year, a public survey was conducted by MTV, which directly impacted its programming. In the survey, she was ranked the most respected solo artist, and placed among the acts that participants thought best defined their generation; with former Viacom executive Todd Cunningham referring to Hill as a &quot;massive phenomenon&quot;. Music journalist Danyel Smith credited Hill with reviving the hip hop genre, following the murders of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur.

=== Influence on other artists ===
Hill has often been cited as one of the most influential entertainers of her generation. In 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named her as one of the 200 most influential artists since 1996. Many artists have named Lauryn Hill as an inspiration to their careers, including pop artists Adele, Beyoncé, Dua Lipa, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Mumford &amp; Sons, Doja Cat, H.E.R., P!nk, Kelly Clarkson, Babyface, Summer Walker, rappers Kanye West, Jay-Z, Missy Elliott, Nicki Minaj, Nas, Lil&#x27; Kim, Brent Faiyaz, Rapsody; Lizzo, Doechii, Afrobeats singers Tems, and Wizkid; and K-pop artists Jennie of Blackpink, CL of 2NE1, and RM of BTS.

Nicki Minaj has made mention of Hill&#x27;s influence on her on multiple occasions; Including on 2020 U.S. number one single &quot;Say So Remix&quot;, In which Minaj raps, &quot;Spittin&#x27; like Weezy, Foxy, plus Lauryn&quot;. Minaj has also referred to Hill as her idol and quoted the artist in her high school yearbook. John Legend attributes his early career success and his launch into the music industry to Hill, who gave him his first major opportunity as a pianist on the song &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot;. Rapsody and Bebe Rexha have both cited Hill as their biggest musical inspiration, as well as UK grime rapper Stormzy naming her his biggest female musical influence.

Furthermore, musicians Erykah Badu and Jazmine Sullivan have both mentioned her as their musical hero. In addition Kehlani has a tattoo of Hill on her arm. After performing with Hill, The Weeknd described the experience as the &quot;most important experience of my life&quot;. During her 2018 Grammy award acceptance speech, Spanish singer Rosalía thanked her for being influential to her.

==== Music sampling ====
&quot;Billboard&quot; stated that Hill &quot;is to hip-hop as a gardener is to soil&quot;, and added that &quot;the rapper/singer planted classic gems in her catalog — especially her pristine 1998 debut &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; — that have become samples for many rap game MVPs&quot;.

Her single &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;, was sampled by Drake (on the song &quot;Draft Day&quot;), Kanye West (on &quot;Believe What I Say&quot;), and interpolated by Lizzo (on the song &quot;Break up Twice&quot; from her album &quot;Special&quot;). In 2018, Hill became one of the most sampled artists of the year, when her single &quot;Ex-Factor&quot; was sampled on Cardi B&#x27;s &quot;Be Careful&quot; and Drake&#x27;s &quot;Nice for What&quot;, while A$AP Rocky and Frank Ocean released &quot;Purity&quot; which sampled &quot;I Gotta Find Peace of Mind&quot;. J. Cole&#x27;s songs &quot;Cole Summer&quot; and &quot;Can I Holla at Ya&quot; from his EP &quot;Truly Yours&quot;, both contain samples of songs from &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;.

Hill&#x27;s vocals from her work with the Fugees has been sampled or interpolated by countless artists, including DJ Khaled and Nas, Busta Rhymes, the Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill, Jay-Z, and Mariah Carey (on the single &quot;Save the Day&quot;, from her compilation album &quot;The Rarities&quot;). Furthermore, multiple artists have sampled Hill&#x27;s songs from her live album &quot;MTV Unplugged No. 2.0&quot; including Frank Ocean (on the Jazmine Sullivan-featured &quot;Rushes&quot; from his 2016 album &quot;Endless&quot;), Method Man (&quot;Say&quot;), and most notably Kanye West (&quot;All Falls Down&quot; featuring Syleena Johnson).

=== Film and stage ===
As an actress, Hill&#x27;s most memorable role was portraying Rita Watson in the 1993 film &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot;. Hill&#x27;s performance in the film inspired Janelle Monáe to pursue an acting career. Multiple publications have listed her performance in the film as one of the best acting performances by a rapper.

The 2015 Broadway musical &quot;Hamilton&quot; was heavily influenced by Hill, with creator Lin-Manuel Miranda naming Hill as one of his favorite rappers. Miranda also referenced the track &quot;Lost Ones&quot; during the song &quot;We Know&quot;, and Hill&#x27;s verse from the Fugees single &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, on the song &quot;Helpless&quot; from the musical.

====Lateness in concert====
Hill has earned a reputation for being late to her own concerts. She irritated Wyclef Jean during a short 2005 tour by failing to appear on stage with the rest of the Fugees until 45–50 minutes into the performance. At the 2007 Nice Jazz Festival, Hill was 90 minutes late for her set, and she sang too softly to be heard. She was 2.5 hours late for a Brooklyn show in August 2007: the free Martin Luther King Jr. Concert Series. In December 2010, she took the stage in Boston two-and-a-half hours late. She was two hours late in Atlanta in May 2016, performing for only 40 minutes because the venue had a strict 11 pm curfew; she explained she had been &quot;aligning my energy with the time&quot;.

In November 2023, she was widely criticized for being late to a show in Los Angeles. She responded by saying her fans should consider themselves &quot;lucky&quot; that she appears on stage &quot;every night&quot;. The comments were made a week after she said her doctors ordered her to vocal rest after she postponed a series of shows due to vocal injuries. According to Paul Meara of BET, Hill later shared an extended version of her comments that could be perceived as directed more toward the music industry than Hill&#x27;s fans.

==Achievements==
Hill has won numerous accolades throughout her career, including eight Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year), the most won by a female rapper. She has also received six MTV Video Music Awards (including Video of the Year), four NAACP Image Awards (including the President&#x27;s Award), four Guinness World Records, and three American Music Awards. In 2021, she was among the inaugural nominees for the Black Music and Entertainment Walk of Fame, and was inducted in 2022.

Hill won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album as a member of The Fugees, for their album &quot;The Score&quot;, becoming the first woman to win the award. &quot;The Score&quot; also peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Her first solo studio album, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, also peaked at number one, making Hill the first solo female hip hop act to reach number one on that chart. The album sold more than 422,000 copies in its first week, which had broken the record previously held by Madonna, for highest first-week sales by a female artist. Both &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; and its lead single &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; debuted at number one in the U.S., making Hill the first act to have debuted at number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Hot 100 with their first entries on each chart. The album also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it the first album by a female artist to accomplish this feat.

At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, Hill received ten Grammy Award nominations and won five that night, including Album of the Year, with &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; being the first Hip hop album to win the award. She also set the record for most nominations for a female artist in one night, broke the record at the time previously set by Carole King for the most wins by a female artist in one night, and became the first female rapper to win the Best New Artist award. Furthermore, she also became the first black solo act to win MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.

In 1999, following the success of her first solo album, Hill landed on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, being the only black musician to land on the cover during that decade. With &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, she became a pioneer in the neo soul movement, when the album was one of the first in the genre to achieve mainstream success, and became the best-selling neo soul album of all time. The album has also been inducted into the Library of Congress. &quot;NPR&quot; ranked it 2nd on its list of &quot;The 150 Greatest Albums Made by Women&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it as the 10th-Greatest Album of All Time, on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, in 2020.

In 2021, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making Hill the first female hip hop artist to ever receive a Diamond certification in the United States. That same year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed her single &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; and the Fugees version of &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; on their revised list of the 500 Greatest Songs. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture included &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; on their &quot;Anthology of Hip-Hop and Rap&quot; box set. In 2024, The Recording Academy selected it to be inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. It was also featured as the number one album of Apple Music&#x27;s 2024 list of the 100 best albums.

Along with having a successful music career as a member of The Fugees and as a solo artist, Hill also achieved success as a songwriter and producer for other artists. Hill has written songs for Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige, CeCe Winans and produced songs for Whitney Houston and Santana, among others. In 2015, she received the Golden Note Award from American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Hill has also won ASCAP songwriting awards for her credits on Drake&#x27;s &quot;Nice for What&quot;, Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;A Rose Is Still a Rose&quot;, Cardi B&#x27;s &quot;Be Careful&quot;, Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;All That I Can Say&quot;, and Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;All Falls Down&quot;.

<text>Scandinavian Airlines, stylized as SAS, is the national airline of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Short for Scandinavian Airlines System and legally referred to as Scandinavian Airlines System Denmark-Norway-Sweden, SAS is part of SAS Group and is headquartered in Solna, Sweden.

Including its subsidiaries SAS Link and SAS Connect, the airline operates a fleet of 133 aircraft to 130 destinations, as of July 2024. The principal hub of SAS is Copenhagen Airport, which connects to 106 destinations worldwide. The airline&#x27;s two other hubs Stockholm Arlanda Airport with 74 destinations, and Oslo Airport, with 56 destinations. Additionally, there are minor hubs at Bergen Airport, Flesland, Göteborg Landvetter Airport, Stavanger Airport, and Trondheim Airport.

In 2017, SAS carried 28.6 million passengers, achieving revenues of 40 billion Swedish kronor. This made it the eighth-largest airline in Europe and the largest in Denmark and Sweden. The SAS fleet is composed of aircraft consisting of Airbus A319, Airbus A320, Airbus A320neo, Airbus A321LR, Airbus A330, Airbus A350 and Embraer 195 aircraft. SAS also wet leases Airbus A320neo, ATR 72, and Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft.

The airline was founded in 1946 as a consortium to pool the transatlantic operations of Swedish airline Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik, Norway&#x27;s Det Norske Luftfartselskap and Det Danske Luftfartselskab of Denmark. The consortium was extended to cover European and domestic cooperation two years later. In 1951, all the airlines were merged to create SAS. SAS has been described as &quot;an icon of Norwegian–Swedish–Danish cooperation&quot;. In 1997, SAS co-founded Star Alliance, the first of the three major airline alliances, alongside United Airlines, Air Canada, Lufthansa and Thai Airways International. On 27 June 2018, the Norwegian government announced that it had sold all its shares in SAS.

In October 2023, as part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Scandinavian Airlines&#x27; parent company SAS Group, Air France–KLM, the Government of Denmark and two financial firms announced plans to invest in SAS Group, with Air France–KLM taking a 19.9% stake. On March 19, 2024, US Bankruptcy Court approved the investment and European Commission announced that it approved the investment on June 28, 2024. Then as a result of the new ownership, SAS left Star Alliance on 31 August 2024, and joined in the same alliance of AF-KLM, SkyTeam, the following day.
==History==
=== Founding ===

The airline was founded on 1 August 1946, when Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik AB (an airline owned by the Swedish Wallenberg family), Det Danske Luftfartselskab A/S, and Det Norske Luftfartselskap AS (the flag carriers of Denmark and Norway) formed a partnership to handle the combined air traffic of the three Scandinavian countries. The first president of SAS was Per Norlin. On 17 September 1946, operations started under the new entity and the first international service was conducted between Stockholm and New York. Within a half-year, SAS set a new record for carrying the heaviest single piece of air cargo across the Atlantic on a scheduled passenger airliner, by shipping a 1,400-pound electrical panel from New York to the Sandvik company in Sweden.

In 1948, the Swedish flag carrier AB Aerotransport joined SAS and quickly coordinated its European operations between both carriers. Three years later, the companies formally merged to form the SAS Consortium. When established, ownership of the airline was divided between SAS Danmark (28.6%), SAS Norge (28.6%), and SAS Sverige (42.8%), all of which were owned 50% by private investors and 50% by their governments.

=== Transpolar route ===
During 1954, SAS became the first airline to commence scheduled flights on a polar route, flying Douglas DC-6Bs from Copenhagen to Los Angeles with stops in Søndre Strømfjord (now Kangerlussuaq) in Greenland and Winnipeg in Canada, pioneering a commercial route that marked a milestone in transpolar aviation history. By the summer of 1956, traffic on the route had justified the frequency to be increased to three flights per week. The service proved relatively popular with Hollywood celebrities and members of the film industry, and the route turned out to be a publicity coup for SAS. Thanks to a tariff structure that allowed free transit to other European destinations via Copenhagen, this trans-polar route gained increasing popularity with American tourists throughout the 1950s.

In 1957, SAS was the first airline to offer around-the-world service over the North Pole via a second polar route served by Douglas DC-7Cs flying from Copenhagen to Tokyo via Anchorage International Airport in Alaska. The flight via Alaska was a compromise solution since the Soviet Union would not allow SAS, among other air carriers, to fly across Siberia between Europe and Japan, and Chinese airspace was also closed.

=== Jet era ===
In 1959, SAS entered the jet age, having procured a number of French-built Sud Aviation Caravelles as the company&#x27;s first jetliner. During the following year, another jetliner, the Douglas DC-8, was also inducted into the fleet.

In addition to modern airliners, SAS also adopted innovative operating practices and systems to improve the customer experience. In 1965, it was the first airline to introduce an electronic reservation system. During 1971, SAS introduced its first Boeing 747 jumbo jet into service. Prior to the delivery of its first 747s, SAS had formed the KSS maintenance consortium with KLM and Swissair in 1969 to provide a maintenance pool and standardize aircraft specifications for the three airlines&#x27; 747 fleets. The consortium later incorporated UTA and was renamed into KSSU to jointly acquire and maintain McDonnell Douglas DC-10 widebody trijets. In 1982, SAS was recognised as the most punctual airline operating in Europe at that time.

During its first decades, the airline built two large hotels in central Copenhagen, &quot;SAS Royal Hotel&quot; (5 stars) and the even larger &quot;SAS Hotel Scandinavia&quot; (4 stars, with a casino on the 26th floor). In 1980, SAS opened its first hotel outside of Scandinavia, the &quot;SAS Kuwait Hotel&quot;. By 1989, SAS&#x27;s hotel division owned a 40 percent share in the Intercontinental Hotels Group. Following the deregulation of commercial aviation in Europe and the competitive pressures from new rivals, SAS experienced economic difficulties (as did many incumbent flag carrier airlines) this heavily contributed to the airline&#x27;s decision to sell its hotel chain to the Radisson Hotel Group during 1992.


=== Consolidation, acquisitions, and partnerships===
In 1981, Jan Carlzon was appointed as the CEO of SAS; during his tenure, the company underwent a successful financial turnaround of the company starting in 1981 and who envisioned SAS ownership of multiple airlines worldwide. SAS gradually acquired control of the domestic markets in all three countries; this was achieved by acquiring full or partial control of various competing local airlines, including Braathens and Widerøe in Norway; Linjeflyg and Skyways Express in Sweden; and Cimber Air in Denmark. During 1989, SAS acquired 18.4% of the Texas Air Corporation, the parent company of Continental Airlines, in a bid to form a global alliance. However, this did not come about and the stake in the Texas Air Corporation was subsequently sold on. During the 1990s, SAS also acquired a 20 percent stake in British Midland, as well as purchasing 95 percent of Spanair, the second-largest airline in Spain, in addition to Air Greenland.

During the early 1990s, SAS unsuccessfully tried to merge itself with KLM, along with Austrian Airlines and Swissair, in a proposed combined entity commonly called Alcazar. However, months of negotiations towards this ambitious merger ultimately collapsed due to multiple unsettled issues; this strategic failure heavily contributed to the departure of Carlzon that same year and his replacement by Jan Reinås. The airline marked its 50th year of operation on 1 August 1996 with the harmonization and name of SAS&#x27;s parent company to &quot;SAS Danmark A/S, SAS Norge ASA&quot; and &quot;SAS Sverige AB&quot;. During May 1997, SAS became a founding member of the global Star Alliance network, joining with airlines such as Air Canada, Lufthansa, Thai Airways International, and United Airlines.

In June 2001, the ownership structure of SAS was changed, with a holding company being created in which the holdings of the governments changed to Sweden (21.4%), Norway (14.3%), and Denmark (14.3%), while the remaining 50 percent of shares were publicly held and traded on the stock market. During 2004, SAS was again restructured, being divided into four separate companies: &quot;SAS Scandinavian Airlines Sverige AB, SAS Scandinavian Airlines Danmark A/S, SAS Braathens AS,&quot; and &quot;SAS Scandinavian International AS&quot;. &quot;SAS Braathens&quot; was re-branded &quot;SAS Scandinavian Airlines Norge AS&quot; in 2007. However, during October 2009, the four companies were once again united into one company, named &quot;SAS Scandinavian System AB&quot;.

=== 2009-2021: Restructuring ===
With the growth of budget airlines and decreasing fares in Scandinavia, the business experienced financial hardship. By 2009, competitive pressures had compelled the airline to launch a cost-cutting initiative. In the first step of which, the business sold its stakes in other companies, such as British Midland International, Spanair, and airBaltic, and began to restructure its operations. During January 2009, an agreement to divest more than 80 percent of the holdings in Spanair was signed with a Catalan group of investors led by Consorci de Turisme de Barcelona and Catalana d&#x27;Inciatives. These changes reportedly reduced the airliner&#x27;s expenses by around 23 per cent between 2008 and 2011.

In November 2012, the company came under heavy pressure from its owners and banks to implement even heavier cost-cutting measures as a condition for continued financial support. Negotiations with the respective trade unions took place for more than a week and exceeded the original deadline; in the end, an agreement was reached between SAS and the trade unions that would increase the work time, cutting employee&#x27;s salaries by between 12 and 20 percent, along with reductions to the pension and retirement plans; these measures were aimed at keeping the airline as an operating concern. SAS criticized how it handled the negotiations, having reportedly denied facilities to the union delegations.

During 2017, SAS announced that it was forming a new airline, Scandinavian Airlines Ireland, operating out of Heathrow Airport and Málaga Airport to fly European routes on its parent&#x27;s behalf using nine Airbus A320neos. SAS sought to replace its own aircraft with cheaper ones crewed and based outside Scandinavia to compete better with other airlines. The Swedish Pilots Union expressed its dissatisfaction with the operational structure of the new airline, suggesting it violated the current labour-agreements. The Swedish Cabin Crew Union also condemned the new venture and stated that SAS established the airline to &quot;not pay decent salaries&quot; to cabin crew.

In 2018, SAS announced that it had placed an order for 50 Airbus A320neo narrow-body jetliners to facilitate the creation of a single-type fleet. That same year, the Norwegian government divested its stake in the airline. As part of an environmental initiative launched by San Francisco International Airport (SFO), SAS flights operating out of SFO since December 2018 have been supplied with sustainable aviation fuel from Shell and SkyNRG.

In July 2021, the European Commission approved a Swedish and Danish aid measure of approximately US$356 million to support SAS. In September 2021, SAS announced that it would establish two operating subsidiaries; SAS Connect and SAS Link, with its existing SAS Ireland subsidiary to be rebranded as the new SAS Connect, while SAS Link would initially operate the airline&#x27;s Embraer E195 aircraft, and the operations of both companies to begin by early 2022.

=== 2022-2024: Sweden&#x27;s exit, Air France-KLM entry and alliance shift ===
Following little progress with SAS&#x27;s restructuring plan, SAS Forward, the Swedish government announced on 7 June 2022 that Sweden, which owns 21.8% of the company, would not inject new capital into SAS and that it did &quot;not aim to be a long-term shareholder in the company&quot;. The airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States on 5 July 2022.

In September 2022, SAS announced it was returning at least ten aircraft to lessors, including five long-haul aircraft - amongst them two barely two year old Airbus A350s. This measure is a result of the closure of Russian airspace for flights to Asia which caused a severe drop in demand and efficiency. As of November 2022, SAS announced it was searching for a buyer for one of their Airbus A350 aircraft.

In October 2023, it was announced that the Air France–KLM Group would be investing alongside the Danish government and two investment firms in SAS, with the airline group buying up to 20% of SAS shares following the airline&#x27;s ongoing Chapter 11 process in the United States. With the investment (if approved by the EU Commission, and respective US and Swedish courts), SAS will leave Star Alliance and join SkyTeam alongside Air France–KLM.

On 19 March 2024, US Bankruptcy Court approved the new restructuring plan and investment, allowing SAS to exit Chapter 11 by mid-2024. It also applied for company reorganization in Sweden on 27 March. announced it would leave Star Alliance by 31 August 2024, becoming a SkyTeam member the next day, as confirmed on 29 April. On 12 June, Stockholm District Court announced that it will held a hearing for the company reorganization on 12 July, eventually approving it on 19 July. On 28 June, European Commission announced that it approved the restructuring plan.

In September 2024, Scandinavian Airlines announced it would terminate its wet-leasing contract with Xfly by November 2024. On 17 September 2024, SAS announced a partnership with Braathens Regional Airlines (BRA), designating them as a subcontractor to operate flights from Stockholm Arlanda Airport starting in 2025, with BRA announcing it would cease operating its own domestic flight network from Stockholm Bromma Airport. This collaboration, valued at approximately SEK 6 billion over seven years, aims to strengthen SAS&#x27;s domestic network in Sweden, increasing daily departures to destinations such as Visby, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå.

On 18 September 2024, just a month after the completion of the restructuring, SAS announced expansion of the route network from Copenhagen Airport with 15 new destinations from Summer 2025. Following the new ownership structure, the airline will focus on positioning the airport as the airline&#x27;s main hub for international travel.

==Corporate affairs==

===Business trends===
The key trends for Scandinavian Airlines Group (which includes SAS Cargo, SAS Ground Handling, and SAS Tech), are shown below (since 2012, for years ending 31 October):

===Head office===

Scandinavian Airlines&#x27; head office is located in the SAS Frösundavik Office Building in , Solna Municipality, Stockholm County. Between 2011 and 2013, the head office was located at Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN) in Sigtuna Municipality, Sweden. The SAS Cargo Group A/S head office is in Kastrup, Tårnby Municipality, Denmark.

The SAS Frösundavik Office Building, was designed by Niels Torp Architects and built between 1985 and 1987. The move from Solna to Arlanda was completed in 2010. A previous SAS head office was located on the grounds of Bromma Airport in Stockholm. In 2013 SAS announced that it once again would relocate to Frösundavik.

==Emissions==
Data for passengers, aircraft and profit from section Business Trends above.

In contrast to most other businesses and private individuals in Sweden, airlines are exempt from the Swedish carbon tax. Had SAS paid the Swedish carbon tax level of SEK1180 (EUR114) per tonne () for all of its emissions, it would have had significant impact on recent profit levels. Since 2012 airlines are included in the EU ETS. In January 2013 the price for extra emission rights on top of the granted were approximately EUR 6.3 per tonne. In May 2017 the price was EUR 4.9 per tonne.

, Scandinavian Airlines also has the following aircraft operated by its subsidiaries and other carriers under wetlease agreements:
===Future fleet plans===
====Short haul====

On 20 June 2011, SAS announced an order for 30 new A320neo aircraft as part of its fleet harmonization plan. SAS&#x27; stated goal is to have an all-Airbus fleet at its bases in Stockholm and Copenhagen by 2019, with a mixed A320neo and A320ceo fleet operation at both bases. The base in Oslo was then operate mostly Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with a few 737-700s also being retained at the time. The older, smaller 737-600s were disposed of in 2019. The first order of A320neos was delivered in October 2016.

In April 2018, SAS announced an order of 50 more A320neos to replace all 737NGs and older A320ceos in service as part of its goal to have an all-Airbus fleet by 2023. The last Boeing 737 has been phased from the fleet on 19 November 2023. This Boeing 737-700, registered LN-RRB and named &quot;Dag Viking&quot;, was operating as SAS Flight 737. As of now, the aircraft is currently operated by Canadian North as C-FHNH.

====Long haul====
On 25 June 2013, SAS and Airbus signed a Memorandum of Understanding stating that SAS intends to buy twelve new-generation aircraft, including six options. The agreement consists of eight A350-900s with six options and four A330-300Es. The first new long-haul aircraft to enter service will be the A330-300E, which was originally planned to replace the aging A340-300s in 2015 as leasing agreements on these aircraft expire. Instead, SAS renewed the leasing agreements to be able to expand its long-haul fleet and used the new A330-300Es to add more long-haul destinations to its network.

The first 6 of 8 Airbus A350-900s for SAS were delivered to the airline in 2019 and were to be operating long-haul routes from 2020. The A350 will first fly on the Copenhagen and Chicago route, with the airline planning Beijing, New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and San Francisco when more A350 are delivered.

===Livery===
In September 2019, SAS unveiled an all-new livery, which will initially be showcased on a new A350 and an A320neo, before gradually being rolled out to the whole fleet. SAS expects the whole fleet to be repainted by 2024. The fuselage is kept in a light beige with the &quot;SAS&quot; logotype in silver displayed prominently across the height of the front section. The vertical stabilizer and adjacent parts of the fuselage are blue, with the SAS logo in white shown on the stabilizer. The blue area on the rear fuselage extends towards the front in a curved line. The horizontal stabilizers are beige (except for the ATR-72 aircraft, where they are blue). Winglets are blue as well. The engine casings are beige with a vertical blue stripe at the front and bear the word &quot;Scandinavian&quot; in blue. &quot;Scandinavian&quot; in large blue letters is also displayed on the underbelly of the aircraft.

The previous livery was introduced in 1998 and was designed by SthlmLab (Stockholm Design Lab). SAS aircraft look predominantly white; however, the fuselage is in a very light beige (Pantone Warm Gray 2/Pantone 9083C) with &quot;Scandinavian&quot; above the windows in silver lettering (Pantone 877) and &quot;Airlines&quot; below the windows in white. The typeface used is Rotis Semi Serif. The vertical stabilizer (and winglets) are painted blue (Pantone 2738C) with the classic white SAS logo on it. It is a variant of the traditional SAS logotype, slimmed slightly and stylized by the design company Stockholm Design Lab as part of the SAS livery change. The engine casing is painted in scarlet (Pantone Warm Red/Pantone 179C) with the word Scandinavian in white, the thrust reversers in the color of the fuselage. All other text is painted in Pantone Warm Gray 9. The design also features stylized versions of the Scandinavian flags. All aircraft are named, traditionally after Vikings.

Apart from the standard livery, SAS also operates an Airbus A319-100 in retro livery.

==Cabin==
===SAS Business===
On long-haul flights business class, called &quot;SAS Business&quot;, is offered and features wide sleeper seats. On the A330s and A350s seating is 1-2-1 on seats that convert into flat beds, with power sockets and a entertainment screen. On the A321LRs business class has alternating 2-2 and 1-1 seating, all convertible to flat beds.

===SAS Plus===
Plus is SAS&#x27; premium economy class. On the A330s seating is 2-3-2, 2-4-2 on the A350s and on the A321LR it is 2-2. The seats offered on SAS Plus are wider than those in the SAS Go section.

On European flights, SAS Plus tickets are refundable and include a meal, a double checked-in baggage allowance, and access to lounges and fast track security at the airport. The SAS Plus passengers are seated at the front of the aircraft and passengers can choose their seat at booking for free, but the seats there are otherwise the same as the SAS Go seats. The two-class system was introduced in June 2013, when business class was eliminated from intra-European flights.

===SAS Go===
SAS Go, or economy, offers 3-3 seating on intracontinental flights, 2-4-2 on the A330s and 3-3-3 on the A350s.

SAS offers free coffee and tea to GO passengers on short-haul services, except very short flights like Bergen-Stavanger or Stockholm-Visby. Meals are served to all passengers on long-haul flights.

===SAS Go Light===
SAS Go Light is a variant of SAS Go with no checked luggage included. Tickets are sold in the same booking class as SAS Go and are otherwise identical. As of 14 December 2017, SAS Go Light is available on both European and long-haul flights. SAS Go Light is aimed at competing with low-cost carriers for those who travel with hand luggage only. Extra luggage allowance for Star Alliance Gold, and EuroBonus Silver, Gold, and Diamond members does not apply on SAS Go Light tickets and is only valid for EuroBonus Pandion members.

==Services==
===EuroBonus===

SAS&#x27;s frequent-flyer program is called EuroBonus. Members earn points on all SAS flights, Widerøe routes with no SAS competition (except Public Service Operations) as well as on Star Alliance flights. Around 50 percent of SAS&#x27; total revenues are generated by EuroBonus members. By August 2015, the EuroBonus program had in excess of four million members.

===Wi‑Fi===
During May 2018, SAS launched a new high-speed Wi‑Fi Internet access system supplied by Viasat. The new system was announced to enable passengers to stream movies on board. Prior to this, SAS offered Internet access on board on its long haul aircraft and a small number of Boeing 737s. Wi‑Fi Internet access is free for Eurobonus Gold and Diamond members and those with Business class ticket. Otherwise, it can be purchased with EuroBonus points or for a fee.

==Accidents and incidents==
=== Non-aviation related incidents ===

==== Controversial advertising campaign ====
On 10 February 2020, SAS released 2 minutes and 45 seconds long commercial on YouTube titled &quot;What is truly Scandinavian?&quot; which tells a story about company&#x27;s values and highlighting the ideas and inventions that globalism brought to Scandinavia, which caused an outrage among right-wing groups due to its perceived denigration of Scandinavian culture. On 12 February 2020, SAS Group, a parent company of SAS, released a statement that they would continue with the advertising campaign despite the outrage.

On 13 February 2020, 3 days after commercial was published, SAS offices in Adelgade, Copenhagen and advertising agency &amp;Co which produced the commercial received bomb threats. Later, a shorter 45 second version of the same commercial was republished on Facebook by SAS and official version on YouTube made private.

==== Responses ====
Norwegian Air quickly reacted to the controversy by publishing the message &quot;Fortunately, nobody can take away the cheese slicer from us&quot; () and an image on Facebook of a cheese slicer, which Norwegians claim to have invented.
