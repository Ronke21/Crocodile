<text>Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z, is an American rapper, businessman, and record executive. Rooted in East Coast hip-hop, he was named the greatest rapper of all time by &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Vibe&quot; in 2023. Known for his complex lyrical ability—which often uses double entendres and word play—and braggadocio, his music is built upon a rags to riches narrative. He served as president and chief executive officer of Def Jam Recordings from 2004 to 2007, and founded the entertainment company Roc Nation the following year.

A protégé of fellow New York City-based rapper Jaz-O, Jay-Z began his musical career in the late 1980s; he co-founded the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1994 to release his first two studio albums &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1996) and &quot;In My Lifetime, Vol. 1&quot; (1997), both of which were met with critical acclaim. Each of his eleven subsequent albums, including &quot;The Blueprint&quot; (2001), &quot;The Black Album&quot; (2003), &quot;American Gangster&quot; (2007), and &quot;4:44&quot; (2017), debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; Jay-Z holds the joint-record for the most number-one albums (14) of any solo artist on the chart (tied with Drake and Taylor Swift). He has also released the collaborative albums &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; (2002) and &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; (2004) with singer R. Kelly, &quot;Collision Course&quot; (2004) with Linkin Park, &quot;Watch the Throne&quot; (2011) with Kanye West, and &quot;Everything Is Love&quot; (2018) with his wife Beyoncé. He peaked the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on four occasions: once as a lead artist with his 2009 single &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot; (featuring Alicia Keys), and thrice with his guest performances on the singles &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; by Mariah Carey, &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; by Beyoncé, and &quot;Umbrella&quot; by Rihanna.

Through his business ventures, Jay-Z became the first hip-hop billionaire in 2019. In 1999, he co-founded the clothing retailer Rocawear and later founded the 40/40 Club, a luxury bar chain, in 2003. As both grew into multi-million-dollar businesses, he launched Roc Nation, a multi-disciplinary entertainment agency in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the technology company Aspiro and led the expansion of Tidal, the company&#x27;s media streaming service. As of 2025, he is the wealthiest musical artist in the world with a net worth of US$2.5 billion.

One of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists with 140 million records sold, Jay-Z has won 25 Grammy Awards, the tenth-most of all time and the most awarded for any hip hop artist. He is the recipient of the NAACP&#x27;s President&#x27;s Award and three Emmy Awards (including two Primetime Emmy Awards), in addition to being nominated for a Tony Award. Ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, Jay-Z was the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the first solo living rapper inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. &quot;Time&quot; named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Shawn Corey Carter was born on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York City. He was raised in Marcy Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn&#x27;s Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood. His father, Adnis Reeves, abandoned the family when Jay-Z was 11 years old, and Jay-Z and his three older siblings were raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves later met and reconciled with Jay-Z prior to his death in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics to &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;, the closing track on his 1997 album &quot;In My Lifetime, Vol. 1&quot;, that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother Eric in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry.

He attended Eli Whitney High School and George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, both in Brooklyn, and then Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey. He did not graduate, dropping out during his sophomore year at Trenton Central High School. According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine and was shot at three times during this period. His former friend was sentenced to prison for possessing drugs and weapons. Known as &quot;Jazzy&quot; around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name &quot;Jay-Z&quot; in homage to his mentor Jaz-O.

==Career==
Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O&#x27;s early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including &quot;H. P. Gets Busy&quot;, &quot;The Originators&quot; and &quot;Hawaiian Sophie&quot;. Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s. He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut &quot;Show and Prove&quot; on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home.&quot; Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane&#x27;s hype man during this period, although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. &quot;When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.&quot;

According to his second verse on &quot;99 Problems&quot;, released in 2003, Jay-Z was allegedly stopped by an NYPD detective in 1994 while en route to I-95, possibly for a search of drugs in his car. Detection dogs were called, but another police car had passed; Jay-Z was let go soon after. Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, &quot;Da Graveyard&quot;, and on Mic Geronimo&#x27;s &quot;Time to Build&quot;, which also featured early appearances by his former Murder Inc. colleagues Ja Rule and DMX in 1995. His first official rap single was &quot;In My Lifetime&quot;, which was released with an accompanying music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get with That&quot;.

===1995–2000: &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, &quot;In My Lifetime, Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Vol. 2...&quot;, &quot;Vol. 3...&quot;, and &quot;The Dynasty&quot;===
With no major label to give him a record deal, Jay-Z sold burned CDs out of his car, and with Damon &quot;Dame&quot; Dash and Kareem &quot;Biggs&quot; Burke, created Roc-A-Fella Records as an independent label in 1995. After striking a distribution deal with Priority, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Super DJ Clark Kent and an appearance by The Notorious B.I.G. The album reached number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was generally favored by critics. This album would later be included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as No. 248 and eventually reach platinum status. After reaching a new label distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up &quot;In My Lifetime, Vol. 1.&quot; Featuring production by Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs, DJ Premier, and Ski, it earned platinum status in the United States.

In 1998, Jay-Z released &quot;Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life&quot; which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, &quot;Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)&quot;. He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz, an upstart in-house producer for Ruff Ryders, and Timbaland. Other producers included DJ Premier, Erick Sermon, The 45 King, and Kid Capri. Charting hits from this album included &quot;Can I Get A...&quot;, featuring Ja Rule and Amil, and &quot;Nigga What, Nigga Who&quot;, featuring Amil and Jaz-O. &quot;Vol. 2&quot; would eventually become Jay-Z&#x27;s most commercially successful album; it was certified 5× Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies. The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX&#x27;s failure to garner a Grammy nomination and the academy&#x27;s decision to not broadcast urban music categories. 
In 1999, Jay-Z collaborated with Mariah Carey on &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, a song from her seventh album, &quot;Rainbow&quot;. The song became Jay-Z&#x27;s first chart-topper in the U.S., spending two weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In that same year, Jay-Z released &quot;Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter&quot;. The album proved successful and sold over 3 million copies. &quot;Vol. 3&quot;″s most successful single was &quot;Big Pimpin&quot;, featuring UGK.

In 2000, Jay-Z released &quot;The Dynasty: Roc La Familia&quot;, which was originally intended to become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists but Def Jam turned into a Jay-Z album. The album helped to introduce newcomer producers The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Bink, which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. &quot;The Dynasty&quot; sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.

===2001–2002: Feud with Nas, &quot;The Blueprint&quot; and &quot;The Blueprint2&quot;===
In 2001, Jay-Z spoke out against Prodigy after he took an issue with a Jay-Z line from &quot;Money, Cash, Hoes&quot; that he felt alluded disparagingly to Mobb Deep and Prodigy&#x27;s dispute with Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, and Death Row Records. He later performed the song &quot;Takeover&quot;, at Summer Jam 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson. A line at the end of &quot;Takeover&quot; referred to Nas, who criticized him on &quot;We Will Survive&quot;. Nas responded with a diss of his own, and Jay-Z straightaway added a verse to &quot;Takeover&quot; which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers. The feud had ended by 2005; Jay-Z stated that record producer Mark Pitts had helped them settle their differences.

On September 11, 2001, Jay-Z released his sixth studio album, &quot;The Blueprint&quot;, which received a five-mic review from hip-hop magazine &quot;The Source.&quot; Written in just two days, the album sold more than 427,000 copies, debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Eminem guest performed and produced its song, &quot;Renegade&quot;. Four tracks were produced by Kanye West. &quot;The Blueprint&quot; includes the songs &quot;Izzo (H.O.V.A.)&quot;, &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot;, &quot;Jigga That Nigga&quot;, and &quot;Song Cry&quot;. , the album had sold 2.7 million copies worldwide. In 2019, &quot;The Blueprint&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In October 2001, Jay-Z pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for stabbing record producer Lance Rivera at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City in 1999. Despite Jay-Z&#x27;s sentence of three years probation for the crime, Rivera later recanted the allegations in 2023.

Jay-Z then collaborated with Chicago singer R. Kelly to release collaborative studio album, &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; in March 2002. In November of that year, Jay-Z released his seventh studio album &quot;The Blueprint2: The Gift &amp; The Curse&quot;—a double album. The album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units solely in the U.S. and surpassing &quot;The Blueprint&quot;. It yielded a single-disc re-issue, &quot;The Blueprint 2.1&quot;, which retained half of the songs from the original. Its original release spawned two hit singles, &quot;Excuse Me Miss&quot; and &quot;&#x27;03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;, which features Jay-Z&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Beyoncé, and contained the track &quot;A Dream&quot;, featuring Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G.; the re-issue spawned the single &quot;La-La-La&quot;, which was a sequel to &quot;Excuse Me Miss&quot; and failed to match its commercial success.

===2003–2005: &quot;The Black Album&quot; and initial retirement===

After visiting the south of France, Jay-Z announced work on his eighth studio album, &quot;The Black Album&quot; at the opening of the 40/40 Club. He worked with several producers including Just Blaze, The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Eminem, DJ Quik, 9th Wonder, The Buchanans, and Rick Rubin. Notable songs on the album included &quot;What More Can I Say&quot;, &quot;Dirt off Your Shoulder&quot;, &quot;Change Clothes&quot;, and &quot;99 Problems&quot;. &quot;The Black Album&quot; has sold over 3 million copies in the U.S.

On November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert—billed as a &quot;retirement party&quot; at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which was later the focus of his 2004 documentary, &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators the Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly, with appearances by Voletta Wallace and Afeni Shakur, the mothers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, respectively. While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, as well as the release and tour of &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, the second collaborative album between Jay-Z and R. Kelly.

In 2004, Jay-Z collaborated with rock group Linkin Park, in which they released their collaborative remix EP &quot;Collision Course&quot;, which featured mashups of both artists&#x27; songs, as well as a concert DVD. The album&#x27;s only single, &quot;Numb/Encore&quot;, went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was performed with Linkin Park live at the Grammys, with a special appearance by Paul McCartney, who added verses from the song &quot;Yesterday&quot;. The EP sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. Jay-Z was the executive producer of &quot;The Rising Tied&quot;, the debut album of Fort Minor, the hip hop side project of Linkin Park rapper Mike Shinoda. Jay-Z also planned to retire in 2004.

Later in 2004, Jay-Z was named president of Def Jam Records, which led to Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies. Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake.

===2005–2007: &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; and &quot;American Gangster&quot;===

On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York&#x27;s Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the &quot;I Declare War&quot; concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously &quot;declared war&quot; on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals. The theme of the concert was Jay-Z&#x27;s position as president and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists, as well as Ne-Yo, Teairra Marí, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, The LOX, and Diddy.

At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans. The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; blended with Nas&#x27;s song &quot;The World is Yours&quot;.

Jay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006, titled &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. Jay-Z&#x27;s comeback single, &quot;Show Me What You Got&quot;, was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the FBI to step in and investigate. Jay-Z worked with video director Hype Williams, and the single&#x27;s video was directed by F. Gary Gray. The album features production from Just Blaze, Pharrell, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay&#x27;s Chris Martin (single entitled &quot;Beach Chair&quot;). The first week saw 680,000 sales of the CD, enough to be his &quot;biggest sales week ever&quot; as &quot;Billboard&quot; reported. This album has sold 2 million copies in the U.S.

Jay-Z released his tenth album entitled &quot;American Gangster&quot; on November 6, 2007. After viewing the Ridley Scott film of the same name, Jay-Z was heavily inspired to create a new &quot;concept&quot; album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler.
The album is not the film&#x27;s official soundtrack, although it was distributed by Def Jam.
Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;American Gangster&quot; depicts his life in correlation to the movie &quot;American Gangster&quot;. At the start of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Blue Magic&quot;, Jay-Z offers a dealer&#x27;s manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: &quot;Blame Reagan for making me to into a monster, blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra, I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin&#x27; stuff we was in concert.&quot; Also notable about the &quot;Blue Magic&quot; music video was Jay-Z flashing €500 notes; Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal called this a &quot;turning point in American pop culture&#x27;s response to globalization.&quot; The album has sold 1 million copies in the U.S. On January 1, 2008, Jay-Z resigned as president of Def Jam.

===2008–2011: &quot;The Blueprint 3&quot; and &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;===

In winter 2008, it was announced that Jay-Z would become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival. Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but Jay-Z?&quot; Gallagher asked, swearing. &quot;No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of, kind of, guitar music, do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night—you go, &#x27;Kylie Minogue? I don&#x27;t know about that&#x27;, do you know what I mean?—but I&#x27;m not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It&#x27;s wrong.&quot; As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, &quot;We don&#x27;t play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other&#x27;s genre of music and move forward.&quot; Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis&#x27;s iconic song &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.

He also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark, Hove Festival in Norway and O2 Wireless Festival in London. During Kanye West&#x27;s concert of August 6, 2008, at Madison Square Garden, Jay-Z came out to perform a new song and he and West proclaimed that it was to be on &quot;The Blueprint 3&quot;. On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z announced he would be parting ways with Def Jam, and had struck a multi-million-dollar deal to sign with Live Nation, with whom he would start his Roc Nation imprint which would serve as a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company and also partnered with production team Stargate to start a record label called StarRoc. Jay-Z&#x27;s 11th studio album &quot;The Blueprint 3&quot; was originally to be released on September 11, 2009, but was instead released in North America on September 8, 2009, due to increasing anticipation. Its international release followed on September 14. It is his 11th album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and has surpassed Elvis Presley&#x27;s previous record, making him the current solo-artist record holder. On October 9, 2009, Jay-Z kicked off his tour for &quot;The Blueprint 3&quot;, during which he supported his new album in North America. In a &quot;Shave Magazine&quot; review of his performance at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Jake Tomlinson expressed that &quot;It was the type of smooth performance you would expect from the hip-hop superstar.&quot; The review gave this performance 4 stars. His North American tour continued until November 22, 2009. At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA&#x27;s Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed &quot;Hard&quot; for the first time, then performed &quot;Run This Town&quot; with Jay-Z. Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produce the play &quot;Fela!&quot;, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti. Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti&#x27;s work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical. &quot;Fela!&quot; is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.

On January 23, 2010, Jay-Z released a track, &quot;Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)&quot;, with Rihanna, and U2&#x27;s Bono and The Edge, as well as performing it at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon. In June 2010, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in a pair of concerts in Detroit and New York. The event was dubbed The Home &amp; Home Tour. The first two concerts rapidly sold out, prompting the scheduling of an additional show at each venue. Jay-Z was the supporting act for U2 on the Australian and New Zealand leg of their U2 360° Tour, beginning in Auckland, New Zealand, in November 2010, followed by Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth in December.

Jay-Z also appeared on stage during U2 performances of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, and in Auckland also on a five-track EP entitled &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;, although it was later revealed by West that the project had become a full-length LP. Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. The first single released for the project was &quot;H•A•M&quot;. The track was co-produced by Lex Luger and West himself. The track ended up being on the deluxe edition of the album. The follow-up to that was the second single &quot;Otis&quot;, which premiered on Funkmaster Flex&#x27;s Hot 97 radio show, and was later released to the iTunes Store eleven days later. The song&#x27;s existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z. The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to its being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an internet leak. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke Coldplay&#x27;s record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record until Lil Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot; was released twenty-one days later, selling 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews. Jay-Z and West later gave a surprise performance of &quot;Otis&quot; at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.

===2012–2016: &quot;Magna Carta Holy Grail&quot; and other ventures===

Jay-Z collaborated with M.I.A on her single &quot;XXXO&quot;, which achieved a fair level of success and went on to become remixed by several producers worldwide. In May 2012, Jay-Z and former Philadelphia mayor Michael A. Nutter announced Jay-Z as the curator and the headliner for the first annual &quot;Budweiser Made in America&quot; festival at Fairmount Park in Philadelphia on September 1 and 2, 2012. The performance was produced by Live Nation and assembled an eclectic lineup of &quot;rock, hip hop, R&amp;B, Latin music and dance&quot; musicians. Jay-Z and Rihanna were the two main headlining acts for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s 2012 Hackney Weekend music festival on June 23 to 24. Jay-Z opened his set with an appearance from Rihanna, they performed &quot;Run this Town&quot;. On September 6, &quot;Clique&quot; was released, a single from the album &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, by GOOD Music. Kanye West and Big Sean starred alongside Jay-Z on the track. Jay-Z took the subway to his sold-out show at The Barclays Center on October 6, 2012. On November 12, 2012, Coldplay announced that they will be playing with Jay-Z at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31.

On September 23, 2010, Q-Tip confirmed working on Jay-Z&#x27;s follow-up album to &quot;The Blueprint 3&quot;, saying the album was to hit stores by spring 2011. In May 2012 it was reported that Jay-Z would work on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. Beats told &quot;XXL&quot; magazine: &quot;Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he&#x27;s working on. I don&#x27;t even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven&#x27;t even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, &#x27;Yo, I&#x27;ma go in on this,&#x27; or, &#x27;I like this.&#x27;&quot; The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by &quot;Complex Magazine&quot;, MTV, and &quot;XXL&quot;. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams. Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake&#x27;s comeback single &quot;Suit &amp; Tie&quot; from his third studio album &quot;The 20/20 Experience&quot;, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake&#x27;s mutual friend, Timbaland. Timberlake and Jay-Z embarked on the co-headlining Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour.

During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced his twelfth studio album, &quot;Magna Carta Holy Grail&quot;, and was released on July 4, 2013. Not long after, Jay-Z confirmed that the hyphen in his stage name would be left out and officially stylized in all capital letters. &quot;Magna Carta Holy Grail&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which bypassed its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000.
In December 2013, it was announced that Jay-Z had received nine nominations at the 2014 Grammy Awards, more than any other artist. Jay-Z appeared on his wife Beyoncé&#x27;s self-titled fifth studio album, &quot;Beyoncé&quot;, with a feature on the song &quot;Drunk in Love&quot;. They performed this song together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards opening. The song and its accompanying album would later win three Grammy Awards including Best R&amp;B Performance at the 2015 ceremony. In 2016, he won a lawsuit for the song &quot;Made in America&quot; with Kanye West featuring Frank Ocean against Joel McDonald.

===2017–present: &quot;4:44&quot; and &quot;Everything Is Love&quot;===

In early June 2017, posters were displayed in New York City and Los Angeles, and banner ads were placed on the Internet promoting a Tidal-related project titled &quot;4:44&quot;. A teaser ad was aired during the NBA Finals on June 7 featuring actors Mahershala Ali, Lupita Nyong&#x27;o and Danny Glover in a one-minute video, ending in &quot;4:44 – 6.30.17, Exclusively on Tidal&quot;. On June 18, the project was confirmed to be a new Jay-Z album, and a clip featuring a song titled &quot;Adnis&quot; was posted on Sprint&#x27;s YouTube page.

&quot;4:44&quot; was released through Roc Nation and Universal Music Group, as an exclusive to Sprint and Tidal customers. The album is the first in a planned series of music exclusives from the Sprint–Tidal partnership. For a short time, on July 2, the album was made available for free digital download in Tidal&#x27;s site. A physical edition was released on July 7, including three additional tracks. On the same day, the album was made available to other streaming platforms, such as Apple Music, Google Play Music and Amazon Music.

The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its emotional and personal content. On July 5, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), in recognition of one million copies purchased by Sprint and offered to consumers as free downloads. It debuted at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Jay-Z&#x27;s 13th consecutive studio album to top the chart. The album spawned two singles, the title track &quot;4:44&quot; and &quot;Bam&quot;, as well as several music videos, directed by a variety of high-profile collaborators. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Album of the Year, while the title track was nominated for Song of the Year and &quot;The Story of O.J.&quot; was nominated for Record of the Year at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.

On June 6, 2018, Jay-Z and Beyoncé kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled &quot;Everything Is Love&quot;, their much-awaited joint studio album, credited under the name &quot;The Carters&quot;. The pair also released the video for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Apeshit&quot;, on Beyoncé&#x27;s official YouTube channel. The song won two awards from eight nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.

In 2021, Jay-Z was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with fellow rapper LL Cool J. He also appeared on the song &quot;Jail&quot; on Kanye West&#x27;s 2021 album &quot;Donda&quot;, which went on to win Grammy Award for Best Rap Song at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards and on the song &quot;Love All&quot; from Drake&#x27;s 2021 album &quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot;.

In 2022, his first feature was a collaboration with fellow rapper Pusha T, &quot;Neck &amp; Wrist&quot; featuring Pharrell Williams from Pusha T&#x27;s album, &quot;It&#x27;s Almost Dry&quot;. His feature was succeeded by a four-minute guest appearance on DJ Khaled&#x27;s album title track, &quot;God Did&quot;. He also was awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), as a producer for the Super Bowl LVI halftime show.

==Musical style==
===Influences===
Jay-Z says his earliest exposure to music was through his parents&#x27; record collection, which was mostly of soul artists such as Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. He says &quot;I grew up around music, listening to all types of people... I&#x27;m into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R&amp;B, pop music, whatever. As long as I can feel their soul through the wax, that&#x27;s what I really listen to.&quot; He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West productions included on &quot;The Blueprint.&quot;

===Rapping technique===
Known for his lyrical prowess which often utilises double entendres, witty wordplays, and mixes messages with braggadocio, his music often describes his rise from poverty to vast wealth.

Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; and Fredro Starr of Onyx both describe Jay-Z&#x27;s emphasis on flow in the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;—Starr says that Jay-Z is &quot;a master of the flow—he can flow fast, he can flow slow&quot;. The book describes how Jay-Z uses &#x27;rests&#x27; to provide structure to a verse and how he uses &#x27;partial linking&#x27; to add more rhymes to a verse. Jay-Z&#x27;s early style is described by &quot;Vibe&quot; as &quot;a distinctly Das EFX-type, stiggety style&quot; on his 12&quot; single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get With That&quot;, referring to the fast rhythms and vocal delivery of the group Das EFX. He is also known to write lyrics in his head, as described by Pusha T of Clipse in &quot;How to Rap&quot;, a style popular with many MCs such as The Notorious B.I.G., Everlast, Bobby Creekwater and Guerilla Black. Shock G of Digital Underground describes Jay-Z&#x27;s live performance style, saying he &quot;rarely breaks a sweat, and instead uses smoothness and clever wordplay to keep the audience interested and entertained&quot;. Jay-Z&#x27;s fast rapping technique, also known as the &quot;triplet time&quot;, was developed during his early years of creating music with former mentor Jaz-O.

==Business career==
Jay-Z has also established himself as a successful entrepreneur with a business empire spanning a variety of industries from clothing lines, beverages, real estate, sport teams, and record labels. In an interview, he stated that &quot;my brands are an extension of me. They&#x27;re close to me. It&#x27;s not like running GM, where there&#x27;s no emotional attachment.&quot;

=== Rocawear ===
Jay-Z and Damon Dash are the founders of the urban clothing brand Rocawear. Rocawear has clothing lines and accessories for men, women and children. The line was taken over by Jay-Z in early 2006 following a falling out with Dash. In March 2007, Jay-Z sold the rights to the Rocawear brand to Iconix Brand Group for $204 million. He retains his stake in the company and continues to oversee the marketing, licensing and product development.

=== Reebok ===
Jay-Z became the first rapper in Reebok&#x27;s history to endorse the company&#x27;s footwear, signing a three-year endorsement deal. He later appeared in a 2003 Reebok collection advertising his S. Carter Collection. Later that year, he and frenemy 50 Cent appeared in a commercial to promote their S. Carter and G-Unit footwears for the company, with a Just Blaze-produced song made for it.

In 2006, Jay-Z&#x27;s deal with Reebok expired with no renewal.

=== Alcoholic beverages ===
In 2014, Jay-Z invested $200 million in Armand de Brignac champagne—owned at the time by Sovereign Brands, a New York–based wine and spirits company—for a 100 percent stake, making it the second alcoholic product acquisition in his financial investment portfolio. The brand is known for its popularity with high-profile artists as being the gold bottles often referred to in media. His ties to the company date back to 2006, and he received millions of dollars per year for his association with Armand de Brignac before he bought the entire company.

Jay-Z serves as co-brand director for Budweiser Select and collaborates with the company on strategic marketing programs and creative ad development. He provides direction on brand programs and ads that appear on TV, radio, print, and high-profile events.

=== Technology ===
In March 2015, Jay-Z completed the $56 million acquisition of Aspiro, a Norwegian media technology company that operates the subscription-based music streaming service Tidal, which has been in operation since October 2014. The music service was acquired through his company Project Panther Bidco Ltd. (an entity indirectly owned by Jay-Z&#x27;s S. Carter Enterprises a company holding interests in leading international music, media and entertainment companies). The music service combines audio and music videos with curated editorial. The main idea of the service is to bring major revenue streams back to the music artists themselves as the idea of an artist-owned streaming platform was stated as to &quot;restore the value to music by launching a service owned by artists.&quot; Jay-Z currently is a major shareholder in the company.

In July 2015, Carter made a significant investment to JetSmarter, an app helping people book private executive plane flights. The app was built by Sergey Petrossov.

=== Music industry ===
From 2005 to 2007, Jay-Z was inaugurated as the president of Def Jam Recordings. Under Jay-Z&#x27;s leadership, Def Jam launched the successful careers of contemporary R&amp;B singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo. At the end of 2007, after he released &quot;American Gangster&quot;, Jay-Z decided not to renew his contract as the president and CEO of Def Jam. Shortly after, he started his Live Nation venture, Roc Nation.

In April 2011, it was reported that Jay-Z had outbid executives at Universal Music and Jive Records to acquire independent record label Block Starz Music.

=== Sporting business ===
For a decade (2003–2013), Jay-Z enjoyed his role as a part-owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team, having paid a reported $1 million for his share, which declined in value to $350,000 in April 2013, based on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s valuation of the team. He encouraged the team&#x27;s relocation to Brooklyn&#x27;s Barclays Center (from New Jersey) in the 2012–2013 season, at which point the team took on the Brooklyn Nets moniker.

On April 18, 2013, Jay-Z officially announced through his Life + Times website in a press release that he would be relinquishing his ownership in the Brooklyn Nets. The shares were eventually sold to singer, rapper, actor and entrepreneur Will Pan, making Pan the first American of Taiwanese descent to own a U.S. professional sports franchise. Jay-Z&#x27;s cited Pan&#x27;s athletic background (he was a team captain of his high school basketball team and played in college), his multitude of musical styles, his influence in the Taiwanese American community, and his business acumen and portfolio (including being the founder and chief executive of software company Camigo Media and a co-founder of streetwear boutique N.P.C [New Project Center]), as reasons why his bid was successful.

In September 2013, his stake in Barclays Center was sold for $1.5 million.

On April 2, 2013, ESPN reported Jay-Z&#x27;s plans to launch his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports, with a focus on the representation of various professional athletes. The sport management group is a partnership with Creative Artists Agency. In conjunction with the agency&#x27;s launch, New York Yankees&#x27;s second baseman Robinson Canó left agent Scott Boras to sign with the company. ESPN also mentioned that Jay-Z himself was planning to be a certified sports agent, first in baseball and eventually in basketball and football. In order to represent clients in basketball, he would have to give up his small share of the Brooklyn Nets.

In October 2005, he was reported in English media as considering buying a stake of Arsenal F.C., an English soccer team. Through his conglomerate company Gain Global Investments Network LLC, he had an interest estimated between 2 and 7% in the Aqueduct Entertainment Group (AEG) consortium, which in January 2010 was awarded a contract to operate a 4,500-slot-machine racino at the Aqueduct Race Track. Jay-Z became interested in the project after New York Governor David Paterson who awarded the contract said there had to be an affirmative action component to the ownership. Jay-Z was initially approached by casino mogul Steve Wynn, who was also bidding on the contract. On March 9, 2010, Jay-Z and Flake withdrew from the project, and Paterson recused himself from further involvement.

=== Media ===
On April 5, 2011, Jay-Z launched the popular culture and lifestyle online magazine &quot;Life + Times&quot;. It features content that showcases his high-end tastes in clothing, appliances, and cars. The site design is aesthetically aimed at the upwardly mobile young male demographic, with sports and music-related posts accompanying those about fashion and design. Among the music content is the &quot;Decoded&quot; series, originating from Jay-Z&#x27;s memoir of the same name and featuring a select rapper deciphering their own lyrics.

In January 2015, after being contacted by the webzine, the DJ and radio host Funkmaster Flex revealed that he had been contacted in 2013 for a story about a digital app he made at the time, but alleged that the information was instead used to help launch the &quot;Magna Carta&quot; Samsung app for the release of Jay-Z&#x27;s album of the same name. &quot;But I was good with that. I ate that. Everybody&#x27;s out here hustling&quot;, Flex reasoned to &quot;Vibe&quot;.

In 2016, he signed a two-year exclusive film and TV Deal with Weinstein Company and with the deal gives them first-look options to create scripted and unscripted TV projects and film projects, and those projects were in works. As part of his deal with Weinstein company, he produced a documentary series on the life of Kalief Browder who was imprisoned for three years and committed suicide upon his release. He also addressed racial profiling and police brutality in a conscious manner.

=== Other ventures ===
Jay-Z also co-owns the 40/40 Club, an upscale sports bar that started in New York City, and has since expanded to Atlantic City and Chicago. In 2008, the 40/40 Club in Las Vegas was closed down and bought back by the hotel after attendance steadily declined. In 2005, Jay-Z became an investor in Carol&#x27;s Daughter, a line of beauty products, including products for hair, skin, and hands.

In 2010, he announced plans to expand his 40/40 Club sports bar chain into as many as 20 airports, joining his Roc Nation business partners, husband and wife Juan and Desiree Perez, in a deal with Delaware North.

On November 16, 2010, Jay-Z published a memoir entitled &quot;Decoded.&quot; The memoir was co-signed by Dream Hampton.

Parlux fragrances sued Jay-Z for $18 million for the failure of his cologne, &quot;Gold&quot;. They claim the cologne&#x27;s failure is due to Jay-Z not doing social media posts and interviews about the cologne. Parlux claims they projected selling $15 million the first year, and $35 million the second, and subsequent years after the launch. The fragrance sold $14 million the first year and $6.1 million the second. Parlux lost money on the venture and have had constant returns of unsold inventory.

Jay-Z collaborated with Cohiba to launch his own cigars.

In August 2020, Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc Nation partnered with Brooklyn&#x27;s Long Island University to establish the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports &amp; Entertainment.

In November 2020, it was announced that Jay-Z would be join TPCO Holding Corp., a newly formed cannabis products company, in the role of &quot;Chief Visionary Officer&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 2002, Jay-Z and singer Beyoncé Knowles collaborated on the song &quot;&#x27;03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;. He also appeared on Beyoncé&#x27;s hit single, &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; the following year, as well as the song &quot;That&#x27;s How You Like It&quot; from her debut album &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; (2003). On her second album, &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot;, he made appearances on the hits &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; and &quot;Upgrade U&quot;. In the video for the latter song, she comically imitates his appearance. They kept a low profile while dating, and were married on April 4, 2008, in a private ceremony in Tribeca, New York City. Their relationship became a matter of public record on April 22, 2008, although Beyoncé did not publicly debut her US$5 million Lorraine Schwartz-designed wedding ring until the Fashion Rocks concert on September 5, 2008. Since their marriage, they generally avoid discussing their relationship, and Beyoncé has stated her belief that this has helped them, while Jay-Z agreed in a &quot;People&quot; article that they do not &quot;play with [their] relationship&quot;.

In 2006, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people. In January 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked them as Hollywood&#x27;s top-earning couple, with a combined total of $162 million. They made it to the top of the list the following year, with a combined total of US$122 million between June 2008 and June 2009.

At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé revealed that she was pregnant with their first child. Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born at New York&#x27;s Lenox Hill Hospital on January 7, 2012. Jay-Z released &quot;Glory&quot;, a song dedicated to Blue Ivy, through his Life+Times website on January 9, 2012. The song, produced by frequent collaborators the Neptunes, detailed the couple&#x27;s pregnancy struggles, including a miscarriage Beyoncé had suffered. Blue Ivy&#x27;s cries were included at the end of the song, and she was officially credited on the song as &quot;B.I.C&quot;; she became the youngest person in &quot;Billboard&quot; history (at two days old) have a chart entry when &quot;Glory&quot; debuted at No. 74 on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs.

On June 18, 2017, Beyoncé&#x27;s father Mathew Knowles confirmed that she had given birth to twins with Jay-Z, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir. In the following months, they purchased a US$88 million home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.

In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in California.

==Legal issues==

=== 1999 Lance &quot;Un&quot; Rivera stabbing ===
On December 2, 1999, Jay-Z, who had come to believe that record executive Lance &quot;Un&quot; Rivera was behind the bootlegging of &quot;Vol. 3...&quot;, allegedly stabbed him at the Kit Kat Klub, a now-defunct night club in Times Square, New York City, during a release party for Q-Tip&#x27;s album &quot;Amplified&quot;. Jay-Z&#x27;s associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover while he stabbed Rivera in the stomach with a blade. He surrendered to police the following evening and was placed under arrest, although he was soon released on $50,000 bail. When he was indicted in Manhattan Criminal Court in late January 2000, he pleaded not guilty; he and his lawyers contended that they had witnesses and videotapes proving he had been nowhere near Rivera during the incident. Nevertheless, he later pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and accepted a three-year probation sentence.

Jay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book &quot;Decoded&quot;:

In 2023, Rivera stated that Jay-Z lied, and was not the one that stabbed him: &quot;No. Jay-Z was not the guy that actually stabbed me that night (...) it&#x27;s never been his history&quot;. Rapper Nas, who feuded with Jay-Z in the early 2000&#x27;s, had also claimed in his 2001 diss track &quot;Ether&quot; that Jay-Z was not Rivera&#x27;s stabber. Rivera commented on this, stating, &quot;The reality to it is Nas — and I don’t know why didn’t nobody believe him — on &#x27;Ether&#x27; he talked about the incident. He let people know like, &#x27;Yo, your man stabbed Un and you took the blame for it.&#x27;&quot;

===2024 civil lawsuits===

In December 2024, Jay-Z, along with Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs, was accused in a civil lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old girl at an MTV Video Music Awards after-party in 2000. Jay-Z denied the allegations and described it as a blackmail attempt. Jay-Z responded to the plaintiff&#x27;s lawyer Tony Buzbee on social media that &quot;No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!&quot; Combs&#x27;s legal team described this allegation as another in a long line of lies about Combs. On December 9, Jay-Z filed both a motion requesting that the accuser identify themselves and a lawsuit against the accuser&#x27;s attorney.

According to the plaintiff&#x27;s lawyer, Tony Buzbee, the plaintiff did not demand any money; only confidential mediation. Buzbee filed an amended complaint to the court, where he alleged that Jay-Z conducted a &quot;conspiracy of harassment, bullying and intimidation against Plaintiff&#x27;s lawyers&quot; to prevent the Plaintiff from publicly naming him. Days later on December 13th, the accuser admitted that there are inconsistencies in her allegation. Among them, she claimed her father drove five hours to pick her up after the alleged incident, but he says he has no recollection of doing that. She claims that another celebrity had been a witness but he stated that he had not been in New York then. Images from the night show that Carter and Combs had verifiably been in separate locations that night. She claimed the band members of Good Charlotte witnessed the event, but they had actually been on tour in the Midwest at the time, not at the 2000 MTV VMAs, after which the accuser claims the alleged incident took place. On December 18, Carter filed a motion to remove himself as a defendant in the lawsuit against Combs based on what the accuser claimed in the televised interview. The same day, however, Buzbee filed a lawsuit against Carter&#x27;s company Roc Nation, law firm Quinn Emanuel—which employs Carter&#x27;s attorneys—and others, claiming that these parties were attempting to sway his clients into suing him and his firm, the Buzbee Law Firm. According to Buzbee, Roc Nation paid off some of his former clients to file bogus lawsuits, while Quinn Emanuel orchestrated the scheme. Buzbee stated that he had, among other things, audio tapes proving his allegation against Roc Nation and Quinn Emanuel, and would provide the tapes as evidence. On December 26, the judge dismissed Carter&#x27;s plea to have the plaintiff identify herself, allowing her to remain anonymous. In February 2025 Jay-Z dropped his request to have Tony Buzbee sanctioned by the court.

On February 10, 2025, Jay-Z filed a lawsuit against Tony Buzbee, stating he lost $20 million in contracts due to the allegations.

On February 14, 2025, the lawsuit against Jay-Z was officially dropped by Tony Buzbee and the accuser. A filing in federal court in Manhattan stated that the anonymous plaintiff, referred to as Jane Doe, voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice, not allowing for a future refiling. Shortly thereafter, Jay-Z described the outcome as &quot;a victory.&quot; The suit was dismissed without settlement.

==Philanthropy==

During his first retirement from music, Jay-Z became involved in philanthropy. In 2003, along with his mother, Jay-Z founded the Shawn Carter Foundation, which assists eligible students facing socio-economic hardships attend and get through college. In August 2006, he met with Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United Nations at the organization&#x27;s New York City headquarters, where he pledged to use his upcoming world tour to raise awareness of the global water shortage, a challenge he learned about following a visit to Africa by Bono, the lead singer of U2. The effort took place in partnership with the UN, as well as MTV, which produced a documentary entitled &quot;Diary of Jay-Z: Water for Life&quot;, first airing in November 2006. Along with Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs, Jay-Z pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross&#x27;s relief effort after Hurricane Katrina. Jay-Z supported Kanye West after West&#x27;s outburst against President George W. Bush during a live Katrina charity telethon. He also addressed the Katrina disaster and the federal government&#x27;s response in his one-verse song &quot;Minority Report&quot;.

Jay-Z has said that &quot;the greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous&quot;. In 2013, author dream hampton, who co-wrote Jay-Z&#x27;s book &quot;Decoded&quot;, revealed that Jay-Z had established a trust fund for Sean Bell&#x27;s children.

Jay-Z donated to bail out protestors arrested during 2015 activism against police brutality.

In March 2020, Jay-Z donated $1 million through the Shawn Carter Foundation to aid in relief during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. In April 2020, along with Meek Mill, he donated over 100,000 face masks to U.S. prisons to assist in protecting prison inmates from COVID-19.

==Political involvement==

In 2006, Jay-Z appeared with Russell Simmons in a public service announcement denouncing racism and anti-Semitism, sponsored by the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding. In 2008, Jay-Z was involved in the 2008 United States presidential election, supporting enhanced voter participation. He supported the 2008 presidential candidacy of Barack Obama and performed voter-drive concerts financed by the Democrats&#x27; campaign. He also became acquainted with Obama, who in June 2008 said, &quot;Every time I talk to Jay-Z, who is a brilliant talent and a good guy, I enjoy how he thinks. That&#x27;s somebody who is going to start branching out and can help shape attitudes in a real positive way.&quot;

During the 2010 mid-term elections, Jay-Z appeared with other artists in a HeadCount advertisement, urging voters, especially younger ones, to register and vote. In May 2012, Jay-Z endorsed President Obama&#x27;s support of same-sex marriage and participated in his re-election campaign.

Musician and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte was critical of Jay-Z and Beyoncé for what he saw as their safe political stances, saying that they &quot;have turned their back on social responsibility&quot;.

In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Jay-Z and Beyoncé appeared at a Hillary Clinton rally in Cleveland. Clinton praised Jay-Z for addressing racism, oppression, and the criminal justice system. He described Donald Trump as a &quot;superbug&quot; and condemned remarks he perceived as racist, but later said that Trump&#x27;s rhetoric forced people to come together and address difficult issues such as white privilege.

<text>Swiss International Air Lines [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]], stylized as SWISS, is the flag carrier of Switzerland and a subsidiary of the Lufthansa Group, as well as a Star Alliance member. It operates scheduled services in Europe and to North America, South America, Africa and Asia. Zurich Airport serves as its main hub and Geneva Airport as its secondary hub.

Its headquarters are at Kloten (near Zurich Airport), Switzerland, and an office at Zurich Airport in Kloten, Switzerland. The company&#x27;s registered office is in Basel.

The airline was formed following the bankruptcy in 2002 of Swissair, Switzerland&#x27;s then-flag carrier. The new airline was built around what had been Swissair&#x27;s regional subsidiary, Crossair. &quot;Swiss&quot; retains Crossair&#x27;s IATA code &quot;LX&quot; (Swissair&#x27;s code was &quot;SR&quot;). It assumed Swissair&#x27;s old ICAO code of &quot;SWR&quot; (Crossair&#x27;s was &quot;CRX&quot;), to maintain international traffic rights.

==History==


===Beginnings===
Swiss was formed after the 2002 bankruptcy of Swissair, Switzerland&#x27;s former flag carrier. Forty percent of Crossair&#x27;s income came from Swissair. The new airline lost US$1.6 billion from 2002 to 2005. Swissair&#x27;s biggest creditors, Credit Suisse and UBS, sold part of Swissair&#x27;s assets to Crossair, which had been Swissair&#x27;s regional counterpart. At the time, both Swissair and Crossair were part of the same holding company, SAirGroup. Crossair later changed its name to &quot;Swiss International Air Lines&quot;, and the new national airline officially started operations on 31 March 2002. The airline was initially owned by institutional investors (61.3%), the Swiss Confederation (20.3%), cantons and communities (12.2%), and others (6.2%). Swiss also owns subsidiaries Swiss Sun (100%) and Crossair Europe (99.9%). It has a total of 7,383 employees.

According to Marcel Biedermann, the managing director of intercontinental markets for Swiss, there were three possibilities: stay independent as a niche carrier, shrink to an unrecognisable level, or attach to another airline group. The last choice was taken. Swiss talked to Air France–KLM, British Airways, and Lufthansa. However, Swiss was tied up with debt and an uncertain future and seemed to be an unattractive investment. After merging with KLM, Air France said they were too busy to deal with the Swiss joining them. British Airways was open, and Oneworld partners thought Zurich Airport would be a viable alternative hub for London Heathrow.

After almost a year of disputes, Swiss was finally accepted into the Oneworld airline alliance, after having been blocked by British Airways, which competes with Swiss on many long-haul routes. On 3 June 2004, Swiss announced its decision not to join Oneworld because they did not want to integrate their current frequent flyer program into British Airways&#x27; Executive Club. Furthermore, Swiss thought the relationship was one-sided, where British Airways sapped out the benefits of the airline, but they would get no return.

===Recovery===
The airline annually halved its losses, and in 2006 recorded a net profit of $220 million. The net profit for 2007 was $570 million. Biedermann stated in the March 2008 edition of &quot;Airways&quot;, that &quot;this was the beginning of getting our house back in order.&quot; He said that help was needed and looked up to Lufthansa as a comparison, so their coming together was natural, even with their differences. Even with the smaller network, Swiss carried the same number of passengers as it did in 2002.

On 22 March 2005, Lufthansa Group confirmed its plan to take over Swiss, starting with a minority stake (11%) in a new company set up to hold Swiss shares called Air Trust. &quot;Swiss&quot; operations were gradually integrated with Lufthansa&#x27;s in late 2005, and the takeover was completed on 1 July 2007. Swiss joined Star Alliance and became a member of Lufthansa&#x27;s Miles and More frequent flyer program on 1 April 2006.

The airline set up a regional airline subsidiary called Swiss European Air Lines. The carrier had its own air operator&#x27;s certificate. Two divisions – Swiss Aviation Training and Swiss WorldCargo (using the belly capacity of passenger planes) – are also owned by Swiss. Swiss European Air Lines (later renamed Swiss Global Air Lines) has since ceased operations and merged with its parent, Swiss.

In 2008, Swiss International Air Lines acquired Edelweiss Air and Servair, later renamed Swiss Private Aviation. In February 2011, Swiss Private Aviation ceased operations as a result of restructuring. The company recommended using Lufthansa Private Jet Service instead.

In 2007, Swiss ordered nine Airbus A330-300s to gradually replace existing A330-200s and have three-class seating. The first A330-300 was put into service on the flagship Zürich to New York-JFK route in April 2009. In spring 2010 Swiss operated five A330-300s on medium and long-haul routes. The remaining four A330-300 aircraft joined the fleet in 2011.

===Takeover by Lufthansa===
Following Lufthansa Group&#x27;s takeover, the regional fleet was changed from Crossair&#x27;s Embraer ERJs, Saab 340s, and 2000s to Avro RJs, which were flown by a wholly owned subsidiary, Swiss Global Air Lines. The rest of the fleet was rationalised and now mainly consists of Airbus aircraft, apart from the Boeing 777. Swiss also renegotiated their supplier contracts, including ground handling, maintenance, food service, and labour. Swiss shareholders received a performance-based option for their shares. The payment was in 2008, and the amount depended on how well Lufthansa&#x27;s shares compared with competitors&#x27; shares. Lufthansa continues to maintain Swiss as a separate brand.

In 2010, Swiss and Lufthansa were named in a European Commission investigation into price-fixing but were not fined due to acting as a whistleblower.

On 18 August 2011, Swiss introduced a new company logo which resembled the logo of the defunct Swissair.

=== COVID-19 losses and bailout ===
Swiss was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It reported revenues for 2020 of CHF 1.85 billion, which were 65.2% below its prior-year level.

In August 2020, Swiss received a CHF1.5 billion ($1.65 billion) state-backed loan from the Swiss government to weather the pandemic. The use of Swiss state funds was criticized by some commentators because Swiss is a fully-owned subsidiary of German airline Lufthansa, making questions regarding its survival the responsibility of the German government, which had similarly lent a helping hand to Lufthansa during the pandemic.

On 18 November 2020, it was announced that Dieter Vranckx would assume the position of CEO as of 1 January 2021. Vranckx has 20 years of experience within the Lufthansa Group and has been CEO of Lufthansa Group member Brussels Airlines since the start of 2020.

In June 2024, it was announced that Vranckx would step down by the end of the month and be replaced by German national and Lufthansa CityLine Managing Director, Jens Fehlinger. Fehlinger will assume office in October 2024, and until then Swiss will be temporarily led by Head of Commercial, Heike Birlenbach. Dieter Vranckx transferred to the executive board of parent company Lufthansa on 1 July 2024, and remains with Swiss as vice chairman of its board of directors.

=== Expansion of flight operations ===
On 16 January 2025, it was reported that Swiss will resume its flight operation to Tel Aviv from 1 February 2025. The airline will fly daily from Zurich to Tel Aviv using its Airbus A320 aircraft.

==Corporate affairs==
=== Business trends ===
The key trends for Swiss International Air Lines are (as of the financial year ending 31 December):
===Head office===
Swiss International Air Lines has its operational headquarters at EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg near Basel, Switzerland. The French-Swiss airport is located on French territory and has customs-free access to Switzerland. The Swiss head office is located in the Swiss section of the airport, and it is only accessible from Switzerland. According to the commercial register, the legal seat is in Basel itself.

Swiss International Air Lines&#x27; head office was previously the head office of Crossair. In 2002 the &quot;Crossair&quot; sign on the building was replaced by a &quot;Swiss International Air Lines&quot; one. As of 2004 the Basel area offices housed about 1,000 employees, while the Zurich area offices housed about 850 employees. When Swiss started as a company, about 1,400-1,500 worked at the Basel offices.

Swiss also operates offices at Zurich Airport in Kloten and at Geneva Airport.

Economy class on short-haul flights only include a bottle of water and a small bar of Swiss chocolate branded with the word &quot;SWISS&quot; and the distinctive tail fin is provided to passengers before landing on all flights. For its short- to mid-haul flight out of Geneva Airport and Zürich Airport, SWISS offers a culinary buy-on-board system called &quot;Swiss Saveurs&quot;.

===Trains and buses===
Swiss&#x27; &quot;SWISS Air Rail&quot; service allows passengers to take any SBB train at no extra charge from Zurich Airport to Basel SBB railway station and Lugano railway station.

===Fleet development===
On 22 September 2010, Lufthansa announced an order for 48 new aircraft, several of them for Swiss.

In March 2013, Swiss ordered six Boeing 777-300ERs. On 12 March 2015, Swiss confirmed Lufthansa Group had ordered an additional three Boeing 777-300ERs for Swiss. The 777s will be operated by, and leased back from, Swiss Global Air Lines. Swiss has confirmed that all 777-300ERs will have an updated First Class cabin with eight private suites and a 32-inch TV, 62 business class seats which convert into a fully flat bed that is over two meters long, and 270 economy seats, with 10 seats abreast in a 3-4-3 layout, using the same seat pitch and width on its A330s and A340s on the 777s. The first of these new airliners was delivered in January 2016 The Boeing aircraft will replace most of Swiss&#x27; A340 aircraft while the remaining five A340s were refurbished.

In 2014, Swiss announced it would refurbish its A320 fleet, with new interiors and the older A320s and A321s were to be replaced by A320/A321neos. The A319s and Swiss Global Air Lines&#x27; Avro fleet, were replaced by Bombardier CS300 aircraft. The last Avro RJ100 aircraft, HB-IYZ, completed its final flight, LX7545 from Geneva to Zurich on 15 August 2017.

Swiss&#x27; first Airbus A220, then known as the Bombardier CS300, entered service on 1 June 2017, with its maiden commercial flight from Geneva to London–Heathrow. Swiss was the launch customer of the Airbus A220 family (formerly known as Bombardier CSeries), with its first CSeries aircraft, a CS100 (A220-100), delivered to the airline in June 2016 and registered HB-JBA. The first commercial flight performed led from Zurich to Paris-Charles de Gaulle.

The Boeing 777-300ER and Airbus A220-100/-300 (Bombardier CS100/CS300) aircraft were operated by Swiss Global Air Lines until the subsidiary ceased operations in April 2018, in an attempt to lower administration costs and simplify Swiss&#x27; fleet structuring.

Adria Airways operated two Saab 2000s on the Zurich-Lugano route, which was suspended after Adria&#x27;s bankruptcy on 30 September 2019.

In December 2024, it was reported that Swiss will be receiving a further five Airbus A350-900 widebody long-haul aircraft from 2027 onwards, on top of another five aircraft which are on order, with gradual delivery between the summer of 2025 to 2031.

<doc id="162874" wikidata="Q416206" url="?curid=162874" title="Pentamidine">
<text>Pentamidine is an antimicrobial medication used to treat African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, &quot;Balamuthia&quot; infections, babesiosis, and to prevent and treat pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in people with poor immune function. In African trypanosomiasis it is used for early disease before central nervous system involvement, as a second line option to suramin. It is an option for both visceral leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Pentamidine can be given by injection into a vein or muscle or by inhalation.

Common side effects of the injectable form include low blood sugar, pain at the site of injection, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, and kidney problems. Common side effects of the inhaled form include wheezing, cough, and nausea. It is unclear if doses should be changed in those with kidney or liver problems. Pentamidine is not recommended in early pregnancy but may be used in later pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is unclear. Pentamidine is in the aromatic diamidine family of medications. While the way the medication works is not entirely clear, it is believed to involve decreasing the production of DNA, RNA, and protein.

Pentamidine came into medical use in 1937. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In regions of the world where trypanosomiasis is common pentamidine is provided for free by the World Health Organization (WHO).

==Medical uses==
* Treatment of PCP caused by &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot;
* Prevention of PCP in adults with HIV who have one or both of the following:
** History of PCP
** CD4+ count ≤ 200mm³
* Treatment of leishmaniasis
* Treatment of African trypanosomiasis caused by &quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot;
* &quot;Balamuthia&quot; infections
* Pentamidine is classified as an orphan drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

===Other uses===
* Use as an antitumor drug has also been proposed.
* Pentamidine is also identified as a potential small molecule antagonist that disrupts this interaction between S100P and RAGE receptor.

=== Special Populations ===

==== Pregnancy ====
It has not been shown to cause birth defects in animal studies when given intravenously. There are no controlled studies to show if pentamidine can harm the fetus in pregnant women. It is only recommended if the drug of choice trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated.

==== Breastfeeding ====
There is no information regarding the excretion of pentamidine in breast milk, but since the adverse effects on breastfed infants are unknown currently, it is recommended by the manufacturer for the infant to not be breastfed or for the mother to stop the drug. Risks versus benefits for the mother should be considered when making this decision.

==== Children ====
Pentamidine can be used in the prevention of PCP in children with HIV who cannot tolerate Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole and can use a nebulizer. Intranvenous solutions of pentamidine should only be used in children with HIV older than 2 years old when other treatments are unavailable

==== Elderly ====
There is no data for the use of pentamidine in this specific population.

==Contraindications==
* Patients with a history of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity to pentamidine isethionate

==Side effects==

=== Common ===
* Burning pain, dryness, or sensation of lump in throat
* Chest pain
* Coughing
* difficulty in breathing
* difficulty in swallowing
* skin rash
* wheezing

=== Rare ===
* Nausea and vomiting
* Pain in upper abdomen, possibly radiating to the back
* Severe pain in side of chest
* Shortness of breath

=== Others ===
* Blood: Pentamidine frequently causes leukopenia and less often thrombopenia, which may cause symptomatic bleeding. Some cases of anemia, possibly related to folic acid deficiency, have been described.
* Cardiovascular: Hypotension, which may be severe. Severe or fatal arrhythmias and heart failure are quite frequent.
* Kidney: 25 percent develop signs of nephrotoxicity ranging from mild, asymptomatic azotemia (increased serum creatinine and urea) to irreversible renal failure. Ample fluids or intravenous hydration may prevent some nephrotoxicity.
* Liver: Elevated liver enzymes are associated with intravenous use of pentamidine. Hepatomegaly and hepatitis have been encountered with long term prophylactic use of pentamidine inhalation.
* Neurological: Dizziness, drowsiness, neuralgia, confusion, hallucinations, seizures and other central side effects are reported.
* Pancreas: Hypoglycemia that requires symptomatic treatment is frequently seen. On the other hand, pentamidine may cause or worsen diabetes mellitus.
* Respiratory: Cough and bronchospasm, most frequently seen with inhalation.
* Skin: Severe local reactions after extravasculation of intravenous solutions or following intramuscular injection treatment have been seen. Pentamidine itself may cause rash, or rarely Stevens–Johnson syndrome or Lyell syndrome.
* Eye discomfort, conjunctivitis, throat irritation, splenomegaly, Herxheimer reaction, electrolyte imbalances (e.g. hypocalcemia).

==Drug interactions==
The additional or sequential use of other nephrotoxic drugs like aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, capreomycin, colistin, polymyxin B, vancomycin, foscarnet, or cisplatin should be closely monitored, or whenever possible completely avoided.

==Mechanism of action==
The mechanism seems to vary with different organisms and is not well understood. However, pentamidine is suspected to work through various methods of interference of critical functions in DNA, RNA, phospholipid and protein synthesis. Pentamidine binds to adenine-thymine-rich regions of the &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; parasite DNA, forming a cross-link between two adenines four to five base pairs apart. The drug also inhibits topoisomerase enzymes in the mitochondria of &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot;. Similarly, pentamidine inhibits type II topoisomerase in the mitochondria of the &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; parasite, resulting in a broken and unreadable mitochondrial genome.

=== Resistance ===
Strains of the &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot; parasite that are resistant to pentamidine have been discovered. Pentamidine is brought into the mitochondria through carrier proteins, and the absence of these carriers prevents the drug from reaching its site of action.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Absorption: Pentamidine is completely absorbed when given intravenously or intramuscularly. When inhaled through a nebulizer, pentamidine accumulates in the bronchoalveolar fluid of the lungs at a higher concentration compared to injections. The inhaled form is minimally absorbed in the blood. Absorption is unreliable when given orally.

Distribution: When injected, pentamidine binds to tissues and proteins in the plasma. It accumulates in the kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands. Additionally, pentamidine does not reach curative levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. It has a volume of distribution of 286-1356 liters when given intravenously and 1658-3790 liters when given intramuscularly. Inhaled pentamidine is mainly deposited into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the lungs.

Metabolism: Pentamidine is primarily metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Up to 12% of pentamidine is eliminated in the urine unchanged.

Elimination: Pentamidine has an average half-life of 5–8 hours when given intravenously and 7–11 hours when given intramuscularly. However, these may increase with severe kidney problems. Pentamidine can remain in the system for as long as 8 months after the first injection.

== Chemistry ==
Pentamidine isethionate for injection is commercially available as a lyophilized, white crystalline powder for reconstitution with sterile water or 5% Dextrose. After reconstitution, the mixture should be free from discoloration and precipitation. Reconstitution with sodium chloride should be avoided due to formation of precipitates. Intravenous solutions of pentamidine can be mixed with intravenous HIV medications like zidovidine and intravenous heart medications like diltiazem. However, intravenous solutions of antiviral foscarnet and antifungal fluconazole are incompatible with pentamidine. To avoid side-effects associated with intravenous administration, the solution should be slowly infused to minimize the release of histamine.

==History==
Pentamidine was first used to treat African trypanosomiasis in 1937 and leishmaniasis in 1940 before it was registered as pentamidine mesylate in 1950. 

The sudden increase in requests for use of Pentamidine isethionate in then unlicensed form from the CDC in the early 1980s for treating Pneumocystis jirovecii in young male patients was key in identifying the emergence of the HIV/AIDS epidemic at that time. 

Its efficacy against Pneumocystis jirovecii was demonstrated in 1987, following its re-emergence on the drug market in 1984 in the current isethionate form.

<text>Roy Ellsworth Harris (February 12, 1898 – October 1, 1979) was an American composer. He wrote music on American subjects, and is best known for his Symphony No. 3.

==Life==
Harris was born in Chandler, Oklahoma on February 12, 1898. His ancestry was Scottish, Irish and Welsh. In 1903, his father was able to combine the proceeds of the auction of his Oklahoma homestead with his winnings from a lucky gambling streak to purchase some land near Covina in the San Gabriel Valley of southern California and move the family there. Roy Harris grew up as a farmer in this rural, isolated environment. He studied piano with his mother, and later clarinet. Though he studied at the University of California, Berkeley, he was still virtually self-taught when he began writing music of his own. In the early 1920s, he had lessons from Arthur Bliss (then in Santa Barbara) and the senior American composer and researcher of American Indian music, Arthur Farwell. Harris sold his farmland and supported himself as a truck-driver and delivery man for a dairy farm. Gradually, he made contacts in the East with other young composers, and, partly through Aaron Copland&#x27;s recommendation, he was able to spend 1926–29 in Paris, as one of the many young Americans who received their final musical grooming in the masterclasses of Nadia Boulanger. Harris had no time for Boulanger&#x27;s neoclassical, Stravinsky-derived aesthetic, but under her tutelage he began his lifelong study of Renaissance music, and wrote his first significant work: the Concerto for Piano, Clarinet and String Quartet.

After suffering a serious back injury, Harris was obliged to return for treatment to the United States, where he formed associations with Howard Hanson at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and, more importantly, with Serge Koussevitsky at the Boston Symphony Orchestra. These associations secured performance outlets for the large-scale works he was writing. In 1934, a week after its first performance under Koussevitsky, his &quot;Symphony &#x27;1933&quot;&#x27; became the first American symphony to be commercially recorded. His work was also part of the music event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

It was his Symphony No. 3, however, first performed by Koussevitsky in 1939, which proved to be the composer&#x27;s biggest breakthrough and made him practically a household name.

During the 1930s Harris taught at Mills College, Westminster Choir College (1934–1938) and the Juilliard School of Music. He spent most of the rest of his professional career restlessly moving through teaching posts and residences at American colleges and universities. His final posts were in California, first at UCLA and then at California State University, Los Angeles. Among his pupils were William Schuman, H. Owen Reed, John Donald Robb, Robert Turner, Lorne Betts, George Lynn, John Verrall, Florence Price, Regina Hansen Willman, Peter Schickele (best known as the creator of P.D.Q. Bach) and Rudi Martinus van Dijk. He received many of America&#x27;s most prestigious cultural awards, and at the end of his life was proclaimed Honorary Composer Laureate of the State of California. 

In 1936 Harris married pianist Johana Harris (&quot;née&quot; Duffey), his junior by 14 years, who went on to a highly successful career, making numerous recordings and appearing as a soloist with almost every major American symphony orchestra. She also had a long career teaching on the piano faculty at the Juilliard School. Her name prior to their marriage was Beula Duffey, but Harris convinced her to change it to Johana after J.S. Bach. &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; states, &quot;Johana and Roy Harris were a &quot;tour de force&quot; in American music. Their collaboration has been compared to that of Robert and Clara Schumann. The Harrises organized concerts, adjudicated at festivals, and in 1959 founded the International String Congress. They promoted American folksong by including folksongs in their concerts and broadcasts.&quot; The couple had five children: Patricia, Shaun, Daniel, Maureen and Lane. Their two sons performed with The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, a Los Angeles-based psychedelic rock band of the late 1960s, and Roy Harris provided string arrangements on Shaun&#x27;s self-titled solo album in 1973.

Harris was among he founders of the Music Academy of the West summer conservatory in 1947.

== Character, reputation, and style characteristics ==
Harris was a champion of many causes. He founded the International String Congress to combat what was perceived as a shortage of string players in the U.S., and co-founded the American Composers Alliance. In 1958 the U.S. State Department sent him, along with some fellow composers including Peter Mennin and Roger Sessions, to the Soviet Union as a &quot;cultural ambassador&quot;; he was impressed by the support for composers that the Soviet state provided, not aware at the time of how carefully his visit was managed. He was a tireless organizer of conferences and contemporary music festivals and a frequent radio broadcaster. His last symphony, a commission for the American Bicentennial in 1976, was mauled by the critics at its first performance. This may have been due to its themes of slavery and the Civil War, which were in contrast to the celebratory mood of the country.

Although the rugged American patriotism of his works of the 1930s and 1940s is reflected in his research into and use of folk music (and to a lesser extent of jazz rhythms), Harris was paradoxically obsessed with the great European pre-classical forms, especially the fugue (which we hear in the Third Symphony) and passacaglia (as featured in the Seventh). His customary mode of musical discourse, with long singing lines and resonant modal harmonies, is ultimately based on his admiration for and development of Renaissance polyphony. He also used antiphonal effects, which he exploited brilliantly with a large orchestra. Like many American composers of his time, he was deeply impressed by the symphonic achievement of Sibelius. In Harris&#x27;s best works the music grows organically from the opening bars, as if a tiny seed gives birth to an entire tree. This is certainly the case with the Third Symphony, which joined the American repertoire during the same era as works by Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson. The first edition of Kent Kennan&#x27;s &quot;The Technique of Orchestration&quot; (1952) quotes three passages from this symphony to illustrate good orchestral writing for cello, timpani, and vibraphone, respectively. The book quotes no other Harris symphonies. Few other American symphonies have acquired such a position in the standard performance repertory as has this one, due in large part to the championing of the piece by Leonard Bernstein, who recorded it twice.

Though Harris&#x27;s symphonies are his greatest contribution to American music, he composed over 170 works, including many works for amateurs. His output includes works for band, orchestra, voice, chorus and chamber ensembles.

== The Symphonies ==

Harris composed at least 18 symphonies, though not all of them are numbered and not all are for orchestra. A full list is as follows:

* Symphony – Our Heritage (1925 rev. 1926, abandoned), sometimes referred to as Symphony No. 1 [for orchestra] – only an Andante survives
* Symphony – American Portrait (1928–29) [for orchestra]
* Symphony 1933 (1933), sometimes referred to as Symphony No. 1 [for orchestra]
* Symphony No. 2 (1934) [for orchestra]
* Symphony for Voices (1935) after Walt Whitman [for unaccompanied SATB chorus]
* Symphony No. 3 (1937–38, rev. 1939) [for orchestra]
* Folksong Symphony (Symphony No. 4) (1939 rev. 1942) [for chorus and orchestra]
* Symphony No. 5 (1940–42 rev. 1945) [for orchestra] — dedicated &quot;to the heroic and freedom-loving people of our great ally, the Union of Soviet Republics&quot;
* Symphony No. 6 &#x27;Gettysburg Address&#x27; after Lincoln (1943–44) [for orchestra]
* Symphony for Band &#x27;West Point&#x27; (1952) [for US military band]
* Symphony No. 7 (1951–52, rev. 1955) [for orchestra]

* Symphony No. 9 (1962) for Philadelphia [for orchestra]
* Symphony No. 10 &#x27;Abraham Lincoln&#x27; (1965) [for speaker, chorus, brass, 2 pianos and percussion]; revised version for speaker, chorus, piano and orchestra (1967; long thought missing, some string and woodwind parts found mis-filed in the library of the Youngstown Symphony, which premiered the orchestral version. Those parts donated to the Library of Congress.)
* Symphony No. 11 (1967) for New York PO 125th [for orchestra]
* Symphony No. 12 &#x27;Père Marquette&#x27; (1967–69) [for tenor solo, speaker and orchestra]
* Bicentennial Symphony 1776 (1969–74), numbered by Harris as Symphony No. 14 out of superstition over the number 13 but posthumously re-numbered as No. 13 by Dan Stehman with the permission of the composer&#x27;s widow [for six-part chorus and orchestra with solo voices and speakers]

In addition there is a missing (and perhaps not completed) Symphony for High School Orchestra (1937) and the following unfinished or fragmentary works:

* American Symphony (1938) [for jazz band]
* Choral Symphony (1936) [for chorus and orchestra]
* Walt Whitman Symphony (1955–58) [baritone solo, chorus and orchestra]

In 2006 Naxos Records launched a project to record the 13 numbered symphonies, mainly with conductor Marin Alsop. As of June 2018, they had released recordings of the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Symphonies. The recordings of the seventh and ninth symphonies are by the National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine under Theodore Kuchar. Symphony 1933 was recorded in 1987 by the Louisville Orchestra under the baton of Jorge Mester for their First Edition Recordings series. The same orchestra has also recorded and released his Fifth Symphony 22 years prior. The Albany Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of David Alan Miller, released their recording of Harris&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 (paired with Morton Gould&#x27;s Third Symphony) in 2002. Harris&#x27;s Eighth and Ninth Symphonies can be found on Albany Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s 1999 recording titled, &quot;The Great American Ninth&quot;.

<text>Māori culture () is the customs, cultural practices, and beliefs of the Māori people of New Zealand. It originated from, and is still part of, Eastern Polynesian culture. Māori culture forms a distinctive part of New Zealand culture and, due to a large diaspora and the incorporation of Māori motifs into popular culture, it is found throughout the world. Within Māoridom, and to a lesser extent throughout New Zealand as a whole, the word is often used as an approximate synonym for Māori culture, the Māori-language suffix being roughly equivalent to the qualitative noun-ending &quot;-ness&quot; in English. has also been translated as &quot;[a] Māori way of life.&quot; The term , meaning the guiding beliefs and principles which act as a base or foundation for behaviour, is also widely used to refer to Māori cultural values.

Four distinct but overlapping cultural eras have contributed historically to Māori culture:
* before Māori culture had differentiated itself from other Polynesian cultures (Archaic period)
* before widespread European contact (Classic period)
* the 19th century, in which Māori began interacting more intensively with European visitors and settlers
* the modern era since the beginning of the twentieth century

 in the modern era has been shaped by increasing urbanisation, closer contact with Pākehā (New Zealanders of European descent) and revival of traditional practices.

Traditional Māori arts play a large role in New Zealand art. They include (carving), (weaving), (group performance), (oratory), and (tattoo). The patterns and characters represented record the beliefs and genealogies () of Māori. Practitioners often follow the techniques of their ancestors, but in the 21st century Māoritanga also includes contemporary arts such as film, television, poetry and theatre.

The Māori language is known as , shortened to (literally, &quot;the language&quot;). At the beginning of the twentieth century, it seemed as if – as well as other aspects of Māori life – might disappear. In the 1980s, however, government-sponsored schools (Kura Kaupapa Māori) began to teach in , educating those with European as well as those with Māori ancestry.

Tikanga Māori is a set of cultural values, customs, and practices. This includes concepts such as what is sacred, caring for your community, rights to land by occupation, and other relationships between people and their environment. Tikanga differs from a western ethical or judicial systems because it is not administered by a central authority or an authoritative set of documents. It is a more fluid and dynamic set of practices and community accountability is &quot;the most effective mechanism for enforcing tikanga.&quot;

== History ==

Māori cultural history intertwines inextricably with the culture of Polynesia as a whole. The New Zealand archipelago forms the southwestern corner of the Polynesian Triangle, a major part of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: the Hawaiian Islands, Rapa Nui (Easter Island), and New Zealand (Aotearoa in te reo Māori). The many island cultures within the Polynesian Triangle share similar languages descended from a Proto-Polynesian language, which itself descends from a Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language used in southeastern Asia 5,000 years ago. Polynesians also share cultural traditions such as religion, social organisation, myths, and material culture. Anthropologists believe that all Polynesians descend from a South Pacific proto-culture developed by an Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) people who had migrated from southeastern Asia. (Other main Polynesian cultures include those of: Rapa Nui (now known as Easter Island), Hawaii, the Marquesas, Samoa, Tahiti, Tonga, and the Cook Islands.) Over the last five millennia, proto-Polynesians and their descendants performed a sequence of complicated and remarkable transoceanic treks in an unprecedented accomplishment of navigation and curiosity. The final ocean travel included long distances to Hawaii, Rapa Nui, and Aotearoa.

===Archaic period c. 1300 AD===

Researchers often label the time from about 1280 to about 1450 the Archaic period or &quot;Moa-hunter period&quot; – after the moa, the large flightless bird that formed a large part of the diet of the early Polynesian settlers. The immigrants brought many edible plants from their home islands in the central Pacific, and of these &quot;kūmara&quot; (sweet potato) would become the most important as the colder climate meant that tropical staple crops needed careful cultivation to survive, and some failed to grow locally. The became associated in several Polynesian
and Maori myth traditions with Rongomātāne (Rongo-mā-Tāne or Rongo) a high-ranking (god) in several Polynesian pantheons as the patron of agriculture/horticulture – and who had particular associations with sweet potatoes.

These early colonists explored New Zealand to find suitable stones for tool-making. The main stone-source areas included Mayor Island, Taupo and Kerikeri for obsidian (volcanic glass); prospectors soon found (greenstone or jade) and (argillite) resources in the South Island in the areas of present-day Reefton and Nelson. Basalt was later also found which is prospected to have a use in construction. Stone served in all aspects of Polynesian life: from chopping wood to cutting and slicing food, as anchors for (canoes) and for fishing nets, for retaining the heat in a , as drills using chert, and for stone clubs. These practices, well preserved at the Wairau Bar archeological site, were typical of East Polynesian culture at the same time.

Two Polynesian artefacts link early settlers to Polynesia. One, a turret shell only found in the South Pacific islands, most notably in the Society Islands, has been reworked into a small chisel found at Wairau Bar and dated to about 1300. The other is a 6 cm-long Polynesian pearl fishing-lure found at Tairua in 1962. This lure has been reliably dated to the early- to mid-14th century. It was found at a typical small coastal moa-hunters&#x27; site which has been interpreted as an itinerant hunting camp (). The discovery of Mayor Island obsidian on the Kermadec Islands, halfway between New Zealand and Tonga, strongly suggests that return journeys were made.

The new land also provided new opportunities: Māori learned to use local resources like pounamu, native timber, and the abundant birdlife, producing practical tools or food, as well as beautiful ornaments and items of clothing. This adaptation to the opportunities and challenges of the new environment led to the development of the Classic Māori culture.

=== Classic period c. 1500 AD ===

Māori artifacts began to change around the 15th century from an East Polynesian style to one more recognisably &quot;classic&quot; Māori, a style which persisted well into the contact period in the 18th and 19th centuries. At the same time, Māori groups became less nomadic, more settled in defined territories, and more dependent on gardening as a food source. Reliance on stored food such as kūmara tubers meant that stores needed to be protected from marauding neighbours. The widespread construction of large fortifications called on prominent hills and spurs dates from this time, as evidence of the development of a more martial, tribal culture. Not all aspects of this culture occurred universally, particularly in the South Island where kūmara could not be easily grown.

=== European colonisation from c. 1800 AD ===
Māori had encounters with European explorers from ships captained by Abel Tasman in 1642, James Cook three times between 1769 and 1777, Jean-François de Surville in 1769 and Marian du Fresne in 1772 which included violent encounters and also trade and exchange. Māori learnt of firearms during these encounters; it is believed the first firearms were acquired by Bay of Islands Māori around 1806.

After the European explorers, encounters at the turn of the century in Aotearoa were with whaling ships from America, France, Norway, Spain, and the British corporation the East India Company who visited regularly, setting conditions for a period of trade. Māori travelled overseas from the late 1790s with chiefs going to Sydney &#x27;in search of bartering opportunities&#x27;, and some working on various types of ships travelling to Britain, Australia and America. Small numbers of European whalers, sealers, traders, escaped convicts from Australia and runaway sailors established themselves especially in Northland and very south of New Zealand with the first Pākehā settlement at Doubtful Sound Patea in 1792. The first Christian missions clustered in the Bay of Islands: with Samuel Marsden, the senior Church of England chaplain in New South Wales fostering the foundation of the first mission station in Aotearoa in 1814–15.
Marsden&#x27;s party introduced horses and cattle.

With trade and travel Māori shifted to intensive horticulture and pastoral agriculture and as early as 1803 Maori were trading goods such as potatoes, pigs and maize. Māori invested in ploughs, mills, carts, and ships to transport their goods. The first Māori water-powered mill was built at Aotea, Raglan Harbour in 1846 and many more had been built by 1860.

Early industry by Māori was in part driven by the desire to trade for firearms. The Musket Wars (of 1807–1837) significantly altered intertribal conflict and there was seen a dramatic increase in casualties with many thousands of Māori people killed, some estimates over 60,000.

Populations of Māori to Europeans changed greatly during the 1800s. Henry Williams estimated in 1839 only a 1100 Europeans in the North Island, with 200 of them missionaries, and a total of about 500–600 Europeans in the Bay of Islands. The northern Māori population at the time has been estimated at 30,000 to 40,000, down from about 100,000 fifty years before. This drop in population was mostly due to the introduction of European diseases (measles and influenza) and to the Musket Wars. The Pākehā population doubled in the 1850s, surpassing the Māori population by the late 1860s, 1896 Māori population was about 40,000 and Pākehā was 700,000.

Alcohol was not present in Māori culture before European contact. Many Māori supported Henry Williams who opposed &quot;the activities of grog-sellers, gun-runners and other irreligious Europeans in the Bay of Islands&quot;. The mission at &quot;Paihia, directly opposite the notoriously lawless settlement of Kororāreka (later Russell), [was set up] to contrast Christianity with the decadent forms of European life&quot;.

European settlers brought their culture about sexuality and sexual violence to New Zealand. Sex within Māori culture was an open discussion, people chose their own sexual partners and &#x27;accepted that sex before marriage occurred&#x27;. In Māori society assault on a woman was a serious offence different to English laws. Before 1896 under English law the age of consent was 12 years old and incest was not considered a crime. European settlers had double standards of it being more acceptable for men to have sex outside of marriage, women were blamed for prostitution and rape was rarely prosecuted. The Victorian ethos that came with colonisation undermined the role of women in Māori society.

Many Māori started adopting the Christian faith from 1830s onwards, over time creating a uniquely Māori Christianity. Burial practices changed to incorporate aspects of Christianity. Bodies were usually buried in the ground by the mid-1840s, although sometimes coffins decorated with Māori motifs were used, suspended in trees or on poles as drawn by J. Polack. These were highly .

Slaves ( or ) were members of rival tribes who had been taken prisoner during warfare and were made to work on non- activities. The term was also used to denote something abhorrent and signifies the complete loss of of slaves. During the period of the Musket Wars the number of slaves taken as prisoners increased immensely and became an important part of some tribes&#x27; social structure.

Māori hapū of the north and Britain proclaimed the sovereign independence of New Zealand in 1835 with the signing of He Whakaputanga (The Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand). A follow-up to this was the Treaty of Waitangi that was first signed in 1840, in part that the Queen of England could control her &#x27;lawless subjects&#x27;. New Zealand was proclaimed a British colony in 1841, and the New Zealand Parliament was established in 1852. Māori had no representation in the early years (1854–1868) of the New Zealand Parliament. Votes for the members of Parliament required individual land-ownership so Māori were not able to vote as they owned land collectively. Ranginui Walker states that this &quot;institutionalisation of racism at the inception of democracy in New Zealand was the root cause of the conflict between Māori and Pākehā in the North Island and the colonial spoliation which followed&quot;.

Māori customs, rules and values, known as &quot;tikanga,&quot; were not recognised in parliament and there was an assumption that European values and traditions were superior. The &quot;judiciary simply denied that tikanga existed, the legislative suppressed aspects of tikanga, and together they altered the social structures of Māori in which tikanga existed, the overall effect being the social, economic, spiritual and political degradation of Māori society. To this day Māori society has still not recovered from this suppression of tikanga.&quot;

Land-ownership issues became some of the most transformative influences of the 19th century. In Māori culture collective ownership was the norm: Māori people hold a deep respect for, spiritual connection to, and responsibility for the land as &quot;tangata whenua&quot; (people of the land). As the government sought land for newly arriving immigrants, laws like the Native Lands Act 1865 changed the relationship Māori had with land. In 1870 Justice Minister Henry Sewell (in office 1870–1871) described the aims of the Native Land Court as &quot;to bring the great bulk of the lands in the Northern Island [...] within the reach of colonisation&quot; and &quot;the detribalisation of the Māori – to destroy, if it were possible, the principle of communism upon which their social system is based and which stands as a barrier in the way of all attempts to amalgamate the Māori race into our social and political system.&quot; By the end of the 19th century these goals were largely met – to the detriment of Māori culture.

===Marginalisation and renaissance c. 1900 AD to today===

Māori continued to experience significant cultural change into the next century.

In 1900 few Māori lived in European urban settlements, in 1926 there were 16% of Māori populations in urban centres, during World War II there was a shift and in 1945 it changed to 26% and it increased over the 1950s and 60s, so by 1966 it was 62%.

During the 1930s and 1940s, MP Āpirana Ngata had passed land legislation to help Māori make better use of their remaining tribal land. Māori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much Māori land was steep, remote, erosion-prone with high rainfall. European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanised to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. Māori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans. Leasing land to European farmers gave Māori a steady income but this was spread among many people. Māori farming was often based on a different system of values and not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.

Apart from jobs, another attraction to urban migration were the monetary, recreational and lifestyle attractions of the city. Many Māori felt that success lay in the city rather than the country. King describes this as a &quot;fantasy contagion-the realty did not live up to the myth but this did not stop the fantasy or the migration&quot;.
Other changes were a rising birth rate. In 1955, the Māori birth rate was nearly double the European rate at 43.6 compared to 26 per 1000. At the same time, Māori had fewer qualifications. In 1956 6.5% of Māori held professional, managerial or clerical jobs compared to 26.7% non-Māori. As a result, only 3.36% of Māori earned 700 pounds or more per annum compared to 18.6% for non-Māori. Māori were significantly impacted by changing economic circumstances such as the drop in wool prices. This made Māori more vulnerable to economic and social deprivation. King says that the lower Māori educational attainment lead to lower income jobs, which led to lower income, poor housing, and poor health, which in turn led to higher rates of crime.

These ingredients were potential causes of racial tension. They were seen by the wider community as &quot;Māori problems&quot;. By the 1970s and 1980s, enough urbanised Māori had reached positions of influence to bring about a gradual but radical change to the thinking of governments. Their advocacy was underscored by an increasing willingness to use vigorous protest to push Mana Māori. Young urban radicals beat up a group of university students taking a comical view of Māori dance. Protestors occupied Bastion Point which was claimed as Māori land and resisted police arrest. In Raglan local Māori protesters reclaimed ownership of land used as an airstrip and golf course.

From the early 1970s a new generation of radicals arose demanding more Māori influence. Amongst the demands were for increased . The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of &quot;chieftainship&quot;. However, the term was often used by Māori to express the idea of political rights for all Māori, not just the class, or the idea of Māori sovereignty or Māori independence.

Educated urban Māori advocated the teaching of Māori language and the inclusion of a Māori point of view in all aspects of education. Māori began to express their ideas in new political movements with Māori voters switching from supporting the Labour party to alternatives such as the Māori led New Zealand First party in 1992. The introduction of MMP (Mixed Member Proportional) elections in 1996 had the effect of giving minority groups of any shades, more influence. The 1996 election produced 14 Māori MPs with 3 in the cabinet. Māori MP Winston Peters, was the deputy Prime minister.

This position set high expectations for positive results from the Treaty of Waitangi Tribunal which was set up to investigate Māori grievances against historical New Zealand governments in relation to the treaty. From the early 1990s a series of favourable outcomes from the treaty tribunal resulted in a large flow of capital in the form of land, primary resources and cash from the government to various Māori iwi (tribe or nation) and hapū (subtribe or clan). A key concept was the continued occupation of an area of land (Ahi kaa). The largest tribal deals approached $1 billion although many were far smaller. This gave and organisations a source of financial security they had not had previously. To 2013 the total paid by government exceeds $4 billion. These resulted in a more cohesive tribal organisation as all assets went to tribal or hapū organisations. In 2012 it was estimated that the total value of Māori-controlled assets was about $400 billion. , 70 settlements have reached the stage of being passed into legislation, with a further 45 settlements in various stages of negotiation.

==Cultural concepts==
Some of the fundamental cultural concepts of are present throughout Polynesia, but all have been altered by New Zealand&#x27;s unique history and environment.

=== (worldview) ===
 is a term widely used to refer to Māori worldview, as expressed through its many cultures and traditions. It differs from &quot;Māoritanga&quot; as much in mindset as in anything more concrete: Whereas &quot;Māoritanga&quot; is used to refer to aspects of Māori culture, &quot;Te Ao Māori&quot; encompasses the concept of living immersively within the bounds of Māori spiritual and cultural tradition and viewing the world from that standpoint.

=== (power and prestige) ===
 is a cultural concept of the Māori, meaning a sacred power or authority. Mana is sacred power bestowed by the gods on the ancestral lineage of chiefs, or . While the itself is a supernatural gift, the chief is free to waste or magnify it. Historian Judith Binney says that maintaining and increasing the of and and loyalty within the group is unquestionably at the heart of Māori cultural concepts. She says that Māori cultural history is confusing to the uninformed as it consists of narrative-myths that stretch far back in time. Also confusing is that chronological time is irrelevant or distorted to the Māori cultural story, so a person living in the present may narrate a story about their family or hapū that happened centuries ago; nonetheless, the narrator appears as a contemporary figure in the myth.

A key element of cultural leadership is to link the narrator to a well known historical figure with mana (prestige/authority power).

=== (genealogy) ===
 is the origin and path of descent of a person, object or geographic area. A person&#x27;s establishes their mana and tribal connections. It can be recited as an introduction ().

Another form of introductory recital is the , a personal introduction which lists a person&#x27;s connection with iwi and with natural landmarks such as rivers and mountains.

=== (balance and harmony) ===
 is often associated with the word &#x27;revenge&#x27;. However, in a broader sense, is meant as the preservation of balance and harmony within a civilisation. In the concept of , a fault must always be corrected and a kindness repaid. However, the means by which this is accomplished may vary greatly by case. In the context of a gift exchange, creates and preserves social connections and commitments. recovers balance in the event that social relations are interrupted.

, a form of , is a process of restorative justice typically between hapū and whānau groups, where acts of compensation for wrongdoing, usually physical items or resources, are given to the wronged party as a way to restore societal balance. differs from , as once the (ceremonial judicial process) has been completed and the compensation is made, no further acts or requirements are necessary, and the balance between the two parties has been restored.

Gift exchange was governed by three basic principles. First, giving had to have the appearance of being free and spontaneous, without stipulation of a return present. Second, a strict system of obligation was in force whereby the receiver was bound to not only reciprocate but to increase the value of the reciprocated gift. Third, the system demanded that further social obligation had now been established to continue the exchanges. Failure to respond meant loss of mana or influence. Where parties had travelled a long way to give a present it was expected that the return gift be immediate but often due to seasonal food supplies it was accepted that a return gift would be given at some later date when supplies allowed. While a gift conveyed an obligation to return the favour, so did an insult. The response might be a martial one. Historian Angela Ballara describes warfare as a &quot;learned, culturally determined [response] to offences against the rules of Māori society.&quot;

=== (guardianship) ===

 (from &quot;guardian&quot;) means guardianship or protection and in modern usage relates mostly to the protection of the natural environment.

=== (forbidden and sacred) ===
 is similar to – both Māori concepts have parallels in wider Polynesian culture. Together, and are seen as keeping the harmony of things. sustains structure and social order. It can be seen as a legal or religious concept, that is centred on the idea of being &quot;forbidden&quot; and &quot;sacred&quot;. When a person, place, or thing is considered to be , it is often distinguished as something in high value and importance, being set aside by the gods. The social mores and divine origins associated with led Elsdon Best to detect the evolution of &quot;a somewhat theocratic form of government&quot; among pre-contact Māori.

=== (tribal elders) ===
 (or sometimes for women) are respected tribal elders of either gender in a Māori community who have been involved with their for a number of years. They are appointed by their people who believe the chosen elders have the capacity to teach and guide both current and future generations. It is against the rules of mana for anyone to self-proclaim their elder status, instead, the people acknowledge an elder&#x27;s status. In the past, were believed to be &quot;the reincarnation of a person who had acquired a supernatural or godly status after death, and who had become the protector of the family&quot;.
=== (gifts)===
 are gifts to the hosts, often of food or traditional items, though money is most commonly used today. Traditionally, the essence of is that it is voluntary and comes from the heart, so to specify the amount is contrary to its spirit. Increasingly, it is common for the to be a fixed sum per head that is communicated to the guests in private, so there is no embarrassment. Recipients rely on the donors&#x27; (empathy), (cherishing) and (spirit) to ensure that it is enough. Thanks for are accordingly warm.

=== (New Year)===
, &quot;Māori New Year&quot;, celebrates the first rising of the Pleiades in late May or early June. Traditionally the actual time for the celebration of varies, with some celebrating it immediately, others waiting until the rising of the next full moon. It is a day where they pay respect to the people they have lost but also gain over the last year that has passed. They celebrate the day and night with prayers, feasting, singing and music. After lapsing for many years it is now becoming more widely celebrated in a range of ways and over the period of a week or month anywhere from early June to late July.
== Arts, entertainment and media ==
The national annual awards for &quot;toi Māori&quot;, Māori arts, the Te Waka Toi awards define two areas of arts, marae arts (traditional, marae-based art forms for example carving and weaving) and contemporary art forms (for example theatre, literature, film, photography, sculpture and visual arts). The Kiingi Tuheitia Portraiture Award is a contemporary art award and exhibition that encourages emerging Māori artists to create portraits of their ancestors, it accepts all forms of visual arts with an uku (clay) artist winning in 2023.

=== Carving () ===

 or just is the Māori traditional art of carving in wood, stone or bone. Some surviving , or carvings, are over 500 years old. Wood carvings were used to decorate houses, fence-poles, containers, , tool handles, and other objects. Large-scale stone-face carvings were sometimes created. The most popular type of stone used in carving was (greenstone), a form of jade, but other kinds were also used, especially in the North Island, where was not widely available. Bone was used for delicate items such as fish-hooks and needles. Both stone and bone were used to create jewellery such as the . The introduction of metal tools by Europeans allowed more intricacy and delicacy.

Carving is a art.

The Māori Arts and Crafts Institute at Whakarewarewa in Rotorua is a stronghold of traditional carving skills. The institute was initiated by political leader Āpirana Ngata who wanted to rejuvenate Māori culture and saw the arts as a vital part of that. Ngata through this process endorsed certain patterns as being &#x27;Māori art&#x27; which excluded some patterns.

Hōne Taiapa was head of this school for some time. Since the Māori Renaissance there has been a resurgence of interest in , alongside other traditional Māori practices, with a much greater integration with mainstream contemporary art. The Māori Art Market (funded by the state-sponsored Toi Māori Aotearoa) is a significant venue for the promotion and sale of .

Notable carvers include 
* Eramiha Neke Kapua (1867–1955)
* Piri Poutapu (1905–1975)
* Hōri Pukehika ()
* Raharuhi Rukupo ()
* Hōne Taiapa (1911–1979)
* Pine Taiapa (1901–1972)
* Inia Te Wiata (1915–1971)
* Tene Waitere (1853–1931)

Te Papa and Auckland Art Gallery have substantial holdings of , with Te Papa in particular having many digitised in their &quot;Collections online&quot; website.

=== Tattooing () ===

 is the traditional Māori art of tattooing the skin; a is an instance of the art. Prior to colonisation, most high-ranking persons received as an important milestone between childhood and adulthood, and those who went without them were perceived to have lower social status. The art was a sacred activity accompanied by many rites and rituals. Men generally received on their faces, buttocks and thighs; women wear on their lips and chins. The facial form gives details of the wearer&#x27;s lineage, status, and origin.

Historically, combined tattooing with scarification, in that the skin was carved with (chisels), not punctured. This left the skin with grooves rather than a smooth surface. were made from albatross bone and hafted to a handle. Pigments were made from the for the body colour, and (burnt timbers) for the blacker face colour. The soot from burnt kauri gum was also mixed with fat to make pigment. In the late 19th century were gradually replaced with needles, and became smooth tattoos instead of textured scars.

Since 1990 there has been a resurgence in the practice of for both men and women, as a sign of cultural identity and a reflection of the general revival of Māori language and culture. Most applied today is done using a tattoo machine, but there has also been a revival of the use of .

=== Painting ===

Charcoal drawings can be found on limestone rock shelters in the centre of the South Island, with over 500 sites stretching from Kaikōura to North Otago. The drawings are estimated to be between 500 and 800 years old, and portray animals, humans and legendary creatures, possibly stylised reptiles. Some of the birds pictured are extinct, including moa and Haast&#x27;s eagles. They were drawn by early Māori, but by the time Europeans arrived, local inhabitants did not know the origins of the drawings.

Although the oldest forms of Māori art are Archaic rock paintings, painting was not a major art form in the Classical period. It was mainly used to produce decorative panels in (meeting houses), in stylised forms known as . Europeans introduced Māori to their more figurative style of art, and in the 19th century less stylised depictions of people and plants began to appear on walls in place of traditional carvings and woven panels. The introduction of European paints also allowed traditional painting to flourish, as brighter and more distinct colours could be produced.

With the resurgence of Māori culture in the public sphere from the 1970s onwards came a new emphasis on painting, alongside the more traditional Māori visual art forms, as a means of asserting Māori identity and beliefs. Contemporary and recent Māori painters include Ralph Hotere (1931–2013), Shane Cotton (born 1964), Marilynn Webb (1937–2021), and Mary Wirepa (1904–1971).

=== The motif ===

The is a spiral shape resembling a new unfurling silver fern frond. It is an integral symbol used in , , and painting, where it symbolises new life, growth, strength and peace. Its shape &quot;conveys the idea of perpetual movement,&quot; while the inner coil &quot;suggests returning to the point of origin&quot;.

The is the integral motif of the symbolic and seemingly abstract designs traditionally used to decorate . There are numerous semi-formal designs, representing different features of the natural world.

The logo of Air New Zealand incorporates a design—based on the Ngaru (Ngāti Kahungunu) pattern—as a symbol of the flora of New Zealand. The logo was introduced in 1973 to coincide with the arrival of the airline&#x27;s first McDonnell Douglas DC-10 wide-body jet.
=== Weaving () and traditional clothing ===
Māori prior to European colonisation wore woven garments for protection from the weather and to denote social status. There were two main types of garments: a knee-length kilt or grass skirt worn around the waist and secured by a belt, and a rectangular cape or cloak worn over the shoulders. (cloaks) in particular were symbols of high rank.

Textiles were made from a number of plants, including (New Zealand flax), , , , , and . The paper mulberry was introduced from the tropical Pacific by Māori, who knew it as , but it failed to flourish in New Zealand&#x27;s cooler climate, and (bark cloth) was rare. (cloaks woven from strips of dog-skin rather than plant fibres) were rare and highly prized.

Raw flax leaves were split and woven into mats, ropes and nets, but the basis of most clothing was (prepared flax fibre). This was stripped from the leaves using a mussel shell, softened by soaking and pounding with (stone pestles), and spun by rolling the thread against the leg. Colours for dyeing were sourced from indigenous materials.

The (weaving) process for clothing was performed not with a loom and shuttle but with the warp threads being twined downward by hand from a strong thread held taut between two or four upright (weaving sticks). A variety of techniques were used for fine clothing. The technique known as is a Māori innovation, producing intricate geometric designs in many colours for belts and cloak borders.

Little of the human body had to be concealed for modesty&#x27;s sake. In informal settings, men went naked except for a belt with a piece of string attached holding their foreskin shut over their glans penis. Women covered their pubic area with small aprons or bunches of fragrant plant material when in the presence of men – although these parts could be exposed in (a gesture of contempt). Pre-pubescent children wore no clothes at all. There was no shame or modesty attached to women&#x27;s breasts, and therefore no garments devoted to concealing them; the ( bodices) now worn in performances became standard costume only in the 1950s. The European colonists regarded nudity as obscene, and cited it as a sign of Māori racial inferiority (calling them &quot;naked savages&quot;).
Compared with European clothing, traditional garments took a long time to make and did not offer much protection or warmth. From the early sealing days, Māori working in sealing camps in the South Island adopted European clothing, which soon became widely available from itinerant peddlers. Blankets were in high demand and were often worn as kilts, cloaks, or shawls. Since the end of the 19th century, traditional clothing is only used on ceremonial occasions.


=== Music () and dance () ===

 ( groups) often come together to practice and perform cultural items such as or songs, especially action songs, and for entertainment. dances may also form part of the repertoire. Traditional instruments sometime accompany the group, though the guitar is also commonly used. Many New Zealand schools now have a as part of the Māori studies curriculum. Today, national competitions are held where groups are judged to find the best performers; these draw large crowds. The common expression &quot;&quot; is, strictly speaking, a tautology.

The – an action chant, often described as a &quot;war dance&quot;, but more a chant with hand gestures and foot stomping, originally performed by warriors before a battle, proclaiming their strength and prowess by way of abusing the opposition. Now, this procedure is regularly performed by New Zealand representatives of rugby and rugby league teams before a game begins. There are many different ; though, one, &quot;&quot; by Te Rauparaha, is much more widely known than any other.

=== Māori literature ===

The novels of Witi Ihimaera and the short stories of Patricia Grace provide an insider&#x27;s view of the culture. &quot;The Bone People&quot; a novel by Keri Hulme, won the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1985. Jacqueline Sturm was the first Māori woman to complete an undergraduate university degree, at Victoria University College, followed by an MA in Philosophy. Sidney Moko Mead wrote &quot;: Living by Māori Values&quot;, which provides a thorough introduction about the Māori way of doing things, both in the past and present.

==== Māori newspapers () ====
Māori were quick to learn the power of the printed word. The first Māori newspaper appeared in 1842. A number of different newspapers such as &#x27; and &#x27; were written in the Māori language to convey information to a widespread Māori audience, often of a political or ideological nature. Although print runs were often small it was common for a newspaper to be passed around a whole . Although the government printed newspapers in Māori such as &quot;&quot;, the movement was anxious to convey their own message to Māori. Whereas the government and missionaries often used their newspapers as an educational tool – to inform Māori of British laws and customs – the countered this with arguments for self-determination. Māori newspapers eagerly reported on events from overseas that showed groups such as the Irish challenging British sovereignty to obtain home rule.

=== Film and broadcasting ===

Selected films that feature Māori themes and culture include:
*&quot;The Betrayer&quot;, 1921 Australian-New Zealand film about an inter-racial romance.
*&quot;The Te Kooti Trail&quot; a documdrama released in 1927 about Te Kooti&#x27;s War
* &quot;, 1983, loosely based on events from Te Kooti&#x27;s War
* &quot;, 1987, set in 1948, looking at the threat of unemployment for a local Māori community.
* &quot;, 1988.
* &quot;, 1991, explored the links between Māori political activism, cultural identity and spiritual redemption.
* &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, 1994, graphic depiction of urban Māori and domestic violence, and its 2001 sequel, &quot;What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?&quot;
* &quot;Whale Rider&quot;, 2002 by Niki Caro, a 12-year-old girl&#x27;s struggles for chiefly succession

* &quot;The Dead Lands&quot;, 2014, an action/fighting movie set prior to European contact

Well-known Māori actors include Temuera Morrison, Cliff Curtis, Lawrence Makoare, Manu Bennett, and Keisha Castle-Hughes. They appear in films such as &quot;Whale Rider&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;River Queen&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Rapa Nui&quot;, and others, and famous television series like &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Lost World&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In most cases their roles in Hollywood productions have them portraying ethnic groups other than Māori.

In the 2010s Māori actor-director Taika Waititi rose to global fame with the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;&quot; (in which he played an alien named Korg), which many critics noted carried a sophisticated commentary on colonisation under the comedy. Waititi went on to win an Academy Award, which he dedicated &quot;to the indigenous kids of the world&quot;, for the screenplay of his anti-hate satire &quot;Jojo Rabbit&quot;, in which he played Adolf Hitler as imagined by a ten-year-old Hitler Youth member. His previous films include &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&quot;, both of which feature young Māori protagonists.

Māori Television is a New Zealand TV station broadcasting programmes that tries to make a significant contribution to the revitalisation of and . Funded by the New Zealand Government, the station started broadcasting on 28 March 2004 from a base in Newmarket.

Te Reo is the station&#x27;s second channel, launched 28 March 2008. Te Reo is presented in 100% Māori language with no advertising or subtitles. It features special tribal programming with a particular focus on new programming for the fluent audience.

=== Sport ===

 and are two sports of Māori origin. got an unexpected boost when McDonald&#x27;s chose it to represent New Zealand. Canoe racing (waka ama) was a traditional sport that continued alongside new sports introduced by European migrants.

Māori were present in New Zealand&#x27;s sporting culture since introduced sports of the nineteenth century such as cricket, running, rugby and horse racing and this has continued. Popular sports in New Zealand include rugby league and rugby union with teams the All Blacks, Black Ferns, Kiwis and Kiwi Ferns featuring many Māori players, George Nēpia Ruby Tui and Stacey Jones are some of the well-known names. Other sports in New Zealand also feature notable Māori and in 2021 canoeist Lisa Carrington was named the most influential Māori sportsperson of the past 30 years. There are also national Māori rugby union, rugby league and cricket teams, which play in international competitions, separate from the main national ones.

== (community meeting place)==


A is a communal meeting facility that is the place for much Māori community and cultural life. It is also a concept bigger than buildings as described by Peter Tapsell involving people and values. At the meetings and ceremonies take place in accordance with traditional protocols. The generally consists of an open cleared area in front of a large carved meeting house often called a &quot;wharenui&quot;, along with a dining hall and other facilities. Functions and events that occur on the include meetings, celebrations, weddings, christenings, reunions, and (funerals).

A meeting on a marae often begins with a (a welcoming ceremony). The is structured and starts with the visitors waiting at the gate or entrance and forming group. It includes speeches following a traditional format, their sequence dictated by the (protocol) of that place, and followed by , songs. It is appreciated if guests can say a few words in Māori and sing a song they are familiar with as a group.

Detail of protocols, called &quot; or &quot;, vary by but in all cases locals and visitors have to respect certain rules especially during the rituals of encounter. When a group of people come to stay on a , they are considered (guests) while the hosts of the are known as (&quot;people of the land&quot;).

Sharing of food is an important part of a . The traditional is often cooked for large groups at a , with communal preparation by the host group.

An important event at are (funeral). or &quot;tangi&quot; are the means by which the dead are farewelled and the surviving family members supported in Māori society. As indicated by Ka&#x27;ai and Higgins, &quot;the importance of the and its central place in custom is reflected in the fact that it takes precedence over any other gathering on the &quot;. It almost always takes place on the home of the deceased. It is normal for Māori to travel very long distances to attend a . The of the deceased sit by the coffin on porch or in the porch. A may go on for several days, especially for a person of great .

=== oral tradition ===
The history of individual tribal groups is kept by means of narratives, songs and chants, hence the importance of music, story and poetry. Oratory, the making of speeches, is especially important in the rituals of encounter, and it is regarded as important for a speaker to include allusions to traditional narrative and to a complex system of proverbial sayings, called . Oral traditions include songs, calls, chants, and formalised speech patterns that recall the history of the people.

=== Other traditional buildings ===
The standard building in a classic Māori settlement was a simple sleeping (house/hut) about 2 metres x 3 metres with a low roof, an earth floor, no window and a single low doorway. Heating was provided by a small open fire in winter. There was no chimney.

Material used in construction varied between areas, but raupō reeds, flax and totara bark shingles for the roof were common. Similar small , but with interior drains, were used to store kūmara on sloping racks.

In the classic period a higher proportion of were located inside than was the case after contact with Europeans. A chief&#x27;s was similar but larger – often with full headroom in the centre, a small window and a partly enclosed front porch. In times of conflict the chief lived in a on the or summit of a hill . In colder areas, such as in the North Island central plateau, it was common for to be partly sunk into the ground for better insulation.

Food was not cooked in the sleeping but in the open or under a (lean-to). Saplings with branches and foliage removed were used to store and dry items such as fishing nets or cloaks. Valuable items were stored in pole-mounted storage shelters called . Other constructions were large racks for drying split fish.

During the construction of important buildings, slaves were sometimes used as a sacrifice. This practice was done in order to express the buildings&#x27; significance and to secure the gods&#x27; protection. For smaller buildings, small animals were sacrificed to distinguish it from other buildings and to exhibit its uniqueness.

The traditional Māori continued to be used in rural areas in particular well into the post-contact period. They were usually very small with a dirt floor and full of vermin, especially fleas. In winter a central fire was lit that filled the with smoke which slowly filtered through the roof. Even as late as 1849 George Cooper, the assistant private secretary to George Grey, described a village in the relatively affluent lower Eastern Waihou River area as &quot;a wretched place, containing about a dozen miserable raupo huts all tumbling to pieces&quot;. 11. In the 19th century settlements were -based, and 5 buildings became standardised: the sleeping , or communal cookhouse/shelter, or wood store, or storehouse, and increasingly from the 1870s or community meeting house. Significant finance and was invested in increasingly elaborate meeting houses which became a source of or pride and prestige.

A meeting house was likely to have outside carvings and increasingly as European tools were used, intricate interior carving and woven panels depicting tribal history. Rotorua became a centre of carving excellence under the encouragement of the Māori MPs in the Young Māori party. Itinerant specialist carvers travelled widely, employing their skills in many locations. Meetinghouses became places for tribal celebrations or political meetings, especially after the 1860s Land Wars. They were a place to display largesse and enhance with elaborate feasts and entertainment. By the 20th century were common and averaged 18–24m long by 8m wide. There were no Māori buildings of this size in pre-European days. As Māori became familiar with European building construction and design they incorporated features such as chimneys and fireplaces and made use of bigger doorways and windows as well as sawn timber but even by the turn of the 19th century toilet facilities were often primitive, despite the urgings of the Māori MPs Māui Pōmare and Āpirana Ngata who worked hard to improve the standard of Māori dwellings over their many years in office.

== Mythology and religion ==
Traditional Māori religion, has deviated little from its tropical Eastern Polynesian roots on the island of Hawaiki Nui. Accordingly, all things were thought of as possessing a life force or . The god Tangaroa was the personification of the ocean and the ancestor or origin of all fish; Tāne was the personification of the forest and the origin of all birds; and Rongo was the personification of peaceful activities and agriculture and the ancestor of cultivated plants. (According to some, the supreme personification of the Māori was Io; however this idea is controversial.)

Christianity plays an important role in Māori religion today. In the early 19th century, many Māori embraced Christianity and its concepts. Large numbers of converts joined the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church, both of which are still highly influential in Māori society.

=== Health and traditional beliefs ===
Classic Māori viewed disease as a punishment for breaking tribal , but recognised that some families were prone to a certain disease. The standard practice of was to isolate the victim in a small shelter. The most common serious disease was tuberculosis (), which was present in the colonising Polynesians. Classic Māori did not recognise the symptoms as being from one disease. was considered the work of demons and caused by (witchcraft). was the name of the devil that caused tubercular bone disease. Tuberculosis of the neck glands was called or . This was very common. Tubercular ulcers were called . The early European explorer and painter Earle noted in 1827 that these diseases were common even in isolated inland districts such as Taupo. His Māori advisers said the diseases were very old.

Earle recognised that used a range of plants to treat minor skin ailments. Much later European doctors advocated investigation of the medicinal properties of plants commonly used in Māori medicine.

===Missionaries===

Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionaries insisted Māori abandon cannibalism and child infanticide before they could be baptised. They tried to discourage polygamy. Some early missionaries had sympathy for abandoned wives but Henry Williams was adamant that polygamy disqualified Māori from baptism. CMS missionaries also outlawed the use of further , taking part in lewd dances and practising customary funeral rites. Catholic missionaries who arrived 20 years after the Church of England CMS missionaries were less concerned with stopping these customary practices before Christian conversion. They reasoned that they could influence Māori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western Hokianga district, away from the dominant CMS influence.

Missionaries did not arrive in the Waikato until about 1834–5. CMS Mission Stations were established at Manakau, Maraetai, Waikato Heads, Kaitotehe opposite Tuapiri, Te Awamutu, Kopua and Kawhia. Missionaries helped explain the Treaty of Waitangi to Tainui in 1840.

=== First Māori interpretation of Christianity ===
In the 1830s Te Atua Wera started the Papahurihia Faith in opposition to the missionaries. It mixed Christian, Judaic and Māori customary influences. They held services on Saturday and called themselves or Jews. Te Atua Wera reverted to the more customary role of a figure by the late 1830s. Te Atua Wera taught that heaven was a place where there was happiness, no cold or hunger with an abundance of flour, sugar, muskets, ships, murder and voluptuousness.

== Children and education ==
=== Childhood ===
Early European reports suggest that Māori children were indulged and led a carefree and playful life. A French explorer in 1772 commented that &quot;[the women] seemed to be good mothers and showed affection for their offspring. I have often seen them play with the children, caress them, chew the fern-root, pick at the stringy parts, and then take it out of their mouth to put it into that of their nurslings. The men were also very fond of and kind to their children.&quot; French missionary Jean-Simon Bernard wrote, disapprovingly, in 1844: &quot;The children here are completely free; the parents never do anything to them. They never beat them and do not allow anyone else to beat them.&quot; The killing of children could be a (cause) of war. Circa 1812 the north-Taranaki Ngāti Tama killed two Ngāti Maniapoto boys during a visit to friends at Motuawa near the Mokau heads.
This led to a Ngāti Maniapoto reprisal raid about three years later when warriors pretended to be peaceful visitors and launched a surprise attack on Ngāti Tama.

The concept of (adopting or fostering children) has been, and still is, important within Māori . It is the practice of raising nieces, nephews, cousins and other wider-family members as if they were members of the immediate family. are adopted children who are raised with a , most often as another member of that , like a brother or sister.

Historian Paul Moon writes of missionaries reporting how families forced some of their young girls into the sex trade with the object of obtaining valuable and scarce English goods in the 1820s. He describes how, when a new ship arrived, the fathers came to take girls as young as 10 out of school. Moon records reports of widespread infanticide in Māori settlements—particularly the killing of baby girls, of slaves captured in battle or of half-caste children. Other historians such as Vincent O&#x27;Malley demonstrate that reports of this type are contradictory and often unreliable. Sam Ritchie points out that Moon fails to contextualize his interpretation of missionary writing and accepts it at face value without adequately considering other sources or the reasons behind such reports. Census figures in the 19th century showed a marked male/female imbalance throughout the North Island amongst Māori children. The 1857–8 Māori census recorded 32,329 males and only 23,928 females.

In modern times, child abuse among Māori has received a great deal of media attention. From 1978 to 1987 the Māori child-homicide rate was 1.15 times the non-Māori rate. However, between 1991 and 2000, the Māori rate rose to more than 3.5 times the non-Māori rate and from 2001 to 2005 the Māori child-homicide rate reduced to 2.4 times that of non-Māori. As part of a response to these statistics, national Māori child-advocacy organisation Te Kāhui Mana Ririki formed in 2008. Te Kāhui Mana Ririki has commissioned research into traditional Māori parenting in order to tackle child abuse in the Māori community.

===Education===

According to oral information Māori were familiar with the concept of schooling in tradition times as taught by . Bishop Selwyn took adult Māori to Sydney where they experienced limited schooling to learn English. When missionaries back in arrived in the Bay of Islands they realised that if they were going to introduce Christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism, slavery, lewd dancing and having multiple wives, they would need to establish schools. Both the missionaries and their wives constructed schools and provided slates and bibles as reading material. The first school was established by T. Kendal in 1816. Recently original slates and written material from that period in the Bay of Islands has been located, photographed and published. Some adults attended school but most pupils were the sons or daughter of chiefs or other persons of status.

By 1853 Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a mission school at Taupiri in the Waikato for 50 Māori girls for 3 years. The girls learnt arithmetic and reading. In the early 1860s Governor Grey had provided money to support a trade school near Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The aim was to produce Māori workers who were literate but could also work with, and repair, agricultural machinery as used on farms and in the new flour mills. In 1863 Rewi Maniapoto attacked and burnt down the school, stealing the printing press. He aimed to kill leading Europeans in the area but they had been warned by friendly Māori and left before the attack. Because of the negative influence of Maniapoto and other anti-government factions, the school had previously had poor attendance, with as few as 10 boys attending regularly. All teaching by missionaries was in Māori and this continued in the native schools until 1900 when at the insistence of the Young Māori Party Māori MPs, schools started teaching in English. Influential Māori MPs Ngata and Pōmare insisted that Māori be taught modern ways and sponsored the Suppression of Tohungaism Act in parliament. Pōmare, in particular, worked hard to banish ancient Māori concepts and practices that caused harm in the Māori community.

== Food ==


=== Traditional Māori foods ===
Eating shellfish such as mussels and oysters was very common. During summer sea fish such as kahawai were caught using bone or hooks, 2-piece lures or large flax nets. In creeks and lakes, eels were caught in large numbers when migrating along known waterways using , a long cone-shaped net. Birds such as ducks were targeted during the moulting season and young birds such as Petrels and Gannets were taken from nests and cooked in their own fat to preserve them. Such preserved birds were favourite gifts to fulfil social gift obligations. Māori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Native pigeons ate miro berries which made them thirsty. Māori carved wooden bowls equipped with multiple neck snares and placed these in miro trees to catch these large birds.

Evidence from many recent Eastern Golden Bay excavations, especially at Tata Beach, shows that in middens local shellfish and fish bones were most prominent, followed by dog () bones and rat bones. Less common were bones from small birds and sea mammals. The Tata Beach site and other nearby sites such as Takapou were in use from 1450 up to 1660 AD, well into the Classic period. The coastal sites showed that Māori had created man-made soils in the sand dunes ranging from small to very large (over 100m2). The natural soil A horizons had been modified by placing dark, humus-rich soil near the surface. This practice was widespread in Māori communities where kūmara was grown, although in many cases free-draining sand, gravels and pumice were mixed with humus-rich loam. Kūmara are slow-growing in the temperate NZ climate and need free-draining subsoils. In the Eastern Golden Bay north-facing slopes were favoured.

The warmer climate of the north and northern and central coastal regions allowed better growth of subtropical plants such as kūmara, yam and gourds. In Auckland, and on Mayor Island, volcanic land was cleared of rocks which were used for low shelter walls. In some areas piles of volcanic rock which kept warm at night, were used to train the vines of gourds.

Many special techniques had been devised to grow and especially to store kūmara so it did not rot. Careful storage and use of was essential to prevent unauthorised use. Seed kūmara in particular were highly . The main problem for kūmara growers were native caterpillars. Early European explorers reported that Māori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars. Māori continued to use traditional fern roots——as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century.

=== Introduced foods ===
The introduction of European foods changed many aspects of Māori agriculture. Under tradition, Māori agriculture land was abandoned after a few crops because of reduced production. This was the common pattern apart from a few very fertile alluvial river valleys. Fertiliser was not used although Māori had devised various techniques to enhance production such as the addition of pumice or similar materials to improve drainage on heavy soils. Māori allowed gardens to revert to shrubs and plantations were shifted to another area. The introduction of foreign weeds which thrived was a significant issue from the 1820s but offset by the widespread growth of the introduced potato, the traditional varieties of which are still grown and known as or Māori potatoes.

European farms and the methods they used became a cultural and economic magnet for Māori in the North, in Auckland and later in the Te Awamutu area of the Waikato. Under the tuition of missionaries, Māori learnt to mass-produce food, especially potatoes, far in excess of their own needs for trading into the late 1850s. In 1858 European numbers equalled Māori numbers and increasingly European farmers were able to supply towns such as Auckland. At the same time the strong market demand for supplying food to the gold rush markets in Australia and California ended.

== Trade and travel ==
===Transport===
The normal Māori method of travel was on foot. The North Island had an extensive network of single lane one metre wide tracks that traversed beaches, plains, valleys and mountain passes. Some of these tracks were used by many and were considered neutral territory. Missionaries who travelled with Māori guides found that at river crossings canoes were left for the use of any traveller. Between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers, artists, government officials including Governor Grey travelled inland with the aid of Māori guides. The guides carried heavy loads and would carry Europeans across creeks. Crossing swamps was common. Although they carried some food they relied on purchasing basic foodstuffs such as potatoes or native pigeons from Māori settlements. The most popular payment was in tobacco which was in great demand. In more remote areas travellers sometimes found Māori living by themselves and growing a few potatoes.

Canoes () were used extensively. These ranged from small river-going boats, to the large sea-going war vessels carrying up to 80 paddlers, and up to long. Waka were used extensively for long-range travel down the east coast and to cross Cook Strait. In 1822–23 Te Rauparaha, who had established a base by capturing Kapiti Island, reconnoitred the upper South Island in waka before launching a seaborne invasion the following year against Ngāi Tahu and Rangitāne iwi. Te Rauparahā later hired a European ship to attack Akaroa Harbour. This showed that Te Rauparaha was prepared to use Western technology to further his own goals. Henry Williams, who followed several war parties, reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70–80 ships per year. Many Māori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight Māori seamen per whaling ship. Ten metre long whaleboats began to be used by Māori. They could be both rowed and sailed. In the 1850s as Māori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori.
During the mid 19th century Auckland and Northland Māori dominated shipping trade. In 1851 51 vessels were registered and 30 smaller vessels licensed. By 1857 there were 37 schooners. The fleet increased steadily during the Tasman trade boom of 1853–56. Māori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels, so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit New Zealand especially effecting the Auckland–Waikato–Hauraki area. During the musket war period and for a time afterwards, Maori, isolated from their tribal support by these devastating conflicts, hid in isolated places, living off patches of vegetables they grew in tiny gardens. This practice was very common in Taranaki which had been devastated by Waikato attacks in particular. European explorers, such as Dieffenbach, often stumbled upon these survivors while exploring. He described these as hotbeds for rats and vermin.

===Trade===
With the arrival of Europeans Māori gradually started to trust the value of British money and use it as a medium of exchange instead of goods. This was rare before 1834 but became increasingly common as more Māori worked as sailors on European ships, where they gained a good reputation as being strong capable workers.

By 1839 a large proportion of the Māori trade in goods was paid for in cash, with Māori showing a strong preference for coins rather than paper banknotes. Northern Māori learnt that they could more easily hide cash from their relatives avoiding the traditional obligatory sharing of goods with their . The period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north Māori economy with Māori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the Europeans to the point where Māori became dependent on the flow of European goods to maintain their new way of life.
The effect of trading increased the influence of chiefs over their . Northern traders assumed that the chief was the organisational head of the and all trade went through him including payments for goods purchased. This gave chiefs much more influence, especially after 1835, because trade was so regular. In pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great, largely being restricted to directing warfare. Early European observers noted that at and (meetings) every person, including women, had their say and the chief had no more influence than any other person on the final decision. Where a chief had great , especially powers of persuasion, chiefs had more influence because of their personality rather than any recognised authority.
Not all had regular contact with Europeans. The French explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville visited Tasman Bay in 1827 and using knowledge he had picked up at the Bay of Islands was able to communicate with local Māori. He found that although they had some passing awareness of Europeans—they seemed to know about firearms—the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the Northern Māori.

In the Waikato regular contact did not start until five decades after contact in the north of New Zealand. It was not until Ngāti Toa was forced out of Kāwhia in 1821 that the bulk of the Tainui people had contact with Europeans. In 1823 a man called Te Puaha visited the Bay of Islands, bringing back with him Captain Kent who arrived on his ship, Elizabeth Henrietta, at Kāwhia in 1824.

By 1859 trade was the main area in which Māori interacted with Europeans. Trade was an area that Māori expected to control. From first contact, they had sold or exchanged fresh foodstuffs initially for high-value goods such as axes and later for money. George Grey was keen to encourage Māori trade and commerce and established new laws to empower them in 1846. Māori brought numerous cases under this legislation and won. This was their first and most successful legal experience. Māori had begun to include European concepts into their own cultural behaviour. In 1886 banknotes were printed (but not issued) by Te Peeke o Aotearoa, a bank established by Tāwhiao the Māori King. The text on these notes was Māori and there was also a picture of a flax bush. The bank&#x27;s cheques had Māori figures and native birds and plants drawn on them.

=== Land negotiations ===

The Māori relationship with the land is complex. Traditionally the resources the land held were controlled based on systems of (power) and (ancestral right). The land itself was both sacred and abstract. In many cases multiple groups would express a connection with the same important river or mountain. Oral tradition would record the migrations of groups from one area to another and their connection with an ancestral location.

In the early 19th century many Europeans entered into dealings with Māori to obtain land for their use. In some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under British law; Māori claimed that the various deeds signed by Māori were more limited and conditional, stopping short of outright alienation. It has been argued that the use of the word in deeds, meaning to let or allow or give freely, was not the same as selling. This and other interpretations of early 19th century New Zealand land deals have been the source of much disagreement both within the Waitangi Tribunal process and outside it.

Māori, especially after 1830, were eager to have Europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from European knowledge and trade. Missionaries on the other hand were keen to buy land so they could grow their own food to make them less dependent on tribal &quot;protectors&quot;, who sometimes used food supplies to coerce them. Settlers allowed Māori to stay on the land they had &quot;bought&quot; and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs, often prompted by the chiefs themselves, in order to maintain friendly relationships. These compromises stopped with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.

Another reason for Māori to &quot;sell&quot; land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors. Māori who had converted to Christianity wanted to protect their land without resorting to warfare. Some degree of control passed to the missionaries who Māori trusted to allow them continued access and use.

From 1840 generally, older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as Māori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from Māori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with Māori owners for much larger areas of land. Short-term leases gave Māori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.

The Native Lands Act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865, which allowed the Māori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell. This act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for European settlers to directly purchase land for themselves.

From the late 1840s some Māori tribes felt that the crown was not fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi or individual land deals. These claims against the government were to become a major feature of politics. Each generation of leaders were judged based on their ability to progress a land claim.

== Leadership and politics ==
=== Māori kingship ===

From the time of their arrival in New Zealand, Māori lived in tribes that functioned independently under the leadership of their own chiefs. However, by the 1850s Māori were faced with increasing numbers of British settlers, political marginalisation and growing demand from the Crown to purchase their lands. From about 1853 Māori began reviving the ancient tribal or chiefly war councils where land issues were raised and in May 1854 a large meeting – attracting as many as 2000 Māori leaders – was held at Manawapou in south Taranaki where speakers urged concerted opposition to selling land. Inspired by a trip to England during which he had met Queen Victoria, Te Rauparaha&#x27;s son, Tamihana Te Rauparaha, used the to promote the idea of forming a Māori kingdom, with one king ruling over all tribes. The or unity movement was aimed at bringing to Māori the unity that was an obvious strength among the Europeans. It was believed that by having a monarch who could claim status similar to that of Queen Victoria, Māori would be able to deal with Pākehā (Europeans) on equal footing. It was also intended to establish a system of law and order in Māori communities to which the Auckland government had so far shown little interest.

Several North Island candidates who were asked to put themselves forward declined, but in February 1857 Wiremu Tamihana, a chief of the Ngāti Hauā in eastern Waikato, proposed the elderly and high-ranking Waikato chief Te Wherowhero as an ideal monarch and despite his initial reluctance he was crowned at Ngāruawāhia in June 1858, later adopting the name Pōtatau Te Wherowhero or simply Pōtatau. Though there was widespread respect for the movement&#x27;s efforts in establishing a &quot;land league&quot; to slow land sales, Pōtatau&#x27;s role was strongly embraced only by Waikato Māori, with of North Auckland and south of Waikato showing him scant recognition. Over time the King Movement came to have a flag, a council of state, a code of laws, a &quot;King&#x27;s Resident Magistrate&quot;, police, a bank, a surveyor and a newspaper, &quot;&quot;, all of which gave the movement the appearance of an alternative government.

Pōtatau was succeeded at his death in 1860 by Matutaera Tāwhiao, whose 34-year reign coincided with the military invasion of the Waikato, which was partly aimed at crushing the Kingitanga movement, with the government viewing it as a challenge to the supremacy of the British monarchy. Six Māori monarchs have subsequently held the throne, including Tūheitia, who died in 2024. His daughter Ngā Wai Hono i te Pō is now the monarch. Historic traditions such as the (annual visits by the monarch to ) and the (coronation celebrations) continue.

Today, the Māori monarch is a non-constitutional role with no legal power from the perspective of the New Zealand government. Reigning monarchs retain the position of paramount chief of several important tribes and wield some power over these, especially within Tainui.

== Warfare ==

From the Classic period warfare was an important part of Māori culture. This continued through the contact period and was expressed during the 20th century by large groups of volunteers in the First and Second world wars. Currently Māori men are over-represented in the New Zealand Army, Navy and private military organisations. New Zealand&#x27;s army is identified as its own tribe, &quot;Ngāti Tūmatauenga&quot; (&quot;Tribe of the War God&quot;).

<text>Kimjongilia is a flower named after the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. It is a hybrid cultivar of tuberous begonia, registered as &quot;Begonia&quot; × &quot;tuberhybrida&quot; &#x27;Kimjongilhwa&#x27;. When Kim Jong Il died in December 2011, the flower was used to adorn his body for public display. Despite its name, the Kimjongilia is not the official national flower of North Korea, which is the &quot;Magnolia sieboldii&quot;. Another flower, Kimilsungia, is an orchid cultivar named after Kim Jong Il&#x27;s father and predecessor, Kim Il Sung.

==History==
To commemorate Kim Jong Il&#x27;s 46th birthday in 1988, Japanese botanist Kamo Mototeru cultivated a new perennial begonia named &quot;kimjongilia&quot; (literally, &quot;flower of Kim Jong-il&quot;), representing the &quot;Juche&quot; revolutionary cause of the Dear Leader. It was presented as a &quot;token of friendship between Korea and Japan&quot;. The flower symbolizes wisdom, love, justice and peace. It is designed to bloom every year on Kim Jong Il&#x27;s birthday, February 16.

==Bloom==
The flower has been cultivated to bloom around the Day of the Shining Star, Kim Jong Il&#x27;s birthday, 16 February. According to the Korean Central News Agency, a preservation agent had been developed that would allow the flower to keep in bloom for longer periods of time.

==Song==
A song composed by several North Korean composers, also called &quot;Kimjongilia&quot;, was written about the flower:

<text>The Societé anonyme belge d&#x27;Exploitation de la Navigation aérienne (French; ), better known by the acronym Sabena or SABENA, was the national airline and flag carrier of Belgium from 1923 to 2001, with its base at Brussels Airport. After its bankruptcy in 2001, SN Brussels Airlines was formed through a takeover of former subsidiary Delta Air Transport and took over part of Sabena&#x27;s assets in February 2002. SN Brussels Airlines merged with Virgin Express in 2007 to form Brussels Airlines. The airline&#x27;s corporate headquarters were located in the Sabena House on the grounds of Brussels Airport in Zaventem.

==History==

===1923–1939: Beginnings===

Sabena began operations on 23 May 1923 as the national carrier of Belgium. The airline was created by the Belgian Government with help of the Devriendt Family after its predecessor SNETA (&quot;Syndicat national pour l&#x27;étude des transports aériens&quot;, National Syndicate for the Study of Aerial Transports) - formed in 1919 to pioneer commercial aviation in Belgium - ceased operations. Sabena operated its first commercial flight from Haren Brussels to London (England) on 1 July 1923, via Ostend. Services to Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Strasbourg (France) were launched on 1 April 1924. The Strasbourg service was extended to Basel (Switzerland) on 10 June 1924. Amsterdam (Netherlands) was added on 1 September 1924, and Hamburg (Germany) followed on 1 May 1929 via Antwerp, Düsseldorf and Essen.

====Belgian Congo====
When Sabena was created, the airline was partly funded by Belgians in the Belgian Congo colony who had lost their air service, an experimental passenger and cargo company (LARA) between Léopoldville, Lisala, and Stanleyville a year earlier. They expected the new Belgian national airline to fill this gap. On 12 February 1925, Sabena aviators Edmond Thieffry, Léopold Roger and Joseph De Brycker succeeded in the feat of flying their Handley Page W8 F biplane from Brussels, capital of Belgium, to Léopoldville (now Kinshasa), capital of the Belgian Congo, pioneering a long haul route for passengers traveling between Europe and Africa, and King Albert&#x27;s daughter, Princess Marie-José flew the route on April 3. Throughout its history, Sabena had a long tradition of service to African destinations and for a long time, these were the only profitable routes served by the airline.

Sabena used land planes for its Congo operations and a program of aerodrome construction was initiated in the Congo. This was finished in 1926 and Sabena immediately began flights within the Belgian colony, the main route being Boma-Léopoldville-Élisabethville, a 2,288 km (1,422 mi) route over dense jungle. First, flights were operated with De Havilland DH.50s, although these were quickly replaced by the larger Handley Page W.8f which had three engines and offered ten seats.

By 1931 Sabena&#x27;s fleet, including the aircraft used on the Congo network, totalled 43 aircraft. Its mainstay type was the Fokker F.VIIB with a lesser number of smaller Fokker VIIA and 14 Handley-Page types. It also flew British Westland Wessex aircraft.

Sabena occasionally flew to tropical Africa, Belgium&#x27;s Congo colony, but mostly these aircraft were shipped out. There was no direct flight yet between Belgium and the colony. As the 1930s progressed, Sabena cooperated with Air France and Deutsche Luft Hansa, which also had interests in routes to destinations across Africa.

Sabena&#x27;s first long-haul flight to the Congo occurred on 12 February 1935 and took five and a half days, for which Sabena used a Fokker F-VII/3m aircraft. The following year, Sabena purchased the Savoia-Marchetti SM.73 airliner. With a speed of 300 km/h (200 mph), it reduced the journey time to only four days, and the Sabena service ran on alternate weeks to an Air Afrique service.
====Expansion in Europe====
In Europe, Sabena opened services to Copenhagen and Malmö in 1931 and a route to Berlin was initiated in 1932. The mainstay pre-war airliner that Sabena used in Europe was the successful Junkers Ju 52/3m airliner. The airline&#x27;s pre-war routes covered almost 6,000 km within Europe. While the Brussels Haren Airport was Sabena&#x27;s main base, the company also operated services from other Belgian airports and had a domestic network that was mainly used by businessmen who wanted to be in their coastal villas for the weekend.

In 1938, the airline purchased the new Savoia-Marchetti SM.83, a development of the S.M. 73 with a speed of 435 km/h (270 mph), although it flew services at a cruising speed of about 400 km/h (250 mph).

===1939–1946: Wartime===
At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Sabena&#x27;s fleet totalled 18 aircraft. Its mainstay fleet type was the Savoia-Marchetti SM.73 airliner (it had 11 of the type) and the Junkers Ju 52/3m airliner (it had five). Sabena also had just taken delivery of two Douglas DC-3s.

During the war, the airline maintained its Belgian Congo routes, but all European services ceased.

===1946–1960: Transatlantic expansion===
After the war, in 1946 Sabena resumed operating a network of intra-European scheduled services. The fleet initially consisted mainly of Douglas DC-3s. There were thousands of surplus Douglas C-47 Skytrains (the military variant of the DC-3) available to help airlines restart operations after the war. The airline now flew under the name of SABENA - Belgian World Airlines.

Sabena started its first transatlantic route to New York City on 4 June 1946, initially using unpressurised Douglas DC-4 airliners which were augmented and later replaced by Douglas DC-6Bs. The DC-4s also restarted the airline&#x27;s traditional route to the Belgian Congo. Sabena was the first airline to introduce transatlantic schedules from the north of England, when one of its DC-6Bs inaugurated the Brussels-Manchester-New York route on 28 October 1953.

The Convair 240 was introduced in 1949 to partially replace the DC-3s that until then had flown most European services. As of 1956, improved Convair 440 &quot;Metropolitan&quot; twins began replacing the Convair 240 twins and were used successfully well into the 1960s between European regional destinations.

In 1957, the long-range Douglas DC-7C was introduced for long-haul routes but this plane would begin to be supplanted after only three years by the jet age. It remained in service on the transatlantic route until 1962.

On 3 June 1954, a Soviet Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 (NATO reporting name &quot;Fagot&quot;) attacked a Sabena-operated Douglas DC-3 on a cargo flight from the United Kingdom to Yugoslavia, killing the radio operator and wounding both the captain and engineer. Co-pilot Douglas Wilson managed to land in Austria but the plane suffered significant damage.

For the 1958 world exposition in Brussels, Sabena leased two Lockheed Super Constellations from Seaboard World Airlines, using them mainly on transatlantic routes. In the same period, there were experiments with helicopter passenger service using Sikorsky S-58 aircraft from Brussels to Antwerp, Rotterdam, Eindhoven and the Paris heliport at Issy-les-Moulineaux.

===1960–1990: The jet age===



1960 saw the introduction of the Boeing 707-320 intercontinental jet for trans-Atlantic flights to New York. SABENA was mainland Europe&#x27;s first airline to operate a jet across the Atlantic (BOAC had been flying jet transatlantic services using the de Havilland Comet 4 since 4 October 1958). One of Sabena&#x27;s aircraft became the first Boeing 707 to crash while in commercial service when Flight 548 crashed while preparing to land at the Brussels Airport on 15 February 1961. The United States Figure Skating Team was aboard the aircraft, en route from New York to Prague via Brussels to compete in a figure skating championship.

Six Caravelle jetliners were introduced on all medium-haul routes in Europe from February 1961, being flown on most routes alongside the Convair 440s, until the early 1970s.

The beginning of the 1960s saw a major upheaval for Sabena in the Congo. Widespread rioting against Belgian colonials in the months leading up to, and after the independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, caused thousands of Belgians to flee the country. The Belgian government commandeered Sabena&#x27;s entire long-haul fleet to get the refugees back to Europe. Independence also meant the end of the impressive regional network of routes that the airline had built up in the Congo since 1924. When the new republic began its own airline, Air Congo, in June 1961, Sabena held 30 per cent of that airline&#x27;s shares.

The Douglas DC-6Bs remained in service with Sabena in the mid-1960s although they were no longer used on the airline&#x27;s main routes. The Boeing 707s and Caravelles became the mainstay types during this decade. Boeing 727-100s were introduced on important European routes and also some African services from 1967 in a unique colour scheme; the fin markings incorporated bare-metal rudder and white engine colours. At this time Fokker F27s entered service between regional Belgian airports and European destinations such as London Heathrow.

The Boeing 747-100 was introduced in 1971, on transatlantic routes flying alongside the Boeing 707-320Cs. Sabena, like many other trans-Atlantic airlines, was satisfied with the Boeing 707s. For commercial reasons, it was recognised that it had to buy jumbo jets for its prestige services, notably New York JFK and as of the mid-seventies, Chicago O&#x27;Hare. Sabena purchased only two first-generation jumbo jets, one named &quot;Tante Agathe&quot; (which means Aunt Agathe in French and Dutch, the national languages of Belgium), and it continued to fly the 707 into the early 1980s, as the Boeing 747-100&#x27;s last flight occurred in 1993.

In 1973, the Boeing 727s on the European network were replaced by Boeing 737-200s. The McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 entered service in 1974. In total, Sabena purchased five of these convertible (Passengers and/or freight) combi aircraft wide-body jets.

In 1984 Airbus A310s were introduced on routes that had high passenger density. This aircraft type also introduced a modernisation of the 1973 Sabena livery, in which a lighter blue was used and the titles on the fuselage were in a more modern style.

In June 1986 the first of two Boeing 747-300 aircraft joined the fleet, eventually replacing the older 747-100s.

In 1989 Sabena invited Belgian fashion designer Olivier Strelli to create a new range of uniforms for its cabin crews.

===1990–1995: Sabena World Airlines===

A new name, Sabena World Airlines, and colours were introduced for the 1990s. The new livery had an overall white colour and the white circle tail logo in blue on the fin. A large &quot;Sabena&quot; title covered the fuselage in light blue and the name &quot;Belgian World Airlines&quot; was at times just visible, though the title was also painted on the fuselage in small, clear letters. The 1990s saw further fleet type renewal: the DC-10-30s were replaced with twin-engined Airbus A330 and the Boeing 747s with four-engined Airbus A340.
After the liberalisation of the airline industry throughout Europe and the economic consequences of the Gulf War, the Belgian government, the main shareholder of the company, realized that Sabena had little chance of surviving on its own in this very competitive market, and began searching for a suitable partner.

Sabena remained in a poor financial state, and year after year the Belgian government had to cover losses, however it was prevented from providing new funds due to EU State Aid rules. For help in business due to their financial problems, Sabena leased a couple of Boeing 747s from Air France. Many more aircraft were leased for longer periods, but had to keep their distinctive French registration numbers. 
Around 1987, SAS tried to merge with the carrier, but the merger was blocked by the Belgian authorities. In 1989, British Airways and KLM purchased stakes in Sabena, which were later sold back to the Belgian government. In 1993, Air France purchased a large minority stake in Sabena, which it sold soon after. Finally, in 1995, Swissair purchased a 49 percent stake in Sabena and took over management.

In 1993 Sabena adopted its third and final logo, and its head office was in the Air Terminus building on Rue Cardinal Mercier in Brussels.

In 1994, Paul Rusesabagina, a manager for Sabena-owned hotels in the former Belgian territory of Rwanda, sheltered over 1200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus at the Hôtel des Mille Collines of Kigali, saving them from being slaughtered by the Interahamwe militia during the Rwandan genocide (this is depicted in the 2004 motion picture &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;).

===1995–2001: Swissair control===
When Swissair took over management of the airline, a few modifications were made to the aircraft&#x27;s liveries, including a sticker, saying: &quot;Flying together with Swissair&quot;. 
In March and April 1998 two McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 aircraft, both leased from CityBird, joined the fleet and such long-haul destinations as Newark, Montreal and São Paulo were (re)introduced. Also, that year saw the delivery of the last passenger version of the MD-11 from Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas a year before.

1999 saw new colours introduced to the fleet, beginning with an Airbus A340. One of the latest fleet types that Sabena introduced, right after the A321 and A320 was the A319 which saw service in 2000. These new planes were part of a record-order of 34 Airbus A320 family aircraft, imposed on Sabena when under Swissair management.

===2001: Bankruptcy===

After an airline recession and the effects on the airline industry of the September 11 attacks in 2001, all airlines that flew across the Atlantic suffered. Swissair had pledged to invest millions in Sabena but failed to do so, partly because the airline had financial problems itself, having filed for bankruptcy protection one month prior. Sabena filed for legal protection against its creditors on 3 October, and went into liquidation on 6 November 2001. Fred Chaffart, chairman of the board of directors of Sabena, read a declaration on this day to explain the decision.

7 November 2001 was the final day of operations for Sabena. Flight 690 (operated by an Airbus A340-311 registered as OO-SCZ) from Abidjan, Ivory Coast and Cotonou, Benin, was the last Sabena flight to land in Brussels. The flight had 266 passengers and eleven crew members.

A group of investors managed to take over Delta Air Transport, one of Sabena&#x27;s subsidiaries, and transformed it into SN Brussels Airlines. That airline merged with Virgin Express in 2006 to form a new company, Brussels Airlines.

The Belgian Parliament formed a committee to investigate the reasons behind the bankruptcy of Sabena and the involvement of Switzerland&#x27;s flag carrier. At the same time, the company&#x27;s administrator investigated possible legal steps against Swissair, and its successors in interest Swiss International Air Lines and Lufthansa.

In 2006, the Belgian government, a former major shareholder, filed criminal charges against the former Swissair management. The former Swissair management was condemned by the judges.

On 16 January 2007 the Belgian - Flemish news program &quot;Terzake&quot; reported that during the 1990s, several members of the board were paid large sums illegally through a Sabena affiliate in Bermuda. When Paul Reutlinger became the CEO of the company, he stopped the illegal payments. &quot;Terzake&quot; went on to state that this might explain why the Belgian board members remained quiet when it became apparent Swissair was exploiting Sabena and eventually drove the company into bankruptcy.

The reasons for the bankruptcy of Sabena are numerous. One of the direct causes was Swissair not living up to their contractual obligations and failing to inject necessary funds into the company. This was because at the time Swissair was having its own financial problems. In the so-called &quot;Hotel Agreement&quot;, signed on July 17, 2001, Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt met with Swissair boss Mario Corti, who agreed to inject €258 million into Sabena, but the sum was never paid. The purchase of 34 new Airbus A320 family planes, imposed under Swissair&#x27;s management, was a burden with which Sabena could not cope.

After the bankruptcy, a parliamentary commission in Belgium was established to investigate the demise of the airline. The Belgian politicians got a part of the blame; Rik Daems, who, at the time, was Minister of Public Enterprises and Participations, Telecommunication and Middle Classes, received the most criticism due to his lack of effort. Swissair itself went bankrupt in October 2001 and was liquidated in March 2002.

==Destinations==
The flight schedule of Sabena published in March 2001 comprised 33 cities in Europe, 17 in Africa, 6 in North America, and 4 in Asia. In addition to its air destinations, Sabena also had a ground shuttle service between Valenciennes, France, and Brussels Airport.
==Fleet==
Sabena&#x27;s fleet consisted of the following aircraft at the time of the bankruptcy in November 2001:

During the time of the airline&#x27;s existence, Sabena also operated these aircraft:

==Accidents and incidents==
*7 December 1934: At least two SABENA aircraft were destroyed in a hangar fire at Haren Airport as a result of a crash of a military Fairey Fox biplane.

===Flights to or from Europe===
*11 September 1930: A SABCA F7b/3m (OO-AIN) lost control and crashed shortly after takeoff from Croydon Airport following an unexplained in-flight fire, killing both pilots.
*10 December 1935: A Savoia-Marchetti S.73 (registered OO-AGN) crashed at Tatsfield, Surrey, United Kingdom, with the loss of 11 lives.
*4 January 1937: Max Wenner disappeared from a Savoia Marchetti S.73 (registration OO-AGP) over Belgium; the plane itself was dismantled and hauled away by the Germans shortly after invasion of Belgium in 1940.
*16 November 1937: A Junkers Ju 52/3m (registered OO-AUB) crashed near Ostend, Belgium, while landing, killing all 12 people on board.
*10 October 1938: A Savoia-Marchetti S.73 (OO-AGT) broke up in mid-air over Soest, Germany en route to Berlin from Düsseldorf, killing all 20 on board.
*14 March 1939: A Junkers Ju 52/3mge (OO-AUA) crashed in a field at Sint-Stevens-Woluwe due to pilot error, killing the three crew. The aircraft was operating a cargo (mail) from London to Brussels.
*17 September 1946: A Douglas DC-3 (registered OO-AUR) crashed upon takeoff from Haren Airport, killing one crew member. The other two crew and four passengers on board the flight bound for Croydon Airport survived. The aircraft had lost airspeed on takeoff for unknown reasons.

*18 September 1946: 27 people died when a SABENA Douglas DC-4 (OO-CBG) crashed 35 km short of Gander, Newfoundland, where the aircraft planned to land for a refueling stop on the flight from Brussels to New York. At the time of the accident, there was dense fog near the airport, and the pilot executed a flawed approach at too low an altitude. There were 17 survivors (16 passengers and one crew). The dead remain buried on location beside the remains of the wreck of the aircraft.
*2 March 1948: The 19 passengers and three crew members on a flight from Brussels to London died when a Douglas DC-3 registered OO-AWH, crashed on approach to London Heathrow Airport in low visibility conditions.
*18 December 1949: A Douglas DC-3 (registered OO-AUQ) crashed near Aulnay-sous-Bois, France, killing the four passengers and four crew on board. The aircraft had just left Le Bourget Airport for a flight to Brussels, when a wing separated.
*14 October 1953: A Convair CV-240 (registered OO-AWQ) crashed near Kelsterbach, West Germany, killing the 40 passengers and four crew aboard the flight from Frankfurt to Brussels. Engine power was lost upon takeoff from Frankfurt Airport, making the aircraft impossible to control. The accident remains the deadliest involving the Convair 240.
*19 December 1953: One passenger on board a flight from Brussels to Zürich was killed when the aircraft (a CV-240 registered OO-AWO) hit the ground 2.5 km short of the runway threshold of Kloten Airport. In low visibility conditions, the pilot descended below the glidepath. The other 39 passengers and three crew members survived the accident.
*3 June 1954: A Douglas DC-3 (registered OO-CBY) was by a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter aircraft near Maribor, Yugoslavia. The aircraft, on a cargo flight from Blackbushe Airport to Belgrade, remained airborne, and a forced landing at Graz Airport was carried out, during which it ran off the runway. In the incident, one out of the four people on board was killed.
*13 February 1955: The pilots of Flight 503 from Brussels to Rome lost orientation when approaching Ciampino Airport, resulting in the Douglas DC-6 registered OO-SDB crashing into the slope of Monte Terminillo, killing the 21 passengers and eight crew on board.
*15 February 1961: The crash of Flight 548 with its 73 casualties marked the worst accident in the history of SABENA. The aircraft, a Boeing 707 registered OO-SJB, crashed at Brussels Airport at the end of a flight from New York City. Among the dead were the entire American delegation to the 1961 World Figure Skating Championships slated to be held in Prague; the competition was canceled in the aftermath.
*13 July 1968: , a cargo-configured 707 (registered OO-SJK) crashed upon approach to Lagos Airport in Nigeria on a flight from Brussels, killing the seven occupants. It was determined that the aircraft descended too low and struck trees.
*9 May 1970: A Douglas DC-3 (registered OO-AUX) was damaged beyond repair in a ground accident at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The pilots began to taxi the aircraft even though they had not been cleared to do so, which resulted in the right propeller hitting an obstacle on the ground, and debris destroying the airliner beyond economic repair. The aircraft had been leased from Delta Air Transport.
*8 May 1972: Flight 571 from Vienna to Tel Aviv with 101 people on board (a Boeing 707 registered OO-SJG) was hijacked by four members of the terrorist organization Black September, in order to secure the release of 315 detainees from Israeli prisons. At Ben-Gurion International Airport, two hijackers were shot and killed by the Israeli &quot;Sayeret Matkal&quot; special forces. One passenger died later of the wounds she had suffered in the shootout.

*15 February 1978: A Boeing 707 (registered OO-SJE) undershot the runway at Los Rodeos Airport, causing the nose gear to collapse, at the end of a chartered holiday flight from Brussels with 189 passengers and seven crew on board. All passengers and crew were evacuated safely but the spilled fuel caught fire, destroying the aircraft.
*4 April 1978: A Boeing 737-200 (registered OO-SDH) on a training flight suffered a bird strike during a practice landing at Charleroi Airport. The pilot instructor attempted to get the aircraft airborne again, but failed because of insufficient remaining runway. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
*29 August 1998: Flight 542 from New York to Brussels with 248 passengers and 11 crew members on board, an Airbus A340-200 (registered OO-SCW), suffered a broken right landing gear upon landing at Brussels Airport. The aircraft veered off the runway. There were no notable injuries in the ensuing evacuation, and the aircraft was repaired. Main gear metal fatigue was blamed for the incident.
*13 October 2000: Flight 689 from Brussels to Abidjan was hijacked by a Nigerian national who was due to be deported. The Airbus A330-200 with 146 other passengers and 11 crew members on board was forced to land at Málaga Airport in Spain, where the perpetrator was overpowered by local police forces.
*4 December 2000: Flight 877 from Brussels to Nairobi, Kenya, via Bujumbura, Burundi, was struck by machine gun fire as it approached Bujumbura. Bullets had injured a passenger and cabin crew member. One engine also suffered damage. The Airbus A330-200 registered OO-SFR, carrying 170 passengers and crew, was struck in an attack blamed by the government on Hutu rebels, who denied responsibility. The aircraft landed safely but did not continue the flight. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.

===Flights in the Belgian colonies===
*26 January 1937: A SABCA S.73 (OO-AGR) crashed south of Oran-es Senia Airport, Algeria during a round trip from Belgium to Belgian Congo, killing all 12 on board. During the flight back to Belgium the aircraft was approaching Oran for an en route stop. Witnesses noticed the aircraft flying at when it went into a sudden nosedive until it crashed. The cause was not determined, but bad weather and engine problems were ruled out. Several recommendations were issued in the wake of the accident: the center of gravity and baggage requirements are checked to ensure proper load distribution, ensure adequate maintenance and inspection personnel are available in the Congo and ports of call, review maximum hours of piloting to avoid fatigue as well as provide use of the autopilot, require seat belts for pilots, ensure all security measures are taken for crossing the Mediterranean, and to install more cockpit instruments.
*1 January 1943: A Junkers Ju 52 (registered OO-AUG) crashed 80 mi from Bangui in then French Equatorial Africa.
*25 March 1944 A Junkers Ju 52/3mge (OO-AGU) crashed at Costermansville (now Bukavu), Belgian Congo.
*3 April 1944: A Junkers Ju 52/3mge (OO-AUF) crashed nearby at Mongena.
*14 December 1945: A Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar (registered OO-CAK) caught fire and was subsequently destroyed following a forced landing near Kouandé during a flight that had originated at Lagos, Nigeria.
*7 January 1947: A Douglas DC-3 (registered OO-CBO) crashed near Costermansville.
*24 December 1947: A Lockheed Lodestar (registered OO-CAR) experienced an engine failure shortly after take-off from an airfield near Mitwaba, then French Congo, and subsequently crashed, killing the five occupants on board.
*12 May 1948: A Douglas DC-4 (registered OO-CBE) crashed near Magazini after flying into a tornado at low altitude during a scheduled passenger flight from Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) to Libenge, then Belgian Congo, killing the 24 passengers and seven crew members; only one passenger survived.
*31 August 1948: Another 13 people (ten passengers, three crew) were killed when their aircraft, a Douglas DC-3 (registered OO-UBL), crashed near Kimbwe en route to Elizabethville (now Lubumbashi) from Manono.
*27 August 1949: A Douglas DC-3 (registered OO-CBK) experienced a loss of engine power shortly after take-off from Leopoldville Airport for a flight to Elizabethville (now Lubumbashi), with 17 passengers and three crew on board. The three crew members and two out of the seventeen passengers on board died in the ensuing .
*24 July 1951: The right engine of a cargo-configured Douglas DC-3 (registered OO-CBA) failed on takeoff from Gao Airfield and , resulting in the loss of lives of the three persons on board. The engine failed due to hydraulic failure; hydraulic fluid squirted on the windshield, temporarily blinding the pilots who then lost control of the aircraft.
*4 February 1952: , a C-47A (registered OO-CBA), crashed in the Dibata forest some from Kikwit en route from Costermansville to Léopoldville after a blade broke off the right side propeller and cut through the fuselage, severing control cables and resulting in a loss of control, killing all 16 on board. The propeller blade broke off following a shaft failure when the number two engine stopped suddenly after the piston lug on the No. 6 cylinder failed due to fatigue.
*18 May 1958: A Douglas DC-7 (registered OO-SFA) suffered a problem with its leftmost engine, whilst on a flight from Lisbon to Léopoldville with 56 passengers and nine crew members. The pilots prepared for an emergency landing at Casablanca–Anfa Airport, but shortly before touchdown, a go-around was attempted, which resulted in a stall because of the lesser available engine power. The aircraft crashed into buildings and caught fire, from which only four passengers could be saved alive.

<text>Swissair ( Schweizerische Luftverkehr-AG; : S.A. Suisse pour la Navigation Aérienne) was the national airline of Switzerland between its founding in 1931 and bankruptcy in 2002.

Swissair was formed from a merger between Balair and Ad Astra Aero. For most of its 71 years, it was one of the major international airlines and known as the &quot;Flying Bank&quot; due to its financial stability, causing it to be regarded as a Swiss national symbol and icon. It was headquartered at Zurich Airport, Kloten.

In 1997, the Swissair Group was renamed SAirGroup (although it was again renamed Swissair Group in 2001), with four subdivisions: SAirLines (to which Swissair, regional subsidiaries Crossair and Balair, and leasing subsidiary FlightLease belonged), SAirServices, SAirLogistics, and SAirRelations.

Due to its so-called &quot;Hunter Strategy&quot; of expanding its market by acquiring smaller airlines, Swissair was suffering from over-expansion by the late 1990s. The crash of Swissair Flight 111 in 1998, which killed all 229 people on board, generated a costly lawsuit and negative publicity for the airline. After the economic downturn following the September 11 attacks, Swissair&#x27;s assets dramatically lost value, grounding the already-troubled airline in October 2001. The airline was later revived and kept alive until 31 March 2002 by the Swiss Federal Government. The final Swissair flight landed in Zürich from São Paulo on 1 April 2002.

On 1 April 2002, a former regional subsidiary Crossair renamed itself Swiss International Air Lines and took over most of Swissair&#x27;s routes, planes, and staff. Swissair Group still exists and has since been liquidated. Swiss International Air Lines was taken over by the German airline Lufthansa in 2005.

== History ==
=== Founding years ===
On 26 March 1931, Swissair – Schweizerische Luftverkehr AG (English: &quot;Swissair – Swiss Air Transport&quot;) was founded through the fusion of the airlines Ad Astra Aero (founded in 1919) and Balair (1925). Balz Zimmermann and the Swiss aviation pioneer Walter Mittelholzer were the founding fathers. In contrast to other airlines, it did not receive support from the government. The name &quot;Swissair&quot; was the proposal of Dr Alphonse Ehinger, president of the directorial board of Balair, although &quot;Swissair&quot; was first deemed &quot;un-Swiss&quot;. In the first operational year, 64 people were employed, including ten pilots, seven radio operators, and eight mechanics. Their planes offered 85 seats, and operation was maintained only from March to October. The route network had a length of .

On 17 April 1932, Swissair bought two Lockheed Orions, making them the second European airline to use American planes after the Czechoslovak operator CSA purchased a Ford Trimotor in 1930. The Orion was the fastest commercial aeroplane of its time and was put to use on the &quot;Express Line&quot;, Zürich-Munich-Vienna. This led Lufthansa to ask Heinkel for a model that could top Orion&#x27;s speed, leading to the Heinkel He 70. The first trans-Alpine route was introduced in 1933: Zürich-Milan.

For the first time in Europe, flight attendants were employed aboard the Curtiss Condor beginning in 1934. Nelly Diener, the first flight attendant in Europe, became world-famous. She was killed after just 79 flights in a crash near Wurmlingen, Germany, on 27 July 1934. The cause of the crash was material fatigue.

In 1936, Douglas DC-2s were acquired, and London was added to the route network. In 1937, the bigger Douglas DC-3 was bought. In the same year, both founding fathers died: Walter Mittelholzer died while mountaineering in Steiermark, Austria, and Balz Zimmermann succumbed to an infectious disease.

On 27 August 1939, days before World War II broke out, the airspace over Germany and France was closed. Swissair was forced to suspend service to Amsterdam, Paris, and London. Two days later, the Swissair service was closed completely. Of 180 employees, 131 had to serve in the army. Despite the war, some routes were later re-introduced, such as Munich, Berlin, Rome, and Barcelona. In 1940, an invasion of Switzerland was feared, and Swissair moved their operations to the Magadino Plains in Ticino. Operations were suspended in August 1944, when a Swissair DC-2 was destroyed in Stuttgart during an American bombing raid.

On 30 July 1945, Swissair was able to resume commercial aviation.

=== Ascension ===

In 1947, the rise of shareholder capital to enabled long-haul flights to New York, South Africa, and South America with Douglas DC-4s. The modern Convair 240, the first Swissair plane with a pressurised cabin, was used for short and medium-range flights starting in late 1948. The first Swissair DC-4 flight to New York was routed via Shannon, Ireland, and Stephenville, Newfoundland, on 2 May 1947. However, it ended in Washington, D.C., due to fog at New York&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport. The total elapsed time was 20 hours and 55 minutes.

The public, including the federal government, cantons, municipalities, the Swiss Federal Railways, and the Swiss postal services, took over 30.6% of the shares and enabled Swissair to get a credit of 15  million Swiss Francs to purchase the airline&#x27;s first two Douglas DC-6B airliners for delivery in 1951. By that act, Swissair became Switzerland&#x27;s national flag carrier. The new pressurised aircraft was to replace the DC-4 on transatlantic routes.

In 1948, the airport in Dübendorf, which had served as the base of Swissair, was relocated to Zürich-Kloten. Military aviation continued in Dübendorf. The next year, Swissair plunged into a financial crisis due to a sudden devaluation of the British pound because fares, except for traffic to the United States, were calculated in British currency. At that time, traffic to England made up 40 per cent of Swissair&#x27;s revenue.

In June 1950, Walter Berchtold, manager of Swiss Federal Railways, was elected to the directorial board of Swissair and served as the director. In 1971, he created the corporate culture of Swissair. He grasped the importance of corporate image and corporate identity and after the example of BOAC&#x27;s &quot;Speedbird&quot;, he introduced the arrow-shaped Swissair logo. Giving flight personnel a distinct uniform was also an important move. At the time, flight attendants&#x27; uniforms resembled the grey-blue ones of the Swiss Women&#x27;s Army Corps, so Berchtold introduced ones in a modish marine blue. Swissair initiated a veritable fashion competition among European airlines.


In 1952, the cabin layout on northern trans-Atlantic routes was changed to one with a first and a tourist (economy) class. The first-class cabin had comfortable chairs in which one could sleep, given the name &quot;Slumberettes&quot;. Those sleeping chairs were soon succeeded by beds, modelled after the US Pullman railway cars. Two adjacent seats were moved towards each other and formed a lower berth. The wall panel could be folded downward, forming the upper berth in which the other person could sleep. A year later, a tourist class cabin was introduced on intra-European flights.

In 1953, Swissair, with the city of Basel, founded a charter company called Balair, reusing the name of one of its predecessors, a company that initially used older Swissair aircraft to fly to holiday destinations.

As the first European customer, Swissair bought the Douglas DC-7C which enabled the company to provide non-stop flights to the United States. For shorter-range routes, the Convair Metropolitan was used.

In 1957, the Far East was added to the route network. Direct flights to Tokyo had intermediate stops in Athens, Karachi, Bombay, Bangkok and Manila. That same year, Swissair helped Aristotle Onassis form the new Greek airline, Olympic Airways.

While competitors first looked at turboprop aeroplanes to replace their piston-engined craft, Swissair introduced jet aeroplanes. Together with SAS, Swissair bought Douglas DC-8s, which were delivered beginning in 1960. For medium and short-range routes, the Sud Aviation Caravelle was purchased. The aircraft were maintained in concert with SAS, and manuals for operation and maintenance were co-written.


Swissair was one of the few companies to order the Convair 990 Coronado for its medium and long-range routes. Although the aircraft did not initially fulfil contractual specifications, they were liked by employees and customers. They operated on the airline&#x27;s routes to South America, West Africa, and the Middle and Far East.

1966 saw the introduction of the Douglas DC-9. That aircraft became the backbone of the short and medium-range routes, and, after convincing Douglas, which soon merged with McDonnell Aircraft to create McDonnell Douglas, ultimately merged with Boeing, offered a stretched variant: the DC-9-32. For the first time, Swissair was the launch customer of an aircraft type.

In 1971, Armin Baltensweiler took over as president of the directorial board and ran the enterprise for over two decades. In the same year, the first Boeing 747-200 jumbo jet was acquired, and in the next year, the first McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 followed. Both types shaped the long-haul fleet until the 1990s. Again, the specifications of both aircraft were developed in collaboration with SAS. Also in 1972, Switzerland introduced a prohibition of night flights, which led to the cessation of cheaper night fares.


In 1973, the company struggled with severe turbulence: a currency crisis, collective chaos, an air traffic controllers&#x27; strike, the October War and the first oil crisis were weathered without significant damage. In the same year, the regional representative of Swissair in Buenos Aires was kidnapped by the Montoneros. After 38 days in captivity, he was released after the payment of ransom. The airline also phased out the CV-990s during that time.

Swissair was the second European airline to offer service to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, introducing service to Beijing and Shanghai in 1975. In the same year, Swissair was the launch customer for the DC-9-51. In 1977, Swissair was the launch customer for the third DC-9 type, the DC-9-81 variant, now called the MD-80. Armin Baltensweiler had travelled to a meeting of the McDonnell-Douglas directorial board in St. Louis to convince them to further stretch the fuselage of the DC-9-51. Baltensweiler was called the &quot;Father of the MD-80&quot;. In 1979, Swissair was the first company to order the Airbus A310 and the jumbo jet variant with a stretched upper deck, the Boeing 747-300. Later on, the Fokker 100 short-range aircraft and the three-engined MD-11 were aircraft for which Swissair was the launch customer. 1983 saw the replacement of the older DC-9s with MD-83s.

Since the 1960s, Swissair has been a world leader in the development of cargo reservation systems (CRS). PARS and CARIDO were examples of systems enabling the booking of passenger seats and freight space.

=== &quot;The flying bank&quot; ===
After the 1960s, air traffic increased quickly and allowed many airlines—many of which were quasi-monopolists on their routes—to yield high revenues. Swissair profited from its well-established reputation as a quality airline and from the fact that the political neutrality of Switzerland allowed the company to fly to exotic and lucrative destinations in Africa, the Middle East, South America and the Far East. In geographic terms, the central position of Switzerland in Europe helped it generate revenue from transfer passengers. By the early 1970s, Swissair was becoming known as &quot;the flying bank&quot;, appealing to the large hidden assets and the huge liquidity Swissair had. Second, &quot;flying bank&quot; was the designation for a corporate group that cared more about financial management than about flying aeroplanes.

With the beginning of deregulation and liberalisation in the late 1970s, airlines felt growing financial pressure. In 1978, Moritz Suter founded a regional airline named Crossair, which put Swissair under additional stress. To counter these changes, Swissair invested their large financial reserves into takeovers and into flight-related trades like baggage handling, catering, aircraft maintenance, and duty-free stores. This strategy diversified economic risks at the expense of the core business of Swissair: commercial aviation.

Due to a 12-day global flight ban for the DC-10 imposed by the US Federal Aviation Administration after the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 on 25 May 1979, a sizable portion of the long-haul fleet was on the ground. On October 7, after landing in Athens, a DC-8 overran the runway and caught fire, killing 14 passengers. By the end of that year, kerosene prices had doubled, and fuel costs had increased from 12% to 16% of total costs. Swissair was the first to order the Airbus A310 designed with a two-man cockpit for more traffic-tight short distances and on shorter medium distances, and accepted options for 10 more units. Another Boeing 747 was ordered. Dublin was added to the route network as a new destination, but service to Beirut had to be discontinued in mid-July due to the political turmoil in Lebanon.

Swissair was able to outperform the competition in a year that experts deemed to be the worst in the history of civil aviation. In contrast to other airlines, which began to offer a second-tier executive class, the proven cabin division into first and economy classes was maintained. The short-haul fleet was renewed with the MD-81 (DC-9-81) introduction. This type of aircraft partially replaced the older and smaller DC-9. In addition, modern, fuel-saving aircraft, such as five new Boeing 747s with extended upper decks and two DC-10-30s with a longer range, were ordered. With the connection of Zurich Airport to the national railway network, bus delivery services from Zürich were discontinued. Air passengers were already able to check their luggage at the rail station. The route network was expanded with service to Jakarta, but flights to Tehran and Baghdad had to be suspended after the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. By the end of 1980, Swissair was represented in 196 cities. New representations or points of sale were opened in Luxembourg, Ulm, Ottawa, Raleigh, Westchester, Valparaíso, Jubil, Sanaa, and Salisbury/Harare. Under the name Swissôtel, the hotels Président in Geneva, International in Zürich, Drake in New York, and Bellevue Palace in Bern were administratively combined.

=== Concentration ===

Regarding further liberalisation of Europe&#x27;s airline market, Swissair focused more on commercial aviation and extended its partnerships. As the first European airline to do so, Swissair signed in 1989 a cooperation treaty with Delta Air Lines and Singapore Airlines to create the alliance &quot;Global Excellence&quot;. In 1990, together with SAS, Austrian Airlines and Finnair, the &quot;European Quality Alliance&quot; was founded. The last alliance was later renamed &quot;The Qualiflyer Group&quot;.

Because of the weak economy, the Gulf War and its aftermath, and rising operational costs, many airlines lost money in 1990 and 1991. Additionally, the ongoing liberalisation of the industry strengthened competition. Consequently, Swissair lost 99 million Swiss Francs in the first half-year and could not pay dividends to its shareholders. In 1991 and 1992, Swissair had to utilise financial reserves to cushion significant losses from the commercial aviation sector.

On 1 January 1991, commercial aviation in Europe was completely liberalised, and existing capacities led to aggressive competition among airlines. In a national referendum held on 6 December 1992, Swiss citizens rejected taking part in the European Economic Area (EEA). This referendum was a significant disservice to Swissair, an airline with a tiny domestic market: its planes were not allowed to take up passengers during intermediate landings in EEA countries (e.g., Zürich-Frankfurt-New York), and Swissair was not allowed to offer tickets for sections that fully lie in EEA member countries (e.g., Zürich-Frankfurt-Paris).

Like other airlines based in smaller countries, Swissair was now under significant pressure. More and more national airlines have affiliated themselves with airline alliances to maintain a worldwide market presence. But to be interesting for American alliance partners, an airline must have a critical size in terms of passenger numbers. To meet that goal, in 1993, an alliance between Swissair, KLM, SAS, and Austrian Airlines was proposed. This project bore the name &quot;Alcazar&quot; to create a single Central European airline. However, in various countries, this project was criticised. In Switzerland itself, it was thought that the huge financial assets were too precious to sacrifice to merge Swissair with the other airlines.

===Hunter Strategy===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swissair tried to merge with Air France, Lufthansa, and British Airways to get access to a wider European market. Finally, after deregulation, Swissair tried to expand beyond its home market; after the Alcazar project was cancelled, Swissair aimed to be a major force in European aviation.

In the mid-1990s, Swissair initiated the disastrous &quot;Hunter Strategy&quot;, a major expansion programme devised by the US consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. Using this strategy, Swissair aimed to grow its market share by acquiring small airlines rather than entering into alliance agreements. Swissair decided to acquire 49.5 per cent of the very successful Italian charter airline Air Europe, the unprofitable Belgian flag carrier Sabena, and significant stakes in the carriers Air Liberté, AOM, Air Littoral, Volare, LOT, Turkish Airlines, South African Airways, Portugália and LTU, and planned to acquire stakes in Aer Lingus, Finnair, Malév, as well as Brazilian carriers TAM and Transbrasil. By mid-2000, it was predicted that Swissair would lose between and over the next three fiscal years. The management, however, maintained classical restructuring, and the Board approved the reorganisation of LTU for approximately . Also, there were plans to take over Alitalia.

In October 1999, Delta Air Lines cancelled its transatlantic Atlantic Excellence alliance with Swissair and Sabena, citing the desire to partner with Air France instead. 

During the European airline deregulation transition, Jeffrey Katz served as CEO of Swissair from 1997 to 2000, a period of increased fuel prices and industry overcapacity.

In the summer of 2000, SAir&#x27;s CEO Philippe Bruggisser came under public pressure as the press published the group&#x27;s financial situation. Swissair and Sabena were each losing one million francs per day, and another million were lost every day at LTU and the French investments. For the first time, the board began to consider scenarios for phasing out its existing participation in other airlines as Swissair looked to withdraw from its foreign investments. In January 2001, Bruggisser was summarily dismissed. Moritz Suter, the founder of Crossair, was nominated as the new CEO of SAirLines and thus all Group airlines, including Swissair. After only 44 days in charge, Suter resigned.

In March 2001, two studies by consultants were presented to the board, which showed the financial difficulties of SAirGroup. At this point, the directors resigned, with only Mario Corti, the former CFO of Nestlé, remaining. From April to August 2001, the group&#x27;s Moody&#x27;s credit rating was gradually downgraded from A3 to B1 (it was downgraded further to B2 on September 18th). The buying spree created a major cash flow crisis for parent company SAirGroup and was exacerbated by the environment caused by the September 11 attacks. Unable to make payments to creditors on its large debt, and with the refusal of UBS to extend its line of credit, on 2 October 2001 the entire Swissair fleet was abruptly grounded. Many blamed UBS for the fiasco, causing demonstrators to take to the streets with signs referring to UBS chairman Marcel Ospel as &quot;Bin Ospel&quot;, quoting al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and redefining the bank&#x27;s acronym, &quot;UBS&quot;, as the &quot;United Bandits of Switzerland&quot;.

Two large bridge loans from the Swiss government were required to finance the continuation of flight operations. This notwithstanding, with the resumption of flight service, it was necessary for flight crews to carry large sums of cash to purchase fuel at foreign airports.

===Grounding===
On 1 October 2001, Project &quot;Phoenix&quot; was announced, under which parts of the group sought a payment delay. The Swiss federal authorities were willing to pay back half of the loan, so they secured the continuation of service.

2 October 2001 saw an increased necessity for strong liquidity, as all suppliers insisted on cash payments of outstanding invoices following a request for payment delay announced the day before. The company&#x27;s cash reserves filed on that day were barely sufficient to carry out the first morning flights. During the morning, fuel suppliers refused to fuel the waiting aircraft. At 15:45 CEST, CEO Mario Corti announced a cessation of flight operations due to the security risks caused by the crossing of the Flight Duty Regulations. This led to the cancellation of over 230 flights, and thousands of passengers, as well as flight crews, were stranded around the world. Flight crew corporate credit cards were blocked by the banks, with some hotels expelling the crew, and having them return home at their own expense. All tickets sold were voided.

4 October 2001 saw demonstrations by former Swissair employees before the UBS presentation held in Glattbrugg, and the following day saw demonstrations in Bern&#x27;s Federal Square.

At around the same time, SAirGroup&#x27;s stake in Crossair was sold to the Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse. Furthermore, Crossair took over various assets of former Swissair, including its employees, aircraft, and most European routes. Swissair and the SAirGroup were handed over to the liquidation firm of Jürg Hoss and ceased operations on 31 March 2002. Crossair was renamed Swiss International Air Lines, or Swiss for short, and took over Swissair&#x27;s intercontinental routes on 1 April 2002, officially ending 71 years of Swissair service.

==== Controversy surrounding Corti&#x27;s decision to ground flights ====
An investigation by the Zurich branch of Ernst &amp; Young into factors behind the grounding revealed that &quot;...in contradiction to representations made by SAir Group, not just 14.5 million Swiss Francs, but around CHF50 million were available at the company&#x27;s disposal on the morning of October 2, 2001&quot;. The report further stated that &quot;Without the administrative inadequacies connected with the release of an escrow account, an additional CHF 73 million would have been available. Thus, overall, some CHF 123 million would have been available at SAirGroup, SAirLines, and Swissair.&quot; Former Crossair executive André Dosé, who also served as the first CEO of successor airline Swiss International Air Lines, stated in 2004 that this meant the grounding was not necessary and that Swissair could have likely continued flying until the financing for a successor airline would have been finalized, a view he reiterated in a 2021 interview. In his 2004 statement, Dose voiced the view that Corti and then-CFO Jacqualyn Fouse had lost oversight of Swissair&#x27;s finances, accounting for this mismatch in perception of available funds.

Mario Corti vehemently rejected the notion that Swissair and SAirGroup bank accounts together held more than 14 million Swiss francs in a public statement after the Ernst &amp; Young report came out.

===Transition phase===
On 5 October, commercial flights on most routes were gradually resumed thanks to a federal emergency loan of over CHF 450 million. This occurred, in part, to ensure Switzerland&#x27;s continued accessibility as a business location and to establish a basis for the creation of Swiss. By preventing the complete collapse of Swissair, the other airline-related businesses of the group were likewise spared collapse.

Following another federal repayable funding commitment of one billion francs, each of the 26 long-haul aircraft (MD-11s and A330s) and 26 medium-haul aircraft (A321s, A320s and A319s) were able to be transferred to Crossair/Swiss at the end of the winter schedule of 2001/02. On Easter Monday, 1 April 2002, the last flight of Swissair, flight SR145 from São Paulo, landed in Zürich. A 71-year-long chapter of Swiss aviation history thus came to an end. Between 1931 and 2002, Swissair transported more than 260 million passengers. The SwissairGroup (the name change from SAirGroup to SwissairGroup was announced in 2001 but never officially implemented) still existed as &#x27;SAirGroup in Nachlassstundung&#x27; (German: &quot;Swissair in Administration&quot;) for several years until all assets were liquidated, including a large auction where many of the remaining Swissair assets, such as historic items, were auctioned. Today, Gategourmet continues as a subsidiary of Gategroup.

=== Factors behind collapse ===
Like other airlines that flew to the United States, Swissair&#x27;s operations and profitability were disrupted in the wake of the terror attacks against the United States. Several politicians were among those included on Swissair&#x27;s Board of directors, and commentators have pointed to potential conflicts of interest as fundamental to the demise of Swissair. Media have also suggested that the directorial board failed to oversee the actions of Philippe Bruggisser (Chief Operating Officer since 1996) and Eric Honegger (board member since 1993 and later board president) and that they left behind a convoluted corporate structure and financial commitments—amongst others, a further purchase of 35.5 per cent of Sabena&#x27;s stock—which would only come to light when Mario Corti was trying to save the airline.

The judiciary is continuing to examine why Swissair acquired counselling that supported the Hunter Strategy and why Swissair continued to make certain payments despite nearing insolvency. Questions have also been raised about the federal aid given to Swissair and the politicians involved. The highly competitive nature of the market during the business&#x27;s final years also precipitated its demise: like its Belgian counterpart Sabena, Swissair fell victim to the rise of competition from budget airlines on their short and medium-haul routes, such as Ryanair and EasyJet.

Imogen Foulkes from the BBC said regarding the collapse: &quot;Something did die in Switzerland that day: not just an airline but an image the Swiss had of themselves and, more importantly, of their business leaders&quot; and &quot;The Swiss financial community&#x27;s reputation for good business sense was already seriously damaged by the Swissair disaster.&quot;

Because civil cases are still going on, some of the reasons why SAirGroup failed are still being looked into by the courts and have not been made clear legally. The following causes are widely recognised as crucial factors:

*The management underestimated the dangers and difficulties in the acquisitions and investments of partially ailing airlines. Therefore, the Belgian airline Sabena and German airline LTU were acquired despite significant capital requirements. Also, investments in France (AOM, Air Liberté, and Air Littoral) required much capital restructuring. Sabena ultimately ceased operations due to the aforementioned financial crisis.
*The indebtedness created by an uncompromising adaptation to the realities of &quot;Hunter strategy&quot; implementation and the lack of monitoring by the Board.
*The 2001 terrorist attacks in the US led to a sharp slump in demand and, consequently to an extreme tightening of liquidity.
*An orderly transfer of operations to Crossair was denied because of the failure to reach a bridging loan and the delayed transfer of the share purchase price.
*Increasing competition from low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet in the short-to-medium-haul markets from Europe caused Swissair to lose passenger revenues.
*A full merger with Sabena was impossible due to Swissair&#x27;s financial crisis.
*An MD-11, operating flight 111, crashed in 1998, killing everyone on board. This event led to further troubles for the airline with negative publicity, a significant lawsuit, more financial problems and lowered customer confidence.

===Legacy===
In April 2002, Swiss International Air Lines commenced operations. First called Swiss Air Lines, this company was based on the former Crossair and was a merger of Crossair and former Swissair employees, routes, aircraft, and intellectual property. The company Swissair continued to exist (in liquidation) but had no further assets. Due to legal problems with Swissair, the name had to be changed to Swiss International Air Lines.

Swiss took over 26 long-haul and 26 medium-haul aircraft from the defunct Swissair fleet and refurbished the liveries and interiors to turn it into the new Swiss fleet, together with the former Crossair Fleet consisting of the Embraer 145, Saab 2000, MD-80 Series, and Avro RJ. The remainder of the Swissair aircraft that were grounded and were not taken by the new company were returned to their lessors.

After problems with the former Crossair pilot unions, who refused to accept different conditions than the former Swissair pilots within the same airline, a subsidiary called Swiss European Air Lines was founded, which belongs 100% to Swiss International Air Lines.

In 2003, it appeared that Swiss was going to become a member of Oneworld. It had codeshares with Oneworld carriers British Airways, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Qantas, Aer Lingus and Finnair, and held a strategic partnership and joint operation for all service to North America and AA-operated flights beyond U.S. gateways using American Airlines. Swiss started to terminate these codeshare agreements but did not terminate the AA alliance. A theory emerged that Swiss was planning to use its partnerships, the AA alliance, and its partnership with British Airways, a strong and supportive member of Oneworld, to join Oneworld itself.

However, in 2005, Swiss was taken over by Lufthansa, the national airline of Germany. With the merger with Lufthansa, Swiss joined the Star Alliance in 2006, which Swissair planned to join before it failed. With this move, Swiss&#x27;s frequent flyer club, Swiss TravelClub became part of Miles &amp; More, which was originally the Lufthansa Group frequent flyer club. It acts as both airlines&#x27; frequent flyer programme, along with many other Lufthansa Group airlines.

=== Management trial ===
A criminal trial began on 16 January 2007 in Bülach. The entire former Swissair management board stood facing criminal charges of mismanagement, false statements, and forgery of documents. The top defendants in the trial were Mario Corti, Philippe Bruggisser, George Schorderet, Jacqualyn Fouse, Eric Honegger, and Verena Spoerry. Corti, Honegger, and Spoerry entered statements proclaiming their innocence.

On 7 June 2007, the court in Bülach cleared the defendants of all criminal charges over the airline&#x27;s 2001 bankruptcy.

===Continued use of the &quot;Swissair&quot; brand===
Swiss retains the rights to the &quot;Swissair&quot; name, whose value was estimated at more than 10 million Swiss francs in 2010. To prevent the trademark from becoming void through disuse, Swiss licensed it to Hopscotch Air, which operates a fleet of Cirrus SR22 planes in the United States, for use from 2010 to 2013. In Switzerland, the trademark is protected through its use by an aviation sports club, &quot;Sportfluggruppe Swissair&quot;.

==Swissair Asia==

Due to Taiwan&#x27;s relations with China, Swissair Asia was formed to serve Taipei, Taiwan, also known as the Republic of China, while Swissair maintained service to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Corporate affairs==
Swissair&#x27;s head office was on the grounds of Zurich Airport and in Kloten.

KSG, Architects G.Müller + G.Berger designed the final head office complex for the airline. It was in proximity to the main airport facilities and area freeways. The first phase of the building included offices for 1,600 workers, computer rooms, printing rooms, and 500-seat restaurant facilities. The second phase included an open-plan office room, another computer laboratory, and expansions of the restaurant facilities.

In the 1930s, the head office was in the Dübendorf Aerodrome in Zürich.

== Accidents and incidents ==
Over the 71-year history of Swissair, there were eleven major incidents reported resulting in 414 fatalities.


==In popular culture==
* A Swissair plane trip was the focus of &quot;The Big Plane Trip&quot; in Little Mammoth Media&#x27;s &quot;BIG Adventure&quot; series. In the video, a plane takes people from the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia to the Zurich Airport in Zürich, Switzerland.
* In the 2012 Golden Globe winning movie Argo, a Swissair Boeing 747-300 is shown with Ben Affleck&#x27;s character Tony Mendez and 6 US embassy staff departing Tehran during the Iranian revolution in 1979. However, the depiction was found to be inaccurate, as the livery shown in the movie was adopted by Swissair in 1980 while the Boeing 747-300 had actually entered service in 1983. In real life, the group departed Iran on a Swissair Douglas DC-8 named &quot;Aargau&quot;.

<text>Crossair Ltd. Co. for Regional European Air Transport () was a Swiss regional airline headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel, Switzerland. 

After taking over most of the assets of Swissair following that airline&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2002, Crossair was restructured to become Swiss International Air Lines.

==History==
The airline was founded as a private company under the name &quot;Business Flyers Basel AG&quot; in 1975 by Moritz Suter. The name later changed to &quot;Crossair&quot; on 18 November 1978, before the beginning of scheduled services on 2 July 1979, with flights from Zürich to Nuremberg, Innsbruck and Klagenfurt. It was headquartered at Zurich Airport in Kloten in 1985. 

It added charter services for major shareholder Swissair in November 1995.

After parent company SAirGroup had to apply for a debt restructuring moratorium in October 2001, it became necessary to change the entire planning. On 31 March 2002, Swissair ceased all operations while most of its assets were taken over by Crossair which then was subsequently restructured and rebranded to become Swiss International Air Lines.

==Head office==
Crossair was headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel, Switzerland. In 2002 the name &quot;Crossair&quot; was replaced with &quot;Swiss International Air Lines&quot; on the head office building.

==Destinations==
Crossair flew from Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lugano and Zurich. Crossair was very interested in serving from several hubs and, therefore set up a multi-hub business plan. Crossair set up a Eurocross scheme from their Basel base to serve smaller airports and transfer their passengers to larger hubs with short transit times (only around 20 minutes) This helped Crossair link with partners, such as Swissair from Zurich. Crossair also operated flights between Swiss airports.

==Fleet==

Crossair has operated the following aircraft throughout its existence:

==Accidents and incidents==
*10 January 2000: Crossair Flight 498 crashed just after take-off from Zürich. All 10 people aboard were killed.

*24 November 2001: Crossair Flight 3597 crashed near Zürich, killing 24 of 33 people aboard, including the former La Bouche lead singer Melanie Thornton and two of the three members of the German Eurodance group Passion Fruit. The third member, Debby St. Maarten, sustained serious injuries but survived.

<doc id="162891" wikidata="Q1686300" url="?curid=162891" title="Jeff Fenech">
<text>Jeff Fenech (born 28 May 1964) is an Australian former professional boxer who competed between 1984 and 2008. He won world titles in three weight divisions, having held the IBF bantamweight title from 1985 to 1987, the WBC super-bantamweight title from 1987 to 1988, the WBC featherweight title from 1988 to 1990. He retroactively won a fourth weight division title, the WBC super-featherweight title in 1991, after the WBC recounted his first bout against Azumah Nelson which had been a controversial decision draw. Fenech was trained by renowned Sydney-based trainer Johnny Lewis.
Jeff Fenech was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2002 and the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame Moderns category in 2003, and became the 4th person to be elevated to Legend status in 2013.

==Boxing career==
Fenech was born in St Peters, Sydney and is of Maltese parentage. After playing junior rugby league and getting into trouble with the police as a child, Fenech was turned onto boxing when he attended the Newtown Police Boys Club in Sydney where he met Johnny Lewis. From there Fenech had a stellar amateur career, which led to him representing his country at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles where he was selected as the boxing team captain. At the Olympics, Fenech lost a controversial quarter-final bout to Yugoslavian Redžep Redžepovski. Fenech was initially given the decision, but after intervention by the Olympic Boxing Committee and a total recount, the decision was reversed with Redžepovski being awarded the win. Many of the other boxers and those in the press felt that Fenech had been robbed of a chance to win an Olympic medal and most boxing writers noted how political amateur boxing was, especially at the Olympic Games.

It was that decision that led Fenech to turn professional later in 1984, and in his first professional fight he defeated Bobby Williams by a knockout in round two. Fenech quickly gained a reputation as a fast starter: he won his first eleven bouts by knockout, and held his first fight abroad in only his fourth fight, when he beat Iliesa Manila by a knockout in two rounds in Fiji.
He beat fringe contenders Wayne Mulholland and Rolando Navarro, both by a knockout in the fifth round, to start 1985. After those two wins, he was placed number one among the world&#x27;s bantamweights by the International Boxing Federation. However, his early wins by KO had some of the press wondering if he could last the full 15 round distance.
===Bantamweight champion===
Fenech took only six professional fights to become the number one contender. He became the eighth-fastest boxer to fight for a world title after beginning his career when he challenged Satoshi Shingaki for the IBF Bantamweight title in only his seventh bout, displacing the second Davey Moore, and trailing Shingaki himself, Leon Spinks, Saensak Muangsurin, Pete Rademacher, Joves De La Puz, Joko Arter and Rafael Lovera. Fenech was the third fastest boxer to become a world champion, behind Muangsuring and Spinks, when he knocked out Shingaki in nine rounds in front of a packed house at the Horden Pavilion in Sydney. After two non-title knockout wins, he gave Shingaki a rematch at the State Sports Centre in Sydney and retained the crown with a knockout in three rounds. After one more non-title knockout win, Fenech had to go the distance for the first time, when he faced American Jerome Coffee at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, retaining the title by a 15-round unanimous decision.
In 1986, Fenech had only two bouts, but they were both major fights: He won a 10-round, non-title fight decision over former WBC bantamweight and future super bantamweight world champion Daniel Zaragoza, and he retained his IBF world championship with a TKO in round 14 over American Steve McCrory in a bout dubbed &quot;Olympic Revenge&quot; by Fenech&#x27;s then promoter Bill Mordy. McCrory, like Fenech, had competed in the flyweight division at the Los Angeles Olympics, winning the Gold Medal by defeating Redžep Redžepovski in the final. After the bout at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, McCrory graciously allowed the Australian to wear his Olympic Gold Medal to show off to the crowd. During the fight with McCrory, Fenech wore green and red trunks, the colours of the South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league team with their tough forward Mario Fenech (no relation) in his corner. McCrory was trained out of the Kronk Gym in Detroit.

===Super bantamweight champion===
1987 was a big year for Fenech. He went up in weight, and in his first fight as a super bantamweight, he defeated Tony Miller by a decision. Then the WBC super bantamweight champion, Samart Payakaroon, travelled to Australia to defend his belt against Fenech. Fenech became a two-weight world champion by knocking Payakaroon out in four rounds. For his next defense, he met future world bantamweight champion Greg Richardson and knocked him out in five. Next it was former WBC bantamweight champion Carlos Zarate&#x27;s turn to challenge Fenech. Fenech retained his crown by a technical decision win in four rounds at the Perth Entertainment Centre, and then finished his year by knocking out Osmar Avila in one round in a non-title affair.

===Featherweight champion===
By 1988, Fenech had grown into a featherweight, and the WBC matched him with Puerto Rico&#x27;s former world super bantamweight champion &quot;Victor Luvi Callejas&quot; for their vacant featherweight title, once again, in Sydney. Fenech joined boxing&#x27;s exclusive group of fighters who have been world champs in three or more divisions, by knocking Callejas out in the 11th round. He retained that title twice before the year was over, knocking out Tyrone Downes and Georgie &quot;Go Go&quot; Navarro, both in the fifth round.
In 1989, he beat Marcos Villasana and former Julio César Chávez challenger Mario Martinez, both by decision.

===Super featherweight title challenges===

After that, Fenech took one year off and came back in 1991 as a super featherweight. After beating Johnny Calhoun by a knockout in four, he tried to become a four division world champion when he met Azumah Nelson. The fight was fought on the undercard to the Mike Tyson vs Razor Ruddock rematch at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. After 12 ferocious rounds the bout was controversially declared a draw with many of the boxing press who were present (as well as Tyson) claiming that Fenech had been robbed of a clear win. Fenech has accused Nelson&#x27;s promoter Don King of fixing the fight: &quot;Him being Azumah Nelson and being under the Don King banner helped him because I believe the referee (Joe Cortez) didn’t let me do what I wanted to do, breaking up the fight, let Azumah hit me after the bell. People want to say I’m a dirty fighter but I only retaliate when someone does something to me. I’ve got no need to do something dirty at the start because I’m busy trying to cut the ring off and put pressure on. Like I said, although I won the fight, nobody tried to help me like that. The judging, the referring, everything was against me.&quot; On Monday 7 November 2022, a review of the fight by WBC Boxing retrospectively declared Fenech the winner, thus giving him a fourth world title.

Fenech returned to Australia and after beating Miguel Francia, Nelson travelled to Melbourne to offer Fenech a second title try. This time in front of over 30,000 fans at the Princes Park football stadium, Fenech suffered his first loss, when he was knocked out in the eighth round for Nelson to retain the world title. Fenech&#x27;s TKO loss was recognized as the Ring Magazine Upset of the Year.

After that fight, he fought sporadically. In 1993, he was beaten in seven rounds by knockout by American former IBF featherweight champion Calvin Grove at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, and in 1995, he beat Tialano Tovar, by a knockout in eight in New Jersey.

===Lightweight title challenge===
In 1996, in what was thought to have been his last fight (he fought Nelson a third time 12 years later), he lost to IBF lightweight champion Phillip Holiday of South Africa by a knockout in the second round. He retired after the bout.
Fenech retired with a record of 28 wins, 3 losses and 1 draw, with 21 wins by knockout.

==Post-retirement career==
Fenech was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986.

In retirement, Fenech has kept busy, and now he is the owner of a sports clothing brand that carries his name in Australia. In addition, he was inducted in 2002 into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York. Fenech has become a trainer training fighters such as Danny Green, Nedal Hussein, Hussein Hussein, Sakio Bika, and former IBF flyweight champion Vic Darchinyan.
On 5 January 2004, Fenech was attacked and stabbed by four men in Sydney, receiving facial cuts that required plastic surgery.

In June of the same year, the Fenech family home was attacked by shooters; seven bullets were recovered but no one was injured. Australian police believed the two attacks against Fenech are connected, ranging from a bar fight that Fenech had with a gang-member in 2003. &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper quoted someone related to a Lebanese gang stating that &quot;they will get him&quot;, but Fenech does not believe that the violent events are related.
In March 2005, Fenech became the trainer for former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, in an effort to relaunch Tyson&#x27;s career.

During the year 2020, Fenech trained Mike Tyson once again in preparation for Tyson&#x27;s exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr.

Despite repeated denials made in the popular press and on his website, Fenech pleaded guilty to his role in the 2005 theft of 3 gold watches worth a total of $327 from a Gold Coast, Queensland boutique store. There was clear evidence of his involvement from in-store security cameras, revealing that Fenech actively participated in the incident.
===Boxing comeback against Nelson===
In March 2008, Fenech – at age 43 – announced a comeback to professional boxing and lost 22 kilos in preparation for the fight. He was to fight Azumah Nelson (who was 49 years old by this time) in what was later built up as the grudge match of the century. The two were to do battle on 24 June 2008 in Melbourne, Australia. A reality series/documentary on Fenech&#x27;s life aired on Channel 9 and Fox Sports in the weeks leading up to the fight. On 24 June 2008, Fenech won the grudge match against Azumah Nelson by a majority decision, one judge scoring the fight a draw and the last two judges scoring it in favour of Fenech.
In June 2008, Fenech won the Shane Warne 888 Poker World Series of Poker Celebrity Bounty Event at Crown Casino. Fenech now appears at poker events around the world including the Aussie Millions and the World Series of Poker.

<text>The Airbus A310 is a wide-body aircraft, designed and manufactured by Airbus Industrie GIE, then a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers.

Airbus had identified a demand for an aircraft smaller than the A300, the first twin-jet wide-body. On 7 July 1978, the A310 (initially the A300B10) was launched with orders from Swissair and Lufthansa. On 3 April 1982, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, and the A310 received its type certificate on 11 March 1983.
Keeping the same eight-abreast cross-section, the A310 is shorter than the initial A300 variants, and has a smaller wing, down from . The A310 introduced a two-crew glass cockpit, later adopted for the A300-600 with a common type rating. It was powered by the same General Electric CF6-80 or Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D then PW4000 turbofan jet engines. It can seat 220 passengers in two classes, or 240 in all-economy, and has a flying range up to . It has overwing exits between the two main front and rear door pairs.
In April 1983, the aircraft entered revenue service with Swissair, and competed with the Boeing 767-200, introduced six months before. Its longer range and ETOPS regulations allowed it to be operated on transatlantic flights.
Until the last delivery in June 1998, 255 aircraft were produced, as it was succeeded by the larger Airbus A330-200. It was available as a cargo aircraft version, and was also developed into a military variant, the A310 MRTT multi-role transport, then tanker.

== Development ==
=== Background ===
On 26 September 1967, the governments of France, West Germany and the United Kingdom signed a memorandum of understanding to commence the joint development of the 300-seat Airbus A300. The French and West Germans reached a firm agreement on 29 May 1969, after the British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969. This collaborative effort between the two states resulted in the production of the consortium&#x27;s first airliner, known as the &quot;Airbus A300&quot;. The A300 was a wide-body medium-to-long range passenger airliner; it holds the distinction of being the first twin-engine wide-body aircraft in the world. The design was relatively revolutionary for its time, and featured a number of industry firsts, making the first use of composite materials on a commercial aircraft; during 1977, the A300 became the first ETOPS-compliant aircraft, which was made possible due to its high performance and safety standards. The A300 would be produced in a range of models, and sold relatively well to airlines across the world, eventually reaching a total of 816 delivered aircraft during its production life.

During the development of the earlier A300, a range of different aircraft size and capacity were studied by the consortium; the resulting Airbus A300B proposal was one of the smaller options. When the A300B1 prototypes emerged, a number of airlines issued requests for an aircraft with greater capacity, which resulted in the initial production A300B2 version. As the A300 entered service, it became increasingly apparent that there was also a sizeable market for a smaller aircraft; some operators did not have enough traffic to justify the relatively large A300, while others wanted more frequency or lower aircraft-distance costs at the expense of higher seat-distance cost (specifically Swissair and Lufthansa). At the same time, there was great pressure for Airbus to validate itself beyond the design and manufacture of a single airliner. In response to these desires, Airbus explored the options for producing a smaller derivative of the A300B2.

=== Design effort ===

In order to minimise the associated research and development costs for the tentative project, Airbus chose to examine several early design studies performed during the A300 programme. The company ultimately chose to prioritise its focus on one option, which became known as the &quot;A300B10MC&quot; (standing for &quot;M&quot;inimum &quot;C&quot;hange). As envisioned, the airliner&#x27;s capacity was reduced to a maximum of 220 passengers, which was viewed at the time as being a desired capacity amongst many airlines. However, such a design would have resulted in a relatively small fuselage being mated to a comparatively large wing and oversized undercarriage; such an arrangement would have, amongst other things, made the aircraft consume an unnecessarily larger amount of fuel as it carried heavier weight than what was otherwise required.

Another problem for the programme was presented in the form of inflation, the rate of which in the United Kingdom (one of the early members of the Airbus consortium) was around 35 per cent during 1979–80. This factor was responsible for significantly raising the program&#x27;s development costs and, as a knock-on effect, increase the per-unit cost of the resulting airliner. During the development of the A300, British manufacturer Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) had been appointed as the subcontractor to perform the manufacturing of the wing of the aircraft; shortly afterwards, the British government chose to withdraw from the newly formed venture during 1969. In 1977, HSA subsequently merged with three other British aircraft companies, resulting in the formation of British Aerospace (BAe). By this point in time, the British government had publicly indicated its intentions to rejoin the Airbus programme. In May 1976, the French government entered into a series of discussions on cooperation, during which its representatives stated that the placing of an order by British Airways (BA) was a condition for the re-admission of the United Kingdom into Airbus Industrie as a full partner.

However, both BA and Rolls-Royce had not relinquished their will to collaborate with the Americans in future aircraft endeavours and, in BA&#x27;s case, procure American aircraft. During the late 1970s, BA sought to purchase two separate types of aircraft in development by American company Boeing, initially known as the &quot;7N7&quot; and &quot;7X7&quot;, which would develop into the 757 and 767, the latter of which being an intended rival to the upcoming A310, as well as the existing Boeing 747. Independent of the British government, BAe commenced its own dialogue between itself and American aircraft manufacturers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, for the purpose of assessing if BAe could participate in any of their future programmes, although the company&#x27;s chairman, Lord Beswick, publicly stated that the overall aim of the firm was to pursue collaboration in Europe. At the 1978 Farnborough Air Show, Eric Varley, the British Secretary of State for Industry, announced that BAe was to rejoin Airbus Industrie and participate as a full partner from 1 January 1979 onwards. Under the negotiated arrangement, BAe would be allocated a 20 per cent shareholding in Airbus Industrie, and would perform &quot;a full part in the development and manufacturing of the A310&quot;.

From late 1977, prior to the Varley announcement, BAe had already commenced work on the design of the new wing at its facility in Hatfield. However, due to negotiations with Britain on its return to the Airbus consortium being protracted, alternative options were explored, including potentially manufacturing the wing elsewhere. At the same time as the British efforts, French aerospace firm Aérospatiale, German aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB), and Dutch-German joint venture company VFW-Fokker were also conducting their individual studies into possible options for the wing of the prospective airliner.

=== Programme launch ===
At the April 1978 Hanover Air Show, Airbus exhibited a model of the proposed A310. Its wing area, at was slightly larger than that studied, at ; its passenger cabin was twelve frames shorter than the A300, accommodating typical passenger loads of 195 in two-class, or 245 in all-economy. However, during the next twelve months, almost every aspect was further refined. On 9 June 1978, Swissair and Lufthansa developed a joint specification for the aircraft, and within a month, announced that they would place the launch orders. On 15 March, Swissair became the first airline to place a firm order for the type, announcing that it would acquire ten aircraft, with a further ten under option, to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-9s on its major intra-European routes. Lufthansa was quick to place a $240 million ten-aircraft order; additional orders from French operator Air France and Spanish airline Iberia shortly followed.

Increasingly strong interest in the tentative airliner, coupled with the recovery of the industry during the late 1970s, contributed to Airbus deciding to put the A310 into production on 7 July 1978. During the latter half of 1978, an order for ten A300s was placed by independent British airline Laker Airways, satisfying Airbus&#x27;s demand for the placing of a British order for their aircraft. On 1 April 1979, Lufthansa decided to raise its commitment for the type to 25 aircraft, along with 25 options. Two days later, Dutch operator KLM signed its order for ten aircraft and ten options at £238 million. On 6 July 1979, Air France announced that it had raised its order from four to thirty-five airliners. Other airlines announcing orders for the A310 during 1979 included Martinair, Sabena, and Air Afrique.

Initially, a pair of distinct versions of the A310 had been planned by Airbus; the regional A310-100, and the transcontinental A310-200. The A310-100 featured a range of with 200 passengers, whilst the A310-200 possessed a higher MTOW and centre section fuel, being able to carry the same load a further . Basic engines offered for the type included the General Electric CF6-45B2 and Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7R4. At one point, British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was openly considering offering an engine for the A310, the Rolls-Royce RB.207, however, it ultimately chose to discard such efforts in favour of a smaller three-spool design, the RB.211.

=== Entry into service ===
The range of the A310 exceeds that of the A300 series, with the exception of the A300-600R, which in turn surpasses that of the A310-200. The greater range of the A310 contributed to the airliner being used extensively by operators on transatlantic routes. The A300 and A310 introduced the concept of commonality: A300-600 and A310 pilots can cross-qualify for the other aircraft with one day of training.

Sales of the A310 continued through the early 1980s. On 3 April 1982, the prototype A310-200 airliner conducted its maiden flight; by this point, the type had accumulated a combined orders and options for 181 aircraft, which had been placed by fifteen airlines worldwide, which was a better start than the original A300. The launch customer of A310, Swissair, became the launch operator in April 1983. Over time, it had become clear that the longer-range series −200 aircraft was the more popular of the two models on offer. During 1979, in response to the lack of demand for the A310-100, Airbus decided to stop offering the lower gross weight model which had been originally proposed for Lufthansa; as a consequence, none of this variant were ultimately manufactured.

=== Sales and production end ===
During the early 1990s, demand for the aircraft began to slacken; there were no new A310 passenger orders placed during the late 1990s, in part due to the introduction of the newer and more advanced Airbus A330 during this time. As a result, on June 15, 1998, the last delivery of an A310 (msn. 706, reg.UK-31003) was made to Uzbekistan Airways. The A310, along with its A300 stablemate, officially ceased production during July 2007, though an order from Iraqi Airways for five A310s had remained on the books until July 2008. The remaining freighter sales were to be instead fulfilled by the new A330-200F derivative.

The A310 had been commonly marketed as an introduction to wide-body operations for airlines based in developing countries. The airliner was replaced in Airbus&#x27; range by the highly successful A330-200, which shares its fuselage cross-section. Between 1983, and the last aircraft produced in 1998, 255 A310s were delivered. The A300 and A310 established Airbus as a competitor to Boeing, and allowed it to go ahead with the more ambitious A320, and A330 / A340 families.

, thirty-seven A310s remain in commercial service; major operators are Air Transat and Mahan Air with nine aircraft each; Fedex Express (six), and seven other airlines operating thirteen aircraft between them.

The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) currently operates a fleet of five Airbus CC-150 Polaris, civilian Airbus A310-300s, originally owned by Wardair, and subsequently Canadian Airlines International, after the airlines merged. The aircraft were then sold to the Canadian government, and have been converted for use as the primary long-distance transport aircraft as part of the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s fleet of Royal Canadian Air Force VIP aircraft.

As of January 2025, only 33 remain in service, with 22 being ACJs, 8 being in passenger service (with Ariana Afghan Airlines(3), Iran Air (1), Iran Airtour (4) being the only remaining passenger operators) and 3 in cargo service (UPS Airlines).

== Design ==


The Airbus A310 was a medium- to long-range twin-engined wide-body jet airliner. Initially a derivative of the A300, the aircraft had originally been designated the &quot;A300B10&quot;. It was essentially a shortened variant of the earlier aircraft; however, there were considerable differences between the two aircraft. Specifically, the fuselage possessed the same cross-section, but being shorter than the A300, it provided capacity for a typical maximum of 200 passengers. The rear fuselage was heavily re-designed, featuring altered tapering, while involved a move aft of the rear bulkhead to create additional capacity; this same design change was later transferred back to later variants of the A300, such as the A300-600 and A330/A340 fuselages. The A310 also had a different emergency exit configuration, consisting of four main doors (two at the front and two at the rear of the aircraft), and two smaller doors over the wings.

The wing of the A310 was redesigned, possessing a reduced span and wing area, and incorporating simpler single-slotted Fowler flaps designed by British Aerospace shortly following its decision to join the Airbus consortium. Other changes to the wing included the elimination of the outer ailerons, which were occasionally referred to by the manufacturer as being &quot;low speed ailerons&quot;, and the addition of electrically actuated spoilers. The wing also featured common pylons, which were able to support all types of engines that were offered to customers to power the airliner. From 1985 onwards, the A310-300 introduced wingtip fences which reduced vortex drag and thus improved cruise fuel consumption by over 1.5%. A limited number of alterations were also performed to the airliner&#x27;s tail unit, such as the adoption of smaller horizontal tail surfaces.

The A310 was furnished with a two-crew glass cockpit configuration as standard, removing the requirement for a flight engineer; Airbus referred to this concept as the &quot;Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit&quot;. The company had developed the cockpit to significantly enhance the aircraft&#x27;s man-machine interface, thereby improving operational safety. It was outfitted with an array of six computer-based cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays to provide the flight crew with centralised navigational, warning, monitoring, and general flight information, in place of the more traditional analogue instrumentation and dials, which were used in conjunction with a range of modern electronic systems. The same flight deck was incorporated into the A300-600, a move which increased commonality between the two types, and enabled a dual type rating to be achieved, this same approach was later used on many future Airbus aircraft. In addition to the two flying crew, provisions for third and fourth crew seats were present within the flight deck.

The A310 was initially proposed with a choice of three engines: the General Electric CF6-80A1, the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7R4D1, and the Rolls-Royce RB211-524. The A310 was launched with the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7R4D1 or the General Electric CF6-80A3. Subsequently available were the CF6-80C2A2 or the PW4152. From late 1991 the higher thrust CF6-80C2A8 or PW4156A became available.

The A310 was equipped with a modified undercarriage, derived from the A300; the landing gear were outfitted with carbon brakes, which were fitted as standard. The structure of the airliner featured a high level of composite materials throughout both primary and secondary structures, increased beyond that of the earlier A300. The A310 is outfitted with integrated drive electrical generators along with auxiliary power unit, which were improved versions of those used on the A300.

== Variants ==
The A310 is available in two basic versions, the medium range -200 and the longer range -300. The first version of the aircraft to be developed was the −200, but this was later joined by the -300, which then became the standard production version of the aircraft. The short range -100 variant was never developed due to low demand.

=== A310-200 ===
:The first A310, the 162nd Airbus off the production line, made its maiden flight on 3 April 1982 powered by the earlier Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7R4D1 engines. The -200 entered service with Swissair and Lufthansa a year later. Late series -200 also featured wing fences identical to those of the -300. The first three A310s were initially fitted with outboard ailerons; they were later removed once testing showed them to be unnecessary. Production of the A310-200 ended in 1988.

=== A310-200C ===
:A convertible version, the seats can be removed and cargo placed on the main deck, the A310-200C entered service with Martinair on 29 November 1984.

=== A310-200F ===

:The freight version of the A310-200 was available as a new build, or as a conversion of existing wide-bodied aircraft. The A310-200F freighter can carry of freight for . No production freighters of the A310-200F were produced. The converted Airbus A310-200F entered service with FedEx Express in 1994.

=== A310-300 ===
:First flown on 8 July 1985, the −300 is dimensionally identical to the −200, although it provides an increased Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) and an increase in range, provided by additional centre and horizontal stabiliser (trim-tank) fuel tanks. This model also introduced wingtip fences to improve aerodynamic efficiency, a feature that has since been retrofitted to some −200s. The aircraft entered service in 1986 with Swissair. The A310-300 incorporates a computerised fuel distribution system which allows it to be trimmed in flight, optimising the centre of gravity by shuttling up to of fuel in and out of the horizontal stabiliser tank, controlled by the Centre of Gravity Control Computer.

=== A310-300C ===
: it can be easily converted to passenger or cargo version, the seats can be removed and cargo placed on the main deck.

=== A310-300F ===
:The freight version of the A310-300F. Operators such as FedEx Express acquired modified ex-passenger A310s, usually starting with the −300 version. No production freighters of the A310-300F were produced.

=== A310 MRT/MRTT ===

:The A310 has been operated by several air forces as a pure transport, the A310-300 MRT Multi-Role Transport. However several have now been converted to the A310 MRTT Multi-Role Tanker Transport configuration by EADS, providing an air-to-air refuelling capability. At least six have been completed; four by the German Air Force (Luftwaffe), and two by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Deliveries began in 2004. Three were converted at EADS EFW in Dresden, Germany; the other three at Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg, Germany.

=== A310 Zero G ===
:One A310 airframe became a scientific research laboratory dedicated to weightlessness. This reduced-gravity aircraft is used to realise parabolas, allowing to perform twenty-two seconds of weightlessness. Operated by , subsidiary of CNES, French Space Agency, A310 Zero G is based at Bordeaux Mérignac airport. It also performs scientific flights and movie special effects, such as for &quot;The Mummy&quot; (2017).

== Accidents and incidents ==
As of September 2015 there have been 12 hull-loss accidents involving A310s with a total of 825 fatalities; and 9 hijackings with a total of five fatalities.

=== Accidents with fatalities ===
*31 July 1992: Thai Airways International Flight 311, an A310-304 carrying 99 passengers and 14 crew, crashed on approach to Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu. All 113 on board were killed.
*23 March 1994: Aeroflot Flight 593, an A310-304 carrying 63 passengers and 12 crew, crashed in Siberia after the pilot let his son sit at the controls and the autopilot partially disconnected. All 75 on board were killed.
*31 March 1995: TAROM Flight 371, an A310-324 carrying 49 passengers and 11 crew, crashed near Otopeni International Airport, Bucharest, Romania after the throttle on the starboard engine jammed with no subsequent resolution by the pilots, at the same time as the captain suffered a medical crisis. All 60 on board were killed.
*11 December 1998: Thai Airways International Flight 261 crashed near Surat Thani Airport in Thailand. There were 101 fatalities and 45 survived with serious injuries.
*30 January 2000: Kenya Airways Flight 431, an A310-300 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean shortly after takeoff from Abidjan in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. 169 passengers and crew were killed and 10 passengers survived with serious injuries. This is the deadliest aviation accident involving the Airbus A310.
*9 July 2006: S7 Airlines Flight 778, an Airbus A310-324 from Moscow carrying 196 passengers and eight crew, overshot the runway at Irkutsk in Siberia, plowed through a concrete barrier and caught fire as it crashed into buildings. Reports said that 70 of the 204 on board survived, with 12 missing. Since the accident, casualty figures have fluctuated, in part due to three people boarding the aircraft who were not on the passenger manifest, and some survivors walking home after being assumed trapped in the wreckage.
*10 June 2008: Sudan Airways Flight 109, an A310-324 from Amman, Jordan carrying 203 passengers and 11 crew, ran off the runway while landing at Khartoum International Airport during bad weather. Soon afterward a fire started in the aircraft&#x27;s right wing area. A total of 30 people were killed.
*30 June 2009, Yemenia Flight 626, an A310-324, flying from Sana&#x27;a, Yemen, to Moroni, Comoros crashed into the Indian Ocean shortly before reaching its destination. The aircraft was carrying 153 passengers and crew; there was one survivor, a 14-year-old girl.
*24 June 2014, Pakistan International Airlines Flight 756, an Airbus A310-324ET, flying from King Khalid International Airport, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to Bacha Khan International Airport, Peshawar, Pakistan, was hit by ground gun fire killing one female and injuring two flight attendants.
* On 24 December 2015, at 08:35, an Airbus A310-304F cargo aircraft, registration 9Q-CVH, operated by Congolese company Services Air on a domestic flight, ran off the end of the runway and crashed in a residential area while landing at Mbuji-Mayi Airport in the city of Mbuji-Mayi, the capital of Kasai-Oriental province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Eight people were killed and nine others were injured.

=== Hijackings ===
*26 March 1991: Singapore Airlines Flight 117, registration 9V-STP, carrying 123 passengers and crew, was hijacked by 4 male Pakistanis en route to Singapore. The aircraft landed at Singapore safely where the Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation stormed it and killed the hijackers. Two occupants were injured during the process.
*4 September 1992: Vietnam Airlines Flight 850, registration LZ-JXB, leased from Jes Air, with 127 occupants on board en route from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City, hijacked by Ly Tong, a former pilot in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. He then dropped anti-communist leaflets over Ho Chi Minh City before parachuting out. Vietnamese security forces later arrested him on the ground. The aircraft landed safely, and no one on board was injured. Tong was incarcerated in a Hanoi prison, where he remained until 1998.
* On 11 February 1993, Lufthansa Flight 592, registration D-AIDM from Frankfurt to Addis Ababa via Cairo with 94 passengers and 10 crew members was hijacked during the first leg by 20-year-old Nebiu Zewolde Demeke, who forced the pilots to divert to the United States, with the intent of securing the right of asylum there. Demeke, who had been on the flight to be deported back to his native Ethiopia, surrendered to authorities upon arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. No passengers or crew members were harmed during the 12-hour ordeal.
*25 October 1993, Nigeria Airways Flight 470 was hijacked en route from Lagos to Abuja. The hijackers demanded the resignation of Nigeria&#x27;s government and to be flown to Frankfurt. The aircraft was denied permission to land in N&#x27;Djamena, and was diverted to the Niamey Airport for refuelling. It was stormed by Niger National Gendarmerie four days later; the co-pilot was killed during the operation.

=== Other incidents ===
* On 11 February 1991, an Interflug flight from Berlin to Moscow was involved in a go-around incident at Sheremetyevo International Airport. The captain of the A310 (registered D-AOAC) disagreed with the flight computer settings for the go-around, and the resulting opposite control inputs from the flight computer caused a total of four stalls, including one that pitched the aircraft up to 88 degrees (nearly vertical). The pilots eventually recovered control and landed the aircraft.
*On 24 September 1994, TAROM Flight 381, an Airbus A310 registered YR-LCA flying from Bucharest to Paris Orly, went into a sudden and uncommanded nose-up position and stalled. The crew attempted to countermand the aircraft&#x27;s flight control system but were unable to get the nose down while remaining on course. Witnesses saw the aircraft climb with an extreme nose-up attitude, then bank sharply left, then right, then fall into a steep dive. Only when the dive produced additional speed was the crew able to recover steady flight. An investigation found that an overshoot of flap placard speed during the approach, incorrectly commanded by the captain, caused a mode transition to flight level change. The auto-throttles increased power and trim went full nose-up as a result. The crew&#x27;s attempt at commanding the nose-down elevator could not counteract the effect of stabilizer nose-up trim, and the resulting dive brought the aircraft from a height of at the time of the stall to when the crew was able to recover command. The aircraft landed safely after a second approach. There were 186 people on board.
*12 July 2000: Hapag-Lloyd Flight 3378, an A310-304, crashed during an emergency landing near Vienna in Austria due to fuel exhaustion. All 143 passengers and 8 crew on board survived.
* On 6 March 2005, Air Transat Flight 961, an Airbus A310-308, en route from Cuba to Quebec City with nine crew and 261 passengers on board, experienced a structural failure in which the rudder detached in flight. The A310 experienced a sudden jolt, This is similar to Northwest Flight 85 due to a panel breaking off, Flight 85 landed in Anchorage Intl, Alaska. But in this situation, The aircraft returned to Varadero, Cuba, where they made a safe landing. The crew made no unusual rudder inputs during the flight nor was the rudder being manipulated when it failed; there was no obvious fault in the rudder or yaw-damper system. Subsequent investigation determined that Airbus&#x27; inspection procedure for the composite rudder was inadequate; inspection procedures for composite structures on airliners were changed following this accident.
*23 February 2006: A Mahan Air Airbus A310 operating a flight from Tehran, Iran, was involved in a serious incident while on approach to Birmingham International Airport. The aircraft descended to the published minimum descent altitude of despite still being from the runway threshold. At a point 6 nm from the runway the aircraft had descended to an altitude of , which was above ground level. Having noticed the descent profile, Birmingham air traffic control issued an immediate climb instruction to the aircraft, however, the crew had already commenced a missed approach, having received a GPWS alert. The aircraft was radar vectored for a second approach during which the flight crew again initiated an early descent. On this occasion, the radar controller instructed the crew to maintain their altitude and the crew completed the approach to a safe landing. The accident investigation determined that the primary cause was the use of the incorrect DME for the approach, combined with a substantial breakdown in the Crew Resource Management. Three safety recommendations were made.
*12 March 2007: Biman Bangladesh Airlines Flight 006, an A310-325 carrying 250 passengers and crew, suffered a collapsed nose gear during its takeoff run. There were no fatalities in the accident at Dubai International Airport. The aircraft came to rest at the end of the runway and was evacuated, but blocked the only active runway and forced the airport to close for nearly eight hours. The aircraft was written off.
*24 December 2015: A Mahan Air Airbus A310-300 operating a flight from Tehran (Iran) to Istanbul (Turkey) failed to stop at its stand at Istanbul&#x27;s Ataturk Airport, instead colliding with a concrete barrier and bus. The aircraft, registration EP-MNP, sustained substantial damage but was repaired and returned to service a year later. Another A310 crashed the same day and year.
*19 July 2023: a CC150 Polaris and crew were tasked to repatriate personnel and equipment from Exercise Mobility Guardian 23, a multinational Air Mobility exercise led by the United States at Anderson Air Force Base in Guam. The aircraft, operating under callsign Can Force 3149 (CFC3149), arrived in Guam at approximately 2145 LocalTime on 21 Jul 23 and was directed to parking by United States Air Force personnel. After shutting down, the crew carried out post flight checks as well as loading the aircraft with baggage and equipment for the return flight the following day. After completing their duties, the crew departed for the hotel at approximately 2300 Local Time. At approximately 1030 Local Time on 22 Jul 23, the unattended aircraft rolled backwards, followed a curved trajectory, and impacted a French Air and Space Force Airbus A400M parked on an adjacent spot. The impact resulted in serious damage to both aircraft, but no injuries. The investigation revealed the aircraft to be serviceable prior to the accident. A lack of installed chocks allowed the aircraft to roll from its position after the parking brake reached its designed holding period of 12 hours. Expectation bias, crew fatigue and checklist design contributed to chocks not being installed as well as the crew not detecting the lack of chocks prior to leaving the aircraft. The investigation recommends changes to checklists, availability of fatigue prediction software for planning, and a review of the Fatigue Assessment Report.

<text>Jacobo Timerman (6 January 1923 – 11 November 1999) was a Soviet-born Argentine publisher, journalist, and author, who is most noted for his confronting and reporting the atrocities of the Argentine military regime&#x27;s Dirty War during a period of widespread repression in which an estimated 30,000 political prisoners were disappeared. He was persecuted, tortured and imprisoned by the Argentine junta in the late 1970s and was exiled in 1979 with his wife to Israel. He was widely honored for his work as a journalist and publisher.

In Israel, Timerman wrote and published his most well-known book, &quot;Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number&quot; (1981), a memoir of his prison experience that added to his international reputation. A longtime Zionist, he also published &quot;The Longest War&quot;, a strongly critical book about Israel&#x27;s 1982 Lebanon War.

Timerman returned to Argentina in 1984, and testified to the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons. He continued to write, publishing books in 1987 about Chile under the Augusto Pinochet regime and in 1990 about Cuba under Fidel Castro.

==Early life==
Timerman was born in Bar, Ukraine, to Jewish parents Eve Berman and Nathan Timerman. To escape the persecution of Jews and pogroms there, the family emigrated to Argentina in 1928, when he was five years old and his brother Joseph was seven. The family lived in the Jewish area of Buenos Aires, restricted by their poverty to occupying a single room. Timerman took a job at age 12 after the death of his father. While young, Timerman lost an eye due to infection.

Timerman became a Zionist as a young man. He met his future wife, Risha Mindlin, at a Zionist conference in Mendoza. (Her surname has also been reported as Midlin.) They married on 20 May 1950 in a simple ceremony at the Mindlin house.

==Career==
===Journalist and publisher===
Timerman gained work as a journalist and rose in his profession, reporting for various publications including the &quot;Agence France-Presse,&quot; &quot;Mail,&quot; &quot;What,&quot; &quot;News Charts,&quot; &quot;New Zion,&quot; and &quot;Commentary.&quot; He became fluent in English as well as Spanish. He gained experience and reported on Argentine and South American politics.

In 1962, Timerman founded &quot;Primera Plana&quot;, an Argentine news-weekly often compared to the American publication, &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In 1964 Timerman resigned as editor of &quot;Primera Plana,&quot; amid rumors of official threats due to his &quot;line of opposition to the government&quot;. The magazine announced Timerman&#x27;s resignation the week after it had reported on government threats to sanction uncooperative publications.

In 1965, he founded another news weekly titled &quot;Confirmado&quot; (&quot;The Journal&quot;).

The Armed Forces seized power in 1966, overthrowing president Arturo Illia. General Juan Carlos Onganía was installed as president, initiating a repressive and unpopular regime. His administration was characterized by its violent repression of Argentina&#x27;s universities and intellectuals, and for its policy of establishing strict and conservative Catholic morals. Onganía suspended publication of &quot;Primera Plana&quot; in 1969. The next year it resumed publication but never regained its previous status. From his exile in Spain, former president Juan Perón bought Timerman&#x27;s newspaper in 1970, planning to control it and part of the political discussion in the country.

Timerman founded &quot;La Opinión&quot; in 1971, which many considered &quot;the greatest of his career. With it, Timerman began to cover topics in more depth and journalists signed their articles, so their work could be identified. His model was the French newspaper, &quot;Le Monde.&quot;

On 27 July 1972, the 20th anniversary of Eva Perón&#x27;s death, terrorists set off 20 bombs in Argentina, most located in banks. But Timerman was one of numerous people targeted in the 20 attempted bombings.

Perón returned to Argentina from Spain in 1973 after his candidate Héctor Cámpora of the Justicialist Party was elected as president. Perón was widely understood to be the real power in the country, and the next year was elected as president after Campora stepped aside for him. His third wife, Isabel Perón, was elected as his vice-president. His death in 1974 raised uncertainty and political tensions. Isabel Perón succeeded him, becoming the first woman president in the Western Hemisphere. During the political unrest that year, Timerman received bomb threats by the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance (also called the Triple A).

===&quot;La Opinión&quot;===
From 1971 to 1977, Timerman edited and published the left-leaning daily &quot;La Opinión&quot;. Under his leadership, this paper reported news and criticisms of the human rights violations of the Argentine government, into the early years of the Dirty War. One wealthy backer of the paper was David Graiver, a Jewish businessman said to have ties to the leftist guerrilla group known as Montoneros, which was banned. Graiver had lent money to the paper in 1974. Because of Graiver&#x27;s alleged ties to the Montoneros, Timerman was later criticized for his connections to the businessman.

The publisher reported against both left-wing and right-wing terrorism. Some commentators have suggested that he supported a military coup to quell the violence. Timerman believed that his paper was the only one that dared to report accurately on current affairs without hiding the events behind euphemisms. Both Isabel Perón and the military regime that overthrew her government suspended the paper for short periods prior to Timerman&#x27;s arrest. Timerman later wrote in &quot;Prisoner Without a Name&quot; (1981), &quot;During my journalistic career, particularly as publisher and editor of &quot;La Opinión&quot;, I received countless threats&quot;. For example:

One morning two letters arrived in the same mail: one was from the rightist terrorist organization (protected and utilized by paramilitary groups) condemning me to death because of its belief that my militancy on behalf of the right to trial for anyone arrested and my battle for human rights were hindrances in overthrowing communism; the other letter was from the terrorist Trotskyite group, &quot;Ejercito Revolucionario Popular&quot; (ERP)—the Popular Revolutionary Army—and indicated that if I continued accusing leftist revolutionaries of being Fascists and referring to them as the lunatic Left, I would be tried and most likely sentenced to death.

Timerman maintained his outspoken support for Israel. In 1975, in response to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which condemned Zionism as racism (as well as condemning South Africa&#x27;s apartheid), he wrote &quot;Why I Am A Zionist&quot;. (Originally passed largely by Non-aligned Nations following their conference that year, the resolution was revoked in 1991 by with UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86.)

===1976 military coup===
A coup in 1976 installed General Jorge Rafael Videla and began &quot;el Proceso&quot;— military rule, including widespread persecution that came to be known as Argentina&#x27;s &quot;Dirty War&quot;. Timerman like many others had initially supported a military takeover, on the grounds that it might curb the country&#x27;s pervasive violence.

Timerman continued to publish &quot;La Opinión&quot; for a year after the coup. He later speculated that moderates within the military had kept the paper alive because &quot;the continued existence of &quot;La Opinión&quot; was a credit abroad; it backed the philosophy of future national reconstruction, it upheld the thesis of national unity, and was committed on a daily basis to curbing extremist excesses.&quot; The precise position of (and divisions within) the new government regarding Timerman and his paper, remains unknown.

Anti-semitism increased during the 1970s as right-wing factions became more powerful. Jews were targeted in the media, including television stations operated by the government. A book called &quot;Plan Andinia&quot;, published anonymously in 1977, warned of an international Zionist conspiracy to control part of Argentina.

Anti-semitic bombings also increased, to a frequency of ten per month in 1976. Police defused bombs placed outside of &quot;La Opinión&quot; headquarters during a wave of antisemitic violence in August of that year. An enormous bomb detonated in early 1977, at a screening of &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot; (a pro-Israel film) in Córdoba, which damaged almost 80 businesses.

At the beginning of April, the military began to arrest people connected to the Argentine banker David Graiver, who had left the country in 1975 and was reported killed in a plane accident in Mexico in 1976. He had been under suspicion of financing the left-wing Montoneros guerrillas through money laundering of millions of dollars derived from their kidnapping ransoms. Reports suggest that between 100 and 300 people were arrested under this charge.

==Arrest==
Before dawn on 15 April 1977, military police in civilian clothes appeared at Timerman&#x27;s house and took him into custody. Enrique Jara, assistant editor of &quot;La Opinion&quot;, was also arrested. The Army announced that Timerman and Jara were being held, with 13 others, &quot;in relation to the investigation of the Graiver case&quot;. The same day, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it had become involved in the case, and was hunting for Graiver under suspicion that his death had been faked. The military promoted the story of a Graiver conspiracy in the national and international press. For instance, a 17 April column in &quot;La Nación&quot; promised sweeping prosecution and punishment for all those involved.

On 25 May 1977, the government appointed General José Teófilo Goyret as the &quot;interventor&quot; (military supervisor) of &quot;La Opinión&quot;. Goyret later allowed the paper, worth $5,000,000, to quietly fold.

==Prison and torture==
Timerman later testified:
After arresting me at my home in the federal capital, they took me to the police headquarters of Buenos Aires Province where I was interrogated by Camps and Etchecolatz; from there they transferred me to Campo de Mayo, where they made me sign a statement. Then they left me at Puesto Vasco, where I was tortured, after which I was again turned over to the Central Department of the Federal Police, where after 25 days I was able to get in touch with my family. From there they took me to COT-I Martínez to be tortured again, then again to the Central Department of the Federal Police. Ultimately, I was legally interned at the Magdalena penitentiary.

Both Ramón Camps and Miguel Etchecolatz were later indicted and convicted for their involvement in widespread torture and &quot;disappearances&quot; during the Dirty War. The kidnapping and detention of Timerman were found to have been ordered by General Guillermo Suárez Mason and his &quot;Batallón de Inteligencia&quot; 601. The three leaders were pardoned in 1991 by President Carlos Menem.

Timerman wrote later that he was arrested by &quot;the extremist sector of the army&quot;, which &quot;was also the heart of Nazi operations in Argentina&quot;. He said his captors accused him of involvement in the &quot;Andinia Plan&quot; (the alleged Zionist conspiracy to control part of Argentina). Timerman believed that these jailers spared his life because they saw him as a potentially crucial source of information about the plan. The guards also interrogated Timerman about his relationship to the late banker David Graiver. Timerman was subjected to electric shock torture, beatings, and solitary confinement.

===Acquittal and house arrest===
Timerman was acquitted by a military court in October 1977. The military continued to accuse him of &quot;failure to observe basic moral principles in the exercise of public, political, or union offices&quot;. Rumors emerged on 30 March 1978 that the junta had decided to change Timerman&#x27;s status. On 17 April 1978, he was officially released from prison but placed under permanent house arrest at his residence on Ayucucho Street.

At one point, soon after Patt Derian (US Secretary for Human Rights) had prodded Videla about the case, Timerman was summoned to appear before the Minister of the Interior. He asked why he was being held. The minister said: &quot;You admitted to being a Zionist, and this point was revealed at a meeting of all the generals.&quot;

Timerman said: &quot;But being a Zionist is not forbidden.&quot;

The Minister replied: &quot;No, it isn&#x27;t forbidden, but on the other hand it isn&#x27;t a clearcut issue. Besides, you admitted to it. And the generals are aware of this.&quot;

===Reactions to his imprisonment===
Timerman became the single most famous Argentine political prisoner of the Dirty War. His wife, Risha, helped to raise international awareness about his imprisonment. Within the Argentine press, only the &quot;Buenos Aires Herald&quot; (written in English) covered Timerman&#x27;s arrest. &quot;Herald&quot; editor Robert Cox was later arrested and imprisoned.

====Jewish Argentine establishment====
Authorities among the Jewish community in Argentina were notably quiet about Timerman&#x27;s arrest. While some leaders were friends of the publisher, their institutions, particularly &quot;el Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas de Argentina&quot; (DAIA), stayed relatively quiet on the topic.

According to Jacobo&#x27;s brother, José:

The Jewish organizations took a passive approach, which amazed me, considering Jacobo’s systematic struggle against antisemitism and what happened during the Holocaust and so many other massacres suffered by the Jewish people throughout their history. I remember once I had a two-hour-long meeting with the executive board of the DAIA to ask it to undertake some kind of action in defense of my brother. But it was useless.In April 1978, the DAIA finally issued a statement approving the government&#x27;s shift of Timerman from prison to house arrest.

====Israel====
The reluctance of the Jewish establishment in Argentina to defend Timerman added to Israel&#x27;s difficulties in choosing a way to respond to the political crisis in the country. As an Israeli ambassador wrote after the fact, &quot;the leaders are offended because Timmerman is accusing them of behaving like the &quot;Judenrat&quot;, and the publication of the announcement [of an award] seems to lend credence to an accusation of this kind, so they do not like it at all&quot;.

The Israeli government maintained diplomatic ties and arms sales to the Argentine regime during this period, despite the Carter Administration&#x27;s end to US weapons transfers under the Kennedy-Humphrey Amendment. Appeals from the Argentine Jewish community, which was disproportionately targeted in the Dirty War, were generally ignored by the Israeli government. The Knesset prohibited discussion on this topic.

Yet Timerman&#x27;s high-profile arrest, particularly in light of his known Zionist affiliations, elicited a diplomatic response from Israel. According to historian Raanan Rein and journalist Efraim Davidi, 
&quot;Israel&#x27;s official policy can be described as an effort to show the junta that it had committed a serious error in arresting the journalist but to avoid rousing international public opinion against the regime and, even more important, to avoid attributing antisemitic proclivities to the leaders of the dictatorship.&quot; The Israeli government secretly pressured Argentina to free Timerman, but did not make public demands as it did on behalf of Jews in the Soviet Union.

Yishayahu Anug, director-general of Israel&#x27;s Foreign Ministry, wrote: 
&quot;I would say not that Timerman is crucial for us but rather that we are crucial for his release. It is not an emotional issue but one of cool judgment. The formula consists in creating the sense that his release is vital for Argentina&#x27;s image and also for Israel and the positive development of our relations with them.&quot;As part of this approach, Israeli diplomats sought to downplay press coverage of Timerman&#x27;s imprisonment.

According to a 2001 account by Timerman&#x27;s son Héctor, Israeli Ambassador Ram Nirgad and the American-Argentine rabbi Marshall Meyer visited the Timerman house. Nirgad asked Timerman to sign a letter saying that he was well treated and had no problems with the government. The journalist refused and said he&#x27;d rather remain in detention.

After the failure of Nirgad&#x27;s initial efforts to achieve Timerman&#x27;s release, through conversations with Videla and others, Israel sought to add pressure by proxy. Anug&#x27;s new plan solicited the quiet assistance of anti-communist diplomats and authors in other nations. Not much progress had been made before Timerman was released in 1979.

====United States====
Timerman condemned Henry Kissinger (Nixon&#x27;s National Security Advisor) for supporting the military regime, even after President Jimmy Carter took office. Carter raised his administration&#x27;s concerns about human rights in Argentina publicly when General Videla visited Washington DC in November 1977 to sign the Panama Canal Treaties. Rep. Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts visited Timerman in early 1978, subsequently calling for his release and characterizing his imprisonment as a human rights issue.

As part of a broad change in foreign policy based around human rights, the United States Carter Administration in 1978 had condemned Argentina&#x27;s activities. In doing so, it reversed the position of the preceding Nixon Administration, which had supported the 1976 military coup.

While Timerman was still detained under house arrest in 1979, Patricia Derian, the US Secretary for Human Rights, reported that the Argentine human rights situation had improved.

In August 1979, a group of 18 US Congresspeople spoke out on Timerman&#x27;s behalf. These included Chris Dodd, John H. Rousselot, Gus Yatron, Benjamin Stanley Rosenthal, Henry Waxman, and Gladys Spellman, who compared the situation in Argentina to the Nazi Holocaust.

Several commentators have credited the Timerman case and his 1981 memoir with raising awareness of human rights abuses in South America with an otherwise apathetic United States audience.

====Other powers====

The Soviet Union also maintained ties with Argentina&#x27;s government during this period, and the nations had trade relations. Diplomatic relations were not particularly strong, as Videla opposed communism and considered Argentina to be part of a general alliance with Israel against the USSR.

==1978 World Cup==
The 1978 FIFA World Cup took place in Argentina, providing publicity to both the military regime and its opponents. The government sought to engineer a win for its team by any means necessary. Timerman later said that Argentine dissidents all rooted for the Dutch football team, out of appreciation for the Netherlands&#x27; efforts to counteract the regime&#x27;s self-promotion.

==Release and exile==
On 19 September 1979, the Argentine Supreme Court of Justice responded to a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition and ordered Timerman&#x27;s immediate release. On 20 September, the government held a large secret meeting to decide its response. Some military leaders wanted to disobey the ruling, but President Videla and others threatened resignation, insisting on Timerman&#x27;s release. On 25 September, the Foreign Ministry confirmed that Israel would accept Timerman. His Argentine citizenship was revoked, and he was placed on a flight to Madrid, en route to Israel. One of the escorting Israelis, Pinhas Avivi, advised Timerman to remain quiet about his imprisonment. He disregarded this advice and gave a press conference by telephone as soon as he landed in Madrid. He traveled to Israel, arriving in time for Yom Kippur. His wife and three sons also moved to Israel.

==Israel==
Upon arriving in Israel, Timerman took up residence in Ramat Aviv (a neighborhood of Tel Aviv). He was given Israeli citizenship. The military had confiscated all his assets in Argentina, but he still owned a summer home in Uruguay, which he sold.

He made an agreement with &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot; to write six articles on his imprisonment. These were to be syndicated internationally. Timerman was dissuaded from publishing the articles by Foreign Ministry director Yosef Chechanover. He met with him in October 1979 and argued that an exposé would endanger &quot;disappeared&quot; Jews and their families in Argentina.

Seeking to maintain good relations with Argentina to avoid reprisals against political prisoners, the Israeli government downplayed the significance of Timerman&#x27;s imprisonment. The Foreign Ministry pressed for relocation of the ceremony on 25 May 1980, when Timerman was to receive the Golden Pen of Freedom Award, from the Knesset to a room in Hebrew University. Yitzhak Shamir, the minister of foreign affairs, passed over the ceremony in favor of a holiday reception at the Argentine embassy. Prime Minister Menachem Begin did not attend either, although organizers had at first expected him.

===Press===
Two weeks after Timerman&#x27;s release, Nissim Elnecavé editorialized in &quot;La Luz&quot; (a conservative Jewish Argentine newspaper) that the journalist had been a subversive. He said the publisher had been released because of (not in spite of) his Judaism. This editorial was reprinted in &quot;La Prensa&quot;, another conservative pro-regime newspaper, on 14 October. Two days later the Argentine ambassador Jorge Aja Espil had it delivered to each member of the U.S. Congress.

===&quot;Prisoner Without a Name&quot;===
In Tel Aviv, Timerman wrote and published &quot;Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number&quot; (1981), a memoir about his experience in Argentina, which also covered the larger political issues. The book gained instant international popularity. Timerman was invited to lecture about his experience in Israel, Europe, Canada, and the United States, which increased his international recognition and publicized the human rights situation in Argentina.

The book weaves together different narratives, discussing Timerman&#x27;s imprisonment, his biography, and larger topics of Argentine politics. &quot;Prisoner Without a Name&quot;&#x27; provided new details to the world about the Argentine military dictatorship. For instance, it described a weekly lecture called &quot;The Academy&quot; held for police and military officers, who were taught that they were fighting a &quot;World War III&quot; against left-wing terrorists. The book describes anti-semitism and anti-intellectualism within the military regime. In 1983, it was made into a television film, &quot;Jacobo Timerman: Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number&quot;.

====Responses====
The book was published first in English, by Knopf in the United States with Ashbel Green as senior editor. &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot; was slated to publish a Hebrew version in Israel but pulled out of the project. Domino published it instead. Amos Elon noted in an editorial in &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot; that &quot;one of the main shareholders of &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot; has close business ties with Argentina […] Timerman put many people in a bind in this country and at &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot; by criticizing the Begin government&#x27;s internal and external policy. The dignitaries and public figures who welcomed him at the airport have distanced themselves from him. We can guess why&quot;.

The Canadian Patrick Martin compared &quot;Prisoner Without a Name&quot; favorably to works by Arthur Koestler, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and Elie Wiesel, writing: &quot;But this book is important because the writing is lyrical, even in its horrific detail; because the author is skilful in providing historical respites as the reader travels along the edge of revulsion. It is important also because the events happened today, in this hemisphere. It has never seemed so real&quot;.

President Videla complained to a newly appointed Israeli ambassador in 1980 that Timerman was &quot;orchestrating a campaign to defame Argentina around the world&quot;. The Argentine government maintained that Timerman had been arrested mostly because of his involvement with David Graiver. Argentine diplomats continued to pressure Israel on the topic, saying that Timerman &quot;takes the name of the Holocaust in vain by comparing Argentina today with Nazi Germany&quot;. Israel reduced its official discussion of Timerman, retracting from the &quot;Southern Cone&quot; a pamphlet that discussed awards he received in Israel.

In 1982, Colonel Ramón Camps (the Buenos Aires Police Chief who had been directly involved in torturing Timerman) wrote, with assistance from &quot;La Prensa&quot; publisher Máximo Gainza, &quot;Caso Timerman: Punto final&quot;, a response to &quot;Prisoner Without a Name.&quot; He wrote that Timerman &quot;was destroying the bases of society&quot; with &quot;La Opinión&quot;, particularly its &quot;cultural supplements and section on international politics&quot;. He called Timerman a &quot;champion&quot; of Marxism, &quot;the heresy of modern times&quot;.

=== Lefever nomination and Kirkpatrick Doctrine ===
In 1981, Timerman publicly opposed U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s nomination of Ernest Lefever as Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. When Timerman attended a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee pertaining to Lefever, his presence brought additional attention to the issue of human rights in Argentina. Timerman had praised Patt Derian, who had held the Human Rights position during his imprisonment. During the hearing, Senator Claiborne Pell asked if Lefever would speak against &quot;disappearances&quot; as Derian had done; Lefever responded, &quot;I believe my job is to help sensitize the entire foreign policy establishment to the concern for human rights rather than play a Sir Galahad role going around the world on personal missions&quot;.

As a foreigner, Timerman was not allowed to testify at the hearing. He spoke to reporters in the hall outside, commenting that &quot;a quiet diplomacy is a silent diplomacy […] Nations maintained a silent diplomacy with Hitler, and you see what happened&quot;. He continued, discussing human rights and US foreign policy:
Do you expect to change a government with a policy? No, if you want to change the government you have to send in the Marines. What a human rights foreign policy does is save lives. And Jimmy Carter&#x27;s policy did. How many? I don&#x27;t know. Two thousand? Is that enough? But that policy is even more important to you than to us. It builds up a democratic consciousness in the United States. It is more important for the United States that Lefever be defeated than for Argentina.

I am very disappointed in President Reagan. A new administration is entitled to change an approach, to change a strategy, but not to change a policy. The policy of human rights belongs to United States history. This administration is not changing a strategy, but an ideology.Timerman&#x27;s opposition is credited with ensuring the failure of the Lefever nomination.
Conservative US critics, such as William Buckley, Norman Podhoretz, and Irving Kristol, criticized Timerman&#x27;s comments and noted that he had a relationship with the indicted, late banker David Graiver, accused of laundering funds for leftist guerrillas. Kristol used the Graiver connection to explain the inaction of the Jewish community in Argentina, suggesting that it had &quot;implicitly vindicat[ed] the Reagan administration&#x27;s prudent policy on human rights&quot;.

On the other hand, Timerman&#x27;s experiences were used as good reason by some to oppose the Kirkpatrick Doctrine—a key concept under the Reagan Administration for maintaining diplomatic relations with regimes that were classified as &quot;authoritarian&quot;, not &quot;totalitarian&quot;.

The failure of the Lefever nomination disappointed the Argentine government. Aja Espil, the Argentine ambassador in Washington, wrote to his government that &quot;it must be analyzed not as an isolated incident, but in conjunction with a resurgence in the campaign against the Argentinian government, exacerbated by the publicity over Timerman and his book&quot;. Timerman became the object of increasing political controversy in the US. As his high-profile alarmed the Argentine military government, it responded by releasing interrogation transcripts suggesting a connection between Timerman and the discredited Graiver.

===&quot;The Longest War&quot;===
Soon after completing his prison memoir, Timerman and other journalists were taken to Lebanon to see Israel&#x27;s 1982 war up close. In response, he wrote a book titled, &quot;The Longest War: Israel&#x27;s Invasion of Lebanon&quot; (1982). He was deeply disturbed by the 1982 Lebanon War although he had been an ardent Zionist for most of his life.

Timerman was also disappointed by Israel&#x27;s occupation of Palestinian territory. He wrote: &quot;And I&#x27;m angry, too, with us, with the Israelis who by exploiting, oppressing, and victimizing them [the Palestinians] made the Jewish people lose their moral tradition, their proper place in history.&quot; The book describes Timerman&#x27;s decisions: still recovering from having been tortured in prison, he advised his son Daniel to accept a jail sentence rather than do military service in Lebanon. Daniel was sentenced to prison.

Described by some critics as &quot;a polemic&quot; and &quot;unabashedly pro-Palestinian&quot;, the book identifies Israel as the aggressor in the 1982 conflict. Timerman compared Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians to South Africa&#x27;s treatment of Blacks under Apartheid. He also criticized the U.S. policy in the Mideast: &quot;History will not forgive the United States for not having taken a hand in the conflict long before 1973, as would have been proper for the leading power at the time.&quot;

Timerman included an epilogue about the Sabra and Shatila massacre, a mass slaughter of Palestinians in Lebanon refugee camps that occurred in September 1982. He held the Israel Defense Forces and the government&#x27;s foreign policy responsible. Conservative Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg &quot;found [Timerman&#x27;s] criticism of the Israel Army exaggerated.&quot;

Timerman was one of the earliest and most outspoken Israeli critics of the war, and his status as a Zionist human rights advocate made his opinion difficult to discount. But his position was not popular among Israelis, who justified the war to themselves. &quot;Jacobo Timerman is asking for trouble&quot;, wrote Canadian journalist Patrick Martin, then the Middle East correspondent for &quot;The Globe and Mail.&quot; &quot;He has been in Israel for less than three years and has written a book which attempts to purge the Jewish state of its hatred for Palestinians&quot;. In addition, his book received little coverage by the Jewish press and others in the United States.

In 1982 deputy foreign minister Yehuda Ben Meir said on the United States news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;: &quot;We got him out of Argentina. Now he attacks and denigrates Israel. Any rational person can understand that his book is a collection of calumnies and lies arising from his own self-hatred&quot;. Timerman was shunned by some Israelis and American Jews after his criticism. Later many of his obituaries in the Israeli and US press downplayed or omitted this period of his life to avoid acknowledging his criticism of Israel.

==Journeys and return to Argentina==
Sometime after the publication of &quot;The Longest War&quot;, Timerman left Israel with his wife. According to journalist Amos Elon, Timerman felt disappointed by the Israeli state—not &quot;like a Jew coming home&quot;, as he had hoped. Nevertheless, said Timerman, &quot;I am an Israeli citizen, I behave like an Israeli citizen, and I am always going to be an Israeli citizen.&quot;

He moved to Madrid and then to New York.

Timerman praised the election of Raúl Alfonsín, saying: &quot;Alfonsín&#x27;s victory has opened an era of democracy that is a completely new phenomenon in Argentina.&quot; Judge Fernando Zavalia had, in July 1982, ordered the release of all others arrested in connection with the Graiver case. (However, not all had been freed.)

On 7 January 1984, he and Risha returned to Buenos Aires. One son stayed in Israel and another settled in New York. A third returned to Argentina.

Timerman retained his Israeli citizenship, commenting soon after his return to Buenos Aires: &quot;I am an Israeli citizen. If the Argentine government voluntarily decides to give me my Argentine citizenship back, I will accept it only as long as I can keep my Israeli nationality.&quot;

Upon returning to Argentina, Timerman testified to the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (&quot;Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas&quot;, CONADEP) about his experience in prison. With Rabbi Marshall Meyer (co-chair of the commission along with Ernesto Sabato), he re-visited the prisons where he underwent torture.

In 1985 the government prosecuted numerous people for crimes committed during the Dirty War in the Trial of the Juntas, and major figures were convicted and sentenced to prison. In 1986 Congress passed Ley de Punto Final, stopping the prosecutions and &quot;putting a line&quot; under the events.

Timerman became director of &quot;La Razón&quot; (The Reason), but also published articles in other papers. As a journalist, Timerman continued to criticize the government of Israel for what he considered its shortcomings. A 1987 op-ed by Timerman in &quot;El País&quot; described Israel as &quot;intoxicated&quot;, akin to a European colonial power in its exploitation of Palestinian labor.

He noted that Israelis and some Americans who had formerly given him awards were unhappy with his criticism of Israel. During this period, he said in an interview with the journalist Richard Curtiss,
&quot;How am I received now by those American organizations that gave me awards a few years ago? My old friends meet with me and whenever I visit the States I&#x27;m still invited to speak to some Jewish groups about the problems with Israel. Privately many of them agree that Israel isn&#x27;t everything we wanted it to be. What they don&#x27;t realize is that if we want it to change, we have to say so. Until the American Jewish community realizes this, there&#x27;s no role in Israel for people like me.&quot;

===&quot;Chile: Death in the South&quot;===
In 1987, Timerman released &quot;Chile: Death in the South&quot;, a critical examination of life under the dictator Augusto Pinochet. The book highlights the poverty, hunger, and violence inflicted by Pinochet&#x27;s military dictatorship. It also argues that Chilean society had lost cultural depth in the environment of political repression.

Timerman argues that Chilean centrists and right-wing must be prepared to step in and govern in place of the military. He also suggested that the Catholic Church would play an important role in renewal of the country. The book was translated into English by Robert Cox and published in the United States and London.

===&quot;Cuba: A Journey&quot;===
Timerman&#x27;s 1990 book on Cuba criticized both the Communist government and the adverse effects of the US blockade on Cuba. He suggested that little political change could be achieved in the country until Castro&#x27;s rule ended.

===Dissident once more===
Timerman was an early critic of Carlos Saúl Menem of the Justicialist Party, who became a presidential candidate after serving as governor of La Rioja Province. In 1988, during the presidential campaign, Timerman criticized Menem&#x27;s plan to establish a free port at Isla Martin Garcia, saying it would encourage drug trafficking and money laundering. Menem filed a libel suit against the journalist that year. Timerman was acquitted in the trial, as well as in an appeals trial. Timerman opposed Menem during his election campaign in 1988.

Menem was elected with 47.5% of the vote, defeating the Radical Civic Union candidate. In 1991 he pardoned major figures who had been convicted of kidnapping, disappearances and torture committed during the Dirty War and sentenced to prison. Timerman condemned Menem for giving the pardons. He wrote in a 1991 editorial:

In April 1977, General Carlos Guillermo Suárez Mason ordered my kidnapping in Buenos Aires. A few days ago this man, the cruelest leader of the dirty war, was released from prison, pardoned by President Carlos Saúl Menem. Argentina had obtained his extradition from the US, charged with 43 murders and the kidnapping of 24 people who have since disappeared. During those months of 1977, Colonel Ramon Camps, the most brutal torturer of the dirty war, was in charge of the torture I suffered during interrogation. A few days ago he too was set free, pardoned by Mr. Menem. He had been accused of 214 extortionist kidnappings; 120 cases of torture, 32 homicides; two rapes; two abortions resulting from torture; 18 thefts; and the kidnappings of 10 minors who have disappeared. 

Timerman warned that Argentina was slipping back into totalitarianism, and wrote &quot;I hardly live in Argentina anymore&quot; due to fear of meeting a former torturer.
&quot;Almost all the torturers were free before this latest batch of pardons&quot;, wrote Timerman, &quot;but now the leaders who conceived, planned, and carried out the only genocide recorded in Argentinian history are also at large.&quot;

In 1992 Timmerman testified against Menem in a case regarding the citizenship of arms dealer Monzer al-Kassar. The journalist began spending more time outside the country. His health was failing; he had a heart attack and later surgery after a stroke.

In 1996, with journalist Horacio Verbitsky, novelist Tomás Eloy Martínez, and others, Timerman co-founded a press freedom organization in Buenos Aires known as &quot;Periodisitas&quot;.

In March 1996, the Supreme Court ordered a new trial in the libel case first opened in 1988 by Menem and twice won by Timerman. Menem&#x27;s attorneys had alleged procedural errors. Timerman had written to the Court, declining to defend the case again, from Uruguay, where he had retired. Timerman said there was no arrest warrant against him and that he had been persecuted and condemned to &quot;a second exile.&quot; He said he had not written for years, nor appeared on TV or in lectures, and had been ill. He noted that the President of the Supreme Court was an associate of Menem&#x27;s in their law practice in La Rioja. &quot;Periodistas&quot;, the Association for the Defense of Independent Journalism, protested the order for the trial.

===Death===
Severely depressed following his wife&#x27;s death in 1992, Timerman suffered failing health in his last years, but continued to fight for press freedom. He died of a heart attack in Buenos Aires on 11 November 1999.

===Later events===
In 2003 the Argentine Congress repealed the 1986 Ley de Punto Final. The government re-opened prosecution of crimes committed during the Dirty War. In 2006 Miguel Etchecolatz, Director of Investigations, in the provincial police, who had overseen Timerman&#x27;s arrest and torture, was convicted and sentenced to prison. In its sentencing, the 3-judge tribunal described the actions of Etchecolatz against political prisoner as genocide, the first time the term was applied that way in Argentine trials.

On 9 October 2007, the Catholic priest Christian Von Wernich, personal confessor of provincial chief of police Ramón Camps and holding rank of inspector under Etchecolatz, was convicted of involvement in the abduction and torture of Timerman and numerous other political prisoners in the 1970s. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.

<text>Tiffeny Carleen Milbrett (born October 23, 1972) is an American former professional soccer forward who was a longtime member of the United States women&#x27;s national team. In May 2018 the National Soccer Hall of Fame announced Milbrett will be enshrined in the Hall. A native of Oregon, she starred at the University of Portland where she scored a then school record 103 goals during her career. She won an Olympic gold medal in 1996 in Atlanta and a silver medal at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. She also played in three World Cups, winning in 1999. She is in the top five all-time in the United States national soccer team in three offensive categories.

==Early life==
Milbrett was born in Portland, Oregon, on October 23, 1972. She started her soccer career playing for the Hillsboro Soccer Club in Hillsboro, Oregon, in the Portland metropolitan area. Milbrett grew up in Hillsboro, attending W. Verne McKinney Elementary School in the northwest part of the city. She attended Hillsboro High School (Hilhi) in Hillsboro from 1987 to 1990, where she graduated holding Oregon&#x27;s state record for goals in a season with 54; and in a career with 131. One of the fields at Hilhi is named after her. She was a three-time Oregonian 3A Player of the Year and a two-time &quot;Parade&quot; All-American. She also was a talented basketball player and Track and Field participant, and she was offered college scholarships at those two sports.

===University of Portland===
Milbrett attended the University of Portland where she lettered with the Clive Charles-coached Pilots in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1994. She left the school with various awards and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) records. In 1990, she was named Soccer America&#x27;s Freshman Soccer Player of The Year, and in 1991, she led her team with 21 goals and six assists. In 1992, her 30 goals and 12 assists placed her second among the nation&#x27;s scorers, and in 1994, she helped her team reach the soccer Final Four, making the All-Tournament Team.

Milbrett also garnered West Coast Offensive Player of The Year awards in 1992 and 1994, and was a three-time NSCAA All-American as well as a three time finalist for the Hermann Trophy and Missouri Athletic Club Award. Milbrett was her university&#x27;s all-time leader in goals with 103, and assists with 40. She placed second in NCAA career goals with 103, and tied for fourth in career points with 246. She was also named to Soccer America&#x27;s College Team of The Decade for the 1990s.

==Playing career==

===Club===

====Shiroki Serena====
Professionally, Milbrett began her career in Japan, when she traveled to after graduating in 1995 and joined the Shiroki Serena of the L. League. She played on that team until 1997.

====WUSA ====
In 2001, she became a founding member of the New York Power in the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA). She was the league&#x27;s MVP as well as Offensive Player of The Year. She scored the league&#x27;s first hat trick ever, when the Power beat the Boston Breakers 3–1. She was named to the WUSA&#x27;s second team in 2002, when she finished eighth in the league in points.

====Sunnanå SK, Linköpings FC, Vancouver Whitecaps====
In March 2005, Milbrett went to Sweden for two months to fine-tune her game, scoring five goals for Sunnanå SK during her brief stint. She also played for Linköpings FC in the Swedish Damallsvenskan, having transferred there from the Vancouver Whitecaps Women of the United Soccer Leagues W-League.

====FC Gold Pride====
In March 2009, Milbrett was selected to play with FC Gold Pride of the new Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer and began play in April 2009. In her first appearance with FC Gold Pride, she scored the game-winning goal. For the 2009 season she scored 4 goals in 19 games.

==International==

Milbrett was a member of the US-under 20 team from 1990 to 1993, and saw her first action with the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team in 1991, against China. She scored her first goal with that selection in 1992, against Norway, and helped the team win the International Women&#x27;s Tournament in France in 1993. She played a total of 21 games with the senior team during that period, and in 1995, she finally joined the senior team full-time. She was a member of the team that finished third at the World Cup that year in Sweden, and in 1996, she became a starter for the team that won the 1996 Olympic gold medal in Atlanta, scoring the game-winning goal in the gold medal game against China. In 1997, she set a women&#x27;s national team record with five assists in a game against Australia, and in 1998, she was a member of the team that won the gold medal at the Goodwill Games.

In 1999, she was the goal leader on the US team that won the World Cup, and in 2000 she helped the team obtain Olympic Games silver in Sydney. She was named the CONCACAF Offensive Player of The Year that same year, as well as Chevrolet&#x27;s female athlete of the year. She was also nominated along with Hamm and Sun Wen for the first ever FIFA World Player of the Year award, and participated in the 2001 Nike Women&#x27;s Cup. She also won the Chevrolet Female Athlete of the Year Award for the second time in a row in 2001.

She stepped away from the national team in December 2003 due to philosophical differences with manager April Heinrichs. Milbrett preferred a more creative style of play to which she was more accustomed from her time at the University of Portland, while Heinrichs favored a more tactical brand of soccer which valued speed, athleticism and versatility. She argued, &quot;My philosophy about the game, for instance, is that you have players out there who really do different things. You can&#x27;t ask every player to do the same thing. That&#x27;s why we have amazing midfielders, defenders, forwards and keepers. You can&#x27;t ask them to be of the same mold.&quot;

After Heinrichs resigned in February 2005 and was replaced by Greg Ryan, Milbrett returned to the national team, and finally earned her elusive 200th cap on June 30 in a friendly against rivals Canada in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Her 100th goal came in Team USA&#x27;s next match, a friendly against Ukraine in her hometown of Portland at Merlo Field.

==International goals==
==Coaching career==
She coached at Northwest Soccer Camp as well as at day camps, personal training and Elite Team Training Sessions, and women&#x27;s clinics. Milbrett is a member of the People to People Ambassador Programs. She coached the MVLA Tornado girls&#x27; team. She also coaches for the ECNL girls team.

<text>Kathleen Mansfield Murry (née Beauchamp; 14 October 1888 – 9 January 1923) was a New Zealand writer and critic who was an important figure in the modernist movement. Her works are celebrated across the world and have been published in 25 languages.

Born and raised in a house on Tinakori Road in the Wellington suburb of Thorndon, Mansfield was the third child in the Beauchamp family. She began school in Karori with her sisters, before attending Wellington Girls&#x27; College. The Beauchamp girls later switched to the elite Fitzherbert Terrace School, where Mansfield became friends with Maata Mahupuku, who became a muse for early work and with whom she is believed to have had a passionate relationship.

Mansfield wrote short stories and poetry under a variation of her own name, Katherine Mansfield, which explored anxiety, sexuality, Christianity, and existentialism alongside a developing New Zealand identity. When she was 19, she left New Zealand and settled in England, where she became a friend of D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, Lady Ottoline Morrell and others in the orbit of the Bloomsbury Group. Mansfield was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in 1917, and she died in France aged 34.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp was born in 1888 into a socially prominent Wellington family in Thorndon. Her grandfather Arthur Beauchamp briefly represented the electorate in parliament. Her father Harold Beauchamp became the chairman of the Bank of New Zealand and was knighted in 1923. Her mother was Annie Burnell Beauchamp (née Dyer), whose brother married the daughter of Richard Seddon. Her extended family included the author Countess Elizabeth von Arnim, and her great-granduncle was a Victorian artist Charles Robert Leslie.

Mansfield had two elder sisters, a younger sister and a younger brother. In 1893, for health reasons, the Beauchamp family moved from Thorndon to the country suburb of Karori, where Mansfield spent the happiest years of her childhood. She used some of those memories as an inspiration for the short story &quot;Prelude&quot;.

The family returned to Wellington in 1898. Mansfield&#x27;s first printed stories appeared in the &quot;High School Reporter&quot; and the Wellington Girls&#x27; High School magazine in 1898 and 1899. Her first formally published story &quot;His Little Friend&quot; appeared the following year in a society magazine, &quot;New Zealand Graphic and Ladies Journal&quot;.

In 1902, Mansfield became enamoured of Arnold Trowell, a cellist, but her feelings were for the most part not reciprocated. Mansfield was herself an accomplished cellist, having received lessons from Trowell&#x27;s father.

===London and Europe===
She moved to London in 1903, where she attended Queen&#x27;s College with her sisters. Mansfield recommenced playing the cello, an occupation that she believed she would take up professionally, but she began contributing to the college newspaper with such dedication that she eventually became its editor. She was particularly interested in the works of the French Symbolists and Oscar Wilde, and she was appreciated among her peers for her vivacious, charismatic approach to life and work.

Mansfield met fellow student Ida Baker at the college, and they became lifelong friends. They both adopted their mother&#x27;s maiden names for professional purposes, and Baker became known as LM or Lesley Moore, adopting the name of Lesley in honour of Mansfield&#x27;s younger brother Leslie.

Mansfield travelled in Continental Europe between 1903 and 1906, staying mainly in Belgium and Germany. After finishing her schooling in England she returned to New Zealand, and only then began in earnest to write short stories. She had several works published in the &quot;Native Companion&quot; (Australia), her first paid writing work, and by this time she had her heart set on becoming a professional writer. This was also the first occasion on which she used the pseudonym K. Mansfield. She rapidly grew weary of the provincial New Zealand lifestyle and of her family, and two years later, headed back to London. Her father sent her an annual allowance of 100 pounds for the rest of her life. In later years, she expressed both admiration and disdain for New Zealand in her journals, but she never was able to return there because of her tuberculosis.

Mansfield had two romantic relationships with women that are notable for their prominence in her journal entries. She continued to have male lovers and attempted to repress her feelings at certain times. Her first same-sex romantic relationship was with Maata Mahupuku (sometimes known as Martha Grace), a wealthy young Māori woman whom she had first met at Miss Swainson&#x27;s school in Wellington and again in London in 1906. In June 1907, Mansfield wrote:&quot;I want Maata—I want her as I have had her—terribly. This is unclean I know but true.&quot; Often referring to Maata as Carlotta, Mansfield wrote about her in several short stories. Maata married in 1907, but it is claimed that she sent money to Mansfield in London. The second relationship, with Edith Kathleen Bendall, took place from 1906 to 1908. Mansfield professed her adoration for her in her journals.

===Return to London===
After having returned to London in 1908, Mansfield quickly fell into a bohemian way of life. She published one story and one poem during her first 15 months there. Mansfield sought out the Trowell family for companionship, and while Arnold was involved with another woman, Mansfield embarked on a passionate affair with his brother Garnet. By early 1909, she had become pregnant by Garnet, but Trowell&#x27;s parents disapproved of the relationship, and the two broke up. She then hastily entered into a marriage with George Bowden, a teacher of singing 11 years her senior; they were married on 2 March, but she left him the same evening before the marriage could be consummated.

After Mansfield had a brief reunion with Garnet, Mansfield&#x27;s mother Annie Beauchamp arrived in 1909. She blamed the breakdown of the marriage to Bowden on a lesbian relationship between Mansfield and Baker, and she quickly had her daughter dispatched to the spa town of Bad Wörishofen in Bavaria, where Mansfield miscarried. It is not known whether her mother knew of this miscarriage when she left shortly after arriving in Germany, but she cut Mansfield out of her will.

Mansfield&#x27;s time in Bavaria had a significant effect on her literary outlook. In particular, she was introduced to the works of Anton Chekhov. Some biographers accuse her of plagiarizing Chekhov with one of her early short stories. She returned to London in January 1910. She then published more than a dozen articles in Alfred Richard Orage&#x27;s socialist magazine &quot;The New Age&quot; and became a friend and lover of Beatrice Hastings, who lived with Orage. Her experiences in Germany formed the foundation of her first published collection &quot;In a German Pension&quot; (1911), which she later described as &quot;immature&quot;.

===&quot;Rhythm&quot;===

In 1910, Mansfield submitted a lightweight story to &quot;Rhythm&quot;, a new avant-garde magazine. The piece was rejected by the magazine&#x27;s editor John Middleton Murry, who requested something darker. Mansfield responded with a tale of murder and mental illness titled &quot;The Woman at the Store&quot;. Mansfield was inspired at this time by Fauvism.

Mansfield and Murry began a relationship in 1911 that culminated in their marriage in 1918, but she left him in 1911 and again in 1913. The characters Gudrun and Gerald in D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Women in Love&quot; are based on Mansfield and Murry.

Charles Granville (sometimes known as Stephen Swift), the publisher of &quot;Rhythm&quot;, absconded to Europe in October 1912 and left Murry responsible for the debts the magazine had accumulated. Mansfield pledged her father&#x27;s allowance toward the magazine, but it was discontinued, being reorganised as &quot;The Blue Review&quot; in 1913 and folded after three issues. Mansfield and Murry were persuaded by their friend Gilbert Cannan to rent a cottage next to his windmill in Cholesbury, Buckinghamshire in 1913 in an attempt to alleviate Mansfield&#x27;s ill health. The couple moved to Paris in January the following year with the hope that a change of setting would make writing easier for both of them. Mansfield wrote only one story during her time there, &quot;Something Childish But Very Natural&quot;, then Murry was recalled to London to declare bankruptcy.

Mansfield had a brief affair with the French writer Francis Carco in 1914. Her visit to him in Paris in February 1915 is retold in her story &quot;An Indiscreet Journey&quot;.

=== Impact of World War I ===
Mansfield&#x27;s life and work were changed by the death of her younger brother Leslie Beauchamp, known as Chummie to his family. In October 1915, he was killed during a grenade training drill while serving with the British Expeditionary Force in the Ypres Salient, Belgium, aged 21. She began to take refuge in nostalgic reminiscences of their childhood in New Zealand. In a poem describing a dream she had shortly after his death, she wrote:

At the beginning of 1917, Mansfield and Murry separated, but he continued to visit her at her apartment. Ida Baker, whom Mansfield often called, with a mixture of affection and disdain, her &quot;wife&quot;, moved in with her shortly afterwards. Mansfield entered into her most prolific period of writing after 1916, which began with several stories, including &quot;Mr Reginald Peacock&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;A Dill Pickle&quot;, being published in &quot;The New Age&quot;. Virginia Woolf and her husband Leonard, who had recently set up the Hogarth Press, approached her for a story, and Mansfield presented to them &quot;Prelude&quot;, which she had begun writing in 1915 as &quot;The Aloe&quot;. The story depicts a New Zealand family, configured like her own, moving house.

=== Diagnosis of tuberculosis ===
In December 1917, at the age of 29, Mansfield was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. For part of spring and summer 1918, she joined her friend Anne Estelle Rice, an American painter, at Looe in Cornwall with the hope of recovering. While there, Rice painted a portrait of her dressed in red, a vibrant colour that Mansfield liked and suggested herself. The &quot;Portrait of Katherine Mansfield&quot; is now held by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

Rejecting the idea of staying in a sanatorium on the grounds that it would cut her off from writing, she moved abroad to avoid the English winter. She stayed at a half-deserted, cold hotel in Bandol, France, where she became depressed but continued to produce stories, including &quot;Je ne parle pas français&quot;. &quot;Bliss&quot;, the story that lent its name to her second collection of stories in 1920, was also published in 1918. Her health continued to deteriorate and she had her first lung haemorrhage in March.

By April, Mansfield&#x27;s divorce from Bowden had been finalised, and she and Murry married, only to part again two weeks later. They came together again, however, and in March 1919 Murry became editor of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;, a magazine for which Mansfield wrote more than 100 book reviews (collected posthumously as &quot;Novels and Novelists&quot;). During the winter of 1918–1919, she and Baker stayed in a villa in Sanremo, Italy. Their relationship came under strain during this period; after she wrote to Murry to express her feelings of depression, he stayed over Christmas. Although her relationship with Murry became increasingly distant after 1918 and the two often lived apart, this intervention of his spurred her, and she wrote &quot;The Man Without a Temperament&quot;, the story of an ill wife and her long-suffering husband. Mansfield followed &quot;Bliss&quot; (1920), her first collection of short stories, with the collection &quot;The Garden Party and Other Stories&quot;, published in 1922.

In May 1921, Mansfield, accompanied by her friend Ida Baker, travelled to Switzerland to investigate the tuberculosis treatment of the Swiss bacteriologist Henri Spahlinge. From June 1921, Murry joined her, and they rented the Chalet des Sapins in the Montana region (now Crans-Montana) until January 1922. Baker rented separate accommodation in Montana village and worked at a clinic there. The Chalet des Sapins was only a &quot;1/2 an hours scramble away&quot; from the Chalet Soleil at Randogne, the home of Mansfield&#x27;s first cousin once removed, the Australian-born writer Elizabeth von Arnim, who visited Mansfield and Murry often during this period. Von Arnim was the first cousin of Mansfield&#x27;s father. They got on well, although Mansfield considered her wealthier cousin—who had in 1919 separated from her second husband Frank Russell, the elder brother of Bertrand Russell—to be rather patronising. It was a highly productive period of Mansfield&#x27;s writing, for she felt she did not have much time left. &quot;At the Bay&quot;, &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;The Garden Party&quot; and &quot;A Cup of Tea&quot; were written in Switzerland.

===Last year and death===
Mansfield spent her last years seeking increasingly unorthodox cures for her tuberculosis. In February 1922, she went to Paris to have a controversial X-ray treatment from the Russian physician Ivan Manoukhin. The treatment was expensive and caused unpleasant side effects without improving her condition.

From 4 June to 16 August 1922, Mansfield and Murry returned to Switzerland, living in a hotel in Randogne. Mansfield finished &quot;The Canary&quot;, the last short story she completed, on 7 July 1922. She wrote her will at the hotel on 14 August 1922. They went to London for six weeks before Mansfield, along with Ida Baker, moved to Fontainebleau, France, on 16 October 1922.

At Fontainebleau, Mansfield lived at G. I. Gurdjieff&#x27;s Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man, where she was put under the care of Olgivanna Lazovitch Hinzenburg (who later married Frank Lloyd Wright). As a guest rather than a pupil of Gurdjieff, Mansfield was not required to take part in the rigorous routine of the institute, but she spent much of her time there with her mentor Alfred Richard Orage, and her last letters inform Murry of her attempts to apply some of Gurdjieff&#x27;s teachings to her own life.

Mansfield suffered a fatal pulmonary haemorrhage on 9 January 1923, after running up a flight of stairs. She died within the hour, and was buried at Cimetière d&#x27;Avon, Avon, near Fontainebleau. Because Murry forgot to pay for her funeral expenses, she initially was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave; when matters were rectified, her casket was moved to its current resting place.

Mansfield was a prolific writer in the final years of her life. Much of her work remained unpublished at her death, and Murry took on the task of editing and publishing it in two additional volumes of short stories (&quot;The Doves&#x27; Nest&quot; in 1923, and &quot;Something Childish&quot; in 1924); a volume of poems; &quot;The Aloe&quot;; &quot;Novels and Novelists&quot;; and collections of her letters and journals.

==Legacy==
The following high schools in New Zealand have a house named after Mansfield: Whangārei Girls&#x27; High School; Rangitoto College, Westlake Girls&#x27; High School, and Macleans College in Auckland; Tauranga Girls&#x27; College; Wellington Girls&#x27; College; Rangiora High School in North Canterbury, New Zealand; Avonside Girls&#x27; High School in Christchurch; and Southland Girls&#x27; High School in Invercargill. She has also been honoured at Karori Normal School in Wellington, which has a stone monument dedicated to her with a plaque commemorating her work and her time at the school, and at Samuel Marsden Collegiate School (previously Fitzherbert Terrace School) with a painting, and an award in her name.

Her birthplace in Thorndon has been preserved as the Katherine Mansfield House and Garden, and the Katherine Mansfield Memorial Park in Fitzherbert Terrace is dedicated to her.

A street in Menton, France, where she lived and wrote, is named after her. An award, the &quot;Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship&quot; is offered annually to enable a New Zealand writer to work at her former home, the Villa Isola Bella. New Zealand&#x27;s pre-eminent short story competition is named in her honour.

Mansfield was the subject of a 1973 BBC miniseries &quot;A Picture of Katherine Mansfield&quot;, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The six-part series included depictions of Mansfield&#x27;s life and adaptations of her short stories. In 2011, a television biopic titled &quot;Bliss&quot; was made of her early beginnings as a writer in New Zealand; in this, she was played by Kate Elliott.

Archives of Katherine Mansfield material are held in the Alexander Turnbull Library in the National Library of New Zealand in Wellington, with other important holdings at the Newberry Library in Chicago, the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin and the British Library in London. There are smaller holdings at New York Public Library and other public and private collections. Mansfield&#x27;s literary and personal papers and belongings at the Alexander Turnbull Library were added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register in 2015.

===In fiction===
J. M. Murry wrote in &quot;Reminiscences of D.H. Lawrence&quot; (1933): &quot;I have been told, by one who should know, that the character of Gudrun in &quot;Women in Love&quot; was intended for a portrait of Katherine [Mansfield]. If this is true, it confirms me in my belief that Lawrence had curiously little understanding of her... And yet he was very fond of her, as she was of him.&quot; Murry said that the fictional incident in the chapter &quot;Gudrun in the Pompadour&quot; – when Gudrun tears a letter from Julian Halliday&#x27;s hands and storms out – was based on a true event at the Cafe Royal.

The character Sybil in the 1932 novel &quot;But for the Grace of God&quot;, by Mansfield&#x27;s friend J. W. N. Sullivan, has several resemblances to Mansfield. Musically trained, she goes to the south of France without her husband but with a female friend, and lapses into an incurable illness that kills her.

The character Kathleen in Evelyn Schlag&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;Die Kränkung&quot; (published in English as &quot;Quotations of a Body&quot;) is based on Mansfield.

C. K. Stead&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;Mansfield&quot; depicts the writer in the period 1915-18.

Kevin Boon&#x27;s 2011 novella &quot;Kezia&quot; is based on Mansfield&#x27;s childhood in New Zealand.

Andrew Crumey&#x27;s 2023 novel &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Assassins&quot; has a chapter featuring Mansfield and A. R. Orage at George Gurdjieff&#x27;s institute in France.

<doc id="162904" wikidata="Q727054" url="?curid=162904" title="Eastern District, Hong Kong">
<text>The Eastern District () located on northeastern part of Hong Kong Island, being one of the 18 administrative districts of Hong Kong. It had a population of 529,603 in 2021 The district has the second highest population while its residents have the third highest median household income among the 18 districts.

The Eastern District is well-developed, with a complete public transport and transport network, including subway, bus, ferry, minibus and tram services, while the Island Eastern Corridor and the Eastern Harbour Crossing are important arteries for external traffic. There are comprehensive educational, medical, community and recreational facilities in the area, as well as large shopping malls and commercial centres. At the same time, there are also many historical and cultural attractions in the Eastern District, which are good places for citizens and tourists to relax and entertain.

As the Hong Kong Government is determined to develop the Eastern District, many government departments such as the Customs and Excise Department, Fire Services Department, ICAC and the Water Supplies Department, have moved their headquarters and offices from Central and Wan Chai to the Eastern District. In addition, many multinational corporations from Central have moved to Taikoo Place, which has formed to become a new central business district. As such the Eastern District has undertaken some functions of being a political and economic centre in Hong Kong, which had only belonged to Central and Wan Chai.

== Geography ==
It is located in the northeastern part of the Hong Kong Island and includes the areas of Fortress Hill, North Point, Braemar Hill, Quarry Bay, Tai Koo Shing, Sai Wan Ho, Shau Kei Wan, Heng Fa Chuen, Chai Wan and Siu Sai Wan.

The eastern portion of Causeway Bay and Tin Hau were once in Eastern District, but were moved to Wan Chai District on 1 January 2016.

== History ==
Originally a backwater of fishing villages, quarries and dockyards, there are archaeological evidence there were villages and small towns appeared during the Song dynasty (AD 960–1279).

The Eastern District is now mostly residential, with some industrial areas and several large shopping malls. While mostly Home Ownership Scheme and public housing estates are located from Sai Wan Ho to Chai Wan, large private housing estates are also located within the eastern district, such as Taikoo Shing, Kornhill and Heng Fa Chuen. A commercial hub has been developed from the former industrial areas in western part of Quarry Bay. Hotels and commercial buildings are also developed near Fortress Hill along the coast.

In the past the district was linked by a single traffic artery, King&#x27;s Road, which was notoriously congested during peak hours. This was largely resolved by the construction of the Island Eastern Corridor and the Island line within the MTR rapid transit system in the 1980s. It also contains the tram line, now over 100 years old, that runs near the sea shore from Shau Kei Wan west towards other districts.

==Demographics==
According to the ninth survey of Hong Kong millionaires conducted by Citibank (Hong Kong) and The University of Hong Kong from November 2011 to January 2012, Eastern District is the area with the most millionaires in Hong Kong.

Also, according to the 2021 Population Census in Hong Kong, the population information of the Eastern District is as follows:

==Economic Development==
===Commercial===
Commercial buildings and hotels in the Eastern District are concentrated in Fortress Hill, Taikoo Shing and Quarry Bay. The main building is Taikoo Place, the tallest in the Eastern District since April 2008 SkyscraperHong Kong Island East Center Occupied in stages.

===Industrial===
Industrial buildings are concentrated in the east of North Point, Chai Wan Pier and Chai Wan Road near the MTR station.

===Household Income===
North Point, Quarry Bay and Sai Wan Ho are one of the most expensive urban residential areas in traditional locations, with convenient transportation and the fourth highest median income in Hong Kong. There are 15 public housing estates in Shau Kei Wan and Chai Wan, and 23 HOS housing estates, resulting in a large income gap within the Eastern District. However, public housing has also injected grassroots labour into the Eastern District, enabling the middle-class population in the Eastern District to enjoy cheaper services, so the urban planning of the Eastern District has been very successful.

<doc id="162905" wikidata="Q986434" url="?curid=162905" title="Wan Chai District">
<text>Wan Chai District is one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong. Of the four on Hong Kong Island, it is north-central, and had 166,695 residents in 2021, an increase from 152,608 residents in 2011. The district has the second-highest educationally qualified residents with the highest-bracket incomes, the second-lowest population and the third-oldest quotient. It is a relatively affluent district, with one in five persons having liquid assets of more than HKD 1 million.

==Geography==
The area known as &quot;Wan Chai&quot; is loosely that surrounding Tonnochy Road and the Wan Chai station of the MTR, which is between Admiralty on the west and Causeway Bay on the east. &quot;Wan Chai North&quot;, where major buildings such as the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and Central Plaza stand, refers to the zone north of Gloucester Road, reclaimed from the sea after the 1970s.

The broader administrative &quot;Wan Chai District&quot; includes the areas of Wan Chai, Wan Chai North, Causeway Bay, Happy Valley, Jardine&#x27;s Lookout, Stubbs Road, Wong Nai Chung Gap and Tai Hang.

==History==


The ceremony of the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People&#x27;s Republic of China was performed in the then new wing of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai North.

In May 2009, 300 guests and staff members at the Metropark Hotel Wanchai were quarantined, suspected of being infected or in contact with the H1N1 virus during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. A 25-year-old Mexican man who had stayed at the hotel was later found to have the viral infection. He had travelled to Hong Kong from Mexico via Shanghai.

==Politics==
The district council of Wan Chai consists of 10 councillors, with 2 directly elected, 4 indirectly elected and 2 appointed. Chairmanship is assumed by the District Officer start from 2023.

==Diversity==

Today Wan Chai is sometimes described as the &quot;heart of the city&quot;, representing the epitome of the Hong Kong lifestyle – it has a well-established arts centre, the large exhibition and conference complexes, luxury apartments, five-star and non-five-star hotels, shopping malls, metropolitan office towers and a large government building cluster. It has a multitude of home decoration shops, bars and Mahjong centres. Wan Chai District houses a mosque, as well as cemeteries for several different faiths. Five minutes away from the noisy polluted streets is Bowen Drive, popular for jogging and walking by politicians, movie stars, and government officials.

==Entertainment and shopping==
There are numerous bars and strip joints in the red-light district part of Wan Chai catering to tourists. Within this Fenwick Pier the Fleet Arcade hosted the only McDonald&#x27;s that served alcohol and pizza in Hong Kong until 2004 when it was closed; its replacement was an up-market restaurant. Benches of the McDonald&#x27;s were however left behind at the lobby of the arcade.

Fenwick Pier was landlocked since 2016 following reclamation by the government, and was closed and handed back to the government on 11 February 2022, with a new fire station to be built on the land of where the arcade stood. Prior to the handover of Hong Kong, Fenwick pier was regularly visited by vessels, with numbers ranging from 37 to 99 annually. 

Johnston Road and Queen&#x27;s Road East are the two major streets in the area. Export clothing shops line Johnston and Luard Roads predominantly. Queen&#x27;s Road East has many stores selling Chinese style wooden furniture.

Spring Garden Lane and Tai Wo Street are lined with stalls selling for vegetables, fruit and household items.

Tai Yuen Street specialises in toys in stalls and shops.

Lee Tung Street was in the 2010s converted into a Lee Tung Avenue zone of luxurious residential apartments, shopping, restaurants and bars.
==Education==
==Notable places==
Next to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre is the &quot;Golden Bauhinia Square&quot;. There is a huge sculpture of a bauhinia, which is the representative flower of Hong Kong, in the square. This is a popular tourist spot in Hong Kong for mainland visitors and also the location of the flag-raising ceremony which occurs daily and in a special form on Chinese National Day and other occasions.

Notable skyscrapers include:
* Central Plaza, the third tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, located in Wan Chai North
* Hopewell Centre

According to a household survey by the Census and Statistics Department, the median household income is the second highest of Hong Kong.

As of 2021, the district has a population of 166,695 people. It&#x27;s one of the most diversed districts in Hong Kong, with 75% of the population being Chinese. The ethnic minority groups include Filipinos (9.8%) and white (4.4%). 

==Cross-harbour transport==
The first tunnel that crosses Victoria Harbour, the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, links the former Kellett Island, now part of Wan Chai, with Hung Hom in Kowloon.

The MTR East Rail line was extended to Admiralty in 2022, passing through Wan Chai North. A new Exhibition Centre Station was built near the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, and a new cross-harbour tunnel was built to connect this new station to the new East Rail line platform in Hung Hom.

The Star Ferry operates a ferry route from Wan Chai Pier near Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre to Tsim Sha Tsui.

<doc id="162914" wikidata="Q2984079" url="?curid=162914" title="Huon of Bordeaux">
<text>Huon of Bordeaux is the title character of a 13th-century French epic poem with romance elements.

== &quot;Huon of Bordeaux&quot; ==
The poem tells of Huon, a knight who unwittingly kills Charlot, the son of Emperor Charlemagne. He is given a reprieve from death on condition that he fulfil a number of seemingly impossible tasks: he must travel to the court of the Emir of Babylon and return with a handful of the Emir&#x27;s hair and teeth, slay the Emir&#x27;s mightiest knight, and three times kiss the Emir&#x27;s daughter, Esclarmonde. Huon eventually accomplishes all these feats with the assistance of the fairy king Oberon.

== Editions and continuations ==
The &quot;chanson de geste&quot; that survives (in three more or less complete manuscripts and two short fragments) comprises 10,553 decasyllable verses grouped in 91 assonanced laisses. Presumed dates for its composition vary, but 1216 and 1268 are generally given as &quot;terminus post quem&quot; (earliest possible date) and &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; (latest possible date).

The &quot;chanson&quot;&#x27;s success gave rise to six continuations and one prologue which triple its length:
*&quot;Roman d&#x27;Aubéron&quot; – the Turin manuscript of the romance (the only manuscript to contain all of the continuations) contains the only version of this 14th-century prologue in the shape of a separate romance of &quot;Auberon&quot;. &quot;Auberon&quot; also refers to the title of another chanson de geste, &quot;Auberon&quot;, written as the prologue to &quot;Huon de Bordeaux&quot;. No prose version exists.
*&quot;Huon Roi de Féérie&quot;
*&quot;Chanson d&#x27;Esclarmonde&quot;
*&quot;Chanson de Clarisse et Florent&quot;
*&quot;Chanson d&#x27;Yde et d&#x27;Olive&quot;
*&quot;Chanson de Godin&quot; – the Turin manuscript of the romance contains the only version of this 13th–14th century continuation. No prose version exists. The Turin manuscript also contains the romance of &quot;Les Lorrains&quot;, a summary in seventeen lines of another version of the story, according to which Huon&#x27;s exile is due to his having slain a count in the emperor&#x27;s palace.
*&quot;Roman de Croissant&quot;

The poem and most of its continuations were converted to a rhymed version in alexandrines in 1454 (only one manuscript exists). While no manuscript exists from the 15th century prose version, this version served as the base text for 16th century printed editions (eleven exist), the earliest extant being the edition printed by Michel le Noir in 1513. The work was reprinted ten times in the 17th century, eight times in the 18th and four times in the 19th (notably in a beautifully printed and illustrated adaptation in modern French by Gaston Paris in 1898).

The romance came into vogue in England through the translation () of John Bourchier, Lord Berners, as &quot;Huon of Burdeuxe&quot;, through which Shakespeare heard of the French epic. In Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary there is a note of a performance of a play, &quot;Hewen of Burdocize&quot;, on 28 December 1593. The tale was dramatized and produced in Paris by the Confrérie de la Passion in 1557.

The tale also serves as the basis for Christoph Martin Wieland&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Oberon&quot; of 1780, where Huon becomes the lover of the Sultan&#x27;s daughter Rezia/Amanda. Andre Norton retold the tale in quasi-modern English prose as &quot;Huon of the Horn&quot;, published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company in 1951, which is considered her first fantasy novel.

== Historical sources ==
The Charlot of the story has been identified by Auguste Longnon (&quot;Romania&quot; vol. viii) with Charles the Child, one of the sons of Charles the Bald and Ermentrude of Orléans, who died in 866 in consequence of wounds inflicted by a certain Aubouin in precisely similar circumstances to those related in the romance. The godfather of Huon may safely be identified with Seguin, who was count of Bordeaux under Louis the Pious in 839, and died fighting against the Vikings six years later. Huon himself is probably based on Hunald I, duke of Aquitaine in the 8th century, who was defeated by Charlemagne&#x27;s father.

<doc id="162918" wikidata="Q1431475" url="?curid=162918" title="Hewanorra International Airport">
<text>Hewanorra International Airport , located near Vieux Fort Quarter, Saint Lucia, in the Caribbean, is the larger of Saint Lucia&#x27;s two airports and is managed by the Saint Lucia Air and Seaports Authority (SLASPA). It is on the southern cape of the island, about 53.4 km (33.2 mi) from the capital city, Castries.

The airport is a Fire Category 9 facility that handles 700,000 passengers a year and can accommodate Boeing 747, Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Boeing 777 and other long-range intercontinental jet aircraft. Aircraft maintenance is carried out by Caribbean Dispatch Services. The country&#x27;s smaller airport, George F. L. Charles Airport, is located in the capital city of Castries and handles inter-Caribbean passenger flights, which are currently operated with regional turboprop aircraft as well as with smaller prop aircraft.

== History ==

Hewanorra International Airport was originally named Beane Army Airfield and was used as a military airfield by the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; Sixth Air Force during World War II. Beane Field was activated in early 1941 with a mission to defend Saint Lucia as well as the Caribbean region against an enemy attack. It was subsequently renamed Beane Air Force Base and was operated by the U.S. Air Force before being closed in 1949.

The former military airbase was then refurbished and converted into a commercial airport. There is a disused northeast–southwest runway north of the main east–west runway that was part of the military airfield. It is in poor condition, along with a few dispersal pads.

The name of the airport is an Amerindian word meaning &quot;(land of the) iguana&quot;.
===Historical airline service===
BWIA West Indies Airways (BWIA) introduced Boeing 727-100 &quot;Sunjet&quot; service into the airport in 1965 flying a round trip routing of Port of Spain, Trinidad - Barbados - St. Lucia - San Juan, Puerto Rico - Kingston, Jamaica - Montego Bay - Miami once a week. By 1971, BWIA was operating Boeing 707 jet service on a round trip routing of Port of Spain - St. Lucia - Antigua - New York JFK Airport twice a week.

The Official Airline Guide (OAG) lists three airlines operating jet service into the airport during the mid and late 1970s: British Airways, BWIA West Indies Airways (operating as BWIA International at this time), both flying Boeing 707 aircraft, and Eastern Airlines flying Boeing 727-100 aircraft. According to the OAG, all three air carriers were operating jet flights into the airport from other islands in the Caribbean at this time with British Airways also flying nonstop and direct service into the airport from London Heathrow Airport. The Feb. 1, 1976 OAG lists weekly nonstop Boeing 707 flights operated by British Airways from both Barbados and Port of Spain with these flights originating in London and also lists flights operated by Eastern with Boeing 727-100 service nonstop from Fort-de-France, Pointe-à-Pitre and Port of Spain as well as direct, no change of plane 727 flights from San Juan and St. Croix with same day connecting Eastern service being offered four days a week from Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, New York City and Pittsburgh via its Caribbean hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Also in 1976, according to its system timetable, BWIA International was operating nonstop Boeing 707 service into the airport from Port of Spain twice a week as well as weekly nonstop 707 flights from both Antigua and Barbados with connecting 707 flights twice a week from New York City being operated via either Antigua or Barbados.

British Airways and BWIA International were serving the airport with wide body jetliners in 1993 with British Airways operating Boeing 747-200 aircraft and BWIA operating Lockheed L-1011 Tristar series 500 aircraft. According to the OAG, BWIA International was operating nonstop service from Frankfurt, Germany and London Heathrow Airport as well as direct one stop service from Zürich, Switzerland while British Airways was operating direct one stop service from London Gatwick Airport at this time.

In 1994, American Airlines was operating daily direct Boeing 727-200 service from Washington Dulles Airport via a stop at San Juan, Puerto Rico, as well operating nonstop Boeing 757-200 service on the weekends from New York Kennedy Airport. Leisure Air also operated a nonstop flight from New York JFK Airport once a week with an Airbus A320, while BWIA was operating direct McDonnell Douglas MD-80 flights three days a week from Miami via a stop at Antigua. By the next year, American was operating larger Boeing 767-300 wide body jetliners on its weekend nonstop service from New York JFK Airport in addition to daily direct wide body Airbus A300 service from New York JFK via an intermediate stop in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while British Airways was operating nonstop Boeing 747-200 service from both Antigua and Barbados several days a week with these services originating at London Gatwick Airport. Also in 1995, BWIA was operating nonstop McDonnell Douglas MD-80 service from New York JFK Airport four days a week, as well as direct MD-80 flights four days a week from Miami via a stop in Antigua in addition to wide body Lockheed L-1011 series 500 service nonstop from Antigua, Barbados and Port of Spain several days a week with these flights then operating continuing transatlantic service to either London Heathrow Airport, Frankfurt or Zürich while Air Canada was operating weekend nonstop service from Toronto with Airbus A320 and wide body Boeing 767-200 jets.

== Expansion ==

Officials have proposed a new terminal building at Hewanorra to accommodate Saint Lucia&#x27;s growing tourism industry. It is envisaged that the new terminal would be more than twice as large as the current facility, equipped with 6 to 8 jet bridges and a proposed 13 parking positions, including one stand capable of handling the Airbus A380. Currently, the airport has seven parking positions: two for wide-body aircraft, two behind those, and three for medium-sized aircraft such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 757.

Under a master plan, the runway will also be widened. At , Hewanorra&#x27;s runway is already long enough to handle most commercial aircraft. However, its width is insufficient to handle the Airbus A380, which requires from shoulder to shoulder and a length of at least . There are also plans to exploit a disused concrete runway to the north of the airport, which was built by the American military during World War II and could be recommissioned as a taxiway for cargo operations and access to hangars. One proposal is to move cargo operations to the north side of the airport, putting in all the requisite infrastructure as well as two stands for aircraft up to Boeing 747 freighter size. This project is hoped to be financed by the increased airport tax, which is now approximately XCD 290 (USD 107.40) for each passenger.

==Runway and taxiways==
The airport uses a single east–west runway, connected by two taxiways at its midsection, with turning bays at the end for back-tracking. As a result of the trade winds that blow northeast across Saint Lucia, all aircraft usually arrive and depart in an easterly direction. This results in a typical flight path for arriving aircraft along the west coast of Saint Lucia, while departing flights usually fly along the east coast of the island. On relatively rare occasions, weather disturbances such as passing hurricanes or tropical systems may force planes to take off or land in a westerly direction.

The airport is equipped with RNAV, VOR/DME, and NDB approaches.

==Other facilities==
The airport houses the Hewanorra Outstation of the Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority.

==Accidents and incidents==
*Quebecair Flight 714, a charter flight operated with a Boeing 707-123B from Toronto, crashed on its approach to Hewanorra International Airport on 19 February 1979. Wind shear caused the aircraft to halt its descent. The copilot, who was flying at the time, retarded the throttles, but the aircraft had just passed the wind shear zone, and the nose slammed into the runway and bounced twice, destroying the nose landing gear. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and was written off.
*Virgin Atlantic Flight 98 from A.N.R. Robinson International Airport on the island of Tobago landed on a flooded runway at the airport on 24 December 2013. The Airbus A330 sustained damage to panels on the underside of the aircraft near the pack bay. The adjacent Petite Riviere Du Vieux Fort had flooded and Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority investigators concluded the aircraft landed in one to two feet of water.

<doc id="162921" wikidata="Q472953" url="?curid=162921" title="Trepanning">
<text>Trepanning, also known as trepanation, trephination, trephining or making a burr hole (the verb &quot;trepan&quot; derives from Old French from Medieval Latin from Greek , literally &quot;borer, auger&quot;), is a surgical intervention in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the human skull. The intentional perforation of the cranium exposes the &quot;dura mater&quot; to treat health problems related to intracranial diseases or release pressured blood buildup from an injury. It may also refer to any &quot;burr&quot; hole created through other body surfaces, including nail beds. A trephine is an instrument used for cutting out a round piece of skull bone to relieve pressure beneath a surface.

In ancient times, holes were drilled into a person who was behaving in what was considered an abnormal way to let out what people believed were evil spirits. Evidence of trepanation has been found in prehistoric human remains from Neolithic times onward. The bone that was trepanned was kept by the prehistoric people and may have been worn as a charm to keep evil spirits away. Evidence also suggests that trepanation was primitive emergency surgery after head wounds to remove shattered bits of bone from a fractured skull and clean out the blood that often pools under the skull after a blow to the head. Hunting accidents, falls, wild animals, and weapons such as clubs or spears could have caused such injuries. Trepanations appear to have been most common in areas where weapons that could produce skull fractures were used. The primary theories for the practice of trepanation in ancient times include spiritual purposes and treatment for epilepsy, head wound, mental disorders, and headache, although the latter may be just an unfounded myth.

In modern eye surgery, a trephine instrument is used in corneal transplant surgery. The procedure of drilling a hole through a fingernail or toenail is also known as trephination. It is performed by a physician or surgeon to relieve the pain associated with a subungual hematoma (blood under the nail); a small amount of blood is expressed through the hole and the pain associated with the pressure is partially alleviated. Similarly, in abdominal surgery, a trephine incision is when a small disc of abdominal skin is excised to accommodate a stoma. Although the abdominal wall does not contain bone, the use of the word &quot;trephine&quot; in this context may relate to the round excised area of skin being similar in shape to a burr hole.

== History ==

=== Prehistoric evidence ===
Trepanation dates back to 7,000–10,000 years ago, is perhaps the oldest surgical procedure for which there is archaeological evidence, and in some areas may have been quite widespread. The main pieces of archaeological evidence are in the forms of cave paintings and human remains. At one burial site in France dated to 6500 BCE, 40 out of 120 prehistoric skulls found had trepanation holes. At the time only around 40% of people survived the procedure.

More than 1,500 trephined skulls from the Neolithic period (representing 5–10% of all cranial remains from that era) have been uncovered throughout the worldfrom Europe, Siberia, China and the Americas. Most of the trephined crania belong to adult males, but women and children are also represented.

There also exists evidence of trepanation being performed on a cow in France around 3400–3000 BCE. If performed while alive, the cow did not survive the procedure. It is unclear if this was performed as a veterinary procedure, medical experimentation or for other unknown reasons. However, It could be the earliest archaeological example of veterinary surgery or animal medical experimentation.

=== Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica ===

In the more recent times of postclassical pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, evidence for the practice of trepanation and an assortment of other cranial deformation techniques comes from a variety of sources, including physical cranial remains of burials, allusions in iconographic artworks and reports from the post-colonial period.

Among New World societies, trepanning is most commonly found in the Andean civilizations, such as pre-Incan cultures. For example, the Paracas culture Ica, situated in what is now known as Ica, located south of Lima. Trepanation has also been found in the Muisca Confederation (in modern-day Colombia) and the Inca Empire. In both, even cranioplasty existed. The prevalence of trepanation among Mesoamerican civilizations is much lower, at least judging from the comparatively few trepanned crania that have been uncovered.

The archaeological record in Mesoamerica is further complicated by the practice of skull mutilation and modification carried out &quot;after&quot; the death of the subject, to fashion &quot;trophy skulls&quot; and the like of captives and enemies. This was a widespread tradition, illustrated in pre-Columbian art that occasionally depicts rulers adorned with or carrying the modified skulls of their defeated enemies, or of the ritualistic display of sacrificial victims. Several Mesoamerican cultures used a skull-rack (known by its Nahuatl term, &quot;tzompantli&quot;), on which skulls were impaled in rows or columns of wooden stakes. Even so, some evidence of genuine trepanation in Mesoamerica (i.e., where the subject was living) has survived.

The earliest archaeological survey published of trepanned crania was a late 19th-century study of several specimens recovered from the Tarahumara mountains by the Norwegian ethnographer Carl Lumholtz. Later studies documented cases identified from a range of sites in Oaxaca and central Mexico, such as Tilantongo, Oaxaca and the major Zapotec site of Monte Albán. Two specimens from the Tlatilco civilization&#x27;s homelands (which flourished around 1400 BCE) indicate the practice has a lengthy tradition.

Specimens identified from the Maya civilization region of southern Mexico, Guatemala and the Yucatán Peninsula show no evidence of the drilling or cutting techniques found in central and highland Mexico. Instead, the pre-Columbian Maya apparently used an abrasive technique that ground away at the back of the skull, thinning the bone and sometimes perforating it, similar to the examples from Cholula. Many skulls from the Maya region date from the Postclassic period (), and include specimens found at Palenque in Chiapas, and recovered from the Sacred Cenote at the prominent Postclassic site of Chichen Itza in northern Yucatán.

=== Ancient China ===
Before 2007, archaeological evidence of trepanation in ancient China was nonexistent. Since Chinese culture mainly focuses only on traditional Chinese medicine that usually entails non-surgical treatments such as acupuncture, balancing Qigong, cupping, herbal remedies, etc. The resulting misconception was that trepanation was not practiced in ancient China. However, in 2007, Han and Chen from the Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences looked at six trepanned skulls spanning between the Neolithic period through the Bronze and Iron Ages ( years ago) found in five different locations. Along with the discovery of these trepanned skulls, another collection of 13 trepanned skulls was discovered and dated to 3,000 years ago. In 2015, an intact 3,600-year-old mummy with a trepanned skull was discovered. Meanwhile, the oldest trepanned skull (M382) analysed by Han and Chen was radiocarbon dated to around 5,000 years ago and discovered at the Fuija site in Guangrao, Shandong. The skull, which belonged to an adult male, exhibited a right parietal calvarial defect (31 x 25 mm) with evidence of scraping by a trephine-like tool. Additionally, bone regeneration and smooth edges suggest that the subject recovered from the surgery and lived a relatively long time afterward.

The 3,600-year-old perforated skull of a mummified female dating to 1615 BCE was found in the Xiaohe tomb in China&#x27;s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The only known female with a trepanned skull, it showed signs of bone spurs growth and retraction of the edges, suggesting that she also survived the surgery. Found in a massive burial site, this mummy was one of the hundreds found in the &quot;Little River&quot; Tomb complex.

The Bronze Age was found to be the period with the largest number of trepanned skulls in ancient China.

=== Medieval East Africa ===
Trephining has a long history in East Africa. Bones of depressed fractures were elevated by surgeons of Bunyoro-Kitara. The hair may or may not have been shaved depending upon the site of the operation.

Trepanning at the Kisii people in Kenya was filmed in 1958.

=== Pre-modern Europe ===
Trepanation was known to prehistoric Europeans, with some populations having impressive success rates of 78% in the Iron Age. 

Trepanation was also practised in the classical and Renaissance periods. Hippocrates gave specific directions on the procedure from its evolution through the Greek age, and Galen also elaborates on the procedure. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, trepanation was practiced as a cure for various ailments, including seizures and skull fractures. Out of eight skulls with trepanations from the 6th to 8th centuries found in southwestern Germany, seven skulls show clear evidence of healing and survival after trepanation, suggesting that the survival rate of the operations was high and the infection rate was low.

In the graveyards of pre-Christian (Pagan) Magyars, archeologists found a surprisingly high frequency (12.5%) of skulls with trepanation, although more than 90% only partial (these served probably ritual purposes). The trepanation was performed on adults only, with similar frequencies for males and females, but increasing frequency with age and wealth. This custom suddenly disappeared with the Magyars&#x27; conversion to Christianity.

A small area near (modern) Rostov-on-Don, in southern Russia, may have been a centre for ritual trepanning, around 6000 years ago, according to archeologists who discovered remains of eight recipients of the practice, within a small area, all with the incision in the unusual obelion position, high on the back of the head.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, around 80% of people survived the procedure of trepanation.

=== Modern medical practices ===
The prefrontal leucotomy, a precursor to lobotomy, was performed by cutting a trephine hole into the skull, inserting an instrument, and destroying parts of the brain. This was later made unnecessary by the development of the orbital transit lobotomy where a spike was inserted through the eye-sockets.

Trepanation is a treatment used for epidural and subdural hematomas, and surgical access for certain other neurosurgical procedures, such as intracranial pressure monitoring. Modern surgeons generally use the term &quot;craniotomy&quot; for this procedure. Unlike in folk practices, a craniotomy must be performed only after diagnostic imaging (like computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) has pinpointed the issue within the skull; preoperative imaging allows for accurate examination and evaluation. Unlike in trepanation, the removed piece of skull (called a bone flap) is typically replaced as soon as possible, where it can heal. Trepanation instruments, nowadays being replaced with cranial drills, are now available with diamond-coated rims, which are less traumatic than the classical trephines with sharp teeth. They are smooth to soft tissues and cut only bone. Additionally, the specially designed drills come with a safety feature that prevents the drill from penetrating into the brain tissue (through the dura mater). Along with antisepsis and prophylaxis of infection, modern neurosurgery is a common procedure for many reasons other than head trauma.

In documented cases of trepanning done in Africa and Oceania during the 20th century, patient survival rate was seen to be approximately 90%.

=== Myth of trepanation as a treatment for headaches ===
After the retrieval of some skulls from the Neolithic era that showed signs of trepanation, in the nineteenth century, the false belief that these holes were drilled for the treatment of headaches or other neurological disorders started spreading. During the 1870s, the French anthropologist and physician Paul Broca found several European and South American children&#x27;s skulls dating to the Neolithic age that were perforated surgically. Since no signs of fractures that could justify this complex procedure to relieve trauma were found, a debate emerged around why these children were subjected to trepanation while they were still alive. Broca theorized that this operation had a ritual or religious purpose, probably to remove &quot;confined demons&quot; inside the head of the patient, or to create healing or fortune talismans with the removed skull fragments. However, he also suggested that the operation may have been performed to treat some infantile conditions such as febrile seizures to explain why it was performed only on children.

Broca never mentioned headaches, though, and the association was established only several decades later by the world-famous Canadian physician William Osler in 1913. Osler misinterpreted Broca&#x27;s words, and added other conditions such as &quot;infantile convulsions, headache and various cerebral diseases believed to be caused by confined demons.&quot; Osler&#x27;s theory was seen as particularly palatable by other armchair anthropologists, who were fascinated by the idea that folk traditions and/or myths could be linked with the treatment for common conditions such as migraine. Eventually, Broca&#x27;s speculation came to be accepted as fact, and the myth was perpetuated by other historians and physicians. To this day, there&#x27;s no credible evidence supporting this theory, especially since children are much less frequently affected by migraine and headache disorders than adults. Nevertheless, the myth persists.

=== Cultural Perspectives on Trepanation ===
The motivations behind trepanation varied significantly across cultures, often tied to beliefs about health, spirituality, and the treatment of ailments. Early instances of the practice may have been influenced by a combination of supernatural beliefs and early understandings of physical ailments, leading to its acceptance in various medical traditions. In many cultures, it was believed that drilling a hole in the skull will let out the evil spirits that caused pain and illness. It can be explained as most head injuries and diseases, such as migraine, felt like pounding, so cutting a hole in head may help to relieve the pain and pressure. In Africa and Europe, not only this procedure was performed for spiritual reasons, but also the discs made of cranial bones were commonly used as shield from demons and evils. In China, twelve shaman corpses in a tomb were found with trephined bodies because they also had duties of doctors. This tells about connection of cranial surgery to religion; there was conception that open hole in head contributes to communication with god and souls of dead people. Trepanation was also associated in Chinese medicine with the balance of vital energy, or qi. They understand trepanation as a way to balance the body and energy, spiritual and physical health. On the other hand, it was thought that cerebral disorder arise from the loss of spiritual image in ancient Peru, illness developed after being separated from body. Trepanation would have been done in order to allow the spirit to reenter the body. In these cases, the patient may have suffered from paralysis, cerebral palsy, severe depression, or mental retardation.

== Tools and methods ==
In ancient times, trepanation instruments were less complex, and were commonly made out of flint, obsidian, or harder material such as stone knives, and later with metal such as bronze and copper. Additionally, the procedure was done by practitioners utilizing &quot;tumi&quot; (ceremonial knife in early Peru), sharpened seashells (South Pacific), a trephine drill, bronze knife, etc. The Greeks and Romans were the first to design medical instruments that were used to penetrate the skull. Such instruments includes the &quot;terebra serrata&quot;, made to perforate the cranium by positioning the instrument&#x27;s pointed end against the cranium and manually rolling the instrument&#x27;s shaft back and forth between the surgeon&#x27;s two hands. By the Renaissance period, when trepanation was routinely performed, a range of instruments were developed to accommodate the demand.

As many as five main methods were found for trephination: 
# Rectangular intersecting cuts
# Scraping utilizing an abrasive instrument such as flint
# Circular grooving
# Boring and cutting by a circular trephine or crown saw
# Burr hole done by drilling several circle holes closely to create a space and then cut/chisel the bone between the hole.
The scraping method was found to be the most common in prehistoric times. The differences in method vary in the amount and depth of bone being removed. The trepanation surgical procedure includes exposure of the dura mater without damaging the underlying blood vessels, meninges, and brain. Over time, the skin will reform over the puncture site, but the hole in the skull will remain.

The location of the trepanation on the skull varies by geographical region and period, common locations are the frontal and the occipital bones. In most cases, trepanation was a one-off operation, with only a small percentage of the trepanned skulls having undergone more than one surgery. In those with multiple openings, the extent of bone remodelling helps identify whether the opening was done at around the same time or at different times during the individual&#x27;s life.

== Risks ==
A neurosurgeon can perform the procedure safely, although it comes with severe repercussions such as direct or indirect perioperative complications, which include increased damage to the brain, infection, blood loss, hemorrhage, and potentially death due to the trauma as the skull&#x27;s protective covering is compromised. The operation leaves very minimal space for error and a high incidence of mortality if the dura mater is penetrated. Additionally, there is a high risk of infection if the operation is conducted with contaminated tools or improper sanitary wound care. If the infection is not caught and treated immediately, it can be fatal or lead to significant and permanent brain damage. After surgery, neither the surrounding bone nor the trepanned bone piece ever show any osseous healing like other bones. Osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity occurs after the first week; hyperemia and osteoclastic activity are seen on the necrotic bone surrounding the trepanation site, due to loss of blood supply.

== Voluntary trepanation ==
Since the early 1960s, voluntary trepanation has been performed by people interested in &quot;enhancing mental power and well-being&quot;. The practice of trepanning also continues today due to belief in various pseudoscientific medical benefits. For example, some have tried trepanation as a means of emulating the &quot;third eye&quot;, in order to achieve clairvoyance or as a means of maintaining a &quot;permanent state of euphoria&quot;. Other proponents claim that trepanning results in increased blood flow. Individuals have practiced non-emergency trepanning for psychological purposes. A prominent proponent of the modern view is Peter Halvorson, who drilled a hole in the front of his own skull to increase &quot;brain blood volume&quot;.

One of the most prominent advocates of trepanning was Dutch librarian Bart Huges. In 1965, Huges drilled a hole in his own head with a dentist drill as a publicity stunt. Huges claimed that trepanning increases &quot;brain blood volume&quot; and thereby enhances cerebral metabolism in a manner similar to cerebral vasodilators such as ginkgo biloba. These claims are unsubstantiated by research. Huges and his girlfriend also made several comic books in the 1970s, which promoted trepanation.

In a chapter of his book &quot;Eccentric Lives &amp; Peculiar Notions&quot;, esotericist John Michell cites Huges as pioneering the idea of trepanning in his 1962 monograph, &quot;Homo Sapiens Correctus&quot;, which is often cited by advocates of self-trepanation. Among other arguments, Huges contends that children have a higher state of consciousness and since children&#x27;s skulls are not fully closed, one can return to an earlier, childlike state of consciousness by self-trepanation. Further, by allowing the brain to freely pulsate Huges argues that a number of benefits will accrue.

Michell quotes Joey Mellen&#x27;s book, &quot;Bore Hole&quot;. At the time the passage below was written, Joey and his partner, Amanda Feilding, had made two previous attempts at trepanning Mellen. The second attempt ended up placing Mellen in the hospital, where he was reprimanded severely and sent for psychiatric evaluation. After he returned home, Mellen decided to try again. He describes his third attempt at self-trepanation:

After some time there was an ominous sounding schlurp and the sound of bubbling. I drew the trepan out and the gurgling continued. It sounded like air bubbles running under the skull as they were pressed out. I looked at the trepan and there was a bit of bone in it. At last!

Feilding also performed a self-trepanation with a drill, while Mellen shot the operation for the short film &quot;Heartbeat in the Brain&quot;, which was long thought to have been lost. Portions of the film can be seen in the documentary &quot;A Hole in the Head&quot;.

Michell also describes a British group that advocates self-trepanation to allow the brain access to more space and oxygen. Other modern practitioners of trepanation claim that it holds other medical benefits, such as relief from depression and from other psychological ailments. In 2000, two men from Cedar City, Utah, were prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license after they performed a trepanation on an English woman to treat her chronic fatigue syndrome and depression.

In 2023, Michael Raduga, a Russian lucid dreaming researcher, performed self-neurosurgery that included trepanation, electrode implantation, and electrical stimulation of the motor cortex. The goal was to stimulate the brain during REM sleep, sleep paralysis, and lucid dreams.

== Modern interpretation and research ==
Modern forensic and medical research on trepanned skulls demonstrates advanced surgical skills in prehistoric societies and highlights how trepanation influenced later developments in neurosurgery and the history of medicine. With the advancement of technology, it became possible to examine and interpret the trepanned skull with CT scans and new techniques of bioarchaeology. A recent study provided new perspective of the healing process of skull after cranial trepanation: even though there are many examples of prehistoric cranial lesions that have been classified as &quot;healed trepanations&quot;, the research shows that definition of “healing” is not consistent. One of the reasons of distinction in variations of healing process is difference of surgical methods such as “scraping” or “grooving” that might alter the angle of the edge. The first smoothening of bone begins in 5 months, but total healing or closure never happens.

By the 20th century, the ancient practice of trepanning evolved into procedure of bone marrow biopsy, which became vital for identifying illnesses including anemia, leukomia, lymphoma, and tuberculosis. This change happened as doctors realized the need of accessing the inside of bones for diagnostic purposes, especially in the treatment of blood-related ailments. The initial tools of trepanation as crown trephine transitioned into the biopsy needles in modern medicine such as Vim-Silverman needle and Jamshidi needle. The instrument created a small hole in the skull, reducing the possibility of significant injury. These instruments’ adaptation in performing multiple medical functions, ranging from diagnosing blood and relieving cranial pressure, shows how tools adapt to advancements in medicine.

<doc id="162922" wikidata="Q3874179" url="?curid=162922" title="Nectar (loyalty card)">
<text>Nectar is a loyalty card scheme in the United Kingdom run by Nectar 360 Limited, company wholly owned by Sainsbury&#x27;s. The scheme is the largest in the United Kingdom, and comprises a number of partner companies including Sainsbury&#x27;s, Esso, Argos and British Airways. It launched in 2002 with initially four partner companies, and by 2010 had grown to include over 14 companies and over 400 online retailers. Participating companies cover sectors including travel, retail, finance and newspapers.

The scheme was established by Loyalty Management Group, replacing the existing schemes of three of the four launch companies. Nectar was purchased by the Canadian Groupe Aeroplan (now Aimia) in 2007, and purchased by Sainsbury&#x27;s in 2018.

==History==
The Nectar scheme was launched in 2002, merging the existing loyalty programmes of Sainsbury&#x27;s, BP and Barclaycard; and including Debenhams, which did not have an existing scheme. It was run by Loyalty Management Group, then chaired by Sir Keith Mills, the founder of Air Miles. Robert Gierkink, who previously played a key role in the founding and launches of Air Miles Canada and Air Miles Netherlands, was founding CEO. The co-founding senior executive team and management shareholders of Nectar – Loyalty Management UK Ltd. further consisted of five Vice Presidents: Todd Almeida (previously Air Miles Netherlands), Martin Briggs, Peter Buis, Steve Lobb (previously Fly Buys New Zealand ) and Alex Moorhead (previously Air Miles Canada). Additional co-founding management included Koos Berkhout and Jan Pieter Lips, both of whom previously worked for Air Miles Netherlands.

At the time of launch, Nectar confirmed it would be open to more companies to join, excluding rivals of existing members. In December 2007, Loyalty Management Group was purchased by the Canadian Aeroplan, for £368 million. Aeroplan later re-branded itself to Aimia.

By 2010, Nectar claimed that 16.8 million people were part of the scheme, and that it had 14 member companies and over 400 online retailers.

In August 2017, Nectar announced it was partnering with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper. This association upset many customers, who cancelled their accounts and posted photos of their cut-up loyalty cards online. The company responded, &quot;we know that not all of you will support every partner.&quot;

On 1 February 2018 J Sainsbury plc announced that it had purchased the Nectar business from Aimia for £60 million.

Sainsbury&#x27;s began a localised trial with a new Nectar points-earning scheme for stores on the Isle of Wight in April 2018, in which the standard earning rate of one point for each pound spent was replaced by points on specific items plus points based on how frequently and how long a member has been shopping with Sainsbury&#x27;s.

The trial completed in October 2019, and a redesigned logo and app was launched, with the provision of a digital card on the app to scan.

==Collection==
Cardholders receive points on purchases made at participating retailers both instore and online, generally beginning at one point per whole pound spent. Points for fuel at Esso and Sainsbury&#x27;s are awarded for each litre purchased. Extra points may be earned when buying certain products or during particular promotions. A number of other online retailers award points when purchases are made on their websites accessed through the main Nectar website.

Nectar receives a payment from each retailer for each point paid to a customer. It then reimburses the retailer when the points are redeemed.

==Redemption==
A number of retailers allow cardholders to redeem points in store for money off their shopping, including Argos and Sainsbury&#x27;s. Points are typically be redeemed in batches of 500, with each point being worth 0.5p.

Points can also be redeemed with a number of partners through avouchers, including Eurostar, eBay, and Caffè Nero. Points are lost if a Nectar account is closed. For example, an account may be closed if no points have been earned or redeemed for a continuous period of 12 months. As Nectar points do not normally &quot;expire&quot;, it is possible for cardholders to save towards more expensive rewards, such as train tickets and holidays.

<text>The Wa people (Wa: Vāx; , ; ; ) are a Southeast Asian ethnic group that lives mainly in Northern Myanmar, in the northern part of Shan State and the eastern part of Kachin State, near and along Myanmar&#x27;s border with China, as well as in China&#x27;s Yunnan Province.

Historically, the Wa have inhabited the Wa States, a territory that they have claimed as their ancestral land since time immemorial. It is a rugged, mountainous area located between the Mekong and the Salween River, with the Nam Hka flowing across it. The Wa traditionally practiced subsistence agriculture by cultivating rice, peas, beans, poppies and walnuts. They bred water buffaloes, which they used mainly for sacrificial purposes. Generally, the traditional customs of the Wa, as well as their lifestyle, are very similar to those of the Naga people further to the Northwest. The Wa people speak the Wa language which is part of the Mon-Khmer group of languages.

Many of the Wa are animists and a small proportion of the population follows a derivative of either Buddhism or Christianity.

==Cultural history==

British journalist and colonial administrator Sir George Scott described how in the Wa origin myths the first Wa originated from two female ancestors &quot;Ya Htawm&quot; and &quot;Ya Htai&quot; who spent their early phase as tadpoles &quot;(rairoh)&quot; in a small lake known as &quot;Nawng Hkaeo&quot;. The lake is located in the northeastern Wa territory in the border area between China and Myanmar.

Very little is known about the early history of the Wa. What is known is mostly made up of local legends telling that in the distant past the historical Wa States and all the territories of eastern Shan State, as well as large swathes of the adjacent areas of present-day China had belonged to the Wa. In the area of the former Kengtung State the Wa were displaced around 1229 and were later defeated by King Mangrai. At the time of British rule in Burma the Shan were the majority in Kengtung state, with other groups such as Akha and Lahu forming sizable communities. The Wa now form a minority of only about 10% in Kengtung District despite having been the original inhabitants.

The Wa originally had animist religious beliefs centered around ritual blood sacrifices. Villages had a spirit healer &quot;(Tax Cao Chai)&quot; and the traditional way of dealing with sickness or other problems was to sacrifice a chicken, a pig or a larger animal, depending from the magnitude of the affliction. According to local legend, the practice of cutting a human head was intended as a ritual sacrifice in order to improve the fertility of the rice fields. Traditional villages had also shrines &quot;(Nyiex Moeg)&quot; where a buffalo was sacrificed once every year at a special Y-shaped post named &quot;Khaox Si Gang&quot; with an offering of the blood, meat and skin performed at it. Additionally, among the traditional spirit-worshiping Wa—a practice that still exists among the Christian Wa—animals were sacrificed at festivities like weddings and funerary rituals. However, the Wa that were under Buddhist influence developed different traditions.

In the traditional Wa society monogamous marriage was the norm and there was sexual freedom for both men and women before marriage. The chewing of betel with areca nut was formerly also an important custom. The Wa have different kinds of traditional dances. One important dance in their culture is accompanied by the beating of a large hollow wooden drum. This way of dancing, among other Wa dances such as the hair dance and festivals, is being promoted as a tourist attraction by the Yunnan tourism authorities in China. The Wa Women&#x27;s Association also promotes dance, as well as other cultural and philanthropic activities.

The Wa people also have a well-engrained drinking culture, with large amounts of local moonshine being produced and are widely believed to on average consume the largest amount of alcohol in China.

===Language and script===

The Wa language forms a language group belonging to the Palaungic branch of the Austroasiatic language family. It formerly had no script and the few Wa who were literate used Chinese characters, while others used the Shan language and its script. Christian missionary work among the Wa began at the beginning of the 20th century first in the Burmese and later in the Chinese areas of the Wa territory. It was led by William Marcus Young of Nebraska. The first transcription of the Wa language was devised by Young and Sara Yaw Shu Chin in 1931 with the purpose of translating the Bible. This first Wa alphabet was based on the Latin script and the first publication was a compilation of Wa hymns in 1933, the Wa New Testament being completed in 1938. This transcription, known as &quot;Bible orthography&quot; is known as &quot;&quot; () in Chinese, and is now used mainly in the Burmese Wa areas and among the Wa in Thailand. A revised Bible orthography has been adopted as &quot;official Wa spelling&quot; by the authorities of the Wa Self-Administered Division in Pangkham, which have published a series of primers in order to improve the literacy of the United Wa State Army troops. Also, after 2000 Wa people in social networks such as Facebook and other online media, as well as Wa songwriters in karaoke lyrics of Wa songs use this Myanmar (revised Bible) &quot;official Wa orthography&quot; in its main variations.

In China, a transcription adapted to the new pinyin romanization, known as &quot;PRC orthography&quot; or &quot;China official orthography&quot;, was developed for the Wa people in 1956. However, its publications, mainly propagated through the Yunnan administration, are yet to reach a wider public beyond academics. This new Wa alphabet is treated as the first formal script of the Wa.

The Western Lawa are officially considered part of the Wa minority in China and are also known as &#x27;tame Wa&#x27;.

=== British rule and enduring prejudices ===

Very little has been written about the Wa people except in the Chinese language. The area where they live had been traditionally administered by a &quot;Saopha&quot;, a Shan hereditary chief. In the second half of the 19th century, the British authorities in Burma judged the Wa territory remote and of difficult access. Thus, excepting Mang Lon where the &quot;Saopha&quot; resided, the British left the Wa State without administration, its border with China undefined. That situation suited the Wa well, for throughout their history they had consistently preferred being left alone.

The Wa were largely portrayed by colonial administrators as wild and dirty people owing to their practice of headhunting. However, Chinese documents written prior to the twentieth century rarely mentioned the Wa as headhunters and yet it is this aspect of Wa culture that has been cited more than any other in order to emphasize the primitiveness of the Wa.

The prejudice continues in modern times when the Wa, who are economically not that different from other ethnic hill tribes in the area such as the Lahu people, are largely known for their rebel army and as being involved in drug trafficking, overshadowing other aspects of their culture.

=== Post World War II ===

The international border that had been defined between Burma and China made that the Wa people were divided between the two countries. The Wa regions in Burma were largely left alone until the 1950s, when remnants of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army fled the 1949 Chinese Communist Revolution. A decade and a half later, the region was under the influence of the Communist Party of Burma, which was very active in the area. During that time opium cultivation and sales grew and the ancient traditional life became disrupted, but also an administrative system that collected revenue and maintained a significant armed force, as well as a rudimentary infrastructure, ushered the Wa region into the modern era.

In 1989 the Wa authorities expelled the Burma Communist Party and negotiated a cease-fire with the then leader of Burma&#x27;s military junta Khin Nyunt. They founded the United Wa State Army and United Wa State Party with a centralized command. In return for agreeing to the ban of poppy cultivation and opium production the region experienced a massive influx of international development aid. The Wa Special Region 2 was created within the northeastern Shan State, with its de facto capital in Pangkham.

=== Military activity and drug production ===
The United Wa State Army was one of the world&#x27;s largest narco-armies, with up to 10,000 men under arms. Until 1996 the UWSA was involved in a conflict against the Mong Tai Army which suited the objectives of the Tatmadaw in the area. During this conflict the Wa army occupied areas close to the Thai border, ending up with the control of two separate swathes of territory north and south of Kengtung. In 1999 when the Burmese military requested the Wa fighters to return to the northern area the UWSA refused.

During the 1990s the areas controlled by the UWSA were involved in heroin production. During the 2000s, the United Wa State Army shifted focus into amphetamine production. Records of official seizures compiled by the United Nations suggest that in 2006 Myanmar was the source of half of Asia&#x27;s methamphetamine, known in Thailand as yaba, and some experts believe that most drug labs are in areas under Wa control.

== Geographic distribution ==
The land where the Wa have been traditionally living is divided between Burma and China. The international border cuts the ancestral Wa region roughly in half.
===China===
The Wa are one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by China.
In China, the Wa live in compact communities in the Ximeng Va Autonomous County (in Wa: &quot;Mēng Ka&quot; or &quot;Si Moung&quot;), Cangyuan Va Autonomous County, Menglian Dai, Lahu and Va Autonomous County (&quot;Gaeng Līam&quot;), Gengma Dai and Va Autonomous County (&quot;Gaeng Mīex&quot; or &quot;Gaeng Māx&quot;), Lincang (&quot;Mēng Lām&quot;), Shuangjiang Lahu, Va, Blang and Dai Autonomous County (&quot;Si Nblāeng&quot; or &quot;Mēng Mēng&quot;), Zhenkang County, and Yongde County in southwestern Yunnan. Their population in China is estimated at 400,000.

====Benren====
The &quot;Benren&quot; () of Yongde County and Zhenkang County, Yunnan are officially classified as Wa by the Chinese government, but consider themselves to be a separate ethnicity from the Wa. Their autonym is &quot;Siwa&quot; (). The Benren are distributed in:

*Menggong Township (recently incorporated into Dedang Town ), Yongde County: in Menggong , Daba , Songlin , Dapingzhang , Hunai , Xiaodifang , Lielie . There are 10,289 Benren in the township as of 2010.
*Desili Township , Fengqing County
*Mangka Township , Cangyuan Va Autonomous County

===Burma===

The Wa are one of the 135 officially recognized ethnic groups of Myanmar. Their proportion to Myanmar&#x27;s total population is 0.16. Although little is known about the ancient history of the Wa, they are acknowledged by other dominant ethnic groups in Shan State, such as the Tai Yai, to be the original inhabitants of the area.

In Burma, the Wa live mostly in small villages near Kengtung and north and northeastwards close to the Chinese border, as well as a small area east of Tachileik. The Wa Special Region 2 of the Northern Shan State or Wa State was formed by the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the remains of the former Burmese Communist Party rebel group that collapsed in 1989. The Wa State and the UWSA are in a fragile cease-fire agreement with the Burmese military government. They have been accused by Western governments of involvement in drug trafficking but have banned opium production since 2005 and have received United Nations aid in improving legitimate agriculture.

As stipulated by the 2008 Burmese Constitution, on 20 August 2010 the Wa Self-Administered Division has been established. It is set to be administered by the Wa people and its territory is between the gorges of the Mekong and Salween, in the east part of the Shan State, near the border with the Chinese province of Yunnan.

===Thailand===
In recent times some Wa communities from Burma have crossed the border and settled in Thailand, where they have no official status as a Hill Tribe. The Wa live mainly in the Mae Sai District and Mae Yao subdistrict of Chiang Rai Province, as well as in Wiang Pa Pao District in southern Chiang Rai Province and Chiang Dao District in Chiang Mai Province. In Thailand the Wa having come recently from Burma are often referred to as &#x27;Lawa&#x27;, although they do not strictly belong to the latter ethnic subgroup.

<doc id="162932" wikidata="Q319947" url="?curid=162932" title="Longinus">
<text>Longinus (Greek: Λογγίνος) is the name given to the unnamed Roman soldier who pierced the side of Jesus with a lance, who in medieval and some modern Christian traditions is described as a convert to Christianity. His name first appeared in the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus. The lance is called in Christianity the &quot;Holy Lance&quot; (&quot;lancea&quot;) and the story is related in the Gospel of John during the Crucifixion. This act is said to have created the last of the Five Holy Wounds of Christ.

This person, unnamed in the Gospels, is further identified in some versions of the story as the centurion present at the Crucifixion, who said that Jesus was the son of God, so he is considered as one of the first Christians and Roman converts. Longinus&#x27; legend grew over the years to the point that he was said to have converted to Christianity after the Crucifixion, and he is traditionally venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and several other Christian communions.

==Origins of the History==
No name for this soldier is given in the canonical Gospels; the name &quot;Longinus&quot; is instead found in the apocryphal &quot;Gospel of Nicodemus&quot;. Longinus was not originally a saint in Christian tradition. An early tradition, found in a sixth- or seventh-century pseudepigraphal &quot;Letter of Herod to Pilate&quot;, claims that Longinus suffered for having pierced Jesus, and that he was condemned to a cave where every night a lion came and mauled him until dawn, after which his body healed back to normal, in a pattern that would repeat until the end of time. Later traditions turned him into a Christian convert, but as Sabine Baring-Gould observed: &quot;The name of Longinus was not known to the Greeks previous to the patriarch Germanus, in 715. It was introduced among the Westerns from the Apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus. There is no reliable authority for the Acts and martyrdom of this saint.&quot;

The name is probably Latinized into a common cognomen of the Cassia gens, from the Greek (), the word used for the spear mentioned in John . It first appears lettered on an illumination of the Crucifixion beside the figure of the soldier holding a spear, written, perhaps contemporaneously, in horizontal Greek letters, , in the Syriac gospel manuscript illuminated by a certain Rabulas in the year 586, in the Laurentian Library, Florence. The spear used is known as the Holy Lance, and more recently, especially in occult circles, as the &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, which was revered at Jerusalem by the sixth century, although neither the centurion nor the name &quot;Longinus&quot; were invoked in any surviving report. As the &quot;Lance of Longinus&quot;, the spear figures in the legends of the Holy Grail.

Blindness or other eye problems are not mentioned until after the tenth century. Petrus Comestor was one of the first to add an eyesight problem to the legend and his text can be translated as &quot;blind&quot;, &quot;dim-sighted&quot; or &quot;weak-sighted&quot;. The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; says that he saw celestial signs before conversion and that his eye problems might have been caused by illness or age. The touch of Jesus&#x27;s blood cures his eye problem:

The body of Longinus is said to have been lost twice, but discovered at Mantua, together with the Holy Sponge stained with Christ&#x27;s blood, wherewith it was told—extending Longinus&#x27; role—that Longinus had assisted in cleansing Christ&#x27;s body when it was taken down from the cross. The relic enjoyed a revived cult in the late 13th century under the patronage of the Bonacolsi.

The relics are said to have been divided and then distributed to Prague (St. Peter and Paul Basilica, Vyšehrad) and elsewhere. Greek sources assert that he suffered martyrdom in Cappadocia. The Russian Orthodox Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, Washington, DC purports to have a holy relic, a fragment of bone, of Saint Longinus.

==Present-day veneration==

Longinus is venerated, generally as a martyr, in the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church. His feast day is kept on 16 October in the Roman Martyrology, which mentions him, without any indication of martyrdom, in the following terms: &quot;At Jerusalem, commemoration of Saint Longinus, who is venerated as the soldier opening the side of the crucified Lord with a lance&quot;. The pre-1969 feast day in the Roman Rite is 15 March. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him on 16 October. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, his feast is commemorated on 22 October.

The statue of &quot;Saint Longinus&quot;, sculpted by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, is one of four in the niches beneath the dome of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Vatican City. A spearpoint fragment said to be from the Holy Lance is also conserved in the Basilica.

Longinus and his legend are the subject of the Moriones Festival held during Holy Week on the island of Marinduque, the Philippines.

Hagiographical fragments on St. Longinus from 11th–13th century found in Dubrovnik indicate his veneration in this area in Middle Ages. There is altarpiece &quot;St. Longinus and St. Gaudentius&quot; by an anonymous author from 17th century in St. Anthony the Great Catholic parish church in Veli Lošinj.

The Longinus cross (German: Longinuskreuz) is a special form of the Arma Christi cross, which occurs mainly in the Black Forest, but also occasionally in other regions of South Germany.

===Brazil===
====Folkloric role====
In Brazil, Saint Longinus – in Portuguese, &quot;São Longuinho&quot; – is attributed the power of finding missing objects. The saint&#x27;s aid is summoned by the chant:

Folk tradition explains the association with missing objects with a tale from the saint&#x27;s days in Rome. It is said he was of short stature and, as such, had unimpeded view of the underside of tables in crowded parties. Due to this, he would find and return objects dropped on the ground by the other attendants.

Accounts vary regarding the promised offering of three hops, citing either deference to an alleged limping of the saint or a plea to the Holy Trinity.

====Brazilian spiritism====
Brazilian medium Chico Xavier wrote &quot;Brasil, Coração do Mundo, Pátria do Evangelho&quot;, a psychographic book of authorship attributed to the spirit of Humberto de Campos. In the book, Saint Longinus is claimed to have been reincarnated as Pedro II, the last Brazilian emperor.

<doc id="162939" wikidata="Q1007042" url="?curid=162939" title="GNU Compiler for Java">
<text>The GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) is a discontinued free compiler for the Java programming language. It was part of the GNU Compiler Collection.

GCJ compiles Java source code to Java virtual machine (JVM) bytecode or to machine code for a number of CPU architectures. It could also compile class files and whole JARs that contain bytecode into machine code.

==History==
The GCJ runtime-libraries original source is from GNU Classpath project, but there is a code difference between the codice_1 libraries. GCJ 4.3 uses the Eclipse Compiler for Java as a front-end.

In 2007, a lot of work was done to implement support for Java&#x27;s two graphical APIs in GNU Classpath: AWT and Swing. Software support for AWT is still in development. &quot;Once AWT support is working then Swing support can be considered. There is at least one free-software partial implementations of Swing that may be usable.&quot;. The GNU CLASSPATH was never completed to even Java 1.2 status and now appears to have been abandoned completely.

As of 2015, there were no new developments announced from GCJ and the product was in maintenance mode, with open-source Java toolchain development mostly happening within OpenJDK. GCJ was removed from the GCC trunk on September 30, 2016. Announcement of its removal was made with the release of the GCC 7.1, which does not contain it. GCJ remains part of GCC 6.

==Performance==
The compilation function in GCJ should have a faster start-up time than the equivalent bytecode launched in a JVM when compiling Java code into machine code.

==Compiled Native Interface (CNI)==
The Compiled Native Interface (CNI), previously named &quot;Cygnus Native Interface&quot;, is a software framework for the GCJ that allows Java code to call, and be called by, native applications (programs specific to a hardware and operating-system platform) and libraries written in C++.

CNI closely resembles the JNI (Java Native Interface) framework which comes as a standard with various Java virtual machines.

===Comparison of language use===
The authors of CNI claim for various advantages over JNI:

CNI depends on Java classes appearing as C++ classes. For example,
given a Java class,
public class Int
 public int i;
 public Int(int i) { this.i = i; }
 public static Int zero = new Int(0);


one can use the class thus:
#include &lt;gcj/cni.h&gt;
#include &lt;Int&gt;

Int *mult(Int *p, int k)
 if (k == 0)
 return Int::zero; // Static member access.
 return new Int(p-&gt;i * k);


==See also==
* Excelsior JET (Excelsior Java native code compiler)
* IcedTea
* Kaffe
* SableVM
* JamVM
* Apache Harmony
* Jikes
* GraalVM - GraalVM&#x27;s Native Image functionality is an ahead-of-time compilation technology that produces executable binaries of class files.
* Java virtual machine
* Free Java implementations
* Kotlin - Kotlin/Native is a technology for compiling Kotlin to native binaries that run without any JVM. It comprises a LLVM-based backend for the Kotlin compiler and a native implementation of the Kotlin runtime library.

<doc id="162947" wikidata="Q163891" url="?curid=162947" title="St. Bartholomew's Day massacre">
<text>The Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre () in 1572 was a targeted group of assassinations and a wave of Catholic mob violence directed against the Huguenots (French Calvinist Protestants) during the French Wars of Religion. Traditionally believed to have been instigated by Queen Catherine de&#x27; Medici, the mother of King Charles IX, the massacre started a few days after the marriage on 18 August of the king&#x27;s sister Margaret to the Protestant King Henry III of Navarre. Many of the wealthiest and most prominent Huguenots had gathered in largely Catholic Paris to attend the wedding.

The massacre began in the night of 23–24 August 1572, the eve of the Feast of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle, two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the military and political leader of the Huguenots. King Charles IX ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny, and the slaughter spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks in all, the massacre expanded outward to the countryside and other urban centres. Modern estimates for the number of dead across France vary widely, from 5,000 to 30,000.

The massacre marked a turning point in the French Wars of Religion. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, and many rank-and-file members subsequently converted. Those who remained became increasingly radicalised. Though by no means unique, the bloodletting &quot;was the worst of the century&#x27;s religious massacres&quot;. Throughout Europe, it &quot;printed on Protestant minds the indelible conviction that Catholicism was a bloody and treacherous religion&quot;.

==Background==
The Massacre of Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Day was the culmination of a series of events:
*The Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which put an end to the third War of Religion on 8 August 1570.
*The marriage between Henry III of Navarre and Margaret of Valois on 18 August 1572.
*The failed assassination of Admiral de Coligny on 22 August 1572.

=== Unacceptable peace and marriage ===
The Peace of Saint-Germain put an end to three years of civil war between Catholics and Protestants. This peace, however, was precarious, since the more intransigent Catholics refused to accept it. The strongly Catholic Guise family was out of favour at the French court; the Huguenot leader, Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, was readmitted into the king&#x27;s council in September 1571. Staunch Catholics were shocked by the return of Protestants to the court, but the queen mother, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, and her son, Charles IX, were practical in their support of peace and Coligny, as they were conscious of the kingdom&#x27;s financial difficulties and the Huguenots&#x27; strong defensive position: they controlled the fortified towns of La Rochelle, La Charité-sur-Loire, Cognac, and Montauban.

To cement the peace between the two religious parties, Catherine planned to marry her daughter Margaret to the Protestant Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV), son of the Huguenot leader Queen Jeanne d&#x27;Albret. The royal marriage was arranged for 18 August 1572. It was not accepted by traditionalist Catholics or by the Pope. Both the Pope and King Philip II of Spain strongly condemned Catherine&#x27;s Huguenot policy as well.

===Tension in Paris===

The impending marriage led to the gathering of a large number of well-born Protestants in Paris, but Paris was a violently anti-Huguenot city, and Parisians, who tended to be extreme Catholics, found their presence unacceptable. Encouraged by Catholic preachers, they were horrified at the marriage of a princess of France to a Protestant. The Parlement&#x27;s opposition and the court&#x27;s absence from the wedding led to increased political tension.

Compounding this bad feeling was the fact that the harvests had been poor and taxes had risen. The rise in food prices and the luxury displayed on the occasion of the royal wedding increased tensions among the common people. A particular point of tension was an open-air cross erected on the site of the house of , a Huguenot who had been executed in 1569. The mob had torn down his house and erected a large wooden cross on a stone base. Under the terms of the peace, and after considerable popular resistance, this had been removed in December 1571 (and re-erected in a cemetery), which had already led to about 50 deaths in riots, as well as mob destruction of property. In the massacres of August, the relatives of the Gastines family were among the first to be killed by the mob.

The court itself was extremely divided. Catherine had not obtained Pope Gregory XIII&#x27;s permission to celebrate this irregular marriage; consequently, the French prelates hesitated over which attitude to adopt. It took all the queen mother&#x27;s skill to convince the Cardinal de Bourbon (paternal uncle of the Protestant groom, but himself a Catholic clergyman) to marry the couple. Beside this, the rivalries between the leading families re-emerged. The Guises were not prepared to make way for their rivals, the House of Montmorency. François, Duke of Montmorency and governor of Paris, was unable to control the disturbances in the city. On 20 August, he left the capital and retired to Chantilly.

===Shift in Huguenot thought===
In the years preceding the massacre, Huguenot political rhetoric had for the first time taken a tone against not just the policies of a particular monarch of France, but monarchy in general. In part this was led by an apparent change in stance by John Calvin in his &quot;Readings on the Prophet Daniel&quot;, a book of 1561, in which he had argued that when kings disobey God, they &quot;automatically abdicate their worldly power&quot; – a change from his views in earlier works that even ungodly kings should be obeyed. This change was soon picked up by Huguenot writers, who began to expand on Calvin and promote the idea of the sovereignty of the people, ideas to which Catholic writers and preachers responded fiercely.

Nevertheless, it was only in the aftermath of the massacre that anti-monarchical ideas found widespread support from Huguenots, among the &quot;Monarchomachs&quot; and others. &quot;Huguenot writers, who had previously, for the most part, paraded their loyalty to the Crown, now called for the deposition or assassination of a Godless king who had either authorised or permitted the slaughter&quot;. Thus, the massacre &quot;marked the beginning of a new form of French Protestantism: one that was openly at war with the crown. This was much more than a war against the policies of the crown, as in the first three civil wars; it was a campaign against the very existence of the Gallican monarchy itself&quot;.

===Huguenot intervention in the Netherlands===
Tensions were further raised when in May 1572 the news reached Paris that a French Huguenot army under Louis of Nassau had crossed from France to the Netherlandish province of Hainaut and captured the Catholic strongholds of Mons and Valenciennes (now in Belgium and France, respectively). Louis governed the Principality of Orange around Avignon in southern France for his brother William the Silent, who was leading the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish. This intervention threatened to involve France in that war; many Catholics believed that Coligny had again persuaded the king to intervene on the side of the Dutch, as he had managed to do the previous October, before Catherine had got the decision reversed.

===Attempted assassination of Admiral de Coligny===

After the wedding of Catholic Marguerite de Valois and Huguenot Henry de Navarre on 18 August 1572, Coligny and the leading Huguenots remained in Paris to discuss some outstanding grievances about the Peace of St. Germain with the king. An attempt was made on Coligny&#x27;s life a few days later on 22 August as he made his way back to his house from the Louvre. He was shot from an upstairs window, and seriously wounded. The would-be assassin, most likely Charles de Louviers, Lord of Maurevert(–1583), escaped in the ensuing confusion. Other theories about who was ultimately responsible for the attack centre on three candidates:

*The Guises: the Cardinal of Lorraine (who was in Rome at the time), and his nephews, the Dukes of Guise and Aumale, are the most likely suspects. The leaders of the Catholic party, they wanted to avenge the death of the two dukes&#x27; father Francis, Duke of Guise, whose assassination ten years earlier they believed to have been ordered by Coligny. The shot aimed at Admiral de Coligny came from a house belonging to the Guises.
*The Duke of Alba: he governed the Netherlands on behalf of Philip II. Coligny planned to lead a campaign in the Netherlands to participate in the Dutch Revolt to free the region from Spanish control. During the summer, Coligny had secretly dispatched a number of troops to help the Protestants in Mons, who were now besieged by the Duke of Alba. So Admiral de Coligny was a real threat to the latter.
*Catherine de&#x27; Medici: according to tradition, the Queen Mother had been worried that the king was increasingly becoming dominated by Coligny. Among other things, Catherine reportedly feared that Coligny&#x27;s influence would drag France into a war with Spain over the Netherlands.

==Massacres==
===Paris===
The attempted assassination of Coligny triggered the crisis that led to the massacre. Admiral de Coligny was the most respected Huguenot leader and enjoyed a close relationship with the king, although he was distrusted by the king&#x27;s mother. Aware of the danger of reprisals from the Protestants, the king and his court visited Coligny on his sickbed and promised him that the culprits would be punished. While the Queen Mother was eating dinner, Protestants burst in to demand justice, some talking in menacing terms. Fears of Huguenot reprisals grew. Coligny&#x27;s brother-in-law led a 4,000-strong army camped just outside Paris and, although there is no evidence it was planning to attack, Catholics in the city feared it might take revenge on the Guises or the city populace itself.

That evening, Catherine held a meeting at the Tuileries Palace with her Italian advisers, including Albert de Gondi, Comte de Retz. On the evening of 23 August, Catherine went to see the king to discuss the crisis. Though no details of the meeting survive, Charles IX and his mother apparently made the decision to eliminate the Protestant leaders. Holt speculated this entailed &quot;between two and three dozen noblemen&quot; who were still in Paris. Other historians are reluctant to speculate on the composition or size of the group of leaders targeted at this point, beyond the few obvious heads. Like Coligny, most potential candidates for elimination were accompanied by groups of gentlemen who served as staff and bodyguards, so murdering them would also have involved killing their retainers as a necessity.

Shortly after this decision, the municipal authorities of Paris were summoned. They were ordered to shut the city gates and arm the citizenry to prevent any attempt at a Protestant uprising. The king&#x27;s Swiss mercenaries were given the task of killing a list of leading Protestants. It is difficult today to determine the exact chronology of events, or to know the precise moment the killing began. It seems probable that a signal was given by ringing bells for matins (between midnight and dawn) at the church of Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois, near the Louvre, which was the parish church of the kings of France. The Swiss mercenaries expelled the Protestant nobles from the Louvre Castle and then slaughtered them in the streets.
In the Holy Innocents&#x27; Cemetery, on 24 August at noon, a hawthorn bush, that had withered for months, began to green again near an image of the Virgin. That was interpreted by the Parisians as a sign of divine blessing and approval to these multiple murders, and that night, a group led by Guise in person dragged Admiral Coligny from his bed, killed him, and threw his body out of a window. The terrified Huguenot nobles in the building initially put up a fight, hoping to save the life of their leader, but Coligny himself seemed unperturbed. According to the contemporary French historian Jacques Auguste de Thou, one of Coligny&#x27;s murderers was struck by how calmly he accepted his fate, and remarked that &quot;he never saw anyone less afraid in so great a peril, nor die more steadfastly&quot;. 

The tension that had been building since the Peace of St. Germain now exploded in a wave of popular violence. The common people began to hunt Protestants throughout the city, including women and children. Chains were used to block streets so that Protestants could not escape from their houses. The bodies of the dead were collected in carts and thrown into the Seine. The massacre in Paris lasted three days despite the king&#x27;s attempts to stop it. Holt concludes that &quot;while the general massacre might have been prevented, there is no evidence that it was intended by any of the elites at court&quot;, listing a number of cases where Catholic courtiers intervened to save individual Protestants who were not in the leadership. Recent research by Jérémie Foa, investigating the prosopography suggests that the massacres were carried by a group of militants who had already made out lists of Protestants deserving extermination, and the mass of the population, whether approving or disapproving, were not directly involved.

The two leading Huguenots, Henry of Navarre and his cousin the Prince of Condé (respectively aged 19 and 20), were spared as they pledged to convert to Catholicism; both would eventually renounce their conversions when they managed to escape Paris. According to some interpretations, the survival of these Huguenots was a key point in Catherine&#x27;s overall scheme, to prevent the House of Guise from becoming too powerful.

On 26 August, the king and court established the official version of events by going to the Paris Parlement. &quot;Holding a lit de justice, Charles declared that he had ordered the massacre in order to thwart a Huguenot plot against the royal family.&quot; A jubilee celebration, including a procession, was then held, while the killings continued in parts of the city.

===Provinces===

Although Charles had dispatched orders to his provincial governors on 24 August to prevent violence and maintain the terms of the 1570 edict, from August to October, similar massacres of Huguenots took place in a total of twelve other cities: Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lyon, Bourges, Rouen,
Orléans, Meaux, Angers, La Charité, Saumur, Gaillac and Troyes. In most of them, the killings swiftly followed the arrival of the news of the Paris massacre, but in some places there was a delay of more than a month. According to Mack P. Holt: &quot;All twelve cities where provincial massacres occurred had one striking feature in common; they were all cities with Catholic majorities where there had once been &quot;significant&quot; Protestant minorities... All of them had also experienced serious religious division... during the first three civil wars... Moreover seven of them shared a previous experience ... [they] had actually been taken over by Protestant minorities during the first civil war...&quot;
In several cases the Catholic party in the city believed they had received orders from the king to begin the massacre, some conveyed by visitors to the city, and in other cases apparently coming from a local nobleman or his agent. It seems unlikely any such orders came from the king, although the Guise faction may have desired the massacres. 

Apparently genuine letters from the Duke of Anjou, the king&#x27;s younger brother, did urge massacres in the king&#x27;s name; in Nantes the mayor fortunately held on to his without publicising it until a week later when contrary orders from the king had arrived. In some cities the massacres were led by the mob, while the city authorities tried to suppress them, and in others small groups of soldiers and officials began rounding up Protestants with little mob involvement. In Bordeaux the inflammatory sermon on 29 September of a Jesuit, Edmond Auger, encouraged the massacre that was to occur a few days later.

In the cities affected, the loss to the Huguenot communities after the massacres was numerically far larger than those actually killed; in the following weeks there were mass conversions to Catholicism, apparently in response to the threatening atmosphere for Huguenots in these cities. In Rouen, where some hundreds were killed, the Huguenot community shrank from 16,500 to fewer than 3,000 mainly as a result of conversions and emigration to safer cities or countries. Some cities unaffected by the violence nevertheless witnessed a sharp decline in their Huguenot population. It has been claimed that the Huguenot community represented as much as 10% of the French population on the eve of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, declining to 7–8% by the end of the 16th century, and further after heavy persecution began once again during the reign of Louis XIV, culminating with the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.

Soon afterward both sides prepared for a fourth civil war, which began before the end of the year.

===Death toll===

Estimates of the number that perished in the massacres have varied from 2,000 by a Roman Catholic apologist to 70,000 by the contemporary Huguenot Maximilien de Béthune, who himself barely escaped death. Accurate figures for casualties have never been compiled, and even in writings by modern historians there is a considerable range, though the more specialised the historian, the lower they tend to be. At the low end are figures of about 2,000 in Paris and 3,000 in the provinces, the latter figure an estimate by Philip Benedict in 1978. Other estimates are about 10,000 in total, with about 3,000 in Paris and 7,000 in the provinces. At the higher end are total figures of up to 20,000, or 30,000 in total, from &quot;a contemporary, non-partisan guesstimate&quot; quoted by the historians Felipe Fernández-Armesto and D. Wilson. 

For Paris, the only hard figure is a payment by the city to workmen for collecting and burying 1,100 bodies washed up on the banks of the Seine downstream from the city in one week. Body counts relating to other payments are computed from this.

Among the slain were the philosopher Petrus Ramus, and in Lyon the composer Claude Goudimel. The corpses floating down the Rhône from Lyon are said to have put the people of Arles off drinking the water for three months.

==Reactions==
The Politiques, those Catholics who placed national unity above sectarian interests, were horrified, but many Catholics inside and outside France initially regarded the massacres as deliverance from an imminent Huguenot coup d&#x27;etat. The severed head of Coligny was apparently dispatched to Pope Gregory XIII, though it got no further than Lyon, and the pope sent the king a Golden Rose. The pope ordered a Te Deum to be sung as a special thanksgiving (a practice continued for many years after) and had a medal struck with the motto &quot;Ugonottorum strages 1572&quot; (Latin: &quot;Overthrow (or slaughter) of the Huguenots 1572&quot;) showing an angel bearing a cross and a sword before which are the felled Protestants.
 Pope Gregory XIII also commissioned the artist Giorgio Vasari to paint three frescos in the Sala Regia depicting the wounding of Coligny, his death, and Charles IX before Parliament, matching those commemorating the defeat of the Turks at the Battle of Lepanto (1571). &quot;The massacre was interpreted as an act of divine retribution; Coligny was considered a threat to Christendom and thus Pope Gregory XIII designated 11 September 1572 as a joint commemoration of the Battle of Lepanto and the massacre of the Huguenots.&quot;

Although these formal acts of rejoicing in Rome were not repudiated publicly, misgivings in the papal curia grew as the true story of the killings gradually became known. Pope Gregory XIII himself refused to receive Charles de Maurevert, said to be the killer of Coligny, on the ground that he was a murderer.

On hearing of the slaughter, Philip II of Spain supposedly &quot;laughed, for almost the only time on record&quot;. In Paris, the poet Jean-Antoine de Baïf, founder of the , wrote a sonnet extravagantly praising the killings. On the other hand, the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian II, King Charles&#x27;s father-in-law, was sickened, describing the massacre as a &quot;shameful bloodbath&quot;. Moderate French Catholics also began to wonder whether religious uniformity was worth the price of such bloodshed and the ranks of the Politiques began to swell.

The massacre caused a &quot;major international crisis&quot;. Protestant countries were horrified at the events, and only the concentrated efforts of Catherine&#x27;s ambassadors, including a special mission by Gondi, prevented the collapse of her policy of remaining on good terms with them. Elizabeth I of England&#x27;s ambassador to France at that time, Sir Francis Walsingham, barely escaped with his life. Even Tsar Ivan the Terrible expressed horror at the carnage in a letter to the Emperor.

The massacre &quot;spawned a mass of polemical literature, bubbling with theories, prejudices and phobias&quot;. Many Catholic authors were exultant in their praise of the king for his bold and decisive action (after regretfully abandoning a policy of meeting Huguenot demands as far as he could) against the supposed Huguenot coup, whose details were now fleshed out in officially sponsored works, though the larger mob massacres were somewhat deprecated: &quot;[one] must excuse the people&#x27;s fury moved by a laudable zeal which is difficult to restrain once it has been stirred up&quot;. Huguenot works understandably dwelt on the harrowing details of violence, expounded various conspiracy theories that the royal court had long planned the massacres, and often showed extravagant anti-Italian feelings directed at Catherine, Gondi, and other Italians at court.

Diplomatic correspondence was readier than published polemics to recognise the unplanned and chaotic nature of the events, which also emerged from several accounts in memoirs published over the following years by witnesses to the events at court, including the famous &quot;Memoirs&quot; of Margaret of Valois, the only eye-witness account of the massacre from a member of the royal family. 

There is also a dramatic and influential account by Henry, duke of Anjou that was not recognised as fake until the 19th century. Anjou&#x27;s supposed account was the source of the quotation attributed to Charles IX: &quot;Well then, so be it! Kill them! But kill them all! Don&#x27;t leave a single one alive to reproach me!&quot;
The author of the &quot;Lettre de Pierre Charpentier&quot; (1572) was not only &quot;a Protestant of sorts, and thus, apparently, writing with inside knowledge&quot;, but also &quot;an extreme apologist for the massacre ... in his view ... a well-merited punishment for years of civil disobedience [and] secret sedition...&quot; A strand of Catholic writing, especially by Italian authors, broke from the official French line to applaud the massacre as precisely a brilliant stratagem, deliberately planned from various points beforehand. The most extreme of these writers was Camilo Capilupi, a papal secretary, whose work insisted that the whole series of events since 1570 had been a masterly plan conceived by Charles IX, and carried through by frequently misleading his mother and ministers as to his true intentions. The Venetian government refused to allow the work to be printed there, and it was eventually published in Rome in 1574, and in the same year quickly reprinted in Geneva in the original Italian and a French translation.

It was in this context that the massacre came to be seen as a product of Machiavellianism, a view greatly influenced by the Huguenot Innocent Gentillet, who published his &quot;Discours contre Machievel&quot; in 1576, which was printed in ten editions in three languages over the next four years. Gentillet held, quite wrongly according to Sydney Anglo, that Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;books [were] held most dear and precious by our Italian and Italionized courtiers&quot; (in the words of his first English translation), and so (in Anglo&#x27;s paraphrase) &quot;at the root of France&#x27;s present degradation, which has culminated not only in the St Bartholemew massacre but the glee of its perverted admirers&quot;. In fact there is little trace of Machiavelli in French writings before the massacre, and not very much after, until Gentillet&#x27;s own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the long-lasting popular concept of Machiavellianism. It also gave added impetus to the strong anti-Italian feelings already present in Huguenot polemic.

Christopher Marlowe was one of many Elizabethan writers who were enthusiastic proponents of these ideas. In the &quot;Jew of Malta&quot; (1589–90) &quot;Machievel&quot; in person speaks the Prologue, claiming to not be dead, but to have possessed the soul of the Duke of Guise, &quot;And, now the Guise is dead, is come from France/ To view this land, and frolic with his friends&quot; (Prologue, lines 3–4) His last play, &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot; (1593) takes the massacre, and the following years, as its subject, with Guise and Catherine both depicted as Machiavellian plotters, bent on evil from the start. The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 was still ready to endorse a version of this view, describing the massacres as &quot;an entirely political act committed in the name of the immoral principles of Machiavellianism&quot; and blaming &quot;the pagan theories of a certain raison d&#x27;état according to which the end justified the means&quot;.

The French 18th-century historian Louis-Pierre Anquetil, in his &quot;Esprit de la Ligue&quot; of 1767, was among the first to begin impartial historical investigation, emphasising the lack of premeditation (before the attempt on Coligny) in the massacre and that Catholic mob violence had a history of uncontrollable escalation. By this period the Massacre was being widely used by Voltaire (in his &quot;Henriade&quot;) and other Enlightenment writers in polemics against organised religion in general. Lord Acton changed his mind on whether the massacre had been premeditated twice, finally concluding that it was not. The question of whether the massacre had long been premeditated was not entirely settled until the late 19th century by which time a consensus was reached that it was not.

==Interpretations==
===Role of the royal family===

Over the centuries, the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre has aroused a great deal of controversy. Modern historians are still divided over the responsibility of the royal family:

The traditional interpretation makes Catherine de&#x27; Medici and her Catholic advisers the principal culprits in the execution of the principal military leaders. They forced the hand of a hesitant and weak-willed king in the decision of that particular execution. This traditional interpretation has been largely abandoned by some modern historians including, among others, Janine Garrisson. However, in a more recent work than his history of the period, Holt concludes: &quot;The ringleaders of the conspiracy appear to have been a group of four men: Henry, duke of Anjou; Chancellor Birague; the duke of Nevers, and the comte de Retz&quot; (Gondi). Apart from Anjou, the others were all Italian advisors at the French court.

According to Denis Crouzet, Charles IX feared a Protestant uprising, and chose to strangle it at birth to protect his power. The execution decision was therefore his own, and not Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s.

According to Jean-Louis Bourgeon, the violently anti-Huguenot city of Paris was really responsible. He stresses that the city was on the verge of revolt. The Guises, who were highly popular, exploited this situation to put pressure on the King and the Queen Mother. Charles IX was thus forced to head off the potential riot, which was the work of the Guises, the city militia and the common people.

According to Thierry Wanegffelen, the member of the royal family with the most responsibility in this affair is Henry, Duke of Anjou, the king&#x27;s ambitious younger brother. Following the failed assassination attack against the Admiral de Coligny (which Wanegffelen attributes to the Guise family and Spain), the Italian advisers of Catherine de&#x27; Medici undoubtedly recommended in the royal council the execution of about fifty Protestant leaders. These Italians stood to benefit from the occasion by eliminating the Huguenot danger. Despite the firm opposition of the Queen Mother and the King, Anjou, Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, present at this meeting of the council, could see a good occasion to make a name for himself with the government. He contacted the Parisian authorities and another ambitious young man, running out of authority and power, Duke Henri de Guise (whose uncle, the clear-sighted Charles, cardinal of Lorraine, was then detained in Rome).

The Parisian St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre resulted from this conjunction of interests, and this offers a much better explanation as to why the men of the Duke of Anjou acted in the name of the Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, consistent with the thinking of the time, rather than in the name of the King. One can also understand why, the day after the start of the massacre, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, through royal declaration of Charles IX, condemned the crimes, and threatened the Guise family with royal justice. However, when Charles IX and his mother learned of the involvement of the duke of Anjou, and being so dependent on his support, they issued a second royal declaration, which, while asking for an end to the massacres, credited the initiative with the desire of Charles IX to prevent a Protestant plot. Initially the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of the duke of Anjou was a success, but Catherine de&#x27; Medici went out of her way to deprive him from any power in France: she sent him with the royal army to remain in front of La Rochelle and then had him elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

===Role of the religious factions===
Traditional histories have tended to focus more on the roles of the political notables whose machinations began the massacre than the mindset of those who actually did the killing. Ordinary lay Catholics were involved in the mass killings; they believed they were executing the wishes of the king and of God. At this time, in an age before mass media, &quot;the pulpit remained probably the most effective means of mass communication&quot;.

Despite the large numbers of pamphlets and broadsheets in circulation, literacy rates were still poor. Thus, some modern historians have stressed the critical and incendiary role that militant preachers played in shaping ordinary lay beliefs, both Catholic and Protestant.

Historian Barbara B. Diefendorf, Professor of History at Boston University, wrote that Simon Vigor had &quot;said if the King ordered the Admiral (Coligny) killed, &#x27;it would be wicked not to kill him&#x27;. With these words, the most popular preacher in Paris legitimised in advance the events of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day&quot;. Diefendorf says that when the head of the murdered Coligny was shown to the Paris mob by a member of the nobility, with the claim that it was the King&#x27;s will, the die was cast. Another historian Mack P. Holt, Professor at George Mason University, agrees that Vigor, &quot;the best known preacher in Paris&quot;, preached sermons that were full of references to the evils that would befall the capital should the Protestants seize control. This view is also partly supported by Cunningham and Grell (2000) who explained that &quot;militant sermons by priests such as Simon Vigor served to raise the religious and eschatological temperature on the eve of the Massacre&quot;.

Historians cite the extreme tension and bitterness that led to the powder-keg atmosphere of Paris in August 1572. In the previous ten years there had already been three outbreaks of civil war, and attempts by Protestant nobles to seize power in France. Some blame the complete esteem with which the sovereign&#x27;s office was held, justified by prominent French Roman Catholic theologians, and that the special powers of French Kings &quot;...were accompanied by explicit responsibilities, the foremost of which was combating heresy&quot;.

Holt, notable for re-emphasising the importance of religious issues, as opposed to political/dynastic power struggles or socio-economic tensions, in explaining the French Wars of Religion, also re-emphasised the role of religion in the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. He noted that the extra violence inflicted on many of the corpses &quot;was not random at all, but patterned after the rites of the Catholic culture that had given birth to it&quot;. &quot;Many Protestant houses were burned, invoking the traditional purification by fire of all heretics. Many victims were also thrown into the Seine, invoking the purification by water of Catholic baptism&quot;. Viewed as a threat to the social and political order, Holt argues that &quot;Huguenots not only had to be exterminated – that is, killed – they also had to be humiliated, dishonoured, and shamed as the inhuman beasts they were perceived to be.&quot;

However Raymond Mentzer points out that Protestants &quot;could be as bloodthirsty as Catholics. Earlier Huguenot rage at Nimes (in 1567) led to... the massacre of twenty-four Catholics, mostly priests and prominent laymen, at the hands of their Protestant neighbours. Few towns escaped the episodic violence and some suffered repeatedly from both sides. Neither faith had a monopoly on cruelty and misguided fervour&quot;.

Some, like Leonie Frieda, emphasise the element within the mob violence of the &quot;haves&quot; being &quot;killed by the &#x27;have-nots&#x27;&quot;. Many Protestants were nobles or bourgeois and Frieda adds that &quot;a number of bourgeois Catholic Parisians had suffered the same fate as the Protestants; many financial debts were wiped clean with the death of creditors and moneylenders that night&quot;. At least one Huguenot was able to buy off his would-be murderers.

The historian H.G. Koenigsberger (who until his retirement in 1984 was Professor of History at King&#x27;s College, University of London) wrote that the Massacre was deeply disturbing because &quot;it was Christians massacring other Christians who were not foreign enemies but their neighbours with which they and their forebears had lived in a Christian community, and under the same ruler, for a thousand years&quot;. He concludes that the historical importance of the Massacre &quot;lies not so much in the appalling tragedies involved as their demonstration of the power of sectarian passion to break down the barriers of civilisation, community and accepted morality&quot;.

One historian puts forward an analysis of the massacre in terms of social anthropology – the religious historian Bruce Lincoln. He describes how the religious divide, which gave the Huguenots different patterns of dress, eating and pastimes, as well as the obvious differences of religion and (very often) class, had become a social schism or cleavage. The rituals around the royal marriage had only intensified this cleavage, contrary to its intentions, and the &quot;sentiments of estrangement – radical otherness – [had come] to prevail over sentiments of affinity between Catholics and Protestants&quot;.

On 23 August 1997, Pope John Paul II, who was in Paris for the 12th World Youth Day, issued a statement on the Massacre. He stayed in Paris for three days and made eleven speeches. According to Reuters and the Associated Press, at a late-night vigil, with the hundreds of thousands of young people who were in Paris for the celebrations, he made the following comments: &quot;On the eve of Aug. 24, we cannot forget the sad massacre of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day, an event of very obscure causes in the political and religious history of France. ... Christians did things which the Gospel condemns. I am convinced that only forgiveness, offered and received, leads little by little to a fruitful dialogue, which will in turn ensure a fully Christian reconciliation. ... Belonging to different religious traditions must not constitute today a source of opposition and tension. On the contrary, our common love for Christ impels us to seek tirelessly the path of full unity.&quot;

==Cultural references==

The Elizabethan dramatist Christopher Marlowe knew the story well from the Huguenot literature translated into English, and probably from French refugees who had sought refuge in his native Canterbury. He wrote a strongly anti-Catholic and anti-French play based on the events entitled &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot;. Also, in his biography &quot;The World of Christopher Marlowe&quot;, David Riggs claims the incident remained with the playwright, and massacres are incorporated into the final acts of three of his early plays, &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2 Tamburlaine&quot; and &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot; – see above for Marlowe and Machiavellism.

The story was also taken up in 1772 by Louis-Sébastien Mercier in his play &quot;Jean Hennuyer, Bishop of Lizieux&quot;, unperformed until the French Revolution. This play was translated into English, with some adaptations, as &quot;The Massacre&quot; by the actress and playwright Elizabeth Inchbald in 1792. Inchbald kept the historical setting, but &quot;The Massacre&quot;, completed by February 1792, also reflected events in the recent French Revolution, though not the September Massacres of 1792, which coincided with its printing.

Joseph Chénier&#x27;s play &quot;Charles IX&quot; was a huge success during the French Revolution, drawing strongly anti-monarchical and anti-religious lessons from the massacre. Chénier was able to put his principles into practice as a politician, voting for the execution of Louis XVI and many others, perhaps including his brother André Chénier. However, before the collapse of the Revolution he became suspected of moderation, and in some danger himself.
The story was fictionalised by Prosper Mérimée in his &quot;A Chronicle of the Reign of Charles IX&quot; (1829), and by Alexandre Dumas, père in &quot;La Reine Margot&quot;, an 1845 novel that fills in the history as it was then seen with romance and adventure. That novel has been translated into English and was made first into a commercially successful French film in 1954, &quot;La reine Margot&quot; (US title &quot;A Woman of Evil&quot;), starring Jeanne Moreau. It was remade in 1994 as &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; (later as &quot;Queen Margot&quot;, and subtitled, in English-language markets), starring Isabelle Adjani.
Giacomo Meyerbeer&#x27;s opera &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; (1836), very loosely based on the events of the massacre, was one of the most popular and spectacular examples of French grand opera.

The Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais managed to create a sentimental moment in the massacre in his painting &quot;A Huguenot, on St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day&quot; (1852), which depicts a Catholic woman attempting to convince her Huguenot lover to wear the white scarf badge of the Catholics and protect himself. The man, true to his beliefs, gently refuses her. Millais was inspired to create the painting after seeing Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;.

Mark Twain described the massacre in &quot;From the Manuscript of &#x27;A Tramp Abroad&#x27; (1879): The French and the Comanches&quot;, an essay about &quot;partly civilized races&quot;. He wrote in part, &quot;St. Bartholomew&#x27;s was unquestionably the finest thing of the kind ever devised and accomplished in the world. All the best people took a hand in it, the King and the Queen Mother included.&quot;

The St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre and the events surrounding it were incorporated into D.W. Griffith&#x27;s film &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916). The film follows Catherine de&#x27; Medici (Josephine Crowell) plotting the massacre, coercing her son King Charles IX (Frank Bennett) to sanction it. Incidental characters include Henri of Navarre, Marguerite de Valois (Constance Talmadge), Admiral Coligny (Joseph Henabery), and the Duke of Anjou, who is portrayed as homosexual. These historic scenes are depicted alongside a fictional plot in which a Huguenot family is caught among the events.

Another novel depicting this massacre is &quot;Queen Jezebel&quot;, by Jean Plaidy (1953). In the third episode of the BBC miniseries &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (1971), starring Glenda Jackson as Queen Elizabeth I of England, the English court&#x27;s reaction to the massacre and its effect on England&#x27;s relations with France is addressed in depth.

A 1966 serial in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; entitled &quot;The Massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot; is set during the events leading up to the Paris massacre. Leonard Sachs appeared as Admiral Coligny and Joan Young played Catherine de&#x27; Medici. This serial is missing from the BBC archives and survives only in audio form. It depicts the massacre as having been instigated by Catherine de&#x27; Medici for both religious and political reasons, and authorised by a weak-willed and easily influenced Charles IX.

The St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre is the setting for Tim Willocks&#x27; historical novel, &quot;The Twelve Children of Paris&quot; (Matthias Tannhauser Trilogy:2), published in 2013.

Ken Follett&#x27;s 2017 historical fiction novel &quot;A Column of Fire&quot; uses this event. Several chapters depict in great detail the massacre and the events leading up to it, with the book&#x27;s protagonists getting some warning in advance and making enormous but futile efforts to avert it. Follett completely clears King Charles IX and his mother Catherine of any complicity and depicts them as sincere proponents of religious toleration, caught by surprise and horrified by the events; he places the entire responsibility on the Guise Family, following the &quot;Machiavellian&quot; view of the massacre and depicting it as a complicated Guise conspiracy, meticulously planned in advance and implemented in full detail.

The second season finale of &quot;The Serpent Queen&quot; depicts the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s massacre.

<text>The Isle of Thanet () is a peninsula forming the easternmost part of Kent, England. While in the past it was separated from the mainland by the Wantsum Channel, it is no longer an island.

Archaeological remains testify to its settlement in ancient times. Today, it is a tourist destination, and has an active agricultural base.

==Etymology==
The island of Thanet is mentioned as &quot;Tonetic&quot; (c. AD 150; the TON- of this form was misread as TOΛI-, hence it appears as &quot;Toliatis&quot; in the surviving manuscripts of Ptolemy); &quot;Tanat&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Athanatos&quot; and &quot;Thanatos&quot; (in various copies of 3rd C AD, Solinus); &quot;Tanatos&quot; (AD 731); &quot;Tenid&quot; in 679 and &quot;Tenet&quot; (e.g. charters of AD 679, 689 and thereafter); and the Old Welsh forms &quot;Tanet&quot; and &quot;Danet&quot;, found in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (c. AD 829/30) and Armes Prydein (c. AD 930). 

Standard reference works for English place-names (such as Eilert Ekwall&#x27;s &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names&quot;) state the name &quot;Tanet&quot; is known to be Brythonic in origin. Commonly the original meaning of Thanet is thought to be &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;bright island&quot; (&quot;tân&quot; in Modern Welsh and &quot;tan&quot; in Breton means fire), and this has led to speculation the island was home to an ancient beacon or lighthouse.

Another theory states that &quot;Tanet&quot; is a common European toponymic creation of Celtic origin, based on the Celtic word &quot;*tanno-&quot; meaning &quot;holm oak&quot; (compare Breton &quot;tann&quot; &quot;sort of oak&quot;, Cornish &quot;glastannen&quot; &quot;holm oak&quot;) and the Celtic suffix &quot;*-etu&quot;, to mean a collection of trees. Thanet would mean &quot;place of the holm oaks&quot;, such as the Northern French Thenney (Eure, &quot;Thaneth&quot; ab. 1050); Tennie (Sarthe, &quot;Tanida&quot; 9th century) or the Italian Tanedo (Lombardy, &quot;Tanetum&quot;, Tite-Live).
A third theory suggests that the origin of the toponym is the name of the Punic goddess Tanit.

The 7th-century Archbishop Isidore of Seville recorded an apocryphal folk-etymology in which the island&#x27;s name is fancifully connected with the Greek word for death (Thanatos/Θάνατος), stating that Thanet, &quot;an island of the ocean separated from Britain by a narrow channel ... [was] called &quot;Tanatos&quot; from the death of serpents; for while it has none of its own, soil taken from it to any place whatsoever kills snakes there.&quot;

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, written in the 9th century, states that &quot;&quot;Tanet&quot; was the name used for the island by the legendary Jutes Hengist and Horsa, while its name in Old Welsh was &quot;Ruoi(c)hin&quot;&quot;; this name may be translated as &quot;gift&quot; (&quot;rhwych&quot; in Modern Welsh).

Other names used by Britons were &quot;&quot;Ruim&quot; and &quot;Ruochim Inis&quot;&quot;.

==History==
Archaeological evidence shows that the area now known as the Isle of Thanet was one of the major areas of Stone Age settlement. A large hoard of Bronze Age implements has been found at Minster-in-Thanet; and several Iron Age settlements have also come to light.

Julius Caesar made two attempts to invade Britain, in both 55 and 54 BC. In 2017 archaeologists from the University of Leicester excavated a Roman fort covering up to at Ebbsfleet, and dated it to around 55–50 BC. They further linked it to Caesar&#x27;s invasion of Britain in 54 BC, and suggested that the invading force arrived in nearby Pegwell Bay. Nearly a century later, in 43 AD, Claudius sent four legions to Britain, where the Romans were to remain for the next 400 years. During that time the port of Richborough, on the opposite side of the Wantsum Channel, became one of the chief ports of Roman Britain.

According to the eighth-century ecclesiastical historian Bede, Vortigern, King of the Britons, was under attack from other tribes and called for assistance. Among those who came in 449 were the Jutes Hengist and Horsa; Vortigern is said to have rewarded them with the Isle of Thanet in return for their services. As the following extract from the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (first written sometime shortly after 833) testifies:
This story, however, is possibly an example of non-historical founding myths, though one constructed with political objectives in mind. It has been noted that Alfred&#x27;s version of the Saxon Chronicles omitted the death of Horsa. In reality, it appears to have been settled by Jutes under Visigothic authority between 476-517 AD, though they may have been present earlier as Foederati. These were followed by Ingaevones in the sixth century.

Throughout this time the Isle remained an island. The Wantsum Channel allowed ships to sail between the mainland and the island in calm waters. The Saxon Chronicle recounts that in 1052 Earl Godwin after obtaining hostages and provisions from Sandwich sailed through the &quot;Wantsume&quot; towards &quot;Northmuth&quot; and &quot;Lundene&quot;. Gradually this silted up, and the last ship sailed through the Channel in 1672.

In 597 Augustine of Canterbury is said, by Bede, to have landed with 40 men at Ebbsfleet, in the parish of Minster-in-Thanet, before founding Britain&#x27;s second Christian monastery in Canterbury (the first was founded fifty years earlier by Columba on Eileach an Naoimh in the Hebrides): a cross marks the spot.
Isidore of Seville wrote c.615-30 A.D. of the Isle of Thanet: &quot;Tanatos insula Oceani freto Gallico, a Brittania aestuario tenui separata, frumentariis campis et gleba uberi. Dicta autem Tanatos a morte serpentum, quos dum ipsa nesciat, asportata inde terra quoquo gentium vecta sit, angues ilico perimit&quot;Which translates as: &quot;Thanet is an island in the Ocean in the Gallic (i.e. English) channel, separated from Britannia by a narrow estuary, with fruitful fields and rich soil. It is named Thanet (Tanatos) from the death of serpents (cf.“death”)&quot;Following the raids on the Isle of Sheppey commencing in 832, Thanet became a regular target for Viking attacks, its vulnerable coastal monasteries providing convenient targets for the invaders. In 851 and again in 854, the Vikings overwintered in Thanet and continued their raids in spring. In 853 there was a battle in Thanet against the Vikings and both Elcherel the leader of the men from Kent, and Huda the leader of the men from Surrey were killed.

Thanet&#x27;s monasteries were subsequently used by the Danes as feasting halls or general headquarters.

In 865, the Great Heathen Army encamped in Thanet and was promised by the people of Kent danegeld in exchange for peace. Regardless, the Vikings did not abide by this agreement and proceeded to rampage across eastern Kent. Some time between 978 and 989 (sources differ) raiders entirely destroyed Minster Abbey by arson together with those sheltering in the abbey.

In 969, King Edgar ordered all of Thanet to be plundered.

In 980, Thanet was over run by the Vikings.

In 1047, those in Thanet successfully resisted a Viking raid of 25 ships that had plundered elsewhere including Sandwich.

The 1085 survey of the Domesday Book revealed that Thanet had as tenants-in-chief the See of Canterbury and the Abbey of St Augustine, separated into the abbey-manors of St. Mildred&#x27;s (larger) and Monocatune (Monkton, Monks-town). Households of 239 villeins, 71 others and 3 knights were mentioned. The land of these two abbey-manors was separated by a strip of land called a balk and known as Cursus Cerve or St Mildred’s Lynch. It is documented on an early map of Thanet and is associated with the hind symbol used in Thanet and the path of a hind that defined the land assigned to St. Mildred&#x27;s in the  Kentish Royal Legend.

By 1334–1335 Thanet had the highest population density in Kent according to King Edward III&#x27;s lay subsidy rolls. Margate is mentioned in 1349, in a dispute about the land of Westgate Manor. Thanet acted as a granary for Calais, whose governor for Edward III was so assigned to administer. Edward III also required local fortifications to be constructed where boats and ships could land. Documents towards the end of that century refer to turreted walls beneath the cliffs needing maintenance. Coastal erosion has long since destroyed these structures.

Counted households had increased to 532 when reported during the reign of Elizabeth I.

The first Earl of Thanet was created in 1628.

By 1807 the island roads were deemed to be good infrastructure for the time without turnpikes although one was soon established at Ramsgate. The wheat crop was excellent helped with sea weed fertiliser processes.

==Governance==
Margate was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1857 and Ramsgate in 1884. Broadstairs and St Peter&#x27;s Urban District and the Isle of Thanet Rural District covered the rest of the island from 1894 until 1974. By 1974, however, all these boroughs and districts had been abolished, and since that year the Isle of Thanet has formed the major part of the District of Thanet.

==Geology==
The Isle is formed almost wholly of chalk, a soft pure white limestone of Cretaceous age, specifically the Margate Chalk Member (Santonian to Campanian) traditionally referred to simply as the &#x27;Margate Chalk&#x27;, and sometimes as the ‘Margate Member’. It is a sub-division of the Newhaven Chalk Formation. Beneath this and outcropping around the margins of the Isle is the Seaford Chalk Formation which contains relatively more flint nodules and seams. It has also been referred to as the ‘Broadstairs Member’. The Seaford Chalk is of Coniacian to Santonian age whilst the Margate Chalk is of Santonian to Campanian age. Both were traditionally referred to the ‘Upper Chalk’ but are now classed as parts of the ‘White Chalk Subgroup’ as part of the broader Chalk Group.

Overlying the chalk both within the Wantsum Channel and in patches on the surface of the Isle itself are the thick sands, silts and clays of the Palaeogene age Thanet Formation (formerly the Thanet Beds). The area gives its name to the internationally recognised Thanetian, descriptive of rocks of this particular part of the Palaeocene throughout the world. Brickearth head deposits lie within many of the shallow chalk valleys and across some areas of flatter ground within the Isle.

==Geography==
The Isle of Thanet formed when sea levels rose after the last glacial period, around 5000 BC. The North Sea encroached on the land which is now the estuary of the River Thames, and southwards to reach the higher land of the North Downs, leaving behind an island composed of chalk in its wake. Eventually the sea broke through river valleys in the North Downs to the south (Middle Chalk) and finally today&#x27;s English Channel was opened up. The proto-River Stour then formed part of the intervening water, with a new tributary, the River Wantsum, completing it; it became known as the Wantsum Channel.

The Wantsum Channel gradually narrowed as pebble beaches built up at the southern end of the strait, blocking silt coming down the Stour. There was also previously a stream called the Nethergong on the western side that had its outlet at Northmouth (Yenlade) about to the east of Reculver. Bede, in the 8th century, said that the Channel was then three furlongs wide (). A map of 1414 showed a ferry crossing at Sarre. The first wooden bridge over the channel was built there in reign of Henry the Seventh. Until the mid 18th century there was a ferry between Sandwich and the island; in 1755 a wooden drawbridge was built, and the ferry was closed.

Today the Isle is an island no longer and the erstwhile channel is now flat marshland criss-crossed by drainage ditches. Meanwhile, the exposed chalk cliffs are gradually being worn down by the sea, particularly at the North Foreland. Much else of the coast is a built-up area. The Wantsum area is still liable to flooding: during the North Sea flood of 1953 Thanet was cut off for a few days, but the sea defences have been strengthened since then.

The soil and equable climate of the Isle have always encouraged arable farming.

Today there are still farms inland, but the coast is nearly all covered in settlements, most of which have come into being in the 19th and 20th centuries.

As the popularity of the seaside resort grew, so did that of the Isle of Thanet. At first the holidaymakers came by boat from London; after the coming of the railways in the mid-1840s, that became the preferred mode of transport. The population grew, as the following population statistics show:

==Landmarks==
The principal landmarks on the Isle are the North Foreland, and all the bays around the coastline, the principal ones of which are Minnis Bay, Palm Bay, Botany Bay, Joss Bay, and Pegwell Bay: the latter being part of the estuary of the River Stour. In 2007, seven of those beaches met stringent quality standards and were awarded as Blue Flag beaches: Minnis Bay, Botany Bay (Broadstairs), Margate Main Sands, St Mildreds Bay (Westgate), Stone Bay (Broadstairs), West Bay (Westgate), and Westbrook Bay. In 2008, this had risen to 10 beaches.

==Transport==
The rail connections are via the Chatham Main Line through Margate to Ramsgate, and the Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) Line. A high-speed rail link from London to Thanet began in December 2009, and forms part of the UK&#x27;s first true high-speed commuter service, according to the South Eastern Railway Company. The Thanet Loop bus service connects Margate, Ramsgate, and Broadstairs. Main road links are the A28, which brings traffic from Canterbury and Ashford; and the A299, north coast route. The Thanet Coastal Path skirts the coast.

There is an airport at Manston, formerly RAF Manston, but since renamed by its commercial operators as Manston Airport. The airport is no longer in operation.

Ferry services (predominantly freight and car with passengers) were operated by Transeuropa Ferries to Continental Europe from the Port of Ramsgate but ceased in 2013.

A tramway was once operated by the Isle of Thanet Electric Tramways and Lighting Company from Westbrook to Ramsgate from 1901 to 1937. The tramway had a narrow gauge of .

<doc id="162958" wikidata="Q363942" url="?curid=162958" title="Pierre Harmel">
<text>Pierre Charles José Marie, Count Harmel (; 16 March 1911 – 15 November 2009) was a Belgian lawyer, Christian Democratic politician and diplomat. Harmel served as the prime minister of Belgium from 1965 to 1966.

==Early life==
He was born in Uccle, son of father Charles Harmel and mother Eusibie André. He studied law at the University of Liège (Liège), where he obtained the titles of Doctor of Laws and Master of Social Science in 1933. During his studies, he was active in the Association catholique belge, of which he became the chairman in 1938.

Mobilized in 1940, he took part in the 18 days Campaign. In 1947, he was appointed professor of law at the University of Liège.

==Political career==

===Early political career===
Member of the PSC-CVP since its creation in 1945, Harmel was elected deputy for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 17 February 1946. He would keep his seat without interruption until 1971.

Harmel represented Belgium at the fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1949. He subsequently was member of several governments in the 1950s and 1960s.

===School War===

During his period as Minister of Education (8 June 1950 until 22 April 1954), Harmel increased the wages of teachers in private (i.e. Catholic) schools and introduced laws linking the subsidies for private schools to the number of pupils. These measures were perceived by the secularists (i.e. the anti-clerical Liberals and Socialists) as a declaration of war. When the 1954 elections brought to power a coalition of Socialists and Liberals, the new Education Minister, Leo Collard, immediately set out to reverse the measures taken by his predecessor, sparking mass protests by the Catholic bloc. A compromise was eventually found by the next government (a Catholic minority government led by Gaston Eyskens), and the &quot;School War&quot; was concluded by 6 November 1958 School Pact. André Molitor was one of the chief architects of the school pact.

===Minister of Justice, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs===
Harmel was Minister of Justice in the second government led by Gaston Eyskens (23 June 1958 – 6 November 1958), and then Minister of Culture (6 November 1958 – 3 September 1960) and Minister of the Civil Service (3 September 1960 – 25 April 1961) in the third Eyskens cabinet.

Prime Minister of Belgium from 28 July 1965 until 19 March 1966, Harmel led a coalition comprising Christian Democrats and Socialists. Finally, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Liberal-Christian Democratic coalition led by Paul Vanden Boeynants (19 March 1966 – 7 February 1968). As Foreign Minister he chaired the opening meeting of the enlargement negotiations between the EEC and the four applicants for Community membership in June 1970. Indeed, Harmel&#x27;s opening statement to the enlargement conference has since formed the basis of the Community opening position for future enlargement discussions.
====Harmel Doctrine====

As Minister of Foreign Affairs, he submitted a report titled &quot;Future Tasks of the Alliance&quot; to the NATO council of ministers. The report, which was approved by the council in December 1967, contained the so-called &quot;Harmel Doctrine&quot;. It advocated a strong defence combined with good diplomatic relations with the countries of the Warsaw Pact. The Harmel Doctrine helped to pave the way for the east–west détente of the early 1970s, which led to the 1975 Helsinki Summit and the creation of the OSCE. Harmel himself visited several Warsaw Pact countries.

===Later career===
After 25 years in the Chamber of Deputies, Harmel was Senator from 1971 until 1977. He was made a Minister of State from 1973. In 1988, he was awarded an honorary doctorate at the Catholic University of Louvain, and in 1991, was raised into the Belgian nobility by King Baudouin with the hereditary title of &quot;Count Harmel&quot; (Dutch: graaf Harmel).

==Personal life==
Harmel was married to Marie-Claire Van Gehuchten from 22 May 1946. Together they had 6 children, four sons and two daughters. Harmel died on 15 November 2009 at the age of 98. His wife died in 2018.

<doc id="162962" wikidata="Q1422517" url="?curid=162962" title="Kenya African National Union">
<text>The Kenya African National Union (KANU) is a Kenyan political party that ruled for nearly 40 years after Kenya&#x27;s independence from British colonial rule in 1963 until its electoral loss in 2002. It was known as Kenya African Union (KAU) from 1944 but due to pressure from the colonial government, KAU changed its name to Kenya African Study Union (KASU) mainly because all political parties were banned in 1939 following the start of the Second World War. In 1946 KASU rebranded itself into KAU following the resignation of Harry Thuku as president due to internal differences between the moderates who wanted peaceful negotiations and the militants who wanted to use force, the latter forming the Aanake a forty (The forty Group), which later became the Mau Mau. His post was then occupied by James Gichuru, who stepped down for Jomo Kenyatta in 1947 as president of KAU. The KAU was banned by the colonial government from 1952 to 1960. It was re-established by James Gichuru in 1960 and renamed KANU on 14 May 1960 after a merger with Tom Mboya&#x27;s Kenya Independence Movement.

==History==
===Origins and Kenyatta===
The Kenya African Union was a political organization formed in 1944 to articulate Kenyan grievances against the British colonial administration. The KAU attempted to be more inclusive than the Kikuyu Central Association by recruiting membership across the colony of Kenya.

From October 1952 to December 1959, Kenya was under a state of emergency arising from the armed Mau Mau rebellion against British colonial rule. What prompted the imposition of the state of emergency, by sir Evelyn Baring, was the assassination of one Chief Waruhiu who was an alleged British informer among many other reasons. KAU, the national political movement for Africans was banned in 1952 and its leaders including Jomo Kenyatta imprisoned in 1953. Kikuyu, Embu and Meru political involvement was restricted heavily in this period in response to the insurrection. During this period however, African participation in the political process increased rapidly throughout the colony of Kenya. Starting in 1954 the colonial government started to actively promote regional tribal based political parties led by leaders friendly to the colonial government. The colonial government governor then appointed these leaders of the tribal parties to the Legislative Council in 1956. Ronald Ngala was appointed to represent the Coast region, Daniel Moi was appointed to represent Rift Valley, Masinde Muliro was appointed to represent Western while Argwings Kodhek was appointed to represent Nairobi while Oginga Odinga became the Nyanza LegCo member. Jeremiah James Nyaga was appointed to represent Central Kenya. A ban on nationalist political parties however remained in force in Kenya until 1960.

The first direct elections for Africans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957. The majority of the &#x27;moderate&#x27; and friendly leaders appointed to the Council by the colonial government were re-elected to the Council in 1957. The only exception was Tom Mboya, who ran as an independent and defeated Argwings Kodhek, who had been appointed by the colonial government to represent Nairobi in 1956.

The ban for national political movements was lifted in 1960. On 14 May 1960, KAU (having been resurrected by James Gichuru) merged with Tom Mboya&#x27;s Kenya Independence Movement and the Nairobi People&#x27;s Convention Party to form the Kenya African National Union (KANU) with Tom Mboya as its first secretary general and James Gichuru as KANU chairman. Oginga Odinga was the KANU first vice chairman.

The Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) was founded in 1960, to challenge KANU. KADU&#x27;s aim was to defend the interests of the tribes so-called KAMATUSA (an acronym for Kalenjin, Maasai, Turkana and Samburu) as well as the European settler community, against the dominance of the larger Luo and Kĩkũyũ tribes that comprised the majority of KANU&#x27;s membership (Kenyatta himself being a Kikuyu). KANU was in favour of immediate total independence, a new independence constitution and universal suffrage while KADU was supporting the continuation of the colonial political system established by the &quot;Lyttelton Constitution&quot; of 1954 with federalism (Majimbo) as KADU&#x27;s key tenets. Despite the numerical advantage lying with the numerically stronger KANU, a form of Federalism involving Kenya&#x27;s 8 provinces was adopted in Kenya&#x27;s independence as a result of British colonial government supporting KADU&#x27;s plan. After independence KANU nonetheless decided to remove all provisions of a federal nature from the constitution.

Kenyatta was released in 1961, and the KANU contested the 1961 Kenyan general election (winning a plurality of the seats and 67.50% of the popular vote). Following the implementation of a new colonial constitution (the key feature of which were a bicameral legislature consisting of a 117-member House of Representatives and a 41-member Senate, and the elimination of reserved seats for ethnic minorities), the KANU contested and won a majority of the votes and seats in the 1963 Kenyan general election. Kenya became independent on December 12, 1963. Jomo Kenyatta, head of the KANU, became Kenya&#x27;s first prime minister.

===Independence===

KADU dissolved itself voluntarily in 1964 and joined KANU after a strong lobbying by Tom Mboya. In this year, Kenya became a republic within the Commonwealth, with Kenyatta as its first president.

A small but significant leftist opposition party, the Kenya People&#x27;s Union (KPU), was formed in 1966, led by Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, a former vice president and Luo elder. The KPU was banned and its leader detained after political unrest related to Kenyatta&#x27;s visit to Nyanza Province that resulted in the Kisumu massacre. No new opposition parties were formed after 1969, and KANU became the sole political party. At Kenyatta&#x27;s death in August 1978, Vice President Daniel arap Moi, a former KADU member became interim President. On October 14, Moi became president formally after he was elected head of KANU and designated its sole nominee.

===One-party state and return to democracy===
In June 1982, the National Assembly amended the constitution, making Kenya officially a one-party state. Parliamentary elections were held in September 1983. The 1988 elections reinforced the one-party system. However, in December 1991, parliament repealed the one-party section of the constitution. By early 1992, several new parties had formed, and multiparty elections were held in December 1992.

President Moi was reelected for another 5-year term. Opposition parties won about 45% of the parliamentary seats, but President Moi&#x27;s KANU Party obtained the majority of seats. Parliamentary reforms in November 1997 enlarged the democratic space in Kenya, including the expansion of political parties from 11 to 26. President Moi won re-election as president in the December 1997 elections, and his KANU Party narrowly retained its parliamentary majority, with 109 out of 212 seats.

===2002 elections===
At the 2002 legislative national elections, the party won an overall 29.0% of the popular vote and 64 out of 212 elected seats. In the presidential elections of the same day, the party&#x27;s candidate Uhuru Kenyatta won 31.3% of the vote, and was thereby defeated by Mwai Kibaki from the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) party with 62.2%. On December 29, 2002, the Kenyan electoral commission confirmed that the former opposition NARC party had achieved a landslide victory over the ruling KANU party, thus bringing to an end 40 years of single party rule and 24 years of rule by Daniel arap Moi.

===Post-2002===
The political parties ODM-Kenya and Orange Democratic Movement both came into existence out of this movement. The smaller faction, headed by Nicholas Biwott and supported by Daniel arap Moi was opposed to the direction Kenyatta was taking the party. The two factions briefly patched up their differences under the mediation of former party leader Daniel Moi; the result being KANU did not field a presidential candidate in Kenya&#x27;s disputed general election of 2007, backing instead the incumbent Mwai Kibaki.

===Uhuru Kenyatta and Moi in 2007===
In September 2007, Kenyatta announced that he would not run for the presidency and would support Kibaki&#x27;s re-election, sinking any hopes that KANU would back the Orange Democratic Movement. William Ruto however remained in ODM applying for the presidential candidacy. Of particular interest is that Uhuru&#x27;s statement came soon after Moi&#x27;s declaration that he would back current president Kibaki&#x27;s re-election bid.
KANU is part of the Party of National Unity (PNU), a coalition party behind Kibaki. However, unlike other PNU member parties, only KANU had clearance to field its own parliamentary and civic candidates. Since the coming into force of the Political Parties act of 2011, differences have once again emerged over the future of the party with a faction led by Gideon Moi accusing Uhuru Kenyatta of neglecting the party. Kenyatta, and his supporters, eventually quit the party altogether and in December 2012, KANU entered a four party coalition, including the National Vision Party, United Democratic Movement and New Ford Kenya, to field a single presidential candidate at the 2013 general elections.

==Ideology==
Upon its inception in 1960, KANU included politicians of various ideologies, including African socialism, which was highlighted in the immediate post-independence period. However, with the adoption of Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965 in Kenya&#x27;s parliament and the resignation of left-leaning politicians allied to Oginga Odinga, it pursued a mixed market economic policy, with state intervention in the form of parastatals. It steered Kenya to side with the West during the Cold War, with both Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Moi using apparent links to the Soviet Union as pretexts to crush political dissent.

==Structure==
KANU&#x27;s leadership structure consists of a national chairman, a secretary general, and several national vice chairmen. All these officials are elected at a national delegates conference. (The last full election was in 2005 and it saw Uhuru Kenyatta, who has since quit the party, confirmed as party chairman.)

Delegates who participate at the national elections are selected through the party&#x27;s constituency level branches.

==Past holders of the Chairman position==
* 1960 to 1962 – James Gichuru (acting for Kenyatta)
* 1961 to 1978 – Jomo Kenyatta
* 1978 to 2005 – Daniel arap Moi
* 2005 to 2012 – Uhuru Kenyatta
