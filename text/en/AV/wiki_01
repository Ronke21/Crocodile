<text>Brian Nielsen (born 1 April 1965) is a Danish former professional boxer and Olympic bronze medalist. He held the IBO heavyweight title from 1996 to 1999 successfully defending it five times, including against Larry Holmes and Phil Jackson, the second highest number of defenses behind Wladimir Klitschko&#x27;s record of 18. At one point of time, he equaled Rocky Marciano&#x27;s record of 49 successive wins with no losses. While he never held a world title from any of the main four sanctioning bodies (WBC, IBF, WBA, WBO), he did defeat several former world champions who had, including James Smith, Jeff Lampkin, Tony Tubbs, Carlos De León, Tim Witherspoon, Orlin Norris, and Uriah Grant.

==Amateur career==
As an amateur, Nielsen won bronze medals in the super heavyweight division at the 1991 European Championships and the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.

Brian Nielsen was sent to Svendborg, where Johnny Antonsen had arranged a match against the local hero Carsten Dahl. Nielsen easily beat Dahl, winning the bout by knockout in the second round. Dahl later got the opportunity for revenge, but again Nielsen won by knockout.

He was both Zealand champion and Danish champion for five consecutive years (1988-1992), and also won numerous international tournaments. His career as an amateur ended after the Olympics in Barcelona in 1992 where he won the bronze. In the semifinals he lost to the powerful Cuban Roberto Balado. Balado won 15 to 1.

In total, Nielsen boxed 111 fights as an amateur and won 104. He only took a count once in amateur career, and only once was he stopped before time - during the 1989 European Championship bout, where he suffered a cut near one of his eyes. His opponent at this match was the Greek boxer George Tsachakis who attended the final.

==Professional career==
After his win over 41-year-old ex-World Boxing Association champion James &#x27;Bonecrusher&#x27; Smith in October 1994, Nielsen began to attract attention. He went on to hold the minor IBO belt during an unbeaten streak equaling that of legend Rocky Marciano. He later held the minor IBC belt.

===Tyson fight===
On 13 October 2001, Nielsen fought Mike Tyson at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen. After six rounds heavily in Tyson&#x27;s favour, Nielsen quit on his stool citing an eye injury. Nielsen was knocked down once in the third round.

===Announced comeback and Holyfield fight===
On February 8, 2010, Brian Nielsen told reporters that he was prepared to return to the ring, after 8 years of absence, and that a proposed fight against Evander Holyfield had been met with interest by both sides. Though originally thought unrealistic by former promoter Mogens Palle, due to Nielsen&#x27;s bad knee, Nielsen&#x27;s comeback was confirmed by Nielsen&#x27;s promoter Sauerland Event on June 1, 2010.

Nielsen met Holyfield on May 7, 2011 in a World Boxing Federation (WBF) title bout, in Copenhagen. Holyfield won the fight, knocking Nielsen down in the 3rd with a left hook and stopping him by TKO in the 10th.

=== Match throwing incident ===

Controversy arose in early 2004, when journeyman heavyweight Thomas Williams stated that he had been bribed to throw his fight against Nielsen in March, 2000. Along with promoter Robert Mitchell, Williams was indicted by the United States District Court for the District of Nevada for match fixing in order to promote the career of Richie Melito, and it was during the FBI&#x27;s investigation of that case that Williams admitted to intentionally losing to Nielsen. The fix was arranged by promoter Robert Mittleman, a frequent associate of Nielsen&#x27;s promoter Mogens Palle, who later confessed that he had been paid $1,000, while Williams had received &quot;up to $40,000&quot; from Palle in order to lose the fight. Williams, Mitchell and Mittleman were all found guilty of sports bribery by the court in November and December, 2004.

The Nielsen vs. Williams fight was the 57th of Nielsen&#x27;s career. Nielsen and Mogens Palle denied any knowledge of the match fixing, and were not charged of any wrongdoing by American or Danish authorities.

<doc id="157592" wikidata="Q207213" url="?curid=157592" title="Saturnalia">
<text>Saturnalia is an ancient Roman festival and holiday in honour of the god Saturn, held on 17 December in the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities until 19 December. By the 1st century BC, the celebration had been extended until 23 December, for a total of seven days of festivities. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms: gambling was permitted, and masters provided table service for their slaves as it was seen as a time of liberty for both slaves and freedmen alike. A common custom was the election of a &quot;King of the Saturnalia&quot;, who gave orders to people, which were followed and presided over the merrymaking. The gifts exchanged were usually gag gifts or small figurines made of wax or pottery known as &quot;sigillaria&quot;. The poet Catullus called it &quot;the best of days&quot;.

Saturnalia was the Roman equivalent to the earlier Greek holiday of Kronia, which was celebrated during the Attic month of Hekatombaion in late midsummer. It held theological importance for some Romans, who saw it as a restoration of the ancient Golden Age, when the world was ruled by Saturn. The Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry interpreted the freedom associated with Saturnalia as symbolizing the &quot;freeing of souls into immortality&quot;. Saturnalia may have influenced some of the customs associated with later celebrations in western Europe occurring in midwinter, particularly traditions associated with Christmas, the Feast of the Holy Innocents, and Epiphany. In particular, the historical western European Christmas custom of electing a &quot;Lord of Misrule&quot; may have its roots in Saturnalia celebrations.
==Origins==

In Roman mythology, Saturn was an agricultural deity who was said to have reigned over the world in the Golden Age, when humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in a state of innocence. The revelries of Saturnalia were supposed to reflect the conditions of the lost mythical age. The Greek equivalent was the Kronia, which was celebrated on the twelfth day of the month of Hekatombaion, which occurred from around mid-July to mid-August on the Attic calendar.

The Greek writer Athenaeus cites numerous other examples of similar festivals celebrated throughout the Greco-Roman world, including the Cretan festival of Hermaia in honor of Hermes, an unnamed festival from Troezen in honor of Poseidon, the Thessalian festival of Peloria in honor of Zeus Pelorios, and an unnamed festival from Babylon. He also mentions that the custom of masters dining with their slaves was associated with the Athenian festival of Anthesteria and the Spartan festival of Hyacinthia. The Argive festival of Hybristica, though not directly related to the Saturnalia, involved a similar reversal of roles in which women would dress as men and men would dress as women.

The ancient Roman historian Justinus credits Saturn with being a historical king of the pre-Roman inhabitants of Italy:


Although probably the best-known Roman holiday, Saturnalia as a whole is not described from beginning to end in any single ancient source. Modern understanding of the festival is pieced together from several accounts dealing with various aspects. The Saturnalia was the dramatic setting of the multivolume work of that name by Macrobius, a Latin writer from late antiquity who is the major source for information about the holiday. Macrobius describes the reign of Justinus&#x27;s &quot;king Saturn&quot; as &quot;a time of great happiness, both on account of the universal plenty that prevailed and because as yet there was no division into bond and free – as one may gather from the complete license enjoyed by slaves at the Saturnalia.&quot; In Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Saturnalia&quot; it is Chronos himself who proclaims a &quot;festive season, when &#x27;tis lawful to be drunken, and slaves have license to revile their lords&quot;.

In one of the interpretations in Macrobius&#x27;s work, Saturnalia is a festival of light leading to the winter solstice, with the abundant presence of candles symbolizing the quest for knowledge and truth. The renewal of light and the coming of the new year was celebrated in the later Roman Empire at the &quot;Dies Natalis Solis Invicti&quot;, the &quot;Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun&quot;, on 25 December.

The popularity of Saturnalia continued into the 3rd and 4th centuries CE, and as the Roman Empire came under Christian rule, many of its customs were recast into or at least influenced the seasonal celebrations surrounding Christmas and the New Year.

==Historical context==
Saturnalia underwent a major reform in 217 BC, after the Battle of Lake Trasimene, when the Romans suffered one of their most crushing defeats by Carthage during the Second Punic War. Until that time, they had celebrated the holiday according to Roman custom &quot;(more Romano)&quot;. It was after a consultation of the Sibylline Books that they adopted &quot;Greek rite&quot;, introducing sacrifices carried out in the Greek manner, the public banquet, and the continual shouts of &quot;io Saturnalia&quot; that became characteristic of the celebration. Cato the Elder (234–149 BC) remembered a time before the so-called &quot;Greek&quot; elements had been added to the Roman Saturnalia.

It was not unusual for the Romans to offer cult &quot;(cultus)&quot; to the deities of other nations in the hope of redirecting their favour (see &quot;evocatio&quot;), and the Second Punic War in particular created pressures on Roman society that led to a number of religious innovations and reforms. Robert E.A. Palmer has argued that the introduction of new rites at this time was in part an effort to appease Ba&#x27;al Hammon, the Carthaginian god who was regarded as the counterpart of the Roman Saturn and Greek Cronus. The table service that masters offered their slaves thus would have extended to Carthaginian or African war captives.

==Public religious observance==

===Rite at the temple of Saturn===
The statue of Saturn at his main temple normally had its feet bound in wool, which was removed for the holiday as an act of liberation. The official rituals were carried out according to &quot;Greek rite&quot; &quot;(ritus graecus)&quot;. The sacrifice was officiated by a priest, whose head was uncovered; in Roman rite, priests sacrificed &quot;capite velato&quot;, with head covered by a special fold of the toga. This procedure is usually explained by Saturn&#x27;s assimilation with his Greek counterpart Cronus, since the Romans often adopted and reinterpreted Greek myths, iconography, and even religious practices for their own deities, but the uncovering of the priest&#x27;s head may also be one of the Saturnalian reversals, the opposite of what was normal.

Following the sacrifice the Roman Senate arranged a &quot;lectisternium&quot;, a ritual of Greek origin that typically involved placing a deity&#x27;s image on a sumptuous couch, as if he were present and actively participating in the festivities. A public banquet followed &quot;(convivium publicum)&quot;.

The day was supposed to be a holiday from all forms of work. Schools were closed, and exercise regimens were suspended. Courts were not in session, so no justice was administered, and no declaration of war could be made. After the public rituals, observances continued at home. On 18 and 19 December, which were also holidays from public business, families conducted domestic rituals. They bathed early, and those with means sacrificed a suckling pig, a traditional offering to an earth deity.

===Human offerings===

Saturn also had a less benevolent aspect. One of his consorts was Lua, sometimes called &quot;Lua Saturni&quot; (&quot;Saturn&#x27;s Lua&quot;) and identified with Lua Mater, &quot;Mother Destruction&quot;, a goddess in whose honor the weapons of enemies killed in war were burned, perhaps in expiation. Saturn&#x27;s chthonic nature connected him to the underworld and its ruler Dīs Pater, the Roman equivalent of Greek Plouton (Pluto in Latin) who was also a god of hidden wealth. In sources of the third century AD and later, Saturn is recorded as receiving dead gladiators as offerings (&quot;munera&quot;) during or near the Saturnalia. These gladiatorial events, ten days in all throughout December, were presented mainly by the quaestors and sponsored with funds from the treasury of Saturn.

The practice of gladiator &quot;munera&quot; was criticized by Christian apologists as a form of human sacrifice. Although there is no evidence of this practice during the Republic, the offering of gladiators led to later theories that the primeval Saturn had demanded human victims. Macrobius says that Dīs Pater was placated with human heads and Saturn with sacrificial victims consisting of men (&quot;virorum victimis&quot;). In mythic lore, during the visit of Hercules to Italy, the civilizing demigod insisted that the practice be halted and the ritual reinterpreted. Instead of heads to Dīs Pater, the Romans were to offer effigies or masks &quot;(oscilla)&quot;; a mask appears in the representation of Saturnalia in the Calendar of Filocalus. Since the Greek word &quot;phota&quot; meant both &#x27;man&#x27; and &#x27;lights&#x27;, candles were a substitute offering to Saturn for the light of life. The figurines that were exchanged as gifts (&quot;sigillaria&quot;) may also have represented token substitutes.

==Private festivities==

===Role reversal===
Saturnalia was characterized by role reversals and behavioral license. Slaves were treated to a banquet of the kind usually enjoyed by their masters. Ancient sources differ on the circumstances: some suggest that master and slave dined together, while others indicate that the slaves feasted first, or that the masters actually served the food. The practice might have varied over time.

Saturnalian license also permitted slaves to disrespect their masters without the threat of a punishment. It was a time for free speech: the Augustan poet Horace calls it &quot;December liberty&quot;. In two satires set during the Saturnalia, Horace has a slave offer sharp criticism to his master. Everyone knew, however, that the leveling of the social hierarchy was temporary and had limits; no social norms were ultimately threatened, because the holiday would end.

The toga, the characteristic garment of the male Roman citizen, was set aside in favor of the Greek &quot;synthesis&quot;, colourful &quot;dinner clothes&quot; otherwise considered in poor taste for daytime wear. Romans of citizen status normally went about bare-headed, but for the Saturnalia donned the &quot;pilleus&quot;, the conical felt cap that was the usual mark of a freedman. Slaves, who ordinarily were not entitled to wear the &quot;pilleus&quot;, wore it as well, so that everyone was &quot;pilleated&quot; without distinction.

The participation of freeborn Roman women is implied by sources that name gifts for women, but their presence at banquets may have depended on the custom of their time; from the late Republic onward, women mingled socially with men more freely than they had in earlier times. Female entertainers were certainly present at some otherwise all-male gatherings. Role-playing was implicit in the Saturnalia&#x27;s status reversals, and there are hints of mask-wearing or &quot;guising&quot;. No theatrical events are mentioned in connection with the festivities, but the classicist Erich Segal saw Roman comedy, with its cast of impudent, free-wheeling slaves and libertine seniors, as imbued with the Saturnalian spirit.

===Gambling===

Gambling and dice-playing, normally prohibited or at least frowned upon, were permitted for all, even slaves. Coins and nuts were the stakes. On the Calendar of Philocalus, the Saturnalia is represented by a man wearing a fur-trimmed coat next to a table with dice, and a caption reading: &quot;Now you have license, slave, to game with your master.&quot; Rampant overeating and drunkenness became the rule, and a sober person the exception.

Seneca looked forward to the holiday, if somewhat tentatively, in a letter to a friend:

&quot;It is now the month of December, when the greatest part of the city is in a bustle. Loose reins are given to public dissipation; everywhere you may hear the sound of great preparations, as if there were some real difference between the days devoted to Saturn and those for transacting business. ... Were you here, I would willingly confer with you as to the plan of our conduct; whether we should eve in our usual way, or, to avoid singularity, both take a better supper and throw off the toga.&quot;

Some Romans found it all a bit much. Pliny describes a secluded suite of rooms in his Laurentine villa, which he used as a retreat: &quot;... especially during the Saturnalia when the rest of the house is noisy with the licence of the holiday and festive cries. This way I don&#x27;t hamper the games of my people and they don&#x27;t hinder my work or studies.&quot;

===Gift-giving===

The Sigillaria on 19 December was a day of gift-giving. Because gifts of value would mark social status contrary to the spirit of the season, these were often the pottery or wax figurines called &quot;sigillaria&quot; made specially for the day, candles, or &quot;gag gifts&quot;, of which Augustus was particularly fond. Children received toys as gifts. In his many poems about the Saturnalia, Martial names both expensive and quite cheap gifts, including writing tablets, dice, knucklebones, moneyboxes, combs, toothpicks, a hat, a hunting knife, an axe, various lamps, balls, perfumes, pipes, a pig, a sausage, a parrot, tables, cups, spoons, items of clothing, statues, masks, books, and pets. Gifts might be as costly as a slave or exotic animal, but Martial suggests that token gifts of low intrinsic value inversely measure the high quality of a friendship. Patrons or &quot;bosses&quot; might pass along a gratuity &quot;(sigillaricium)&quot; to their poorer clients or dependents to help them buy gifts. Some emperors were noted for their devoted observance of the Sigillaria.

In a practice that might be compared to modern greeting cards, verses sometimes accompanied the gifts. Martial has a collection of poems written as if to be attached to gifts. Catullus received a book of bad poems by &quot;the worst poet of all time&quot; as a joke from a friend.

Gift-giving was not confined to the day of the Sigillaria. In some households, guests and family members received gifts after the feast in which slaves had shared.

===King of the Saturnalia===

Imperial sources refer to a &quot;Saturnalicius princeps&quot; (&quot;Ruler of the Saturnalia&quot;), who ruled as master of ceremonies for the proceedings. He was appointed by lot, and has been compared to the medieval Lord of Misrule at the Feast of Fools. His capricious commands, such as &quot;Sing naked!&quot; or &quot;Throw him into cold water!&quot;, had to be obeyed by the other guests at the &quot;convivium&quot;: he creates and (mis)rules a chaotic and absurd world. The future emperor Nero is recorded as playing the role in his youth.

Since this figure does not appear in accounts from the Republican period, the &quot;princeps&quot; of the Saturnalia may have developed as a satiric response to the new era of rule by a &quot;princeps&quot;, the title assumed by the first emperor Augustus to avoid the hated connotations of the word &quot;king&quot; &quot;(rex)&quot;. Art and literature under Augustus celebrated his reign as a new Golden Age, but the Saturnalia makes a mockery of a world in which law is determined by one man and the traditional social and political networks are reduced to the power of the emperor over his subjects. In a poem about a lavish Saturnalia under Domitian, Statius makes it clear that the emperor, like Jupiter, still reigns during the temporary return of Saturn.

===&quot;Io Saturnalia&quot;===
The phrase &quot;io Saturnalia&quot; was the characteristic shout or salutation of the festival, originally commencing after the public banquet on the single day of 17 December. The interjection &quot;io&quot; (Greek &quot;ἰώ&quot;, &quot;ǐō&quot;) is pronounced either with two syllables (a short &quot;i&quot; and a long &quot;o&quot;) or as a single syllable (with the &quot;i&quot; becoming the Latin consonantal &quot;j&quot; and pronounced &quot;yō&quot;). It was a strongly emotive ritual exclamation or invocation, used for instance in announcing triumph or celebrating Bacchus, but also to punctuate a joke.

==On the calendar==
As an observance of state religion, Saturnalia was supposed to have been held &quot;... quarto decimo Kalendarum Ianuariarum&quot;, on the fourteenth day before the Kalends of the pre-Julian, twenty-nine day December, on the oldest Roman religious calendar, which the Romans believed to have been established by the legendary founder Romulus and his successor Numa Pompilius. It was a &quot;dies festus&quot;, a legal holiday when no public business could be conducted. The day marked the dedication anniversary &quot;(dies natalis)&quot; of the Temple to Saturn in the Roman Forum in 497 BC. When Julius Caesar had the calendar reformed because it had fallen out of synchronization with the solar year, two days were added to the month, and the date of Saturnalia then changed, still falling on the 17 December, but with this now being the sixteenth day before the Kalends, as per the Roman reckoning of dates of this time. It was felt, thus, that the original day had thus been moved by two days, and so Saturnalia was celebrated under Augustus as a three-day official holiday encompassing both dates.

By the late Republic, the private festivities of Saturnalia had expanded to seven days, but during the Imperial period contracted variously to three to five days. Caligula extended official observances to five.

The date 17 December was the first day of the astrological sign Capricorn, the house of Saturn, the planet named for the god. Its proximity to the winter solstice (21 to 23 December on the Julian calendar) was endowed with various meanings by both ancient and modern scholars: for instance, the widespread use of wax candles &quot;(cerei,&quot; singular &quot;cereus)&quot; could refer to &quot;the returning power of the sun&#x27;s light after the solstice&quot;.

==Ancient theological and philosophical views==

===Roman===
The Saturnalia reflects the contradictory nature of the deity Saturn himself: &quot;There are joyful and utopian aspects of careless well-being side by side with disquieting elements of threat and danger.&quot;

As a deity of agricultural bounty, Saturn embodied prosperity and wealth in general. The name of his consort Ops meant &quot;wealth, resources&quot;. Her festival, Opalia, was celebrated on 19 December. The Temple of Saturn housed the state treasury (&quot;aerarium Saturni&quot;) and was the administrative headquarters of the quaestors, the public officials whose duties included oversight of the mint. It was among the oldest cult sites in Rome, and had been the location of &quot;a very ancient&quot; altar &quot;(ara)&quot; even before the building of the first temple in 497 BC.

The Romans regarded Saturn as the original and autochthonous ruler of the Capitolium, and the first king of Latium or even the whole of Italy. At the same time, there was a tradition that Saturn had been an immigrant deity, received by Janus after he was usurped by his son Jupiter (Zeus) and expelled from Greece. His contradictions—a foreigner with one of Rome&#x27;s oldest sanctuaries, and a god of liberation who is kept in fetters most of the year—indicate Saturn&#x27;s capacity for obliterating social distinctions.

Roman mythology of the Golden Age of Saturn&#x27;s reign differed from the Greek tradition. He arrived in Italy &quot;dethroned and fugitive&quot;, but brought agriculture and civilization and became a king. As the Augustan poet Virgil described it: &quot;[H]e gathered together the unruly race [of fauns and nymphs] scattered over mountain heights, and gave them laws ... Under his reign were the golden ages men tell of: in such perfect peace he ruled the nations.&quot;
The third century Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry took an allegorical view of the Saturnalia. He saw the festival&#x27;s theme of liberation and dissolution as representing the &quot;freeing of souls into immortality&quot;—an interpretation that Mithraists may also have followed, since they included many slaves and freedmen. According to Porphyry, the Saturnalia occurred near the winter solstice because the sun enters Capricorn, the astrological house of Saturn, at that time. In the Saturnalia of Macrobius, the proximity of the Saturnalia to the winter solstice leads to an exposition of solar monotheism, the belief that the Sun (see Sol Invictus) ultimately encompasses all divinities as one.

===Jewish===
M. Avodah Zarah lists Saturnalia as a &quot;festival of the gentiles,&quot; along with the Calends of January and Kratesis. B. Avodah Zarah records that Ḥanan b. Rava said, &quot;Kalends is held during the eight days after the [winter] solstice and Saturnura begins eight days before the [winter] solstice&quot;. Ḥananel b. Ḥushiel, followed by Rashi, claims: &quot;Eight days before the solstice -- their festival was for all eight days,&quot; which slightly overstates the Saturnalia&#x27;s historical six-day length, possibly to associate the holiday with Hanukkah.

In the Jerusalem Talmud, &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; claims the etymology of Saturnalia is שנאה טמונה &quot;śinʾâ ṭǝmûnâ&quot; &quot;hidden hatred,&quot; and refers to the hatred Esau, whom the Rabbis believed had fathered Rome, harbored for Jacob.

The Babylonian Talmud&#x27;s &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; ascribes the origins of Saturnalia (and Kalends) to Adam, who saw that the days were getting shorter and thought it was punishment for his sin:
In the Babylonian &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot;, this etiology is attributed to the tannaim, but the story is suspiciously similar to the etiology of Kalends attributed by the Jerusalem Avodah Zarah to Abba Arikha.

==Influence==
Unlike several Roman religious festivals which were particular to cult sites in the city, the prolonged seasonal celebration of Saturnalia at home could be held anywhere in the Empire. Saturnalia continued as a secular celebration long after it was removed from the official calendar. As William Warde Fowler notes: &quot;[Saturnalia] has left its traces and found its parallels in great numbers of medieval and modern customs, occurring about the time of the winter solstice.&quot;

The date of Jesus&#x27;s birth is unknown. A spurious correspondence between Cyril of Jerusalem and Pope Julius I (337–352), quoted by John of Nikiu in the 9th century, is sometimes given as a source for a claim that, in the fourth century AD, Pope Julius I decreed that the birth of Jesus be celebrated on 25 December. Some speculate that the date was chosen to create a Christian replacement or alternative to Saturnalia and the birthday festival of Sol Invictus, held on 25 December. Around AD 200, Tertullian had berated Christians for continuing to celebrate the pagan Saturnalia festival. The Church may have hoped to attract more converts to Christianity by allowing them to continue to celebrate on the same day. The Church may have also been influenced by the idea that Jesus was conceived and died on the same date; Jesus died during Passover and, in the third century AD, Passover was celebrated on 25 March. The Church may have calculated Jesus&#x27;s birthday as nine months later, on 25 December. But in fact the correspondence is spurious.

As a result of the close proximity of dates, many Christians in western Europe continued to celebrate traditional Saturnalia customs in association with Christmas and the surrounding holidays. Like Saturnalia, Christmas during the Middle Ages was a time of ruckus, drinking, gambling, and overeating. The tradition of the &quot;Saturnalicius princeps&quot; was particularly influential. In medieval France and Switzerland, a boy would be elected &quot;bishop for a day&quot; on 28 December (the Feast of the Holy Innocents) and would issue decrees much like the &quot;Saturnalicius princeps&quot;. The boy bishop&#x27;s tenure ended during the evening vespers. This custom was common across western Europe, but varied considerably by region; in some places, the boy bishop&#x27;s orders could become quite rowdy and unrestrained, but, in others, his power was only ceremonial. In some parts of France, during the boy bishop&#x27;s tenure, the actual clergy would wear masks or dress in women&#x27;s clothing, a reversal of roles in line with the traditional character of Saturnalia.

During the late medieval period and early Renaissance, many towns in England elected a &quot;Lord of Misrule&quot; at Christmas time to preside over the Feast of Fools. This custom was sometimes associated with the Twelfth Night or Epiphany. A common tradition in western Europe was to drop a bean, coin, or other small token into a cake or pudding; whoever found the object would become the &quot;King (or Queen) of the Bean&quot;. During the Protestant Reformation, reformers sought to revise or even completely abolish such practices, which they regarded as &quot;popish&quot;; these efforts were largely successful. The Puritans banned the &quot;Lord of Misrule&quot; in England and the custom was largely forgotten shortly thereafter, though the bean in the pudding survived as a tradition of a small gift to the one finding a single almond hidden in the traditional Christmas porridge in Scandinavia.

Nonetheless, in the middle of the nineteenth century, some of the old ceremonies, such as gift-giving, were revived in English-speaking countries as part of a widespread &quot;Christmas revival&quot;. During this revival, authors such as Charles Dickens sought to reform the &quot;conscience of Christmas&quot; and turn the formerly riotous holiday into a family-friendly occasion. Vestiges of the Saturnalia festivities may still be preserved in some of the traditions now associated with Christmas. The custom of gift-giving at Christmas time resembles the Roman tradition of giving &quot;sigillaria&quot; and the lighting of Advent candles resembles the Roman tradition of lighting torches and wax tapers. Likewise, Saturnalia and Christmas both share associations with eating, drinking, singing, and dancing.

<text>FlightGear Flight Simulator (often shortened to FlightGear or FGFS) is a free, open source multi-platform flight simulator developed by the project since 1997.

David Murr started this project on April 8, 1996. This project had its first release in 1997 and continued in development. It has specific builds for a variety of different operating systems including Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, IRIX, and Solaris.

&quot;FlightGear&quot; is an atmospheric and orbital flight simulator used in aerospace research and industry. Its flight dynamics engine (&quot;JSBSim&quot;) is used in a 2015 NASA benchmark to judge new simulation code to the standards of the space industry.

== History ==
&quot;FlightGear&quot; started as an online proposal in 1996 by David Murr, living in the United States. He was dissatisfied with proprietary, available, simulators like the Microsoft Flight Simulator, citing motivations of companies not aligning with the simulators&#x27; players (&quot;simmers&quot;), and proposed a new flight simulator developed by volunteers over the Internet. The flight simulator was created using custom 3D graphics code. Development of an OpenGL based version was spearheaded by Curtis Olson starting in 1997. &quot;FlightGear&quot; incorporated other open-source resources, including the LaRCsim flight dynamics engine from NASA, and freely available elevation data. The first working binaries using OpenGL came out in 1997. By 1999 FlightGear had replaced LaRCsim with &quot;JSBSim&quot; built to the sims&#x27; needs, and in 2015 NASA used &quot;JSBSim&quot; alongside 6 other space industry standards to create a measuring stick to judge future space industry simulation code.

&quot;FlightGear&quot; reached 1.0 in 2007, 2.0 in 2010, and there were 9 major releases under 2.x and 3.x labels, with the final one under the previous numbering scheme being &quot;3.4&quot;, since &quot;3.6&quot; was cancelled. The project moved to a regular release cadence with 2-4 releases per year since 2016, with the first version under the new naming scheme being &quot;2016.1&quot;. Around that time, the graphical front end &quot;FlightGear Launch Control&quot;, also known as &quot;FGRun&quot;, was replaced by a hard-coded Qt launcher. &quot;FlightGear&#x27;s&quot; source code is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License and is free and open-source software.

The &quot;FlightGear&quot; project has been nominated by SourceForge, and subsequently chosen as project of the month by the community, in 2015, 2017, and 2019.

==Simulator features==

=== Physics ===
Forces experienced by a flying aircraft depend on the time-varying state of atmospheric fluid flow along the flight path - the atmosphere being a fluid that can exchange energy, exchange moisture or particles, change phase or other state, and exert force with boundaries formed by surfaces. Fluid behaviour is often characterised by eddies(Videos:aircraft, terrain) or vortices on varying scales down to the microscopic, but is harder to observe as the air is clear except for moisture phase changes like condensation trails or clouds. The atmosphere-terrain boundary interaction follows fluid dynamics, just with processes on hugely varying scales and &#x27;weather&#x27; is the planetary boundary layer. The aircraft surface interaction works with the same dynamics, but on a limited range of scales. Forces experienced at any point along a flight path, therefore, are the result of complicated atmospheric processes on varying spatial scales, and complex flow along the craft&#x27;s surface. Craft also experience varying gravitational force based on the 3d shape of the potential well and the non-spherical shape of the Earth.

==== Atmospheric &amp; Environmental Physics ====
&quot;FlightGear&quot; can simulate the atmosphere ranging from energy inputs/outputs to the system, like energy from the sun or volcanic sources, through to fluid flow on various scales and changes of state. &quot;FlightGear&quot; is able to model different surface characteristics such as heating or cooling, and the exchange of heat and moisture with the atmosphere depending on factors like windflow or dew point. &quot;FlightGear&quot; models the continuously evolving life-cycle of phenomena on various scales, driven by interaction of fluid with terrain. They range from turbulence on different scales to, individual thermals, thunderstorms, through to moving air layers, and depicting air-masses on the scale of thousands of kilometers. Atmospheric water is modeled by &quot;FlightGear&quot; ranging from state changes such as condensing into cloud or haze layers, along with energy provided from latent heat to drive convective fluid flow, through to precipitation as rain droplets, snow, or hail.

The process of generating lift creates turbulence with vortices, and &quot;FlightGear&quot; models wake turbulence with shedding of wingtip vortices by flown craft as well as AI craft.

FlightGear also has a less physically accurate model that uses METAR weather updates of differing frequency, designed for safe operation of aerodromes, to dis-continuously force atmosphere based on attempted guesses of processes that are fundamentally constrained by the closeness or density of observation stations, as well as the small-scale, limited, rounded off, non-smoothly varying, and need-to-know precision of information. Aloft waypoint settings modelling high altitude behaviors of wind can be synced to updates from Jeppeson.

&quot;Flightgear&quot; has a simulation of planetary bodies in the solar system which is used for purposes like driving latitude dependent weather from solar radiation, as well as the brightness and position of stars for celestial navigation. There is a model of gravity based on a non-spherical Earth, and craft can even experience differing gravity across their bodies which will exert twisting force. A model of the observed variation in the Earth&#x27;s complex magnetic field, and the option to simulate, to an extent, the propagation of radio wave signals due to interaction with different types of terrain, also exists in &quot;FlightGear&quot;.

&quot;FlightGear&quot; uses an exact, non-spherical, model of Earth, and is also able to simulate flight in polar regions and airports (arctic or antarctic) without simulator errors due to issues with coordinate systems.

==== Flight Dynamics ====
&quot;FlightGear&quot; supports multiple flight dynamics engines with differing approaches, and external sources such as MATLAB/Simulink, as well as custom flight models for hot air balloons and spacecraft.

&quot;JSBSim&quot; is a data driven flight dynamics engine with a C++ core built to the needs of the FlightGear project from 1996 to replace NASA&#x27;s &quot;LaRCSim&quot;, and integrated into &quot;FlightGear&quot; as the default from 1999. Flight characteristics are preserved despite low frame rate, as JSBSim physics are decoupled from rendering and tick at 120 Hz by default. This also supports high time-acceleration as rendering does not have to be done faster causing the GPU to be a bottleneck.

Mass balance, ground reactions, propulsion, aerodynamics, buoyant forces, external forces, atmospheric forces, and gravitational forces can be utilized by &quot;JSBSim&quot;, the current default flight dynamics engine supported by &quot;FlightGear&quot;, to determine flight characteristics. &quot;JSBSim&quot; supports non-terrestrial atmospheres and has been used to model unmanned flight in the Martian atmosphere by NASA.

====== Benchmark testing by NASA ======
JSBSim was used by NASA in 2015 with other space industry simulation code, both to establish a ruler to judge future code for the requirements and standards of the space industry, as well as check agreement. The verification tested both atmospheric and orbital flight in 6-degrees-of-freedom for simulations like JSBSim that supported both. The results from 6 participants consisting of NASA Ames Research Center (VMSRTE), Armstrong Flight Research Center (Core), Johnson Space Center (JEOD), Langley Research Center (LaSRS++, POST-II), Marshall Space Flight Center (MAVERIC), and JSBSim were anonymous as NASA wanted to encourage participation. However, the assessment found agreement for all test cases between the majority of participants, with the differences being explainable and reducible for the rest, and with the orbital tests agreeing &quot;quite well&quot; for all participants.

===== YASim =====
YASim&#x27;s approach to flight dynamics uses the geometry of the aircraft present in the 3D model at startup, conceptually similar to Blade element theory used by some software, to calculate a rough approximation of fluid dynamics - with the conceptual problems that each &quot;element&quot; is considered in isolation therefore missing affecting fluid flow to other elements, and the approximation breaking down for craft in transonic to hypersonic regimes. By contrast, offline approaches like JSBSim can incorporate windtunnel data. They can also incorporate the results of computational fluid dynamics which can reach computable accuracy only limited by the nature of the problem and present day computational resources.

&quot;FlightGear&quot; also supports LaRCsim and UIUC.

==== Time acceleration ====
&quot;FlightGear&quot; is able to accelerate and decelerate time, speeding up or slowing down the simulation. Time acceleration is a critical feature for simulating longer flights and space missions. For all interactions with the simulator, it allows people to speed up uneventful parts, and gain more experience (decisions and problem solving). It also means automated simulations used for research finish faster - this is helped by &quot;FlightGear&#x27;s&quot; headless mode.

&quot;FlightGear&quot; is able to support high time accelerations by allowing parts of the simulation to run at different rates. This allows saving of CPU and GPU resources by letting unimportant parts of the simulation, like visuals or less time-sensitive aircraft systems, run at slower rates. It also improves performance. Separate clocks are available for JSBSim physics, different parts of aircraft systems, as well as environment simulations at large scale (celestial simulation) and small scale (weather physics).

=== Rendering and visual cues ===

==== Atmosphere rendering ====
&quot;Flightgear&#x27;s&quot; atmospheric rendering is able to provide constantly changing visual cues of processes affecting atmospheric fluid flow and their likely evolution and history - to make prediction of conditions ahead or when returning at a later time possible. Simulation of directional light scattering by the Advanced Light Scattering framework in the atmosphere shows the 3d distribution, layering, geometry, and even statistical orientation of particles in different scattering regimes like Mie or Rayleigh. This ranges from different moisture droplets, to smog, to ice crystals of different geometry in clouds or halos.

===== Cloud rendering =====
The 3d density distribution of cloud (or condensation trail) moisture rendered by &quot;FlightGear&quot; acts as a cue to the corresponding 3d structure of fluid flow, such as the up and down draft loop of storm cell, internal gravity waves forming undulating cloud bands signalling a sweeping cold front, or windshear shaping cirrus clouds at higher altitude.

===== Precipitation and accumulation rendering =====
&quot;FlightGear&quot; is able to render rain falling from specific clouds in rain volumes containing the correct droplet size to determine the properties like thickness and intensity of rainbows. Perceptual phenomena like rain streaks are rendered with streak length shortening as time is slowed. Rain and water spray streaks on canopy glass provides cues to the relative air flow, while frost and fog with correct light scattering provide cues to temperature.

&quot;FlightGear&quot; is able to render specified historical accumulation levels of water and snow accounting for flatness on the surfaces of for both terrain and buildings. This provides cues to surface moisture or friction, and weather driven by surface heating that reduces with snow thickness. &quot;FlightGear&quot; can render gradual snow and ice cover on inland and ocean water.

===== Hazes and Halos =====
Layering of hazes is rendered by &quot;FlightGear&quot;, such as low lying ground haze with 3d structure, smog related to human activity, and dust. &quot;FlightGear&quot; renders various halos due to ice crystals in the atmosphere, or due to Mie scattering in fog by artificial lights such as landing lights.

===== Orbital rendering =====
&quot;FlightGear&quot; is able to render day/night visuals of Earth from orbit at high detail with scattering due to clouds, dust, and moisture, as well as effects such as lightning illuminating storm cells. Orientation cues in cockpit are provided by changing colour of light from Sun, Earth, and Moon for craft such as the Space Shuttle. The gradual transition in lighting for spacecraft, between upper and lower atmosphere regimes, is handled by dedicated rendering code. Auroras are simulated with varying intensity and varying penetration of magnetic flux tubes into the atmosphere. They are visible from both space and ground.

Accurate rendering of planets, moons, and stars with correct phases/brightness based on &quot;FlightGear&quot;&#x27;s celestial simulation allows cues or data for celestial navigation - without reliance on vulnerable ground aids, including of pre-GPS era craft. The celestial simulation allows craft such as the Space Shuttle to use star tracker instruments.

===== Environment rendering =====
&quot;Flightgear&quot;&#x27;s Advanced Light Scattering framework simulates locations in time as well as space. The environment simulation renders seasonal change as leaves of different species of trees, bushes, and grass change colour or fall. Simulated swaying of grass, trees and windsocks provide cues to processes changing the windfield near the ground, while wave simulation provides cues near water. Cloud shadows and the general state of the atmosphere affect light traveling to each point of the environment and then traveling in the atmosphere to reach the eye - the cloud setup and particle spread in the atmosphere changes the colour of the light cast on the environment. Water colour therefore changes based on atmosphere overhead, and also depends on water impurites in a region. &quot;FlightGear&quot; is capable of rendering a variety of volcanic activity of different intensity that, from v2019.2, responds to the windfield, as well as smoke.

The combination of rendering of the state of atmospheric processes, Aurora, simulation of celestial bodies, ground accumulation of rain or snow or dust, ice cover of water, and the environment simulation produces visualisations with a vast number of permutations.

===Multiplayer===
Several networking options allow to communicate with other instances of . A multiplayer protocol is available for using on a local network in a multi aircraft environment. This can be used for formation flight or air traffic control simulation. Soon after the original Multiplayer Protocol became available, it was expanded to allow playing over the internet. It is possible to see other players in the simulator if they have the same aircraft models and viewing their flight path is possible with the simulator&#x27;s online multiplayer map.

Since version 2020.1 it is possible to connect to VATSIM by using the open-source swift pilot client.

Several instances of can be synchronized to allow for a multi-monitor environment.

=== Weather ===

 uses metar data to produce live weather patterns in real time. Detailed weather settings allow for 3d clouds, a variety of cloud types, and precipitation. Precipitation and terrain affect turbulence and cloud formations. Aloft waypoint settings allow high altitude behaviors of wind to be modeled from live weather information, and thermals can also be modeled.

==Critical reception==
Although not developed or typically analyzed solely as a game in the traditional sense, has nevertheless undergone reviews in a number of online and offline publications, and received positive reviews as a flight simulator game. 1.0.0 was noted as being impressive for a game over a decade in the making, with a wide variety of aircraft and features.

&quot;PC Magazine&quot; noted how it is designed to be easy to add new aircraft and scenery. Linux Format reviewed version 2.0 and rated it 8/10.

==Controversy==
In June 2014 Honda lawyers issued a takedown request in which it was claimed that the HondaJet model in the simulator infringes on Honda&#x27;s trademarks. Subsequently, HondaJet became the first model removed from the simulator for legal reasons.

Games journalist Tim Stone, in his simulation column The Flare Path, criticized the practice of third-parties attempting to profit from the work of community volunteers to the project, pointing to deceptive practices of stealing media available online from other sims to misrepresent VirtualPilot3d, as well as highlighting allegedly fake customer testimonials. Following up in 2018, Tim Stone wrote a second column in which he again criticized the &quot;ethical standards&quot; and &quot;extraordinary willingness to lie in the pursuit of sales&quot; displayed by the advertisements for another game which used screenshots from FlightGear.

==Applications and usages==

<text>Descendents is an American punk rock band formed in Manhattan Beach, California, in 1977, by guitarist Frank Navetta, bassist Tony Lombardo and drummer Bill Stevenson as a power pop/surf punk band. In 1979, they enlisted Stevenson&#x27;s school friend Milo Aukerman as a singer, and reappeared as a melodic hardcore punk band, becoming a major player in the hardcore scene developing in Los Angeles at the time. They have released eight studio albums, three live albums, three compilation albums, and four EPs. Since 1986, the band&#x27;s lineup has consisted of Aukerman, Stevenson, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and bassist Karl Alvarez.

==History==
===Early years, &quot;Fat EP&quot;, &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot;, and first hiatus (1977–1984)===
In 1977, friends Frank Navetta and David Nolte began writing songs on acoustic guitars with the intention of forming a band. They initially called themselves &quot;The Itch&quot;, until Navetta came up with the name &quot;Descendents&quot;. By the end of the year they had failed to attract any more band members, so Nolte left to join the Last with his brothers. In late 1978 Navetta, joined by drummer Bill Stevenson, and with Nolte switching from guitar to bass, revitalized the Descendents project. Nolte sang with the group at several of their early performances alongside Navetta, but by the spring of 1979, The Last were becoming more active and he left the Descendents again, being replaced by bassist Tony Lombardo. The lineup of Navetta, Lombardo, and Stevenson recorded the band&#x27;s debut single at Media Art studios and released it on their own label, Orca Records, named after Stevenson&#x27;s fishing boat. Navetta sang &quot;Ride the Wild&quot; while Lombardo sang &quot;It&#x27;s a Hectic World&quot;. Nolte produced and mixed the session, and his brother Joe turned the lead guitar level up, resulting in the guitar being very loud in the mix.

The band&#x27;s music at the time was described by Stevenson as a &quot;coffee&#x27;d-out blend of rock-surf-pop-punk music [...] The sound consisted basically of Lombardo&#x27;s hard-driving, melodic bass lines, Navetta&#x27;s tight guitar riffing, and my &#x27;caffinated&#x27; surf beats.&quot; Steven Blush, author of &quot;American Hardcore: A Tribal History&quot;, describes the single as &quot;a blend of Devo-style new wave and Dick Dale-like surf.&quot; Ned Raggett of AllMusic describes it as surf-inspired power pop with a New Wave edge: &quot;Not quite Devo if they grew up on the coast, but there&#x27;s something to that comparison.&quot;

After a six-month trial with a female singer, Cecilia Loera, they recruited Milo Aukerman as their new vocalist after Navetta and Lombardo got tired of singing. The addition of Aukerman led the band to write shorter, faster, and more aggressive songs in a hardcore punk style. They later released the Fat EP in 1982. It was a record which established the band&#x27;s presence in the southern California hardcore punk movement with its short, fast, aggressive songs.

For the recording of their debut album &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; in June 1982, the band worked at Total Access Recording in Redondo Beach, California, with Spot, who had also engineered and produced the &quot;Fat EP&quot;. While still short and fast, the songs on &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; were also melodic. Aukerman later reflected: &quot;It&#x27;s interesting: we started very melodic, then moved to hardcore, but melded the two at a certain point and became melodic hardcore.&quot; The album&#x27;s title and cover illustration referenced Aukerman&#x27;s departure from the band to study biology at the University of California, San Diego. The illustration was done by Jeff Atkinson, based on earlier caricatures by a high school classmate of Aukerman&#x27;s named Roger Deuerlein, who had drawn comic strips and posters depicting Aukerman as the class nerd.

A note on the back of the LP read &quot;In dedication to Milo Aukerman from the Descendents&quot;, and was signed by the other three members. Aukerman later recalled that the band took his departure in stride:
When I decided to go to university, the guys in the band were pretty hip on it because they knew how big of a nerd I was. Like, &quot;What else would you expect him to do but to go off and be a geek?&quot; I mean, I&#x27;ve got a Ph.D in biochemistry — how uncool is that?


The band continued performing for a time with Ray Cooper on vocals, who would switch to rhythm guitar, when Aukerman made return visits to Los Angeles. At the same time, Stevenson had also joined Black Flag, intending to be in both bands at once but soon finding it too difficult due to Black Flag&#x27;s touring and recording schedule.

With Aukerman in college and Stevenson in Black Flag, the Descendents went on hiatus from 1983 to 1985. During this time Navetta burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, while Cooper and Lombardo performed as the Ascendents.

===Reformation, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot;, &quot;Enjoy!&quot;, &quot;All&quot;, and second hiatus (1985–1995)===

In 1985 Stevenson left Black Flag and he, Aukerman, Cooper, and Lombardo reconvened as the Descendents for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot;, recorded that April at Music Lab studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, with producer and engineer David Tarling and published by New Alliance Records. 

After three tours in support of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot;, the band recorded &quot;Enjoy!&quot; in March and April 1986 at Radio Tokyo studios in Venice, California. Drummer Bill Stevenson acted as producer of the album, working with recording engineers Richard Andrews and Ethan James.

The lyrics of &quot;Hürtin&#x27; Crüe&quot; derived from a high school classmate of singer Milo Aukerman who had earned a score of 1420 on the SAT, gaining him entry into the United States Military Academy. Gloating about his accomplishment, he sang a taunt with the lyrics &quot;I am better than you / You are a piece of poo / 1420&quot;. Aukerman incorporated these lyrics into &quot;Hürtin&#x27; Crüe&quot;. The cover artwork for &quot;Enjoy!&quot; was drawn by guitarist Ray Cooper under the pseudonym &quot;Scoob Droolins&quot;. Rather than printing the song titles on the reverse of the album&#x27;s sleeve, the band instead replaced them with various euphemisms for feces.

The band supported &quot;Enjoy!&quot; with a tour through the Summer of 1986. Following the tour both Carrion and Cooper left the band, and were replaced by Karl Alvarez and Stephen Egerton, respectively, from the Utah band Massacre Guys. In 1987 New Alliance was sold to SST Records, who re-released &quot;Enjoy!&quot; on cassette and compact disc. The cassette and CD versions added two additional tracks: &quot;Orgofart&quot; and &quot;Orgo 51&quot;. &quot;Orgofart&quot; consists entirely of the band members cheering each other on as they fart into recording equipment, a technique also used in &quot;Enjoy&quot;, while &quot;Orgo 51&quot; is a heavy metal-influenced instrumental track.

One week later, on Stevenson&#x27;s birthday of September 10, Stephen Egerton and Karl Alvarez moved from Salt Lake City to fill the vacant guitar and bass positions. &quot;All&quot; was recorded in January 1987 at Radio Tokyo studios in Venice, California, with recording engineer Richard Andrews and was produced by Stevenson. Dez Cadena sang backing vocals, while Stevenson created the album&#x27;s cover graphics and Alvarez provided illustrations for the sleeve and liner notes.

The album was themed around the concept of &quot;All&quot;, which had been invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion during a fishing trip on Stevenson&#x27;s boat &quot;Orca&quot; in 1980. According to singer Milo Aukerman: &quot;While drinking all this coffee in the midst of catching mackerel they came up with the concept of All — doing the utmost, achieving the utmost. The more they got into it the more it turned into their own religion; it&#x27;s partly humor, but it&#x27;s also an outlook on how to conduct your life: to not settle for some, to always go for All.&quot; Stevenson described the concept of &quot;All&quot; as &quot;the total extent&quot;, and he and McCuistion had quickly written several short songs that would later be recorded by the Descendents, including &quot;All&quot; and &quot;No, All!&quot;, written &quot;in a fit of Allular frustration. The songs were only seconds long, but that was all the time we needed to make the point.&quot; McCuistion also shared writing credit on &quot;All-O-Gistics&quot;, a musical set of commandments for achieving All, including lyrics such as &quot;Thou shalt not commit adulthood&quot;, &quot;Thou shalt not partake of decaf&quot;, and &quot;Thou shalt not suppress flatulence&quot;. In a June 1987 interview with &quot;Music&quot; magazine, Stevenson elaborated on the &quot;All&quot; concept:
I&#x27;m really into &quot;ALL&quot;&#x27; and I&#x27;ve waited a long time to unleash the whole concept on people. And now I&#x27;m going to do it [...] It&#x27;s just a way of thinking, in which there are extremes and there is this goal called &#x27;ALL.&#x27; It&#x27;s a way that I created in dealing with achievement and satisfaction and how the two relate. Basically just to avoid stagnation... going for &quot;ALL&quot; and never being satisfied and just wallowing in your own sameness.


Aside from the concept of &quot;All&quot;, other songs on the album such as &quot;Coolidge&quot;, &quot;Pep Talk&quot;, and &quot;Clean Sheets&quot; dealt with themes of broken relationships, while &quot;Iceman&quot; was loosely based on the play &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; by Eugene O&#x27;Neill. The album was released through SST Records, who had purchased the Descendents&#x27; previous label New Alliance Records that year and also re-released all of their previous albums. &quot;All&quot; was released in LP, cassette, and CD formats, the latter two containing the additional tracks &quot;Jealous of the World&quot; and &quot;Uranus&quot;. The band supported the album with a 60-day Spring 1987 tour, followed by the 50-day Summer &quot;FinALL&quot; tour, so-called due to Aukerman&#x27;s decision to leave the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. Recordings from these tours were used for the live albums &quot;Liveage!&quot; (1987) and &quot;&quot; (1989). Following Aukerman&#x27;s departure the band added singer Dave Smalley of Dag Nasty and rechristened themselves All, a change Stevenson claimed he had wanted to make for eight years. &quot;Well, basically, I&#x27;ve been wanting to work with David for a long time; but at the same time, Milo has stuck with me for almost nine years now, so I wouldn&#x27;t exactly feel right about just continuing to call us the Descendents. In a sense that would be kind of like discrediting Milo&#x27;s nine years worth of effort. It&#x27;s kind of like, &#x27;Let the Descendents be my and Milo&#x27;s sacred thing,&#x27; or whatever. Who knows, at some point later on we might decide that we want to get together and record something.

On December 16, 1987, during the recording of the first All album &quot;Allroy Sez&quot;, Pat McCuistion died when his fishing boat sank during a storm. Stevenson remarked that &quot;He had 15,000 pounds of fish onboard, so I guess you could say he died in heated pursuit of All. He was always the &#x27;5th member&#x27; of the band, besides being my best friend, next to Milo.&quot;

===Second reformation, &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;, and third hiatus (1995–2003)===
In 1995 Aukerman expressed a desire to return to recording and performing, so the band members decided to work with him as the Descendents while continuing to work with Price as All, in order to &quot;make room for Milo without pushing Chad out.&quot; Stevenson explained that the arrangement did not cause any resentment between the two singers: &quot;[I]t&#x27;s all totally good, it&#x27;s just that when we are playing, Milo couldn&#x27;t be All&#x27;s singer, cause Chad is All&#x27;s singer. So, we decided that we could be Descendents with Milo, and All with Chad. It&#x27;s not really a reunion, we&#x27;ve been together the whole time.&quot; Aukerman described his decision to rejoin the band as &quot;really just my re-entry into the song writing, I had been away for so long and I just wanted to make music which is what I love to do.&quot;

&quot;Everything Sucks&quot; was recorded in June and July 1996 at The Blasting Room, a studio built and run by Stevenson in Fort Collins, Colorado. Original Descendents members Tony Lombardo and Frank Navetta made appearances on the album: Navetta wrote the song &quot;Doghouse&quot; and both he and Lombardo played on it, marking the first recording by the original Descendents lineup of Aukerman, Lombardo, Navetta, and Stevenson since &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; in 1982. Lombardo also played on &quot;Eunuch Boy&quot;, a song he and Aukerman had written fifteen years earlier. According to Aukerman: Eunuch Boy&#x27; is the first song I ever wrote, really. When we formed, Tony Lombardo, the original bass player said, &#x27;Dude- you need to write some songs,&#x27; and I had never written a song before so I just wrote down some words and brought it to him. He made the music for it.&quot; Lombardo also wrote and played on &quot;Gotta&quot;, which was left off of the album but released as a B-side on the &quot;When I Get Old&quot; single. Chad Price sang backing vocals on the album, while Stevenson and Egerton produced and engineered it.

All had previously been signed to major label Interscope Records for 1995&#x27;s &quot;Pummel&quot;, but were dissatisfied with the experience. Both All and the Descendents signed to Epitaph Records, who released &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;, the subsequent All albums &quot;Mass Nerder&quot; (1998) and &quot;Problematic&quot; (2000), and the All/Descendents double live album &quot;Live Plus One&quot; (2001). It was rumored that Epitaph would not sign All without getting the Descendents as well, but Stevenson explained that the arrangement was made because Epitaph head Brett Gurewitz would allow both bands to make albums at their discretion:
When we signed with Epitaph it was for both bands. It was a thing of knowing Brett forever, and so I just sat down and said, &quot;Well, we want to make records!&quot; At the time we were leaving Interscope. We weren&#x27;t happy with Interscope at all. So we sat down and told them we wanted to make both All and Descendents records whenever we want, at our choosing. Brett and I worked out a deal like that, so it was really flexible and we could basically do whatever we wanted.
The Descendents supported &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; with a series of tours from September 1996 to August 1997 covering the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe, touring with Swingin&#x27; Utters, the Bouncing Souls, the Suicide Machines, Shades Apart, Guttermouth, Less Than Jake, Handsome, Electric Frankenstein, Social Distortion, Pennywise, H2O, and others. Music videos were filmed for &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot; and &quot;When I Get Old&quot;, and both songs were released as singles in Europe.

=== Third reformation, &quot;Cool to Be You,&quot; reunions, &quot;Filmage&quot;, and &quot;Hypercaffium Spazzinate&quot; (2004–2017) ===

In the early 2000s, Aukerman took a break from biochemistry and reunited with the Descendents to record a new album. The recording sessions for &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; took place with Aukerman in February 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with additional recording done in April at Planet of Sound in Wilmington, Delaware, and were produced by Stevenson. The band recorded the music for the songs live in the studio with minimal overdubbing, and Aukerman&#x27;s vocals were recorded over the instrumental tracks. However, these recordings were not released for another two years. Stevenson explained that the gap of eight years between Descendents albums was due to the band members having children and to his father&#x27;s death.

For the release of &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; the Descendents signed to Fat Wreck Chords. Label head and musician Fat Mike was a longtime fan of the band, and his enthusiasm for working with them was a major factor in their decision to sign to the label. Stevenson commented that &quot;If you&#x27;ve got the owner of the label saying he wants to put out a record by what is probably his favorite band of all time, that&#x27;s rad. That&#x27;s the best possible position for a band to be in.&quot; The album was preceded by the &quot;&#x27;Merican&quot; EP in February 2004, followed by the full-length album in March. &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; was released in both CD and LP formats, with a cover illustration drawn by Chris Shary depicting the band&#x27;s Milo caricature drawn on graph paper.

In October 2008, founding member Frank Navetta died after &quot;becoming ill over the course of a few days&quot;. The official website of the Descendents gave its grief to Frank, &quot;We&#x27;re very sorry to announce that founding member of The DESCENDENTS, and close friend Frank Navetta died on October 31, 2008 after becoming ill over the course of a few days. This is obviously a huge loss for the DESCENDENTS family. His contribution to the band, and to music in general can not be overstated. Frank will be truly missed.&quot;

In 2010 the Descendents reunited again for a series of gigs. According to Milo, the reunion is not an official reformation. He classified these as &quot;one-off shows&quot;, usually occurring when he is able to take advantage of vacation breaks as working as a biologist to perform with the Descendents.

A documentary called Filmage documenting the story behind the Descendents and All premiered at Bloor Hot Docs cinema in Toronto on June, 15th 2013 as part of the NXNE Music and Film festival. Directed by Matt Riggle and Deedle LaCour, Filmage had a limited theatrical run in Los Angeles starting September, 26th 2014 and was released in the US and Canada on VOD, Digital and Blu-ray/DVD September, 30th 2014.

In May 2015 it was announced by Stevenson that the band had been working on some demo songs for a new album, which could possibly be released mid-2016. On April 22, 2016, it was announced that the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Hypercaffium Spazzinate&quot;, along with an accompanying EP with five bonus tracks from the recording sessions entitled &quot;Spazzhazard&quot; would be released through Epitaph in July.

On June 7, the debut single from &quot;Hypercaffium Spazzinate&quot;, &quot;Victim of Me&quot;, was released on all streaming services. In July 2016, Milo announced he would be leaving his scientific career to pursue the Descendents full-time, citing burnout with biochemistry and getting laid off from DuPont.

=== New singles and &quot;9th &amp; Walnut&quot; (2018–present) ===
In a March 2019 interview with &quot;OC Register&quot;, Aukerman revealed that Descendents were working on a new album: &quot;When we put out the last record we thought, &#x27;OK, I bet we could put out another record after this one and not wait a decade to do it.&#x27; It was such a rewarding experience and you know what? Our fans deserve better. They deserve more than a record every decade or so. We started writing almost immediately after that record was done. I have been writing and Stephen (Egerton) has really picked up the mantle, too. Between us I think we have like 20 songs written and Bill (Stevenson) and Karl (Alvarez) have been writing songs as well. We&#x27;ve done some basic tracking, but it&#x27;s still a work in progress but I hope we&#x27;ll have something out by the end of the year.&quot;

In 2020, they released a single to streaming services, entitled &quot;Suffrage&quot; and including two songs, &quot;On You&quot; and &quot;Hindsight 2020&quot;.

On May 4, 2021, the band put out a single called &quot;Baby Doncha Know&quot; and announced their eighth album that would be released on July 23 titled &quot;9th &amp; Walnut,&quot; named after the intersection in Long Beach, California, where their first rehearsal space was located. The album was recorded primarily during a 2002 session featuring the original lineup of Stevenson, Frank Navetta, and Tony Lombardo, with Milo Aukerman recording his lead vocals for the album at home in Delaware during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contains eighteen songs written by the band between 1977 and 1981, including re-recorded versions of &quot;Ride the Wild&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Hectic World&quot;. The album serves as the band&#x27;s first recording since &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; to feature this &quot;classic&quot; lineup.

==Artistry==
===Musical style and instrumentation===

Over the years, the Descendents style of music has changed from short under a minute hardcore style songs to average length 2–3 minute punk rock songs. The lyrical content of the Descendents made them being cited at the time as one of the most significant punk bands of the 1980s hardcore punk movement. Critics have cited that their earlier music style which reflected hardcore punk being influential to modern day skate punk and pop-punk. Steven Blush, author of &quot;American Hardcore: A Tribal History&quot;, remarked that their &quot;cheeky love songs disguised as hardcore blasts became the most aped formula in rock.&quot; Ned Raggett of AllMusic in his review of &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; called it &quot;an unpretentious, catchy winner. The playing of the core band is even better than before, never mistaking increased skill with needing to show off; the Lombardo/Stevenson rhythm section is in perfect sync, while Navetta provides the corrosive power. Add in Aukerman&#x27;s in-your-face hilarity and fuck-off stance, and it&#x27;s punk rock that wears both its adolescence and brains on its sleeve.&quot;

Bill Stevenson attributed the change of their sound to the band&#x27;s invention of the &quot;Bonus Cup&quot;: &quot;We took ⅓ of a cup of instant coffee grounds, added some hot water, threw in about 5 spoonfuls of sugar, and proceeded to play 10 second songs. The Bonus Cup became a part of everyday Descendents life.&quot; Aukerman later recalled: &quot;We started drinking too much coffee; &#x27;cause of that and the addition of me, the music became very quick and all about bursts of energy. It&#x27;s interesting: we started very melodic, then moved to hardcore, but melded the two at a certain point and became melodic hardcore.&quot;

During the band&#x27;s first reformation, the songs got longer, darker, and experimental. &quot;Enjoy!&quot; was marked by the use of toilet humor, with references to defecation and flatulence in its artwork, the title track, and &quot;Orgofart&quot;. It also displayed a darker, more heavy metal-influenced sound in songs like &quot;Hürtin&#x27; Crüe&quot;, &quot;Days Are Blood&quot;, and &quot;Orgo 51&quot;, with other songs recalling the pop-influenced punk of the band&#x27;s previous efforts.

===Lyrics===
The songs on &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; and &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; address topics including love and relationships, sociopolitical commentary, the death of parents, nerdiness, and flatulence. Merican&quot; addresses positive and negative aspects of American history, celebrating cultural figures such as Otis Redding, Duke Ellington, and Walt Whitman while condemning slavery, Joseph McCarthy, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Vietnam War. Stevenson wrote &quot;One More Day&quot; about the death of his father, who he had taken in and cared for throughout the last year of his life: &quot;He and I always had a terrible relationship. We spent a good part of my adult life being somewhat estranged from each other. He became ill and I took care of him for a little while. And then he died. That song is just about his and my relationship. Just to get that out of me and not holding it inside anymore, is a huge relief for me [...] Every single time I hear that song, it just freaks me out. I&#x27;ve never, ever written a song that&#x27;s freaked me out that much.&quot;

==Milo character==
A caricature of singer Milo Aukerman has been a mascot for the Descendents since the early 1980s, appearing on the covers of five of the band&#x27;s seven studio albums. The character was created by Rodger Deuerlein, a classmate of Aukerman and drummer Bill Stevenson&#x27;s at Mira Costa High School who taunted Aukerman by drawing comic strips and posters depicting him as the class nerd. &quot;He usually used me to make campaigns for people running for class office. [...] I remember him making one that said &#x27;Don&#x27;t be a nerd like Milo, vote for Billy!&#x27; or something like that.&quot; For the cover of the Descendents&#x27; first album, &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; (1982), Stevenson asked friend Jeff &quot;Rat&quot; Atkinson to draw his own interpretation of Deuerlein&#x27;s Milo character: &quot;I go &#x27;Roger does the drawing, recalled Atkinson, &quot;He goes &#x27;No, you gotta do it.&#x27; I said &#x27;Okay, what kind of Milo do you want?&#x27; So I draw him a Milo. First was the crew neck T-shirt, then I drew the polo shirt Milo, then I drew the Milo with a tie, because he goes to college. Bill goes &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s it&#x27;, and it becomes the cover of the first record.&quot; For the band&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot;, the character was reinterpreted as a baby. When the band&#x27;s name was changed to All upon Aukerman&#x27;s departure in 1987, bassist Karl Alvarez created the character Allroy to serve an equivalent function for the new band.

In addition to appearing on much of the Descendents&#x27; merchandise and promotional materials, the Milo character has been reinterpreted by other artists for all of the band&#x27;s releases since 1996:
*Reading a newspaper on the cover of &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; (1996). The full illustration, used for the lyric sheet and the &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot; single, depicts the character sitting atop the tank of an overflowing toilet as it floods the room around him and a mushroom cloud forms outside the window. This illustration is credited to &quot;Grey Stool&quot;, though Aukerman notes it was created by &quot;the kind people at Epitaph [Records]&quot;.
*As an elderly man in a wheelchair on the cover of the &quot;When I Get Old&quot; single (1997)
*Dressed as Uncle Sam, in two versions, on the cover of &quot;&#x27;Merican&quot; (2004), as drawn by Jeff Hagedorn
*Drawn on graph paper on the cover of &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; (2004), as illustrated by Chris Shary. Shary also drew the character as an old man for the cover of the Descendents tribute album &quot;Milo Turns 50&quot; (2013), published by &quot;Filter&quot; magazine, and a more detailed depiction of the character as the promotional artwork for &quot;Filmage&quot;, a 2013 documentary film about the Descendents and All.
*As an Erlenmeyer flask on the cover of &quot;Hypercaffium Spazzinate&quot; (2016)&quot;.&quot;

The Descendents have been cited as hugely influential to a large number of modern-day punk bands such as Blink-182, MXPX, NOFX, Green Day, Pennywise, Propagandhi, Rise Against, the All-American Rejects, the Bouncing Souls, the Offspring, and the Ataris. &quot;Everything about how I sing and play guitar came from this band [...] Blink is absolutely a product of The Descendents,&quot; said Blink-182 vocalist/guitarist Tom DeLonge in 2011, while vocalist/bassist Mark Hoppus called &quot;Silly Girl&quot; from &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; (1985) &quot;the first song that really altered my life. [...] It spoke to me in a way that nothing did.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Filmage: The Story of Descendents/All&quot;, a documentary on the band, premiered. The film features interviews with Hoppus, Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters, and Mike Watt of Minutemen.

&quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; has been included in several lists of noteworthy punk albums. &quot;Spin&quot; has listed it several times, ranking it No. 74 in a 1995 list of the best alternative albums and No. 20 in a 2001 list of &quot;The 50 Most Essential Punk Records&quot;, and including it in a 2004 list of &quot;Essential Hardcore&quot; albums. In these lists, critic Simon Reynolds described the album as &quot;Fifteen Cali-core paroxysms that anatomize dork-dude pangs with haiku brevity&quot;, while Andrew Beaujon called it &quot;Super clean, super tight, super poppy hardcore about hating your parents, riding bikes, and not wanting to &#x27;smell your muff.&#x27; In 2006 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it as the 33rd greatest punk album of all time. The German edition of the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time ranked it at 349.

In 2016, a Descendents branded IPA entitled &quot;Feel This Coffee&quot; was released by the San Diego branch of Mikkeller Brewery. It is named after a track from their 2016 album Hypercaffium Spazzinate.

<doc id="157598" wikidata="Q832141" url="?curid=157598" title="Down (band)">
<text>Down is an American heavy metal supergroup that formed in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1991. The current lineup consists of vocalist Phil Anselmo (Pantera and Superjoint Ritual), drummer Jimmy Bower (Crowbar, Eyehategod, Superjoint Ritual), guitarists Pepper Keenan (Corrosion of Conformity) and Kirk Windstein (Crowbar), and bassist Pat Bruders (Goatwhore).

Since their formation, Down has gone on hiatus twice and has released five studio albums. The first three were LPs entitled &quot;NOLA&quot; (1995), &quot;Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow&quot; (2002), and &quot;Down III: Over the Under&quot; (2007). In 2008, the band began working on additional material, which resulted in two EPs entitled &quot;Down IV – Part I&quot;, released in September 2012, and &quot;Down IV – Part II&quot;, released in May 2014.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;NOLA&quot; (1991–1998)===


Down formed in 1991 with vocalist Phil Anselmo of Pantera, drummer Jimmy Bower of Eyehategod, guitarists Pepper Keenan of Corrosion of Conformity and Kirk Windstein of Crowbar and bassist Todd Strange, also of Crowbar. All of the band members were longtime friends, and shared interest in bands such as Black Sabbath, Trouble, and Saint Vitus, which would significantly influence the music they made. The band made a three-track demo for underground trading. In an effort to build a fan base, Anselmo and Keenan would ask heavy metal fans if they had ever &quot;heard of this band, Down&quot; and hand them copies of the tape without telling the person that they were in the band. Eventually, the tape was distributed throughout the United States and Down played a small concert in its hometown. A record executive from Elektra Records was attending the show. When he found out who the members of the band were, he signed Down to a recording contract.

Down released its debut album, &quot;NOLA&quot;, on September 19, 1995, debuting at number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. AllMusic reviewer David Reamer gave the album a nearly perfect 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising the songs &quot;Temptations Wings&quot;, &quot;Stone the Crow&quot;, and &quot;Bury Me in Smoke&quot;. Reamer stated that &quot;this is a landmark album that combines the talents of dedicated rock musicians, and should be included in any collection of heavy metal music.&quot; &quot;NOLA&quot; was supported by a 13-date tour, and afterward the band went on hiatus in order to return to their respective bands.

===&quot;A Bustle in Your Hedgerow&quot; and &quot;Over the Under&quot; (1999–2008)===
In 1999, while Down was on hiatus, Strange left the band and was replaced by Pantera bassist Rex Brown. In late November 2001, Down came back from hiatus to make another record. The band wrote and recorded &quot;Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow&quot; in 28 &quot;drug and booze induced&quot; days in Phil Anselmo&#x27;s barn called &quot;Nödferatu&#x27;s Lair.&quot; The album was released on March 26, 2002, but was not received with the same positive reviews as &quot;NOLA.&quot; Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin stated, &quot;&quot;Down II&quot; appears to have been thrown together more haphazardly, with much of the material falling short of the standard set by the Down&#x27;s classic debut offering.&quot; Despite mixed reviews, the album debuted at number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. To support the album, Down toured on the second stage of Ozzfest in 2002. Also in 2002, the band recorded an acoustic version of &quot;Stone the Crow&quot; that was never officially released although it can be heard on YouTube. Afterward, the band once again entered an indefinite hiatus to focus on their respective bands.

Newly signed to Warner Bros. Records, Down once again reformed in 2006. The band wrote an album over the course of a year. The lyrical content of &quot;Down III: Over the Under&quot; covers subjects such as the breakup of Pantera, the murder of ex-Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, the band&#x27;s anger at the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and Anselmo&#x27;s recovery from back surgery and drug addiction. Debuting at number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album was released on September 25, 2007, and received generally positive reviews. Kirk Miller of &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; said of the album, &quot;for almost an hour, it&#x27;s like the metal world was set right again.&quot;

The release of &quot;Over the Under&quot; was preceded by a tour with Heaven &amp; Hell and Megadeth. To further support their album, Down headlined a tour starting at the end of September 2007.

On April 22, 2008, the BBC Radio 1 Rockshow broadcast a new session of Down recordings featuring alternate versions of &quot;N.O.D.&quot;, &quot;Beneath the Tides&quot;, and &quot;Jail&quot;, along with a cover of &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; (written by Kansas Joe McCoy and his wife Memphis Minnie, and famously covered by Led Zeppelin).

===&quot;Diary of a Mad Band&quot; (2008–2010)===

On July 24, 2008, frontman Phil Anselmo mentioned in a post on the band&#x27;s Myspace blog that Down had been &quot;fucking around with some new material&quot; and had &quot;enough material already recorded&quot;—at least six new songs in addition to those that did not make the final cut on &quot;Down III: Over the Under&quot;. What or how much will be included on the tentative &quot;Down IV&quot; is uncertain, but according to Anselmo, there is &quot;definitely enough for an awesome EP, with some surprises within.&quot;

Asked in November 2008 what the current status of the new album was, bassist Rex Brown told Billboard.com that Down had been &quot;writing constantly on the road. We still have all these ideas, and we play a lot of new stuff at sound check, just to feel it out. Hopefully, we can get back in the studio in the fall and work on something.&quot;

On February 18, 2009, Down was announced in the lineup for the 2009 Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Following these live dates, the band toured the United States and Canada during August and September 2009. On March 30, 2009, Down posted a statement on their message board indicating that they will be back in the studio from October through November writing and recording what will eventually become &quot;Down IV&quot;. In the summer of 2009, Down began a US tour without Rex on bass, who had developed acute pancreatitis.

On January 27, 2010, it was announced that Brown had nearly fully recuperated from his fight with pancreatitis. Down had discussed reconvening in New Orleans sometime after the 2010 Super Bowl to begin work on a new album. With a release date yet to be announced, the new album will be the band&#x27;s fourth studio offering. After legal issues with Warner Brothers Records regarding the rights to the music, Down released the live album &quot;Diary of a Mad Band: Europe in the Year of VI&quot; on October 5, 2010, via Roadrunner Records. The title is a reference to &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, an Ozzy Osbourne album.

===Brown&#x27;s and Windstein&#x27;s departures and EPs (2011–2014)===
In 2011, Phil Anselmo commented on the future of Down, stating: &quot;Man, there will be a time for Down. Matter of fact we had a meeting this past week, and I know Jimmy&#x27;s gotta go do an Eyehategod tour in February. But after that, I think we&#x27;re looking to do some shows starting in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they&#x27;re working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it&#x27;s got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin&#x27; practice room. So all this is going to happen this year. It has to happen. I know there&#x27;s a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don&#x27;t want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We&#x27;ve demoed other songs, there&#x27;s songs that haven&#x27;t even been released that people have never heard, so there&#x27;s always Down there. For all you people out there, don&#x27;t you stress. We got the Down coming.&quot;

On May 11, 2011, Down announced on their Facebook page that they &quot;demoed a brand new tune.&quot; Down played at Download Festival on Saturday June 11, 2011. They played alongside System of a Down, Avenged Sevenfold and Alice Cooper. Rex did not tour with Down during their spring 2011 shows. Crowbar bassist Pat Bruders filled in for Rex during those shows. &quot;Rex is not gonna be with us,&quot; said Keenan. &quot;He&#x27;s got things he needs to deal with, and we gave him an ultimatum and he&#x27;s trying to work things out. We&#x27;ve got Pat (Bruders) from Crowbar playing bass, and he&#x27;s ass-kickin&#x27; in the same way. He plays with his fingers—which is really cool; he&#x27;s got the whole Geezer Butler thing going on.&quot; When asked whether or not Brown was still considered a part of the band, Keenan was hopeful but hesitant: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to really say on that; he&#x27;s not out of the band, but he&#x27;s not playing with us live.&quot; On June 22, 2011, Jimmy Bower announced that Rex Brown would not be returning to Down, and that Pat Bruders is his replacement.

The band spoke on their Facebook page and said they started recording new material on October 20. On January 16, 2012, they revealed track names for the new EP on Facebook. Initially, rumors spread about the possibility of Down releasing four EPs, instead of an album. However, when asked about it in an interview with Scuzz TV, Anselmo said that &quot;It would be too pretentious, we try not to think as far ahead as that, and just go with what we feel at the time.&quot; In the summer of 2013, Kirk Windstein quit the band and was replaced by Bobby Landgraf. &quot;Down IV – Part II&quot; was released on May 13, 2014.

Following Anselmo&#x27;s white power and Nazi salute controversy during the Dimebash event in the United States, the organizers of FortaRock Festival decided to cancel the appearance of the band for the 2016 event.

===Next album (2018–present)===
When speaking to Max Morin of Bucketlist Music Reviews in January 2018, Anselmo said about the follow-up album to 2007&#x27;s &quot;Over the Under&quot;: 

In November 2019, Down announced they would be reuniting for a series of shows in 2020, including Graspop Metal Meeting, set to take place June 18–21, 2020 in Dessel, Belgium. In anticipation of the 25th anniversary of Down&#x27;s first album &quot;NOLA&quot;, founding member Kirk Windstein confirmed he was returning to the band. During a December 2019 interview with BraveWorlds, Windstein said &quot;anything Down does from here forward, whether it’s a full tour or one show, I&#x27;m 99.9% sure that I&#x27;m a part of it.&quot;

<text>Scotland is a well-developed tourist destination, with tourism generally being responsible for sustaining 200,000 jobs mainly in the service sector, with tourist spending averaging at £4bn per year. In 2013, for example, UK visitors made 18.5 million visits to Scotland, staying 64.5 million nights and spending £3.7bn. In contrast, overseas residents made 1.58 million visits to Scotland, staying 15 million nights and spending £806m. In terms of overseas visitors, those from the United States made up 24% of visits to Scotland, with the United States being the largest source of overseas visitors, and Germany (9%), France (8%), Canada (7%) and Australia (6%), following behind.

Scotland is generally seen as a destination with beautiful scenery combined with thousands of historic sites and attractions. These include prehistoric stone circles, standing stones and burial chambers, and various Bronze Age, Iron Age and Stone Age remains. There are many historic castles, houses, and battlegrounds, ruins and museums. Many people are drawn by the culture of Scotland.

The main tourist season is generally from April to October. In addition to these factors, the national tourist agency, VisitScotland, have deployed a strategy of niche marketing, aimed at exploiting, amongst other things, Scotland&#x27;s strengths in golf, fishing and food and drink tourism.

==Statistics==
Most visitors (for any purpose) to Scotland in 2018 came from the following countries:
==Tourist destinations==
* Edinburgh is the capital city. The Old and New Towns of the city constitute a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Edinburgh is the largest tourist destination in Scotland, and the second largest in the United Kingdom after London. The cities&#x27; major tourist attractions include Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh Zoo, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, Our Dynamic Earth and the Royal Mile. It has four universities including the University of Edinburgh founded in 1583.
* Glasgow is the largest city in the country, and the second largest tourist destination after Edinburgh. Its attractions include the Burrell Collection, Glasgow Cathedral, the Glasgow Science Centre and the Kelvingrove Museum. In addition tourists come to Glasgow for its renowned Victorian architecture and Gothic architecture as well as its shopping. The city has three universities, including the University of Glasgow founded in 1451, and is a UNESCO City of Music which hosts the world renowned Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and Royal Scottish National Orchestra.
* Stirling is a historic city in central Scotland, 30 miles to the north-west of Edinburgh, and is generally known as the &quot;Gateway to the Highlands&quot;, due to its geographical position between highland and lowland Scotland. Amongst its attractions are Stirling Castle, the Wallace National Monument and the Thieves Pot/Thistles Centre.
* Aberdeen is known as the &quot;Granite City&quot; and is renowned for its gothic architecture. It is a city of approximately 210,000 people and serves as the main administrative centre for the north-east of Scotland. With its large port and harbour, Aberdeen serves as the departure point for the ferries that connect the Scottish mainland with the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland. Aberdeen has two universities, and a large student population.
* St Andrews is a small, but busy town in north-east Fife. The royal burgh&#x27;s economy is centred on the golf industry, with St Andrews being regarded as the home of the modern game. The University of St Andrews (the oldest in Scotland) has colleges located throughout the town and a small museum on the history of the University which is open to the public free of charge.
* Dundee is known as the &quot;City of Discovery&quot; and is the home of V&amp;A Dundee, Scotland&#x27;s first and only design museum. Dundee is home to Scott of the Antarctic&#x27;s ship the RRS &quot;Discovery&quot;. Dundee has two universities. It has a Jute museum called Verdant Works, an Anchor Point of ERIH – The European Route of Industrial Heritage.
* Perth is a small but historic city on the east coast, which stands on the River Tay. Perth is known for its abundant parkland. Close by is the village of Scone, ancient capital of Scotland and former home to Scottish kings.
* Inverness is the administrative centre for the Highlands, close to Loch Ness and serves as a transport hub for much of the Highlands, with rail and bus services departing here to much of the northern and west Highlands. It is a popular destination for tourists wishing to explore the north of Scotland.
* Ayrshire offers wonderful scenery, outdoor activities, enthralling history with links to William Wallace, Robert the Bruce and Scotland&#x27;s best known poet, Robert Burns. Ayrshire offers some of the finest golf courses in the world (32 in total). North Ayrshire hosts Kelburn Castle which is famous for its Graffiti Project.

Other areas which are popular for tourists include the Highlands and the Hebrides, such as the Isle of Skye. Perthshire, the Scottish Borders and Orkney and Shetland are popular tourism destinations.

Ben Nevis is the highest mountain in the United Kingdom, but there are many other significant mountains in Scotland, albeit relatively small by international standards. The Cuillin on the Isle of Skye offer challenging climbs such as the Inaccessible Pinnacle.

Scotland has amusement parks such as M&amp;D&#x27;s in the town of Motherwell, North Lanarkshire.

Scotland has many lochs, including Loch Lomond, and Loch Ness, home of the mythical Loch Ness monster. Rivers such as the Spey, Tay, Tweed, and Aberdeenshire Dee are famous for salmon and fly fishing. Scotland is a popular destination for hunting, especially deer and grouse.

Scotland&#x27;s best known export is Scotch Whisky and numerous visitors a year enjoy a tour around its Whisky distilleries. The Highlands is by far the largest region in Scotland both in area and in whisky production. This massive area has over 30 distilleries on the mainland. When the Islands sub-region is included, the total number of distilleries is 47. 
 The nearby Speyside area has the largest number of distilleries including Aberlour, Balvenie, Cardhu, Cragganmore, Dalwhinnie, Glenfarclas, Glenglassaugh, Glenfiddich, Speyburn, The Macallan, The Glenlivet, and The Glenrothes. Distilleries are the third most visited attractions in Scotland; roughly 2 million visits were recorded in 2018. 68 distilleries operate visitors&#x27; centres in Scotland and another eight accept visits by appointment. The tourism has had an especially visible impact on the economy in some remote rural areas.

Scotland is the home of golf, with historic and famous courses including St Andrews, Gleneagles, Royal Troon, Carnoustie, and Muirfield. There are hundreds of other courses in the country.

==Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic==
Like all of the UK, Scotland was negatively impacted by the restrictions and lockdowns necessitated by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Tourism has particularly suffered. In October 2020, the Scottish Tourism Alliance made this comment: &quot;The devastating impact of this pandemic will make recovery incredibly challenging, if not questionable, without the assurance of continued targeted support from both the Scottish and UK Governments&quot;. The First Minister acknowledged the setbacks that the hospitality/tourism sector had already experienced in a March 2021 speech when she announced financial support for the industry. &quot;It&#x27;s been an incredibly difficult year for all businesses&quot; and added that she did not &quot;underestimate the acute challenges our tourism and hospitality sectors have faced&quot;.

Most reports that provide statistics on the impact of the pandemic on tourism cover the entire UK as an entity rather than specifically for Scotland. VisitBritain in April 2021, stated that the travel restrictions and lockdowns in the UK led to a 76% reduction in &quot;inbound tourism&quot; to the UK in 2020 and forecast for 2021 indicated an estimated that visits would be up &quot;21% on 2020 but only 29% of the 2019 level&quot;. An increase in visits was expected but slowly at first and the report concluded that tourism was not expected to come &quot;even close to normal levels&quot;.

The VisitBritain report in April 2021 discussed the effects of the pandemic on domestic within the UK in 2020, citing a significant reduction in spending, for an estimated decline of 62% over the previous year. As of January 2021, the forecast for 2021 suggested that spending would increase by 79% over the previous year and that &quot;the value of spending will be back to 84% of 2019 levels&quot; by the end of 2021.

A report published in March 2021 by the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde indicated that in the UK, &quot;tourism and hospitality suffered notable losses from the pandemic&quot; and provided detailed specifics for both domestic and international visits. This report reviewed the Scottish hospitality industry in great detail; the situation was not yet optimistic at that time, with &quot;no sign of a trend reversal with more than 70% of businesses in the sector reporting lower turnover than usual&quot;.

The Scottish Tourism Alliance Task Force published its recommendations in October 2020, with &quot;Immediate Actions&quot; for both the Scottish government and the UK government. The group particularly requested support for the tourism/hospitality industry, including financial grants, the funding of marketing for the sector, and a &quot;temporary removal of Air Passenger Duty to boost route competitiveness&quot;. On 24 March 2021, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a £25 million tourism recovery programme &quot;to support the industry for the next 6 months to two years&quot;. Sturgeon reminded the hospitality/tourism industry that the government had provided &quot;over £129 million&quot; in support &quot;for this sector&quot;.

On 5 April 2021, the BBC published specifics about domestic tourism in the UK indicating that the restrictions were to be loosened during that month, at least for domestic travel within Scotland, Wales and England. Travel within mainland Scotland was expected to be permitted again starting on 26 April. A survey in March 2021 indicated that roughly 70% of the 500 Scots surveyed were hoping to &quot;have a holiday at home this year&quot;. The BBC recommended such &quot;staycationing&quot; but reminded readers that travel to &quot;Scotland&#x27;s islands or across the border at Gretna and Berwick&quot; might not be possible for some time.

The VisitBritain website discussed the UK&#x27;s &quot;COVID-19 restrictions&quot; that were expected to be loosened in April but indicated that there was no confirmation as to whether the rules on international travel, either inbound or outbound, would actually be loosened in mid-May.

It was possible that the UK&#x27;s plan to loosen restrictions on inbound tourists would not commence as early as planned. On 8 April 2021 sources in the European Union stated that a &quot;third wave of the pandemic [was sweeping] the continent&quot;. (Two days earlier, PM Boris Johnson had made it clear that &quot;We don&#x27;t want to see the virus being reimported into this country from abroad&quot;.) Of particular concern was the B117 variant, a mutation of the virus, &quot;which [was] spreading rapidly in at least 27 European countries&quot;.

Travel restrictions were loosened in England on 12 April 2021, but not in Scotland. Some lockdown measures were expected to be relaxed on 26 April. It was hoped that domestic travel would again be allowed and that cafes and restaurants would be permitted to re-open at least their outdoor facilities, as in England.

<doc id="157606" wikidata="Q5861" url="?curid=157606" title="Glass fiber">
<text>Glass fiber (or glass fibre) is a material consisting of numerous extremely fine fibers of glass.

Glassmakers throughout history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass manufacture of glass fiber was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter and texture of silk fibers. Glass fibers can also occur naturally, as Pele&#x27;s hair.

Glass wool, which is one product called &quot;fiberglass&quot; today, was invented some time between 1932 and 1933 by Games Slayter of Owens-Illinois, as a material to be used as thermal building insulation. It is marketed under the trade name Fiberglas, which has become a genericized trademark. Glass fiber, when used as a thermal insulating material, is specially manufactured with a bonding agent to trap many small air cells, resulting in the characteristically air-filled low-density &quot;glass wool&quot; family of products.

Glass fiber has roughly comparable mechanical properties to other fibers such as polymers and carbon fiber. Although not as rigid as carbon fiber, it is much cheaper and significantly less brittle when used in composites. Glass fiber reinforced composites are used in marine industry and piping industries because of good environmental resistance, better damage tolerance for impact loading, high specific strength and stiffness.

==Fiber formation==
Glass fiber is formed when thin strands of silica-based or other formulation glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing. The technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia, and was practiced in Egypt and Venice. Before the recent use of these fibers for textile applications, all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple (that is, clusters of short lengths of fiber).

The modern method for producing glass wool is the invention of Games Slayter working at the Owens-Illinois Glass Company (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933. The first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936. In 1938 Owens-Illinois Glass Company and Corning Glass Works joined to form the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation. When the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber, they introduced continuous filament glass fibers. Owens-Corning is still the major glass-fiber producer in the market today.

The most common type of glass fiber used in fiberglass is &quot;E-glass&quot;, which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of glass used are &quot;A-glass&quot; (Alkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide), &quot;E-CR-glass&quot; (Electrical/Chemical Resistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), &quot;C-glass&quot; (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), &quot;D-glass&quot; (borosilicate glass, named for its low dielectric constant), &quot;R-glass&quot; (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as &quot;r&quot;einforcement), and &quot;S-glass&quot; (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with high tensile strength).

Pure silica (silicon dioxide), when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point, can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass, but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures. In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as &quot;fluxing agents&quot; (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass (&quot;A&quot; for &quot;alkali-lime&quot;) or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called cullet glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass (&quot;E&quot; because of initial electrical application), is alkali free, and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass (&quot;S&quot; for &quot;Strength&quot;) is used when high tensile strength (modulus) is important, and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction. The same substance is known as R-glass (&quot;R&quot; for &quot;reinforcement&quot;) in Europe. C-glass (&quot;C&quot; for &quot;chemical resistance&quot;) and &quot;T-glass&quot; (&quot;T&quot; is for &quot;thermal insulator&quot; – a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.
==Chemistry==
The basis of textile-grade glass fibers is silica, SiO2. In its pure form it exists as a polymer, (SiO2)n. It has no true melting point but softens up to 1200 °C, where it starts to degrade. At 1713 °C, most of the molecules can move about freely. If the glass is extruded and cooled quickly at this temperature, it will be unable to form an ordered structure. In the polymer it forms SiO4 groups which are configured as a tetrahedron with the silicon atom at the center, and four oxygen atoms at the corners. These atoms then form a network bonded at the corners by sharing the oxygen atoms.

The vitreous and crystalline states of silica (glass and quartz) have similar energy levels on a molecular basis, also implying that the glassy form is extremely stable. In order to induce crystallization, it must be heated to temperatures above 1200 °C for long periods of time.

Although pure silica is a perfectly viable glass and glass fiber, it must be worked with at very high temperatures, which is a drawback unless its specific chemical properties are needed. It is usual to introduce impurities into the glass in the form of other materials to lower its working temperature. These materials also impart various other properties to the glass that may be beneficial in different applications. The first type of glass used for fiber was soda lime glass or A-glass (&quot;A&quot; for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A newer, alkali-free (&lt;2%) type, E-glass, is an alumino-borosilicate glass. C-glass was developed to resist attack from chemicals, mostly acids that destroy E-glass. T-glass is a North American variant of C-glass. AR-glass is alkali-resistant glass. Most glass fibers have limited solubility in water but are very dependent on pH. Chloride ions will also attack and dissolve E-glass surfaces.

E-glass does not actually melt, but softens instead, the softening point being &quot;the temperature at which a 0.55–0.77 mm diameter fiber 235 mm long, elongates under its own weight at 1 mm/min when suspended vertically and heated at the rate of 5 °C per minute&quot;. The strain point is reached when the glass has a viscosity of 1014.5 poise. The annealing point, which is the temperature where the internal stresses are reduced to an acceptable commercial limit in 15 minutes, is marked by a viscosity of 1013 poise.

==Properties==

===Thermal===

Fabrics of woven glass fibers are useful thermal insulators because of their high ratio of surface area to weight. However, the increased surface area makes them much more susceptible to chemical attack. By trapping air within them, blocks of glass fiber make good thermal insulation, with a thermal conductivity of the order of 0.05 W/(m·K).

===Selected properties===

=== Mechanical properties ===
The strength of glass is usually tested and reported for &quot;virgin&quot; or pristine fibers—those that have just been manufactured. The freshest, thinnest fibers are the strongest because the thinner fibers are more ductile. The more the surface is scratched, the less the resulting . Because glass has an amorphous structure, its properties are the same along the fiber and across the fiber. Humidity is an important factor in the tensile strength. Moisture is easily adsorbed and can worsen microscopic cracks and surface defects, and lessen tenacity.

In contrast to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass is very important for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.

==Manufacturing processes==

=== Melting ===
There are two main types of glass fiber manufacture and two main types of glass fiber product. First, fiber is made either from a direct melt process or a marble remelt process. Both start with the raw materials in solid form. The materials are mixed together and melted in a furnace. Then, for the marble process, the molten material is sheared and rolled into marbles which are cooled and packaged. The marbles are taken to the fiber manufacturing facility where they are inserted into a can and remelted. The molten glass is extruded to the bushing to be formed into fiber. In the direct melt process, the molten glass in the furnace goes directly to the bushing for formation.

=== Formation ===
The bushing plate is the most important part of the machinery for making the fiber. This is a small metal furnace containing nozzles for the fiber to be formed through. It is almost always made of platinum alloyed with rhodium for durability. Platinum is used because the glass melt has a natural affinity for wetting it. When bushings were first used they were pure platinum, and the glass wetted the bushing so easily that it ran under the plate after exiting the nozzle and accumulated on the underside. Also, due to its cost and the tendency to wear, the platinum was alloyed with rhodium. In the direct melt process, the bushing serves as a collector for the molten glass. It is heated slightly to keep the glass at the correct temperature for fiber formation. In the marble melt process, the bushing acts more like a furnace as it melts more of the material.

Bushings are the major expense in fiber glass production. The nozzle design is also critical. The number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in multiples of 200. The important part of the nozzle in continuous filament manufacture is the thickness of its walls in the exit region. It was found that inserting a counterbore here reduced wetting. Today, the nozzles are designed to have a minimum thickness at the exit. As glass flows through the nozzle, it forms a drop which is suspended from the end. As it falls, it leaves a thread attached by the meniscus to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation. The smaller the annular ring of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit, the faster the drop will form and fall away, and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle. The surface tension of the glass is what influences the formation of the meniscus. For E-glass it should be around 400 mN/m.

The attenuation (drawing) speed is important in the nozzle design. Although slowing this speed down can make coarser fiber, it is uneconomic to run at speeds for which the nozzles were not designed.

=== Continuous filament process ===
In the continuous filament process, after the fiber is drawn, a size is applied. This size helps protect the fiber as it is wound onto a bobbin. The particular size applied relates to end-use. While some sizes are processing aids, others make the fiber have an affinity for a certain resin, if the fiber is to be used in a composite. Size is usually added at 0.5–2.0% by weight. Winding then takes place at around 1 km/min.

=== Staple fiber process ===
For staple fiber production, there are a number of ways to manufacture the fiber. The glass can be blown or blasted with heat or steam after exiting the formation machine. Usually these fibers are made into some sort of mat. The most common process used is the rotary process. Here, the glass enters a rotating spinner, and due to centrifugal force is thrown out horizontally. The air jets push it down vertically, and binder is applied. Then the mat is vacuumed to a screen and the binder is cured in the oven.

==Safety==
Glass fiber has increased in popularity since the discovery that asbestos causes cancer and its subsequent removal from most products. Following this increase in popularity, the safety of glass fiber has also been called into question. Research shows that the composition of glass fiber can cause similar toxicity as asbestos since both are silicate fibers.

Studies on rats conducted during the 1970s found that fibrous glass of less than 3 μm in diameter and greater than 20 μm in length is a &quot;potent carcinogen&quot;. Likewise, the International Agency for Research on Cancer found it &quot;may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen&quot; in 1990. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, on the other hand, says that there is insufficient evidence, and that glass fiber is in group A4: &quot;Not classifiable as a human carcinogen&quot;.

The North American Insulation Manufacturers Association (NAIMA) claims that glass fiber is fundamentally different from asbestos, since it is man-made instead of naturally occurring. They claim that glass fiber &quot;dissolves in the lungs&quot;, while asbestos remains in the body for life. Although both glass fiber and asbestos are made from silica filaments, NAIMA claims that asbestos is more dangerous because of its crystalline structure, which causes it to cleave into smaller, more dangerous pieces, citing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services:

A 1998 study using rats found that the biopersistence of synthetic fibers after one year was 0.04–13%, but 27% for amosite asbestos. Fibers that persisted longer were found to be more carcinogenic.

== Glass-reinforced plastic (fiberglass) ==
Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) is a composite material or fiber-reinforced plastic made of a plastic reinforced by fine glass fibers. The glass can be in the form of a chopped strand mat (CSM) or a woven fabric.

As with many other composite materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.

==Uses==
Uses for regular glass fiber include mats and fabrics for thermal insulation, electrical insulation, sound insulation, high-strength fabrics or heat- and corrosion-resistant fabrics. It is also used to reinforce various materials, such as tent poles, pole vault poles, arrows, bows and crossbows, translucent roofing panels, automobile bodies, hockey sticks, surfboards, boat hulls, and paper honeycomb. It has been used for medical purposes in casts. Glass fiber is extensively used for making FRP tanks and vessels.

Open-weave glass fiber grids are used to reinforce asphalt pavement. Non-woven glass fiber/polymer blend mats are used saturated with asphalt emulsion and overlaid with asphalt, producing a waterproof, crack-resistant membrane. Use of glass-fiber reinforced polymer rebar instead of steel rebar shows promise in areas where avoidance of steel corrosion is desired.

=== Potential uses ===
Glass fiber has recently seen use in biomedical applications in the assistance of joint replacement where the electric field orientation of short phosphate glass fibers can improve osteogenic qualities through the proliferation of osteoblasts and with improved surface chemistry. Another potential use is within electronic applications as sodium based glass fibers assist or replace lithium in lithium-ion batteries due to its improved electronic properties.

==Role of recycling in glass fiber manufacturing==

Manufacturers of glass-fiber insulation can use recycled glass. Recycled glass fiber contains up to 40% recycled glass.

<doc id="157609" wikidata="Q530706" url="?curid=157609" title="The Dick Van Dyke Show">
<text>The Dick Van Dyke Show is an American sitcom created by Carl Reiner that initially aired on CBS from October 3, 1961, to June 1, 1966, with a total of 158 half-hour episodes spanning five seasons. It was produced by Calvada Productions in association with the CBS Television Network, and was shot at Desilu Studios. Other producers included Bill Persky and Sam Denoff. The music for the show&#x27;s theme song was written by Earle Hagen.

The show starred Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Rose Marie, Morey Amsterdam, and Larry Mathews. &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; centered on the work and home life of television comedy writer Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke), the head writer for the fictitious variety show &quot;The Alan Brady Show&quot; in New York, who lived in suburban New Rochelle, New York with USO dancer turned housewife Laura Petrie (Mary Tyler Moore) and young son Ritchie (Larry Mathews). The series portrayed daily life, comic scenarios that charming, goofy Rob Petrie found himself in the middle of with his family, his colleagues – Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam), Sally Rogers (Rose Marie), Mel Cooley (Richard Deacon) – and his neighbors Millie (Ann Morgan Guilbert) and Jerry Helper (Jerry Paris) and friends.

The series won 15 Emmy Awards. In 1997, the episodes &quot;Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth&quot; and &quot;It May Look Like a Walnut&quot; were ranked at 8 and 15 respectively on TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.
In 2002, the series was ranked at 13 on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and in 2013 it was ranked at 20 on their list of the 60 Best Series. Also in 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it #14 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series.

== Premise ==
The two main settings are the work and home life of Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke), the head writer of a comedy/variety show produced in Manhattan. Viewers are given an &quot;inside look&quot; at how a television show (the fictitious variety program &quot;The Alan Brady Show&quot;) was written and produced. Many scenes deal with Rob and his co-writers, Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam) and Sally Rogers (Rose Marie). Mel Cooley (Richard Deacon), a balding straight man and recipient of numerous insulting one-liners from Buddy, was the show&#x27;s producer and the brother-in-law of the show&#x27;s star, Alan Brady (Carl Reiner). As Rob, Buddy, and Sally write for a comedy show, the premise provides a built-in forum for them to constantly make jokes. Other scenes focus on the home life of Rob, his wife Laura (Mary Tyler Moore), and son Ritchie (Larry Mathews), who live in suburban New Rochelle, New York. Also often seen are their next-door neighbors and best friends, Jerry Helper (Jerry Paris), a dentist, and his wife Millie (Ann Morgan Guilbert).

Many of the characters in &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; were based on real people, as Carl Reiner created the show based on his time spent as head writer for the Sid Caesar vehicle &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;. Carl Reiner portrayed Alan Brady who is a combination of the abrasive Milton Berle and Jackie Gleason, according to Reiner, refuting rumors that Alan Brady was based on Caesar. Van Dyke&#x27;s character was based on Reiner himself. Moore&#x27;s character&#x27;s &quot;look&quot; was influenced to some extent by that of Jackie Kennedy, who was at the time First Lady of the United States.

==&quot;Head of the Family&quot; pilot==
&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; was preceded by a 1960 pilot for a series to be called &quot;Head of the Family&quot;, filmed at Gold Medal Studios,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiner/RememberMe&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Waldron/DVDSB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with a different cast, although the characters were essentially the same, except for the absence of Mel Cooley. In the pilot, Carl Reiner, who created the show based on his own experiences as a TV writer, played Robbie Petrie. Laura Petrie was played by Barbara Britton, Buddy Sorrell by Morty Gunty, Sally Rogers by Sylvia Miles, Ritchie by Gary Morgan, and Alan Sturdy, the Alan Brady character, was played by Jack Wakefield, although his face was never fully seen, which was also the case with Carl Reiner&#x27;s Alan Brady for the first three seasons of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

Broadcast on CBS as an episode of the summer anthology series &quot;The Comedy Spot&quot; on July 19, 1960, the pilot was unsuccessful. Producer Sheldon Leonard later saw Reiner&#x27;s script and concluded that the show could be successful if the character Reiner played, Rob Petrie, was recast with a different actor. Reiner reworked the show with Dick Van Dyke playing the central character (who went by Rob, not &quot;Robbie&quot;, and pronounced his last name PET-tree rather than the pilot&#x27;s PEE-tree.) 

The season one episode &quot;Father of the Week&quot; was partly based on this pilot.

==Episodes==

At least four episodes were filmed without a live studio audience: &quot;The Bad Old Days&quot;, which featured an extended flashback sequence that relied on optical effects that would have been impractical to shoot with a live audience in the studio; &quot;The Alan Brady Show Presents&quot;, which required elaborate set and costume changes; &quot;Happy Birthday and Too Many More&quot;, which was filmed on November 26, 1963, only four days after President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination; and &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;, which was filmed on location. &quot;The Last Chapter&quot; was the last episode that aired; &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; was the last episode filmed. 

===In color===
Reiner considered moving the production of the series to full color as early as season three, only to drop the idea when he was informed that it would add about US$7,000 () to the cost of each episode. In 2016, several episodes were colorized by West Wing Studios and aired on CBS.

==Characters==

Main:
* Robert &quot;Rob&quot; Simpson Petrie (Dick Van Dyke) – Rob is the head writer of the comedy writing team for the fictional TV variety show, &quot;The Alan Brady Show&quot;, working with Sally Rogers and Buddy Sorrell. When not working, Rob enjoys life with his wife Laura Petrie, played by Mary Tyler Moore, and his son, Ritchie Petrie, portrayed by Larry Mathews. Rob, Laura, and Ritchie live in New Rochelle, New York. Their neighbors are longtime friends, Millie Helper and her dentist husband Jerry Helper. Rob is a big fan of old-time radio, cowboy movies, and Laurel and Hardy, as well as an excellent mime and fan of pantomime. He incorporates many favorite routines into his comedy writing. He has living parents, Sam and Clara Petrie. Rob was born in Danville, Illinois (Dick Van Dyke&#x27;s boyhood home), along with younger brother Stacey Petrie, and served in the military at Camp Crowder, Missouri as a Special Services Sergeant. There he met his future wife, Laura Meehan, a USO dancer. After a number of jobs, he was hired by Alan Brady.
* Laura Petrie (Mary Tyler Moore) – Laura (née Meeker/Meehan) is Rob&#x27;s wife. As a 17-year-old dancer in the United Service Organizations, she met and married Rob. Then, she became a stay-at-home mom. In early Season One episodes, Rob and others call her &quot;Laurie&quot; numerous times, as opposed to &quot;Laura&quot;, which became his usual name for her. About 60 actresses auditioned for the part before Moore was signed. Moore later wrote that she almost skipped the audition. 
* Maurice &quot;Buddy&quot; Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam) – Buddy is an energetic and at times sarcastic &quot;human joke machine&quot;, and one of the comedy writers. Amsterdam was recommended for the role by Rose Marie as soon as she had signed on to the series. Buddy is constantly making fun of Mel Cooley, the show&#x27;s producer, for being bald and dull. His character is loosely based on Mel Brooks who also wrote for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;. He makes frequent jokes about his marriage to his wife, former showgirl Fiona &quot;Pickles&quot; Conway Sorrell, who is a terrible cook. In several episodes, it is mentioned that Buddy is Jewish. He was identified by his birth name, Moishe Selig, when he had his belated bar mitzvah in &quot;Buddy Sorrell – Man and Boy.&quot; Buddy plays the cello, which he sometimes incorporates into his comedy routines, and owns a large German Shepherd named Larry. Buddy made a guest appearance on the &quot;Danny Thomas Show&quot; episode, &quot;The Woman Behind the Jokes&quot; that aired October 21, 1963.
* Sally Rogers (Rose Marie) – Sally is another of the comedy writers, and the designated typist, who is always on the lookout for a husband. The character was loosely based on Selma Diamond and Lucille Kallen, both writers for &quot;Your Show of Shows.&quot; She never drinks and quotes frequently from her &quot;Aunt Agnes in Cleveland&quot;. She has an on-again/off-again relationship with her boyfriend Herman Glimscher, who seems to be too much of a mama&#x27;s boy to get married. She frequently scares men off with her sense of humor and strong personality.
* Richard &quot;Ritchie&quot; Rosebud Petrie (Larry Mathews) – Rob and Laura&#x27;s son. His middle name is an acronym for &quot;Robert Oscar Sam Edward Benjamin Ulysses David,&quot; all the names suggested by members of Rob and Laura&#x27;s families in the episode &quot;What&#x27;s in a Middle Name?&quot;.

Supporting:
* Melvin &quot;Mel&quot; Cooley (Richard Deacon) – Mel is the balding producer of &quot;The Alan Brady Show&quot; and Alan Brady&#x27;s brother-in-law. Though Mel can often be an obsequiously sycophantic yes-man to the demanding Brady, he is also shown to be a dedicated, competent producer who takes his responsibilities very seriously. Mel is constantly at odds with Buddy, who often makes insulting comments about Mel&#x27;s baldness, to which Mel often responds with a simple &quot;Yechh!&quot; 
* Millie Helper (Ann Morgan Guilbert) – Millie is the Petries&#x27; neighbor and Laura&#x27;s best friend from their days in the USO.
* Jerry Helper (Jerry Paris) – Jerry is the Petries&#x27; neighbor, Millie&#x27;s husband, Rob&#x27;s best friend and dentist. He is an avid sailor, audiophile, and electronics and recording enthusiast.
* Alan Brady (Carl Reiner) – Alan is the egocentric, demanding, high maintenance, toupee-wearing star of &quot;The Alan Brady Show&quot;. Originally an unseen character, then shown only with his back to the camera or only in voice, Brady began to make full-face appearances in season four.

Recurring:
* Stacey Petrie (Jerry Van Dyke) – Rob&#x27;s brother, played by Dick Van Dyke&#x27;s real-life brother. Stacey – a quiet, shy, man – is prone to episodes of sleepwalking, during which he becomes, literally, the banjo-playing life of the party, and calls his brother Rob &quot;Burford&quot;. He wrote love letters on behalf of his friend, a drummer named James Garner (not the famous actor) to a girl named Julie. Once Garner lost interest, Stacey continued to write to Julie as Garner because he had fallen in love with her. He confesses the truth, and eventually Julie becomes interested in getting to know him.
* Fiona &quot;Pickles&quot; Conway Sorrell (Barbara Perry/Joan Shawlee) – Buddy&#x27;s slightly nutty wife and former showgirl. Pickles&#x27;s first marriage was to a convicted con man who threatens to tell Buddy she was married to a jailbird unless she bribes him regularly. She becomes an off-screen character after season two.
* Herman Glimscher (Bill Idelson) – Sally&#x27;s occasional and nerdy boyfriend. In the 2004 reunion special, Sally and Herman had been married for years (In an early episode, Sally mentioned having dated a Woodrow Glimscher, presumably a relative, until Woodrow&#x27;s overbearing mother arranged for her to date Herman instead.)
* Sam (or Edward) Petrie – (Will Wright/J. Pat O&#x27;Malley/Tom Tully) – Rob and Stacey&#x27;s father, Laura&#x27;s father-in-law, and Clara&#x27;s husband.
* Clara Petrie – (Carol Veazie/Isabel Randolph) – Rob&#x27;s and Stacey&#x27;s mother, Laura&#x27;s mother-in-law, and Sam&#x27;s wife. Clara doesn&#x27;t like Laura, partly because Laura and Rob married quickly without either set of parents attending the wedding.
* Mr. and Mrs. Alan Meehan – (Carl Benton Reid and Geraldine Wall) are Laura&#x27;s parents.
* Freddie Helper (Peter Oliphant) – Millie and Jerry Helper&#x27;s son and Ritchie&#x27;s best friend.
* Sol/Sam Pomeroy/Pomerantz – Rob&#x27;s army buddy in flashback episodes, was originally played by Marty Ingels. The character&#x27;s names changed over the course of the series. Ingels left the role in 1962 to star in &quot;I&#x27;m Dickens, He&#x27;s Fenster&quot;. In 1963 the character was played by two actors, Allan Melvin and Henry Calvin.
* Delivery boy – there were actually two delivery boys; the first, played by Jamie Farr in four season one episodes, was dubbed &quot;Ptomaine Charlie&quot; by Sally. Subsequently, a second delivery boy was given the name Willie, and Herbie Faye played the role (Faye also played other characters in later episodes).
* Mrs. Billings (Eleanor Audley) – the head of the local Parent-Teacher Association, who shoehorns Rob into writing and directing their annual fundraising shows.

A group of character actors played several different roles during the five seasons. Actors who appeared more than once, sometimes in different roles, included Elvia Allman (as Herman Glimscher&#x27;s mother), Tiny Brauer, Bella Bruck, Jane Dulo, Herbie Faye, Bernard Fox, Dabbs Greer, Jerry Hausner, Peter Hobbs, Jackie Joseph, Sandy Kenyon (who also appeared in the 2004 reunion special), Alvy Moore, Isabel Randolph, Burt Remsen, Johnny Silver, Doris Singleton, Amzie Strickland, George Tyne, Herb Vigran and Len Weinrib. Frank Adamo, who served as Van Dyke&#x27;s personal assistant and stand-in, also played small roles throughout the show&#x27;s five seasons.

==Production==

&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; was filmed before a live audience (one of the few sitcoms at the time to do so) at Desilu-Cahuenga Studios in Hollywood, California, with audience &quot;sweetening&quot; performed in post-production.

Many of the show&#x27;s plots were inspired by Reiner&#x27;s experiences as a writer for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;, both of which starred Sid Caesar. Reiner based the character of Rob Petrie on himself, but Rob&#x27;s egocentric boss Alan Brady is not based on Caesar, but is a combination of the abrasive Milton Berle and Jackie Gleason, according to Reiner.

Johnny Carson was a finalist for the role of Rob Petrie, but Sheldon Leonard selected Van Dyke based on his Broadway performance in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;.

CBS had intended to cancel the show after its first season, but Procter &amp; Gamble threatened to pull its advertising from &quot;the network&#x27;s extremely lucrative daytime lineup&quot; and the show was renewed, keeping its Wednesday night time slot. The show jumped into the top 10 by the third episode of its second season, helped by coming directly after &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, the number one show at the time.

The week of the final broadcast in June 1966, LIFE magazine reported: “The series is not being killed by the network. CBS is drooling to continue this consistent entry in the Nielsen top 20. But the five-year-old show decided to retire. ‘We wanted to quit while we were still proud of it,’ said Van Dyke.”

In 2019 the show&#x27;s archives were donated to the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York.

===Crossovers===
*On October 21, 1963, Morey Amsterdam guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell during the final season of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; on the episode &quot;The Woman Behind the Jokes&quot;.
*Rose Marie and Morey Amsterdam reprised their roles on October 7, 1993, in the &quot;When Hairy Met Hermy&quot; episode of &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot;.
*Carl Reiner reprised the role of Alan Brady on the February 16, 1995, episode of &quot;Mad About You&quot;, a guest appearance that won him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.

==Theme==
The show&#x27;s theme was by Earle Hagen, who also wrote many other TV series themes, including those for &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot;, and &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;.

In a 2004 TVLand Awards appearance, Van Dyke revealed Morey Amsterdam&#x27;s lyrics for the show&#x27;s theme song:

:So you think that you&#x27;ve got trouble?
:Well, trouble&#x27;s a bubble
:So tell old Mr. Trouble to get lost!

:Why not hold your head up high and
:Stop cryin&#x27;, start tryin&#x27;
:And don&#x27;t forget to keep your fingers crossed.

:When you find the joy of livin&#x27;
:Is lovin&#x27; and givin&#x27;
:You&#x27;ll be there when the winning dice are tossed.

:A smile is just a frown that&#x27;s turned upside down
:So smile, and that frown will defrost.

:And don&#x27;t forget to keep your fingers crossed.

==Broadcast history and Nielsen ratings==
==Primetime Emmy Awards==
&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; was nominated for 25 Primetime Emmy Awards and won 15.



==Cast reunions==
* In a special that was first broadcast on April 13, 1969, Van Dyke and Moore reunited for a one-hour variety special called &quot;Dick Van Dyke and the Other Woman.&quot; The program included a never-before-seen alternative take from one of the show&#x27;s episodes in which Rob Petrie breaks down and cries after being dismissed from a film role.
* A 1979 episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Hour&quot; featured Van Dyke and Moore reprising their roles as the Petries in a short sketch presented as the brainstorming of Van Dyke (guest-starring as himself) and the writers of Mary McKinnon&#x27;s (Moore) variety series, who noted McKinnon&#x27;s resemblance to &quot;the gal who played Laura Petrie&quot;.
* In a 1995 episode of the sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;, Carl Reiner reprised the role of Alan Brady, appearing in a documentary by Paul Buchman (Paul Reiser) about the early days of television. The episode included several other references to &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&quot; including the epilogue in which Reiner and Reiser discuss whether it would be funnier to trip over an ottoman or to step over it and sit at the last moment. Brady then notes that &quot;sitting has never been funny&quot;.
* In 2003 TV Land produced &quot;The Alan Brady Show,&quot; an animated special presented as an episode of &quot;Dick Van Dyke&quot;″s show-within-a-show. Reiner, Van Dyke, and Rose Marie contributed voice performances to the show.
* A 2004 reunion special, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited,&quot; brought together the surviving members of the cast. In this continuation, hosted by Ray Romano, Rob and Laura have long since moved to Manhattan, where Laura runs a dance studio. Ritchie has recently bought their old New Rochelle home, widowed neighbor Millie Helper finds a companion in Rob&#x27;s brother Stacey, and Alan Brady re-enters their lives to ask Rob to write his eulogy, with the help of a happily married Sally Rogers Glimscher.

==Home media==
Image Entertainment has released all five seasons of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Season sets were released between October 2003 and June 2004. Also, on May 24, 2005, Image Entertainment repackaged the discs from the individual season sets into a complete series box set. On Blu-ray, the complete series, remastered in high definition, was released on November 13, 2012.

In Region 2, Revelation Films has released the first two seasons on DVD in the UK.

In Region 4, Umbrella Entertainment has released the first three seasons on DVD in Australia.

Following the well-received colorizations of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in the US, two episodes, &quot;That’s My Boy&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast Big Mouth&quot;, were computer colorized by West Wing Studios in 2016 and broadcast by CBS. They were later released on DVD and Blu-ray by CBS Home Entertainment as &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show: Now in Living Color!&quot;

Six episodes of the series, all from the second season, are believed to have lapsed into the public domain and have been released by numerous discount distributors. There also seems to be no original record of copyright for episodes 33–62, which were released in 1962 and 1963. This does not preclude their creators from claiming royalties for them. CBS policy has generally been to claim indirect copyright on such episodes by claiming them as derivative works of earlier episodes that were copyrighted.

==In popular culture==
* In 1999, a Season 6 episode of The X-Files, titled Arcadia, has FBI Agents Mulder and Scully go undercover as a married couple with the names Rob and Laura Petrie.
*In 2003, TV Land produced a pilot for an animated TV series, &quot;The Alan Brady Show&quot;, based on the fictional show-within-a-show on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. Written and executive-produced by Carl Reiner, it was scheduled to air on August 17, 2003, and featured the voices of Rose Marie as &quot;The Secretary&quot; and Dick Van Dyke as &quot;Webb&quot;, with Reiner reprising his role as Alan Brady.
*&quot;Holy Crap&quot;, the second episode of the second season of the animated TV series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, first broadcast on September 30, 1999, features a parody of the opening of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; where Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke) falls over an ottoman. In the parody, Petrie has a series of progressively more serious and dangerous accidents, until someone finally turns the TV off. In &quot;PTV&quot;, the 14th episode of season four, first broadcast on November 6, 2005, the Federal Communications Commission censors the opening credits of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, blacking out both &quot;Dick&quot; and &quot;Dyke&quot;, because of their alternate meanings of &quot;penis&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot;.

* Carl Reiner appears as Alan Brady in the episode &quot;The Alan Brady Show&quot; of the sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;, in which Paul hopes to hire Alan Brady to narrate his documentary about the history of American television.
* The first episode of the Disney+ series &quot;WandaVision&quot; acknowledges the ottoman gag in its opening sequence, with Vision avoiding tripping over a chair in the living room. It was later confirmed in episode 8 that the pilot episode was based on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and the Maximoffs are seen watching the episode &quot;It May Look Like a Walnut.&quot; When the producers of &quot;WandaVision&quot; (Matt Shakman and Kevin Feige) were making the first episode, they consulted Van Dyke for advice about keeping the episode as authentic as possible.

<doc id="157612" wikidata="Q6040" url="?curid=157612" title="Goslar (district)">
<text>Goslar () is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Göttingen, Northeim, Hildesheim and Wolfenbüttel, the city of Salzgitter, and by the states of Saxony-Anhalt (district of Harz) and Thuringia (Nordhausen).

==History==
The history of the district is linked with the city of Goslar. The district of Goslar was established in the 19th century by the Prussian government. The city of Goslar did not belong to the district until 1972, when it was eventually incorporated into the district. Langelsheim merged 1 November 2021 with the three municipalities of the Samtgemeinde Lutter am Barenberge, which was abolished.

==Geography==
The region comprises the northwestern part of the Harz mountains. The Harz National Park is part of this district. The highest peak is the Wurmberg (971 m) near Braunlage, also being the highest elevation of Lower Saxony. Above the small town of Altenau there is the source of the Oker river, which runs through the picturesque Oker valley to leave the Harz at Vienenburg.

==Coat of arms==
The eagle is the heraldic animal of the city of Goslar, while the lion symbolises the municipality of Schladen. Schladen is not part of the district, but the lords of Schladen ruled over major parts of the district in the early Middle Ages.

==Towns and municipalities==
The district of Goslar consists of the following towns and municipalities:

=== Transport ===
; Road
Several federal highways cross the rural district of Goslar. These include the B 4, B 6, B 6n, B 82, B 241, B 242 and B 498.
The district roads (&quot;Kreisstraßen&quot;) are:

; Rail
The territory of the present rural district was joined to the railway network via the Brunswick–Bad Harzburg railway as early as 1840. In 1856 the Brunswick–Kreiensen railway via Seesen was built and, in 1866, the Vienenburg–Goslar railway followed; both branching off the original line. In 1875, the Hildesheim–Goslar railway and the former Halberstadt–Vienenburg railway (to 1945, today it has a new route along the Heudeber-Danstedt–Vienenburg railway) formed part of the link from Hanover via the North Harz to Halle (Saale). Later the lines from Seesen to Herzberg, Seesen to Goslar and Goslar to Bad Harzburg were added.

The railway line via Clausthal-Zellerfeld to Altenau (Innerste Valley Railway) and the railway branches to Braunlage (South Harz Railway) and St. Andreasberg (Oder Valley Railway) have since been dismantled. Even the Derneburg–Seesen branch line is out of service. The former route from Halberstadt via Wasserleben, Vienenburg and Grauhof to Langelsheim served east–west through trains until 1945 but has also since disappeared.

; Scheduled buses
Following the widespread closure of railways in the Harz the schedule bus services have gained great importance.

<doc id="157613" wikidata="Q1547166" url="?curid=157613" title="Under the Pink">
<text>Under the Pink is the second studio album by singer-songwriter Tori Amos. Upon its release in January 1994, the album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart on the back of the hit single &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot;, and peaked at number 12 in the US.

The album was certified double Platinum in the US by the RIAA in October 1999, for sales exceeding 2 million copies. It was the 61st highest-selling album of 1994 in the UK and was certified platinum by the BPI in February 2007, for sales exceeding 300,000 copies.

&quot;Under the Pink&quot; was included in &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;500 CDs You Must Own&quot;, and was voted among the greatest albums of the 1990s by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine some years later. A special double-disc tour edition was released exclusively in Australia and New Zealand in November 1994, titled &quot;More Pink: The B-Sides&quot;.

==Background==
On Tori Amos&#x27; second solo album, the singer-songwriter continued to offer piano-driven rock songs dealing with religion, gender, and sexuality. In addition to featuring more cryptic lyrics and experimental song structures, Amos invited in reggae influences on the single &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot;, prepared piano on &quot;Bells for Her&quot; by John Philip Shenale, and Debussy-inspired piano lines on &quot;Yes, Anastasia&quot;.

Amos performed the &quot;Under the Pink&quot; tour from February through November 1994, encompassing many of the same stops as on the previous world tour. A limited edition release of the album commemorating the Australian tour included a second disc entitled &quot;More Pink&quot;, a collection of rare B-sides like &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; and a cover version of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;A Case of You&quot;, was issued in November 1994. During this period, she also contributed the song &quot;Butterfly&quot; to the soundtrack for the 1994 movie &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, as well as a cover of the R.E.M. song &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;.

The original track listing included the B-side &quot;Honey&quot;, which was left off the album at the last minute. Amos has since voiced great regret for this:
&quot;There were certain songs that were supposed to be on the record that got kicked off. &#x27;Honey&#x27; was supposed to be on the record and, in retrospect, I wish it had been. I kicked it off for &#x27;The Wrong Band&#x27;. &quot;Under the Pink&quot; wept when &#x27;Honey&#x27; wasn&#x27;t on, and she still is angry with me about it.&quot; Amos made a similar reference to the song &quot;Here. In My Head&quot; which was originally featured as a B-side to the UK single of &quot;Crucify&quot;.

The album was recorded in Taos, New Mexico in a hacienda. The album artwork features several Native American and New Mexican references in the photography. The album is also notable as the last Amos album to feature the production of Eric Rosse as they split that year.

==Singles==
&quot;Under the Pink&quot; produced four singles. &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; was released as the first single from the album in Europe and Australia and as the second single in North America. It became Amos&#x27;s biggest international hit at the time, peaking at number four in the UK. &quot;God&quot; was released as the first single in the United States in February 1994, becoming her first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart entry, peaking at number 72. &quot;God&quot; was released as the second single from the album in Australia and as the fourth single in Europe. &quot;Pretty Good Year&quot; was released as the second single in Europe and the fourth single in Australia but was not released as a single in the United States. &quot;Past the Mission&quot;, featuring backing vocals from Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, was the third single from the album in all territories.

==B-sides==
European pressings of the &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; CD single, and the US pressing of the &quot;God&quot; CD single, contained the B-sides &quot;All the Girls Hate Her&quot; and &quot;Over It&quot;. &quot;Sister Janet&quot; appeared on both the European and US pressing of the &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; single, and a B-side of the US cassette single for &quot;God&quot;, while the US CD single of &quot;God&quot; also contained &quot;Home on the Range – Cherokee Edition&quot;. The US &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; CD single, which had different artwork to international pressings, contained a radio edit of the title track, plus the songs &quot;Daisy Dead Petals&quot; and &quot;Honey&quot;. A limited edition second CD single for &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; was issued in the UK, containing cover versions of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;A Case of You&quot;, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot;, and Billie Holiday&#x27;s &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;.

Part one of the UK CD single &quot;Pretty Good Year&quot; contained the B-sides &quot;Home on the Range – Cherokee Edition&quot; and &quot;Daisy Dead Petals&quot;. The latter track was used as a B-side on the US pressing of &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot;. &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Black Swan&quot; appeared as B-sides on part two of the UK &quot;Pretty Good Year&quot; CD single.

Seven live tracks were spread across a two-part CD single release for &quot;Past the Mission&quot; in the UK. Live versions of &quot;Upside Down&quot;, &quot;Past the Mission&quot;, &quot;Icicle&quot; and &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; appeared on the limited edition part one disc, and live versions of &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;The Waitress&quot; and &quot;Here. In My Head&quot; appeared on part two.

The UK release of &quot;God&quot; contained several remixes of the title track.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Under the Pink&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Marie Elsie St. Léger opined that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t match Amos&#x27; riveting, piano-only live performances, but it sure comes close&quot;, calling it an &quot;honest reporting of a life fraught with turmoil and disappointment.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Brad Webber noted &quot;the latent feminism&quot; throughout &quot;Under the Pink&quot; and highlighted Amos&#x27;s &quot;tough veneer&quot; and &quot;genuine&quot; emotion, while &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edna Gundersen said that Amos had made &quot;big strides&quot; with an album that &quot;finds her blasting patriarchy and breaking free of religious repression, victimhood and sexual guilt.&quot; Jean Rosenbluth of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, however, found Amos&#x27;s lyrics &quot;so obtuse—in an overreaching stab at profundity—that they&#x27;re almost meaningless&quot;, a sentiment echoed by John Harris of &quot;NME&quot;, who likened listening to the album to being &quot;locked in a semantic castle&quot;.

Retrospectively, AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett stated that &quot;Under the Pink&quot; &quot;has often been considered a transitional album&quot; and thus tends to be &quot;unfairly neglected when in fact it has as good a claim as any to be one of the strongest, and maybe even the strongest, record she has put out.&quot; Writing for &quot;Record Collector&quot;, Nicola Rayner said that the album, like its 1992 predecessor &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;, explored &quot;weighty subjects in raw, confessional songs that reimagined the piano as a sensual and provocative instrument.&quot; Barry Walters of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; observed that Amos, allowed more creative freedom by her label following the commercial success of &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;, &quot;accentuated the orchestral pomp on some tracks while shrewdly deviating from it on others&quot;, while also noting that &quot;&quot;Pink&quot;″s extroverted arrangements worked as hard as &quot;Earthquakes&quot;″ lyrics and melodies.&quot;

== Reissues ==
A double-disc version of &quot;Under the Pink&quot; was released on November 14, 1994 by East West to coincide with Amos&#x27;s tour of Australia and New Zealand. The second disc, titled &quot;More Pink: The B-Sides&quot; was never released separately, and is a rarity amongst Tori Amos collectibles. Amos would not release another collection of B-sides until 2006&#x27;s &quot;A Piano: The Collection&quot;. The packaging simply inserted the normal Australian release of &quot;Under the Pink&quot; in a double jewel case, and altered the back insert artwork so that instead of being blank it featured the track listing of the second disc as well as production information for the songs. The title &quot;More Pink&quot; may be misleading, as many of the B-sides on the disc did not come from &quot;Under the Pink&quot; singles but in fact from &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;, and in one case, from a Christmas compilation.

The double-disc set entered the Australian ARIA Charts Top 100 Albums chart on the week ending December 11, 1994, peaking at number 44 and spending 6 weeks on the chart. However, it was listed on the chart as a re-entry of &quot;Under the Pink&quot;, with its weeks spent charting added to the 21-week tally achieved earlier by the album.

A 2-disc deluxe edition of the album was released on April 14, 2015 by Rhino Records. This bonus disc included seven b-sides, one remix and seven live performances from the various singles released from the album in 1994. Three b-sides were missing from this release; a cover of &quot;A Case of You&quot; by Joni Mitchell, a cover of &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot; by The Jimi Hendrix Experience and a cover of &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; by Billie Holiday, all of which were exclusively released in the United Kingdom on a limited edition CD single of &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot;.

<text>A composite or composite material (also composition material) is a material which is produced from two or more constituent materials. These constituent materials have notably dissimilar chemical or physical properties and are merged to create a material with properties unlike the individual elements. Within the finished structure, the individual elements remain separate and distinct, distinguishing composites from mixtures and solid solutions. Composite materials with more than one distinct layer are called &quot;composite laminates&quot;.

Typical engineered composite materials are made up of a binding agent forming the &quot;matrix&quot; and a filler material (particulates or fibres) giving &quot;substance&quot;, e.g.:
* Concrete, reinforced concrete and masonry with cement, lime or mortar (which is itself a composite material) as a binder
* Composite wood such as glulam and plywood with wood glue as a binder
* Reinforced plastics, such as fiberglass and fibre-reinforced polymer with resin or thermoplastics as a binder
* Ceramic matrix composites (composite ceramic and metal matrices)
* Metal matrix composites
* advanced composite materials, often first developed for spacecraft and aircraft applications.

Composite materials can be less expensive, lighter, stronger or more durable than common materials. Some are inspired by biological structures found in plants and animals.
Robotic materials are composites that include sensing, actuation, computation, and communication components.

Composite materials are used for construction and technical structures such as boat hulls, swimming pool panels, racing car bodies, shower stalls, bathtubs, storage tanks, imitation granite, and cultured marble sinks and countertops. They are also being increasingly used in general automotive applications.

==History==
The earliest composite materials were made from straw and mud combined to form bricks for building construction. Ancient brick-making was documented by Egyptian tomb paintings.

Wattle and daub might be the oldest composite materials, at over 6000 years old. 

* Woody plants, both true wood from trees and such plants as palms and bamboo, yield natural composites that were used prehistorically by humankind and are still used widely in construction and scaffolding.
* Plywood, 3400 BC, by the Ancient Mesopotamians; gluing wood at different angles gives better properties than natural wood.
* Cartonnage, layers of linen or papyrus soaked in plaster dates to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt c. 2181–2055 BC and was used for death masks.
* Cob mud bricks, or mud walls, (using mud (clay) with straw or gravel as a binder) have been used for thousands of years.
* Concrete was described by Vitruvius, writing around 25 BC in his &quot;Ten Books on Architecture&quot;, distinguished types of aggregate appropriate for the preparation of lime mortars. For &quot;structural mortars&quot;, he recommended &quot;pozzolana&quot;, which were volcanic sands from the sandlike beds of Pozzuoli brownish-yellow-gray in colour near Naples and reddish-brown at Rome. Vitruvius specifies a ratio of 1 part lime to 3 parts pozzolana for cements used in buildings and a 1:2 ratio of lime to pulvis Puteolanus for underwater work, essentially the same ratio mixed today for concrete used at sea. Natural cement-stones, after burning, produced cements used in concretes from post-Roman times into the 20th century, with some properties superior to manufactured Portland cement.
* Papier-mâché, a composite of paper and glue, has been used for hundreds of years.
* The first artificial fibre reinforced plastic was a combination of fiber glass and bakelite, performed in 1935 by Al Simison and Arthur D Little in Owens Corning Company
* One of the most common and familiar composite is fibreglass, in which small glass fibre are embedded within a polymeric material (normally an epoxy or polyester). The glass fibre is relatively strong and stiff (but also brittle), whereas the polymer is ductile (but also weak and flexible). Thus the resulting fibreglass is relatively stiff, strong, flexible, and ductile.
* Composite bow
* Leather cannon, wooden cannon

==Examples==

===Composite materials===

Concrete is the most common artificial composite material of all. , about 7.5 billion cubic metres of concrete are made each year.
Concrete typically consists of loose stones (construction aggregate) held with a matrix of cement. Concrete is an inexpensive material resisting large compressive forces, however, susceptible to tensile loading. To give concrete the ability to resist being stretched, steel bars, which can resist high stretching (tensile) forces, are often added to concrete to form reinforced concrete.

Fibre-reinforced polymers include carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers and glass-reinforced plastic. If classified by matrix then there are thermoplastic composites, short fibre thermoplastics, long fibre thermoplastics or long-fiber-reinforced thermoplastics. There are numerous thermoset composites, including paper composite panels. Many advanced thermoset polymer matrix systems usually incorporate aramid fibre and carbon fibre in an epoxy resin matrix.

Shape-memory polymer composites are high-performance composites, formulated using fibre or fabric reinforcements and shape-memory polymer resin as the matrix. Since a shape-memory polymer resin is used as the matrix, these composites have the ability to be easily manipulated into various configurations when they are heated above their activation temperatures and will exhibit high strength and stiffness at lower temperatures. They can also be reheated and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties. These composites are ideal for applications such as lightweight, rigid, deployable structures; rapid manufacturing; and dynamic reinforcement.

High strain composites are another type of high-performance composites that are designed to perform in a high deformation setting and are often used in deployable systems where structural flexing is advantageous. Although high strain composites exhibit many similarities to shape-memory polymers, their performance is generally dependent on the fibre layout as opposed to the resin content of the matrix.

Composites can also use metal fibres reinforcing other metals, as in metal matrix composites (MMC) or ceramic matrix composites (CMC), which includes bone (hydroxyapatite reinforced with collagen fibres), cermet (ceramic and metal), and concrete. Ceramic matrix composites are built primarily for fracture toughness, not for strength. Another class of composite materials involve woven fabric composite consisting of longitudinal and transverse laced yarns. Woven fabric composites are flexible as they are in form of fabric.

Organic matrix/ceramic aggregate composites include asphalt concrete, polymer concrete, mastic asphalt, mastic roller hybrid, dental composite, syntactic foam, and mother of pearl. Chobham armour is a special type of composite armour used in military applications.

Additionally, thermoplastic composite materials can be formulated with specific metal powders resulting in materials with a density range from 2 g/cm3 to 11 g/cm3 (same density as lead). The most common name for this type of material is &quot;high gravity compound&quot; (HGC), although &quot;lead replacement&quot; is also used. These materials can be used in place of traditional materials such as aluminium, stainless steel, brass, bronze, copper, lead, and even tungsten in weighting, balancing (for example, modifying the centre of gravity of a tennis racquet), vibration damping, and radiation shielding applications. High density composites are an economically viable option when certain materials are deemed hazardous and are banned (such as lead) or when secondary operations costs (such as machining, finishing, or coating) are a factor.

There have been several studies indicating that interleaving stiff and brittle epoxy-based carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer laminates with flexible thermoplastic laminates can help to make highly toughened composites that show improved impact resistance. Another interesting aspect of such interleaved composites is that they are able to have shape memory behaviour without needing any shape-memory polymers or shape-memory alloys e.g. balsa plies interleaved with hot glue, aluminium plies interleaved with acrylic polymers or PVC and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer laminates interleaved with polystyrene.

A sandwich-structured composite is a special class of composite material that is fabricated by attaching two thin but stiff skins to a lightweight but thick core. The core material is normally low strength material, but its higher thickness provides the sandwich composite with high bending stiffness with overall low density.

Wood is a naturally occurring composite comprising cellulose fibres in a lignin and hemicellulose matrix. Engineered wood includes a wide variety of different products such as wood fibre board, plywood, oriented strand board, wood plastic composite (recycled wood fibre in polyethylene matrix), Pykrete (sawdust in ice matrix), plastic-impregnated or laminated paper or textiles, Arborite, Formica (plastic), and Micarta. Other engineered laminate composites, such as Mallite, use a central core of end grain balsa wood, bonded to surface skins of light alloy or GRP. These generate low-weight, high rigidity materials.

Particulate composites have particle as filler material dispersed in matrix, which may be nonmetal, such as glass, epoxy. Automobile tire is an example of particulate composite.

Advanced diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated polymer composites have been reported where the coating increases the surface hydrophobicity, hardness and wear resistance.

Ferromagnetic composites, including those with a polymer matrix consisting, for example, of nanocrystalline filler of Fe-based powders and polymers matrix. Amorphous and nanocrystalline powders obtained, for example, from metallic glasses can be used. Their use makes it possible to obtain ferromagnetic nanocomposites with controlled magnetic properties.

===Products===
Fibre-reinforced composite materials have gained popularity (despite their generally high cost) in high-performance products that need to be lightweight, yet strong enough to take harsh loading conditions such as aerospace components (tails, wings, fuselages, propellers), boat and scull hulls, bicycle frames, and racing car bodies. Other uses include fishing rods, storage tanks, swimming pool panels, and baseball bats. The Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 structures including the wings and fuselage are composed largely of composites. Composite materials are also becoming more common in the realm of orthopedic surgery, and it is the most common hockey stick material.

Carbon composite is a key material in today&#x27;s launch vehicles and heat shields for the re-entry phase of spacecraft. It is widely used in solar panel substrates, antenna reflectors and yokes of spacecraft. It is also used in payload adapters, inter-stage structures and heat shields of launch vehicles. Furthermore, disk brake systems of airplanes and racing cars are using carbon/carbon material, and the composite material with carbon fibres and silicon carbide matrix has been introduced in luxury vehicles and sports cars.

In 2006, a fibre-reinforced composite pool panel was introduced for in-ground swimming pools, residential as well as commercial, as a non-corrosive alternative to galvanized steel.

In 2007, an all-composite military Humvee was introduced by TPI Composites Inc and Armor Holdings Inc, the first all-composite military vehicle. By using composites the vehicle is lighter, allowing higher payloads. In 2008, carbon fibre and DuPont Kevlar (five times stronger than steel) were combined with enhanced thermoset resins to make military transit cases by ECS Composites creating 30-percent lighter cases with high strength.

Pipes and fittings for various purpose like transportation of potable water, fire-fighting, irrigation, seawater, desalinated water, chemical and industrial waste, and sewage are now manufactured in glass reinforced plastics.

Composite materials used in tensile structures for facade application provides the advantage of being translucent. The woven base cloth combined with the appropriate coating allows better light transmission. This provides a very comfortable level of illumination compared to the full brightness of outside.

The wings of wind turbines, in growing sizes in the order of 50 m length are fabricated in composites since several years.

Two-lower-leg-amputees run on carbon-composite spring-like artificial feet as quick as non-amputee athletes.

High-pressure gas cylinders typically about 7–9 litre volume x 300 bar pressure for firemen are nowadays constructed from carbon composite. Type-4-cylinders include metal only as boss that carries the thread to screw in the valve.

On 5 September 2019, HMD Global unveiled the Nokia 6.2 and Nokia 7.2 which are claimed to be using polymer composite for the frames.

==Overview==
Composite materials are created from individual materials. These individual materials are known as constituent materials, and there are two main categories of it. One is the matrix (binder) and the other reinforcement. A portion of each kind is needed at least. The reinforcement receives support from the matrix as the matrix surrounds the reinforcement and maintains its relative positions. The properties of the matrix are improved as the reinforcements impart their exceptional physical and mechanical properties. The mechanical properties become unavailable from the individual constituent materials by synergism. At the same time, the designer of the product or structure receives options to choose an optimum combination from the variety of matrix and strengthening materials.

To shape the engineered composites, it must be formed. The reinforcement is placed onto the mould surface or into the mould cavity. Before or after this, the matrix can be introduced to the reinforcement. The matrix undergoes a melding event which sets the part shape necessarily. This melding event can happen in several ways, depending upon the matrix nature, such as solidification from the melted state for a thermoplastic polymer matrix composite or chemical polymerization for a thermoset polymer matrix.

According to the requirements of end-item design, various methods of moulding can be used. The natures of the chosen matrix and reinforcement are the key factors influencing the methodology. The gross quantity of material to be made is another main factor. To support high capital investments for rapid and automated manufacturing technology, vast quantities can be used. Cheaper capital investments but higher labour and tooling expenses at a correspondingly slower rate assists the small production quantities.

Many commercially produced composites use a polymer matrix material often called a resin solution. There are many different polymers available depending upon the starting raw ingredients. There are several broad categories, each with numerous variations. The most common are known as polyester, vinyl ester, epoxy, phenolic, polyimide, polyamide, polypropylene, PEEK, and others. The reinforcement materials are often fibres but also commonly ground minerals. The various methods described below have been developed to reduce the resin content of the final product, or the fibre content is increased. As a rule of thumb, lay up results in a product containing 60% resin and 40% fibre, whereas vacuum infusion gives a final product with 40% resin and 60% fibre content. The strength of the product is greatly dependent on this ratio.

Martin Hubbe and Lucian A Lucia consider wood to be a natural composite of cellulose fibres in a matrix of lignin.

==Cores in composites==
Several layup designs of composite also involve a co-curing or post-curing of the prepreg with many other media, such as foam or honeycomb. Generally, this is known as a sandwich structure. This is a more general layup for the production of cowlings, doors, radomes or non-structural parts.

Open- and closed-cell-structured foams like polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, polyethylene, or polystyrene foams, balsa wood, syntactic foams, and honeycombs are generally utilized core materials. Open- and closed-cell metal foam can also be utilized as core materials. Recently, 3D graphene structures ( also called graphene foam) have also been employed as core structures. A recent review by Khurram and Xu et al., have provided the summary of the state-of-the-art techniques for fabrication of the 3D structure of graphene, and the examples of the use of these foam like structures as a core for their respective polymer composites.

===Semi-crystalline polymers===
Although the two phases are chemically equivalent, semi-crystalline polymers can be described both quantitatively and qualitatively as composite materials. The crystalline portion has a higher elastic modulus and provides reinforcement for the less stiff, amorphous phase. Polymeric materials can range from 0% to 100% crystallinity aka volume fraction depending on molecular structure and thermal history. Different processing techniques can be employed to vary the percent crystallinity in these materials and thus the mechanical properties of these materials as described in the physical properties section. This effect is seen in a variety of places from industrial plastics like polyethylene shopping bags to spiders which can produce silks with different mechanical properties. In many cases these materials act like particle composites with randomly dispersed crystals known as spherulites. However they can also be engineered to be anisotropic and act more like fiber reinforced composites. In the case of spider silk, the properties of the material can even be dependent on the size of the crystals, independent of the volume fraction. Ironically, single component polymeric materials are some of the most easily tunable composite materials known.

==Methods of fabrication==
Normally, the fabrication of composite includes wetting, mixing or saturating the reinforcement with the matrix. The matrix is then induced to bind together (with heat or a chemical reaction) into a rigid structure. Usually, the operation is done in an open or closed forming mould. However, the order and ways of introducing the constituents alters considerably. Composites fabrication is achieved by a wide variety of methods, including advanced fibre placement (automated fibre placement), fibreglass spray lay-up process, filament winding, lanxide process, tailored fibre placement, tufting, and z-pinning.

===Overview of mould===
The reinforcing and matrix materials are merged, compacted, and cured (processed) within a mould to undergo a melding event. The part shape is fundamentally set after the melding event. However, under particular process conditions, it can deform. The melding event for a thermoset polymer matrix material is a curing reaction that is caused by the possibility of extra heat or chemical reactivity such as an organic peroxide. The melding event for a thermoplastic polymeric matrix material is a solidification from the melted state. The melding event for a metal matrix material such as titanium foil is a fusing at high pressure and a temperature near the melting point.

It is suitable for many moulding methods to refer to one mould piece as a &quot;lower&quot; mould and another mould piece as an &quot;upper&quot; mould. Lower and upper does not refer to the mould&#x27;s configuration in space, but the different faces of the moulded panel. There is always a lower mould, and sometimes an upper mould in this convention. Part construction commences by applying materials to the lower mould. Lower mould and upper mould are more generalized descriptors than more common and specific terms such as male side, female side, a-side, b-side, tool side, bowl, hat, mandrel, etc. Continuous manufacturing utilizes a different nomenclature.

Usually, the moulded product is referred to as a panel. It can be referred to as casting for certain geometries and material combinations. It can be referred to as a profile for certain continuous processes. Some of the processes are autoclave moulding, vacuum bag moulding, pressure bag moulding, resin transfer moulding, and light resin transfer moulding.

===Other fabrication methods===
Other types of fabrication include casting, centrifugal casting, braiding (onto a former), continuous casting, filament winding, press moulding, transfer moulding, pultrusion moulding, and slip forming. There are also forming capabilities including CNC filament winding, vacuum infusion, wet lay-up, compression moulding, and thermoplastic moulding, to name a few. The practice of curing ovens and paint booths is also required for some projects.

====Finishing methods====
The composite parts finishing is also crucial in the final design. Many of these finishes will involve rain-erosion coatings or polyurethane coatings.

===Tooling===
The mould and mould inserts are referred to as &quot;tooling&quot;. The mould/tooling can be built from different materials. Tooling materials include aluminium, carbon fibre, invar, nickel, reinforced silicone rubber and steel. The tooling material selection is normally based on, but not limited to, the coefficient of thermal expansion, expected number of cycles, end item tolerance, desired or expected surface condition, cure method, glass transition temperature of the material being moulded, moulding method, matrix, cost, and other various considerations.

==Physical properties==

Usually, the composite&#x27;s physical properties are not isotropic (independent of the direction of applied force) in nature. But they are typically anisotropic (different depending on the direction of the applied force or load). For instance, the composite panel&#x27;s stiffness will usually depend upon the orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The composite&#x27;s strength is bounded by two loading conditions, as shown in the plot to the right.

===Isostrain rule of mixtures===
If both the fibres and matrix are aligned parallel to the loading direction, the deformation of both phases will be the same (assuming there is no delamination at the fibre-matrix interface). This isostrain condition provides the upper bound for composite strength, and is determined by the rule of mixtures:

:formula_1

where &quot;EC&quot; is the effective composite Young&#x27;s modulus, and &quot;Vi&quot; and &quot;Ei&quot; are the volume fraction and Young&#x27;s moduli, respectively, of the composite phases.

For example, a composite material made up of α and β phases as shown in the figure to the right under isostrain, the Young&#x27;s modulus would be as follows:formula_2where Vα and Vβ are the respective volume fractions of each phase.
This can be derived by considering that in the isostrain case,formula_3 Assuming that the composite has a uniform cross section, the stress on the composite is a weighted average between the two phases,formula_4 The stresses in the individual phases are given by Hooke&#x27;s Law,formula_5formula_6 Combining these equations gives that the overall stress in the composite isformula_7 Then it can be shown thatformula_8

===Isostress rule of mixtures===
The lower bound is dictated by the isostress condition, in which the fibres and matrix are oriented perpendicularly to the loading direction:formula_9and now the strains become a weighted averageformula_10Rewriting Hooke&#x27;s Law for the individual phasesformula_11formula_12 This leads toformula_13From the definition of Hooke&#x27;s Lawformula_14and, in general,
:formula_15

Following the example above, if one had a composite material made up of α and β phases under isostress conditions as shown in the figure to the right, the composition Young&#x27;s modulus would be:formula_16 The isostrain condition implies that under an applied load, both phases experience the same strain but will feel different stress. Comparatively, under isostress conditions both phases will feel the same stress but the strains will differ between each phase. A generalized equation for any loading condition between isostrain and isostress can be written as:
:formula_17

where X is a material property such as modulus or stress, c, m, and r stand for the properties of the composite, matrix, and reinforcement materials respectively, and n is a value between 1 and −1.

The above equation can be further generalized beyond a two phase composite to an m-component system:
:formula_18

Though composite stiffness is maximized when fibres are aligned with the loading direction, so is the possibility of fibre tensile fracture, assuming the tensile strength exceeds that of the matrix. When a fibre has some angle of misorientation θ, several fracture modes are possible. For small values of θ the stress required to initiate fracture is increased by a factor of (cos θ)−2 due to the increased cross-sectional area (&quot;A&quot; cos θ) of the fibre and reduced force (&quot;F/&quot;cos θ) experienced by the fibre, leading to a composite tensile strength of &quot;σparallel /&quot;cos2 θ where &quot;σparallel &quot; is the tensile strength of the composite with fibres aligned parallel with the applied force.

Intermediate angles of misorientation θ lead to matrix shear failure. Again the cross sectional area is modified but since shear stress is now the driving force for failure the area of the matrix parallel to the fibres is of interest, increasing by a factor of 1/sin θ. Similarly, the force parallel to this area again decreases (&quot;F/&quot;cos θ) leading to a total tensile strength of &quot;τmy /&quot;sin θ cos θ where &quot;τmy&quot; is the matrix shear strength.

Finally, for large values of θ (near π/2) transverse matrix failure is the most likely to occur, since the fibres no longer carry the majority of the load. Still, the tensile strength will be greater than for the purely perpendicular orientation, since the force perpendicular to the fibres will decrease by a factor of 1/sin θ and the area decreases by a factor of 1/sin θ producing a composite tensile strength of &quot;σperp /&quot;sin2θ where &quot;σperp &quot; is the tensile strength of the composite with fibres align perpendicular to the applied force.

The majority of commercial composites are formed with random dispersion and orientation of the strengthening fibres, in which case the composite Young&#x27;s modulus will fall between the isostrain and isostress bounds. However, in applications where the strength-to-weight ratio is engineered to be as high as possible (such as in the aerospace industry), fibre alignment may be tightly controlled.

Panel stiffness is also dependent on the design of the panel. For instance, the fibre reinforcement and matrix used, the method of panel build, thermoset versus thermoplastic, and type of weave.

In contrast to composites, isotropic materials (for example, aluminium or steel), in standard wrought forms, possess the same stiffness typically despite the directional orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures for an isotropic material can be described with the following material properties: Young&#x27;s Modulus, the shear modulus, and the Poisson&#x27;s ratio, in relatively simple mathematical relationships. For the anisotropic material, it needs the mathematics of a second-order tensor and up to 21 material property constants. For the special case of orthogonal isotropy, there are three distinct material property constants for each of Young&#x27;s Modulus, Shear Modulus and Poisson&#x27;s ratio—a total of 9 constants to express the relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures.

Techniques that take benefit of the materials&#x27; anisotropic properties involve mortise and tenon joints (in natural composites such as wood) and pi joints in synthetic composites.

==Mechanical properties of composites==

===Particle reinforcement===
In general, particle reinforcement is strengthening the composites less than fiber reinforcement. It is used to enhance the stiffness of the composites while increasing the strength and the toughness. Because of their mechanical properties, they are used in applications in which wear resistance is required. For example, hardness of cement can be increased by reinforcing gravel particles, drastically. Particle reinforcement a highly advantageous method of tuning mechanical properties of materials since it is very easy implement while being low cost.

The elastic modulus of particle-reinforced composites can be expressed as,
:formula_19

where E is the elastic modulus, V is the volume fraction. The subscripts c, p and m are indicating composite, particle and matrix, respectively. formula_20 is a constant can be found empirically.

Similarly, tensile strength of particle-reinforced composites can be expressed as,
:formula_21

where T.S. is the tensile strength, and formula_22 is a constant (not equal to formula_20) that can be found empirically.

===Continuous fiber reinforcement===
In general, continuous fiber reinforcement is implemented by incorporating a fiber as the strong phase into a weak phase, matrix. The reason for the popularity of fiber usage is materials with extraordinary strength can be obtained in their fiber form. Non-metallic fibers are usually showing a very high strength to density ratio compared to metal fibers because of the covalent nature of their bonds. The most famous example of this is carbon fibers that have many applications extending from sports gear to protective equipment to space industries.

The stress on the composite can be expressed in terms of the volume fraction of the fiber and the matrix.
:formula_24

where formula_25 is the stress, V is the volume fraction. The subscripts c, f and m are indicating composite, fiber and matrix, respectively.

Although the stress–strain behavior of fiber composites can only be determined by testing, there is an expected trend, three stages of the stress–strain curve. The first stage is the region of the stress–strain curve where both fiber and the matrix are elastically deformed. This linearly elastic region can be expressed in the following form.
:formula_26

where formula_25 is the stress, formula_28 is the strain, E is the elastic modulus, and V is the volume fraction. The subscripts c, f, and m are indicating composite, fiber, and matrix, respectively.

After passing the elastic region for both fiber and the matrix, the second region of the stress–strain curve can be observed. In the second region, the fiber is still elastically deformed while the matrix is plastically deformed since the matrix is the weak phase. The instantaneous modulus can be determined using the slope of the stress–strain curve in the second region. The relationship between stress and strain can be expressed as,
:formula_29

where formula_25 is the stress, formula_28 is the strain, E is the elastic modulus, and V is the volume fraction. The subscripts c, f, and m are indicating composite, fiber, and matrix, respectively. To find the modulus in the second region derivative of this equation can be used since the slope of the curve is equal to the modulus.
:formula_32

In most cases it can be assumedformula_33 since the second term is much less than the first one.

In reality, the derivative of stress with respect to strain is not always returning the modulus because of the binding interaction between the fiber and matrix. The strength of the interaction between these two phases can result in changes in the mechanical properties of the composite. The compatibility of the fiber and matrix is a measure of internal stress.

The covalently bonded high strength fibers (e.g. carbon fibers) experience mostly elastic deformation before the fracture since the plastic deformation can happen due to dislocation motion. Whereas, metallic fibers have more space to plastically deform, so their composites exhibit a third stage where both fiber and the matrix are plastically deforming. Metallic fibers have many applications to work at cryogenic temperatures that is one of the advantages of composites with metal fibers over nonmetallic. The stress in this region of the stress–strain curve can be expressed as,
:formula_34

where formula_25 is the stress, formula_28 is the strain, E is the elastic modulus, and V is the volume fraction. The subscripts c, f, and m are indicating composite, fiber, and matrix, respectively. formula_37 and formula_38 are for fiber and matrix flow stresses respectively. Just after the third region the composite exhibit necking. The necking strain of composite is happened to be between the necking strain of the fiber and the matrix just like other mechanical properties of the composites. The necking strain of the weak phase is delayed by the strong phase. The amount of the delay depends upon the volume fraction of the strong phase.

Thus, the tensile strength of the composite can be expressed in terms of the volume fraction.
:formula_39

where T.S. is the tensile strength, formula_25 is the stress, formula_28 is the strain, E is the elastic modulus, and V is the volume fraction. The subscripts c, f, and m are indicating composite, fiber, and matrix, respectively. The composite tensile strength can be expressed as
:formula_42 for formula_43 is less than or equal to formula_44 (arbitrary critical value of volume fraction)
:formula_45 for formula_43 is greater than or equal to formula_44

The critical value of volume fraction can be expressed as,
:formula_48

Evidently, the composite tensile strength can be higher than the matrix if formula_49 is greater than formula_50.

Thus, the minimum volume fraction of the fiber can be expressed as,
:formula_51

Although this minimum value is very low in practice, it is very important to know since the reason for the incorporation of continuous fibers is to improve the mechanical properties of the materials/composites, and this value of volume fraction is the threshold of this improvement.

===The effect of fiber orientation===

====Aligned fibers====
A change in the angle between the applied stress and fiber orientation will affect the mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced composites, especially the tensile strength. This angle, formula_52, can be used predict the dominant tensile fracture mechanism.

At small angles, formula_53, the dominant fracture mechanism is the same as with load-fiber alignment, tensile fracture. The resolved force acting upon the length of the fibers is reduced by a factor of formula_54 from rotation. formula_55. The resolved area on which the fiber experiences the force is increased by a factor of formula_54 from rotation. formula_57. Taking the effective tensile strength to be formula_58 and the aligned tensile strength formula_59.
:formula_60

At moderate angles, formula_61, the material experiences shear failure. The effective force direction is reduced with respect to the aligned direction. formula_55. The resolved area on which the force acts is formula_63. The resulting tensile strength depends on the shear strength of the matrix, formula_64.
:formula_65

At extreme angles, formula_66, the dominant mode of failure is tensile fracture in the matrix in the perpendicular direction. As in the isostress case of layered composite materials, the strength in this direction is lower than in the aligned direction. The effective areas and forces act perpendicular to the aligned direction so they both scale by formula_67. The resolved tensile strength is proportional to the transverse strength, formula_68.
:formula_69

The critical angles from which the dominant fracture mechanism changes can be calculated as,
:formula_70
:formula_71

where formula_72 is the critical angle between longitudinal fracture and shear failure, and formula_73 is the critical angle between shear failure and transverse fracture.

By ignoring length effects, this model is most accurate for continuous fibers and does not effectively capture the strength-orientation relationship for short fiber reinforced composites. Furthermore, most realistic systems do not experience the local maxima predicted at the critical angles. The Tsai-Hill criterion provides a more complete description of fiber composite tensile strength as a function of orientation angle by coupling the contributing yield stresses: formula_74, formula_75, and formula_64.
:formula_77

====Randomly oriented fibers====
Anisotropy in the tensile strength of fiber reinforced composites can be removed by randomly orienting the fiber directions within the material. It sacrifices the ultimate strength in the aligned direction for an overall, isotropically strengthened material.
:formula_78

Where K is an empirically determined reinforcement factor; similar to the particle reinforcement equation. For fibers with randomly distributed orientations in a plane, formula_79, and for a random distribution in 3D, formula_80.

=== Stiffness and Compliance Elasticity ===
For real application, most composite is anisotropic material or orthotropic material. The three-dimension stress tensor is required for stress and strain analysis. The stiffness and compliance can be written as follows

formula_81 and formula_82

In order to simplify the 3D stress direction, the plane stress assumption is apply that the out–of–plane stress and out–of–plane strain are insignificant or zero. That is formula_83 and formula_84.

formula_85

The stiffness matrix and compliance matrix can be reduced to

formula_86 and formula_87

For fiber-reinforced composite, the fiber orientation in material affect anisotropic properties of the structure. From characterizing technique i.e. tensile testing, the material properties were measured based on sample (1-2) coordinate system. The tensors above express stress-strain relationship in (1-2) coordinate system. While the known material properties is in the principal coordinate system (x-y) of material. Transforming the tensor between two coordinate system help identify the material properties of the tested sample. The transformation matrix with formula_88 degree rotation is 

formula_89 for formula_90formula_91 for formula_92

===Types of fibers and mechanical properties===
The most common types of fibers used in industry are glass fibers, carbon fibers, and kevlar due to their ease of production and availability. Their mechanical properties are very important to know, therefore the table of their mechanical properties is given below to compare them with S97 steel. The angle of fiber orientation is very important because of the anisotropy of fiber composites (please see the section &quot;Physical properties&quot; for a more detailed explanation). The mechanical properties of the composites can be tested using standard mechanical testing methods by positioning the samples at various angles (the standard angles are 0°, 45°, and 90°) with respect to the orientation of fibers within the composites. In general, 0° axial alignment makes composites resistant to longitudinal bending and axial tension/compression, 90° hoop alignment is used to obtain resistance to internal/external pressure, and ± 45° is the ideal choice to obtain resistance against pure torsion.

==== Carbon fiber &amp; fiberglass composites vs. aluminum alloy and steel ====

Although strength and stiffness of steel and aluminum alloys are comparable to fiber composites, specific strength and stiffness of composites (i.e. in relation to their weight) are significantly higher.

===Failure===
Shock, impact of varying speed, or repeated cyclic stresses can provoke the laminate to separate at the interface between two layers, a condition known as delamination. Individual fibres can separate from the matrix, for example, fibre pull-out.

Composites can fail on the macroscopic or microscopic scale. Compression failures can happen at both the macro scale or at each individual reinforcing fibre in compression buckling. Tension failures can be net section failures of the part or degradation of the composite at a microscopic scale where one or more of the layers in the composite fail in tension of the matrix or failure of the bond between the matrix and fibres.

Some composites are brittle and possess little reserve strength beyond the initial onset of failure while others may have large deformations and have reserve energy absorbing capacity past the onset of damage. The distinctions in fibres and matrices that are available and the mixtures that can be made with blends leave a very broad range of properties that can be designed into a composite structure. The most famous failure of a brittle ceramic matrix composite occurred when the carbon-carbon composite tile on the leading edge of the wing of the Space Shuttle Columbia fractured when impacted during take-off. It directed to the catastrophic break-up of the vehicle when it re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 1 February 2003.

Composites have relatively poor bearing strength compared to metals.

===Testing===
Composites are tested before and after construction to assist in predicting and preventing failures. Pre-construction testing may adopt finite element analysis (FEA) for ply-by-ply analysis of curved surfaces and predicting wrinkling, crimping and dimpling of composites. Materials may be tested during manufacturing and after construction by various non-destructive methods including ultrasonic, thermography, shearography and X-ray radiography, and laser bond inspection for NDT of relative bond strength integrity in a localized area.

<text>Goslar (; Eastphalian: &quot;Goslär&quot;) is a historic town in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the administrative centre of the district of Goslar and is located on the northwestern of the Harz mountain range. The Old Town of Goslar with over 1.500 timber houses and the Mines of Rammelsberg are UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their millennium-long testimony to the history of ore mining and their political importance for the Holy Roman Empire and Hanseatic League. Each year Goslar awards the Kaiserring to an international artist, called the &quot;Nobel Prize&quot; of the art world.

==Geography==

Goslar is situated in the middle of the upper half of Germany, about south of Brunswick and about southeast of the state capital, Hanover. The Schalke mountain is the highest elevation within the municipal boundaries at . The lowest point of is near the Oker river. Geographically, Goslar forms the boundary between the Hildesheim Börde which is part of the Northern German Plain, and the Harz range, which is the highest, northernmost extension of Germany&#x27;s Central Uplands. The Hildesheim Börde is characterised by plains with rich clay soils – used agriculturally for sugar beet farming – interlaced with several hill ranges commonly known as the Hildesheim Forest and Salzgitter Hills. In the northeast the Harly Forest stretches down to the River Oker, in the east, Goslar borders on the German state of Saxony-Anhalt.

Immediately to the south the Harz range rises above the historic borough at a height of at Mt Rammelsberg. Extended forests dominate the landscape. The major rivers crossing the municipal boundaries are the Oker with its Gose/Abzucht and Radau tributaries. The eponymic River Gose originates approximately south-west of Goslar at the Auerhahn Pass () east of the Bocksberg mountain. At the northern foot of the Herzberg () it meets the smaller Abzucht before it flows into the Oker. The Dörpke and Gelmke also flow from the Harz foothills to the south into the Goslar municipal area, where they discharge into the Abzucht.

==History==

Iron ore mining has been common in the Harz region since Roman times; the earliest known evidence for quarrying and smelting is from the 3rd century AD. Ancient burial objects made of Harz ore have even been discovered during excavations in England. The settlement on the Gose creek was first mentioned in a 979 deed issued by Emperor Otto II; it was located in the Saxon homelands of the Ottonian dynasty and probably a royal palace () already existed at the site. It became even more important when extensive silver deposits were discovered at the nearby Rammelsberg, today a mining museum. The name&#x27;s toponymy probably comes shortened from &quot;Goselager&quot;, of the stream &quot;Gose&quot; on the northern edge of the Harz Mountains, and Lager.

When Otto&#x27;s descendant Henry II began to convene Imperial synods at the Goslar palace in 1009, Goslar gradually replaced the Royal palace of Werla as a central place of assembly in the Saxon lands, a development that was again enforced by the Salian (Franconian) emperors. Conrad II, once elected King of the Romans, celebrated Christmas 1024 in Goslar and had the foundations laid for the new Imperial Palace () the next year.

Goslar became the favourite residence of Conrad&#x27;s son Henry III, who stayed at the palace about twenty times. Here he received King Peter of Hungary as well as the emissaries of Prince Yaroslav of Kiev and here he appointed bishops and dukes. His son and successor Henry IV was born here on 11 November 1050. Henry also had Goslar Cathedral erected and consecrated by Archbishop Herman of Cologne in 1051. Shortly before his death in 1056 Emperor Henry III met Pope Victor II in the church, emphasizing the union of secular and ecclesiastical power. His heart was buried in Goslar, his body in the Salian family vault in Speyer Cathedral. Of the cathedral only the northern porch survived; the main building was torn down in the early 19th century.

Under Henry IV Goslar remained a centre of Imperial rule. However conflicts intensified such as in the violent Precedence Dispute at Pentecost 1063. While Henry aimed at securing the enormous wealth deriving from the Rammlesberg silver mines as a royal demesne, the dissatisfaction of local nobles escalated with the Saxon revolt 1073–1075. In the subsequent Saxon revolt of 1077–1088 the Goslar citizens sided with anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden, who held a princely assembly here in 1077, and with Hermann of Salm, who was crowned king in Goslar by Archbishop Siegfried of Mainz on 26 December 1081, giving Goslar the status of an Imperial City.

In Spring 1105 Henry V convened the Saxon estates at Goslar to gain support for the deposition of his father, Henry IV. Elected king in the following year, he held six Imperial Diets at the Goslar Palace during his rule. The tradition was adopted by his successor Lothair II and even by the Hohenstaufen rulers Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa. After his election in 1152, King Frederick appointed the Welf duke Henry the Lion Imperial &quot;Vogt&quot; (bailiff) of the Goslar mines; nevertheless, the dissatisfied duke besieged the town and at an 1173 meeting in Chiavenna demanded his enfeoffment with the estates in turn for his support on Barbarossa&#x27;s Italian campaigns. When Henry the Lion was finally declared deposed in 1180, he had the Rammelsberg mines devastated.

Goslar&#x27;s importance as an Imperial residence began to decline under the rule of Barbarossa&#x27;s descendants. During the German throne dispute the Welf king Otto IV laid siege to the town in 1198 but had to yield to the forces of his Hohenstaufen rival Philip of Swabia. Goslar was again stormed and plundered by Otto&#x27;s troops in 1206. Frederick II held the last Imperial Diet here; with the Great Interregnum upon his death in 1250, Goslar&#x27;s Imperial era ended.

While the Emperors withdraw from Northern Germany, civil liberties in Goslar were strengthened. Market rights date back to 1025 and a municipal council () was first mentioned in 1219. The citizens strove for control of the Rammelsberg silver mines and in 1267 joined the Hanseatic League. Besides mining in the Upper Harz, commerce and trade in Gose beer, later also slate and vitriol, became important. By 1290 the council had obtained rights, confirming Goslar&#x27;s status as a free imperial city. In 1340 its citizens were vested with rights by Emperor Louis the Bavarian. The Goslar town law set an example for numerous other municipalities, like the Goslar mining law codified in 1359.

Early modern times saw both a mining boom and rising conflicts with the Welf Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, mainly with Prince Henry V of Wolfenbüttel who seized the Rammelsberg mines and extended Harz forests in 1527. Though a complaint was successfully lodged with the by the Goslar citizens, a subsequent gruelling feud with the duke lasted for decades. Goslar was temporarily placed under Imperial ban, while the Protestant Reformation was introduced in the city by theologian Nicolaus von Amsdorf who issued a first church constitution in 1531. To assert independence, the citizens in 1536 joined the Schmalkaldic League against the Catholic policies of the Habsburg emperor Charles V. The Schmalkaldic forces indeed occupied the Wolfenbüttel lands of Henry V, however, when they were defeated by Imperial forces at the 1547 Battle of Mühlberg, the Welf duke continued his reprisals.

In 1577 the Goslar citizens signed the Lutheran Formula of Concord. After years of continued skirmishes, they finally had to grant Duke Henry and his son Julius extensive mining rights which ultimately edged out the city council. Nevertheless, several attempts by the Brunswick dukes to incorporate the Imperial city were rejected. Goslar and its economy was hit hard by the Thirty Years&#x27; War, mainly by the financial crisis in the 1620s which led to several revolts and pogroms. Facing renewed aggressions by Duke Christian the Younger of Brunswick, the citizens sought support from the Imperial military leaders Tilly and . The city was occupied by the Swedish forces of King Gustavus Adolphus from 1632 to 1635; in 1642 a peace agreement was reached between Emperor Ferdinand III and the Brunswick duke Augustus the Younger. The hopes of the Goslar citizens to regain the Rammelsberg mines were not fulfilled.

Goslar remained loyal to the Imperial authority, solemnly celebrating each accession of a Holy Roman Emperor. While strongly referring to its great medieval traditions, the city continuously decreased in importance and got into rising indebtedness. When stayed at Goslar in 1777, he called it &quot;an Imperial city rotted in and with its privileges&quot;. 
In the winter of 1798, the coldest of the century, the young English poet William Wordsworth stayed in the city. To dispel homesickness he started to write a few verses about his childhood, which would eventually evolve into the masterpiece that was published in 13 volumes after his death as &quot;The Prelude&quot;.

First administrative reforms were enacted by councillors of the Siemens family. Nevertheless, the status of Imperial immediacy was finally lost, when Goslar was annexed by Prussian forces during the Napoleonic Wars in 1802, confirmed by the German Mediatisation the next year. Under Prussian rule, further reforms were pushed ahead by councillor Christian Wilhelm von Dohm. Temporarily part of the Kingdom of Westphalia upon the Prussian defeat at the 1806 Battle of Jena–Auerstedt, Goslar finally was assigned to the newly established Kingdom of Hanover by resolution of the Vienna Congress. The cathedral was sold and torn down from 1820 to 1822, bitterly mourned by Heinrich Heine in his travelogue. Again under Prussian rule after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Goslar became a popular retirement residence (&quot;Pensionopolis&quot;) and a garrison town of the Prussian Army. The Hohenzollern kings and emperors had the Imperial Palace restored, including the mural paintings by Hermann Wislicenus.

After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 Reichsminister Richard Walther Darré made Goslar the seat of the agricultural corporation. In 1936 the city obtained the title of . In the course of German rearmament a airbase was built north of the town and several war supplier companies located in the vicinity, including subcamps of the Buchenwald and Neuengamme concentration camps. Nevertheless the historic town escaped strategic bombing during World War II.

Part of the British occupation zone from 1945, Goslar was the site of a displaced persons’ camp. During the Cold War era the city near the inner German border was a major garrison town for the West German army and the border police. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 the barracks were vacated and a major economic factor was lost. The Rammelberg mines were finally closed in 1988 after more than a thousand years.

In the summer of 2018 a bottled typewritten message dated 26 March 1930 was discovered in the roof of Goslar Cathedral, signed by four roofers, who bemoaned the economic state of the country. The bottle was discovered by a roofer who turned out to be the grandson of one of the signatories, who had been an 18-year-old apprentice in 1930. Goslar&#x27;s mayor replaced the bottle with a copy of the 1930 message, adding his own confidential message.

<text>In electrochemistry, the electrochemical potential (ECP), &quot;&quot;, is a thermodynamic measure of chemical potential that does not omit the energy contribution of electrostatics. Electrochemical potential is expressed in the unit of J/mol.

==Introduction==
Each chemical species (for example, &quot;water molecules&quot;, &quot;sodium ions&quot;, &quot;electrons&quot;, etc.) has an electrochemical potential (a quantity with units of energy) at any given point in space, which represents how easy or difficult it is to add more of that species to that location. If possible, a species will move from areas with higher electrochemical potential to areas with lower electrochemical potential; in equilibrium, the electrochemical potential will be constant everywhere for each species (it may have a different value for different species). For example, if a glass of water has sodium ions (Na+) dissolved uniformly in it, and an electric field is applied across the water, then the sodium ions will tend to get pulled by the electric field towards one side. We say the ions have electric potential energy, and are moving to lower their potential energy. Likewise, if a glass of water has a lot of dissolved sugar on one side and none on the other side, each sugar molecule will randomly diffuse around the water, until there is equal concentration of sugar everywhere. We say that the sugar molecules have a &quot;chemical potential&quot;, which is higher in the high-concentration areas, and the molecules move to lower their chemical potential. These two examples show that an electrical potential and a chemical potential can both give the same result: A redistribution of the chemical species. Therefore, it makes sense to combine them into a single &quot;potential&quot;, the &quot;electrochemical potential&quot;, which can directly give the &quot;net&quot; redistribution taking &quot;both&quot; into account.

It is (in principle) easy to measure whether or not two regions (for example, two glasses of water) have the same electrochemical potential for a certain chemical species (for example, a solute molecule): Allow the species to freely move back and forth between the two regions (for example, connect them with a semi-permeable membrane that lets only that species through). If the chemical potential is the same in the two regions, the species will occasionally move back and forth between the two regions, but on average there is just as much movement in one direction as the other, and there is zero net migration (this is called &quot;diffusive equilibrium&quot;). If the chemical potentials of the two regions are different, more molecules will move to the lower chemical potential than the other direction.

Moreover, when there is &quot;not&quot; diffusive equilibrium, i.e., when there is a tendency for molecules to diffuse from one region to another, then there is a certain free energy released by each net-diffusing molecule. This energy, which can sometimes be harnessed (a simple example is a concentration cell), and the free-energy per mole is exactly equal to the electrochemical potential difference between the two regions.

== Conflicting terminologies ==
It is common in electrochemistry and solid-state physics to discuss both the chemical potential and the electrochemical potential of the electrons. However, in the two fields, the definitions of these two terms are sometimes swapped. In electrochemistry, the &quot;electrochemical potential&quot; of electrons (or any other species) is the total potential, including both the (internal, nonelectrical) chemical potential and the electric potential, and is by definition constant across a device in equilibrium, whereas the &quot;chemical potential&quot; of electrons is equal to the electrochemical potential minus the local electric potential energy per electron. In solid-state physics, the definitions are normally compatible with this, but occasionally the definitions are swapped.

This article uses the electrochemistry definitions.

== Definition and usage==
In generic terms, electrochemical potential is the mechanical work done in bringing 1 mole of an ion from a standard state to a specified concentration and electrical potential. According to the IUPAC definition, it is the partial molar Gibbs energy of the substance at the specified electric potential, where the substance is in a specified phase. Electrochemical potential can be expressed as

formula_1

where:
* &quot;i&quot; is the electrochemical potential of species &quot;i&quot;, in J/mol,
* &quot;μi&quot; is the chemical potential of the species &quot;i&quot;, in J/mol,
* &quot;zi&quot; is the valency (charge) of the ion &quot;i&quot;, a dimensionless integer,
* &quot;F&quot; is the Faraday constant, in C/mol,
* Φ is the local electrostatic potential in V.

In the special case of an uncharged atom, &quot;zi&quot; = 0, and so &quot;i&quot; = &quot;μi&quot;.

Electrochemical potential is important in biological processes that involve molecular diffusion across membranes, in electroanalytical chemistry, and industrial applications such as batteries and fuel cells. It represents one of the many interchangeable forms of potential energy through which energy may be conserved.

In cell membranes, the electrochemical potential is the sum of the chemical potential and the membrane potential.

==Incorrect usage==
The term &quot;electrochemical potential&quot; is sometimes used to mean an electrode potential (either of a corroding electrode, an electrode with a non-zero net reaction or current, or an electrode at equilibrium). In some contexts, the electrode potential of corroding metals is called &quot;electrochemical corrosion potential&quot;, which is often abbreviated as ECP, and the word &quot;corrosion&quot; is sometimes omitted. This usage can lead to confusion. The two quantities have different meanings and different dimensions: the dimension of electrochemical potential is energy per mole while that of electrode potential is voltage (energy per charge).

<text>Red Wedge was a collective of musicians formed in the UK in 1985 who attempted to educate youth with the policies of the Labour Party leading up to the 1987 general election in the hope of ousting the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher.

==History==
Fronted by Billy Bragg (whose 1985 &quot;Jobs for Youth&quot; tour had been a prototype of sorts for Red Wedge), Paul Weller and the Communards&#x27; lead singer Jimmy Somerville, the Red Wedge held concert parties and appeared in the media, adding their support to the Labour Party campaign.

The group was launched on 21 November 1985, when Bragg, Weller, Strawberry Switchblade and Kirsty MacColl were invited to a reception at the Palace of Westminster hosted by Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Robin Cook. The collective took its name from a 1919 poster by Russian constructivist artist El Lissitzky titled &quot;Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge&quot;. Despite this echo of the Russian Civil War, Red Wedge was not a communist organisation, nor was it an officially arm of the Labour Party, but it did initially occupy office space at Labour&#x27;s headquarters. The group&#x27;s logo, also inspired by the Lissitzky poster, was designed by Neville Brody.

Red Wedge organised a number of major tours. The first, in January and February 1986, featured Bragg, Weller&#x27;s band the Style Council, the Communards, Junior Giscombe, Lorna Gee and Jerry Dammers, with guest appearances by Madness, The The, Heaven 17, Bananarama, Prefab Sprout, Elvis Costello, Gary Kemp, Tom Robinson, Sade, the Beat, Lloyd Cole, the Blow Monkeys, Joolz and the Smiths. At the Labour Party Annual Conference in 1986, Red Wedge&#x27;s support of the party was praised, in a speech on a motion concerning the arms trade, by a conference delegate (Steve Hoyland) who referred particularly to the lyrics of the Billy Bragg song &quot;Island of No Return&quot; which critically references British involvement in the Falklands War.

Red Wedge did not receive universal support from left-wing musicians, and some groups such as the Housemartins, Easterhouse and the Redskins rejected involvement and/or criticised the campaign.

When the general election was called in 1987, Red Wedge organised a comedy tour featuring Lenny Henry, Ben Elton, Robbie Coltrane, Craig Charles, Phill Jupitus, Mark Miwurdz (Hurst) and Harry Enfield, and another tour by the main musical participants along with The The, Captain Sensible and the Blow Monkeys. The group also published an election pamphlet, &quot;Move On Up&quot;, with a foreword by Labour leader Neil Kinnock.

After the 1987 election produced a third consecutive Conservative victory, many of the musical collective drifted away. A few further gigs were arranged and the group&#x27;s magazine &quot;Well Red&quot; continued, but funding eventually disappeared and Red Wedge was formally disbanded in 1990.

<doc id="157625" wikidata="Q702540" url="?curid=157625" title="Harz National Park">
<text>Harz National Park is a nature reserve in the German federal states of Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. It comprises portions of the western Harz mountain range, extending from Herzberg and Bad Lauterberg at the southern edge to Bad Harzburg and Ilsenburg on the northern slopes. 95% of the area is covered with forests, mainly with spruce and beech woods, including several bogs, granite rocks and creeks. The park is part of the Natura 2000 network of the European Union.

In its current form, the park was created on January 1, 2006, by the merger of the Harz National Park in Lower Saxony, established in 1994, and the Upper Harz National Park in Saxony-Anhalt, established in 1990. As the former inner German border ran through the Harz, large parts of the range were prohibited areas, that apart from the fortifications had remained completely unaffected for decades. Today the park covers parts of the districts of Goslar, Göttingen and Harz.

Rare animals of the Harz National Park include the white-throated dipper, the black stork, peregrine falcon, the European wildcat and especially the Eurasian lynx. The last lynx in the Harz Mountains had been shot in 1818, but in 1999 a project for reintroducing was established. Since 2002 several wild lynxes gave birth. An attempt to return the western capercaillie (&quot;Auerhuhn&quot;) however did not succeed.

== Geography ==

The 24,700 hectares of the Harz National Park cover about 10 percent of the total area of the Harz. The park lies in the western part of the Harz (see Upper Harz) and stretches from Wernigerode and Ilsenburg in the north to Herzberg and Bad Lauterberg in the south. Near its perimeter the park terrain is about in the north and in the south and climbs to at the summit of the Brocken.

Several rivers have their sources in the national park, including the Bode, the Oder and the Ilse, a tributary of the Oker. The waters of the Oder, flowing southwards, are collected in the historic Oderteich reservoir, finished in 1722 to supply the mines in Sankt Andreasberg, and feed the Oder Dam on the southeastern edge of the park. Other dams and lakes within or bordering on the national park include the Ecker Dam and the Silberteich. The highest elevations are the Brocken, the Bruchberg and the Achtermann.

== History ==
The present, pan-state &quot;Nationalpark Harz&quot; was formed on 1 January 2006 from the merger of the old park of the same name in Lower Saxony and the High Harz National Park (&quot;Nationalpark Hochharz&quot;) in Saxony-Anhalt. Since the merger the head of this major nature conservation area has been Andreas Pusch.

The Upper Harz National Park was established as part of GDR&#x27;s national park programme on 1 October 1990, two days before the reunification of Germany, on the basis of a ministerial decision by the East German government. The park included large parts of the eastern Harz, roughly from the Ecker Dam and the national park municipality of Ilsenburg in the north and Schierke in the south as well as the Brocken. The region is characterised by a relatively undisturbed plant and animal environment, which is mainly due to its location immediately next to the old Inner German Border. In the German Democratic Republic era, the Brocken was accessible until 1961 with an easily obtained pass. From 13 August 1961 it became an out-of-bounds area, which meant that tourists could no longer visit it. In the mid-1980s the first problems appeared in the Harz, such as bark beetle and fungal infestation. In the wake of the spirit of optimism during the time around reunification it was exactly this that gave impetus for the establishment of the national park. On 1 January 1991 a national park headquarters in Wernigerode was set up under the leadership of Hubertus Hlawatsch. Hlawatsch&#x27;s successor was Peter Gaffert, who ran the eastern park from 1995 until its merger with the Harz National Park in the western Harz on 1 January 2006.

The Lower Saxon part of the park was opened on 1 January 1994 after four years of preparation. Its founding father was Dr. Wolf-Eberhard Barth. Although a combined national park project was discussed soon after reunification by both states it was another twelve years before the parks were merged.

The Harz National Park belongs to the European umbrella organisation EUROPARC Federation, a federation of national parks, biosphere reserves and nature parks. It concerns itself &quot;inter alia&quot; with the exchange of information, ustausch, advanced education and public relations. The German section, EUROPARC Deutschland, of this umbrella organisation has also organised the merger of many large conservation areas in Germany.

In 2005 the national park was included in the European Charter for Sustainable Tourism in Protected Areas.

Currently the national park employs 188 staff, of which 59 work in the national park head office in Wernigerode or its outpost in Sankt Andreasberg OT Oderhaus. The 40 employees of the national park warden service, who are also known as rangers, conduct guided tours and look after tasks in connexion with environmental training, include the maintenance of information posts and national park buildings.

The natural forests of the High Harz consist mainly of Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;) and rowan (&quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot;); deciduous trees only dominate below . Since the Harz was partly deforested in the 19th century by ore mining, the count&#x27;s head forester, Hans Dietrich von Zanthier, developed the concept of reforestation with fast-growing spruce trees. This led to the now widespread spruce monocultures. Unlike &quot;Harz pine&quot;, the pines introduced from other regions cope less well with snow and ice conditions in the Harz and are thus more prone to bark beetle infestation.

Currently 82 percent of the forest consists of spruce stands. Only 12 percent of the trees are beeches. The remaining 6 percent are species such as oak, rowan or birch (as at December 2007).

There are various vegetation zones in the Harz National Park. In the sub-alpine area above 1050 metres is the &quot;battle zone&quot; of the spruce tree. Here it is not uncommon to find trees over 250 years old and bent into bizarre shapes by the wind. But predominant here are the dwarf shrub heaths and raised bogs (&quot;Hochmoore&quot;). The altimontane vegetation zone is found between and , dominated by spruce. These areas can be found in the vicinity of Schierke and Torfhaus. Not until the montane zone between and and the submontane zone is the vegetation dominated by beech forests. Today&#x27;s beech stands grow primarily on acidic soil. The most commonly encountered forest type is the &quot;Hainsimsen&quot; beech forest. At heights above 700 m it is usually adjacent to spruce-beech mixed woodland. But in the national park this area has shrunk to just a few residual stands and has been largely replaced by spruce. In the region of Ilsenburg spruce monoculture occurs even down to . In these zones the spruce is not native and, as a result of climate change, it has suffered increasingly from bark beetle infestation. Currently the National Park Service is having these areas reforested to encourage the original beech and maple, that used to dominate them, to resettle.

The Harz is home to the Brocken anemone (&quot;Pulsatilla alpina&quot; subsp. &quot;alba&quot;), which grows in Germany only on the plateau of the Brocken. Its survival has however been especially endangered since German reunification by the onset of tourism. The Brocken Garden, a botanical garden on the summit of the Brocken, deals mainly with the protection of plant species and restoration of the summit area.

Especially valuable for nature conservation, are the raised bogs formed by the restoration of former marshland. The conditions are favorable for this, as the bogs in the park are less impacted by human use than the bogs of the Lower Saxony plain. When wood became scarce in the Harz, the locals tried to take advantage of the peat bogs. This proved unprofitable due to the low calorific value of peat and the weather conditions in the High Harz. The bogs in the Harz are of international significance by virtue of their distinctiveness and flora.

=== Fauna ===
The lynx now lives wild again in the Harz, having been eradicated from the mountains since the early 19th century. The last report of a successful lynx hunt in the Harz dates to 1818. In an eleven-day hunt, in which almost 200 people took part, a male lynx was brought down at Lautenthal. The so-called Lynx Stone recalls the success of that particular hunt. In 1999 it was decided to reintroduce the lynx. Between 2000 and 2004 alone, 19 were released from zoo breeding programmes. Before their release the animals are prepared in a large enclosure in order to acclimatized them to freedom. In addition there is a viewing enclosure near the National Park forest restaurant on the Rabenklippe where the shy cats can also be observed by visitors to the park. Since 2002, there have been several instances of kittens born in the wild. In March, a male lynx was fitted with a GPS transmitter, so precise details can now be obtained about the range of an animal. The project team receives information via SMS from the transmitter.

Another reintroduction project was the capercaillie, which died out in the Harz in 1920–1930. Its reintroduction began in 1978. Over the years about 1,000 birds have been reared and set free. In spite of the number of birds the population was not assessed as stable. Due to the lack of success, the project was closed in 2003.

The Harz is now one of Germany&#x27;s most important habitats for the wild cat. It is classified in the Federal Republic of Germany as seriously endangered. It is assumed that the wild cat in the Harz has a stable population. It is widespread throughout the region, preferring those areas which are warmer, richer, more varied and better supplied with nutrients (lower lying deciduous forest with greater food availability).

In addition to lynx and wild cat, red deer and roe deer are also important species in the Harz National Park.

The most common invasive species is the raccoon, but occasionally the raccoon dog also occurs. The mouflon, which was in the 1930s located in different districts of the Harz for hunting reasons, is also found in the park.

=== Ecological problems ===
Recently, the Harz National Park has suffered from bark beetle outbreaks as well as acid rain and other environmental problems. The bark beetle is on the rise here due to climate change and global warming. Since 2006, there has been increased bark beetle gradation. Hurricane Kyrill also caused severe damage in the region. Stands of trees, especially spruce, were torn down over wide areas. The National Park management came under fire from the local communities as a result of the bark beetle measures that were subsequently needed. In particular, the National Park community at Ilsenburg criticized the use of technology (e.g. harvesters). Because of the inaccessibility of the terrain there was really no other way to haul the wind blown tree trunks from the affected areas.

In the so-called natural development zone of the Harz National Park, which surrounds the core area, bark beetle measures are taken where necessary, and plantations are established where in order to encourage the natural development of the forest. To protect these beech and oak groves, national park wildlife management is required. Accusations that private or state hunts had taken place in the park turned out to be unfounded.

== Zoning ==

The Harz National Park is recognised by the IUCN (World Conservation Union) as a national park (a Category II protected area in the IUCN system). To achieve that, according to the rules, at least 75 per cent of the area must be set aside as a natural biodiversity zone (core zone). In this zone nature must be left completely to itself. If this proportion is not achieved the region can be classified as a so-called developing national park, if it is assessed as fulfilling these conditions within 30 years.

The Harz National Park counts as a developing national park. Currently 60,3 per cent of the area of the park is designated as a natural biodiversity or core zone. The aim is to cross the 75 per cent threshold by 2020.

38,5 per cent of the park area is currently still a nature development zone. Here measures in lines with the forest development concept are carried out. The aim is to transfer the largest possible area of this natural development zone into the natural biodiversity zone.

A proportion of the park counts as a utilisation zone. This covers areas that are important for tourism or are historico-culturally significant, such as the Brocken summit or mountain meadows. Here conservation measures will also be applied in future.

Furthermore, within a 500 metre wide strip on the edge of the national park, measures are being put into effect that will protect the adjacent areas.

<text>The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), also known simply as the peregrine, is a cosmopolitan bird of prey (raptor) in the family Falconidae. A large, crow-sized falcon, it has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head. The peregrine is renowned for its speed. It can reach over during its characteristic hunting stoop (high-speed dive), making it the fastest animal on the planet. According to a &quot;National Geographic&quot; TV program, the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is . However, radar tracks have never confirmed this, and unimpeachable measurements of speeds even close to the oft-quoted have never been reliably confirmed, and the highest reliably measured speed is . As is typical for bird-eating (avivore) raptors, peregrine falcons are sexually dimorphic, with females being considerably larger than males. Historically, it has also been known as &quot;black-cheeked falcon&quot; in Australia, and &quot;duck hawk&quot; in North America.

The breeding range includes land regions from the Arctic tundra to the tropics. It can be found nearly everywhere on Earth, except extreme polar regions, very high mountains, and most tropical rainforests; the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is New Zealand. This makes it the world&#x27;s most widespread raptor and one of the most widely found wild bird species. In fact, the only land-based bird species found over a larger geographic area owes its success to human-led introduction; the domestic and feral pigeons are both domesticated forms of the rock dove, a major prey species for Eurasian Peregrine populations. Due to their abundance over most other bird species in cities, feral pigeons support many peregrine populations as a staple food source, especially in urban settings.

The peregrine is a highly successful example of urban wildlife in much of its range, taking advantage of tall buildings as nest sites and an abundance of prey such as pigeons and ducks. Both the English and scientific names of this species mean &quot;wandering falcon&quot;, referring to the migratory habits of many northern populations. A total of 18 or 19 regional subspecies are accepted, which vary in appearance; disagreement existed in the past over whether the distinctive Barbary falcon was represented by two subspecies of &quot;Falco peregrinus&quot; or was a separate species, &quot;F. pelegrinoides&quot;, and several of the other subspecies were originally described as species. The genetic differential between them (and also the difference in their appearance) is very small, only about 0.6–0.8% genetically differentiated, showing the divergence is relatively recent, during the time of the Last Ice Age; all the major ornithological authorities now treat the barbary falcon as a subspecies.

Although its diet consists almost exclusively of medium-sized birds, the peregrine will sometimes hunt small mammals, small reptiles, or even insects. Reaching sexual maturity at one year, it mates for life and nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges or, in recent times, on tall human-made structures. The peregrine falcon became an endangered species in many areas because of the widespread use of certain pesticides, especially DDT. Since the ban on DDT from the early 1970s, populations have recovered, supported by large-scale protection of nesting places and releases to the wild.

The peregrine falcon is a well-respected falconry bird due to its strong hunting ability, high trainability, versatility, and availability via captive breeding. It is effective on most game bird species, from small to large. It has also been used as a religious, royal, or national symbol across multiple eras and areas of human civilization.

==Description==

The peregrine falcon has a body length of and a wingspan from . The male and female have similar markings and plumage but, as with many birds of prey, the peregrine falcon displays marked sexual dimorphism in size, with the female measuring up to 30% larger than the male. Males weigh and the noticeably larger females weigh . In most subspecies, males weigh less than and females weigh more than , and cases of females weighing about 50% more than their male breeding mates are not uncommon. The standard linear measurements of peregrines are: the wing chord measures , the tail measures and the tarsus measures .
The back and the long pointed wings of the adult are usually bluish black to slate grey with indistinct darker barring (see &quot;Subspecies&quot; below); the wingtips are black. The white to rusty underparts are barred with thin clean bands of dark brown or black. The tail, coloured like the back but with thin clean bars, is long, narrow, and rounded at the end with a black tip and a white band at the very end. The top of the head and a &quot;moustache&quot; along the cheeks are black, contrasting sharply with the pale sides of the neck and white throat. The cere is yellow, as are the feet, and the beak and claws are black. The upper beak is notched near the tip, an adaptation which enables falcons to kill prey by severing the spinal column at the neck. An immature bird is much browner, with streaked, rather than barred, underparts, and has a pale bluish cere and orbital ring.

A study shows that their black malar stripe exists to reduce glare from solar radiation, allowing them to see better. Photos from The Macaulay Library and iNaturalist showed that the malar stripe is thicker where there is more solar radiation. That supports the solar glare hypothesis.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot; was first described under its current binomial name by English ornithologist Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 work &quot;Ornithologia Britannica&quot;. The scientific name &quot;Falco peregrinus&quot; is a Medieval Latin phrase that was used by Albertus Magnus in 1225. &quot;Peregrinus&quot; is Latin, meaning &quot;one from abroad&quot; or &quot;coming from foreign parts&quot;. It is likely the name was used as juvenile birds were taken while journeying to their breeding location (rather than from the nest), as falcon nests are often difficult to get at. The Latin term for falcon, , is related to , meaning &quot;sickle&quot;, in reference to the silhouette of the falcon&#x27;s long, pointed wings in flight.

The peregrine falcon belongs to a genus whose lineage includes the hierofalcons and the prairie falcon (&quot;F. mexicanus&quot;). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons towards the end of the Late Miocene or in the Late Pliocene, about 3–8 million years ago (mya). As the peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both Old World and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western Eurasia or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear, as the issue is complicated by widespread hybridization confounding mtDNA sequence analyses. One genetic lineage of the saker falcon (&quot;F. cherrug&quot;) is known to have originated from a male saker ancestor producing fertile young with a female peregrine ancestor, and the descendants further breeding with sakers.

===Subspecies===
Numerous subspecies of &quot;Falco peregrinus&quot; have been described, with 18 accepted by the IOC World Bird List, and 19 accepted by the 1994 &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;, which considers the Barbary falcon of the Canary Islands and coastal North Africa to be two subspecies (&quot;F. p. pelegrinoides&quot; and &quot;F. p. babylonicus&quot;) of &quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;, rather than a distinct species, &quot;F. pelegrinoides&quot;. The following map shows the general ranges of these 19 subspecies.

*Falco peregrinus anatum, described by Bonaparte in 1838, is known as the American peregrine falcon or &quot;duck hawk&quot;; its scientific name means &quot;duck peregrine falcon&quot;. At one time, it was partly included in &quot;F. p. leucogenys&quot;. It is mainly found in the Rocky Mountains. It was formerly common throughout North America between the tundra and northern Mexico, where current reintroduction efforts are being made to restore the population. Most mature &quot;F. p. anatum&quot;, except those that breed in more northern areas, winter in their breeding range. Most vagrants that reach western Europe seem to belong to the more northern and strongly migratory &quot;F. p. tundrius&quot;, only considered distinct since 1968. It is similar to the nominate subspecies but is slightly smaller; adults are somewhat paler and less patterned below, but juveniles are darker and more patterned below. Males weigh , while females weigh . It became regionally extinct in eastern North America in the mid 20th century, and populations there now are hybrids as a result of reintroductions of birds from elsewhere.
*Falco peregrinus babylonicus, described by P.L. Sclater in 1861, is found in eastern Iran along the Hindu Kush and the Tian Shan to the Mongolian Altai ranges. A few birds winter in northern and northwestern India, mainly in dry semi-desert habitats. It is paler than &quot;F. p. pelegrinoides&quot; and similar to a small, pale lanner falcon (&quot;Falco biarmicus&quot;). Males weigh , while females weigh .
*, described by Sharpe in 1873, is also known as the Mediterranean peregrine falcon or the Maltese falcon. It includes &quot;F. p. caucasicus&quot; and most specimens of the proposed race &quot;F. p. punicus&quot;, though others may be &quot;F. p. pelegrinoides&quot; (Barbary falcons), or perhaps the rare hybrids between these two which might occur around Algeria. They occur from the Iberian Peninsula around the Mediterranean, except in arid regions, to the Caucasus. They are non-migratory. It is smaller than the nominate subspecies and the underside usually has a rusty hue. Males weigh around , while females weigh up to .
*, described by John Latham in 1790, it was formerly called &quot;F. p. leucogenys&quot; and includes &quot;F. p. caeruleiceps&quot;. It breeds in the Arctic tundra of Eurasia from Murmansk Oblast to roughly Yana and Indigirka Rivers, Siberia. It is completely migratory and travels south in winter as far as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. It is often seen around wetland habitats. It is paler than the nominate subspecies, especially on the crown. Males weigh , while females weigh .
*Falco peregrinus cassini, described by Sharpe in 1873, is also known as the austral peregrine falcon. It includes &quot;F. p. kreyenborgi&quot;, the pallid falcon, a leucistic colour morph occurring in southernmost South America, which was long believed to be a distinct species. Its range includes South America from Ecuador through Bolivia, northern Argentina and Chile to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. It is non-migratory. It is similar to the nominate subspecies, but slightly smaller with a black ear region. The pallid falcon morph &quot;F. p. kreyenborgi&quot; is medium grey above, has little barring below and has a head pattern like the saker falcon (&quot;Falco cherrug&quot;), but the ear region is white.
*Falco peregrinus ernesti, described by Sharpe in 1894, is found from the Sunda Islands to the Philippines and south to eastern New Guinea and the nearby Bismarck Archipelago. Its geographical separation from &quot;F. p. nesiotes&quot; requires confirmation. It is non-migratory. It differs from the nominate subspecies in the very dark, dense barring on its underside and its black ear coverts.
*Falco peregrinus furuitii, described by Momiyama in 1927, is found on the Izu and Ogasawara Islands south of Honshū, Japan. It is non-migratory. It is very rare and may only remain on a single island. It is a dark form, resembling &quot;F. p. pealei&quot; in colour, but darker, especially on the tail.
*Falco peregrinus japonensis, described by Gmelin in 1788, includes &quot;F. p. kleinschmidti&quot;, &quot;F. p. pleskei&quot;, and &quot;F. p. harterti&quot;, and seems to refer to intergrades with &quot;F. p. calidus&quot;. It is found from northeast Siberia to Kamchatka (though it is possibly replaced by &quot;F. p. pealei&quot; on the coast there) and Japan. Northern populations are migratory, while those of Japan are resident. It is similar to the nominate subspecies, but the young are even darker than those of &quot;F. p. anatum&quot;.
*, described by Swainson in 1837, is the Australian peregrine falcon or &quot;black-cheeked falcon&quot;. It is found in Australia in all regions except the southwest, where replaced by &quot;F. p. submelanogenys&quot;; some authorities treat the latter as a synonym of &quot;F. p. macropus&quot;. It is non-migratory. It is similar to &quot;F. p. brookei&quot; in appearance, but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black. The feet are proportionally large.
*Falco peregrinus madens, described by Ripley and Watson in 1963, is unusual in having some sexual dichromatism. If the Barbary falcon (see below) is considered a distinct species, it is sometimes placed therein. It is found in the Cape Verde Islands and is non-migratory; it is also endangered, with only six to eight pairs surviving. Males have a rufous wash on the crown, nape, ears and back; the underside is conspicuously washed pinkish-brown. Females are tinged rich brown overall, especially on the crown and nape.
*Falco peregrinus minor, first described by Bonaparte in 1850. It was formerly often known as &quot;F. p. perconfusus&quot;. It is sparsely and patchily distributed throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and widespread in Southern Africa. It apparently reaches north along the Atlantic coast as far as Morocco. It is non-migratory and dark-coloured. This is the smallest subspecies, with smaller males weighing as little as approximately .
*, described by Mayr in 1941, is found in Fiji and probably also Vanuatu and New Caledonia. It is non-migratory.
*, described by Ridgway in 1873, is Peale&#x27;s falcon and includes &quot;F. p. rudolfi&quot;. It is found in the Pacific Northwest of North America, northwards from Puget Sound along the British Columbia coast (including the Haida Gwaii), along the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to the far eastern Bering Sea coast of Russia, and may also occur on the Kuril Islands and the coasts of Kamchatka. It is non-migratory. It is the largest subspecies and it looks like an oversized and darker &quot;tundrius&quot; or like a strongly barred and large &quot;F. p. anatum&quot;. The bill is very wide. Juveniles occasionally have pale crowns. Males weigh , while females weigh .
*Falco peregrinus pelegrinoides, first described by Temminck in 1829, is found in the Canary Islands through North Africa and the Near East to Mesopotamia. It is most similar to &quot;F. p. brookei&quot;, but is markedly paler above, with a rusty neck, and is a light buff with reduced barring below. It is smaller than the nominate subspecies; females weigh around .
*Falco peregrinus peregrinator, described by Sundevall in 1837, is known as the Indian peregrine falcon, black shaheen, Indian shaheen or shaheen falcon. It was formerly sometimes known as &quot;Falco atriceps&quot; or &quot;Falco shaheen&quot;. Its range includes South Asia from across the Indian subcontinent to Sri Lanka and southeastern China. In India, the shaheen falcon is reported from all states except Uttar Pradesh, mainly from rocky and hilly regions. The shaheen falcon is also reported from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It has a clutch size of 3 to 4 eggs, with the chicks fledging time of 48 days with an average nesting success of 1.32 chicks per nest. In India, apart from nesting on cliffs, it has also been recorded as nesting on man-made structures such as buildings and cellphone transmission towers. A population estimate of 40 breeding pairs in Sri Lanka was made in 1996. It is non-migratory and is small and dark, with rufous underparts. In Sri Lanka this species is found to favour the higher hills, while the migrant &quot;calidus&quot; is more often seen along the coast.
*, the nominate (first-named) subspecies, described by Tunstall in 1771, breeds over much of temperate Eurasia between the tundra in the north and the Pyrenees, Mediterranean region and Alpide belt in the south. It is mainly non-migratory in Europe, but migratory in Scandinavia and Asia. Males weigh , while females weigh . It includes &quot;F. p. brevirostris&quot;, &quot;F. p. germanicus&quot;, &quot;F. p. rhenanus&quot; and &quot;F. p. riphaeus&quot;.
*Falco peregrinus radama, described by Hartlaub in 1861, is found in Madagascar and the Comoros. It is non-migratory.
*, described by Mathews in 1912, is the Southwest Australian peregrine falcon. It is found in southwestern Australia and is non-migratory. Some authorities consider it a synonym of the widespread Australian subspecies &quot;F. p. macropus&quot;.
*, described by C. M. White in 1968, was at one time included in &quot;F. p. leucogenys&quot;. It is found in the Arctic tundra of North America to Greenland, and migrates to wintering grounds in Central and South America. Most vagrants that reach western Europe belong to this subspecies, which was previously considered synonymous with &quot;F. p. anatum&quot;. It is the New World equivalent to &quot;F. p. calidus&quot;. It is smaller and paler than &quot;F. p. anatum&quot;; most have a conspicuous white forehead and white in ear region, but the crown and &quot;moustache&quot; are very dark, unlike in &quot;F. p. calidus&quot;. Juveniles are browner and less grey than in &quot;F. p. calidus&quot; and paler, sometimes almost sandy, than in &quot;F. p. anatum&quot;. Males weigh , while females weigh . Despite its current recognition as a valid subspecies, a population genetic study of both pre-decline (i.e., museum) and recovered contemporary populations failed to distinguish &quot;F. p. anatum&quot; and &quot;F. p. tundrius&quot; genetically.

===Barbary falcon===
The Barbary falcon is a subspecies of the peregrine falcon that inhabits parts of North Africa, from the Canary Islands to the Arabian Peninsula. There was discussion concerning the taxonomic status of the bird, with some considering it a subspecies of the peregrine falcon and others considering it a full species with two subspecies.

Compared to the other peregrine falcon subspecies, Barbary falcons have a slimmer body and a distinct plumage pattern. Despite numbers and range of these birds throughout the Canary Islands generally increasing, they are considered endangered, with human interference through falconry and shooting threatening their well-being. Falconry can further complicate the speciation and genetics of these Canary Islands falcons, as the practice promotes genetic mixing between individuals from outside the islands with those originating from the islands. Population density of the Barbary falcons on Tenerife, the biggest of the seven major Canary Islands, was found to be 1.27 pairs/100 km2, with the mean distance between pairs being 5869 ± 3338 m. The falcons were only observed near large and natural cliffs with a mean altitude of 697.6 m. Falcons show an affinity for tall cliffs away from human-mediated establishments and presence.

Barbary falcons have a red neck patch, but otherwise differ in appearance from the peregrine falcon proper merely according to Gloger&#x27;s rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only the outer part of its wings as fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine falcon, but less often and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon&#x27;s shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine falcon and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed at different times of year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies, but they are capable of interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine falcon-Barbary falcon (&quot;peregrinoid&quot;) complex.

==Ecology and behaviour==

The peregrine falcon lives mostly along mountain ranges, river valleys, coastlines, and increasingly in cities. In mild-winter regions, it is usually a permanent resident, and some individuals, especially adult males, will remain on the breeding territory. Only populations that breed in Arctic climates typically migrate great distances during the northern winter.

The peregrine falcon reaches faster speeds than any other animal on the planet when performing the stoop, which involves soaring to a great height and then diving steeply at speeds of over , hitting one wing of its prey so as not to harm itself on impact. The air pressure from such a dive could possibly damage a bird&#x27;s lungs, but small bony tubercles on a falcon&#x27;s nostrils are theorized to guide the powerful airflow away from the nostrils, enabling the bird to breathe more easily while diving by reducing the change in air pressure. To protect their eyes, the falcons use their nictitating membranes (third eyelids) to spread tears and clear debris from their eyes while maintaining vision. The distinctive malar stripe or &#x27;moustache&#x27;, a dark area of feathers below the eyes, is thought to reduce solar glare and improve contrast sensitivity when targeting fast moving prey in bright light condition; the malar stripe has been found to be wider and more pronounced in regions of the world with greater solar radiation supporting this solar glare hypothesis. Peregrine falcons have a flicker fusion frequency of 129 Hz (cycles per second), very fast for a bird of its size, and much faster than mammals. A study testing the flight physics of an &quot;ideal falcon&quot; found a theoretical speed limit at for low-altitude flight and for high-altitude flight. In 2005, Ken Franklin recorded a falcon stooping at a top speed of .

The life span of peregrine falcons in the wild is up to 19 years 9 months. Mortality in the first year is 59–70%, declining to 25–32% annually in adults. Apart from such anthropogenic threats as collision with human-made objects, the peregrine may be killed by larger hawks and owls.

The peregrine falcon is host to a range of parasites and pathogens. It is a vector for Avipoxvirus, Newcastle disease virus, Falconid herpesvirus 1 (and possibly other Herpesviridae), and some mycoses and bacterial infections. Endoparasites include &quot;Plasmodium relictum&quot; (usually not causing malaria in the peregrine falcon), Strigeidae trematodes, &quot;Serratospiculum amaculata&quot; (nematode), and tapeworms. Known peregrine falcon ectoparasites are chewing lice, &quot;Ceratophyllus garei&quot; (a flea), and Hippoboscidae flies (&quot;Icosta nigra&quot;, &quot;Ornithoctona erythrocephala&quot;).

===Feeding===
The peregrine falcon&#x27;s diet varies greatly and is adapted to available prey in different regions. However, it typically feeds on medium-sized birds such as pigeons and doves, waterfowl, gamebirds, songbirds, parrots, seabirds, and waders. Worldwide, it is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 bird species, or roughly a fifth of the world&#x27;s bird species, are predated somewhere by these falcons. The peregrine falcon preys on the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in North America, with over 300 species and including nearly 100 shorebirds. Its prey can range from hummingbirds (&quot;Selasphorus&quot; and &quot;Archilochus&quot; ssp.) to the sandhill crane, although most prey taken by peregrines weigh between (small passerines) and (ducks, geese, loons, gulls, capercaillies, ptarmigans and other grouse). Smaller hawks (such as sharp-shinned hawks) and owls are regularly predated, as well as smaller falcons such as the American kestrel, merlin and, rarely, other peregrines.

In urban areas, where it tends to nest on tall buildings or bridges, it subsists mostly on a variety of pigeons. Among pigeons, the rock dove or feral pigeon comprises 80% or more of the dietary intake of peregrines. Other common city birds are also taken regularly, including mourning doves, common wood pigeons, common swifts, northern flickers, eurasian collared doves, common starlings, American robins, common blackbirds, and corvids such as magpies, jays or carrion, house, and American crows. Coastal populations of the large subspecies &quot;pealei&quot; feed almost exclusively on seabirds. In the Brazilian mangrove swamp of Cubatão, a wintering falcon of the subspecies &quot;tundrius&quot; was observed successfully hunting a juvenile scarlet ibis.

Among mammalian prey species, bats in the genera &quot;Eptesicus&quot;, &quot;Myotis&quot;, &quot;Pipistrellus&quot; and &quot;Tadarida&quot; are the most common prey taken at night. Though peregrines generally do not prefer terrestrial mammalian prey, in Rankin Inlet, peregrines largely take northern collared lemmings (&quot;Dicrostonyx groenlandicus&quot;) along with a few Arctic ground squirrels (&quot;Urocitellus parryii&quot;). Other small mammals including shrews, mice, rats, voles, and squirrels are more seldom taken. Peregrines occasionally take rabbits, mainly young individuals and juvenile hares. Additionally, remains of red fox kits and adult female American marten were found among prey remains. Insects and reptiles such as small snakes make up a small proportion of the diet, and salmonid fish have been taken by peregrines.

The peregrine falcon hunts most often at dawn and dusk, when prey are most active, but also nocturnally in cities, particularly during migration periods when hunting at night may become prevalent. Nocturnal migrants taken by peregrines include species as diverse as yellow-billed cuckoo, black-necked grebe, virginia rail, and common quail. The peregrine requires open space in order to hunt, and therefore often hunts over open water, marshes, valleys, fields, and tundra, searching for prey either from a high perch or from the air. Large congregations of migrants, especially species that gather in the open like shorebirds, can be quite attractive to a hunting peregrine. Once prey is spotted, it begins its stoop, folding back the tail and wings, with feet tucked. Prey is typically struck and captured in mid-air; the peregrine falcon strikes its prey with a clenched foot, stunning or killing it with the impact, then turns to catch it in mid-air. If its prey is too heavy to carry, a peregrine will drop it to the ground and eat it there. If they miss the initial strike, peregrines will chase their prey in a twisting flight.

Although previously thought rare, several cases of peregrines contour-hunting, i.e., using natural contours to surprise and ambush prey on the ground, have been reported and even rare cases of prey being pursued on foot. In addition, peregrines have been documented preying on chicks in nests, from birds such as kittiwakes. Prey is plucked before consumption. A 2016 study showed that the presence of peregrines benefits non-preferred species while at the same time causing a decline in its preferred prey. As of 2018, the fastest recorded falcon was at 242 mph (nearly 390 km/h). Researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and at Oxford University used 3D computer simulations in 2018 to show that the high speed allows peregrines to gain better maneuverability and precision in strikes.

===Reproduction===
The peregrine falcon is sexually mature at one to three years of age, but in larger populations they breed after two to three years of age. A pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives. The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male&#x27;s talons.

During the breeding season, the peregrine falcon is territorial; nesting pairs are usually more than apart, and often much farther, even in areas with large numbers of pairs. The distance between nests ensures sufficient food supply for pairs and their chicks. Within a breeding territory, a pair may have several nesting ledges; the number used by a pair can vary from one or two up to seven in a 16-year period.
The peregrine falcon nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges. The female chooses a nest site, where she scrapes a shallow hollow in the loose soil, sand, gravel, or dead vegetation in which to lay eggs. No nest materials are added. Cliff nests are generally located under an overhang, on ledges with vegetation. South-facing sites are favoured. In some regions, as in parts of Australia and on the west coast of northern North America, large tree hollows are used for nesting. Before the demise of most European peregrines, a large population of peregrines in central and western Europe used the disused nests of other large birds. In remote, undisturbed areas such as the Arctic, steep slopes and even low rocks and mounds may be used as nest sites. In many parts of its range, peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations.

The pair defends the chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and mountain lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the great horned owl and the Eurasian eagle-owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two species of owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come too close to the nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.

The date of egg-laying varies according to locality, but is generally from February to March in the Northern Hemisphere, and from July to August in the Southern Hemisphere, although the Australian subspecies &quot;F. p. macropus&quot; may breed as late as November, and equatorial populations may nest anytime between June and December. If the eggs are lost early in the nesting season, the female usually lays another clutch, although this is extremely rare in the Arctic due to the short summer season. Generally three to four eggs, but sometimes as few as one or as many as five, are laid in the scrape. The eggs are white to buff with red or brown markings. They are incubated for 29 to 33 days, mainly by the female, with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day, but only the female incubating them at night. The average number of young found in nests is 2.5, and the average number that fledge is about 1.5, due to the occasional production of infertile eggs and various natural losses of nestlings.

After hatching, the chicks (called &quot;es&quot;) are covered with creamy-white down and have disproportionately large feet. The male (called the &quot;&quot;) and the female (simply called the &quot;falcon&quot;) both leave the nest to gather prey to feed the young. The hunting territory of the parents can extend a radius of from the nest site. Chicks fledge 42 to 46 days after hatching, and remain dependent on their parents for up to two months.

==Relationship with humans==

===Use in falconry===
The peregrine falcon is a highly admired falconry bird, and has been used in falconry for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia. Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train. The peregrine falcon has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer (&quot;waiting on&quot;) for game to be flushed, and then performing an effective and exciting high-speed diving stoop to take the quarry. The speed of the stoop not only allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, it also enhances the falcon&#x27;s ability to execute maneuvers to catch highly agile prey, and allows the falcon to deliver a knockout blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself.

Additionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500 g to 300 g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks. The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species, pheasant, and grouse.

Peregrine falcons handled by falconers are also occasionally used to scare away birds at airports to reduce the risk of bird-plane strikes, improving air-traffic safety. They were also used to intercept homing pigeons during World War II.

Peregrine falcons have been successfully bred in captivity, both for falconry and for release into the wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the US were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the US Endangered Species Act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. Peregrine falcons were removed from the United States&#x27; endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with The Peregrine Fund and state and federal agencies – through a technique called hacking. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.

The development of captive breeding methods has led to peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines at this point is to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.

Today, peregrines are regularly paired in captivity with other species such as the lanner falcon (&quot;F. biarmicus&quot;) to produce the &quot;perilanner&quot;, a bird popular in falconry as it combines the peregrine&#x27;s hunting skill with the lanner&#x27;s hardiness, or the gyrfalcon to produce large, strikingly coloured birds for the use of falconers.

===Decline due to pesticides===
The peregrine falcon became an endangered species over much of its range because of the use of organochlorine pesticides, especially DDT, during the 1950s, &#x27;60s, and &#x27;70s. Pesticide biomagnification caused organochlorine to build up in the falcons&#x27; fat tissues, reducing the amount of calcium in their eggshells. With thinner shells, fewer falcon eggs survived until hatching. In addition, the PCB concentrations found in these falcons is dependent upon the age of the falcon. While high levels are still found in young birds (only a few months old) and even higher concentrations are found in more mature falcons, further increasing in adult peregrine falcons. These pesticides caused falcon prey to also have thinner eggshells (one example of prey being the Black Petrels). In several parts of the world, such as the eastern United States and Belgium, this species became locally extinct as a result. An alternate point of view is that populations in the eastern North America had vanished due to hunting and egg collection. Following the ban of organochlorine pesticides, the reproductive success of Peregrines increased in Scotland in terms of territory occupancy and breeding success, although spatial variation in recovery rates indicate that in some areas Peregrines were also impacted by other factors such as persecution.

===Recovery efforts===
Peregrine falcon recovery teams breed the species in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute or with a hand puppet mimicking a peregrine&#x27;s head, so they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage at the top of a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.

Worldwide recovery efforts have been remarkably successful. The widespread restriction of DDT use eventually allowed released birds to breed successfully. The peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list on 25 August 1999.

Some controversy has existed over the origins of captive breeding stock used by the Peregrine Fund in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the contiguous United States. Several peregrine subspecies were included in the breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin. Due to the local extinction of the eastern population of &quot;Falco peregrinus anatum&quot;, its near-extinction in the Midwest, and the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole.

During the 1970s, peregrine falcons in Finland experienced a population bottleneck as a result of large declines associated with bio-accumulation of organochloride pesticides. However, the genetic diversity of peregrines in Finland is similar to other populations, indicating that high dispersal rates have maintained the genetic diversity of this species.

Since peregrine falcon eggs and chicks are still often targeted by illegal poachers, it is common practice not to publicise unprotected nest locations.

===Current status===

Populations of the peregrine falcon have bounced back in most parts of the world. In the United Kingdom, there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB estimated that there were 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK in 2011. In Canada, where peregrines were identified as endangered in 1978 (in the Yukon territory of northern Canada that year, only a single breeding pair was identified), the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada declared the species no longer at risk in December 2017.

Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. Additionally, falcons benefit from artificial illumination, which allows the raptors to extend their hunting periods into the dusk when natural illumination would otherwise be too low for them to pursue prey. In England, this has allowed them to prey on nocturnal migrants such as redwings, fieldfares, starlings, and woodcocks.

In many parts of the world peregrine falcons have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.

In England, peregrine falcons have become increasingly urban in distribution, particularly in southern areas where inland cliffs suitable as nesting sites are scarce. The first recorded urban breeding pair was observed nesting on the Swansea Guildhall in the 1980s. In Southampton, a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months in 2013, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act – on pain of a possible prison sentence – from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged.

In Oregon, Portland houses ten percent of the state&#x27;s peregrine nests, despite only covering around 0.1 percent of the state&#x27;s land area.

==Cultural significance==

Due to its striking hunting technique, the peregrine has often been associated with aggression and martial prowess. The Ancient Egyptian solar deity Ra was often represented as a man with the head of a peregrine falcon adorned with the solar disk, although most Egyptologists agree that it is most likely a Lanner falcon. Native Americans of the Mississippian culture (c. 800–1500) used the peregrine, along with several other birds of prey, in imagery as a symbol of &quot;aerial (celestial) power&quot; and buried men of high status in costumes associating to the ferocity of raptorial birds. In the late Middle Ages, the Western European nobility that used peregrines for hunting, considered the bird associated with princes in formal hierarchies of birds of prey, just below the gyrfalcon associated with kings. It was considered &quot;a royal bird, more armed by its courage than its claws&quot;. Terminology used by peregrine breeders also used the Old French term , &quot;of noble birth; aristocratic&quot;, particularly with the peregrine.

Since 1927, the peregrine falcon has been the official mascot of Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. The 2007 U.S. Idaho state quarter features a peregrine falcon. The peregrine falcon has been designated the official city bird of Chicago.

&quot;The Peregrine&quot;, by J. A. Baker, is widely regarded as one of the best nature books in English written in the twentieth century. Admirers of the book include Robert Macfarlane, Mark Cocker, who regards the book as &quot;one of the most outstanding books on nature in the twentieth century&quot; and Werner Herzog, who called it &quot;the one book I would ask you to read if you want to make films&quot;, and said elsewhere &quot;it has prose of the calibre that we have not seen since Joseph Conrad&quot;. In the book, Baker recounts, in diary form, his detailed observations of peregrines (and their interaction with other birds) near his home in Chelmsford, Essex, over a single winter from October to April.

An episode of the hour-long TV series &quot;Starman&quot; in 1986 titled &quot;Peregrine&quot; was about an injured peregrine falcon and the endangered species program. It was filmed with the assistance of the University of California&#x27;s peregrine falcon project in Santa Cruz.

<doc id="157627" wikidata="Q106010" url="?curid=157627" title="Christmas Eve">
<text>Christmas Eve is the evening or entire day before Christmas, the festival commemorating the birth of Jesus. Christmas Day is observed around the world, and Christmas Eve is widely observed as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day. Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society.

Christmas celebrations in the denominations of Western Christianity have long begun on Christmas Eve, due in part to the Christian liturgical day starting at sunset, a practice inherited from Jewish tradition, and based on the story of Creation in the Book of Genesis: &quot;And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.&quot; Many churches still ring their church bells and hold prayers in the evening; for example, the Nordic Lutheran churches. Since tradition holds that Jesus was born at night (based in Luke 2:6-8), Midnight Mass is celebrated on Christmas Eve, traditionally at midnight, in commemoration of his birth. The idea of Jesus being born at night is reflected in the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as &quot;Heilige Nacht&quot; (Holy Night) in German, &quot;Nochebuena&quot; (the Good Night) in Spanish and similarly in other expressions of Christmas spirituality, such as the song &quot;Silent Night, Holy Night&quot;.

Many other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world, including the gathering of family and friends, the singing of Christmas carols, the illumination and enjoyment of Christmas lights, trees, and other decorations, the wrapping, exchange and opening of gifts, and general preparation for Christmas Day. Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind, and Saint Nicholas are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve, although until the Protestant introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe, such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of Saint Nicholas&#x27; feast day (6 December).

== Religious traditions ==

=== Western churches ===

Western churches have traditionally observed Christmas Eve (properly the Vigil of the Nativity) as a liturgical observance distinct from the masses of Christmas Day, with the proper Gospel at the Mass for the Vigil of the Nativity being that of the Annunciation to Joseph in Matthew 1. The Vigil of the Nativity is not so much the first day of Christmas as it is the last day of Advent, and so it traditionally retains the liturgical color of violet. In traditional western liturgical practice, when the Fourth Sunday of Advent and Christmas Eve occur on the same day, the Sunday mass is of Christmas Eve and the Fourth Sunday of Advent is only commemorated.

The festivities of Christmas Day have, however, extended farther and farther back into Christmas Eve. While Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and some Anglicans traditionally celebrate Midnight Mass, the first mass of Christmas, either at or near midnight on Christmas Eve, some churches have in recent decades scheduled their &quot;Midnight&quot; Mass as early as 7 pm in an effort to better accommodate young children, whose choral singing has become a popular feature in some traditions.

Midnight Mass is held in churches throughout the world and celebrates the birth of Christ, which is believed to have occurred at night. Midnight Mass is popular in Poland (pasterka) and Lithuania (piemenėlių mišios). In Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula, the Midnight Mass is also referred to as &quot;Rooster&#x27;s Mass&quot; (&quot;Misa de Gallo&quot; in Spanish, &quot;Missa do Galo&quot; in Portuguese and &quot;Missa del Gall&quot; in Catalan). In the Philippines, the custom has expanded into the nine-day &quot;Simbang Gabi&quot;, when Filipinos attend dawn Masses (traditionally beginning around 04:00 to 05:00 PST) from 16 December, continuing daily until Christmas Eve. In 2009 Vatican officials scheduled the Midnight Mass to start at 10 pm so that the 82-year-old Pope Benedict XVI would not have too late a night.

A nativity scene may be erected indoors or outdoors, and is composed of figurines depicting the infant Jesus resting in a manger, Mary, and Joseph. Other figures in the scene may include angels, shepherds, and various animals. The figures may be made of any material, and arranged in a stable or grotto. The Magi may also appear, and are sometimes not placed in the scene until the week following Christmas to account for their travel time to Bethlehem. While most home nativity scenes are packed away at Christmas or shortly thereafter, nativity scenes in churches usually remain on display until the feast of the Baptism of the Lord.

Throughout congregations of the various denominations of Christianity, on Christmas Eve, the Christ Candle in the center of the Advent wreath is traditionally lit in many church services. In candlelight services, while singing &quot;Silent Night&quot;, each member of the congregation receives a candle and passes along their flame which is first received from the Christ Candle.

Lutherans traditionally practice Christmas Eve Eucharistic traditions typical of Germany and Scandinavia. &quot;Krippenspiele&quot; (Nativity plays), special festive music for organ, vocal and brass choirs and candlelight services make Christmas Eve one of the most beloved days in the Lutheran Church calendar. Christmas Vespers is popular in the early evening, and Midnight Masses are also widespread in regions which are predominantly Lutheran. The old Lutheran tradition of a Christmas Vigil in the early morning hours of Christmas Day (Christmette) can still be found in some regions. In eastern and middle Germany, congregations still continue the tradition of &quot;Quempas singing&quot;: separate groups dispersed in various parts of the church sing verses of the song &quot;He whom shepherds once came Praising&quot; (&quot;Quem pastores laudavere&quot;) responsively.

With respect to Presbyterianism, the Church of Scotland has a service beginning just before midnight, in which carols are sung. These services are very popular.

Methodists celebrate the evening in different ways. Some, in the early evening, come to their church to celebrate Holy Communion with their families. The mood is very solemn, and the only visible light is the Advent Wreath, and the candles upon the Lord&#x27;s Table. Others celebrate the evening with services of light, which include singing the song &quot;Silent Night&quot; as a variety of candles (including personal candles) are lit. Other churches have late evening services perhaps at 11 pm, so that the church can celebrate Christmas Day together with the ringing of bells at midnight. Others offer Christmas Day services as well.

The annual &quot;Nine Lessons and Carols&quot;, broadcast from King&#x27;s College, Cambridge on Christmas Eve, has established itself a Christmas custom in the United Kingdom, where Anglican Christianity is the traditional faith. It is broadcast outside the UK via the BBC World Service, and is also bought by broadcasters around the world.

=== Eastern churches ===

In the Byzantine Rite, Christmas Eve is referred to as Paramony (&quot;preparation&quot;). It is the concluding day of the Nativity Fast and is observed as a day of strict fasting by those devout Byzantine Christians who are physically capable of doing so. In some traditions, nothing is eaten until the first star appears in the evening sky, in commemoration of the Star of Bethlehem. The liturgical celebration begins earlier in the day with the celebration of the Royal Hours, followed by the Divine Liturgy combined with the celebration of Vespers, during which a large number of passages from the Old Testament are chanted, recounting the history of salvation. After the dismissal at the end of the service, a new candle is brought out into the center of the church and lit, and all gather round and sing the Troparion and Kontakion of the Feast.

In the evening, the All-Night Vigil for the Feast of the Nativity is composed of Great Compline, Matins and the First Hour. The Byzantine services of Christmas Eve are intentionally parallel to those of Good Friday, illustrating the theological point that the purpose of the Incarnation was to make possible the Crucifixion and Resurrection. This is illustrated in Eastern icons of the Nativity, on which the Christ Child is wrapped in swaddling clothes reminiscent of his burial wrappings. The child is also shown lying on a stone, representing the Tomb of Christ, rather than a manger. The Cave of the Nativity is also a reminder of the cave in which Jesus was buried.

The services of Christmas Eve are also similar to those of the Eve of Theophany (Epiphany), and the two Great Feasts are considered one celebration.

In some Orthodox cultures, after the Vesperal Liturgy the family returns home to a festive meal, but one at which Orthodox fasting rules are still observed: no meat or dairy products (milk, cheese, eggs, etc.) are consumed (see below for variations according to nationality). Then they return to the church for the All-Night Vigil.

The next morning, Christmas Day, the Divine Liturgy is celebrated again, but with special features that occur only on Great Feasts of the Lord. After the dismissal of this Liturgy, the faithful customarily greet each other with the kiss of peace and the words: &quot;Christ is Born!&quot;, to which the one being greeted responds: &quot;Glorify Him!&quot; (the opening words of the Canon of the Nativity that was chanted the night before during the Vigil). This greeting, together with many of the hymns of the feast, continue to be used until the leave-taking of the feast on 31 December.

The first three days of the feast are particularly solemn. The second day is known as the Synaxis of the Theotokos, and commemorates the role of the Virgin Mary in the Nativity of Jesus. The third day is referred to simply as &quot;the Third Day of the Nativity&quot;. The Saturday and Sunday following 25 December have special Epistle and Gospel readings assigned to them. 29 December celebrates the Holy Innocents.

Byzantine Christians observe a festal period of twelve days, during which no one in the Church fasts, even on Wednesdays and Fridays, which are normal fasting days throughout the rest of the year. During this time one feast leads into another: 25–31 December is the afterfeast of the Nativity; 2–5 January is the forefeast of the Epiphany.

== Christmas Eve dinner ==
=== Bulgaria ===
In Bulgaria, the meal consists of an odd number of lenten dishes in compliance with the rules of fasting. They are usually the traditional sarma, bob chorba (bean soup), fortune kravai (pastry with a fortune in it; also called &quot;bogovitsa&quot;, &quot;vechernik&quot;, &quot;kolednik&quot;), stuffed peppers, nuts, dried fruit, boiled wheat. The meal is often accompanied with wine or Bulgaria&#x27;s traditional alcoholic beverage rakia, in the past &quot;olovina&quot; (a type of homemade rye beer). The meals used to be put on top of hay, directly on the floor, together with a ploughshare or a coulter.

=== Cuba ===
In Cuba, roasted pig () is often the center of Christmas Eve (). It is believed that the tradition dates back to the 15th century when Caribbean colonists hunted down pigs and roasted them with a powerful flame.

In Cuban and Cuban-American tradition, the pig is sometimes cooked in a , a large box where an entire pig is placed below hot coals. The dinner features many side dishes and desserts, and often games of dominoes are played. The tradition is continued by Cuban families in Florida and the United States. The dinner on the Christmas Eve is the center of the celebration.

Christmas Eve dinner is generally not served at a set time, though it is typically eaten as a family. It is expected that the entire family will be at the table to start tasting the (sleeping black beans) and the (shredded white rice), the (a Cuban side dish made by marinating cassava in garlic, sour orange, and olive oil), the roasted pork or the stuffed or unfilled , along with homemade desserts, such as Christmas fritters, and a wide range of sweets in syrup and Spanish nougat.

The visit to the archipelago of Pope John Paul II, in 1998, prompted the Cuban government, in a gesture of goodwill, to declare 25 December again as a holiday, which it had not been for several decades.

=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, fasting on the day of Christmas Eve (or only eating meatless food) is a medieval tradition. The belief is that if one lasted until Christmas dinner, they would see a golden pig, which is a symbol of luck. A typical Christmas breakfast is a sweet braided bread &quot;vánočka&quot;. Christmas Eve dinner traditionally consists of a carp (baked or fried) and a potato salad.

=== France ===
In French-speaking places, Réveillon is a long dinner eaten on Christmas Eve.

=== Guam and the Northern Marianas ===
In Guam and the Northern Marianas, dishes include shrimp &quot;kelaguen&quot;; coconut crab; and &quot;kadon&quot; octopus (octopus stewed in sweet peppers and coconut milk). Beef is a rarity, but a popular dish is &quot;tinaktak&quot;, ground beef in coconut milk.

=== Germany ===
During the Christmas period, the Weihnachtsmarkt (Christmas market) becomes a feature of almost every city, town, or village in the German-speaking countries, where visitors enjoy stalls, entertainment, and savour food and &quot;Glühwein&quot; (mulled wine). Traditional Christmastime treats include Lebkuchen (gingerbread), Stollen (fruit cake), Speculaas and marzipan (almond confectionery often made into sweets). Perhaps the most famed of these markets is the Christkindlesmarkt held in Nuremberg, which attracts millions of visitors every year.

The Weihnachtsbaum (Christmas tree) is usually put up in the afternoon of 24 December. The trees can be bought at special traders&#x27; sites, but some families may still go into the forest and cut one themselves. The Christkind brings the presents on the evening of Christmas eve. 

Traditionally, on &quot;Heiligabend&quot; (Christmas Eve) in Germany, a simple meal will be prepared and served before or after the &quot;Bescherung&quot; (&quot;time for exchanging gifts&quot;), in contrast to the big meal on Christmas Day. Various polls repeatedly declare (Eintopf) or sausages (Würstchen) with potato salad to be Germany&#x27;s favourite meal on &quot;Heiligabend&quot;. Further typical meals may include carp, fondue or raclette. On Christmas Day, the most common dishes are roast goose or duck.

=== Italy ===

Christmas in Italy is one of the country&#x27;s major holidays and begins on 8 December, with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally the Christmas tree is mounted and ends on 6 January, of the following year with the Epiphany. According to tradition, the Christmas Eve dinner must not contain meat. It is quite common to attend Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve and practice the old custom of abstinence from meat on the day (but not fasting, which is observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church). Traditions regarding the exchanging of gifts vary from region to region, as this may take place either on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day. On 24 December, Christmas Eve, the Christmas night mass, also called Midnight Mass, is celebrated.

While other Christian families throughout the world celebrate the Christmas Eve meal with various meats, Italians (especially Sicilians) celebrate the traditional Catholic &quot;Feast of the Seven Fishes&quot; which was historically served after a 24-hour fasting period. Although Christmas fasting is no longer a popular custom, some Italian-Americans still enjoy a meatless Christmas Eve feast and attend the Midnight Mass. In various cultures, a festive dinner is traditionally served for the family and close friends in attendance, when the first star (usually Sirius) appears in the sky.

=== Lithuania ===
Lithuanian Christmas Eve blends pagan and Christian traditions, as initially it was a celebration of the winter solstice. Traditionally, Lithuanians believed that animals could talk on that night, and it was possible to predict the future with charms and various games. &quot;Kūčios&quot; (&quot;Holy Meal&quot;) is the most important event of the year and family reunion. Dead relatives are remembered with an empty plate set at the table. The feast starts after the rise of the evening star. No products made from meat, milk and alcohol are allowed during the Kūčios. In all, 12 dishes are served, all of them rustic, made from grains, fish, dried fruit or mushrooms including &quot;kūčiukai&quot;. Small biscuits soaked in poppy seed milk are served. After the dinner is over the table is left uncleared overnight for the feast of &quot;&quot; (spirits or soul).

=== Peru ===
In Peru, turkey and panettone are the stars of Christmas Eve.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, the traditional dinner (known as &quot;noche buena&quot; or &quot;nochebuena&quot;) is served at midnight after the family attends the late evening Mass known as &quot;Misa de Gallo&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Misa de Aguinaldo&quot;, &quot;Gift Mass&quot;). Common traditional dishes served for the main course include: lechón, various types of pancit (noodles), Filipino spaghetti, &quot;hamonado&quot;, &quot;jamón&quot;, &quot;queso de bola&quot;, &quot;morcón&quot;, &quot;embutido&quot;, chicken galantina, &quot;almondigas&quot; (meatballs), &quot;paelya&quot; (&quot;arroz valenciana&quot;, &quot;bringhe&quot;, etc.), &quot;lumpia&quot;, &quot;menudo&quot;, &quot;mechado&quot;, &quot;caldereta&quot;, &quot;callos&quot;, chicken pastel, &quot;relyenong bangús&quot; (stuffed milkfish), &quot;lengua estofado&quot;, &quot;adobo&quot;, and various types of barbecue (&quot;inihaw&quot;). Almost all of these dishes are eaten with white rice. Desserts and side dishes include &quot;úbe halayá&quot;, turon, leche flan, macaroni salad, &quot;membrilyo&quot;, fruit salad, buko salad, &quot;crema de fruta&quot;, &quot;ensaymada&quot;, champorado, mango float, fruitcake, &quot;castañas&quot; (roasted chestnuts), and various other &quot;kakanin&quot; (rice cakes) like &quot;puto bumbong&quot;, &quot;bibingka&quot;, &quot;suman&quot;, &quot;biko&quot;, and &quot;sapin-sapin&quot;. Popular beverages are &quot;tsokolate&quot; as well as coffee, soda, wine, beer, alcoholic drinks, and fruit juices.

=== Poland ===

A tradition similar to Italy (&quot;Wigilia&quot;, or &#x27;Christmas Vigil&#x27;) exists in Poland. The number of dishes is traditionally 12, but has been an odd number in the past. According to the &quot;Słownik etymologiczny języka polskiego&quot; (&quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Polish Language&quot;) by Aleksander Brückner, the number of dishes was traditionally related to social class: the peasants&#x27; vigil consisted of 5 or 7 dishes, the gentry usually had 9, and the aristocracy, 11 dishes, but the even number 12 is also found today to remember the Twelve Apostles. It is obligatory to try a portion of all of them. Some traditions specify that the number of guests cannot be odd.

In Poland, gifts are unwrapped on Christmas Eve, as opposed to Christmas Day. It comes from fusing the traditions of Saint Nicholas Day (6 December) and Christmas. In the past, gifts were opened on the morning of Saint Nicholas Day.

=== Puerto Rico ===
In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, the traditional Christmas Eve dinner consists of arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas), &quot;lechón asado&quot; (pig roast) or pernil asado (pork roast shoulder), &quot;morcilla&quot; (rice-filled pork blood sausage), pasteles (root vegetable-based dough, meat-filled tamale), guineitos en escabeche (marinated, sliced green bananas), &quot;ensalada de papa puertorriqueña&quot; (Puerto Rican potato salad), and &quot;ensalada de coditos puertorriqueña&quot; (Puerto Rican macaroni salad). The traditional Christmas Eve desserts are arroz con dulce (coconut rice pudding), tembleque (coconut pudding), &quot;flan de queso o coco&quot; (cheese or coconut caramel custard), &quot;tierrita&quot; (chocolate mousse), turrón&quot;, galletas florecitas&quot; (small meringue-topped biscuits), Danish butter biscuits, &quot;nueces surtidas&quot; (assorted shelled nuts), &quot;bombones&quot; &quot;dulces de navidad surtidos&quot; (assorted Christmas hard candy). The traditional Christmas Eve beverages are coquito (coconut eggnog), Don Q or Bacardi (rum), and Pitorro (moonshine rum).

=== Russia ===
&quot;Rozhdenstvenskiy sochelnik&quot; () was a common Eastern Orthodox tradition in the Russian Empire, but during the era of the Soviet Union it was greatly discouraged as a result of the official atheism of the former regime.

In modern-day Russia, the church has a service on that day, but the celebration itself has not yet regained its popularity among the people. Instead of the Christmas Eve, New Year&#x27;s Eve is considered to be a traditional family celebration featuring the New Year tree.

=== Serbia ===

In accordance with the Christmas traditions of the Serbs, their festive meal has a copious and diverse selection of foods, although it is prepared according to the rules of fasting.

As well as a round, unleavened loaf of bread and salt, which are necessary, this meal may comprise roast fish, cooked beans, sauerkraut, noodles with ground walnuts, honey, and wine.

Families in some Slavic countries leave an empty place at the table for guests (alluding to Mary and Joseph looking for shelter in Bethlehem).

=== Ukraine ===
In Ukraine, &quot;Sviatyi Vechir&quot; (, Holy Evening) is traditionally celebrated with a meatless twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper, or the Holy Supper (, Sviata Vecheria). The main attributes of the Holy Supper in Ukraine are kutia, a poppy seed, honey and wheat dish, and uzvar, a drink made from reconstituted dried fruits. Other typical dishes are borscht, varenyky, and dishes made of fish, phaseolus and cabbage.

The twelve dishes symbolize the Twelve Apostles. Just as in Poland, it is obligatory to try a portion of all of the dishes. The table is spread with a white cloth symbolic of the swaddling clothes the Child Jesus was wrapped in, and a large white candle stands in the center of the table symbolizing Christ the Light of the World. Next to it is a round loaf of bread symbolizing Christ Bread of Life. Hay is often displayed either on the table or as a decoration in the room, reminiscent of the manger in Bethlehem.

=== Venezuela ===
In Venezuela, hallacas are normally the staple dish for Noche Buena alongside of either ham or pork leg known as &quot;pernil&quot;, panettone, rum and &quot;Ponche Crema&quot; (a form of alcoholic eggnog). The night is usually accompanied by traditional Christmas music known as &quot;aguinaldos&quot;; in Venezuela, the traditional music is known as joropo.

== Gift giving ==

In Christianity, the giving of gifts during Christmastide is traced to the Magi who brought gifts for the Christ child in the manger. During the Reformation in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or &quot;Christkindl&quot;, and the date of giving gifts changed from 6 December to Christmas Eve. It is the night when Santa Claus makes his rounds delivering gifts to good children. 

In Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, where Saint Nicholas (sv. Mikuláš/szent Mikulás) gives gifts on 6 December, the Christmas gift-giver is the Child Jesus (Ježíšek in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian, Ježiško in Slovak and Isusek in Croatian).

In Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and Switzerland, presents are traditionally exchanged on the evening of 24 December. Children are commonly told that presents were brought either by the Christkind (German for Christ child), or by the Weihnachtsmann. Both leave the gifts, but are in most families not seen doing so. In Germany, the gifts are also brought on 6 December by &quot;the Nikolaus&quot; with his helper Knecht Ruprecht.

In Estonia &quot;Jõuluvana&quot;, Finland &quot;Joulupukki&quot;, Denmark &quot;Julemanden&quot;, Norway &quot;Julenissen&quot; and Sweden &quot;Jultomten&quot;, personally meets children and gives presents in the evening of Christmas Eve.

In Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Quebec (French Canada), Romania, Uruguay, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Switzerland, Christmas presents are opened mostly on the evening of the 24th—following German tradition, this is also the practice among the British Royal Family since it was introduced by Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort—while in Italy, the United States, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Malta, English Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, this occurs mostly on the morning of Christmas Day.

Some countries do their gift-giving earlier in the month, connected to the tradition either Epiphany (in Spain, the morning of 6 January) or Sinterklaas (Belgium and the Netherlands, on the evening of 5 December).

== Other traditions ==

Christmas Eve is celebrated in different ways around the world, varying by country and region. Elements common to many areas of the world include the attendance of special religious observances such as a midnight Mass or Vespers and the giving and receiving of presents. Along with Easter, Christmastime is one of the most important periods on the Christian calendar, and is often closely connected to other holidays at this time of year, such as Advent, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, St. Nicholas Day, St. Stephen&#x27;s Day, New Year&#x27;s, and the Feast of the Epiphany.

Among Christians, as well as non-Christians who celebrate Christmas, the significant amount of vacation travel, and travel back to family homes, that takes place in the lead-up to Christmas means that Christmas Eve is also frequently a time of social events and parties, worldwide.

=== In Jewish culture ===
Nittel Nacht is a name given to Christmas Eve by Jewish scholars in the 17th century.

==== In contemporary American-Jewish culture ====
With Christmas Day a work holiday throughout the United States, there is a space of unfilled free time during which much of American commerce and society is not functioning, and which can give rise to a sense of loneliness or alienation for American Jews.

Jews also typically do not engage in the family gathering and religious worship activities that are central to Christmas Eve for Christians.

Typical contemporary activities have usually been limited to &quot;Chinese and a movie&quot;—consuming a meal at a Chinese restaurant, which tend to be open for business on the Christmas holiday, and watching a movie at the theater or at home, stereotypically a rerun of the 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

Since the 1980s a variety of social events for young Jews have sprung up, and become popular, on Christmas Eve. These include the Matzo Ball, The Ball, and a number of local events organized by Jewish communities and local Jewish Federations in North America.

=== In Chinese culture ===
In Mandarin, Christmas Eve is called (, &quot;peaceful night&quot;, etymologically from the Chinese title of the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot;). People exchange apples, because the word for &quot;apple&quot; (果) is a rhyming wordplay with &quot;peace&quot; (安).

=== In Inuit culture ===
In Inuit territories, Christmas Eve is called &quot;Quviasukvik&quot;. The Inuit celebrate it as their new year.

=== United States ===
In New Mexico and areas of San Diego, California, Christmas Eve (&quot;nochebuena&quot;) is celebrated by lighting luminarias and farolitos.

== Historical events ==

A number of historical events have been influenced by the occurrence of Christmas Eve.

=== Christmas truce ===

During World War I in 1914 and 1915 there was an unofficial Christmas truce, particularly between British and German troops. The truce began on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1914, when German troops began decorating the area around their trenches in the region of Ypres, Belgium, for Christmas. They began by placing candles on trees, then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols, most notably &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; (&quot;Silent Night&quot;). The British troops in the trenches across from them responded by singing English carols. The two sides shouted Christmas greetings to each other. Soon there were calls for visits across the &quot;No man&#x27;s land&quot; when small gifts were exchanged. The truce also allowed a breathing space during which recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Funerals took place as soldiers from both sides mourned the dead together and paid their respects. At one funeral in No Man&#x27;s Land, soldiers from both sides gathered and read a passage from Psalm 23. The truce occurred in spite of opposition at higher levels of the military command. Earlier in the autumn, a call by Pope Benedict XV for an official truce between the warring governments had been ignored.

<text>Clausthal-Zellerfeld is a town in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is located in the southwestern part of the Harz mountains. Its population is approximately 15,000. The town hosts the Clausthal University of Technology. The health resort is located in the Upper Harz at an altitude between 390 and 821 m above sea level.

== Geography ==
Clausthal-Zellerfeld is located on the Upper Harz Plateau. The surrounding area is less mountainous compared to most of the Harz. As a result, the adjacent area is less wooded and there is more pasture land. Scattered in and around Clausthal-Zellerfeld are numerous dams and streams belonging to the Upper Harz Water Regale.

The depression between Clausthal and Zellerfeld marks a natural &quot;borderline&quot;.

Southwest extends the &quot;Small Clausthal valley&quot;.

=== City districts ===
* Altenau-Schulenberg im Oberharz (since 2015)
* Buntenbock (since 1972)
* Clausthal-Zellerfeld
* Wildemann (since 2015)

== History ==
Clausthal-Zellerfeld originally consisted of two towns which were merged in 1924 to form an administrative unit. Clausthal is well known for the old Clausthal University of Technology and its magnificent buildings, while Zellerfeld is a typical tourist resort for hikers and winter sportsmen. Clausthal-Zellerfeld is the largest town in the area that is situated in the mountains rather than on the edge.

Mining in the area began in the 16th century. Modern wire rope was invented to service the iron mines in the 1830s by the German mining engineer Wilhelm Albert in the years between 1831 and 1834 for use in mining in the Harz Mountains in Clausthal. It was quickly accepted because it proved superior to ropes made of hemp or to metal chains, such as had been used before and soon found its way into diverse applications, including most notably, suspension bridges. The Innerste Valley Railway was inaugurated in 1877 and extended to Altenau in 1914. The large station building and 70 other buildings in the town were destroyed in an air raid on 7 October 1944. 92 people lost their lives.

Mining activity halted in 1930 because the ore deposits were exhausted. Today, there are large remains of mines in the surrounding Harz region, some of which are now museums. The railway line was closed in 1976. The former railway station, which was rebuilt from 1961–1963 after being destroyed in 1944, houses the tourist information and the municipal library today.

The Clausthal University of Technology was established in 1775 for the education of mining engineers. Today, it is a technical university for teaching engineering, natural science (especially chemistry, materials science and physics), computer science and business studies.

== Politics ==

=== Town council ===
2006 local elections:
* SPD: 19 seats
* CDU: 9 seats
* FDP: 3 seats
* UWG: 2 seats (independent electors community)

== Culture and sights ==

* Oberharzer Wasserwirschaft (Upper Harz Water Management)

=== Museums ===
* Upper Harz Mining Museum
* GeoMuseum of Clausthal University of Technology

=== Buildings ===

* Market Church in Clausthal, the largest wooden church in Germany with 2,200 seats, built 1639-42. Tower dating from 1637.
* Old pharmacy &quot;Bergapotheke&quot; in Zellerfeld, built in 1674, with wood carvings

== Infrastructure ==

The retail trade is mostly located in the main center around Adolph-Roemer-Straße in the Clausthal district. Small-scale retail can be found in the side center in the Zellerfeld district. At the beginning of 2000, an area at the former Ostbahnhof was designated as a special location for large-scale retail. Further supermarkets can be found at the northern exit of Zellerfeld. Overall, the retail trade in the former mountain town is not very well developed and is now suffering from the general decline in shops.

The development of the Clausthal University of Technology is of great importance for the mining town of Clausthal-Zellerfeld, as it increases the attractiveness and attraction of the location for innovative investments. The development of the TU Clausthal and the cooperation between local companies and science is a decisive advantage for the business location.

In addition to the usual craft businesses, there is a relatively large window factory as well as several companies spun off from the Clausthal University of Technology or CUTEC, which specialize primarily in particle measurement technology in testing technology.

Tourism is another important branch of the economy in Clausthal-Zellerfeld, but above all in its districts Altenau, Buntenbock, Schulenberg and Wildemann.

=== Traffic ===
From 1877 to 1976, the Langelsheim–Altenau (Oberharz) railway ran trains from the station to Altenau and Langelsheim. Today the public transport is served by several bus lines that travel to Goslar, Osterode am Harz, Altenau and Sankt Andreasberg.

* State Office for Mining, Energy and Geology with the Lower Saxony Mountain Archive
* CUTEC, Clausthal Environmental Technology Research Center
* State Construction Management South Lower Saxony
* Local fire brigades in the districts Altenau, Clausthal- Zellerfeld, Buntenbock, Schulenberg and Wildemann

=== Education ===

<text>Godfrey of Bouillon (; ; ; ; 1060 – 18 July 1100) was a preeminent leader of the First Crusade, and the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from 1099 to 1100. Although initially reluctant to take the title of king, he agreed to rule as prince (&quot;princeps&quot;) under the title &quot;Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri&quot;, or Advocate of the Holy Sepulchre.

He was the second son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne in France. He received an inheritance from his mother&#x27;s family in 1076 when he became Lord of Bouillon, which is now in Belgium. In 1087 Emperor Henry IV also confirmed him as Duke of Lower Lorraine, in reward for his support during the Great Saxon Revolt.

Along with his brothers Eustace III and Baldwin of Boulogne, Godfrey joined the First Crusade in 1096. He took part in actions at Nicaea, Dorylaeum, and Antioch, before playing a key role during the capture of Jerusalem in 1099. When Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse declined the offer to become ruler of the new kingdom, Godfrey accepted the role and secured his kingdom by defeating the Fatimids at Ascalon a month later, bringing the First Crusade to an end. He died in July 1100 and was succeeded by his brother Baldwin as King of Jerusalem.

==Early life==
Godfrey of Bouillon was born around 1060, second son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne and Ida, daughter of the Lotharingian duke Godfrey the Bearded and his first wife, Doda. He was probably born in Boulogne-sur-Mer, although one 13th-century chronicler cites Baisy, a town in what is now Walloon Brabant, Belgium. As second son, he had fewer opportunities than his older brother. However his maternal uncle, Godfrey the Hunchback, died childless and named his nephew, Godfrey of Bouillon, as his heir and next in line to his Duchy of Lower Lorraine. This duchy was an important one at the time, serving as a buffer between the French kingdom and the German lands.

In fact, Lower Lorraine was so important to the Holy Roman Empire that in 1076 Henry IV (reigned 1056–1105), then King of the Romans and future emperor, decided to place it in the hands of his own son and give Godfrey only Bouillon and the Margraviate of Antwerp, allegedly as a test of his loyalty. Godfrey supported Henry even during his struggle with Pope Gregory VII during the Investiture Controversy. Godfrey fought alongside Henry and his forces against Rudolf of Swabia and in Italy when Henry captured Rome itself.

A major test of Godfrey&#x27;s leadership skills was shown in his battles to defend his inheritance against a significant array of enemies. In 1076 he had succeeded as designated heir to the Lotharingian lands of his uncle, Godfrey the Hunchback, and Godfrey was struggling to maintain control over the lands that Henry IV had not taken away from him. Claims were raised by his aunt Margravine Matilda of Tuscany, cousin Count Albert III of Namur, and Count Theoderic of Veluwe. This coalition was joined by Bishop Theoderic of Verdun, and two minor counts attempting to share in the spoils, Waleran I of Limburg and Arnold I of Chiny.

As these enemies tried to take away portions of his land, Godfrey&#x27;s brothers, Eustace and Baldwin, both came to his aid. Following these long struggles and proving that he was a loyal vassal to Henry IV, Godfrey finally gained Lower Lorraine in 1087.

==First Crusade==

In 1095 Pope Urban II called for military action in order to liberate Jerusalem and aid the Byzantine Empire, which in the years since 1071 had lost large swathes of territory to the Seljuk Empire. Godfrey either sold or mortgaged most of his estates to the bishops of Liège and Verdun and used the money to recruit an army of Crusaders. He was joined by his older brother, Eustace, and his younger brother, Baldwin, who had no lands in Europe and was seeking them in the Holy Land. Others did the same, the largest being that raised by Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, who at 55 was the oldest and most experienced of the Crusader nobles. As a result, he expected to lead the expedition, a claim boosted by the presence of Adhemar of Le Puy, the papal legate who travelled with him. Significant forces also accompanied Bohemond of Taranto, a Norman knight from southern Italy, and Robert II, Count of Flanders.
Following advice provided by Pope Urban, most of these armies set out in mid-summer and headed for Constantinople where they could expect assistance from Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Each travelled separately, since it was impossible for one region to feed and supply such large numbers on their own; the first to leave in spring 1096 was what became known as the People&#x27;s Crusade, an army of 20,000 low ranking knights and peasants which journeyed through the Rhineland, then headed for Hungary. Most of those from southern and northern France sailed from Brindisi across the Adriatic Sea, while Godfrey and his two brothers, leading an army from Lorraine reportedly 40,000 strong, set out in August 1096 following the route taken by the People&#x27;s Crusade.

Pope Urban II&#x27;s call for the crusade spurred a wave of violence against Jews across Europe, beginning with Rouen in December 1095. In the spring and early summer of 1096, members of the People&#x27;s Crusade plundered and massacred Jewish communities during the Rhineland massacres.

After the People&#x27;s Crusade entered Hungary in June, a series of incidents had culminated in a full-scale battle with their hosts and the deaths of over 10,000 Crusaders; as a result, when Godfrey and his troops approached the border in September, it took several days of negotiations before they were allowed in. He finally reached Constantinople in November, shortly after those led by Hugh of Vermandois while others arrived over the next few months. Unlike the limited numbers he had anticipated, by May 1097 Alexios found himself with over 4,000 to 8,000 mounted knights and 25,000 to 55,000 infantry camped on his doorstep. This mattered because the two sides had different goals; Alexius simply wanted help in retaking Byzantine lands lost to the Seljuk Turks, while the Crusaders sought to liberate the Holy Land from the Muslims. When Alexios demanded an oath of loyalty, Godfrey and most of the Crusaders agreed to a modified version in which they promised to restore some lands to the Emperor, Raymond of Toulouse being a notable exception: he would just promise to do the Emperor no harm.

===Capture of Nicaea and Antioch===

In February 1097, Godfrey and his army crossed the Bosporus Straits, where he was joined by Bohemund, Robert of Flanders and Hugh of Vermandois. Accompanied by Byzantine soldiers, in early May the Crusaders invested Nicaea, a city close to Constantinople captured by the Turks in 1085. Godfrey and his troops played a minor role, with Bohemond successfully commanding much of the action but as the Crusaders were about to storm the city, they noticed the Byzantine flag flying from the top of the walls. Wanting to minimise damage to what was an important Byzantine city and suspecting the Crusaders would demand a heavy ransom for handing it over, Alexios had made a separate peace with the Turkish garrison. Although the majority of the Crusader leaders accepted Alexios&#x27; right to do so, it was an illustration of the level of mutual suspicion between the two sides.

Godfrey continued to play a minor, yet significant, role in the battles against the Seljuks until the Crusaders finally reached Jerusalem in 1099. At Dorylaeum in July 1097, he helped relieve the vanguard at Dorylaeum which had been pinned down by a Turkish force under Kilij Arslan I, then sacked their camp. After this battle and during the trek through Asia Minor, some sources suggest that Godfrey was attacked by a bear and received a serious wound which incapacitated him for a time.

Godfrey also took part in the Siege of Antioch, which began in October 1097 and did not surrender until June 1098 after long and bitter fighting. During the winter, the crusading army came close to starvation and many returned to Europe, while Alexios assumed all was lost at Antioch and failed to provide them with supplies as promised. When the city finally fell, Bohemond claimed it for himself and refused to hand it over to the Emperor citing the Emperor&#x27;s failure to help the crusaders at Antioch as breaking the oath; after repulsing a Muslim force from Mosul led by Kerbogha, Antioch was secured.

===March on Jerusalem===
After this victory, the Crusaders were divided over their next course of action. The bishop of Le Puy had died at Antioch. Bohemond decided to remain behind in order to secure his new principality; and Godfrey&#x27;s younger brother, Baldwin, also decided to stay in the north in the Crusader state he had established at Edessa. Most of the foot soldiers wanted to continue south to Jerusalem, but Raymond IV of Toulouse, by this time the most powerful of the princes, having taken others into his employ, such as Tancred, hesitated to continue the march. After months of waiting, the common people on the crusade forced Raymond to march on to Jerusalem, and Godfrey quickly joined him. As they travelled south into Palestine, the Crusaders faced a new enemy. No longer were the Seljuk Turks the rulers of these lands. Now the Christian army had to deal with armies of North African Muslims called Fatimids, who had adopted the name of the ruling family in Cairo, Egypt. The Fatimids had taken Jerusalem in August 1098. The Crusaders would be battling them for the final prize of the First Crusade in the siege of Jerusalem.

It was in Jerusalem that the legend of Godfrey of Bouillon was born. The army reached the city in June 1099 and built a wooden siege tower (from lumber provided by some Italian sailors who intentionally scrapped their ships) to get over the walls. The major attack took place on 14 and 15 July 1099. Godfrey and some of his knights were the first to take the walls and enter the city. It was an end to three years of fighting by the Crusaders, but they had finally achieved what they had set out to do in 1096—to recapture the Holy Land and, in particular, the city of Jerusalem and its holy sites, such as the Holy Sepulchre, the empty tomb of Jesus Christ. Godfrey endowed the hospital in the Muristan after the First Crusade.

==Kingdom of Jerusalem==

Once the city was returned to Christian rule, some form of government had to be set up. On 22 July 1099, a council was held in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and after Raymond of Toulouse had refused the crown, Godfrey agreed to become ruler. However, he preferred the title Advocate of the Holy Sepulchre to that of king, allegedly refusing to &quot;wear a crown of gold where his Saviour had worn a crown of thorns. Both the meaning and usage of his title is disputed. Some of the original chroniclers used the more ambiguous term &quot;princeps&quot;, or his previous rank of duke. Later chroniclers who did not participate in the First Crusade suggest he took the title of &quot;rex&quot;, &quot;king&quot;.

During his short reign, Godfrey had to defend the new kingdom against the Fatimids of Egypt, who were defeated at the Battle of Ascalon in August. He also faced opposition from Dagobert of Pisa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who was allied with Tancred. Although the Latins came close to capturing Ascalon, Godfrey&#x27;s attempts to prevent Raymond of St. Gilles from securing the city for himself meant that the town remained in Muslim hands, destined to be a thorn in the new kingdom&#x27;s side for years to come.

In 1100, Godfrey was unable to directly expand his new territories through conquest. However, his impressive victory in 1099 and his subsequent campaigning in 1100 meant that he was able to force Acre, Ascalon, Arsuf, Jaffa, and Caesarea to become tributaries. Meanwhile, the struggle with Dagobert continued, although the terms of the conflict are difficult to trace. Dagobert may well have envisaged turning Jerusalem into a fiefdom of the pope, but his full intentions are not clear. Much of the evidence for this comes from William of Tyre, whose account of these events is troublesome; it is only William who tells us that Dagobert forced Godfrey to concede Jerusalem and Jaffa, while other writers such as Albert of Aachen and Ralph of Caen suggest that both Dagobert and his ally Tancred had sworn an oath to Godfrey to accept only one of his brothers or blood relations as his successor. Whatever Dagobert&#x27;s schemes, they were destined to come to naught. Being at Haifa at the time of Godfrey&#x27;s death, he could do nothing to stop Godfrey&#x27;s supporters, led by Warner of Grez, from seizing Jerusalem and demanding that Godfrey&#x27;s brother Baldwin should succeed to the rule. Dagobert was subsequently forced to crown Baldwin as the first Latin king of Jerusalem on 25 December 1100.

==Death==

The Arab chronicler Ibn al-Qalanisi reported that &quot;In this year [1099], Godfrey, lord of Jerusalem, appeared before the fortified port of &#x27;Akkā [Acre] and made an assault upon it, but was struck by an arrow, which killed him&quot;. While this claim is repeated in other Muslim sources, it does not appear in Christian chronicles; Albert of Aix and Ekkehard of Aura suggest Godfrey fell ill while visiting Caesarea in June 1100 and died in Jerusalem on 18 July.

Suggestions he was poisoned are unlikely and it is more probable he died from a disease similar to typhoid. Godfrey never married.

==Legacy==
According to William of Tyre, the later 12th-century chronicler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Godfrey was &quot;tall of stature, not extremely so, but still taller than the average man. He was strong beyond compare, with solidly-built limbs and a stalwart chest. His features were pleasing, his beard and hair of medium blond.&quot;

As the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and one of those who had taken part in its capture, Godfrey was idealized in later accounts. He was depicted as the military leader of the crusade, a legislator who established the assizes of Jerusalem, and in the early 14th century was selected as one of the Nine Worthies, a pantheon of famous warriors thought to epitomise chivalric ideals. In reality, Godfrey was only one of several leaders of the crusade, which also included Raymond IV of Toulouse, Bohemond of Taranto, Robert of Flanders, Stephen of Blois and Baldwin of Boulogne to name a few, along with papal legate Adhemar of Montiel, Bishop of Le Puy. Baldwin I of Jerusalem, Godfrey&#x27;s younger brother, became the first titled king when he succeeded Godfrey in 1100. The assizes were the result of a gradual development.

Godfrey&#x27;s role in the crusade was described by various authors, including Raymond of Aguilers and Albert of Aix, anonymous author of the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;. In fiction, he was the hero of the &quot;Crusade cycle&quot;, a collection of French &quot;chansons de geste&quot; dealing with the First Crusade, which connected him to the legend of the Knight of the Swan, most famous today as the storyline of Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Lohengrin&quot;.

By William of Tyre&#x27;s time later in the 12th century, Godfrey was already a legend among the descendants of the original crusaders. Godfrey was believed to have possessed immense physical strength; it was said that in Cilicia he wrestled a bear and won, and that he once beheaded a camel with one blow of his sword.
Since the mid-19th century, an equestrian statue of Godfrey of Bouillon has stood in the centre of the Place Royale/Koningsplein in Brussels, Belgium. It was made by Eugène Simonis, and inaugurated on 24 August 1848.

Godfrey is a key figure in the pseudohistorical theories put forth in the books &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; and &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.

In 2005 Godfrey came in 17th place in the French language &quot;Le plus grand Belge&quot;, a public vote of national heroes in Belgium. He did not make the 100 greatest Belgians, as voted by the Dutch speakers in &quot;De Grootste Belg&quot; (the Greatest Belgian).

===Literature and music===
* In the &quot;Paradiso&quot; segment of his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante Alighieri sees the spirit of Godfrey, together with Roland&#x27;s, in the Heaven of Mars with the other &quot;warriors of the faith&quot;.
* Pierre Desrey&#x27;s &quot;Genealogie de Godefroi de Buillon&quot;, completed in 1499, gives a complete history of the Crusades, starting with the birth of the &quot;Chevalier au Cygne&quot; (Knight of the Swan), the ancestor of Godfrey, and ending after the accession of Philip IV of France (1268–1314). At least six editions are preserved from the 16th century, published between 1504 and 1580.
* Torquato Tasso made Godfrey, as &quot;Goffredo di Buglione&quot;, the hero of his epic poem &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;.
* A Spanish play entitled &quot;La conquista de Jerusalén por Godofre de Bullón&quot; was written in the mid-1580s and known to have been performed in 1586. The play was discovered in the late 1980s by Stefano Arata. It is attributed to and is now widely accepted to have been written by Miguel de Cervantes. It is an adaptation of Tasso&#x27;s poem and features Godfrey as an ideal of Christian kingship, possibly as a critical parallel to King Philip II of Spain (1556–98).
* Godfrey is depicted in Georg Friedrich Händel&#x27;s opera &quot;Rinaldo&quot; (1711) as Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Goffredo&quot;.
* Godfrey also plays key roles in the following novels:
** &quot;The Blue Gonfalon&quot; by Margaret Ann Hubbard, which follows Godfrey and his men on their journey to the Holy Land. It is told through the eyes of Bennet, Godfrey&#x27;s squire.
** &quot;The Iron Lance&quot; by Stephen R. Lawhead
** &quot;Godfrey de Bouillon, Defender of the Holy Sepulchre&quot;, by Tom Tozer.
* Godfrey&#x27;s sword is given satirical mention in Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot; (1869).

<text>Thomas John Barnardo (4 July 184519 September 1905) was an Irish, Christian philanthropist and founder and director of homes for poor and deprived children. From the foundation of the first Barnardo&#x27;s home in 1867 to the date of Barnardo&#x27;s death, nearly 60,000 children had been taken in.

Although Barnardo never finished his studies at the London Hospital, he used the title of &#x27;doctor&#x27; and later secured a licentiate.

== Early life ==
Barnardo was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1845. He was the fourth of five children (one died in childbirth) of John Michaelis Barnardo, a furrier who was of Sephardic Jewish descent, and his second wife, Abigail, an English woman and member of the Plymouth Brethren.

Sometime before his first marriage in 1827 to Elizabeth O&#x27;Brien, John Michaelis emigrated from Prussia via Hamburg to Dublin, where he established a business; he married twice and fathered children with both wives. The Barnardo family &quot;traced its origin to Venice, followed by conversion to the Lutheran Church in the sixteenth century&quot;. Barnardo wrote that, as a child, he was selfish and thought that everything that was not his should belong to him. However, as he grew older, he abandoned this mindset in favour of helping people experiencing poverty.

Barnardo moved to London in 1866. It was during this time that he became interested in becoming a missionary.

== Philanthropy ==
Barnardo established &#x27;Hope Place&#x27; ragged school in the East End of London in 1868, his first attempt at aiding the estimated 30,000 &#x27;destitute&#x27; children in Victorian London. Many of these children were not only impoverished but orphaned, as the result of a recent cholera outbreak. For those unable to afford private education, the school offered education which although Christian-based, was not exclusively religion-focused, and worked to provide tutelage on various common trades of that time (for example, newsboys and shoe-shiners).

In 1870, Barnardo was prompted to form a boys&#x27; orphanage at 18 Stepney Causeway after inspecting the conditions within which London&#x27;s orphaned population slept. This was the first of 122 such establishments, caring for over 8,500 children, founded before he died in 1905. Significant provisions were available to occupants; infants/younger children were sent to rural districts in an attempt to protect them from industrial pollution, and teenagers were trained in skills such as carpentry and metal work, to provide them a form of basic financial stability.

Barnardo&#x27;s homes did not just accommodate boys; in 1876, the &#x27;Girls&#x27; Village Home&#x27; in Barkingside was established, and by 1905, accommodated 1,300 girls who were trained for &#x27;domestic occupation&#x27;. Another establishment, the &#x27;rescue home for girls in serious danger&#x27;, aimed to protect girls from the growing tide of child prostitution.

In addition to the various homes and schools established by Barnardo and his wife, Sara Louise Elmslie, a seaside retreat and hospital were also founded.

From the foundation of the homes in 1867 to Barnardo&#x27;s death, nearly 60,000 children had been taken in, most being trained and placed out in life. At his death, his charity cared for over 8,500 children in 96 homes.

==Personal life==
In June 1873, Barnardo married Sara Louise Elmslie (1842–1944), known as Syrie, the daughter of an underwriter for Lloyd&#x27;s of London. Syrie shared her husband&#x27;s interests in evangelism and social work. The couple settled at Mossford Lodge, Essex, where they had seven children, three of whom died in early childhood. A fourth child, Marjorie, had Down syndrome.

One daughter, Gwendolyn Maud Syrie (1879–1955), known as Syrie like her mother, was married to wealthy businessman Henry Wellcome, and later to the writer Somerset Maugham, and became a socially prominent London interior designer.

Barnardo died of angina pectoris in London on 19 September 1905, and was buried in front of Cairns House, Barkingside, Essex. The house is now the head office of the children&#x27;s charity he founded, Barnardo&#x27;s. A memorial stands outside Cairn&#x27;s House.

===Alleged Jack the Ripper suspect===
At the time of the Whitechapel murders, due to the supposed medical expertise of Jack the Ripper, various doctors in the area were suspected. Long after his death, Barnardo was named a possible suspect by Donald McCormick (1970) and Gary Rowlands (2005). Rowlands proposed that Barnardo&#x27;s lonely childhood and religious zeal led him to kill prostitutes to clear them from the streets and to encourage them to place their children into his care. Only because of an accident in a swimming pool that left him deaf shortly after murdering Mary Kelly did he stop killing, as being deaf left him more vulnerable to capture. 

There is no evidence that Barnardo committed the murders, and critics of this theory have also pointed out that his age and appearance did not match any of the descriptions of the Ripper. Barnardo was well known in the East End, however, and would visit cheap boarding houses to talk to underprivileged customers. During one of these visits, he spoke to a group at 32 Flower and Dean Street, Whitechapel, during the period of the murders. One of the women drunkenly cried, &#x27;We&#x27;re all up to no good and no-one cares what becomes of us; perhaps some of us will be killed next.&#x27; He later viewed the body of Elizabeth Stride, Jack the Ripper&#x27;s third canonical victim, at the mortuary and confirmed that she had been among those present.

==Legacy – Barnardo&#x27;s ==

After Barnardo&#x27;s death, a national memorial was instituted to form a fund of £250,000 to relieve the various institutions of all financial liability and permanently place the entire work. William Baker, formerly the chairman of the council, was selected to succeed the founder of the homes as honorary director. Barnardo was the author of 192 books dealing with the charitable work to which he devoted his life.

Barnardo&#x27;s work was carried on by his many supporters under the name &quot;Dr Barnardo&#x27;s Homes&quot;. Following societal changes in the mid-20th century, the charity changed its focus from the direct care of children to fostering and adoption, renaming itself &quot;Dr Barnardo&#x27;s&quot;. Following the closure of its last traditional orphanage in 1989, it took the still simpler name of &quot;Barnardo&#x27;s&quot;.

=== Controversies ===
There was controversy early on with Barnardo&#x27;s work. Specifically, he was accused of kidnapping children without their parents&#x27; permission and of falsifying photographs of children to make the distinction between the period before they were rescued by Barnardo&#x27;s and afterwards seem more dramatic. He openly admitted to the former of these charges, describing it as &#x27;philanthropic abduction&#x27; and basing his defence on the idea that the end justified the means. In total, he was taken to court on 88 occasions, usually on the charge of kidnapping. However, being a charismatic speaker and popular figure, he rode through these scandals unscathed. Other charges brought against him included presenting staged images of children for Barnardo&#x27;s &#x27;before and after&#x27; cards and neglecting basic hygiene for the children under his care.
=== The charity today ===
The official mascot of Barnardo&#x27;s is a bear called Barney. Queen Elizabeth II was Barnardo&#x27;s Patron from 1983 to 2016, when she handed over the role to The Duchess of Cornwall, who is now Queen Camilla. Its chief executive is Lynn Perry.

<text>Peter the Hermit ( 1050 – 8 July 1115 or 1131), also known as Little Peter, Peter of Amiens (fr. &quot;Pierre d&#x27;Amiens&quot;) or Peter of Achères (fr. &quot;Pierre d&#x27;Achères&quot;), was a Roman Catholic priest of Amiens and a key figure during the military expedition from France to Jerusalem, known as the People&#x27;s Crusade. Amongst Jews he is best remembered for the massacres of Jews that occurred under his leadership and the precedent they set for subsequent Crusades. He is by some called Blessed Peter the Hermit, although he has not been beatified in the Catholic Church.

==Family==
He is called Pierre l&#x27;Ermite in French. The structure of this name in French unlike in English has led some francophone scholars to treat l&#x27;Ermite as a surname rather than a title.

According to some authors, he was born around 1050 and was the son of Renauld L&#x27;Ermite of Auvergne, and his wife Alide Montaigu, de Picardie. Others claim he was a member of the &quot;L&#x27;Hermite&quot; family of Auvergne in the Netherlands. These claims are disputed by other authors, who argue that nothing can confirm that &quot;the Hermit&quot; was an actual surname and that surnames had not developed until after his day.

==Before 1096==
According to Anna Komnene&#x27;s &quot;Alexiad&quot; (1148), Peter attempted a pilgrimage to Jerusalem before 1096, but was prevented by the Seljuk Turks from reaching his goal and was reportedly mistreated. This experience caused him to preach inflammatory statements about the Turks to upset Christians. However, doubts remain whether he ever made such a journey.

Before the events of the first crusade, Peter the Hermit witnessed scenes that disturbed him during an earlier pilgrimage to Jerusalem. When he finally reached the Church of the Holy Sepulchre &quot;he saw many forbidden and wicked things occurring there… so he sought out the patriarch of the holy church of Jerusalem and asked why gentiles and evil men were able to pollute holy places and steal away offerings from the faithful, using the church as if a stable, beating up Christians, despoiling pilgrims through unjust fees, and inflicting on them many sufferings.&quot; The frustrated patriarch threw up his hands in exasperation: &quot;Why do you reprimand me and disturb me in the midst of my fatherly cares? I have but the strength and power of a tiny ant when compared to those proud men. We have to redeem our lives here by regular tribute payments (&quot;jizya&quot;) or else face death-dealing punishment&quot;.

Sources differ as to whether he was present at Pope Urban II&#x27;s Council of Clermont in 1095, where the Pope made his military strategy public. It is certain that he was one of the preachers of the armed pilgrimage in France afterwards, and his own experience may have helped to give fire to the Roman Catholic cause. Tradition in Huy holds that he was there when the call for war was announced and he began his preaching at once. He soon leapt into fame as an emotional revivalist, and the vast majority of sources and historians agree that thousands of serfs and peasants eagerly took the cross at his bidding, partly because of promises he did make.

This part of the First Crusade was also known as the Crusade of the Paupers. Peter organized and guided the paupers as a spiritually purified and holy group of pilgrims who would, supposedly, be protected by the Holy Ghost. Peter did not train his army, nor did he supply weapons or food. Some historians think it possible that the People&#x27;s Crusade also included well-armed soldiers and nobles. (A list of known participants in Peter&#x27;s army can be found at The Digital Humanities Institute.)

==Crusade to the Holy Land==
The leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Urban II, commissioned Peter to command an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Before Peter went on his military expedition he received permission from Patriarch Simeon II of Jerusalem. Peter was able to recruit from England, Lorraine, France, and Flanders. Peter the Hermit arrived in Cologne, Germany, on Holy Saturday, 12 April in 1096.

===Massacre of Jewish civilians===
In the spring of 1096 Peter was one of the prominent involved in the Rhineland massacres against Jews. Peter and his troops participated in the torture and slaughter of Jews in Lorraine, Cologne, Worms, Speyer and Mainz. In Mainz, Peter&#x27;s followers killed a large group of Jews that had been granted refuge by a local bishop in exchange for money. Death toll estimations vary from 2,000 - 2,800 civilians; some speak about 5,000 or even 10,000 people killed. These killings are known as &quot;Gzerot Tatnó&quot; (Hebrew: גזרות תתנ&quot;ו, Edicts of 4856). Another group had been led by the knight count Emicho of Leiningen who provoked the group to the massacres.

===Hungary, Belgrade, Sofia ===
Before reaching Constantinople, Peter and his followers began to experience difficulty. In Zemun, the governor, who was descendant of a Ghuzz Turk, and a colleague, were frightened by the army&#x27;s size and decided to tighten regulations on a frontier. This would have been fine if a dispute about the sale of a pair of shoes had not occurred. This led to a riot and against Peter&#x27;s wishes the town was attacked and the citadel was stormed. This resulted in 4000 Hungarians being killed and many provisions being stolen. Then on 26 June 1096 Peter&#x27;s army was able to cross the Sava river. Then the army marched into Belgrade, set the town on fire, and pillaged it. The army then made its way into and through Nish (Niš) after an eight-day delay. After riding through Nish, the Crusaders made their way towards Sofia, when they were attacked on the road by Byzantine soldiers. The Crusaders took heavy losses, losing a quarter of their army. They arrived in Sofia on 12 July nonetheless.

===Constantinople===
Leading the first of the five sections of the People&#x27;s Crusade to the destination of their pilgrimage, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, he started (with 40,000 men and women) from Cologne in April 1096, and arrived (with 30,000 men and women) at Constantinople at the end of July. Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos was less than pleased with their arrival, for along with the head of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Patriarch Nicholas III of Constantinople, he was now required to provide for the care and sustenance of the vast host of paupers for the remainder of their journey.

The forces then arrived in Constantinople on 1 August 1096. After a while, they arrived at a castle called Xerigordon and captured it. They captured the castle by taking possession of the castle&#x27;s spring and well. After setting off to Civetot, they had set up camp near a village called Dracon. This is where the Turks ambushed Peter and his forces. This was the final battle of the People&#x27;s Crusade that Peter led.

Most of the paupers failed to make their way out of Catholic jurisdiction. The majority were incapable of being provided for by the various lordships and dioceses along the way and either starved, returned home or were put into servitude, while a substantial number were captured and sold into slavery by the various Slavic robber barons in the Balkans, kindling the view of the Balkan Slavs as unredeemed robbers and villains.

Peter joined the only other section which had succeeded in reaching Constantinople, that of Walter Sans Avoir, into a single group and encamped the still numerous pilgrims around Constantinople while he negotiated the shipping of the People&#x27;s Crusade to the Holy Land. The Emperor meanwhile had failed to provide for the pilgrims adequately and the camp made itself a growing nuisance, as the increasingly hungry paupers turned to pilfering the imperial stores.

Alexios, worried at the growing disorder and fearful of his standing before the coming armed Crusader armies, quickly concluded negotiations and shipped them across the Bosporus to the Asiatic shore at the beginning of August, with promises of guards and passage through the Turkish lines. He warned the People&#x27;s Crusade to await his orders, but in spite of his warnings, the paupers entered Turkish territory. The Turks began skirmishing with the largely unarmed host. Peter returned in desperation to Constantinople, seeking the Emperor&#x27;s help.

In Peter&#x27;s absence, the pilgrims were ambushed and cut to pieces in detail by the Turks, who were more disciplined, at the Battle of Civetot. Despite Peter&#x27;s pronunciations of divine protection, the vast majority of the pilgrims were slaughtered by the swords and arrows of the Turks or were enslaved. Left in Constantinople with the small number of surviving followers, during the winter of 1096–1097, with little hope of securing Byzantine support, the People&#x27;s Crusade awaited the coming of the armed crusaders as their sole source of protection to complete the pilgrimage.

===To Jerusalem===
When the princes arrived, Peter joined their ranks as a member of the council in May 1097, and with the little following which remained they marched together through Asia Minor to Jerusalem. While his &quot;paupers&quot; never regained the numbers previous to the Battle of Civetot, his ranks were increasingly replenished with disarmed, injured, or bankrupted crusaders. Nonetheless, aside from a few rousing speeches to motivate the Crusaders, he played a subordinate part in the remaining history of the First Crusade which at this point clearly settled on a military campaign as the means to secure the pilgrimage routes and holy sites in Palestine.

Peter appears, at the beginning of 1098, as attempting to escape from the privations of the siege of Antioch—showing himself, as Guibert of Nogent says, a &quot;fallen star.&quot; Guibert and other sources go on to write that Peter was responsible for the speech before the half-starved and dead Crusaders which motivated their sally from the gates of Antioch and their subsequent victory over the overwhelmingly superior Muslim army besieging the city. Thus, having recovered his stature, in the middle of the year he was sent by the princes to invite Kerbogha to settle all differences via a duel, which the emir subsequently declined.

In 1099 Peter appears as the treasurer of the alms at the siege of Arqa, and as leader of the supplicatory processions around the walls of Jerusalem before it fell, and later within Jerusalem which preceded the Crusaders&#x27; surprising victory at the Battle of Ascalon (August). At the end of 1099, Peter went to Latakia, and sailed thence for the West. From this time he disappears from the historical record. Albert of Aix records that he died in 1131, as prior of a church of the Holy Sepulchre which he had founded in France.

==Role in preaching First Crusade==
Albert of Aix in his &quot;Historia Hierosolymitanae Expeditionis&quot; claims that Peter the Hermit was the true author and originator of the First Crusade. This story later appears in the pages of William of Tyre, which indicates that even a few generations after the crusade, the descendants of the crusaders believed Peter was its originator. This myth was dismissed by modern historians beginning with Heinrich von Sybel.&quot;&quot; Various historical sources also recount that during an early visit to Jerusalem sometime before 1096, Jesus appeared to Peter the Hermit in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and bade him preach the crusade. The origins of these legend is a matter of some interest. Von Sybel suggested that in the camp of the paupers (which existed side by side with that of the knights, and grew increasingly large as the crusade took a more and more heavy toll on the purses of the crusaders) some idolization of Peter the Hermit had already begun, parallel to the similar glorification of Godfrey of Bouillon by the Lorrainers.

==Later life==
There is very little concrete record for his life after returning to Europe and much of what is known is speculation or legend. However, Albert of Aix records that he died in 1131, as prior of a church of the Holy Sepulchre which he had founded in France or Flanders. It is thought that during the Siege of Antioch during the days of famine and cold weather, Peter attempted to flee only to be captured by the Norman Tancred and placed back on the battlefield in 1097. Peter also held services of intercession for Latin and native recruits. Peter advised Greeks and Latins to form processions as well.
It is generally quoted that he founded an Augustinian monastery in France named for the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. However, it was actually in Flanders at Neufmoustier near Huy, or Huy itself which may have been his home town. His tomb is in Neufmoustier Abbey, so it is presumed that this was his abbey but in another tradition the nearby Solières Abbey claims that it was his foundation.

Peter&#x27;s obituary is in the chronicle of Neufmoustier Abbey. On its page entry of 8 July 1115 the chronicle says that this day saw &quot;the death of Dom Pierre, of pious memory, venerable priest and hermit, who deserved to be appointed by the Lord to announce the first to the holy Cross&quot; and the text continues with &quot;after the conquest of the holy land, Pierre returned to his native country&quot; and also that &quot;he founded this church ... and chooses them a decent burial&quot;. This record further supports Neufmoustier&#x27;s claim as his foundation.

==Legend==

Since his death various legends have sprung up around Peter. One legend has its roots in the writings of Jacques de Vitry, who found it convenient to convince people from the bishopric of Liège of the merits of participating in the Albigensian Crusade by manipulating the story of Peter.

Another legend is given in the 14th century by the French troubadour Jehan-de-Bouteiller, who sings the memory of &quot;a dict Peter the Hermit deschendant a count of Clairmont by a Sieur d&#x27;Herrymont [who] married a Montagut&quot;. Peter the Hermit&#x27;s parents would, therefore, be Renauld de Hérimont and Aleidis Montaigu (Aleidis is known in Huy as the &quot;mother of Dom Pierre, with a home in Huy&quot;).

There is also a strong and old tradition that Peter the Hermit was the first to introduce the use of the Rosary. It follows that he began this tradition in about 1090.

<text>Albert of Aix(-la-Chapelle) or Albert of Aachen; ; &quot;fl.&quot; c. 1100) was a historian of the First Crusade and the early Kingdom of Jerusalem. He was born during the later part of the 11th century, and afterwards became canon (priest) and &quot;custos&quot; (guardian) of the church of Aachen.

Nothing else is known of his life except that he was the author of a &quot;Historia Hierosolymitanae expeditionis&quot; (“History of the Expedition to Jerusalem”), or &quot;Chronicon Hierosolymitanum de bello sacro&quot;, a work in Latin in twelve books, written between 1125 and 1150. This history begins at the time of the Council of Clermont in 1095, deals with the fortunes of the First Crusade and the earlier history of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, and ends somewhat abruptly in 1121.

The &quot;Historia&quot; was well known during the Middle Ages, and was largely used by William of Tyre for the first six books of his &quot;Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum&quot;. In modern times, it was accepted unreservedly for many years by most historians, including Edward Gibbon. In more recent times beginning with Heinrich von Sybel, its historical value has been seriously impugned, but the verdict of the best scholarship seems to be that in general it forms a true record of the events of the First Crusade, although containing some legendary matter.

Albert never visited the Holy Land, but he appears to have had a considerable amount of discourse with returned crusaders, and to have had access to valuable correspondence. Unlike many other chronicles of the First Crusade, Albert did not rely on the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;, but used his own independent interviews; he may also have had access to the &quot;Chanson d&#x27;Antioche&quot;, as his work shares textual similarities with that poem. The first edition of the history was published at Helmstedt in 1584, and a translation, with the original Latin, is in the &quot;Recueil des historiens des croisades&quot;, Volume 4.iii (1879). A modern edition in Latin and English translation by Susan B. Edgington is available in the Oxford Medieval Texts series. (cf. Volumes 24 and 25 of Crusader Texts in Translation.)

<text>The Wall Street crash of 1929, also known as the Great Crash, was a major stock market crash in the United States which began in late October 1929 with a sharp decline in prices on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and ended in mid-November. The crash began a rapid erosion of confidence in the U.S. banking system and marked the beginning of the worldwide Great Depression, which lasted until 1939; it is thus considered the most devastating in the country&#x27;s history. It is most associated with October 24, 1929, known as &quot;Black Thursday&quot;, when a record 12.9 million shares were traded on the NYSE in a single day (as compared to an average of four million), and October 29, 1929, known as &quot;Black Tuesday&quot;, when about 16.4 million shares were traded.

The &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot; of the previous decade had been a time of industrial expansion in the U.S., and much of the profit had been invested in speculation, including in stocks. Many members of the public, disappointed by the low interest rates offered on their bank deposits, committed their relatively small sums to stockbrokers. By 1929, the U.S. economy was showing signs of trouble; the agricultural sector was depressed due to overproduction and falling prices, forcing many farmers into debt, and consumer goods manufacturers also had unsellable output due to low wages and thus low purchasing power. Factory owners cut production and fired staff, reducing demand even further. Despite these trends, investors continued to buy shares in areas of the economy where output was declining and unemployment was increasing, so the purchase price of stocks greatly exceeded their real value.

By September 1929, more experienced shareholders realized that prices could not continue to rise and began to get rid of their holdings, which caused share values to stall and then fall, encouraging more to sell. As investors panicked, the selling became frenzied. After Black Thursday, leading bankers joined forces to purchase stock at prices above market value, a strategy used during the Panic of 1907. This encouraged a brief recovery before Black Tuesday. Further action failed to halt the fall, which continued until July 8, 1932; by then, the stock market had lost some 90% of its pre-crash value. The United States Congress responded to the events by passing the Banking Act of 1933 (Glass–Steagall Act), which separated commercial and investment banking. Stock exchanges introduced a practice of suspending trading when prices fell rapidly to limit panic selling. Scholars differ over the crash&#x27;s effect on the Great Depression, with some claiming that the price fluctuations were insufficient on their own to trigger a major collapse of the financial system, with others arguing that the crash, combined with the other economic problems in the U.S. at the end of the 1920s, should be jointly interpreted as a stage in the business cycles which affect all capitalist economies.

==Background==

The &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;, the decade following World War I that led to the crash, was a time of wealth and excess. Building on post-war optimism, rural Americans migrated to the cities in vast numbers throughout the decade with hopes of finding a more prosperous life in the ever-growing expansion of America&#x27;s industrial sector.

Scholars believe that declines in the money supply caused by Federal Reserve decisions had a severely contractionary effect on output. Despite the inherent risk of speculation, it was widely believed that the stock market would continue to rise forever. On March 25, 1929, after the Federal Reserve warned of excessive speculation, a small crash occurred as investors started to sell stocks at a rapid pace, exposing the market&#x27;s shaky foundation. Two days later, banker Charles E. Mitchell announced that his company, the National City Bank, would provide $25 million in credit to stop the market&#x27;s slide. Mitchell&#x27;s move brought a temporary halt to the financial crisis, and call money declined from 20 to eight percent. However, the American economy showed ominous signs of trouble. Steel production declined, construction was sluggish, automobile sales went down, and consumers were building up large debts because of easy credit.

Despite all the economic warning signs and the market breaks in March and May 1929, stocks resumed their advance in June, and the gains continued almost unabated until early September 1929 (the Dow Jones average gained more than 20% between June and September). The market had been on a nine-year run that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average increase in value tenfold, peaking at 381.17 on September 3, 1929. Shortly before the crash, economist Irving Fisher famously proclaimed &quot;Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau&quot;. The optimism and the financial gains of the great bull market were shaken after a well-publicized September 8 prediction from financial expert Roger Babson that &quot;a crash is coming, and it may be terrific&quot;. The initial September decline was thus called the &quot;Babson Break&quot; in the press. That was the start of the Great Crash, but until the severe phase of the crash in October, many investors regarded the September &quot;Babson Break&quot; as a &quot;healthy correction&quot; and buying opportunity.

On September 20, 1929, top British investor Clarence Hatry and many of his associates were jailed for fraud and forgery, leading to the suspension of his companies. This may have weakened the confidence of Americans in their own companies, although it had minimal impact on the London Stock Exchange. In the days leading up to the crash, the market was severely unstable. Periods of selling and high volumes were interspersed with brief periods of rising prices and recovery.

==Crash==
Selling intensified in mid-October. On October 24, &quot;Black Thursday&quot;, the market lost 11% of its value at the opening bell on very heavy trading. The huge volume meant that the report of prices on the ticker tape in brokerage offices around the nation was hours late, and so investors had no idea what most stocks were trading for. Several leading Wall Street bankers met to find a solution to the panic and chaos on the trading floor. The meeting included Thomas W. Lamont, acting head of Morgan Bank; Albert Wiggin, head of the Chase National Bank; and Charles E. Mitchell, president of the National City Bank of New York. They chose Richard Whitney, vice president of the Exchange, to act on their behalf.

With the bankers&#x27; financial resources behind him, Whitney placed a bid to purchase 25,000 shares of U.S. Steel at $205 per share, a price well above the current market. As traders watched, Whitney then placed similar bids on other &quot;blue chip&quot; stocks. The tactic was similar to one that had ended the Panic of 1907 and succeeded in halting the slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered, closing down only 6.38 points (2.09%) for the day.
On October 28, &quot;Black Monday&quot;, more investors facing margin calls decided to get out of the market, and the slide continued with a record loss in the Dow for the day of 38.33 points, or 12.82%.

On October 29, 1929, &quot;Black Tuesday&quot; hit Wall Street as investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Around $14 billion of stock value was lost, wiping out thousands of investors. The panic selling reached its peak with some stocks having no buyers at any price. The Dow lost an additional 30.57 points, or 11.73%, for a total drop of 68.90 points, or 23.05% in two days.

On October 29, William C. Durant joined with members of the Rockefeller family and other financial giants to buy large quantities of stocks to demonstrate to the public their confidence in the market, but their efforts failed to stop the large decline in prices. The massive volume of stocks traded that day made the ticker continue to run until about 7:45 p.m.

After a one-day recovery on October 30, when the Dow regained 28.40 points, or 12.34%, to close at 258.47, the market continued to fall, arriving at an interim bottom on November 13, 1929, with the Dow closing at 198.60. The market then recovered for several months, starting on November 14, with the Dow gaining 18.59 points to close at 217.28, and reaching a secondary closing peak (bear market rally) of 294.07 on April 17, 1930. The Dow then embarked on another, much longer, steady slide from April 1930 to July 8, 1932, when it closed at 41.22, its lowest level of the 20th century, concluding an 89.2% loss for the index in less than three years.

Beginning on March 15, 1933, and continuing through the rest of the 1930s, the Dow began to slowly regain the ground it had lost. The largest percentage increases of the Dow Jones occurred during the early and mid-1930s. In late 1937, there was a sharp dip in the stock market, but prices held well above the 1932 lows. The Dow Jones did not return to its peak close of September 3, 1929, for 25 years, until November 23, 1954.

==Aftermath==

In 1932, the Pecora Commission was established by the U.S. Senate to study the causes of the crash. The following year, the U.S. Congress passed the Glass–Steagall Act mandating a separation between commercial banks, which take deposits and extend loans, and investment banks, which underwrite, issue, and distribute stocks, bonds, and other securities.

Afterwards, stock markets around the world instituted measures to suspend trading in the event of rapid declines, claiming that the measures would prevent such panic sales. However, the one-day crash of Black Monday, October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.6%, as well as Black Monday of March 16, 2020 (−12.9%), were worse in percentage terms than any single day of the 1929 crash (although the combined 25% decline of October 28–29, 1929, was larger than that of October 19, 1987, and remains the worst two-day decline ).

==Analysis==
The crash followed a speculative boom that had taken hold in the late 1920s. During the latter half of the 1920s, steel production, building construction, retail turnover, automobiles registered, and even railway receipts advanced from record to record. The combined net profits of 536 manufacturing and trading companies showed an increase, in the first six months of 1929, of 36.6% over 1928, itself a record half-year. Iron and steel led the way with doubled gains. Such figures set up a crescendo of stock-exchange speculation that led hundreds of thousands of Americans to invest heavily in the stock market. Many people were borrowing money to buy more stocks. By August 1929, brokers were routinely lending small investors more than two-thirds of the face value of the stocks that they were buying. Over $8.5 billion was out on loan, more than the entire amount of currency circulating in the United States at the time.

The rising share prices encouraged more people to invest on the hope that share prices would rise further. Speculation thus fueled further rises and created an economic bubble. Because of margin buying, investors stood to lose large sums of money if the market turned down or even if it failed to advance quickly enough. The average price to earnings ratio of S&amp;P Composite stocks was 32.6 in September 1929, clearly above historical norms. According to the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, the exuberance also resulted in a large number of people placing their savings and money in leverage investment products like Goldman Sachs&#x27;s &quot;Blue Ridge trust&quot; and &quot;Shenandoah Trust&quot;, which crashed in 1929 as well, resulting in losses to banks of $475 billion in 2010 dollars ($ billion in ).
Good harvests had built up a mass of 250 million bushels of wheat to be &quot;carried over&quot; when 1929 opened. By May there was also a winter wheat crop of 560 million bushels ready for harvest in the Mississippi Valley. The oversupply caused such a drop in wheat prices that the net incomes of farmers from wheat were threatened with extinction. Stock markets are always sensitive to the future state of commodity markets, and the slump in Wall Street that had been predicted for May by Sir George Paish arrived on time. In June 1929, the position was saved by a severe drought in the Dakotas and the Canadian West, as well as unfavorable seed times in Argentina and eastern Australia. The oversupply was now wanted to fill the gaps in the 1929 world wheat production. From 97¢ per bushel in May, the price of wheat rose to $1.49 in July. When it was seen that figure would make American farmers get more for their crop that year than in 1928, stocks went up again.

In August, the wheat price fell when France and Italy were bragging about a magnificent harvest, and the situation in Australia improved. That sent a shiver through Wall Street and stock prices quickly dropped, but word of cheap stocks brought a fresh rush of &quot;stags&quot; (amateur speculators) and investors. Congress voted for a $100 million relief package for the farmers on the hope of stabilizing wheat prices, but by October, the price had fallen to $1.31 per bushel.

Other important economic barometers were also slowing or even falling by mid-1929, including car sales, house sales, and steel production. The falling commodity and industrial production may have dented even American self-confidence, and the stock market peaked on September 3 at 381.17 just after Labor Day, and it started to falter after Roger Babson issued his prescient &quot;market crash&quot; forecast. By the end of September, the market had dropped 10% from the peak (the &quot;Babson Break&quot;). Selling intensified in early and mid-October, with sharp down days punctuated by a few up days. Panic selling of massive proportion started the week of October 21 and intensified and culminated on October 24, October 28, and especially October 29 (&quot;Black Tuesday&quot;).

The president of the Chase National Bank, Albert H. Wiggin, said at the time: 
==Effects==
===United States===
Together, the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression formed the largest financial crisis of the 20th century. The panic of October 1929 has come to serve as a symbol of the economic contraction that gripped the world during the next decade. The falls in share prices on October 24 and 29, 1929 were practically instantaneous in all financial markets, except Japan.

The Wall Street Crash had a major impact on the U.S. and world economy, and it has been the source of intense academic historical, economic, and political debate from its aftermath until the present day. Some people believed that abuses by utility holding companies contributed to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. Many people blamed the crash on commercial banks that were too eager to put deposits at risk on the stock market.

In 1930, 1,352 banks held more than $853 million in deposits; in 1931, one year later, 2,294 banks failed with nearly $1.7 billion in deposits. Many businesses failed (28,285 failures and a daily rate of 133 in 1931).

The 1929 crash brought the Roaring Twenties to a halt. As tentatively expressed by economic historian Charles P. Kindleberger, in 1929, there was no lender of last resort effectively present, which, if it had existed and been properly exercised, would have been key in shortening the business slowdown that normally follows financial crises. The crash instigated widespread and long-lasting consequences for the United States. Historians still debate whether the 1929 crash sparked the Great Depression or if it merely coincided with bursting a loose credit-inspired economic bubble. Only 16% of American households were invested in the stock market within the United States during the period leading up to this depression, suggesting that the crash carried somewhat less weight in causing it.
However, the psychological effects of the crash reverberated across the nation as businesses became aware of the difficulties in securing capital market investments for new projects and expansions. Business uncertainty naturally affects job security for employees, and as the American worker (the consumer) faced uncertainty with regard to income, naturally the propensity to consume declined. The decline in stock prices caused bankruptcies and severe macroeconomic difficulties, including contraction of credit, business closures, firing of workers, bank failures, decline of the money supply, and other economically depressing events.

The resultant rise of mass unemployment is seen as a result of the crash, although the crash is by no means the sole event that contributed to the depression. The Wall Street Crash is usually seen as having the greatest impact on the events that followed and therefore is widely regarded as signaling the downward economic slide that initiated the Great Depression. True or not, the consequences were dire for almost everybody. Most academic experts agree on one aspect of the crash: It wiped out billions of dollars of wealth in one day, and this immediately depressed consumer buying.

The failure set off a worldwide run on US gold deposits (i.e., the dollar) and forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates into the slump. Some 4,000 banks and other lenders ultimately failed. Also, the uptick rule, which allowed short selling only when the last tick in a stock&#x27;s price was positive, was implemented after the 1929 market crash to prevent short sellers from driving the price of a stock down in a bear raid.

=== Europe ===
The stock market crash of October 1929 led directly to the Great Depression in Europe. When stocks plummeted on the New York Stock Exchange, the world noticed immediately. Although financial leaders in the United Kingdom, as in the United States, vastly underestimated the extent of the crisis that ensued, it soon became clear that the world&#x27;s economies were more interconnected than ever. The effects of the disruption to the global system of financing, trade, and production and the subsequent meltdown of the American economy were soon felt throughout Europe.

In 1930 and 1931, in particular, unemployed workers went on strike, demonstrated in public, and otherwise took direct action to call public attention to their plight. Within the UK, protests often focused on the so-called means test, which the government had instituted in 1931 to limit the amount of unemployment payments made to individuals and families. For working people, the means test seemed an intrusive and insensitive way to deal with the chronic and relentless deprivation caused by the economic crisis. The strikes were met forcefully, with police breaking up protests, arresting demonstrators, and charging them with crimes related to the violation of public order.

==Academic debate==
There is a debate among economists and historians as to what role the crash played in subsequent economic, social, and political events. &quot;The Economist&quot; argued in a 1998 article that the Depression did not start with the stock market crash, nor was it clear at the time of the crash that a depression was starting. They asked, &quot;Can a very serious Stock Exchange collapse produce a serious setback to industry when industrial production is for the most part in a healthy and balanced condition?&quot; They argued that there must be some setback, but there was not yet sufficient evidence to prove that it would be long or would necessarily produce a general industrial depression.

However, &quot;The Economist&quot; also cautioned that some bank failures were also to be expected and some banks may not have had any reserves left for financing commercial and industrial enterprises. It concluded that the position of the banks was the key to the situation, but what was going to happen could not have been foreseen.

Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot;, argues that what made the &quot;great contraction&quot; so severe was not the downturn in the business cycle, protectionism, or the 1929 stock market crash in themselves but the collapse of the banking system during three waves of panics from 1930 to 1933.

<doc id="157652" wikidata="Q2296042" url="?curid=157652" title="Subhuman Race">
<text>Subhuman Race (stylized sUBHUMAN rACE) is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Skid Row, released on March 28, 1995, by Atlantic Records. This is the last Skid Row album with singer Sebastian Bach and drummer Rob Affuso, and the last one to be released on Atlantic. Despite receiving positive reviews, &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; was not as successful as the band&#x27;s first two albums. Certain tracks from the album were remixed for the band&#x27;s compilation &quot;40 Seasons: The Best of Skid Row&quot;, given slightly cleaner mixes to fit better with the other tracks.

==Overview==
Released during the decline of hard rock and heavy metal, &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; marked a significant change in the band&#x27;s sound, with Bob Rock replacing Michael Wagener as its producer, and resembling a mixture of heavy metal with grunge, alternative, punk rock, thrash metal and groove metal influences. It has also been noted as more of a dark album than previous works.

To promote &quot;Subhuman Race&quot;, Skid Row supported Van Halen in North America on their &quot;Balance&quot; tour. Following the album and tour, they released a live EP titled &quot;Subhuman Beings on Tour&quot;, featuring live performances from the &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; tour. The band has not played any songs from &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; since the album&#x27;s tour in 1995–1996, though Bach has occasionally played them on his solo tours, including &quot;Beat Yourself Blind&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, and the singles &quot;My Enemy&quot;, &quot;Into Another&quot; and &quot;Breakin&#x27; Down&quot;. &quot;Beat Yourself Blind&quot; was the only song from this album to be performed live since Bach&#x27;s departure, until ZP Theart performed &quot;Medicine Jar&quot; in 2018, while &quot;Remains to Be Seen&quot; has never been played live once.

The album debuted at #35 on the Billboard 200, staying for nine weeks, being a significant drop off from &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;&#x27;s #1 debut. By July 1999, &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; has sold 165,424 copies, falling significantly behind their previous records.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Subhuman Race&quot; received mixed to mostly positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it saw the band &quot;strip back their music to the basics&quot; and was their &quot;strongest and most vicious record to date.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer called it &quot;the freshest riffage since last year&#x27;s Soundgarden record&quot; and also noted the &quot;tight, hot guitar lines and radio hooks that burn themselves into your brain&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; praised both the guitars that &quot;grumble and mutter more menacingly than ever&quot; and Bach&#x27;s &quot;awesome vocal pyrotechnics&quot;, summarizing that &quot;Skid Row has come up with an outright winner.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff found the album quite complex, with Skid Row &quot;absorbing the best elements of grunge into their over-the-top love of all things metal.&quot; He praised Bach&#x27;s performance and the band&#x27;s &quot;street-savvy&quot; attitude and &quot;prog ethic&quot; shown in the record. 

Conversely, Jim Farber of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considered &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; made of &quot;the same squealing, yowling, third-rate metal that made Skid Row pariahs in the first place&quot;, calling them an &quot;unrepentant hair band of the &#x27;80s&quot; which had mangled their melodies &quot;to get over their old &#x27;power ballad&#x27; stigma.&quot; Dean Golemis of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; criticised Skid Row&#x27;s &quot;campy, formulaic arrangements that still cater to commercial appeal and offer nothing new to a genre plagued by cliches and copycats&quot;, but remarked as &quot;Bach&#x27;s vocal bravura stands as the album&#x27;s saving grace.&quot; Thomas Kupfer in his review for the German &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;Skid Row will offend a lot of old fans with this disc&quot;, where &quot;mediocrity dominates, the songs seem uninspired, and only the compact sound and the solid craftsmanship of the band members&quot; save the album.

The band members also do not reflect positively on their work on &quot;Subhuman Race&quot;. In an interview in November 2006, bassist Rachel Bolan expressed his negative feelings about the album: &quot;That record was a nightmare. Internally the band had fallen apart but we were forced to go in and do another record and it was a nightmare with the recording, writing and producing. We worked with someone we had not worked with before after being so successful with Michael and we were used to the way he did things. I am not slighting Bob at all, he is a genius producer but it was bad timing. I did not have the greatest time, it was nobody&#x27;s fault, it was just the way things were. Also the record absolutely sucks.&quot; In a June 2018 interview on the &quot;Rock Talk with Mitch Lafon&quot; podcast, vocalist Sebastian Bach indicated that, despite featuring &quot;some good tunes&quot;, the &quot;very dated production sound&quot; of &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; has made it an unlistenable album: &quot;In the same way, probably, Lars Ulrich might think &quot;St. Anger&quot; is dated to that time, I think &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; might be our &quot;St. Anger&quot;.&quot;

<text>Anna Komnene (; 1 December 1083 – 1153), commonly Latinized as Anna Comnena, was a Byzantine Greek princess and historian. She is the author of the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, an account of the reign of her father, Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Her work constitutes the most important primary source of Byzantine history of the late 11th and early 12th centuries, as well as of the early Crusades. Although she is best known as the author of the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, Anna played an important part in the politics of the time and attempted to depose her brother, John II Komnenos, as emperor in favour of her husband, Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger.

At birth, Anna was betrothed to Constantine Doukas, and she grew up in his mother&#x27;s household. She was well-educated in &quot;Greek literature and history, philosophy, theology, mathematics, and medicine.&quot; Anna and Constantine were next in the line to throne until Anna&#x27;s younger brother, John II Komnenos, became the heir in 1092. Constantine died around 1094, and Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios in 1097. The two had several children before Nikephoros&#x27; death around 1136.

Following her father&#x27;s death in 1118, Anna and her mother attempted to usurp John II Komnenos. Her husband refused to cooperate with them, and the usurpation failed. As a result, John exiled Anna to the Kecharitomene Monastery, where she spent the rest of her life. In confinement there, she wrote the &quot;Alexiad&quot;.

==Early life and family==

Anna was born on 1 December 1083 to Alexios I Komnenos and Irene Doukaina. Her father, Alexios I Komnenos, became emperor in 1081, after usurping the previous Byzantine Emperor, Nikephoros Botaneiates. Her mother, Irene Doukaina, was part of the imperial Doukas family. In the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, Anna emphasises her affection for her parents in stating her relationship to Alexios and Irene. She was the eldest of seven children; her younger siblings were (in order) Maria, John II, Andronikos, Isaac, Eudokia, and Theodora.

Anna was born in the Porphyra Chamber of the imperial palace in Constantinople, making her a &quot;porphyrogenita,&quot; which underscored her imperial status. She noted this status in the &quot;Alexiad,&quot; stating that she was &quot;born and bred in the purple.&quot; According to Anna&#x27;s description in the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, her mother asked Anna to wait to be born until her father returned from war. Obediently, Anna waited until her father came home. 

At birth, Anna was betrothed to Constantine Doukas, the son of Emperor Michael VII and Maria of Alania. The two were the heirs to the empire until sometime between c.1088 and 1092, after the birth of Anna&#x27;s brother, John II Komnenos. Various scholars point out that the betrothal was probably a political match intended to establish the legitimacy of Anna&#x27;s father, who had usurped the previous emperor.

Starting around 1090, Constantine&#x27;s mother – Maria of Alania – raised Anna in her home. It was common in Byzantium for mothers-in-law to raise daughters-in-law. In 1094, Maria of Alania was implicated in an attempt to overthrow Alexios I Komnenos. Some scholars argue that Anna&#x27;s betrothal to Constantine Doukas may not have ended there, as he was not implicated in the plot against Alexios, but it certainly ended when he died around 1094.

Some scholars have also now started to look at Anna&#x27;s relationships to her mother-in-law Maria of Alania, her paternal grandmother Anna Dalassene, and her mother Irene Doukaina as sources of inspiration and admiration for Anna. For example, Thalia Gouma-Peterson argues that Irene Doukaina&#x27;s &quot;maternal ability to deal with the speculative and the intellectual enables the daughter to become the highly accomplished scholar she proudly claims to be in the opening pages of the &quot;Alexiad&quot;.&quot;

==Education==
Anna wrote at the beginning of the &quot;Alexiad&quot; about her education, highlighting her experience with literature, Greek language, rhetoric, and sciences. Tutors trained her in subjects that included astronomy, medicine, history, military affairs, geography, and mathematics. Anna was noted for her education by the medieval scholar, Niketas Choniates, who wrote that Anna &quot;was ardently devoted to philosophy, the queen of all sciences, and was educated in every field.&quot; Anna&#x27;s conception of her education is shown in her testament, which credited her parents for allowing her to obtain an education. This testament is in contrast to a funeral oration about Anna given by her contemporary, Georgios Tornikes. In his oration he said that she had to read ancient poetry, such as the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in secret because her parents disapproved of its dealing with polytheism and other &quot;dangerous exploits,&quot; which were considered &quot;dangerous&quot; for men and &quot;excessively insidious&quot; for women. Tornikes went on to say that Anna &quot;braced the weakness of her soul&quot; and studied the poetry &quot;taking care not to be detected by her parents.&quot;

Anna proved to be capable not only on an intellectual level but also in practical matters. Her father placed her in charge of a large hospital and orphanage that he built for her to administer in Constantinople. The hospital was said to hold beds for 10,000 patients and orphans. Anna taught medicine at the hospital, as well as at other hospitals and orphanages. She was considered an expert on gout. Anna treated her father during his final illness.

==Marriage==
In roughly 1097, Anna&#x27;s parents married her to &quot;Caesar&quot; Nikephoros Bryennios, a member of the Bryennios family that had held the throne before the accession of Anna&#x27;s father, Alexios I. Nikephoros was a soldier and a historian.

Most scholars agree that the marriage was a political one – it created legitimacy for Anna&#x27;s paternal family through Bryennios&#x27; connections to past emperor&#x27;s family. The two were an intellectual couple, and Nikephoros Bryennios tolerated and possibly encouraged Anna&#x27;s scholarly interests by allowing her to participate in various scholarly circles. The couple had six known children: Eirene, Maria, Alexios, John, Andronikos, and Constantine. Only Eirene, John, and Alexios survived to adulthood.

==Claim to the throne==

In 1087, Anna&#x27;s brother, John II, was born. Several years after his birth, in 1092, John was designated emperor. According to Choniates, Emperor Alexios &quot;favoured&quot; John and declared him emperor while the Empress Irene &quot;threw her full influence on [Anna&#x27;s] side&quot; and &quot;continually attempted&quot; to persuade the emperor to designate Nikephoros Bryennios, Anna&#x27;s husband, in John&#x27;s place. Around 1112, Alexios fell sick with rheumatism and could not move. He therefore turned the civil government over to his wife, Irene; she in turn directed the administration to Bryennios. Choniates states that, as Emperor Alexios lay dying in his imperial bedchamber, John arrived and &quot;secretly&quot; took the emperor&#x27;s ring from his father during an embrace &quot;as though in mourning.&quot; Anna also worked in her husband&#x27;s favour during her father&#x27;s illness. In 1118, Alexios I Komnenos died. A cleric acclaimed John emperor in Hagia Sophia.

According to Dion C. Smythe, Anna &quot;felt cheated&quot; because she &quot;should have inherited.&quot; Indeed, according to Anna Komnene in the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, at her birth she was presented with &quot;a crown and imperial diadem.&quot; Anna&#x27;s &quot;main aim&quot; in the depiction of events in the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, according to Vlada Stankovíc, was to &quot;stress her own right&quot; to the throne and &quot;precedence over her brother, John.&quot;

In view of this belief, Susan C. Jarratt et al. record that Anna was &quot;almost certainly&quot; involved in the murder plot against John at Alexios&#x27;s funeral. Indeed, Anna, according to Barbara Hill, attempted to create military forces to depose John. According to Choniates, Anna was &quot;stimulated by ambition and revenge&quot; to scheme for the murder of her brother. Smythe states the plots &quot;came to nothing.&quot; Jarratt et al., record that, a short time afterward, Anna and Bryennios &quot;organized another conspiracy.&quot; However, according to Hill, Bryennios refused to overthrow John, making Anna unable to continue with her plans. With this refusal, Anna, according to Choniates, exclaimed &quot;that nature had mistaken their sexes, for he ought to have been the woman.&quot; According to Jarratt et al., Anna shows &quot;a repetition of sexualized anger.&quot; Indeed, Smythe asserts that Anna&#x27;s goals were &quot;thwarted by the men in her life.&quot; Irene, however, according to Hill, had declined to participate in plans to revolt against an &quot;established&quot; emperor. Hill, however, points out that Choniates, whom the above sources draw upon, wrote after 1204, and accordingly was &quot;rather far removed&quot; from &quot;actual&quot; events and that his &quot;agenda&quot; was to &quot;look for the causes&quot; of the toppling of Constantinople in 1204.

In contrast, Leonora Neville argues that Anna was probably not involved in the attempted usurpation. Anna plays a minor role in most of the available medieval sources – only Choniates portrays her as a rebel. Choniates&#x27; history is from around 1204, almost a hundred years after Alexios I&#x27;s death. Instead, most of the sources question whether John II Komnenos&#x27; behaviour at his father&#x27;s deathbed was appropriate.

According to the account by Choniates (written after the Fourth Crusade), plots were discovered and Anna forfeited her estates. After her husband&#x27;s death, she entered the convent of Kecharitomene, which had been founded by her mother. She remained there until her death.

==Historian and intellectual==

In the seclusion of the monastery, Anna dedicated her time to studying philosophy and history. She held esteemed intellectual gatherings, including those dedicated to Aristotelian studies. Anna&#x27;s intellectual genius and breadth of knowledge is evident in her few works. Among other things, she was conversant with philosophy, literature, grammar, theology, astronomy, and medicine. It can be assumed because of minor errors that she may have quoted Homer and the Bible from memory when writing her most celebrated work, the &quot;Alexiad&quot;. Her contemporaries, like the metropolitan Bishop of Ephesus, Georgios Tornikes, regarded Anna as a person who had reached &quot;the highest summit of wisdom, both secular and divine.&quot;

== The &quot;Alexiad&quot; ==
Anna wrote the &quot;Alexiad&quot; in the mid-1140s or 1150s. Anna cited her husband&#x27;s unfinished work as the reason why she began the &quot;Alexiad&quot;. Before his death in 1137, her husband, Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger, was working on a history, which was supposed to record the events before and during the reign of Alexios I. His death left the history unfinished after recording the events of the reign of Emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates. Ruth Macrides argues that while Bryennios&#x27; writing may have been a source of inspiration for the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, it is incorrect to suggest that the &quot;Alexiad&quot; was Bryennios&#x27; work edited by Anna (as Howard-Johnston has argued on tenuous grounds).

In a statement on how she gathered her sources for the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, Anna wrote, &quot;My material ... has been gathered from insignificant writings, absolutely devoid of literary pretensions, and from old soldiers who were serving in the army at the time that my father seized the Roman sceptre ... I based the truth of my history on them by examining their narratives and comparing them with what I had written, and what they told me with what I had often heard, from my father in particular and from my uncles … From all these materials the whole fabric of my history – my true history – has been woven&quot;. Beyond just eyewitness accounts from veterans or her male family members, scholars have also noted that Anna used the imperial archives, which allowed her access to official documents.

In the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, Anna provided insight on political relations and wars between Alexios I and the West. She vividly described weaponry, tactics, and battles. It has been noted that she was writing about events that occurred when she was a child, so these are not eye-witness accounts. Her neutrality is compromised by the fact that she was writing to praise her father and denigrate his successors. Despite her unabashed partiality, her account of the First Crusade is of great value to history because it is the only Byzantine eyewitness account available. She had the opportunity to gather information from key figures in the Byzantine elite; her husband, Nikephorus Bryennios, had fought in the clash with crusade leader Godfrey of Bouillon outside Constantinople on Maundy Thursday 1097; and her uncle, George Palaeologos, was present at Pelekanon in June 1097 when Alexios I discussed future strategy with the crusaders. Thus, the &quot;Alexiad&quot; allows the events of the First Crusade to be seen from the Byzantine elite&#x27;s perspective. It conveys the alarm felt at the scale of the western European forces proceeding through the Empire, and the dangers they might have posed to the safety of Constantinople. 

Anna referred to the crusaders as &quot;Celts&quot;, reflecting old Greek terminology for western barbarians.

The &quot;Alexiad&quot; was written in Attic Greek, and the literary style is fashioned after Thucydides, Polybius, and Xenophon. Consequently, it exhibits a struggle for an Atticism characteristic of the period, whereby the resulting language is highly artificial. Peter Frankopan argues that the lapses in some of the chronology of events can in part be attributed to errors in, or lack of, source material for those events. Anna herself also addressed these lapses, explaining them as a result of memory loss and old age. But regardless of errors in chronology, her history meets the standards of her time.

Moreover, the &quot;Alexiad&quot; sheds light on Anna&#x27;s emotional turmoil, including her grief over the deaths of her father, mother, and husband, among other things. At the end of the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, Anna wrote &quot;But living I died a thousand deaths … Yet I am more grief-stricken than [Niobe]: after my misfortunes, great and terrible as they are, I am still alive – to experience yet more … Let this be the end of my history, then, lest as I write of these sad events I become even more resentful.&quot;

<doc id="157654" wikidata="Q4289" url="?curid=157654" title="Guibert of Nogent">
<text>Guibert de Nogent ( 1055 – 1124) was a Benedictine historian, theologian, and author of autobiographical memoirs. Guibert was relatively unknown in his own time, going virtually unmentioned by his contemporaries. He has only recently caught the attention of scholars who have been more interested in his extensive autobiographical memoirs and personality which provide insight into medieval life.

==Life==
Guibert was born of parents from the minor nobility at Clermont-en-Beauvaisis. Guibert claims that it took his parents over seven years to conceive, as he writes in his &quot;Monodiae&quot;. According to his memoirs, the labour nearly cost him and his mother their lives, as Guibert was a breech birth. Guibert&#x27;s family made an offering to a shrine of the Virgin Mary, and promised that if Guibert survived, he would be dedicated to a clerical life. Since he survived, he followed this path. His father was violent, unfaithful and prone to excess, and was captured at the Battle of Mortemer, dying eight months later. In his memoirs, Guibert views his death as a type of blessing, stating that if his father had survived, he likely would have forced Guibert to become a knight, thus breaking the oath to the Virgin Mary to dedicate Guibert to the church. His mother was domineering, of great beauty and intelligence, and exceedingly zealous. Guibert writes so much about his mother, and in such detail, that some scholars, such as Archambault, have suggested that he may have had an Oedipus complex. She assumed control of his education, isolated him from his peers and hired him a private tutor, from the ages of six to twelve. Guibert remembers the tutor as brutally exacting, and incompetent; nevertheless Guibert and his tutor developed a strong bond. When Guibert was around the age of twelve, his mother retired to an abbey near Saint-Germer-de-Fly (or Flay), and he soon followed. Entering the Order at St. Germer, he studied with great zeal, devoting himself at first to the secular poets Ovid and Virgil—an experience which left its imprint on his works. He later changed his focus to theology, through the influence of Anselm of Bec, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury.

In 1104, he was chosen abbot of the poor and tiny abbey of Nogent-sous-Coucy (founded 1059) and henceforth took a more prominent part in ecclesiastical affairs, where he came into contact with bishops and court society. More importantly, it gave him time to engage in his passion for writing. His first major work of this period is his history of the First Crusade called &quot;Dei gesta per Francos&quot; (God&#x27;s deeds through the Franks), finished in 1108 and touched up in 1121. The history is largely a paraphrase, in ornate style, of the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; of an anonymous Norman author; Crusade historians have traditionally not given it favourable reviews; the fact that he stays so close to &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;, and the difficulty of his Latin, make it seem superfluous. Recent editors and translators, however, have called attention to his excellent writing and original material. More importantly, the &quot;Dei gesta&quot; supplies us with invaluable information about the reception of the crusade in France. Guibert personally knew crusaders, had grown up with crusaders, and talked with them about their memories and experiences.

For the modern reader, his autobiography (&quot;De vita sua sive monodiarum suarum libri tres&quot;), or &quot;Monodiae&quot; (&quot;Solitary Songs&quot;, commonly referred to as his &quot;Memoirs&quot;), written in 1115, is considered the most interesting of his works. Written towards the close of his life, and based on the model of the &quot;Confessions&quot; of Saint Augustine, he traces his life from his childhood to adulthood. Throughout, he gives picturesque glimpses of his time and the customs of his country. The text is divided into three &quot;Books.&quot; The first covers his own life, from birth to adulthood; the second is a brief history of his monastery; the third is a description of an uprising in nearby Laon. He provides invaluable information on daily life in castles and monasteries, on the educational methods then in vogue, and gives insights into some of the major and minor personalities of his time. His work is coloured by his passions and prejudices, which add a personal touch to the work.

For example, he was quite skeptical about the propriety of Catholic relics of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and numerous Catholic saints, and entertained doubts about their authenticity, noting that some shrines and pilgrimage sites made conflicting claims about which bodily remnants, clothing or other sacred objects were held at which site but he did claim to have seen King Louis VI treating scrofula sufferers with his own eyes.

<text>Prunella Margaret Rumney West Scales (&quot;née&quot; Illingworth; born 22 June 1932) is an English retired actor. She portrayed Sybil Fawlty, the bossy wife of Basil Fawlty (John Cleese), in the BBC comedy &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; and Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;A Question of Attribution&quot; (&quot;Screen One&quot;, BBC 1991), for which she was nominated for a British Academy Television Award. She was also twice nominated at the Laurence Olivier Awards, in 1980 for &quot;Make and Break&quot; and in 1990 for &quot;Single Spies&quot;. Additionally, she appeared in the documentary series &quot;Great Canal Journeys&quot; (2014–2021), travelling on narrowboats with her husband and fellow actor Timothy West.

==Early life==
Scales was born in Sutton Abinger, Surrey, the daughter of John Richardson Illingworth, a cotton salesman who served as a lieutenant with the Wiltshire Regiment in the First World War, and with the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps in the Second World War, and Catherine, née Scales, known as &quot;Bim&quot;, an actress who had for a time attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and was later with the Liverpool Playhouse&#x27;s Repertory Company. Scales had a younger brother, Timothy &quot;Timmo&quot; Illingworth (1934–2017), who became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Irish Rangers and was appointed an OBE. In 1939, at the start of the Second World War, Scales&#x27;s parents moved with their children to Bucks Mills near Bideford in Devon. In 1942, Scales was awarded a scholarship to Moira House School which had been evacuated from Eastbourne to a hotel on Lake Windermere in the Lake District  Cumbria; her mother and brother accompanied her. Scales carried on her schooling when Moira House returned to Eastbourne. She was awarded a scholarship for the two year course at the Old Vic Theatre School in 1949; Moira House School had wished her to apply to Oxbridge.

==Career==
===Early works and career break===
Scales started her career in 1951 as an assistant stage manager at the Bristol Old Vic, but has stated that she has always wanted to be an actor. Throughout her career, she has often been cast in comic roles. Her early work included the (now believed to be lost) second UK adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1952), &quot;Laxdale Hall&quot; (1953), &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1954), &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; on Broadway (1955), &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (1959) and &quot;Waltz of the Toreadors&quot; (1962).

Her career break came with the early 1960s sitcom &quot;Marriage Lines&quot; starring opposite Richard Briers. She played her most famous role, Sybil Fawlty in the sitcom &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, over two series in 1975 and 1979. In addition to this, she has had roles in BBC Radio 4 sitcoms, and comedy series including &quot;After Henry&quot;, &quot;Smelling of Roses&quot; and &quot;Ladies of Letters&quot;; on television she starred in the London Weekend Television/Channel 4 series &quot;Mapp &amp; Lucia&quot; based on the novels by E. F. Benson. 

In 1973, Scales was cast with Ronnie Barker in &quot;One Man&#x27;s Meat&quot; which formed part of Barker&#x27;s &quot;Seven of One&quot; series, also for the BBC. Her later film appearances include &quot;Escape from the Dark&quot; (1976), &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1978), &quot;The Boys From Brazil&quot; (1978), &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1983), &quot;The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne&quot; (1987), &quot;Consuming Passions&quot; (1988), &quot;A Chorus of Disapproval&quot; (1989), &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992), &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994), &quot;An Awfully Big Adventure&quot; (1995) and &quot;Stiff Upper Lips&quot; (1997). For the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (1982) she played Mistress Page and in the &quot;Theatre Night&quot; series (BBC) she appeared with her husband Timothy West in the Joe Orton farce &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot; (1987) playing Mrs Prentice.

===1990s and onwards===
For 10 years, Scales appeared as &quot;Dotty&quot; Turnbull, together with Jane Horrocks as her character&#x27;s daughter, Kate Neall, in advertisements for UK supermarket chain Tesco. She played Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;A Question of Attribution&quot; (1991).In 1996, Scales starred in the television film &quot;Lord of Misrule&quot;, alongside Richard Wilson, Emily Mortimer and Stephen Moyer. The film was directed by Guy Jenkins and filming took place in Fowey in Cornwall. The same year, she appeared as Miss Bates in &quot;Emma&quot;, a TV-movie adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s novel of the same name. In 1997, Scales starred in Chris Barfoot&#x27;s science-fiction film short &quot;Phoenix&quot; which was first aired in 1999 by NBCUniversal&#x27;s Sci-Fi Channel. Scales played The Client, an evil government minister funding inter-genetic time travel experiments. The same year, she played Minny Stinkler in the comedy film &quot;Mad Cows&quot;, directed by Sara Sugarman. In 1993, Scales voiced Mrs Tiggy-Winkle in &quot;The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends&quot;.

In 2000, Scales appeared in the film &quot;The Ghost of Greville Lodge&quot; as Sarah. The same year, she appeared as Eleanor Bunsall in &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;″ &quot;Beyond the Grave&quot;. In 2001, she appeared in two episodes of &quot;Silent Witness&quot;″ &quot;Faith&quot; as Mrs Parker. In 2003, she appeared as Hilda, &quot;she who must be obeyed&quot;, wife of Horace Rumpole, in four BBC Radio 4 plays, with Timothy West playing her fictional husband. Scales and West toured Australia at the same time in different productions. Scales appeared in a one-woman show called &quot;An Evening with Queen Victoria&quot;, which also featured the tenor Ian Partridge singing songs written by Prince Albert. Scales has performed &quot;An Evening with Queen Victoria&quot; more than 400 times, in theatres around the world, over the course of 30 years.

Scales voiced the speaking (&quot;cawing&quot;) role of Magpie, the eponymous thief in a 2003 recording of Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; (&quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot;).

In 2006, Scales appeared alongside Academy Award winners Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell in the mini-series &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot;.

===Later years===
On 16 November 2007, Scales appeared in &quot;Children in Need&quot;, reprising her role as Sybil Fawlty, the new manager who wants to take over Hotel Babylon. John Cleese said in an interview on 8 May 2009 that the role of Sybil Fawlty was originally offered to Bridget Turner, who turned down the part, claiming &quot;it wasn&#x27;t right for her&quot;.

Scales appeared in the audio play &quot;The Youth of Old Age&quot;, produced in 2008 by the Wireless Theatre Company, and available to download free of charge on their website. In 2008, she appeared in &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple&quot; &quot;A Pocket Full of Rye&quot; as Mrs Mackenzie.

Scales appeared in a production of &quot;Carrie&#x27;s War&quot;, the Nina Bawden novel, at the West End Apollo Theatre in 2009. The run was successful despite middling reviews. However, Ben Bradley, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; Arts &amp; Beats, stated that Scales was the most memorable thing about the show, &quot;[playing] a rich, Miss Havisham-like eccentric, who trails through her house in evening gowns&quot;.

Scales starred in the 2011 British live-action 3D family comedy film &quot;Horrid Henry: The Movie&quot; as the titular character&#x27;s Great Aunt Greta. She appeared in a short audio story, &quot;Dandruff Hits the Turtleneck&quot;, written by John Mayfield, and available for download. Scales starred in a short film called &quot;Stranger Danger&quot; alongside Roderick Cowie in 2012. In 2013 she made a guest appearance in the popular BBC radio comedy &quot;Cabin Pressure&quot; as Wendy Crieff, the mother of Captain Martin Crieff.

Alongside her husband, Scales appeared in &quot;Great Canal Journeys&quot; for Channel 4 from 2014 for 10 series, before her deteriorating health brought her television career to an end. Stuart Heritage, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in November 2016, commented that it &quot;is ultimately a work about a devoted couple facing something huge together. It&#x27;s a beautiful, meditative programme&quot;. &quot;An emotional but unrooted glimpse of life with dementia&quot; was Christopher Howse&#x27;s characterization in October 2018, writing for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;. Reviewing Scales&#x27;s and West&#x27;s last episode in October 2019 for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Jack Seale wrote &quot;Since the first instalment in 2014, the series has charted the long, slow goodbye that is living with dementia, cherishing every moment of precious normality and celebrating how an immersion in nature is the surest way to bring the old Pru back.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1992, Scales appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, a programme where guests are asked to decide which one book, luxury item, and eight audio recordings they would want with them should they be stranded on a deserted island. Her chosen books were the &quot;Complete Works of Shakespeare&quot; in German, the Bible in Russian and a Russian dictionary; her luxury item was &quot;a huge tapestry kit&quot;.

Her biography, &quot;Prunella&quot;, written by Teresa Ransom, was published by UK publishing imprint John Murray in 2005.

In 2005, Scales named the P&amp;O cruise ship &quot;Artemis&quot;.

A rose-breeder created a rose, &quot;Prunella&quot;, in her honour.

She is a patron of the Lace Market Theatre in Nottingham.

===Family===
Scales was married to the actor Timothy West from 1963 until his death in 2024. They had two sons; the elder is actor and director Samuel West. Their younger son Joseph (Joe) participated in two episodes of &quot;Great Canal Journeys&quot;, filmed in France. Scales also has a step-daughter, by West&#x27;s first marriage.

===Charity work===
From 1997 until 2002, Scales was president of CPRE, at that time known as the Council for the Protection of Rural England.

===Illness===
Scales&#x27;s husband first noticed that she was having minor difficulties when she was performing in a play in 2001. She was eventually diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2014. The diagnosis did not prevent her from taking part in &quot;Great Canal Journeys&quot;, in which she and her husband spoke openly about her illness. Her declining health led the couple to leave the series in 2019. Interviewed for the BBC in 2023, soon after celebrating their diamond wedding anniversary, West said, with reference to Scales&#x27;s dementia: &quot;Somehow we have coped with it and Pru doesn&#x27;t really think about it.&quot;

==Honours==
In 1999, Scales was awarded the Freedom of the City of London. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours List; her husband had received the same honour in the 1984 Birthday Honours List. In 1999, she was awarded a D.Litt. honorary degree by the University of Bradford and, in 2000, by the University of East Anglia.

<text>The Battle of Magenta was fought on 4 June 1859 near the town of Magenta in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, a crown land of the Austrian Empire, during the Second Italian War of Independence. It resulted in a French-Sardinian victory under Napoleon III against the Austrians under Marshal Ferenc Gyulay.

Napoleon III&#x27;s army crossed the Ticino River and outflanked the Austrian right forcing the Austrian army under Gyulay to retreat. The confined nature of the country, a vast spread of orchards cut up by streams and irrigation canals, precluded elaborate manoeuvre. The Austrians turned every house into a miniature fortress. The brunt of the fighting was borne by 5,000 grenadiers of the French Imperial Guard, still mostly in their First Empire style of uniforms. The battle of Magenta was not a particularly large battle, but it was a decisive victory for the Franco-Sardinian alliance. Patrice de MacMahon was created Duke of Magenta for his role in this battle, and would later go on to serve as President of the French Third Republic.

==Prelude to Battle==
From 1 June through 3 June, the French and Piedmontese pursued the Austrian 2nd Army to the Ticino River, the border between Lombardy and Piedmont. The Austrians set up a defensive position at Magenta, utilizing the Naviglio Grande, which could be crossed only at four bridges. Gyulay had available 68,000 men, composed of the I,II, III and VII Korps. The French had about 50,000 men, while Manfredo Fanti added another 12,000. Camou had crossed the Ticino during the Battle of Turbigo, followed by MacMahon. MacMahon, Camou and Espinasse crossed the canal on bridges at Bernate Ticino and Boffalora sopra Ticino, placing them north of Magenta.

==Battle==
At noon, MacMahon encountered elements of Liechtenstein&#x27;s II Korps. The Imperial Guard Corps made contact with the Austrians from Buffalora to Magenta. At 2pm, the Guard Zouaves crossed the canal with boats, establishing a bridgehead. Eduard Clam-Gallas informed Gyulay of the French attack, who sent Schwarzenberg&#x27;s III Korps from Robecco sul Naviglio, threatening the French right flank. Canrobert arrived in time to reinforce the Guard. From 3.30 through 5.30pm, MacMahon launched an attack against the Austrian I and II Korps. By 6.30pm the Austrians began a fighting withdrawal, while the French advanced into Magenta and beyond. By 10pm, the Austrian 2nd Army was withdrawing toward Abbiategrasso.

==Aftermath==
On 8 June, Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel II entered Milan, then Brescia a few days later. On 23–25 May, Prince Napoléon Bonaparte&#x27;s V Corps landed at Livorno, and then entered Florence a week later, followed by Parma, and Modena. 

According to Frederick Schneid, &quot;The defeat at Magenta spelled the end for Gyulay. He withdrew his army to the Chiese River east of Milan, and resigned on June 16.&quot;

== Legacy ==
A dye producing the colour magenta was discovered in 1859, and was named after this battle, as was the Boulevard de Magenta in Paris.

<doc id="157657" wikidata="Q952036" url="?curid=157657" title="Armillaria">
<text>Armillaria is a genus of fungi that includes the &quot;A. mellea&quot; species known as honey fungi that live on trees and woody shrubs. It includes about 10 species formerly categorized summarily as &quot;A. mellea&quot;. &quot;Armillarias&quot; are long-lived and form the largest living fungi in the world. The largest known organism (of the species &quot;Armillaria ostoyae&quot;) covers more than in Oregon&#x27;s Malheur National Forest and is estimated to be 2,500 years old. Some species of &quot;Armillaria&quot; display bioluminescence, resulting in foxfire.

&quot;Armillaria&quot; can be a destructive forest pathogen. It causes &quot;white rot&quot; root disease (see Plant pathology section) of forests, which distinguishes it from &quot;Tricholoma&quot;, a mycorrhizal (non-parasitic) genus. Because &quot;Armillaria&quot; is a facultative saprophyte, it also feeds on dead plant material, allowing it to kill its host, unlike parasites that must moderate their growth to avoid host death.

== Description ==

The basidiocarp (reproductive structure) of the fungus is a mushroom that grows on wood, typically in small dense clumps or tufts. Their caps (mushroom tops) are typically yellow-brown, somewhat sticky to touch when moist, and, depending on age, may range in shape from to to depressed in the center. The stipe (stalk) may or may not have a ring. All &quot;Armillaria&quot; species have a white spore print and none have a volva (cup at base) (compare &quot;Amanita&quot;).

Similar species include &quot;Pholiota&quot; spp. which also grow in cespitose (mat-like) clusters on wood and fruit in the fall. &quot;Pholiota&quot; spp. are separated from Armillaria by its yellowish to greenish-yellow tone and a dark brown to grey-brown spore print. Mushroom hunters need to be wary of &quot;Galerina &quot; spp. which can grow side by side with &quot;Armillaria&quot; spp. on wood. &quot;Galerina&quot; have a dark brown spore print and are deadly poisonous (alpha-amanitin) – see: mushroom poisoning.

== Fungus pathology ==
Honey fungus is a &quot;white rot&quot; fungus, which is a pathogenic organism that affects trees, shrubs, woody climbers and rarely, woody herbaceous perennial plants. Honey fungus can grow on living, decaying, and dead plant material.

Honey fungus spreads from living trees, dead and live roots and stumps by means of reddish-brown to black rhizomorphs (root-like structures) at the rate of approximately a year, but infection by root contact is possible. Infection by spores is rare. Rhizomorphs grow close to the soil surface (in the top ) and invade new roots, or the root collar (where the roots meet the stem) of plants. An infected tree will die once the fungus has girdled it, or when significant root damage has occurred. Additionally, Infections can occur through the activity of wood boring beetles. For example, &quot;Agrilus biguttatus&quot; most commonly girdle in oak trees, which allows fungi to grow in the stems of these infected trees. This can happen rapidly, or may take several years. Infected plants will deteriorate, although may exhibit prolific flower or fruit production shortly before death.

Initial symptoms of honey fungus infection include dieback or shortage of leaves in spring. Rhizomorphs (also called mycelial cords) appear under the bark and around the tree, and mushrooms grow in clusters from the infected plant in autumn and die back after the first frost. However these symptoms and signs do not necessarily mean that the pathogenic strains of honey fungus are the cause, so other identification methods are advised before diagnosis. Thin sheets of cream colored mycelium, beneath the bark at the base of the trunk or stem indicated that honey fungus is likely the pathogen. It will give off a strong mushroom scent and the mushrooms sometimes extend upward. On conifers honey fungus often exudes a gum or resin from cracks in the bark.

==Taxonomy==
The name &quot;Armillaria&quot; was defined in 1821 by Fries, but at that time most gilled mushrooms were considered to belong to genus &quot;Agaricus&quot; and &quot;Armillaria&quot; was only a subgenus (a &quot;tribe&quot;). It was only in 1857 that Friedrich Staude created it as a genus in its own right.

The linkage of morphological, genetic, and molecular characters of &quot;Armillaria&quot; over the past few decades has led to the recognition of intersterile groups designated as &quot;biological species&quot;. Data from such studies, especially those using molecular diagnostic tools, have removed much uncertainty for mycologists and forest pathologists. New questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of North American &quot;Armillaria&quot; species and their relationships to their European counterparts, particularly within the &quot;&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; complex&quot;. Some data suggest that North American and European &quot;A. gallica&quot; isolates are not monophyletic. Although North American and European isolates of &quot;A. gallica&quot; may be interfertile, some North American isolates of &quot;A. gallica&quot; are more closely related to the North American taxon &quot;A. calvescens&quot; than to European isolates of &quot;A. gallica&quot;. The increase in genetic divergence has not necessarily barred inter-sterility between isolated populations of &quot;A. gallica&quot;. Although the relationships among some groups in the genus seem clearer, the investigation of geographically diverse isolates has revealed that the relationship between some North American species is still unclear (Hughes et al. 2003).

Intersterile species of &quot;Armillaria&quot; occurring in North America (North American Biological Species = NABS) were listed by Mallett (1992):

* I &quot;Armillaria ostoyae&quot; (Romagn.) Herink
* II &quot;Armillaria gemina&quot; Bérubé &amp; Dessureault
* III &quot;Armillaria calvescens&quot; Bérubé &amp; Dessureault
* V &quot;Armillaria sinapina&quot; Bérubé &amp; Dessureault
* VI &quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; (Vahl.:Fries) Kummer
* VII &quot;Armillaria gallica&quot; (Marxmüller &amp; Romagn.)
* IX &quot;Armillaria nabsnona&quot; T. J. Volk &amp; Burds. (1996)
* X &quot;Armillaria altimontana&quot; Brazee, B. Ortiz, Banik &amp; D. L. Lindner (2012)
* XI taxonomically undescribed

NABS I, V, VII, IX, X, and XI have been found in British Columbia; I, III, V have been found in the Prairie Provinces, with I and V occurring in both the boreal and subalpine regions; I, III, V, and VII have been found in Ontario; and I, II, III, V, and VI have been found in Quebec. &quot;Armillaria ostoyae&quot; is the species most commonly found in all Canadian provinces surveyed (Mallett 1990). &quot;Armillaria&quot; root rot occurs in the Northwest Territories, and was identified on white spruce at Pine Point on Great Slave Lake prior to NABS findings.

In 1791 Albrecht Wilhelm Roth described the species &quot;Rhizomorpha fragilis&quot; for a collection which consisted entirely of rhizomorphs. The genus &quot;Rhizomorpha&quot; thus became established and later these mycelial cords were shown to belong to &quot;Armillaria mellea&quot;. According to the code of nomenclature that means that the two genus names are synonyms and since genus &quot;Armillaria&quot; was not defined until 1857, the name &quot;Rhizomorpha&quot; takes precedence and should replace the name &quot;Armillaria&quot;. To avoid this a 2021 paper by Stalpers et al. proposes that the name &quot;Armillaria&quot; should be protected. However the proposal awaits decisions by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi and eventually by an International Botanical Congress.

== Edibility ==

Honey fungus are regarded in Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Germany and other European countries as one of the best wild mushrooms. They are commonly ranked above morels and chanterelles and only the cep/porcini is more highly prized. However, honey fungus must be thoroughly cooked as they are mildly poisonous raw. Honey mushrooms are one of four UK species that can cause sickness when ingested with alcohol. For those unfamiliar with the species, it is advisable not to drink alcohol for 12 hours before and 24 hours after eating this mushroom to avoid any possible nausea and vomiting. However, if these rules are followed, this variety of mushroom is a delicacy with a distinctive mushroomy and nutty flavour. Reference texts for identification are &quot;Collins Complete British Mushrooms and Toadstools&quot; for the variety of field pictures in it, and Roger Philips&#x27; &quot;Mushrooms&quot; for the quality of his out of field pictures and descriptions.

In Norway, some mycologists have started to regard honey fungus as poisonous, as the Norwegian health ministry is moving away from the parboiling practice.

==Hosts==

Potential hosts include conifers and various monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species, ranging from asparagus and strawberry to large forest trees (Patton and Vasquez Bravo 1967). &quot;Armillaria&quot; root rot enters hosts through the roots. In Alberta, 75% of trap logs (Mallett and Hiratsuka 1985) inserted into the soil between planted spruce became infected with the distinctive white mycelium of &quot;Armillaria&quot; within one year. Of the infestations, 12% were &quot;A. ostoyae&quot;, and 88% were &quot;A. sinapina&quot; (Blenis et al. 1995). Reviews of the biology, diversity, pathology, and control of &quot;Armillaria&quot; in Fox (2000) are useful.

<doc id="157658" wikidata="Q889601" url="?curid=157658" title="Specific replant disease">
<text>Specific replant disease (also known as sick soil syndrome) is a malady that manifests itself when susceptible plants such as apples, pears, plums, cherries and roses are placed into soil previously occupied by a related species. The exact causes are not known, but in the first year the new plants will grow poorly. Root systems are weak and may become blackened, and plants may fail to establish properly.

One theory is that replant disease is due to a whole menagerie of tree pathogens — fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses and other organisms. These parasites target the living tissues of the mature tree, hastening senility and death, and survive in the soil and decaying roots after the tree has died. Putting a young traumatized tree with an immature root system into this broth of pathogens can be too much for an infant tree to cope with. Any new root growth is rapidly and heavily colonized, so that shoot growth is virtually zero. This is especially true if it is on a dwarfing rootstock, which by its nature will be relatively inefficient. As a rule, replant disease persists for around fifteen years in the soil, although this varies with local conditions. Pathogens survive in dead wood and organic matter until exposed to predation by their home rotting away, and will also depend on whether the original orchard was planted with dwarf or standard trees. Standards have more vigorous therefore larger - roots, and are thus likely to take longer to degrade.

It is good organic rotation practice not to follow &quot;like with like&quot; and this rule applies to long lived trees as much as annual vegetables. In the case of temperate fruit trees, the &quot;pomes and stones&quot; rule for rotation should be observed- don&#x27;t follow a &quot;pome&quot; fruit (with an apple-type core—apples, pears, medlar, quince) with a tree from the same group. A &quot;stone&quot; fruit (i.e., with a plum-type stone, such as plum, cherry, peach, apricot, almond) should be all right, and vice versa. However, rotation is not always easy in a well planned old orchard when the site it occupies may well be the best available, and starting another orchard elsewhere may not be practical. In this case, and replanting is unavoidable, a large hole should be dug out, and the soil removed and replaced with clean soil from a site where susceptible plants have not been grown.

Using trees on vigorous rootstocks which will have a better chance of competing with the pathogens, or plants grown in large containers with a large root ball may also have a better chance of resisting replant disease. The extra time to cropping may be offset if new trees are planted a few years in advance of old trees finally falling over, furthermore, if the old orchard was grubbed— i.e. trees were healthy when removed, it is unlikely that replant disease would be a problem as pathogen levels may never have been high. The malady is worse where trees have died in situ-pathogens are likely to have contributed to the death and therefore be at a higher level in the soil.

Soil fumigation is another common method employed to control replant disease in both apple and cherry trees. Throughout the 1990s, fumigants like methyl bromide (bromomethane) were commonly used in this way to control and treat the disease, through this was later phased out in the 2000s in favour of more modern alternatives such as chloropicrin, which some studies have shown to be an effective method for resolving SARD in apple tree monoculture in Europe.

<text>Rachel Bolan (born February 9, 1964), born James Richard Southworth, is an American musician, best known as the bassist and main songwriter of the metal band Skid Row.

==Career==
Bolan was born in 1964 to Aida and Hubert Southworth. He grew up in Toms River, New Jersey. The youngest of four children, Bolan is half Portuguese. When he was in junior high school he began considering a career in music after drummer Damian Cordisco asked him to play bass in his band. Bolan&#x27;s first gig was in 1978 at Manasquan High School. Bolan credits Cordisco with opening his ears to music he had not heard, by artists such as Ramones, AC/DC, Joe Jackson, Sex Pistols, the Cars and Elvis Costello. Bolan graduated from Toms River High School East in 1982.

His stage name &#x27;Rachel&#x27; is a hybrid of his brother&#x27;s name, Richard, and his grandfather&#x27;s name, Manuel. &#x27;Bolan&#x27; is a tribute to one of his childhood idols, T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan. In 1990, Bolan legally changed his name to Rachel Bolan Southworth. 

After high school, Bolan joined with Scotti Hill and other musicians to form a band named Godsend. In 1986, guitarist Dave &quot;The Snake&quot; Sabo was forming the band Darkness, and he brought Hill and Bolan into the band. They changed the band name to Skid Row in late 1986. 

Bolan has appeared as a vocalist on two of Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley&#x27;s solo albums and back-up vocals on Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; album. He has produced numerous bands including Rockets to Ruin, the Luchagors in 2007 with former wrestler Amy &quot;Lita&quot; Dumas and Atlantic Records stoner metal band Godspeed. He formed the band with Solace guitarist Tommy Southard and L. Wood. Prunella Scales released &quot;&quot; on Mutiny Records in 1997. Jack Roberts (guitar) and Ray Kubian (drums), both from the New Jersey–based band Mars Needs Women, joined Prunella Scales for touring. He played the bass guitar for Stone Sour on the band&#x27;s records &quot;House of Gold &amp; Bones - Part 1&quot; and &quot;House of Gold &amp; Bones – Part 2&quot; as a replacement for the departed bassist Shawn Economaki. He can also be seen playing bass in TRUSTcompany music video for the single &quot;Heart in My Hands&quot;.
Bolan has another side project called the Quazimotors. He did this project with Skid Row drummer Rob Affuso, Jonathan Callicutt and Evil Jim Wright (guitarist for Spectremen, BigFoot, Road Hawgs).

==Personal life==
Bolan married longtime girlfriend Donna &quot;Roxxi&quot; Feldman on June 10, 1994, but later divorced. He has no children.

He drives racecars in his free time. He competes in high performance go-karts, Legends Cars, Thunder Roadster, and Pro-Challenge series cars.

<text>Raymond of Poitiers (c. 1105 – 29 June 1149) was Prince of Antioch from 1136 to 1149. He was the younger son of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, and his wife Philippa, Countess of Toulouse, born in the very year that his father the Duke began his infamous liaison with Dangereuse de Chatelherault.

==Assuming control==
Following the death of Prince Bohemund II of Antioch in 1130, the principality came under the regency first of King Baldwin II (1130–31), then King Fulk (1131–35), and finally Princess Alice (1135–36), Bohemond&#x27;s widow. The reigning princess was Bohemond II&#x27;s daughter, Constance (born 1127). Against the wishes of Alice, a marriage was arranged for Constance with Raymond, at the time staying in England, which he left only after the death of Henry I on 1 December 1135.

Upon hearing word that Raymond was going to pass through his lands in order to marry the princess of Antioch, King Roger II of Sicily ordered him arrested. By a series of subterfuges, Raymond passed through southern Italy and only arrived at Antioch after 19 April 1136. Patriarch Ralph of Domfront then convinced Alice that Raymond was there to marry her, whereupon she allowed him to enter Antioch (whose loyal garrison had refused him entry) and the patriarch married him to Constance. Alice then left the city, now under the control of Raymond and Ralph.

The first years of their joint rule were spent in conflicts with the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus, who had come south partly to recover Cilicia from Leo of Armenia, and to reassert his rights over Antioch. Raymond was forced to pay homage, and even to promise to cede his principality as soon as he was recompensed by a new fief, which John promised to carve out for him in the Muslim territory to the east of Antioch. The expedition of 1138, in which Raymond joined with John, and which was to conquer this territory, proved a failure. The expedition culminated in the unsuccessful Siege of Shaizar. Raymond was not anxious to help the emperor to acquire new territories, when their acquisition only meant for him the loss of Antioch. John Comnenus returned unsuccessful to Constantinople, after demanding from Raymond, without response, the surrender of the citadel of Antioch.

==Struggles==
There followed a struggle between Raymond and the patriarch. Raymond was annoyed by the homage which he had been forced to pay to the patriarch in 1135 and the dubious validity of the patriarch&#x27;s election offered a handle for opposition. Eventually Raymond triumphed, and the patriarch was deposed (1139). In 1142, John Comnenus returned to the attack, but Raymond refused to recognize or renew his previous submission, and John, though he ravaged the neighborhood of Antioch, was unable to effect anything against him. When, however Raymond demanded from Manuel, who had succeeded John in 1143, the cession of some of the Cilician towns, he found that he had met his match. Manuel forced him to a humiliating visit to Constantinople, during which he renewed his oath of homage and promised to acknowledge a Greek patriarch.

In 1144, news of the fall of Edessa reached Europe, and Raymond of Poitiers had already sent a delegation including Hugh, Bishop of Jabala, to seek aid from Pope Eugene III.

In the last year of Raymond&#x27;s life Louis VII and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine (Raymond&#x27;s niece) visited Antioch during the Second Crusade. Raymond sought to prevent Louis from going south to Jerusalem and to induce him to stay in Antioch and help in the conquest of Aleppo and Caesarea. Raymond was also suspected of having an incestuous affair with his beautiful niece Eleanor. According to John of Salisbury, Louis became suspicious of the attention Raymond lavished on Eleanor, and the long conversations they enjoyed. William of Tyre claims that Raymond seduced Eleanor to get revenge on her husband, who refused to aid him in his wars against the Saracens, and that &quot;&quot;contrary to [Eleanor&#x27;s] royal dignity, she disregarded her marriage vows and was unfaithful to her husband.&quot; Most modern historians dismiss such rumours, however, pointing out the closeness of Raymond and his niece during her early childhood, and the effulgent Aquitainian manner of behaviour. Also, as the pious Louis continued to have relations with his wife, it is doubtful that he believed his charge of incest.
Louis hastily left Antioch and Raymond was balked in his plans. In 1149 he was killed in the Battle of Inab during an expedition against Nur ad-Din Zangi. He was beheaded by Shirkuh, the uncle of Saladin, and his head was placed in a silver box and sent to the Caliph Al-Muqtafi of Baghdad as a gift.

==Personality and family==

Raymond is described by William of Tyre (the main authority for his career) as &quot;a lord of noble descent, of tall and elegant figure, the handsomest of the princes of the earth, a man of charming affability and conversation, open-handed and magnificent beyond measure&quot;&quot;; pre-eminent in the use of arms and military experience; &quot;litteratorum, licet ipse esset, cultor&quot; (&quot;although he was himself illiterate, he was a cultivator of literature&quot; – he caused the &quot;Chanson des chétifs&quot; to be composed); a regular churchman and faithful husband; but headstrong, irascible and unreasonable, with too great a passion for gambling (bk. xiv. c. xxi.). For his career see Rey, in the &quot;Revue de l&#x27;orient latin&quot;, vol. iv.

With Constance he had the following children: 
*Bohemond III
*Maria, married emperor Manuel I Komnenos
*Philippa
*Baldwin

<text>Samuel Alexander Joseph West (born 19 June 1966) is an English actor, theatre director and narrator. He has directed on stage and radio, and worked as an actor in theatre, film, television, and radio. 

West was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of Leonard Bast in the Merchant Ivory film adaptation of E. M. Forster&#x27;s novel &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992), and was later nominated for the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for his portrayal of the title role in &quot;Rupert&#x27;s Land&quot; (1998). In 2010, he was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Jeffrey Skilling in Lucy Prebble&#x27;s &quot;Enron&quot;. He has appeared as reciter with orchestras and performed at the Last Night of the Proms in 2002. He has narrated several documentary series, including five for the BBC about the Second World War.

West currently stars as Siegfried Farnon in the Channel 5 remake of the veterinary drama series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;.

==Early life and education==
West was born on 19 June 1966 in Hammersmith, London, the elder son of the actress Prunella Scales and the late actor Timothy West, and the grandson of the actor Lockwood West. He has one brother, Joe.

West was educated at Alleyn&#x27;s School and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where he studied English literature and was president of the Experimental Theatre Club. West originally intended to attend Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, but chose instead to focus on his career after he was cast as King Caspian in the BBC&#x27;s 1989 series &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;.

==Career==
===Stage===
West made his London stage debut in February 1989 at the Orange Tree Theatre, playing Michael in Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Les Parents Terribles&quot;, of which critic John Thaxter wrote: &quot;He invests the role with a warmth and validity that silences sniggers that could so easily greet a lesser performance of this difficult role, and he lets us share the tumbling emotions of a juvenile torn between romantic first love and filial duty.&quot; Since then, West has appeared frequently on stage; he played Valentine in the first production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; at the National Theatre in 1993, and later spent two seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company playing the title roles in &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, both directed by Steven Pimlott.

In 2002, West made his stage directorial debut with &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not for Burning&quot; at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester. He succeeded Michael Grandage as artistic director of Sheffield Theatres from 2005 to 2007. During his time as artistic director, West revived the controversial &quot;The Romans in Britain,&quot; and also directed &quot;As You Like It&quot; as part of the RSC&#x27;s Complete Works Festival. West left Sheffield when the theatre closed for refurbishment in 2007, and made his West End directorial debut with the first major revival of &quot;Dealer&#x27;s Choice&quot; following its transferral to the Trafalgar Studios. He also continued his acting career: in 2007 he appeared alongside Toby Stephens and Dervla Kirwan in &quot;Betrayal&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse.

In 2008, West played Harry in the Donmar revival of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Family Reunion,&quot; and in 2009 he starred as Jeffrey Skilling in &quot;Enron&quot; by Lucy Prebble. His 2008 production of &quot;Waste&quot; at the Almeida Theatre was chosen by &quot;The Times&quot; as one of its &quot;Productions of the Decade&quot;. From November 2012 to January 2013, he appeared as Astrov in a production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at the Vaudeville Theatre. He played Ivanov and Trigorin in the Chichester Festival Theatre&#x27;s Young Chekhov Season from September 2015, alongside Nina Sosanya, Anna Chancellor, and James McArdle.

In 2023, West played Hugh Delavois in Adrian Edmundson and Nigel Planer&#x27;s comedy play &quot;It’s Headed Straight Towards Us&quot; at the Park Theatre, Londonopposite Rufus Hound. In late 2024, West returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company to play Malvolio in Prasanna Puwanarajah&#x27;s production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; opposite Gwyneth Keyworth, Freema Agyeman and Bally Gill.

West appeared in the film &quot;Reunion&quot; (1989) with Jason Robards and Christien Anholt as an aristocratic boy who befriends the son of a Jewish doctor in 1930s Germany. West played the lower-middle-class clerk Leonard Bast in the Merchant Ivory film adaptation of E. M. Forster&#x27;s novel &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992), featuring Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anthony Hopkins. For this role, he was nominated for best supporting actor at the 1993 BAFTA Film Awards. West appeared with Thompson again in the film &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995).

In voice-over, West provided the voice of Pongo in &quot;101 Dalmatians II: Patch&#x27;s London Adventure&quot;, replacing Rod Taylor.

West&#x27;s film career has continued with roles in films such as Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Van Helsing&quot; and &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;. In 2004, he appeared in the year&#x27;s highest rated mini-series on German television, &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;, which was released in the United States in 2006 as &quot;Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King&quot;. In 2012, he played King George VI in &quot;Hyde Park on Hudson&quot;.

In 2006, West took the lead role in a BBC production of &quot;Random Quest&quot; adapted from the short story by John Wyndham and the next year played Edward Heath in &quot;Margaret Thatcher – The Long Walk to Finchley&quot;, also for the BBC.

In two films (&quot;Iris&quot; in 2001 and the 1996 television film &quot;Over Here&quot;), Sam and his father played the same character at different ages.

In &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; (1975), West and his brother Joseph played young sons of the title character, who was played by their father. In 2002, all three family members performed in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Soldiers Tale&quot; at the St Magnus Festival on Orkney, and in 2006 they gave a rehearsed reading of the Harold Pinter play &quot;Family Voices&quot; as part of the Sheffield Theatres Pinter season.

In May 2015, West&#x27;s reading of &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; was chosen as one of &quot;The 20 best audiobooks of all time&quot; by Carole Mansur of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.

As a reciter West has worked with all the major British orchestras, as well as the Strasbourg Philharmonic Orchestra, Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. Works include Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Egmont&quot;, Schoenburg&#x27;s &quot;Ode To Napoleon&quot;, Strauss&#x27; &quot;Enoch Arden&quot;, Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Carnival of the Animals&quot;, Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Kaddish&quot;, Walton&#x27;s &quot;Façade&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Night Mail&quot; and &quot;The Way to the Sea&quot; by Britten and Auden, the world premieres of &quot;Concrete&quot; by Judith Weir at the Barbican and Howard Goodall&#x27;s &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall and the UK premiere of Jonathan Harvey&#x27;s final piece &quot;Weltethos&quot; at the Symphony Hall, Birmingham. In 2007 West made his New York recital debut in the first performance of &quot;Little Red Violin&quot; by Anne Dudley and Steven Isserlis. In November 2010, West performed a new English translation of Grieg&#x27;s complete incidental music to Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; with the Southampton Philharmonic Choir at Southampton Guildhall. He has performed at the Proms six times, including the suite version of &quot;Henry V&quot; at the 2002 Last Night of the Proms.

He has also appeared with the Nash Ensemble, the Raphael Ensemble, The Hebrides Ensemble, Ensemble 360 and the Lindsay, Dante and Endellion Quartets at the Wigmore Hall, London. Recordings include Prokofief&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; with Sinfonia 21 and Edward Downes, &quot;Salad Days&quot; and Walton&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Leonard Slatkin.

As a choral singer, West has participated in three Choir of London tours to Palestine: in May 2006, when he also gave poetry readings as part of the concert programme; in April 2007 when he directed &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. and in September 2013 (see below).

In 2013, the centenary year of Benjamin Britten, West narrated the Britten/Auden film score &quot;Night Mail&quot; with the Nash Ensemble at the Wigmore Hall and later added &quot;Coal Face, God&#x27;s Chillun, The Peace of Britain, The Way to the Sea&quot; and &quot;The King&#x27;s Stamp&quot; with the Aurora Orchestra at the Queen Elizabeth and Fairfield Halls. In June he played God in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; in Harrogate. In July he appeared in a Proms Plus broadcast discussing Britten&#x27;s setting of poetry. In September he toured Palestine with the Choir of London as staff director of a new opera based on Britten&#x27;s &quot;Hymn to St Cecilia&quot; and sang in Britten&#x27;s &quot;St Nicolas&quot;. In October, he narrated the concert world premiere of &quot;Britten in America&quot; for the Hallé orchestra, which was released on CD together with West&#x27;s recordings of speeches to Britten&#x27;s incidental music for Auden and Isherwood&#x27;s play &quot;The Ascent of F6&quot; (the disc, &quot;Britten to America&quot;, was later nominated for a 2014 Grammy Award for Best Classical Compendium). He also toured a program of Britten cabaret songs and Auden poems across the UK with Ruthie Culver and the UtterJazz Quartet.

In June 2013 he appeared in the video for &quot;Handyman Blues&quot; by Billy Bragg, directed by Johnny Vegas.

On 14 July 2017, one month after the Grenfell Tower fire, BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newshour&quot; programme invited West to read out an excerpt from a letter written by an anonymous firefighter giving a personal account of the fire scene and his inner thoughts on duty that night.

In 2020, West appeared on the album &quot;From The Ground Up&quot;: an ensemble led by Hugo Ticciati improvised over Henry Purcell chaconne bass lines while West read Shakespeare and rapper Baba Israel improvised. The album won the 2020 Gramophone Award for Best Concept Album.
