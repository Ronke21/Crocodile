<text>A head-related transfer function (HRTF) is a response that characterizes how an ear receives a sound from a point in space. As sound strikes the listener, the size and shape of the head, ears, ear canal, density of the head, size and shape of nasal and oral cavities, all transform the sound and affect how it is perceived, boosting some frequencies and attenuating others. Generally speaking, the HRTF boosts frequencies from 2–5 kHz with a primary resonance of +17 dB at 2,700 Hz. But the response curve is more complex than a single bump, affects a broad frequency spectrum, and varies significantly from person to person.

A pair of HRTFs for two ears can be used to synthesize a binaural sound that seems to come from a particular point in space. It is a transfer function, describing how a sound from a specific point will arrive at the ear (generally at the outer end of the auditory canal). Some consumer home entertainment products designed to reproduce surround sound from stereo (two-speaker) headphones use HRTFs. Some forms of HRTF processing have also been included in computer software to simulate surround sound playback from loudspeakers.

==Sound localization==
Humans have just two ears, but can locate sounds in three dimensions – in range (distance), in direction above and below (elevation), in front and to the rear, as well as to either side (azimuth). This is possible because the brain, inner ear, and the external ears (pinna) work together to make inferences about location. This ability to localize sound sources may have developed in humans and ancestors as an evolutionary necessity since the eyes can only see a fraction of the world around a viewer, and vision is hampered in darkness, while the ability to localize a sound source works in all directions, to varying accuracy, 
regardless of the surrounding light.

Humans estimate the location of a source by taking cues derived from one ear (&quot;monaural cues&quot;), and by comparing cues received at both ears (&quot;difference cues&quot; or &quot;binaural cues&quot;). Among the difference cues are time differences of arrival and intensity differences. The monaural cues come from the interaction between the sound source and the human anatomy, in which the original source sound is modified before it enters the ear canal for processing by the auditory system. These modifications encode the source location and may be captured via an impulse response which relates the source location and the ear location. This impulse response is termed the &quot;head-related impulse response&quot; (HRIR). Convolution of an arbitrary source sound with the HRIR converts the sound to that which would have been heard by the listener if it had been played at the source location, with the listener&#x27;s ear at the receiver location. HRIRs have been used to produce virtual surround sound. 

The HRTF is the Fourier transform of HRIR.

HRTFs for left and right ear (expressed above as HRIRs) describe the filtering of a sound source (&quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)) before it is perceived at the left and right ears as &quot;x&quot;L(&quot;t&quot;) and &quot;x&quot;R(&quot;t&quot;), respectively.

The HRTF can also be described as the modifications to a sound from a direction in free air to the sound as it arrives at the eardrum. These modifications include the shape of the listener&#x27;s outer ear, the shape of the listener&#x27;s head and body, the acoustic characteristics of the space in which the sound is played, and so on. All these characteristics will influence how (or whether) a listener can accurately tell what direction a sound is coming from.

In the AES69-2015 standard, the Audio Engineering Society (AES) has defined the SOFA file format for storing spatially oriented acoustic data like head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). SOFA software libraries and files are collected at the Sofa Conventions website.

== How HRTF works ==

The associated mechanism varies between individuals, as their head and ear shapes differ.

HRTF describes how a given sound wave input (parameterized as frequency and source location) is filtered by the diffraction and reflection properties of the head, pinna, and torso, before the sound reaches the transduction machinery of the eardrum and inner ear (see auditory system). Biologically, the source-location-specific prefiltering effects of these external structures aid in the neural determination of source location, particularly the determination of the source&#x27;s elevation.

== Technical derivation ==


Linear systems analysis defines the transfer function as the complex ratio between the output signal spectrum and the input signal spectrum as a function of frequency. Blauert (1974; cited in Blauert, 1981) initially defined the transfer function as the free-field transfer function (FFTF). Other terms include free-field to eardrum transfer function and the pressure transformation from the free-field to the eardrum. Less specific descriptions include the pinna transfer function, the outer ear transfer function, the pinna response, or directional transfer function (DTF).

The transfer function &quot;H&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) of any linear time-invariant system at frequency &quot;f&quot; is:

:&quot;H&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = Output(&quot;f&quot;) / Input(&quot;f&quot;)

One method used to obtain the HRTF from a given source location is therefore to measure the head-related impulse response (HRIR), &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), at the ear drum for the impulse &quot;Δ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) placed at the source. The HRTF &quot;H&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) is the Fourier transform of the HRIR &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).

Even when measured for a &quot;dummy head&quot; of idealized geometry, HRTF are complicated functions of frequency and the three spatial variables. For distances greater than 1 m from the head, however, the HRTF can be said to attenuate inversely with range. It is this far field HRTF, &quot;H&quot;(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;), that has most often been measured. At closer range, the difference in level observed between the ears can grow quite large, even in the low-frequency region within which negligible level differences are observed in the far field.

HRTFs are typically measured in an anechoic chamber to minimize the influence of early reflections and reverberation on the measured response. HRTFs are measured at small increments of &quot;θ&quot; such as 15° or 30° in the horizontal plane, with interpolation used to synthesize &quot;HRTF&quot;s for arbitrary positions of &quot;θ&quot;. Even with small increments, however, interpolation can lead to front-back confusion, and optimizing the interpolation procedure is an active area of research.

In order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a measured HRTF, it is important that the impulse being generated be of high volume. In practice, however, it can be difficult to generate impulses at high volumes and, if generated, they can be damaging to human ears, so it is more common for HRTFs to be directly calculated in the frequency domain using a frequency-swept sine wave or by using maximum length sequences. User fatigue is still a problem, however, highlighting the need for the ability to interpolate based on fewer measurements.

The head-related transfer function is involved in resolving the cone of confusion, a series of points where interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) are identical for sound sources from many locations around the &quot;0&quot; part of the cone. When a sound is received by the ear it can either go straight down the ear into the ear canal or it can be reflected off the pinnae of the ear, into the ear canal a fraction of a second later. The sound will contain many frequencies, so therefore many copies of this signal will go down the ear all at different times depending on their frequency (according to reflection, diffraction, and their interaction with high and low frequencies and the size of the structures of the ear.) These copies overlap each other, and during this, certain signals are enhanced (where the phases of the signals match) while other copies are canceled out (where the phases of the signal do not match). Essentially, the brain is looking for frequency notches in the signal that correspond to particular known directions of sound.

If another person&#x27;s ears were substituted, the individual would not immediately be able to localize sound, as the patterns of enhancement and cancellation would be different from those patterns the person&#x27;s auditory system is used to. However, after some weeks, the auditory system would adapt to the new head-related transfer function. The inter-subject variability in the spectra of HRTFs has been studied through cluster analyses.

Assessing the variation through changes between the person&#x27;s ear, we can limit our perspective with the degrees of freedom of the head and its relation with the spatial domain. Through this, we eliminate the tilt and other co-ordinate parameters that add complexity. For the purpose of calibration we are only concerned with the direction level to our ears, ergo a specific degree of freedom. Some of the ways in which we can deduce an expression to calibrate the HRTF are:

# Localization of sound in Virtual Auditory space
# HRTF Phase synthesis
# HRTF Magnitude synthesis

=== Localization of sound in virtual auditory space===
A basic assumption in the creation of a virtual auditory space is that if the acoustical waveforms present at a listener&#x27;s eardrums are the same under headphones as in free field, then the listener&#x27;s experience should also be the same.

Typically, sounds generated from headphones are perceived as originating from within the head. In the virtual auditory space, the headphones should be able to &quot;externalize&quot; the sound. Using the HRTF, sounds can be spatially positioned using the technique described below.

Let &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) represent an electrical signal driving a loudspeaker and &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) represent the signal received by a microphone inside the listener&#x27;s eardrum. Similarly, let &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) represent the electrical signal driving a headphone and &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) represent the microphone response to the signal. The goal of the virtual auditory space is to choose &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) such that &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). Applying the Fourier transform to these signals, we come up with the following two equations:

: &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;X&quot;LFM, and
: &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;X&quot;HM,

where &quot;L&quot; is the transfer function of the loudspeaker in the free field, &quot;F&quot; is the HRTF, &quot;M&quot; is the microphone transfer function, and &quot;H&quot; is the headphone-to-eardrum transfer function. Setting &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;Y&quot;, and solving for &quot;X&quot; yields

: &quot;X&quot; = &quot;X&quot;LF/H.

By observation, the desired transfer function is

: &quot;T&quot;= &quot;LF&quot;/&quot;H&quot;.
Therefore, theoretically, if &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is passed through this filter and the resulting &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is played on the headphones, it should produce the same signal at the eardrum. Since the filter applies only to a single ear, another one must be derived for the other ear. This process is repeated for many places in the virtual environment to create an array of head-related transfer functions for each position to be recreated while ensuring that the sampling conditions are set by the Nyquist criteria.

=== HRTF phase synthesis ===
There is less reliable phase estimation in the very low part of the frequency band, and in the upper frequencies the phase response is affected by the features of the pinna. Earlier studies also show that the HRTF phase response is mostly linear and that listeners are insensitive to the details of the interaural phase spectrum as long as the interaural time delay (ITD) of the combined low-frequency part of the waveform is maintained. This is the modeled phase response of the subject HRTF as a time delay, dependent on the direction and elevation.

A scaling factor is a function of the anthropometric features. For example, a training set of N subjects would consider each HRTF phase and describe a single ITD scaling factor as the average delay of the group. This computed scaling factor can estimate the time delay as function of the direction and elevation for any given individual. Converting the time delay to phase response for the left and the right ears is trivial.

The HRTF phase can be described by the ITD scaling factor. This is in turn quantified by the anthropometric data of a given individual taken as the source of reference. For a generic case we consider &quot;β&quot; as a sparse vector

: formula_1

that represents the subject&#x27;s anthropometric features as a linear superposition of the anthropometric features from the training data (y = β X), and then apply the same sparse vector directly on the scaling vector H. We can write this task as a minimization problem, for a non-negative shrinking parameter &quot;λ&quot;:

: formula_2

From this,
ITD scaling factor value H is estimated as:

: formula_3

where The ITD scaling factors for all persons in the dataset are stacked in a vector &quot;H&quot; ∈ R, so the value &quot;H&quot; corresponds to the scaling factor of the n-th person.

=== HRTF magnitude synthesis ===
We solve the above minimization problem using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. We assume that the HRTFs are represented by the same relation as the anthropometric features. Therefore, once we learn the sparse vector β from the anthropometric features, we directly apply it to the HRTF tensor data and the subject&#x27;s HRTF values H given by:

: formula_4

where The HRTFs for each subject are described by a tensor of size &quot;D&quot; × &quot;K&quot;, where &quot;D&quot; is the number of HRTF directions and &quot;K&quot; is the number of frequency bins. All &quot;H&quot; corresponds to all the HRTFs of the training set are stacked in a new tensor &quot;H&quot; ∈ R, so the value H corresponds to the &quot;k&quot;-th frequency bin for &quot;d&quot;-th HRTF direction of the &quot;n&quot;-th person. Also &quot;H&quot; corresponds to &quot;k&quot;-th frequency for every d-th HRTF direction of the synthesized HRTF.

== HRTF from geometry ==
Accumulation of HRTF data has made it possible for a computer program to infer an approximate HRTF from head geometry. Two programs are known to do so, both open-source: Mesh2HRTF, which runs physical simulation on a full 3D-mesh of the head, and EAC, which uses a neural network trained from existing HRTFs and works from photo and other rough measurements.

== Recording and playback technology ==
Recordings processed via an HRTF, such as in a computer gaming environment (see A3D, EAX, and OpenAL), which approximates the HRTF of the listener, can be heard through stereo headphones or speakers and interpreted as if they comprise sounds coming from all directions, rather than just two points on either side of the head. The perceived accuracy of the result depends on how closely the HRTF data set matches the characteristics of one&#x27;s own ears, though a generic HRTF may be preferred to an accurate one measured from one&#x27;s one ear. Some vendors like Apple and Sony offer a variety of HRTFs to be selected by the user&#x27;s ear shape.

Windows 10 and above come with Microsoft Spatial Sound included, the same spatial audio framework used on Xbox One and Hololens 2. On a Windows PC or an Xbox One, the framework can use several different downstream audio processors, including Windows Sonic for Headphones, Dolby Atmos, and DTS Headphone:X, to apply an HRTF. The framework can render both fixed-position surround sound sources and dynamic &quot;object&quot; sources that can move in space.

Apple similarly has Spatial Sound for its devices used with headphones produced by Apple or Beats. For music playback to headphones, Dolby Atmos can be enabled and the HRTF applied. The HRTF (or rather, the object positions) can vary with head tracking to maintain the illusion of direction. Qualcomm Snapdragon has a similar head-tracked spatial audio system, used by some brands of Android phones. YouTube uses head-tracked HRTF with 360-degree and VR videos.

Linux is currently unable to directly process any of the proprietary spatial audio (surround plus dynamic objects) formats. SoundScape Renderer offers directional synthesis. PulseAudio and PipeWire each can provide virtual surround (fixed-location channels) using an HRTF. Recent PipeWire versions are also able to provide dynamic spatial rendering using HRTFs, however integration with applications is still in progress. Users can configure their own positional and dynamic sound sources, as well as simulate a surround speaker setup using existing configurations.

The cross-platform OpenAL Soft, an implementation of OpenAL, uses HRTFs for improved localization.

Windows and Linux spatial audio systems support any model of stereo headphones, while Apple only allows spatial audio to be used with Apple or Beats-branded Bluetooth headsets.

<doc id="161006" wikidata="Q657596" url="?curid=161006" title="Unary operation">
<text>In mathematics, a unary operation is an operation with only one operand, i.e. a single input. This is in contrast to &quot;binary operations&quot;, which use two operands. An example is any function , where is a set; the function is a unary operation on .

Common notations are prefix notation (e.g. ¬, −), postfix notation (e.g. factorial ), functional notation (e.g. or ), and superscripts (e.g. transpose ). Other notations exist as well, for example, in the case of the square root, a horizontal bar extending the square root sign over the argument can indicate the extent of the argument.

==Examples==

=== Absolute value ===
Obtaining the absolute value of a number is a unary operation. This function is defined as formula_1 where formula_2 is the absolute value of formula_3.

===Negation===
Negation is used to find the negative value of a single number. Here are some examples:

:formula_4

:formula_5

===Factorial===
For any positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the product of the integers less than or equal to &quot;n&quot; is a unary operation called factorial. In the context of complex numbers, the gamma function is a unary operation extension of factorial.

===Trigonometry===
In trigonometry, the trigonometric functions, such as formula_6, formula_7, and formula_8, can be seen as unary operations. This is because it is possible to provide only one term as input for these functions and retrieve a result. By contrast, binary operations, such as addition, require two different terms to compute a result.

===Examples from programming languages===
Below is a table summarizing common unary operators along with their symbols, description, and examples:

====JavaScript====
In JavaScript, these operators are unary:
*Increment: codice_1, codice_2
*Decrement: codice_3, codice_4
*Positive: codice_5
*Negative: codice_6
*Ones&#x27; complement: codice_7
*Logical negation: codice_8

====C family of languages====
In the C family of languages, the following operators are unary:

*Increment: codice_1, codice_2
*Decrement: codice_3, codice_4
*Address: codice_13
*Indirection: codice_14
*Positive: codice_5
*Negative: codice_6
*Ones&#x27; complement: codice_7
*Logical negation: codice_8
*Sizeof: codice_19

<text>James Barry (11 October 1741 – 22 February 1806) was an Irish painter, best remembered for his six-part series of paintings entitled &quot;The Progress of Human Culture&quot; in the Great Room of the Royal Society of Arts in London. Because of his determination to create art according to his own principles rather than those of his patrons, he is also noted for being one of the earliest romantic painters working in Britain, though as an artist few rated him highly until the fully comprehensive 1983 exhibition at the Tate Gallery led to a reassessment of this &quot;notoriously belligerent personality&quot;, who emerged as one of the most important Irish artists. He was also notable as a profound influence on William Blake.

==Life and work==
James Barry was born in Water Lane (now Seminary Road) on the north side of Cork, Ireland on 11 October 1741. His father had been a builder, and, at one time of his life, a coasting trader between England and Ireland. Barry actually made several voyages as a boy but convinced his father to let him study drawing and art. He first studied painting under local artist John Butts. At the schools in Cork to which he was sent he was regarded as a prodigy. At about the age of seventeen, he first attempted oil painting, and between that and the age of twenty-two, when he first went to Dublin, he produced several large pictures, which decorated his father&#x27;s house, such as &quot;Aeneas escaping with his Family from the Flames of Troy&quot;, &quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot; and &quot;Daniel in the Lions&#x27; Den&quot;&quot;.

The painting that first brought him into public notice, and gained him the acquaintance and patronage of Edmund Burke, was founded on an old tradition of the landing of St Patrick on the sea coast of Cashel, (this is a mistake reproduced from another source, Cashel is an inland town far from the sea) and of the conversion and &quot;Baptism of the King of Cashel&quot; It was exhibited in London in 1762 or 1763 and rediscovered in the 1980s, in unexhibitable condition.

By the liberality of Burke and his other friends, Barry in the latter part of 1765 was enabled to go abroad. He went first to Paris, then to Rome, where he remained upwards of three years, from Rome to Florence and Bologna, and thence home through Venice. While in Italy, he became friendly with the Scottish painter Alexander Runciman and the Swedish sculptor Tobias Sergel. His letters to the Burkes, giving an account of Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian and Leonardo da Vinci, show remarkable insight. Barry painted two pictures while abroad, an &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; and a &quot;Philoctetes&quot;.
Soon after his return to England in 1771, he produced his picture of Venus, which was compared to the Galatea of Raphael, the Venus of Titian and the Venus de Medici. In 1773 he exhibited his &quot;Jupiter and Juno on Mount Ida&quot;. His &quot;Death of General Wolfe&quot;, in which the British and French soldiers are represented in very primitive costumes, was considered a falling-off from his great style of art. His fondness for Greek costume was assigned by his admirers as the cause of his reluctance to paint portraits. His failure to go on with a portrait of Burke which he had begun caused a misunderstanding with his early patron. The difference between them is said to have been widened by Burke&#x27;s growing intimacy with Sir Joshua Reynolds, and by Barry&#x27;s jealousy of the fame and fortune of his rival &quot;in a humbler walk of the art&quot;. About the same time he painted a pair of classical subjects, &quot;Mercury inventing the lyre&quot;, and &quot;Narcissus&quot;, the last suggested to him by Burke. He also painted a historical picture of &quot;Chiron and Achilles&quot;, and another of the story of Stratonice, for which last the duke of Richmond gave him a hundred guineas.

In 1773 it was proposed to decorate the interior of St Paul&#x27;s with historical and sacred subjects; but the plan fell to the ground, from not meeting with the agreement of the bishop of London and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Barry was upset by the failure, for he had in anticipation fixed the subject he intended to paint – the rejection of Christ by the Jews when Pilate proposes his release. In 1773 he published &quot;An Inquiry into the real and imaginary Obstructions to the Acquisition of the Arts in England&quot;, vindicating the capacity of the English for the fine arts and tracing their slow progress to the Reformation, to political and civil dissensions, and lastly to the general direction of the public mind to mechanics, manufactures and commerce.
In 1774 a proposal was made through Valentine Green to Sir Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West, Cipriani, Barry, and other artists to ornament the Great Room of the Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (now the Royal Society of Arts), in London&#x27;s Adelphi, with historical and allegorical paintings. This proposal was at the time rejected by the artists; but in 1777 Barry made an offer to paint the whole on condition that he was allowed the choice of his subjects, and that he would be paid by the society the costs of canvas, paints and models. His offer was accepted. He finished the series of pictures after seven years to the satisfaction of the members of the society, who granted him two exhibitions, and at subsequent periods voted him 50 guineas, a gold medal, and a further 200 guineas. Barry regularly returned to the series for more than a decade, making changes and inserting new features. The series of six paintings—&quot;The progress of human knowledge and culture&quot;—has been described by critic Andrew Graham-Dixon as &quot;Britain&#x27;s late, great answer to the Sistine Chapel&quot;.

Soon after his return from the continent, Barry was chosen as a member of the Royal Academy of Arts; and in 1782 he was appointed professor of painting (1782-99). Working in the room of Edward Penny his salary was £30 a year. Among other things, he insisted on the necessity of purchasing a collection of pictures by the best masters as models for the students and proposed several of those in the Orleans collection. This recommendation was not relished, and in 1799 Barry was expelled from the academy soon after the appearance of his Letter to the Dilettanti Society, an eccentric publication, full of enthusiasm for his art and at the same time of contempt for the living professors of it. Barry remained the only academician ever to be expelled by the academy until Brendan Neiland in July 2004.

During his time at the Royal Academy of Arts, Barry painted &quot;The Thames (or Triumph of Navigation)&quot; in 1791, which featured the English music historian Charles Burney.

After the loss of his salary, a subscription was set on foot by the Earl of Buchan to relieve him from his difficulties, and to settle him in a larger house to finish his picture of Pandora. The subscription amounted to £1000, with which an annuity was bought, but on 6 February 1806 he was seized with illness and died on the 22nd of the same month. On 4 March his remains were interred in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London.

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; has this to say:
As an artist, Barry was more distinguished for the strength of his conceptions, and for his resolute and persistent determination to apply himself only to great subjects, than for his skill in designing or for beauty in his colouring. His drawing is not especially good, his colouring ordinary. He was impulsive; sometimes morose, sometimes sociable and urbane; jealous of his contemporaries, and yet capable of pronouncing a splendid eulogy on Reynolds.

Barry also mastered the art of aquatint.

<doc id="161010" wikidata="Q840261" url="?curid=161010" title="History of Timor-Leste">
<text>Timor-Leste, officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, is a country in Southeast Asia and Oceania. The country comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor and the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco. The first inhabitants are thought to be descendant of Australoid and Melanesian peoples. The Portuguese began to trade with Timor by the early 16th century and colonised it throughout the mid-century. Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty for which Portugal ceded the western half of the island. Imperial Japan occupied East Timor during World War II, but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese surrender.

East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal in 1975, but was invaded by Indonesia. The country was later incorporated as a province of Indonesia. During the subsequent two-decade occupation, a campaign of pacification ensued. Although Indonesia did make substantial investment in infrastructures during its occupation in East Timor, dissatisfaction remained widespread. From 1975 to 1999, there were an estimated 102,800 conflict-related deaths (approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 &#x27;excess&#x27; deaths from hunger and illness), the majority of which occurred during the Indonesian occupation.

In 1999, in a UN-sponsored referendum, an overwhelming majority of East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. Immediately following the referendum, anti-independence Timorese militias – organised and supported by the Indonesian military – commenced a scorched earth campaign. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into West Timor as refugees. The majority of the country&#x27;s infrastructure was destroyed during this attack. The International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) was deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. Following a United Nations-administered transition period, Timor-Leste was internationally recognised as an independent nation in 2002. It is the poorest country in Southeast Asia with a 20% unemployment rate, and approximately one third of the population is illiterate.

==Pre-colonial history==

The island of Timor was populated as part of the human migrations that have shaped Australasia more generally. As of 2019, the oldest traces of human settlement are 43,000 to 44,000 years old, and were found in the Laili cave in Manatuto Municipality. These early settlers had high-level maritime skills, and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands, as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna. One of the oldest fish hooks in the world, dated between 16,000 and 23,000 years old, was excavated at the Jerimalai cave. It is believed that survivors from three waves of migration still live in the country. The first is described by anthropologists as people of the Veddo-Australoid type.

Around 3000 BC, a second migration brought Melanesians. The earlier Veddo-Australoid peoples withdrew at this time to the mountainous interior. Finally, proto-Malays arrived from south China and north Indochina. Timorese origin myths tell of ancestors that sailed around the eastern end of Timor arriving on land in the south.

These multiple waves of migrations combined with the mountainous geography of the island led to a diverse mix of languages and culture. What is now Timor-Leste was split between up to 46 kingdoms. However, there was little influence from the large Islamic Javanese powers to the west.

The later Timorese were not seafarers, rather they were land focused people who rarely made contact with other islands. Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused people that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, sandalwood, deer horn, bees&#x27; wax, and slaves.

Several fortifications uncovered in Timor were built between 1000 and 1300. Climatic changes, in particular during the Little Ice Age, and the increased trade in sandalwood, are thought to have increased tensions around the control of resources during that time.

The first known mention of Timor in writing can be found in the 13th-century Chinese Zhu Fan Zhi, which describes various products and civilisations found outside China. In the Zhu Fan Zhi, Timor is called &quot;Ti-Wen&quot; and is noted for its sandalwood. In 1365, the Nagarakretagama, which contains descriptions of the Majapahit Empire at its peak, identifies Timor as an island within Majapahit&#x27;s realm. However, as Portuguese chronologist Tomé Pires wrote in the 16th century, all islands east of Java were called &quot;Timor&quot;.

Early European explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century. One of the most significant is the Wehali kingdom in central Timor, to which the Tetum, Bunaq and Kemak ethnic groups were aligned.

The first circumnavigation of the world, the Magellan expedition, visited Timor and they recorded that Lucoes (People from Luzon, Philippines) traded in East Timor in order to gather sandalwood for export abroad.

==Portuguese rule==

The first Europeans to arrive in the area were the Portuguese, who landed near present-day Pante Macassar. These Portuguese were traders that arrived between 1512 and 1515. However, only in 1556 did a group of Dominican friars establish their missionary work in the area, settling just north in Solor. War with the Netherlands reduced Portuguese control in the Malay archipelago, limiting them mostly to the Lesser Sunda Islands. Later wars further reduced Portuguese influence, with Solor falling in 1613, and Kupang in the west of Timor falling in 1653.

Dutch and Portuguese sources relate that the island was divided into two collections of kingdoms. Sixteen kingdoms were grouped into in the west, while in the east fifty kingdoms were part of Belos.

By the seventeenth century the village of Lifau – today part of the Oecussi enclave – had become the centre of Portuguese activities. At this time, the Portuguese began to convert the Timorese to Catholicism. Starting in 1642, a military expedition led by the Portuguese Francisco Fernandes took place. The aim of this expedition was to weaken the power of the Timor kings and even as this expedition was made by the Topasses, the &#x27;Black Portuguese&#x27;, it succeeded to extend the Portuguese influence into the interior of the country. In 1702 a Governor was appointed for Solor and Timor, based in Lifau. Portuguese control over the territory was tenuous, with opposition coming from Dominican friars, the Topasses, restive vassal kingdoms, and the south Sulawesi-based Gowa and Talloq sultanates. A rebellion in 1725 led to a campaign by Portuguese forces and allies from the north coast, which culminated in Portuguese victory at the 1726 Battle of Cailaco. In 1769, seeking to wrest control from the Topasses, the Portuguese governor moved his administration along with 1,200 people from Lifau to what would become Dili. The control of colonial administrators, largely restricted to Dili, had to rely on traditional tribal chieftains for control and influence.

For both Portugal and the Netherlands, Timor remained a low priority with little presence outside of the cities of Dili and Kupang. Nonetheless, continuing disputes over competing spheres of influence with the Dutch led to a number of treaties aimed at formalising borders and eliminating enclaves. The border between Portuguese Timor and the Dutch East Indies was formally decided in 1859 with the Treaty of Lisbon. Portugal received the eastern half, together with the north coast pocket of Oecussi. There are competing views over whether this border reflected existing cultural differences. This 1859 treaty saw Portugal take control of Maubara, where the Dutch had begun coffee cultivation, in exchange for formally relinquishing claims in Solor and Flores.

In 1844 Timor, along with Macau and Solor, was removed from the jurisdiction of Portuguese India. A few years later in 1850, Portuguese Timor was removed from the jurisdiction of the governor of Macau, before being returned to the jurisdiction of Portuguese India in 1856. In 1863, Dili was declared a city (although the news may not have arrived to the city until the next year), and East Timor became directly subordinate to the Lisbon government. In 1866 the territory was again put under the jurisdiction of Macau. An 1887 mutiny in Dili led to the death of the Governor at the time. The territory was separated from Macau for the last time in 1896, again coming directly under the jurisdiction of Lisbon, and becoming a full province in 1909.

In 1910–12, the East Timorese rebelled against Portugal. Troops from Mozambique and naval gunfire were brought in to suppress the rebels. The definitive border was drawn by The Hague in 1914, and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of Timor-Leste and Indonesia. Maucatar became part of Portuguese Timor during this period. The Portuguese Timorese pataca became the sole official currency in 1915. Difficulties in communication and logistics arising as a result of World War I led to trade disruptions. Economic difficulties and an inability to pay salaries led to a small revolt in 1919.

For the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century. Investment in infrastructure, health, and education was minimal. The island was seen as a way to exile those who the government in Lisbon saw as &quot;problems&quot; – these included political prisoners as well as ordinary criminals. Portuguese ruled through a traditional system of liurai (local chiefs). Sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. In places where Portuguese rule was asserted, it tended to be brutal and exploitative. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies. Portuguese authorities created an administrative structure based on the existing kingdoms, while also creating a new level of administration under them, the &quot;suco&quot;. This new level was created around villages, or groups of villages linked by kinship. These new administrative boundaries thus reflected family ties, and strengthened family power as villages gained administrative power. This created a permanent shift of powers from the level of the kingdom to that of the villages.

The administration of José Celestino da Silva began in 1893. He aimed to make the territory profitable. To gain more control he reduced the power of local kings, and even eliminated smaller and more disloyal ones. Implementation of the head tax required a census, and depended on the loyalty of the local leaders who would be responsible for collection. He also sought to impose a head tax which collected tax from each household, necessitating a census of the territory to count these households. The head tax was imposed by Silva&#x27;s successor, Eduardo Augusto Marques, once the census was complete. The needs of the census meant power at this time also flowed to leaders of &quot;aldeias&quot;, a smaller unit that &quot;sucos&quot; whose leaders were responsible for some tax collection and were given formal military ranks.

The remaining power of the kings further diminished after the 5 October 1910 revolution made Portugal a republic, especially as many Timorese kings were monarchist sympathisers. The kings now operated Administrative posts on behalf of the Portuguese.

Portuguese Timor had been a place of exile for political and social opponents deported from the metropolis since the late nineteenth century. Among them a large proportion were members of the anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist movement, which until the Second World War was the most influential of the left-wing movements in Portugal. The main waves of deportations to Timor were in 1896, 1927, and 1931. Some of the activists continued their resistance even in exile. After World War II, the remaining exiles were pardoned and allowed to return.
Although Portugal was neutral during World War II, in December 1941, Portuguese Timor was occupied by Australian and Dutch forces, which were expecting a Japanese invasion. This Australian military intervention dragged Portuguese Timor into the Pacific War but it also slowed the Japanese expansion. When the Japanese did occupy Timor, in February 1942, a 400-strong Dutch-Australian force and large numbers of Timorese volunteers engaged them in a one-year guerrilla campaign. After the allied evacuation in February 1943 the East Timorese continued fighting the Japanese, with comparatively little collaboration with the enemy taking place. This assistance cost the civilian population dearly: Japanese forces burned many villages and seized food supplies. The Japanese occupation resulted in the deaths of 40,000–70,000 Timorese.

Under Japanese rule, there were changes to the administrative structures that created larger districts (the former kingdoms) and a reduced number of &quot;suco&quot;.

Portuguese Timor was handed back to Portugal after the war, but Portugal continued to neglect the colony. Very little investment was made in infrastructure, education and healthcare. The colony was declared an &#x27;Overseas Province&#x27; of the Portuguese Republic in 1955. Locally, authority rested with the Portuguese Governor and the Legislative Council, as well as local chiefs or &quot;liurai&quot;. Only a small minority of Timorese were educated, and even fewer went on to university in Portugal (there were no universities in the territory until 2000).

During this time, Indonesia did not express any interest in Portuguese Timor, despite the anti-colonial rhetoric of President Sukarno. This was partly as Indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of West Irian, now called Papua, which had been retained by the Netherlands after Indonesian independence. In fact, at the United Nations, Indonesian diplomats stressed that their country did not seek control over any territory outside the former Netherlands East Indies, explicitly mentioning Portuguese Timor.

In 1960 East Timor gained the right to self-determination under international law, as a Non-Self-Governing Territory. It retained this status, with Portugal as the administering power, throughout Indonesian rule.

The small 1959 Viqueque rebellion saw attempts by the rebels to seek support outside their local area, although it did not overcome local rivalries. Its calls for better services and rights led to some changes in Portuguese policy such as increases in education and civil employment. Basic schooling was increased, and more advanced schools that included secondary education were available to the most Portuguese individuals: those considered mestiço or assimilado. A catholic school in Soibada, the Seminary of Our Lady of Fatima in Dare, and the Liceu Dr. Francisco Machado were important educational establishments during this time. Fatumaca College was established near Baucau in 1969, and an &quot;Escola Tecnica&quot; was set up in 1973. The politicians who came to prominence at the end of Portuguese rule tended to have studied in these schools, and some cited the Viqueque rebellion as an inspiration. This &quot;Timorisation&quot;, which resulted in greater local participation in administration and the military, remained mostly limited to the aforementioned upper class, and did not substantially affect the majority of the population.

==Decolonisation, coup, and independence==
The decolonisation process instigated by the 1974 Portuguese revolution saw Portugal effectively abandon the colony of Portuguese Timor. A civil war between supporters of Portuguese Timorese political parties, the left-wing Fretilin and the right-wing UDT, broke out in 1975 as UDT attempted a coup which Fretilin resisted with the help of local Portuguese military.

One of the first acts of the new government in Lisbon was to appoint a new governor for the colony on 18 November 1974, in the form of Mário Lemos Pires, who would ultimately be, as events were to prove, the last governor of Portuguese Timor.

One of his first decrees made upon his arrival in Dili was to legalise political parties in preparation for elections to a Constituent Assembly in 1976. Three main political parties were formed:

* The &quot;União Democrática Timorense&quot; (UDT, Timorese Democratic Union), was supported by the traditional elites, initially argued for a continued association with Lisbon, or as they put it in Tetum, &quot;mate bandera hum&quot; — &#x27;in the shadow of the [Portuguese] flag&#x27;, but later adopted a &#x27;gradualist&#x27; approach to independence. One of its leaders, Mário Viegas Carrascalão, one of the few Timorese to have been educated at university in Portugal, later became Indonesian Governor of East Timor during the 1980s and early 1990s, although with the demise of Indonesian rule, he would change to supporting independence.
* The &quot;Associação Social Democrática Timorense&quot; (ASDT, Timorese Social Democratic Association) supported a rapid movement to independence. It later changed its name to &quot;Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente&quot; (Revolutionary Front of Independent East Timor or Fretilin). Fretilin was regarded by many in Australia and Indonesia as being Marxist, its name sounding reminiscent of FRELIMO in Mozambique. The party committed itself to &quot;the universal doctrines of socialism&quot;.
* The &quot;Associação Popular Democrática Timorense&quot; (&quot;Apodeti&quot;, Timorese Popular Democratic Association) supported integration with Indonesia, as an autonomous province, but had little grassroots support. One of its leaders, Abílio Osório Soares, later served as the last Indonesian-appointed Governor of East Timor. Apodeti drew support from a few &quot;liurai&quot; in the border region, some of whom had collaborated with the Japanese during the Second World War. It also had some support in the small Muslim minority, although Marí Alkatiri, a Muslim, was a prominent Fretilin leader, and became prime minister in 2002.

Other smaller parties included &quot;Klibur Oan Timur Asuwain&quot; (KOTA, Tetum for &#x27;Sons of the Mountain Warriors&#x27;), which sought to create a form of monarchy involving the local &quot;liurai&quot;, and the &quot;Partido Trabalhista&quot; (Labour Party), but neither had any significant support. They would, however, collaborate with Indonesia. The &quot;Associação Democrática para a Integração de Timor-Leste na Austrália&quot; (ADITLA) advocated integration with Australia, but folded after the Australian government emphatically ruled out the idea.

This period saw the emergence of a unified national consciousness among the social elites who led the newly established political parties. The main parties all promoted freedom of expression, association, and religion, although party support was linked to the home regions of each party&#x27;s leaders. Fretilin explicitly sought to develop an overarching national identity, which was labelled &quot;maubere&quot;.

===Parties compete, foreign powers take interest===
Developments in Portuguese Timor during 1974 and 1975 were watched closely by Indonesia and Australia. Suharto&#x27;s &quot;New Order&quot;, which had effectively eliminated Indonesia&#x27;s Communist Party PKI in 1965, was alarmed by what it saw as the increasingly left-leaning Fretilin, and by the prospect of a small independent leftist state in the midst of the archipelago inspiring separatism in parts of the surrounding archipelago.

Australia&#x27;s Labor prime minister, Gough Whitlam, had developed a close working relationship with the Indonesian leader, and also followed events with concern. At a meeting in the Javanese town of Wonosobo in 1974, he told Suharto that an independent Portuguese Timor would be &#x27;an unviable state, and a potential threat to the stability of the region&#x27;. While recognising the need for an act of self-determination, he considered integration with Indonesia to be in Portuguese Timor&#x27;s best interests.

In local elections on 13 March 1975, Fretilin and UDT emerged as the largest parties, having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence.

Indonesian military intelligence, known as BAKIN, began attempting to cause divisions between the pro-independence parties, and promote the support of Apodeti. This was known as &quot;Operasi Komodo&quot; or &#x27;Operation Komodo&#x27; after the giant Komodo lizard found in the eastern Indonesian island of the same name. Many Indonesian military figures held meetings with UDT leaders, who made it plain that Jakarta would not tolerate a Fretilin-led administration in an independent East Timor. The coalition between Fretilin and UDT later broke up.

During the course of 1975, Portugal became increasingly detached from political developments in its colony, becoming embroiled in civil unrest and political crises, and more concerned with decolonisation in its African colonies of Angola and Mozambique than with Portuguese Timor. Many local leaders saw independence as unrealistic, and were open to discussions with Jakarta over Portuguese Timor&#x27;s incorporation into the Indonesian state.

===The coup===

On 11 August 1975, the UDT mounted a coup, in a bid to halt the increasing popularity of Fretilin. Portuguese Governor Mário Lemos Pires fled to the offshore island of Atauro, north of the capital, Dili, from where he later attempted to broker an agreement between the two sides. He was urged by Fretilin to return and resume the decolonisation process, but he insisted that he was awaiting instructions from the government in Lisbon, now increasingly uninterested.

Indonesia sought to portray the conflict as a civil war, which had plunged Portuguese Timor into chaos, but after only a month, aid and relief agencies from Australia and elsewhere visited the territory, and reported that the situation was stable. Nevertheless, many UDT supporters had fled across the border into Indonesian Timor, where they were coerced into supporting integration with Indonesia. In October 1975, in the border town of Balibo, two Australian television crews (the &quot;Balibo Five&quot;) reporting on the conflict were killed by Indonesian forces, after they witnessed Indonesian incursions into Portuguese Timor.

===Unilateral declaration of independence===

While Fretilin had sought the return of the Portuguese governor, pointedly flying the Portuguese flag from government offices, the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support, independently of Portugal.

On 28 November 1975, Fretilin made a unilateral declaration of independence of the &quot;Democratic Republic of East Timor&quot; (&quot;República Democrática de Timor-Leste&quot; in Portuguese). This was not recognised by either Portugal, Indonesia, or Australia; however, the UDI state received formal diplomatic recognition from six countries that were led by leftist or Marxist–Leninist parties, namely Albania, Cape Verde, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and São Tomé and Príncipe. Fretilin&#x27;s Francisco Xavier do Amaral became the first president, while Fretilin leader Nicolau dos Reis Lobato was prime minister.

Indonesia&#x27;s response was to have UDT, Apodeti, KOTA and Trabalhista leaders sign a declaration calling for integration with Indonesia called the &quot;Balibo Declaration&quot;, although it was drafted by Indonesian intelligence and signed in Bali, Indonesia not Balibo, Portuguese Timor. Xanana Gusmão, now the country&#x27;s prime minister, described this as the &#x27;Balibohong Declaration&#x27;, a pun on the Indonesian word for &#x27;lie&#x27;.

Fretilin restored the original administrative posts, hoping to shore up local support by more closely reflecting traditional kingdoms.

===East Timor solidarity movement===
An international &quot;East Timor solidarity movement&quot; arose in response to the 1975 invasion of East Timor by Indonesia and the occupation that followed. The movement was supported by churches, human rights groups, and peace campaigners, but developed its own organisations and infrastructure in many countries. Many demonstrations and vigils backed legislative actions to cut off military supplies to Indonesia. The movement was most extensive in neighbouring Australia, in Portugal, in the Philippines and the former Portuguese colonies in Africa, but had significant force in the United States, Canada and Europe.

José Ramos-Horta, later president of Timor-Leste, stated in a 2007 interview that the solidarity movement &quot;was instrumental. They were like our peaceful foot soldiers, and fought many battles for us.&quot;

==Indonesian invasion and annexation==
The Indonesian invasion of East Timor began on 7 December 1975. Indonesian forces launched a massive air and sea invasion, known as &quot;Operasi Seroja&quot;, or &#x27;Operation Komodo&#x27;, almost entirely using US-supplied equipment even if Kissinger feared this would be revealed to the public. Moreover, according to declassified documents released by the National Security Archive (NSA) in December 2001, the United States gave its agreement to Indonesia for the invasion. In fact, when the Indonesian president Suharto asked the understanding of taking rapid drastic action in East Timor to US president Gerald Ford, he replied, &quot;We will understand and not press you on the issue. We understand the problem and the intentions you have.&quot;
The Australian government did not react to this invasion. The reason may be the existence of oil found in the waters between Indonesia and Australia. This lack of action resulted in massive protests by Australian citizens remembering the heroic actions of the Timorese during World War II.

Reasons given by Indonesia for the invasion included the potential for a communist government, the need to develop the territory, national and regional security risks. Public statements denied that the invasion was aimed at taking the territory, and noted continued support for self-determination. Nominal elections were held under Indonesian coercion, and on 17 December Indonesia declared that an East Timorese Provisional Government would be formed that included representatives from Apodeti, UDT, KOTA, and the Labour Party.

Attempts by the United Nations Secretary General&#x27;s Special Representative, Vittorio Winspeare-Guicciardi to visit Fretilin-held areas from Darwin, Australia, were obstructed by the Indonesian military, which blockaded East Timor. On 31 May 1976, the government selected 37 individuals to form a &#x27;People&#x27;s Assembly&#x27; in Dili. This assembly unanimously endorsed integration into Indonesia, cementing an Indonesian narrative of union with Indonesia as an act of self-determination. On 17 July, East Timor officially became the 27th province of the Republic of Indonesia (Timor Timur). The provisional government made appeals to the UN to have this integration recognised as a legitimate act of self-determination.

Nonetheless, the occupation of East Timor remained a public issue in many nations, Portugal in particular, and the UN never recognised either the regime installed by the Indonesians or the subsequent annexation. We can refer to the resolution approved by the United nations General Assembly on 12 December 1975, saying &quot;having heard the statements of the representatives of Portugal, as the Administering Power, concerning developments in Portuguese Timor...deplores the military intervention of the armed forces of Indonesia in Portuguese Timor and calls upon the Government of Indonesia to withdraw without delay its armed forces from the Territory...and recommends that the Security Council take urgent action to protect the territorial integrity of Portuguese Timor and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination&quot;. From 1975 to 1982, the General Assembly asserted each year the right of East Timor to self-determination. Portugal remained the recognised administering authority, and Indonesian forces were called to withdraw. José Ramos-Horta represented FRETILIN at the UN, where he campaigned for independence.

Despite this international opposition, few actions were taken to support independence. Many states tacitly accepted Indonesian control. Australia went as far as to officially recognise the annexation, and downplay the death of five Australian journalists during the invasion. Such actions were caused by attempts to remain on good terms with Indonesia, especially in the context of the Cold War. Despite an expressed aversion to the use of military force, the Indonesian invasion was not seriously opposed. Indeed, there was to implicit support. The United States held joint military drills with Indonesia prior to the invasion, and at the time of the invasion around 90% of Indonesia&#x27;s arms originated from the United States. Military support continued, and even increased, after the invasion. There was also little support among other countries in ASEAN for East Timorese independence, with a similar fear of communism, as well as fear of regional instability. Malaysia provided strong support in international forums, despite previous conflicts with Indonesia, as it sought to repress its own independence movement and leave open the option of incorporating Brunei. The Philippines and Thailand also voted with Indonesia in the UN, with the Philippines also fighting separatists at the time. Singapore was less initially supportive, but later sought to have the situation accepted &quot;fait accompli&quot;. Portugal, while not providing strong opposition leading up to the invasion, later led international support for self-determination.

Resistance shifted to the interior, where FRETILIN continued to hold territory (knows as the &quot;zonas libertadas&quot;). In 1976 administration of these areas was divided into six sectors, each with civilian and military leadership. These sectors covered the traditional regions (&quot;concelhos&quot;) of Portuguese rule, and were similarly divided into posts (&quot;postos&quot;), &quot;sucos&quot;, and &quot;aldeias&quot;. The &quot;sucos&quot; level was removed in 1977. Continuing Indonesian campaigning led to the slow capture of these territories, which this conquest being completed in 1978. Indonesia adopted the existing &quot;suco&quot; system to manage its administration, while resistance to Indonesian rules was also organised on &quot;suco&quot; lines.

In an effort to stamp greater control over its dissident new province – whose seizure was condemned by the United Nations – Indonesia invested considerable sums in Timor-Leste leading to more rapid economic growth which averaged 6% per year over the period 1983–1997. Unlike the Portuguese, the Indonesians favoured strong, direct rule, which was never accepted by the Timorese people, who were determined to preserve their culture and national identity.
By 1976 there were 35,000 Indonesian troops in East Timor. Falintil, the military wing of Fretilin, fought a guerrilla war with marked success in the first few years but weakened considerably thereafter. The cost of the brutal takeover to the East Timorese was huge; it&#x27;s estimated that at least 100,000 died in the hostilities, and ensuing disease and famine. Other reported death tolls from the 24-year occupation range from 60,000 to 200,000. A detailed statistical report prepared for the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor cited a lower range of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974–1999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 &#x27;excess&#x27; deaths from hunger and illness. There were also reports of rapes, burning and sacking of buildings.
By February 1976, with troops spreading out from the capital to occupy villages to the east and south, East Timor&#x27;s Indonesian-appointed deputy governor, Lopez la Cruz, admitted that 60,000 East Timorese had been killed. Troop numbers were increased and draconian controls were imposed on the population, isolating the territory from the outside world.

By 1989, Indonesia had things firmly under control and opened East Timor to tourism. Then, on 12 November 1991 Indonesian troops fired on protesters gathered at the Santa Cruz Cemetery in Dili to commemorate the killing of an independence activist. With the event captured on film and aired around the world, the embarrassed Indonesian government admitted to 19 killings, although it&#x27;s estimated that over 200 died in the massacre.

While Indonesia introduced a civilian administration, the military remained in control. Aided by secret police and civilian Timorese militia to crush dissent, reports of arrest, torture, and murder were numerous.

== Towards independence ==
Timorese groups fought a campaign of resistance against Indonesian forces for the independence of East Timor, during which many atrocities and human rights violations by the Indonesian army were reported, which Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono accepted in 2008 that Indonesia had been guilty of. Foreign powers such as the Australian government, concerned to maintain good relations with Indonesia, had been consistently reluctant to assist a push for independence (despite popular sympathy for the East Timorese cause among many in the Australian electorate). However, the departure of President Suharto and a shift in Australian policy by the Howard government in 1998 precipitated a proposal for a referendum on the question of independence. Ongoing lobbying by the Portuguese government also provided impetus.

===Effects of the Dili Massacre===
The Dili Massacre on 12 November 1991 was a turning point for sympathy for pro-independence East Timorese. A burgeoning East Timor solidarity movement grew in Portugal, Australia, and the United States. After the massacre, the US Congress voted to cut off funding for IMET training of Indonesian military personnel. However, arms sales continued from the US to the Indonesian National Armed Forces. President Bill Clinton cut off all US military ties with the Indonesian military in 1999. The Australian government promoted a strong connection with the Indonesian military at the time of the massacre, but also cut off ties in 1999.
The Massacre had a profound effect on public opinion in Portugal, especially after television footage showing East Timorese praying in Portuguese, and independence leader Xanana Gusmão gained widespread respect, being awarded the Portugal&#x27;s highest honour in 1993, after he had been captured and imprisoned by the Indonesians.

Australia&#x27;s troubled relationship with the Suharto regime was brought into focus by the Massacre. In Australia, there was also widespread public outrage, and criticism of Canberra&#x27;s close relationship with the Suharto regime and recognition of Jakarta&#x27;s sovereignty over East Timor. This caused the Australian government embarrassment, but Foreign Minister Gareth Evans played down the killings, describing them as &quot;an aberration, not an act of state policy&quot;. Prime Minister Paul Keating&#x27;s (1991–1996) first overseas trip was to Indonesia in April 1992 and sought to improve trade and cultural relations, but repression of the East Timorese continued to mar co-operation between the two nations.

Gareth Evans and Keatings gave maintenance of close relations with the Indonesian government a high priority, as did the subsequent prime minister John Howard and foreign minister Alexander Downer during their first term in office (1996–1998). Australian governments saw good relations and stability in Indonesia (Australia&#x27;s largest neighbour) as providing an important security buffer to Australia&#x27;s north. Nevertheless, Australia provided important sanctuary to East Timorese independence advocates like José Ramos-Horta (who based himself in Australia during his exile).

The fall of President Suharto and the arrival of President B. J. Habibie in 1998 and the rise of Indonesian democracy brought a new prospect for a potential change in the dynamic between the Australian and Indonesian governments.

===Role of the Catholic Church===
The Catholic Church in East Timor played an important role in society throughout the Indonesian occupation. While just 20% of East Timorese called themselves Catholics in 1975, the figure surged to reach 95% by the end of the first decade after the invasion. During the occupation, Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo became one of the most prominent advocates for human rights in East Timor and many priests and nuns risked their lives in defending citizens from military abuses. Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1989 visit to East Timor exposed the occupied territory&#x27;s situation to world media and provided a catalyst for independence activists to seek global support. Officially neutral, the Vatican wished to retain good relations with Indonesia, the world&#x27;s largest Muslim nation. Upon his arrival in East Timor, the Pope symbolically kissed a cross then pressed it to the ground, alluding to his usual practice of kissing the ground on arrival in a nation, and yet avoiding overtly suggesting East Timor was a sovereign country. He spoke fervently against abuses in his sermon, whilst avoiding naming the Indonesian authorities as responsible.

In 1996, Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and José Ramos-Horta, two leading East Timorese activists for peace and independence, received the Nobel Peace Prize for &quot;their work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor&quot;.

A number of priests and nuns were murdered in the violence in East Timor that followed the 1999 Independence referendum. The newly independent nation declared three days of national mourning upon the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005.

===International lobbying===
Portugal started to apply international pressure, raising the issue with its fellow European Union members as well as in wider forums such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the International Court of Justice. However, other EU countries like the UK had close economic relations with Indonesia, including arms sales, and saw no advantage in forcefully raising the issue.

Appeals by those advocating for East Timorese independence were targeted at western citizens as well as governments, emphasising the vision of the new state as a liberal democracy.

In the mid-1990s, the pro-democracy People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PRD) in Indonesia called for withdrawal from East Timor. The party&#x27;s leadership was arrested in July 1996.

In July 1997, visiting South African President Nelson Mandela visited Suharto as well as the imprisoned Xanana Gusmão. He urged the freeing of all East Timorese leaders in a note reading, &quot;We can never normalize the situation in East Timor unless all political leaders, including Mr. Gusmão, are freed. They are the ones who must bring about a solution.&quot; Indonesia&#x27;s government refused but did announce that it would take three months off Gusmão&#x27;s 20-year sentence.

In 1998, the reformasi movement in Indonesia led to the resignation of Suharto and his replacement by President Habibie, which brought political reform towards a more democratic system. In June 1998, facing increasing domestic and international pressure on the issue, Jakarta offered East Timor autonomy within the Indonesian state, although it ruled out independence, and stated that Portugal and the UN must recognise Indonesian sovereignty.

===Referendum for independence, violence===
New Indonesian President B. J. Habibie was prepared to consider a change of status for East Timor.
Portugal had started to gain some political allies firstly in the EU, and after that in other places of the world to pressure Indonesia. In late 1998, the Australian Prime Minister John Howard with his Foreign Minister Alexander Downer drafted a letter setting out a major change in Australian policy. The letter supported the idea of autonomy but went much further by suggesting that the East Timorese be given a chance to vote on independence within a decade. The letter, which compared East Timor to New Caledonia, upset Habibie, who saw it as implying Indonesia was a &quot;colonial power&quot;. He decided in response to announce a snap referendum to be conducted within six months. Other reasons for this change of attitude include shifting priorities, greater consideration of international image, and a belief that East Timor would vote for autonomy. In his announcement of the referendum, Habibie cited &quot;norms of democracy and justice&quot; as a reason to allow for self-determination.

News of the proposal provoked a violent reaction in East Timor from pro-Indonesian militia. The Indonesian army did not intervene to restore order. At a summit in Bali John Howard told Habibie that a United Nations Peace Keeping force should oversee the process. Habibie rejected the proposal, believing it would have insulted the Indonesian military.

The United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was created to oversee the referendum in June 1999, six months after Habibie&#x27;s January announcement. Intimidation from pro-Indonesian militia continued during this period, and the referendum was delayed twice. Eventually, the referendum was held on 30 August. It produced a clear majority (78.5%) in favour of independence, rejecting the alternative offer of being an autonomous province within Indonesia, to be known as the Special Autonomous Region of East Timor (SARET).

Before official results were announced, Indonesian military-supported East Timorese pro-integration militia and Indonesian soldiers began a campaign of violence and terrorism in retaliation, &quot;Operation Clean Sweep&quot;. Between 1,500 and 3000 Timorese were killed, and in addition to internal displacement 300,000 were forcibly pushed into West Timor as refugees. The majority of the country&#x27;s infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country&#x27;s electrical grid were destroyed.

Activists in Portugal, Australia, the United States, and elsewhere pressured their governments to take action. The violence was met with widespread public anger in Australia. The Opposition Spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Labor&#x27;s Laurie Brereton, was vocal in highlighting evidence of the Indonesian military&#x27;s involvement in pro-integrationist violence and advocated United Nations peacekeeping to support East Timor&#x27;s ballot. The Catholic Church in Australia urged the Australian Government to send an armed peacekeeping force to East Timor to end the violence. Street protesters harried the Indonesian Embassy.
John Howard conferred with United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and lobbied U. S. President Bill Clinton for an Australian led international peace keeper force to enter East Timor to end the violence. The United States offered crucial logistical and intelligence resources and an &quot;over-horizon&quot; deterrent presence. Finally, on 11 September, Bill Clinton announced:

Indonesia, in dire economic straits relented and on 12 September, Indonesian President Habibie announced:

It was clear that the UN did not have sufficient resources to combat the paramilitary forces directly. Instead, on 15 September the UN authorised the creation of a multinational military force known as INTERFET (International Force for East Timor), with Security Council Resolution 1264. Troops were contributed by 17 nations, about 9,900 in total. 4,400 came from Australia, the remainder mostly from South-East Asia. The force was led by Australian Major-General (now General) Peter Cosgrove.

On 20 September 1999 INTERFET deployed to the country, and Indonesia withdrew both its military and its civilian administration.

==United Nations administration==
On 15 October 1999, the Indonesian People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly repealed the law annexing East Timor. The administration of East Timor was taken over by the UN through the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), established on 25 October, and all remaining Indonesian forces left the territory in November. The INTERFET deployment ended on 14 February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN.

The scope of the UNTAET mission exceeded previous UN peacekeeping efforts. UNTAET exercised effective sovereignty during this period, and engaged in a state-building process to develop institutions and local capacity, in addition to handling immediate humanitarian and security needs. Tensions existed between the mandate of effective governance, and the mandate to quickly prepare the territory for democratic self-governance. Governance was strongly centralised, with less investment in local capacity. A rapid timetable and insufficient engagement with local authorities, including limited cooperation with the National Council of Maubere Resistance, further limited institutional development. Reconstruction efforts included rebuilding the education system. For this textbooks were bought in the new official language, Portuguese, despite many teachers and students being unable to speak it.

Elections were held in late 2001 for a constituent assembly to draft a constitution, a task finished in February 2002. Timor-Leste became formally independent on 20 May 2002. Xanana Gusmão was sworn in as the country&#x27;s president. Timor-Leste became a member of the UN on 27 September 2002.

==The independent republic==

Destruction and violence not only destroyed the country&#x27;s infrastructure and economy, but also drained its human capacity, leading to Ramos-Horta stating &quot;we are starting from absolutely ground zero&quot;.

On 4 December 2002, after a student had been arrested the previous day, rioting students set fire to the house of the Prime Minister Marí Alkatiri and advanced on the police station. The police opened fire and one student was killed, whose body the students carried to the National Parliament building. There they fought the police, set a supermarket on fire and plundered shops. The police opened fire again and four more students were killed. Alkatiri called an inquiry and blamed foreign influence for the violence.

Following independence, all land that had been used by both the Portuguese and Indonesian administrations was declared state land.

The early economy was dependent on foreign funding. In 2004, three-quarters of those earning wages worked for the civil service, the UN, or NGOs. The small private sector was mostly security services.

Administrative borders in this period reverted again to the original Administrative post system, although much of the direct governance took place on the &quot;suco&quot; level, where administrative data was obtained and elections were held. 442 sukus and 2228 aldeias were formally designated in 2004, in preparation for the elections of &quot;suco&quot; chiefs in 2005.

Relations with Indonesia have been cordial. The two countries have defined most of their borders. In 2005, the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor reported on human rights violations in period of Indonesian rule and the year before and offered the first national history of Timor-Leste driven by Timorese oral histories. In 2008, the Indonesia–Timor Leste Commission of Truth and Friendship confirmed most of the earlier Commission&#x27;s findings.

Australia–Timor-Leste relations have been strained by disputes over the maritime boundary between the two countries. Canberra claims petroleum and natural gas fields in an area known as the &#x27;Timor Gap&#x27;, which Timor-Leste regards as lying within its maritime boundaries. Articles relating to this topic include:

* Timor Sea Treaty
* Australia-Timor-Leste spying scandal 
* Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea

===2006 crisis===
Unrest started in the country in April 2006 following riots in Dili. A rally in support of 600 East Timorese soldiers, who were dismissed for deserting their barracks, turned into rioting where five people were killed and over 20,000 fled their homes. Fierce fighting between pro-government troops and disaffected Falintil troops broke out in May 2006. While unclear, the motives behind the fighting appeared to be the distribution of oil funds and the poor organisation of the Timorese army and police, which included former Indonesian-trained police and former Timorese rebels. Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri called the violence a &quot;coup&quot; and welcomed offers of foreign military assistance from several nations. As of 25 May 2006, Australia, Portugal, New Zealand, and Malaysia sent troops to Timor, attempting to quell the violence. At least 23 deaths occurred as a result of the violence.

On 21 June 2006, President Xanana Gusmão formally requested Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri step down. A majority of Fretilin party members demanded the prime minister&#x27;s resignation, accusing him of lying about distributing weapons to civilians. On 26 June 2006 Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri resigned stating, &quot;I declare I am ready to resign my position as prime minister of the government... so as to avoid the resignation of His Excellency the President of the Republic&quot;. In August, rebel leader Alfredo Reinado escaped from Becora Prison, in Dili. Tensions were later raised after armed clashes between youth gangs forced the closure of Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport in late October.

In April 2007, Gusmão declined another presidential term. In the build-up to the April 2007 presidential elections there were renewed outbreaks of violence in February and March 2007. José Ramos-Horta was inaugurated as president on 20 May 2007, following his election win in the second round. Gusmão was sworn in as prime minister on 8 August 2007. President Ramos-Horta was critically injured in an assassination attempt on 11 February 2008, in a failed coup apparently perpetrated by Alfredo Reinado, a renegade soldier who died in the attack. Prime Minister Gusmão also faced gunfire separately but escaped unharmed. The Australian government immediately sent reinforcements to Timor-Leste to keep order.

A 2009 law (Law No 3/2009) set out the legal responsibilities of &quot;suco&quot; administrators, assigning the formal responsibility of relaying government initiatives, and of mediating within their community. This formal power did not override traditional customary practices, with traditional leaders retaining acknowledged informal influence.

=== From 2010s ===

New Zealand announced in early November 2012, it would be pulling its troops out of the country, saying the country was now stable and calm. Five New Zealand troops were killed in the 13 years the country had a military presence in Timor-Leste.

Francisco Guterres of centre-left Fretilin party was the president of Timor-Leste since May 2017 until 19 May 2022. The main party of AMP coalition, National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction, led by independence hero Xanana Gusmão, was in power from 2007 to 2017, but leader of Fretilin Mari Alkatiri formed a coalition government after July 2017 parliamentary election. However, the new minority government soon fell, meaning second general election in May 2018. In June 2018, former president and independence fighter Jose Maria de Vasconcelos known as Taur Matan Ruak of three-party coalition, Alliance of Change for Progress (AMP), became the new prime minister.

The Nobel prize winner, former president José Ramos-Horta won the April 2022 presidential election runoff against the incumbent president, Francisco Guterres . In May 2022, Ramos-Horta was sworn in as Timor-Leste president.

<text>Silas or Silvanus (; Greek: Σίλας/Σιλουανός; fl. 1st century AD) was a leading member of the Early Christian community, who according to the New Testament accompanied Paul the Apostle on his second missionary journey.

==Name and etymologies==
&quot;Silas&quot; is traditionally assumed to be the same as the &quot;Silvanus&quot; mentioned in four epistles. Some translations, including the New International Version, call him &quot;Silas&quot; in the epistles. Paul, Silas, and Timothy are listed as co-authors of the two New Testament letters to the Thessalonians, though the authorship is disputed. The Second Epistle to the Corinthians mentions Silas as having preached with Paul and Timothy to the church in Corinth (), and the First Epistle of Peter describes Silas as a &quot;faithful brother&quot; ().

There is some disagreement over the original or &quot;proper&quot; form of his name: &quot;Silas&quot;, &quot;Silvanus&quot;, &quot;Seila&quot;, and &quot;Saul&quot; seem to be treated at the time as equivalent versions of the same name in different languages, and it is not clear which is the original name of &quot;Silas&quot;, and which is a translation or equivalent nickname, or whether some references are to different persons with equivalent names. He is consistently called &quot;Silas&quot; in the Acts of the Apostles, but the Roman name &quot;Silvanus&quot; (which means &quot;of the forest&quot;) is always used by Paul and in the First Epistle of Peter (); it may be that &quot;Silvanus&quot; is the Romanized version of the original &quot;Silas&quot;, or that &quot;Silas&quot; is the Greek nickname for &quot;Silvanus&quot;. Silas is thus often identified with Silvanus of the Seventy. Catholic theologian Joseph Fitzmyer further points out that &quot;Silas&quot; is the Greek rendition of the Aramaic &quot;Seila&quot; (), a version of the Hebrew &quot;Saul&quot; (), which is attested in Palmyrene inscriptions.

==Biblical narrative==
Silas is first mentioned in , where he and Judas Barsabbas (known often as &#x27;Judas&#x27;) were selected by the church elders to return with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch following the Jerusalem Council. Silas and Judas are mentioned as being leaders among the brothers, prophets and encouraging speakers. Silas was selected by Paul to accompany him on his second mission after Paul and Barnabas split over an argument involving Mark&#x27;s participation. It was during the second mission that he and Paul were imprisoned briefly in Philippi, where an earthquake broke their chains and opened the prison door. Silas is thus sometimes depicted in art carrying broken chains. Acts 16:25-37.

According to , Silas and Timothy travelled with Paul from Philippi to Thessalonica, where they were treated with hostility in the synagogues. The harassers followed the trio to Berea, threatening Paul&#x27;s safety, and causing Paul to separate from Silas and Timothy. Paul travelled to Athens, and Silas and Timothy later joined him in Corinth.

These events can be dated to around AD 50: the reference in to Proconsul Gallio helps ascertain this date (cf. Gallio inscription). According to , Paul ceased to attend the synagogue in Corinth as a result of hostility, Silas is not mentioned thereafter in the Acts narrative.

He appears in the salutation of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and is referred to in 2 Corinthians 1:19. This is as expected, as we read of his involvement in Paul&#x27;s mission when these cities were visited. He also appears in the conclusion of 1 Peter at 5:12, and is perhaps the amanuensis. Peter says he regards Silas as &quot;a faithful brother&quot;.

==Mysticism==
Anne Catherine Emmerich recounts in her visions that Silas&#x27; original name was Sela, and that he was one of the three &quot;secret disciples,&quot; along with Hermas, who had later accompanied Jesus on his trip to the Three Kings&#x27; homeland near Ur, and thence to Heliopolis, and whose parents had come with the caravan of the Three Kings.

==Veneration==
Saint Silas is celebrated in the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and that of the Episcopal Church (United States) with a Lesser Feast on January 26 with Timothy and Titus, and separately on July 13 by the Roman Catholic Church and February 10 by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. Saint Silas is also venerated by the Eastern Orthodox Church on July 30 along with the Apostles Silvanus, Crescens, Epenetus, and Andronicus and on January 4 where he is venerated with all the apostles.

<text>Johnny Appleseed (born John Chapman; September 26, 1774March 18, 1845) was an American pioneer nurseryman who introduced trees grown with apple seeds (as opposed to trees grown with grafting) to large parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Ontario, as well as the northern counties of West Virginia. He became an American legend while still alive, due to his kind, generous ways, his leadership in conservation, and the symbolic importance that he attributed to apples. He was also a missionary for The New Church and the inspiration for many museums and historical sites such as the Johnny Appleseed Museum in Urbana, Ohio.

==Family==
Chapman was born on September 26, 1774, in Leominster, Massachusetts, the second child of Nathaniel and Elizabeth Chapman (&quot;née&quot; Simonds, married February 8, 1770). His birthplace has a granite marker, and the street is now called &quot;Johnny Appleseed Lane&quot;.

Chapman&#x27;s mother Elizabeth died in 1776, shortly after giving birth to her second son Nathaniel Jr., who died a few days later. In 1780, his father Nathaniel returned to Longmeadow, Massachusetts where he married Lucy Cooley.

Author Rosella Rice states, &quot;Johnny had one sister, Persis Broom, of Indiana. She was not at all like him; a very ordinary woman, talkative, and free in her frequent, &#x27;says she&#x27;s&#x27; and &#x27;says I&#x27;s.&#x27;&quot;

According to some accounts, 18-year-old John persuaded his 11-year-old half-brother Nathaniel Cooley Chapman to go west with him in 1792. The duo apparently lived a nomadic life until their father brought his large family west in 1805 and met up with them in Ohio. Nathaniel decided to stay and help their father farm the land.

Shortly after the brothers parted ways, John began his apprenticeship as an orchardist under a Mr. Crawford who grew apples, thus inspiring Chapman&#x27;s life journey of planting apple trees. In 1800 at age 26, Chapman was in Licking River, Ohio. His first orchard was on the farm of Isaac Stadden in Licking County. In 1806, he embarked upon a canoe voyage down the Ohio, Muskingum, and Walhonding Rivers, using two canoes lashed together to transport himself and his seeds.

==Life==
There are stories of Johnny Appleseed practicing his nurseryman craft in the area of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and of picking seeds from the pomace at Potomac River cider mills in the late 1790s. Another story has Chapman living in Pittsburgh on Grant&#x27;s Hill in 1794 at the time of the Whiskey Rebellion.

The popular image is of Johnny Appleseed spreading apple seeds randomly everywhere he went. In fact, he planted nurseries rather than orchards, built fences around them to protect them from livestock and wildlife, left the nurseries in the care of a neighbor who sold trees on shares, and returned every year or two to tend the nursery. He planted his first nursery on the bank of Brokenstraw Creek, south of Warren, Pennsylvania. Next, he seems to have moved to Venango County, along the shore of French Creek, but many of these nurseries were in the Mohican River area of north-central Ohio. This area included the towns of Mansfield, Lisbon, Lucas, Perrysville and Loudonville.

In 1817, a bulletin of the Church of New Jerusalem printed in Manchester, England was the first to publish a written report about Chapman. It described a missionary who traveled around the West to sow apple seeds and pass out books of the New Church.

In 1819, Chapman was nearly killed in an accident in Ohio. One morning, he was picking his crops in a tree when he fell and caught his neck in the fork of the branches. Shortly after he fell, eight year-old John White found him struggling. White cut the tree down, saving Chapman&#x27;s life.

In 1822, the first known use of &quot;John Appleseed&quot; was written in a letter from a member of the New Church.

According to &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot;, toward the end of his career he was present when an itinerant missionary was exhorting an open-air congregation in Mansfield, Ohio. The sermon was long and severe on the topic of extravagance, because the pioneers were buying such indulgences as calico and imported tea. &quot;Where now is there a man who, like the primitive Christians, is traveling to heaven barefooted and clad in coarse raiment?&quot; the preacher repeatedly asked, until Johnny Appleseed walked up to him, put his bare foot on the stump that had served as a pulpit, and said, &quot;Here&#x27;s your primitive Christian!&quot;
Author Rosella Rice met Chapman in his later years, and she stated in the 1863 &quot;History of Ashland County, Ohio&quot;:His personal appearance was as singular as his character. He was a small, &quot;chunked&quot; man, quick and restless in his motions and conversation; his beard, though not long, was unshaven, and his hair was long and dark, and his eye black and sparkling. He lived the roughest life, and often slept in the woods. His clothing was mostly old, being generally given to him in exchange for apple-trees. He went bare-footed, and often traveled miles through the snow in that way... [He] wore on his head a tin utensil which answered both as a cap and a mush pot.

Historian Paul Aron argues, &quot;Chapman was actually a successful businessman. He bought many of the parcels of land on which he planted his seeds and ultimately accumulated about twelve hundred acres across three states... He wore pauper&#x27;s clothing by choice and not out of necessity.&quot;

Chapman would tell stories to children and spread New Church teachings to the adults, receiving in return a floor to sleep on for the night, and sometimes supper. Rice stated, &quot;We can hear him read now, just as he did that summer day, when we were busy quilting upstairs, and he lay near the door, his voice rising denunciatory and thrilling—strong and loud as the roar of wind and waves, then soft and soothing as the balmy airs that quivered the morning-glory leaves about his gray beard. His was a strange eloquence at times, and he was undoubtedly a man of genius.&quot;

Chapman cared deeply about animals, including insects. Henry Howe visited all the counties in Ohio in the early nineteenth century and collected several stories from the 1830s, when Johnny Appleseed was still alive:

One cool autumnal night, while lying by his camp-fire in the woods, he observed that the mosquitoes flew in the blaze and were burned. Johnny, who wore on his head a tin utensil which answered both as a cap and a mush pot, filled it with water and quenched the fire, and afterwards remarked, &quot;God forbid that I should build a fire for my comfort, that should be the means of destroying any of His creatures.&quot;

Another time, he allegedly made a camp-fire in a snowstorm at the end of a hollow log in which he intended to pass the night, but he found it occupied by a bear and cubs, so he removed his fire to the other end and slept on the snow in the open air, rather than disturb the bear.

In a story collected by Eric Braun, he had a pet wolf that had started following him after he healed its injured leg.

More controversially, he also planted dogfennel during his travels, believing that it was a useful medicinal herb. It is now regarded as a noxious, invasive weed.

According to another story, he heard that a horse was to be put down, so he bought the horse, bought a few grassy acres nearby, and turned it out to recover. When it did, he gave the horse to someone needy, exacting a promise to treat it humanely.

During his later life, he was a vegetarian. Chapman chose not to marry, as he believed that he would find his soulmate in Heaven if she did not appear to him on Earth.

==Death==

Different dates are listed for his death. &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; of November 1871 was apparently incorrect in saying that he died in mid-1847, though this is taken by many as the primary source of information about John Chapman. Multiple Indiana newspapers reported his death date as March 18, 1845. The &quot;Goshen Democrat&quot; published a death notice for him in its March 27, 1845, edition, citing the day of death as March 18 of that year. The paper&#x27;s death notice read:

The &quot;Fort Wayne Sentinel&quot; printed his obituary on March 22, 1845, saying that he died on March 18:

Rosella Rice wrote in 1863:He died near Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1846 or 1848, a stranger among strangers, who kindly cared for him. He died the death of the righteous, calmly and peacefully, and with little suffering or pain. So long as his memory lives will a grateful people say: &quot;He went about doing good.&quot;The site of his grave is also disputed. Developers of the Canterbury Green apartment complex and golf course in Fort Wayne, Indiana, claim that his grave is there, marked by a rock. That is where the Worth cabin sat in which he died. 

Steven Fortriede, director of the Allen County Public Library (ACPL) and author of the 1978 &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot;, believes that another gravesite is the correct site, in Johnny Appleseed Park in Fort Wayne. Johnny Appleseed Park is a Fort Wayne city park that adjoins Archer Park, an Allen County park. Archer Park is the site of John Chapman&#x27;s grave marker and used to be a part of the Archer family farm.

The Worth family attended First Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, according to records at ACPL. According to an 1858 interview with Richard Worth Jr., Chapman was buried &quot;respectably&quot; in the Archer cemetery, and Fortriede believes that use of the term &quot;respectably&quot; indicates that Chapman was buried in the hallowed ground of Archer cemetery instead of near the cabin where he died.

John H. Archer, grandson of David Archer, wrote in a letter dated October 4, 1900:

In 1934, a committee of the Johnny Appleseed Commission Council of the City of Fort Wayne reported, &quot;[A]s a part of the celebration of Indiana&#x27;s 100th birthday in 1916 an iron fence was placed in the Archer graveyard by the Horticulture Society of Indiana setting off the grave of Johnny Appleseed. At that time, there were men living who had attended the funeral of Johnny Appleseed. Direct and accurate evidence was available then. There was little or no reason for them to make a mistake about the location of this grave. They located the grave in the Archer burying ground.&quot;

==Legacy==
Johnny Appleseed left an estate of over of valuable nurseries to his sister. He also owned four plots in Allen County, Indiana, including a nursery in Milan Township with 15,000 trees, and two plots in Mount Vernon, Ohio. He bought the southwest quarter () of section 26, Mohican Township, Ashland County, Ohio, but did not record the deed and lost the property.

The financial panic of 1837 took a toll on his estate. Trees brought only two or three cents each, as opposed to the &quot;fippenny bit&quot; (about six and a quarter cents) that he usually got. Some of his land was sold to pay taxes following his death, and litigation used up much of the rest.

In 1880, abolitionist author Lydia Maria Child mythologized Appleseed in a poem:

In 1921, 1923, 1927, and 1928, American song poet Vachel Lindsay published poems about Johnny Appleseed. One of these poems was the source text for Eunice Lea Kettering&#x27;s prize-winning choral-orchestral composition &quot;Johnny Appleseed.&quot; Gail Kubik composed a work for bass, chorus and orchestra called &quot;In Praise of Johnny Appleseed&quot;; this work was also based on the eponymous Vachel Lindsay poem, and entered into the same 1942 National Federation of Music Clubs composition competition as Kettering&#x27;s work.

In 1933, poets Rosemary Carr Benét and Stephen Vincent Benét mythologized Appleseed in their children&#x27;s poetry book &quot;A Book of Americans.&quot;

In Disney&#x27;s 1948 film &quot;Melody Time&quot;, Appleseed is featured in an animated musical segment titled &quot;The Legend of Johnny Appleseed&quot;.&quot;&quot;

The first recorded Johnny Appleseed Festival was held in 1968 in Lisbon, Ohio. The festival takes place the third weekend of September in downtown with food and entertainment taking up just over 2 square blocks. Amusement rides are among the 100+ vendors and attractions. Since 1975 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Johnny Appleseed Festival has been held the third full weekend in September in Johnny Appleseed Park and in Archer Park. Musicians, demonstrators, and vendors dress in early-19th-century attire and offer food and beverages that would have been available then. Similar festivals are held in Sheffield, PA; Apple Creek, OH; Crystal Lake, IL; Lisbon, OH; and Paradise, CA.

In 2008, the Fort Wayne Wizards, a minor-league baseball club, changed their name to the Fort Wayne TinCaps. In their first season with the new name (2009), the Tincaps won their only league championship. The name &quot;Tincaps&quot; refers to the tin hat (or pot) which Johnny Appleseed allegedly wore. The team mascot is named &quot;Johnny&quot;.

From 1962 to 1980, a high school athletic league made up of schools from around the Mansfield, Ohio, area used the name the &quot;Johnny Appleseed Conference&quot;.

In 1966, the U.S. Postal Service issued a five-cent stamp commemorating Johnny Appleseed.

A memorial in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio, stands on the summit of the grounds in Section 134. A circular garden surrounds a large stone upon which a bronze statue of Chapman stands, face looking skywards, holding an apple-seedling tree in one hand and a book in the other. A bronze cenotaph identifies him as Johnny Appleseed and gives a brief biography and eulogy.

A bronze statue of Chapman sits on a bench on Jefferson Boulevard in Fort Wayne, Indiana, offering a red apple to visitors who sit beside him. Unveiled in 2020, the sculpture was created by Gary Tillery.

March 11 and September 26 are sometimes celebrated as Johnny Appleseed Day. The September date is Appleseed&#x27;s acknowledged birthdate, but the March date is sometimes preferred because it falls during planting season.

Johnny Appleseed Elementary School is a public school in Leominster, Massachusetts, his birthplace. Mansfield, Ohio, one of Appleseed&#x27;s stops in his peregrinations, was home to Johnny Appleseed Middle School until it closed in 1989.

In 1984, Jill and Michael Gallina published a biographical musical, &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot;.

In 2016, John Chapman appeared in Tracy Chevalier&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;At the Edge of the Orchard.&quot;

A large terracotta sculpture of Johnny Appleseed, created by Viktor Schreckengost (1906–2008), adorns the front of the Lakewood High School Civic Auditorium in Lakewood, Ohio. Although the local board of education deemed Appleseed too &quot;eccentric&quot; a figure to grace the front of the building (renaming the sculpture simply &quot;Early Settler&quot;), students, teachers, and parents alike still call the sculpture by its intended name: &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot;.

Apple uses John and Jane Appleseed as generic name, in a reference to Johnny.

Urbana University in Urbana, Ohio, maintains one of two Johnny Appleseed museums in the world, which is open to the public. The Johnny Appleseed Educational Center and Museum hosts a number of artifacts, as well as trees that are descended from the same trees originally planted by Johnny Appleseed. They also provide a number of services for research, including a national registry of Johnny Appleseed&#x27;s relatives. In 2011, the museum was renovated and updated. The educational center and museum was founded on the belief that those who have the opportunity to study the life of Johnny Appleseed will share his appreciation of education, his country, the environment, peace, moral integrity, and leadership.

Supposedly, the only surviving tree planted by Johnny Appleseed grows on the farm of Richard and Phyllis Algeo of Nova, Ohio. Some marketers claim that it is a Rambo; some even make the claim that the Rambo was &quot;Johnny Appleseed&#x27;s favorite variety&quot;, ignoring the fact that he had religious objections to grafting and preferred wild apples to all named varieties. It appears that most nurseries are calling the tree the &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot; variety, rather than a Rambo. Unlike the mid-summer Rambo, the Johnny Appleseed variety ripens in September and is a baking-applesauce variety similar to an Albemarle Pippin. Nurseries offer the Johnny Appleseed tree as an immature apple tree for planting, with scions from the Algeo stock grafted on them.
Orchardists do not appear to be marketing the fruit of this tree.

== Hard cider ==
Chapman planted his apples by seed, not grafting, but without grafting, about one in a hundred seedlings will yield an apple that is edible as a fruit. According to Henry David Thoreau, an apple grown from seed tastes &quot;sour enough to set a squirrel&#x27;s teeth on edge and make a jay scream.&quot; But apples from seed are perfectly fine for making hard cider, and in the early part of the nineteenth century, there was a demand for hard cider—Ohioans ages fifteen and over drank, on average, thirty gallons of hard cider per year (10.52 ounces per day). Author Michael Pollan believes that since Chapman was against grafting and thus virtually all his apples were not edible and could be used only for cider: &quot;Really, what Johnny Appleseed was doing and the reason he was welcome in every cabin in Ohio and Indiana was he was bringing the gift of alcohol to the frontier. He was our American Dionysus.&quot;

<doc id="161014" wikidata="Q178342" url="?curid=161014" title="Archangel">
<text>Archangels () are the highest rank of angel in the Christian hierarchy of angels, put forward by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in the 5th or 6th century in his book &quot;De Coelesti Hierarchia&quot; (&quot;On the Celestial Hierarchy&quot;). 

The Bible itself uses the term only two times, with no mention in the Old Testament, and does not mention a hierarchy of angels in any detail. The word is usually associated with the Abrahamic religions. Similar beings exist in several other religions.

&quot;Archangel&quot; is derived from Greek (), with the Greek prefix meaning &#x27;chief&#x27;. A common misconception is that archangels constitute the highest rank of angel in Christianity; this likely stems from the etymology of their name, as well as their presentation in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

In Judaism, the highest ranking angels such as Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel, who are usually referred to as archangels in English, are given the title of (Hebrew: &#x27;princes&#x27;; ), to show their superior rank and status. Two examples of this can be seen in Daniel 10:13 and 12:1, where Michael, Chief of the Heavenly Host, is referred to as ( &#x27;one of the chief princes&#x27;) in the former, and ( &#x27;the great prince&#x27;) in the latter.

==Description==
Michael and Gabriel are recognized as archangels in Judaism and Islam, and by most Christians. Raphael—mentioned in the deuterocanonical/apocryphal Book of Tobit­— is also recognized as a chief angel in the Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and Eastern Orthodox churches. Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael are venerated in the Roman Catholic Church and Lutheran Churches with a feast on September 29 (between 1921 and 1969, March 24 for Gabriel and October 24 for Raphael), and in the Eastern Orthodox Church on November 8 (if the Julian calendar is used, this corresponds to November 21 in the Gregorian). The named archangels in Islam are Jibra&#x27;il, Mika&#x27;il, Israfil, and &#x27;Azra&#x27;il. Jewish literature, such as the Book of Enoch, also mentions Metatron as an archangel, called the &quot;highest of the angels&quot;, though the acceptance of this angel is not canonical in all branches of the faith.

Some branches of the faiths mentioned have identified a group of seven to eight archangels, but the named angels vary, depending on the source. Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael are always mentioned; the other archangels vary, but most commonly include Uriel and Jerahmeel, both of whom are mentioned in 2 Esdras. As well as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel, the Book of Enoch, regarded as canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (Oriental Orthodox), mentions in chapter 20: Raguel, Sariel, and Jerahmeel (Remiel).

==Zoroastrianism==

An increasing number of experts in anthropology, theology and philosophy believe that Zoroastrianism contains the earliest distillation of prehistoric belief in angels.

The Amesha Spentas (Avestan: Aməša Spəṇta, meaning &quot;beneficent immortals&quot;) of Zoroastrianism are likened to archangels. They individually inhabit immortal bodies that operate in the physical world to protect, guide, and inspire humanity and the spirit world. The Avesta explains the origin and nature of archangels or Amesha Spentas.

To maintain equilibrium, Ahura Mazda engaged in the first act of creation, distinguishing his Holy Spirit Spenta Mainyu, the Archangel of righteousness. Ahura Mazda also distinguished from himself six more Amesha Spentas, who, along with Spenta Mainyu, aided in the creation of the physical universe. Then he oversaw the development of sixteen lands, each imbued with a unique cultural catalyst calculated to encourage the formation of distinct human populations. The Amesha Spentas were charged with protecting these holy lands and through their emanation, also believed to align each respective population in service to God.

The Amesha Spentas as attributes of God are:

# Spenta Mainyu (Pahlavi: Spenamino): lit. &quot;Bountiful Spirit&quot;
# Asha Vahishta (Phl. Ardwahisht): lit. &quot;Highest Truth&quot;
# Vohu Mano (Phl. Vohuman): lit. &quot;Righteous Mind&quot;
# Khshathra Vairya (Phl. Shahrewar): lit. &quot;Desirable Dominion&quot;
# Spenta Armaiti (Phl. Spandarmad): lit. &quot;Holy Devotion&quot;
# Haurvatat (Phl. Hordad): lit. &quot;Perfection or Health&quot;
# Ameretat (Phl. Amurdad): lit. &quot;Immortality&quot;

==Judaism==
The Hebrew Bible uses the term מלאכי אלהים (&quot;malakhey Elohim&quot;; Angels of God), The Hebrew word for angel is &quot;malakh&quot;, which means messenger, for the angels מלאכי יי (&quot;malakhey Adonai&quot;; Angels of the Lord) are God&#x27;s messengers to perform various missions - e.g. &#x27;angel of death&#x27;; בני אלהים (&quot;b&#x27;nei elohim&quot;; sons of God) and הקדושים (&quot;ha-q&#x27;doshim&quot;; the holy ones) to refer to beings traditionally interpreted as &quot;angelic messengers&quot;. Other terms are used in later texts, such as העליונים (ha-elyonim, &quot;the upper ones&quot;, or &quot;the supreme ones&quot;). References to angels are uncommon in Jewish literature except in later works such as the Book of Daniel, though they are mentioned briefly in the stories of Jacob (who according to one interpretation wrestled with an angel) and Lot (who was warned by angels of the impending destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah). Daniel is the first biblical figure to refer to individual angels by name. It is therefore widely speculated that Jewish interest in angels developed during the Babylonian captivity. According to Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish of Tiberias (230–270 A.D.), specific names for the angels were brought back by the Jews from Babylon.

There are no explicit references to archangels in the canonical texts of the Hebrew Bible. In post-Biblical Judaism, certain angels came to take on a particular significance and developed unique personalities and roles. Though these archangels were believed to have ranked amongst the heavenly host, no systematic hierarchy ever developed. Metatron is considered one of the highest of the angels in Merkavah and Kabbalist mysticism and often serves as a scribe. He is briefly mentioned in the Talmud, and figures prominently in Merkavah mystical texts. Michael, who serves as a warrior and advocate for Israel, is looked upon particularly fondly. Gabriel is mentioned in the Book of Daniel and briefly in the Talmud, as well as many Merkavah mystical texts. The earliest references to archangels are in the literature of the intertestamental periods (e.g., 4 Esdras 4:36).

In the Kabbalah there are traditionally twelve archangels, who are each assigned to a certain sephira: Shubael, Raziel, Cassiel, Zadkiel, Camael, Michael, Uriel &amp; Haniel, Raphael &amp; Jophiel, Gabriel, and Azrael. There are also a variety of other archangels who share similar associations spanning throughout this tradition. Chapter 20 of the Book of Enoch mentions seven holy angels who watch, that often are considered the seven archangels: Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel, Sariel, Raguel, and Remiel. The Life of Adam and Eve lists the archangels as well: Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael and Joel. 
Medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides made a Jewish angelic hierarchy.

==Christianity==

The New Testament makes over a hundred references to angels, but uses the word &quot;archangel&quot; only twice, in (&quot;For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first&quot;, KJV) and (&quot;Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee&quot;, KJV).

===Catholic===

In Catholicism, three are mentioned by name:
* Gabriel
* Michael
* Raphael
These three are commemorated together liturgically on September 29. Each formerly had his own feast.

The latter of these identifies himself in Tobit 12:15(NAB) thus: &quot;I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who stand and serve before the Glory of the Lord.&quot;

The Fourth Book of Esdras, which mentions the angel Uriel (and also the &quot;archangel&quot; Jeremiel), was popular in the West and was frequently quoted by Church Fathers, especially Ambrose, but was never considered part of the Catholic biblical canon.

The Catholic Church gives no official recognition to the names given in some apocryphal sources, such as Raguel, Saraqael and Remiel (in the Book of Enoch) or Izidkiel, Hanael, and Kepharel (in other such sources).
In 1851 Pope Pius IX approved the Chaplet of Saint Michael, based on the 1751 apparition of the Archangel Michael experienced by the Carmelite nun Antonia d&#x27;Astonac, which includes prayers with specific invocations to the Archangels and each of the nine Choirs of Angels.

Of the three major archangels in the Catholic hierarchy of angels, all normally with large wings, Archangel Michael is easy to recognize, in armour with a weapon (sword or spear), often standing on a winged man or a dragon representing Satan, and he may carry a pair of scales to represent his role in the Last Judgement. Gabriel carries a stem of lilies, traditionally part of the iconography of the Annunciation, his most significant work as the messenger of God. The iconography of Archangel Raphael derives from the story from the Book of Tobit of Tobias and the Angel. Especially in the Renaissance, Tobias, his dog and the fish he carries may all appear, otherwise Raphael holds a walker&#x27;s staff, may wear sandals, and may carry a small container (for the healing organs from the giant fish Tobias caught).

===Eastern Orthodox===
Eastern Orthodox Tradition mentions &quot;thousands of archangels&quot;. Only Seven Archangels are venerated by name. Three are the same as mentioned in Catholicism; namely Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. Uriel is included. The other three or four are most often named Selaphiel, Jegudiel, Barachiel and (sometimes) Jeremiel. The Orthodox Church celebrates the Synaxis of the Archangel Michael and the Other Bodiless Powers on November 8 of the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the Julian Calendar, November 8 falls on November 21 of the modern Gregorian Calendar). Other feast days of the Archangels include the Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel on March 26 (April 8) and July 13 (July 26), and the Miracle of the Archangel Michael at Colossae on September 6 (September 19). In addition, every Monday throughout the year is dedicated to the Angels, with special mention being made in the church hymns of Michael and Gabriel. In Orthodox iconography, each angel has a symbolic representation:

* &quot;Michael&quot; in the Hebrew language means &quot;Who is like God?&quot; or &quot;Who is equal to God?&quot; Michael has been depicted from earliest Christian times as a commander, who holds in his right hand a spear with which he attacks Lucifer/Satan, and in his left hand a green palm branch. At the top of the spear, there is a linen ribbon with a red cross. The Archangel Michael is especially considered to be the Guardian of the Orthodox Faith and a fighter against heresies.
* &quot;Gabriel&quot; in Hebrew means &quot;God is my strength&quot; or &quot;Might of God&quot;. He is the herald of the mysteries of God, especially the Incarnation of God and all other mysteries related to it. He is depicted as follows: In his right hand, he holds a lantern with a lighted taper inside, and in his left hand, a mirror of green jasper. The mirror signifies the wisdom of God as a hidden mystery.
* &quot;Raphael&quot; is a Hebrew name which means &quot;It is God who heals&quot; or &quot;God Heals&quot;. Raphael is depicted leading Tobias (who is carrying a fish caught in the Tigris) with his right hand and holding a physician&#x27;s alabaster jar in his left hand.
* &quot;Uriel&quot; in the Hebrew language means &quot;God is my light&quot;, or &quot;Light of God&quot; (II Esdras 4:1, 5:20). He is depicted holding a sword in his right hand, and a flame in his left.
* &quot;Sealtiel&quot; means &quot;Intercessor of God&quot;. He is depicted with his face and eyes lowered, holding his hands on his bosom in prayer.
* &quot;Jegudiel&quot; means &quot;Glorifier of God&quot;. He is depicted bearing a golden wreath in his right hand and a triple-thonged whip in his left hand.
* &quot;Barachiel&quot; means &quot;Blessed by God&quot;. He is depicted holding a white rose in his hand against his breast.
* &quot;Jerahmeel&quot; means &quot;God&#x27;s exaltation&quot;. He is venerated as an inspirer and awakener of exalted thoughts that raise a person toward God (). As an &quot;eighth&quot;, he is sometimes included as an archangel.

===Coptic Orthodox===
In addition to Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, the Coptic Orthodox Church recognises four more archangels by name:
* &quot;Suriel&quot; means &quot;Prince of God&quot;
* &quot;Sadakiel&quot; means &quot;Grace of God&quot;
* &quot;Sarathiel&quot; (Unknown)
* &quot;Ananiel&quot; means &quot;Rain of God&quot;

===Ethiopian Orthodox===
The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church venerates the four archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, as well as:
* &quot;Phanuel&quot;, meaning &quot;Face of God&quot;
* &quot;Raguel&quot;, meaning &quot;Friend of God&quot;
* &quot;Remiel&quot;, meaning &quot;Thunder of God&quot;

In the canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, 1 Enoch describes Saraqael as one of the angels who watch over &quot;the spirits that sin in the spirit&quot; (Enoch 20:7–8).

===Protestant===
The Protestant Bible provides names for two angels, &quot;Michael the archangel&quot; (Jude 1:9), the angel Gabriel, who is called &quot;the man Gabriel&quot; in Daniel 9:21, which are considered part of the standard New Testament canon and Old Testament canon respectively. It omits Raphael, who is mentioned in Tobit 12:15, which falls in the Apocrypha section of the Catholic Bible, and it omits Uriel (2 Esdras 4:1 and 2 Esdras 5:20) and Jerahmeel (2 Esdras 4:36), which are contained in 2 Esdras, neither are included in the Protestant Bible. Among Protestant communities, the Anglican traditions recognize three to five angels as archangels: Michael the Archangel and Gabriel the Archangel, as well as Raphael the Archangel, Uriel the Archangel and Jerahmeel the Archangel. Lutherans only recognise Michael, Gabriel, and sometimes Raphael (not Uriel or Jerahmeel, because Esdras books are not included in the Lutheran apocrypha). Statuary of these angels can be found in Lutheran churches, and a depiction of seven archangels in stained-glass windows can be found in some Anglican churches. In this case, in addition to the aforementioned angels, Chamuel, Jophiel and Zadkiel are variously depicted. They are commemorated on 29 September, “Michaelmas”, in the church kalendar of the Lutheran and Anglican churches (cf. &quot;Calendar of saints (Lutheran)&quot; and &quot;Calendar of saints (Anglican)&quot;). 

In the view of the Baptist evangelist Billy Graham, Sacred Scripture explicitly described one being as an archangel—Michael—in Jude 1:9.

Seventh-day Adventists hold that the titles &quot;Michael&quot; and &quot;archangel&quot; are references to Jesus. In the Adventist view, they only signify his role as chief of angels and make no reference to his divine nature. Adventists credit nonconformist minister Matthew Henry as supporting this view.

===Restorationist===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, citing a reference to &quot;the voice of the archangel&quot; at 1 Thessalonians 4:16, also believe that &quot;Michael&quot; is another name for Jesus in heaven. They believe Jesus is an archangel in the true sense of the word—the supreme leader of angels.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) interprets the term &quot;archangel&quot; as meaning &quot;Chief Angel&quot;, Michael is the only individual so designated in the Latter Day Saints canon. It is believed that he is the head of all of the angels. LDS Church doctrine also states that the archangel Michael was the first man, Adam. Though no other being is identified as an &quot;archangel&quot;, Joseph Smith taught that the angel Gabriel was known in mortality as Noah and the angel Raphael is a being of significant standing, even though he has never been identified with any mortal prophet.

==Islam==
In Islam, the mentioned archangels (&quot;Karubiyin&quot;) in the Islamic exegetical traditions are:
* Gabriel (Jibrāʾīl or Jibrīl in Arabic). Gabriel is said to be the archangel responsible for transmitting God&#x27;s revelations to all prophets, including revealing the Quran to Muhammad and inducing him to recite it. Various hadiths (traditions) mention his role in delivering messages from &quot;God the Almighty&quot; to the prophets.
* Michael (Mīkāʾīl or Mīkāl in Arabic). Michael is often depicted as the archangel of mercy who is responsible for bringing rain and thunder to Earth.
* Raphael (Isrāfīl or Rafāʾīl in Arabic). The name is not mentioned in the Quran. Considered in Islam by some to be the angel of the trumpet responsible for signalling the coming of Judgment Day.
* Azrael (ʿAzrāʾīl in Arabic, also called Malak al-Mawt, literally “angel of death”). Taking the soul of the dead to heaven or hell in the intermediary realm (&quot;Barzakh&quot;).

==Gnosticism==
In the Gnostic codex &quot;On the Origin of the World&quot;, the aeon named Sophia sends seven archangels from her light to save the Archon Sabaoth, the son of Yaldabaoth, after the authorities of Chaos make war in the Seven Heavens. He is then placed in a divine kingdom above the twelve gods of Chaos and becomes the consort of Zoe (the primordial Eve), who gives him knowledge of the eighth heaven, while the seven archangels stand before them. In the &quot;Sophia of Jesus Christ&quot; and &quot;Eugnostos the Blessed&quot;, the primordial Adam creates myriads of gods and archangels without number.

==Occultism==
Occultists sometimes associate archangels in Kabbalistic fashion with various seasons or elements, or even colours. In some Kabbalah-based systems of ceremonial magic, the main four (Gabriel, Michael, Raphael and Uriel) are invoked to guard the four quarters (directions) and their corresponding colours are associated with magical properties. In the lesser ritual of the pentagram, the invocation includes: &quot;Before me Raphael; Behind me Gabriel; On my right hand Michael; On my left hand Uriel.&quot;

<text>In logic, negation, also called the logical not or logical complement, is an operation that takes a proposition formula_1 to another proposition &quot;not formula_1&quot;, written formula_3, formula_4, formula_5 or formula_6. It is interpreted intuitively as being true when formula_1 is false, and false when formula_1 is true. For example, if formula_1 is &quot;Spot runs&quot;, then &quot;not formula_1&quot; is &quot;Spot does not run&quot;. An operand of a negation is called a negand or negatum.

Negation is a unary logical connective. It may furthermore be applied not only to propositions, but also to notions, truth values, or semantic values more generally. In classical logic, negation is normally identified with the truth function that takes &quot;truth&quot; to &quot;falsity&quot; (and vice versa). In intuitionistic logic, according to the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation, the negation of a proposition formula_1 is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of formula_1.

==Definition==
&quot;Classical negation&quot; is an operation on one logical value, typically the value of a proposition, that produces a value of &quot;true&quot; when its operand is false, and a value of &quot;false&quot; when its operand is true. Thus if statement formula_1 is true, then formula_3 (pronounced &quot;not P&quot;) would then be false; and conversely, if formula_3 is true, then formula_1 would be false.

The truth table of formula_3 is as follows:

Negation can be defined in terms of other logical operations. For example, formula_3 can be defined as formula_19 (where formula_20 is logical consequence and formula_21 is absolute falsehood). Conversely, one can define formula_21 as formula_23 for any proposition (where formula_24 is logical conjunction). The idea here is that any contradiction is false, and while these ideas work in both classical and intuitionistic logic, they do not work in paraconsistent logic, where contradictions are not necessarily false. As a further example, negation can be defined in terms of NAND and can also be defined in terms of NOR.

 Algebraically, classical negation corresponds to complementation in a Boolean algebra, and intuitionistic negation to pseudocomplementation in a Heyting algebra. These algebras provide a semantics for classical and intuitionistic logic.

==Notation==
The negation of a proposition is notated in different ways, in various contexts of discussion and fields of application. The following table documents some of these variants:

The notation formula_25 is Polish notation.

In set theory, formula_26 is also used to indicate &#x27;not in the set of&#x27;: formula_27 is the set of all members of that are not members of .

Regardless how it is notated or symbolized, the negation formula_3 can be read as &quot;it is not the case that &quot;, &quot;not that &quot;, or usually more simply as &quot;not &quot;.

===Precedence===

As a way of reducing the number of necessary parentheses, one may introduce precedence rules: ¬ has higher precedence than ∧, ∧ higher than ∨, and ∨ higher than →. So for example, formula_29 is short for formula_30

Here is a table that shows a commonly used precedence of logical operators.
==Properties==

===Double negation===

Within a system of classical logic, double negation, that is, the negation of the negation of a proposition formula_1, is logically equivalent to formula_1. Expressed in symbolic terms, formula_33. In intuitionistic logic, a proposition implies its double negation, but not conversely. This marks one important difference between classical and intuitionistic negation. Algebraically, classical negation is called an involution of period two.

However, in intuitionistic logic, the weaker equivalence formula_34 does hold. This is because in intuitionistic logic, formula_3 is just a shorthand for formula_19, and we also have formula_37. Composing that last implication with triple negation formula_38 implies that formula_19 .

As a result, in the propositional case, a sentence is classically provable if its double negation is intuitionistically provable. This result is known as Glivenko&#x27;s theorem.

===Distributivity===

De Morgan&#x27;s laws provide a way of distributing negation over disjunction and conjunction:

:formula_40,  and
:formula_41.

===Linearity===
Let formula_42 denote the logical xor operation. In Boolean algebra, a linear function is one such that:

If there exists formula_43,
formula_44,
for all formula_45.

Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the truth-value of the operation, or it never makes a difference. Negation is a linear logical operator.

===Self dual===
In Boolean algebra, a self dual function is a function such that:

formula_46 for all
formula_47.
Negation is a self dual logical operator.

=== Negations of quantifiers ===
In first-order logic, there are two quantifiers, one is the universal quantifier formula_48 (means &quot;for all&quot;) and the other is the existential quantifier formula_49 (means &quot;there exists&quot;). The negation of one quantifier is the other quantifier (formula_50 and formula_51). For example, with the predicate &quot;P&quot; as &quot;&quot;x&quot; is mortal&quot; and the domain of x as the collection of all humans, formula_52 means &quot;a person x in all humans is mortal&quot; or &quot;all humans are mortal&quot;. The negation of it is formula_50, meaning &quot;there exists a person &quot;x&quot; in all humans who is not mortal&quot;, or &quot;there exists someone who lives forever&quot;.

==Rules of inference==

There are a number of equivalent ways to formulate rules for negation. One usual way to formulate classical negation in a natural deduction setting is to take as primitive rules of inference &quot;negation introduction&quot; (from a derivation of formula_1 to both formula_55 and formula_56, infer formula_3; this rule also being called &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;), &quot;negation elimination&quot; (from formula_1 and formula_3 infer formula_55; this rule also being called &quot;ex falso quodlibet&quot;), and &quot;double negation elimination&quot; (from formula_61 infer formula_1). One obtains the rules for intuitionistic negation the same way but by excluding double negation elimination.

Negation introduction states that if an absurdity can be drawn as conclusion from formula_1 then formula_1 must not be the case (i.e. formula_1 is false (classically) or refutable (intuitionistically) or etc.). Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using a primitive absurdity sign formula_21. In this case the rule says that from formula_1 and formula_3 follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule, namely that anything follows from an absurdity.

Typically the intuitionistic negation formula_3 of formula_1 is defined as formula_19. Then negation introduction and elimination are just special cases of implication introduction (conditional proof) and elimination (&quot;modus ponens&quot;). In this case one must also add as a primitive rule &quot;ex falso quodlibet&quot;.

==Programming language and ordinary language==

As in mathematics, negation is used in computer science to construct logical statements.
if (!(r == t))
 /*...statements executed when r does NOT equal t...*/


The exclamation mark &quot;codice_1&quot; signifies logical NOT in B, C, and languages with a C-inspired syntax such as C++, Java, JavaScript, Perl, and PHP. &quot;codice_2&quot; is the operator used in ALGOL 60, BASIC, and languages with an ALGOL- or BASIC-inspired syntax such as Pascal, Ada, Eiffel and Seed7. Some languages (C++, Perl, etc.) provide more than one operator for negation. A few languages like PL/I and Ratfor use codice_3 for negation. Most modern languages allow the above statement to be shortened from codice_4 to codice_5, which allows sometimes, when the compiler/interpreter is not able to optimize it, faster programs.

In computer science there is also &quot;bitwise negation&quot;. This takes the value given and switches all the binary 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s. This is often used to create ones&#x27; complement (or &quot;codice_6&quot; in C or C++) and two&#x27;s complement (just simplified to &quot;codice_7&quot; or the negative sign, as this is equivalent to taking the arithmetic negation of the number).

To get the absolute (positive equivalent) value of a given integer the following would work as the &quot;codice_7&quot; changes it from negative to positive (it is negative because &quot;codice_9&quot; yields true)
unsigned int abs(int x)
 if (x &lt; 0)
 return -x;
 else
 return x;


To demonstrate logical negation:
unsigned int abs(int x)
 if (!(x &lt; 0))
 return x;
 else
 return -x;


Inverting the condition and reversing the outcomes produces code that is logically equivalent to the original code, i.e. will have identical results for any input (depending on the compiler used, the actual instructions performed by the computer may differ).

In C (and some other languages descended from C), double negation (codice_10) is used as an idiom to convert codice_11 to a canonical Boolean, ie. an integer with a value of either 0 or 1 and no other. Although any integer other than 0 is logically true in C and 1 is not special in this regard, it is sometimes important to ensure that a canonical value is used, for example for printing or if the number is subsequently used for arithmetic operations.
The convention of using codice_1 to signify negation occasionally surfaces in ordinary written speech, as computer-related slang for &quot;not&quot;. For example, the phrase codice_13 means &quot;not voting&quot;. Another example is the phrase codice_14 which is used as a synonym for &quot;no-clue&quot; or &quot;clueless&quot;.

==Kripke semantics==
In Kripke semantics where the semantic values of formulae are sets of possible worlds, negation can be taken to mean set-theoretic complementation (see also possible world semantics for more).

<doc id="161022" wikidata="Q12444025" url="?curid=161022" title="Indian independence movement">
<text>The Indian independence movement was a series of historic events in South Asia with the ultimate aim of ending British colonial rule. It lasted until 1947, when the Indian Independence Act 1947 was passed.

The first nationalistic movement for Indian independence emerged in the Province of Bengal. It later took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more economic rights for natives. The first half of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards self-rule.

The stages of the independence struggle in the 1920s were characterised by the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Congress&#x27;s adoption of Gandhi&#x27;s policy of non-violence and civil disobedience. Some of the leading followers of Gandhi&#x27;s ideology were Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Maulana Azad, and others. Intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness. Female leaders like Sarojini Naidu, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Pritilata Waddedar, and Kasturba Gandhi promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in the freedom struggle.

Few leaders followed a more violent approach, which became especially popular after the Rowlatt Act, which permitted indefinite detention. The Act sparked protests across India, especially in the Punjab Province, where they were violently suppressed in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

The Indian independence movement was in constant ideological evolution. Essentially anti-colonial, it was supplemented by visions of independent, economic development with a secular, democratic, republican, and civil-libertarian political structure. After the 1930s, the movement took on a strong socialist orientation. It culminated in the Indian Independence Act 1947, which ended Crown suzerainty and partitioned British India into the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. On 26 January 1950, the Constitution of India established the Republic of India. Pakistan adopted its first constitution in 1956. In 1971, East Pakistan declared its own independence as Bangladesh.

==Background==

The first European to reach India via the Atlantic Ocean was the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who reached Calicut in 1498 in search of spice. Just over a century later, the Dutch and English established trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent, with the first English trading post set up at Surat in 1613.

Over the next two centuries, the British defeated the Portuguese and Dutch but remained in conflict with the French. The decline of the Mughal Empire in the first half of the eighteenth century allowed the British to establish a foothold in Indian politics. During the Battle of Plassey, the East India Company&#x27;s Army defeated Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, and the company established itself as a major player in Indian affairs. After the Battle of Buxar of 1764, it gained administrative rights over Bengal, Bihar and the Midnapur part of Odisha.

After the defeat of Tipu Sultan, most of southern India came either under the company&#x27;s direct rule, or under its indirect political control in a subsidiary alliance. The Company subsequently seized control of regions ruled by the Maratha Empire, after defeating them in a series of wars. Much of Punjab was annexed in the year 1849, after the defeat of Sikh armies in the First (1845–46) and Second (1848–49) Anglo-Sikh Wars.

== Early Independence Movements==
Maveeran Alagumuthu Kone was an early revolutionary against the British presence in Tamil Nadu. He became a military leader in the town of Ettayapuram and was defeated in battle against the British and Maruthanayagam&#x27;s forces. He was executed in 1757. Puli Thevar opposed the Nawab of Arcot, who was supported by the British. Maruthanayagam Pillai was a commandant of the British East India Company&#x27;s Madras Army. He was born in a Tamil Vellalar caste family in a village called Panaiyur in British India, what is now in Nainarkoil Taluk, Ramanathapuram District of Tamil Nadu, India. He converted to Islam and was named Muhammad Yusuf Khan. He was popularly known as Khan Sahib when he became a ruler of Madurai. He became a warrior in the Arcot troops, and later a commandant for the British East India Company troops. The British and the Arcot Nawab employed him to suppress the Polygar (a.k.a. Palayakkarar) uprising in South India. Later he was entrusted to administer the Madurai country when the Madurai Nayak rule ended. He later fought war against the British and the Arcot Nawab. A dispute arose with the British and Arcot Nawab, and three of Khan&#x27;s associates were bribed to capture him. He was captured during his morning prayer (Thozhugai) and hanged on 15 October 1764 at Sammatipuram near Madurai. Local legends state that he survived two earlier attempts at hanging, and that the Nawab feared Yusuf Khan would come back to life and so had his body dismembered and buried in different locations around Tamil Nadu. 
In Eastern India and across the country, Indigenous communities organised numerous uprising against the British and their fellow members, especially landlords and moneylenders. One of the earliest of these on record was led by Binsu Manki around 1771 over the transfer of Jharkhand to the East India Company. The Rangpur Dhing took place from 1782 to 1783 in nearby Rangpur, Bengal. Following Binsu Manki&#x27;s revolt in Jharkhand, numerous uprisings across the region took place, including the rebellion led by Tilka Manjhi in 1784; Bhumij Revolt of Manbhum from 1798 to 1799; the Chero Uprising of Palamu in 1800 under the leadership of Bhukan Singh, and two uprising of the Munda community in Tamar region, during 1807 led by Dukan Mank, and 1819–20 under the leadership Bundu and Konta. The Ho Rebellion took place when the Ho community first came in contact with the British, from 1820 to 1821 near Chaibasa on the Roro River in West Singhbhum, but were defeated by the technologically enhanced colonial cavalry. A larger Bhumij Revolt occurred near Midnapur in Bengal, under the leadership of Ganga Narain Singh who had previously also been involved in co-leading the Chuar Rebellions in these regions from 1771 to 1809. Syed Mir Nisar Ali Titumir was an Islamic preacher who led a peasant uprising against the Hindu Zamindars of Bengal and the British during the 19th century. Along with his followers, he built a bamboo fort (&quot;Bansher Kella&quot; in Bengali) in Narkelberia Village, which gained a prominent place into Bengali folk legend. After the storming of the fort by British soldiers, Titumir died of his wounds on 19 November 1831. These rebellions lead to larger regional movements in Jharkhand and beyond such as the Kol Insurrection led by Singhray and Binray Manki, where the Kol (Munda, Oraon, Bhumij and Ho communities) united to rebel against the &quot;outsiders&quot; from 1830 -1833.

The Santhal Hul was a movement of over 60,000 Santhals that happened from 1855 to 1857 (but started as early as 1784) and was particularly led by siblings – brothers Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand and Bhairav and their sisters Phulo and Jhano from the Murmu clan in its most fervent years that lead up to the Revolt of 1857. More than 100 years of such escalating rebellions created grounds for a large, impactful, millenarian movement in Eastern India that again shook the foundations of British rule in the region, under the leadership of Birsa Munda. Birsa Munda belonged to the Munda community and lead thousands of people from Munda, Oraon, and Kharia communities in &quot;Ulgulaan&quot; (revolt) against British political expansion and those who advanced it, against forceful conversions of Indigenous peoples into Christianity (even creating a Birsaite movement), and against the displacement of Indigenous peoples from their lands. To subdue these rising tensions which were getting increasingly out of control of the British, they aggressively set out to search for Birsa Munda, even setting up a reward for him. They brutally attacked the Dombari Hills where Birsa had repaired a water tank and made his revolutionary headquarters between 7–9 January 1900, murdering a minimum of 400 of the Munda warriors who had congregated there, akin to the attacks on the people at Jallianwallah Bagh, however, receiving much less attention. The hills are known as &quot;Topped Buru&quot; today – the mound of the dead. Birsa was ultimately captured in the Jamkopai forest in Singhbhum, and assassinated by the British in jail in 1900, with a rushed cremation/burial conducted to ensure his movement was subdued.

The toughest resistance the Company experienced was offered by Mysore. The Anglo-Mysore Wars were a series of wars fought in over the last three decades of the 18th century between the Kingdom of Mysore on the one hand, and the British East India Company (represented chiefly by the Madras Presidency), and Maratha Confederacy and the Nizam of Hyderabad on the other. Hyder Ali and his successor Tipu Sultan fought a war on four fronts with the British attacking from the west, south, and east, while the Marathas and the Nizam&#x27;s forces attacked from the north. The fourth war resulted in the overthrow of the house of Hyder Ali and Tipu (who was killed in the final war, in 1799), and the dismantlement of Mysore to the benefit of the East India Company, which won and took control of much of India. Pazhassi Raja was the prince regent of the princely state of Cotiote in North Malabar, near Kannur, India between 1774 and 1805. He fought a guerrilla war with tribal people from Wynad supporting him. He was captured by the British and his fort was razed to the ground.

In 1766 the Nizam of Hyderabad transferred the Northern Circars to the British authority. The independent king Jagannatha Gajapati Narayan Deo II of Paralakhemundi estate situated in today&#x27;s Odisha and in the northernmost region of the then political division was continuously revolting against the French occupants since 1753 as per the Nizam&#x27;s earlier handover of his estate to them on similar grounds. Narayan Deo II fought the British at Jelmur fort on 4 April 1768 and was defeated due to superior firepower of the British. He fled to the tribal hinterlands of his estate and continued his efforts against the British until his natural death on the Fifth of December 1771.

Rani Velu Nachiyar (1730–1796), was a queen of Sivaganga from 1760 to 1790. Rani Nachiyar was trained in war match weapons usage, martial arts like Valari, Silambam (fighting using stick), horse riding and archery. She was a scholar in many languages and she had proficiency with languages like French, English, and Urdu. When her husband, Muthuvaduganathaperiya Udaiyathevar, was killed in battle with British soldiers and the forces of the Nawab of Arcot, she was drawn into battle. She formed an army and sought an alliance with Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali with the aim of attacking the British, whom she successfully challenged in 1780. When the inventories of the Britishers were discovered, she is said to have arranged a suicide attack by a faithful follower, Kuyili, dousing herself in oil and setting herself alight and walking into the storehouse. Rani formed a women&#x27;s army named &quot;Udaiyaal&quot; in honour of her adopted daughter, who had died detonating a British arsenal. Rani Nachiyar was one of the few rulers who regained her kingdom, and ruled it for a decade more.

Veerapandiya Kattabomman was an eighteenth-century Polygar and chieftain from Panchalankurichi in Tamil Nadu, India who waged the Polygar war against the East India Company. He was captured by the British and hanged in 1799 CE. Kattabomman refused to accept the sovereignty of East India Company, and fought against them. Dheeran Chinnamalai was a Kongu Nadu chieftain and Palayakkarar from Tamil Nadu who fought against the East India Company. After Kattabomman and Tipu Sultan&#x27;s deaths, Chinnamalai sought the help of Marathas and Maruthu Pandiyar to attack the British at Coimbatore in 1800. The British forces managed to stop the armies of the allies, forcing Chinnamalai to attack Coimbatore on his own. His army was defeated and he escaped from the British forces. Chinnamalai engaged in guerrilla warfare and defeated the British in battles at Cauvery in 1801, Odanilai in 1802 and Arachalur in 1804.

In 1804 the King of Khordha, Kalinga was deprived of his traditional rights to the Jagannath Temple. In retaliation, a group of armed Paiks attacked the British at Pipili. Jayee Rajguru, the chief of Army of Kalinga requested a common alliance against the British. After Rajguru&#x27;s death, Bakshi Jagabandhu launched an armed revolution against the East India Company&#x27;s rule in Odisha. This is now known as the Paik Rebellion, the first uprising against the British East India Company.


===Rebellion of 1857===

The Indian war of independence of 1857 was a large uprising in northern and central India against the East India Company. The conditions of service in the company&#x27;s army and cantonments had increasingly come into conflict with the religious beliefs and prejudices of the sepoys. The predominance of members from the upper castes in the army, perceived loss of caste due to overseas deployment, and rumours of secret designs of the government to convert them to Christianity led to growing discontent. The sepoys were also disillusioned by their low salaries and the racial discrimination practised by British officers in matters of promotion and privileges.

The indifference of the British towards native Indian rulers and the annexation of Oudh furthered dissent. The Marquess of Dalhousie&#x27;s policy of annexation, the doctrine of lapse and the projected removal of the Mughals from their ancestral palace at Red Fort also led to popular anger.

The final spark was provided by the rumoured use of tallow (from cows) and lard (pig fat) in the newly introduced Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle cartridges. Soldiers had to bite the cartridges with their teeth before loading them into their rifles, ingesting the fat. This was sacrilegious to both Hindus and Muslims.

Mangal Pandey was sepoy who played a key part in the events immediately preceding the outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857. His defiance to his British superiors and later his execution ignited the fire for 1857 Indian Rebellion.

On 10 May 1857, the sepoys at Meerut broke ranks and turned on their commanding officers, killing some of them. They reached Delhi on 11 May, set the company&#x27;s toll house on fire, and marched into the Red Fort, where they asked the Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah II, to become their leader and reclaim his throne. The emperor eventually agreed and was proclaimed &quot;Shahenshah-e-Hindustan&quot; by the rebels. The rebels also murdered much of the European, Eurasian, and Christian population of the city, including natives who had converted to Christianity.

Revolts broke out in other parts of Oudh and the North-Western Provinces as well, where civil rebellion followed the mutinies, leading to popular uprisings. The British were initially caught off-guard and were thus slow to react, but eventually responded with force. The lack of effective organisation among the rebels, coupled with the military superiority of the British, brought an end to the rebellion. The British fought the main army of the rebels near Delhi, and after prolonged fighting and a siege, defeated them and reclaimed the city on 20 September 1857. Subsequently, revolts in other centres were also crushed. The last significant battle was fought in Gwalior on 17 June 1858, during which Rani Lakshmibai was killed. Sporadic fighting and guerrilla warfare, led by Tatya Tope, continued until spring 1859, but most of the rebels were eventually subdued.

The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a turning point. While affirming the military and political power of the British, it led to a significant change in how India was to be controlled by them. Under the Government of India Act 1858, the East India Company&#x27;s territory was transferred to the British government. At the apex of the new system was a Cabinet minister, the Secretary of State for India, who was to be formally advised by a statutory council; the Governor-General of India (Viceroy) was made responsible to him, while he in turn was responsible to the government.

In a royal proclamation made to the people of India, Queen Victoria promised equal opportunity of public service under British law, and also pledged to respect the rights of native princes. The British stopped the policy of seizing land from the princes, decreed religious tolerance and began to admit Indians into the civil service. However, they also increased the number of British soldiers in relation to native Indian ones, and allowed only British soldiers to handle artillery. Bahadur Shah II was exiled to Rangoon where he died in 1862.

In 1876 the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli proclaimed Queen Victoria the Empress of India. The British Liberals objected as the title was foreign to British traditions.
==Rise of organised movements==
The decades following the Rebellion were a period of growing political awareness, the manifestation of Indian public opinion and the emergence of Indian leadership at both national and provincial levels. Dadabhai Naoroji formed the East India Association in 1866 and Surendranath Banerjee founded the Indian National Association in 1876. Inspired by a suggestion made by A.O. Hume, a retired Scottish civil servant, seventy-two Indian delegates met in Bombay in 1885 and founded the Indian National Congress. They were mostly members of the upwardly mobile and successful western-educated provincial elites, engaged in professions such as law, teaching and journalism. At its inception, Congress had no well-defined ideology and commanded few of the resources essential to a political organisation. Instead, it functioned more as a debating society that met annually to express its loyalty to the British and passed numerous resolutions on less controversial issues such as civil rights or opportunities in government (especially in the civil service). These resolutions were submitted to the Indian government and occasionally to the British Parliament, but the Congress&#x27;s early gains were slight. &quot;Despite its claim to represent all India, the Congress voiced the interests of urban elites; the number of participants from other social and economic backgrounds remained negligible. However, this period of history is still crucial because it represented the first political mobilisation of Indians, coming from all parts of the subcontinent and the first articulation of the idea of India as one nation, rather than a collection of independent princely states.Religious groups played a role in reforming Indian society. These were of several religions from Hindu groups such as the &quot;Arya Samaj&quot;, the &quot;Brahmo Samaj&quot;, to other religions, such as the Namdhari (or &quot;Kuka&quot;) sect of Sikhism. The work of men like Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Sri Aurobindo, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai, Subramanya Bharathy, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Rabindranath Tagore and Dadabhai Naoroji, as well as women such as the Scots–Irish Sister Nivedita, spread the passion for rejuvenation and freedom. The rediscovery of India&#x27;s indigenous history by several European and Indian scholars also fed into the rise of nationalism among Indians.

The triumvirate also is known as Lal Bal Pal (Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai), along with V. O. Chidambaram Pillai, Sri Aurobindo, Surendranath Banerjee, and Rabindranath Tagore were some of the prominent leaders of movements in the early 20th century. The Swadeshi movement was the most successful. The name of Lokmanya began spreading around and people started following him in all parts of the country.

The Indian textile industry also played an important role in the freedom struggle of India. The merchandise of the textile industry pioneered the Industrial Revolution in India and soon England was producing cotton cloth in such great quantities that the domestic market was saturated, and the products had to be sold in foreign markets.

On the other hand, India was rich in cotton production and was in a position to supply British mills with the raw material they required. This was the time when India was under British rule and the East India Company had already established its roots in India. Raw materials were exported to England at very low rates while cotton cloth of refined quality was imported to India and sold at very high prices. This was draining India&#x27;s economy, causing the textile industry of India to suffer greatly. This led to great resentment among cotton cultivators and traders.

After Lord Curzon announced the partition of Bengal in 1905, there was massive opposition from the people of Bengal. Initially, the partition plan was opposed through press campaign. The total follower of such techniques led to the boycott of British goods and the people of India pledged to use only swadeshi or Indian goods and to wear only Indian cloth. Imported garments were viewed with hate. At many places, public burnings of foreign cloth were organised. Shops selling foreign cloths were closed. The cotton textile industry is rightly described as the Swadeshi industry. The period witnessed the growth of swadeshi textile mills. Swadeshi factories came into existence everywhere.

According to Surendranath Banerji, the Swadeshi movement changed the entire texture of Indian social and domestic life. The songs composed by Rabindranath Tagore, Rajanikanta Sen and Syed Abu Mohd became the moving spirit for the nationalists. The movement soon spread to the rest of the country and the partition of Bengal had to be firmly inhaled on the first of April 1912.

==Rise of Indian nationalism==
By 1900, although the Congress had emerged as an all-India political organisation, it did not have the support of most Indian Muslims. Attacks by Hindu reformers against religious conversion, cow slaughter, and the preservation of Urdu in Arabic script deepened their concerns of minority status and denial of rights if the Congress alone were to represent the people of India. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan launched a movement for Muslim regeneration that culminated in the founding in 1875 of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh (renamed Aligarh Muslim University in 1920). Its objective was to educate students by emphasising the compatibility of Islam with modern western knowledge. The diversity among India&#x27;s Muslims, however, made it impossible to bring about uniform cultural and intellectual regeneration.

The Hindu faction of the Independence movement was led by Nationalist leader Lokmanya Tilak, who was regarded as the &quot;father of Indian Unrest&quot; by the British. Along with Tilak were leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was the inspiration, political mentor and role model of Mahatma Gandhi and inspired several other freedom activists. 
Nationalistic sentiments among Congress members led to a push to be represented in the bodies of government, as well as to have a say in the legislation and administration of India. Congressmen saw themselves as loyalists, but wanted an active role in governing their own country, albeit as part of the Empire. This trend was personified by Dadabhai Naoroji, who went as far as contesting, successfully, an election to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, becoming its first Indian member.

Dadabhai Naoroji was the first Indian nationalist to embrace &quot;Swaraj&quot; as the destiny of the nation. Bal Gangadhar Tilak deeply opposed a British education system that ignored and defamed India&#x27;s culture, history, and values. He resented the denial of freedom of expression for nationalists, and the lack of any voice or role for ordinary Indians in the affairs of their nation. For these reasons, he considered Swaraj as the natural and only solution. His popular sentence &quot;Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it&quot; became the source of inspiration for Indians.
In 1907, Congress was split into two factions: The &quot;radicals&quot;, led by Tilak, advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the British Empire and the abandonment of all British goods. This movement gained traction and huge following of the masses in the western and eastern parts of India. The &quot;moderates&quot;, led by leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, on the other hand, wanted reform within the framework of British rule. Tilak was backed by rising public leaders like Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai, who held the same point of view. Under them, India&#x27;s three great states – Maharashtra, Bengal and Punjab shaped the demand of the people and India&#x27;s nationalism. Gokhale criticised Tilak for encouraging acts of violence and armed resistance. But the Congress of 1906 did not have public membership, and thus Tilak and his supporters were forced to leave the party.But with Tilak&#x27;s arrest, all hopes for an Indian offensive were stalled. The Indian National Congress lost credibility with the people. A Muslim deputation met with the Viceroy, Minto (1905–10), seeking concessions from the impending constitutional reforms, including special considerations in government service and electorates. The British recognised some of the Muslim League&#x27;s petitions by increasing the number of elective offices reserved for Muslims in the Indian Councils Act 1909. The Muslim League insisted on its separateness from the Hindu-dominated Congress, as the voice of a &quot;nation within a nation&quot;.

The Ghadar Party was formed overseas in 1913 to fight for the Independence of India with members coming from the United States and Canada, as well as Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Members of the party aimed for Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim unity against the British.

In colonial India, the All India Conference of Indian Christians (AICIC), which was founded in 1914, played a role in the Indian independence movement, advocating for swaraj and opposing the partition of India. The AICIC also was opposed to separate electorates for Christians, believing that the faithful &quot;should participate as common citizens in the one common, national political system&quot;. The All India Conference of Indian Christians and the All India Catholic Union formed a working committee with M. Rahnasamy of Andhra University serving as president and B.L. Rallia Ram of Lahore serving as general secretary. In its meeting on 16 and 17 April 1947, the joint committee prepared a 13-point memorandum that was sent to the Constituent Assembly of India, which asked for religious freedom for both organisations and individuals; this came to be reflected in the Constitution of India.

The temperance movement in India became aligned with Indian nationalism under the direction of Mahatma Gandhi, who saw alcohol as a foreign importation to the culture of the subcontinent.

===Partition of Bengal, 1905===

In July 1905, Lord Curzon, the Viceroy and Governor-General (1899–1905), ordered the partition of the province of Bengal. The stated aim was to improve administration. However, this was seen as an attempt to quench nationalistic sentiment through divide and rule. The Bengali Hindu intelligentsia exerted considerable influence on local and national politics. The partition outraged Bengalis. Widespread agitation ensued in the streets and in the press, and the Congress advocated boycotting British products under the banner of &quot;swadeshi&quot;, or indigenous industries. A growing movement emerged, focussing on indigenous Indian industries, finance, and education, which saw the founding of National Council of Education, the birth of Indian financial institutions and banks, as well as an interest in Indian culture and achievements in science and literature. Hindus showed unity by tying Rakhi on each other&#x27;s wrists and observing &quot;Arandhan&quot; (not cooking any food). During this time, Bengali Hindu nationalists like Sri Aurobindo, Bhupendranath Datta, and Bipin Chandra Pal began writing virulent newspaper articles challenging the legitimacy of British rule in India in publications such as &quot;Jugantar&quot; and &quot;Sandhya&quot;, and were charged with sedition.

The Partition also precipitated increasing activity from the then still Nascent militant nationalist revolutionary movement, which was particularly gaining strength in Bengal and Maharashtra from the last decade of the 1800s. In Bengal, , led by brothers Aurobindo and Barin Ghosh organised a number of attacks of figureheads of the Raj, culminating in the attempt on the life of a British judge in Muzaffarpur. This precipitated the Alipore bomb case, whilst a number of revolutionaries were killed, or captured and put on trial. Revolutionaries like Khudiram Bose, Prafulla Chaki, Kanailal Dutt who were either killed or hanged became household names.

The British newspaper, &quot;The Empire&quot;, wrote:

===Jugantar===

Jugantar was a paramilitary organisation. Led by Barindra Ghosh, with 21 revolutionaries, including Bagha Jatin, started to collect arms and explosives and manufactured bombs.

Some senior members of the group were sent abroad for political and military training. One of them, Hemchandra Kanungo obtained his training in Paris. After returning to Kolkata he set up a combined religious school and bomb factory at a garden house in Maniktala suburb of Calcutta. However, the attempted murder of district Judge Kingsford of Muzaffarpur by Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki (30 April 1908) initiated a police investigation that led to the arrest of many of the revolutionaries.
Bagha Jatin was one of the senior leaders in Jugantar. He was arrested, along with several other leaders, in connection with the Howrah-Sibpur Conspiracy case. They were tried for treason, the charge being that they had incited various regiments of the army against the ruler.

===Alipore bomb conspiracy case===

Several leaders of the Jugantar party including Aurobindo Ghosh were arrested in connection with bomb-making activities in Kolkata. Several of the activists were deported to the Andaman Cellular Jail.

===Delhi-Lahore conspiracy case===
The Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy, hatched in 1912, planned to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge, on the occasion of transferring the capital of British India from Calcutta to New Delhi. Involving revolutionary underground in Bengal and headed by Rash Behari Bose along with Sachin Sanyal, the conspiracy culminated on the attempted assassination on 23 December 1912, when the ceremonial procession moved through the Chandni Chowk suburb of Delhi. The Viceroy escaped with his injuries, along with Lady Hardinge, although the Mahout was killed.

The investigations in the aftermath of the assassination attempt led to the Delhi Conspiracy trial. Basant Kumar Biswas was convicted of having thrown the bomb and executed, along with Amir Chand Bombwal and Avadh Behari for their roles in the conspiracy.

===Howrah gang case===
Most of the eminent Jugantar leaders including Bagha Jatin alias Jatindra Nath Mukherjee who were not arrested earlier, were arrested in 1910, in connection with the murder of Shamsul Alam. Thanks to Bagha Jatin&#x27;s new policy of a decentralised federated action, most of the accused were released in 1911.

==All India Muslim League==
The All-India Muslim League was founded by the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference at Dacca (now Dhaka, Bangladesh), in 1906. Being a political party to secure the interests of the Muslim in British India, the Muslim League played a decisive role behind the creation of Pakistan in the Indian subcontinent.

In 1916, Muhammad Ali Jinnah joined the Indian National Congress, which was the largest Indian political organisation. Like most of the Congress at the time, Jinnah did not favour outright self-rule, considering British influences on education, law, culture, and industry as beneficial to India. Jinnah became a member of the sixty-member Imperial Legislative Council. The council had no real power or authority, and included a large number of unelected pro-Raj loyalists and Europeans. Nevertheless, Jinnah was instrumental in the passing of the &quot;Child Marriages Restraint Act&quot;, the legitimisation of the Muslim waqf (religious endowments) and was appointed to the Sandhurst committee, which helped establish the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun. During the First World War, Jinnah joined other Indian moderates in supporting the British war effort.

==First World War==

The initial response throughout India to Lord Hardinge&#x27;s announcement was, for the most part, enthusiastic support. Indian princes volunteered their men, money, and personal service. Support from the Congress Party was primarily offered on the hopes that Britain would repay such loyal assistance with substantial political concessions—if not immediate independence or at least dominion status following the war, then surely its promise soon after the Allies achieved victory. Contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt, Indians contributed considerably to the British war effort by providing men and resources. About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. The major threat for the British Government in South Asia came from the armed tribes in North Western frontier and Afghanistan. The source of the second potential threat for the colonial government was the Indian Muslims whom the British believed shall sympathise with the Ottoman Empire.. Nationalism in Bengal, increasingly associated with the unrest in Punjab, was of significant ferocity to almost complete the paralysis of the regional administration. Meanwhile, failed conspiracies were triggered by revolutionaries lack of preparedness to organise a nationalist revolt.

None of the revolutionary conspiracies made a significant impact inside India. The prospect that subversive violence would have an effect on a popular war effort drew support from the Indian population for special measures against anti-colonial activities in the form of Defence of India Act 1915. There were no major mutinies occurring during wartime, yet conspiracies exacerbated profound fears of insurrection among British officials, preparing them to use extreme force to frighten Indians into submission.

=== Hindu–German Conspiracy ===

The Hindu–German Conspiracy, was a series of plans between 1914 and 1917 by Indian nationalist groups to attempt Pan-Indian rebellion against the British Raj during World War I, formulated between the Indian revolutionary underground and exiled or self-exiled nationalists who formed, in the United States, the Ghadar Party, and in Germany, the Indian independence committee, in the decade preceding the Great War. The conspiracy was drawn up at the beginning of the war, with extensive support from the German Foreign Office, the German consulate in San Francisco, as well as some support from Ottoman Turkey and the Irish republican movement. The most prominent plan attempted to foment unrest and trigger a Pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian Army from Punjab to Singapore. This plot was planned to be executed in February 1915 with the aim of overthrowing British rule over the Indian subcontinent. The February mutiny was ultimately thwarted when British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadarite movement and arrested key figures. Mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within India were also crushed.

Other related events include the 1915 Singapore Mutiny, the Annie Larsen arms plot, the Jugantar–German plot, the German mission to Kabul, the mutiny of the Connaught Rangers in India, as well as, by some accounts, the Black Tom explosion in 1916. Parts of the conspiracy included efforts to subvert the British Indian Army in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I.

===Ghadar Mutiny===
The Ghadar Mutiny was a plan to initiate a pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian Army in February 1915 to end the British Raj in India. The plot originated at the onset of World War I, between the Ghadar Party in the United States, the Berlin Committee in Germany, the Indian revolutionary underground in British India and the German Foreign Office through the consulate in San Francisco. The incident derives its name from the North American Ghadar Party, whose members of the Punjabi Sikh community in Canada and the United States were among the most prominent participants in the plan. It was the most prominent amongst a number of plans of the much larger Hindu–German Mutiny, formulated between 1914 and 1917 to initiate a Pan-Indian rebellion against the British Raj during World War I. The mutiny was planned to start in the key state of Punjab, followed by mutinies in Bengal and rest of India. Indian units as far as Singapore were planned to participate in the rebellion. The plans were thwarted through a coordinated intelligence and police response. British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadarite movement in Canada and in India, and last-minute intelligence from a spy helping to crush the planned uprising in Punjab before it started. Key figures were arrested, mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within India were also crushed.

Intelligence about the threat of the mutiny led to a number of important war-time measures introduced in India, including the passages of Ingress into India Ordinance, 1914, the Foreigners act 1914, and the Defence of India Act 1915. The conspiracy was followed by the First Lahore Conspiracy Trial and Benares Conspiracy Trial which saw death sentences awarded to a number of Indian revolutionaries, and exile to a number of others. After the end of the war, fear of a second Ghadarite uprising led to the recommendations of the Rowlatt Acts and thence the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

===1st Christmas Day and 2nd Christmas Day plot===

The first Christmas Day plot was a conspiracy made by the Indian revolutionary movement in 1909: during the year-ending holidays, the Governor of Bengal organised at his residence a ball in the presence of the Viceroy, the Commander-in-Chief and all the high-ranking officers and officials of the Capital (Calcutta). The 10th Jat Regiment was in charge of the security. Indoctrinated by Jatindranath Mukherjee, its soldiers decided to blow up the ballroom and take advantage of destroying the colonial Government. In keeping with his predecessor Otto (William Oskarovich) von Klemm, a friend of Lokamanya Tilak, on 6 February 1910, M. Arsenyev, the Russian Consul-General, wrote to St Petersburg that it had been intended to &quot;arouse in the country a general perturbation of minds and, thereby, afford the revolutionaries an opportunity to take the power in their hands.&quot; According to R. C. Majumdar, &quot;The police had suspected nothing and it is hard to say what the outcome would have been had the soldiers not been betrayed by one of their comrades who informed the authorities about the impending coup&quot;.

The second Christmas Day plot was to initiate an insurrection in Bengal in British India during World War I with German arms and support. Scheduled for Christmas Day, 1915, the plan was conceived and led by the Jugantar group under the Bengali Indian revolutionary Jatindranath Mukherjee, to be coordinated with simultaneous uprising in the British colony of Burma and Kingdom of Siam under direction of the Ghadar Party, along with a German raid on the South Indian city of Madras and the British penal colony in Andaman Islands. The aim of the plot was to seize the Fort William, isolate Bengal and capture the capital city of Calcutta, which was then to be used as a staging ground for a pan-Indian revolution. The Christmas Day plot was one of the later plans for pan-Indian mutiny during the war that were coordinated between the Indian nationalist underground, the &quot;Indian independence committee&quot; set up by the Germans in Berlin, the Ghadar Party in North America, and the German Foreign office. The plot was ultimately thwarted after British intelligence uncovered the plot through German and Indian double agents in Europe and Southeast Asia.

===Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition===
The Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition was a diplomatic mission to Afghanistan sent by the Central Powers in 1915–1916. The purpose was to encourage Afghanistan to declare full independence from the British Empire, enter World War I on the side of the Central Powers, and attack British India. The expedition was part of the Hindu–German Conspiracy, a series of Indo-German efforts to provoke a nationalist revolution in India. Nominally headed by the exiled Indian prince Raja Mahendra Pratap, the expedition was a joint operation of Germany and Turkey and was led by the German Army officers Oskar Niedermayer and Werner Otto von Hentig. Other participants included members of an Indian nationalist organisation called the Berlin Committee, including Maulavi Barkatullah and Chempakaraman Pillai, while the Turks were represented by Kazim Bey, a close confidante of Enver Pasha.

Britain saw the expedition as a serious threat. Britain and its ally, the Russian Empire, unsuccessfully attempted to intercept it in Persia during the summer of 1915. Britain waged a covert intelligence and diplomatic offensive, including personal interventions by the Viceroy Lord Hardinge and King George V, to maintain Afghan neutrality.

The mission failed in its main task of rallying Afghanistan, under Emir Habibullah Khan, to the German and Turkish war effort, but it influenced other major events. In Afghanistan, the expedition triggered reforms and drove political turmoil that culminated in the assassination of the Emir in 1919, which in turn precipitated the Third Afghan War. It influenced the Kalmyk Project of nascent Bolshevik Russia to propagate socialist revolution in Asia, with one goal being the overthrow of the British Raj. Other consequences included the formation of the Rowlatt Committee to investigate sedition in India as influenced by Germany and Bolshevism, and changes in the Raj&#x27;s approach to the Indian independence movement immediately after World War I.

===Nationalist response to war===
In the aftermath of the First World War, high casualty rates, soaring inflation compounded by heavy taxation, a widespread influenza pandemic and the disruption of trade during the war escalated human suffering in India.

The pre-war nationalist movement revived moderate and extremist groups within the Congress submerged their differences in order to stand together as a unified front. They argued that their enormous services to the British Empire during the war demanded a reward to demonstrate Indian capacity for self-rule. In 1916, Congress succeeded in forging the Lucknow Pact, a temporary alliance with the All India Muslim League over the issues of devolution and the future of Islam in the region.

===British reforms===
The British themselves adopted a &quot;carrot and stick&quot; approach in recognition of India&#x27;s support during the war and in response to renewed nationalist demands. In August 1917, Edwin Montagu, Secretary of state for India, made an historic announcement in Parliament that the British policy was for: &quot;increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire.&quot; The means of achieving the proposed measures were later enshrined in the Government of India Act, 1919, which introduced the principle of a dual-mode of administration, or diarchy, in which both elected Indian legislators and, appointed British officials shared power. The act also expanded the central and provincial legislatures and widened the franchise considerably. The diarchy set in motion certain real changes at the provincial level: a number of non-controversial or &quot;transferred&quot; portfolios, such as agriculture, local government, health, education, and public works, were handed over to Indians, while more sensitive matters such as finance, taxation, and maintaining law and order were retained by the provincial British administrators.

==Gandhi arrives in India==
Gandhi had been a leader of the Indian nationalist movement in South Africa. He had also been a vocal opponent of basic discrimination and abusive labour treatment as well as suppressive police control such as the Rowlatt Acts. During these protests, Gandhi had perfected the concept of &quot;satyagraha&quot;. In January 1914 (well before the First World War began) Gandhi was successful. The legislation against Indians was repealed and all Indian political prisoners were released by General Jan Smuts. Gandhi accomplished this through extensive use of non-violent protests, such as boycotting, protest marching, and fasting by him and his followers.

Gandhi returned to India on 9 January 1915, and initially entered the political fray not with calls for a nation-state, but in support of the unified commerce-oriented territory that the Congress Party had been asking for. Gandhi believed that the industrial development and educational development that the Europeans had brought were long required to alleviate many of India&#x27;s chronic problems. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a veteran Congressman and Indian leader, became Gandhi&#x27;s mentor. Gandhi&#x27;s ideas and strategies of non-violent civil disobedience initially appeared impractical to some Indians and their Congress leaders. In the Mahatma&#x27;s own words, &quot;civil disobedience is civil breach of immoral statutory enactments.&quot; It had to be carried out non-violently by withdrawing co-operation with the corrupt state. Gandhi had great respect for Lokmanya Tilak. His programmes were all inspired by Tilak&#x27;s &quot;Chatusutri&quot; programme.

The positive impact of reform was seriously undermined in 1919 by the Rowlatt Act, named after the recommendations made the previous year to the Imperial Legislative Council by the Rowlatt Committee. The commission was set up to look into the war-time conspiracies by the nationalist organisations and recommend measures to deal with the problem in the post-war period. Rowlatt recommended the extension of the war-time powers of the Defence of India act into the post-war period. The war-time act had vested the Viceroy&#x27;s government with extraordinary powers to quell sedition by silencing the press, detaining political activists without trial, and arresting any individuals suspected of sedition or treason without a warrant. It was increasingly reviled within India due to widespread and indiscriminate use. Many popular leaders, including Annie Besant and Ali brothers had been detained. The Rowlatt Act was, therefore, passed in the face of universal opposition among the (non-official) Indian members in the Viceroy&#x27;s council. The extension of the act drew widespread critical opposition. A nationwide cessation of work (&quot;hartal&quot;) was called, marking the beginning of widespread, although not nationwide, popular discontent.

The agitation unleashed by the acts led to demonstrations and British repressions, culminating on 13 April 1919, in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (also known as the Amritsar Massacre) in Amritsar, Punjab. In response to agitation in Amritsar, Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer blocked the main, and only entrance, and ordered troops under his command to fire into an unarmed and unsuspecting crowd of some 15,000 men, women, and children. They had assembled peacefully at Jallianwala Bagh, a walled courtyard, but Dyer had wanted to execute the imposed ban on all meetings and proposed to teach all protestors a lesson the harsher way. A total of 1,651 rounds were fired, killing 379 people (as according to an official British commission; Indian officials&#x27; estimates ranged as high as 1,499 and wounding 1,137 in the massacre.) Dyer was forced to retire but was hailed as a hero by some in Britain, demonstrating to Indian nationalists that the Empire was beholden to public opinion in Britain, but not in India. The episode dissolved wartime hopes of home rule and goodwill and opened a rift that could not be bridged short of complete self-rule.

===First non-cooperation movement===
From 1920 to 1922, Gandhi started the Non-Cooperation Movement. At the Kolkata session of the Congress in September 1920, Gandhi convinced other leaders of the need to start a non-co-operation movement in support of Khilafat as well as for dominion status. The first satyagraha movement urged the use of khadi and Indian material as alternatives to those shipped from Britain. It also urged people to boycott British educational institutions and law courts, resign from government employment, refuse to pay taxes, and forsake British titles and honors. Although this came too late to influence the framing of the new &quot;Government of India Act 1919&quot;, the movement enjoyed widespread popular support, and the resulting unparalleled magnitude of disorder presented a serious challenge to foreign rule. However, Gandhi called off the movement because he was scared after the Chauri Chaura incident, which saw the death of twenty-two policemen at the hands of an angry mob that India would descend into anarchy.

In 1920, under Gandhi&#x27;s leadership, the Congress was reorganized and given a new constitution, whose goal was &quot;swaraj&quot;. Membership in the party was opened to anyone prepared to pay a token fee, and a hierarchy of committees was established and made responsible for discipline and control over a hitherto amorphous and diffuse movement. The party was transformed from an elite organisation to one of mass national appeal.

Gandhi was sentenced in 1922 to six years in prison, but was released after serving two. On his release from prison, he set up the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad. On the banks of the river Sabarmati, he established the newspaper &quot;Young India&quot;, introducing a series of reforms aimed at the socially disadvantaged within Hindu society — the rural poor, and the untouchables. This era saw the emergence of a new generation of Indians from within the Congress Party, including Maulana Azad, C. Rajagopalachari, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose and others- who would, later on, come to form the most prominent voices of the Indian self-rule movement, whether keeping with Gandhian Values, or, as in the case of Bose&#x27;s Indian National Army, diverging from it.

The Indian political spectrum was further broadened in the mid-1920s by the emergence of both moderate and militant parties, such as the Swaraj Party, Hindu Mahasabha, Communist Party of India and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Regional political organisations also continued to represent the interests of non-Brahmins in Madras, Mahars in Maharashtra, and Sikhs in Punjab. However, people like Mahakavi Subramanya Bharathi, Vanchinathan, and Neelakanda Brahmachari played a major role from Tamil Nadu in both self-rule struggle and fighting for equality for all castes and communities. Many women participated in the movement, including Kasturba Gandhi (Gandhi&#x27;s wife), Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, Muthulaxmi Reddy, Aruna Asaf Ali, and many others.

===Result of movements by Gandhi===
The mass movements sparked nationalist sentiment with the Indian populace and figures like Mahatma Gandhi united a nation behind his non-violence movement; philosophy and undoubtedly put crucial pressure on the British occupation. The movements failed in their primary objective, achieving independence for India, as they were often called off before they naturally concluded due to laws and punishment. While in the later years of the Raj economic factors like the reversing trade fortunes between Britain and India and the cost of fielding the Indian armed forces abroad lumped on the British taxpayer by the 1935 Government of India act, had mounting implications for British administration, united resistance further drew light on the growing disparity of the British failures to achieve solidarity over India.

On 14 July 1942 the Congress Working Committee (executive committee of Indian National Congress), whose president Abul Kalam Azad supported Gandhi, passed a resolution demanding complete independence from the British government, and proposed massive civil disobedience if the British did not accede to the demands. On 8 August 1942 the Quit India Movement (Bharat Chhodo Andolan) began, a civil disobedience movement in India in response to Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s call for immediate self-rule by Indians and against sending Indians to World War II. Other major parties rejected the Quit India plan, and most cooperated closely with the British, as did the princely states, the civil service, and the police. The Muslim League supported the Raj and grew rapidly in membership, and in influence with the British.

The British swiftly responded to the Quit India Movement with mass arrests. Over 100,000 arrests were made, massive fines were levied, and demonstrators were subjected to public flogging. Hundreds of civilians were killed in violence many shot by the police army. Tens of thousands of leaders were also arrested and imprisoned until 1945. Ultimately, the British government realised that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the question for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully.

== Purna Swaraj ==
Congress leader and famous poet Hasrat Mohani and Communist Party of India leader Swami Kumaranand had demanded complete independence (Purna Swaraj) from the British in 1921 and put the resolution during an All-India Congress Forum at the Ahmedabad Session of AICC. Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi supported the &#x27;Purna Swaraj&#x27; motion demanded by Hasrat Mohani.

In 1928, India League was established by V. K. Krishna Menon in London to demand total independence from the British rule. This organisation has been described as &quot;the principal organisation promoting Indian nationalism in pre-war Britain&quot;.

Following the rejection of the Simon Commission&#x27;s rejections, an all-party conference was held at Mumbai in May 1928 to instill a sense of camaraderie. The conference appointed a committee under Motilal Nehru to create a constitution for India. The Kolkata session of the Indian National Congress asked the British government to accord India dominion status by December 1929, or face a countrywide civil disobedience movement.
Amid rising discontent and increasingly violent regional movements, a call for complete sovereignty and an end to British rule found greater support from the people. At the Lahore session in December 1929, the Indian National Congress adopted the aim of complete self-rule. It authorised the Working Committee to launch a civil disobedience movement throughout the country. It was decided that 26 January 1930 should be observed all over India as the &quot;Purna Swaraj&quot; (complete self-rule) Day.The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931, and the government agreed to release political prisoners. Mahatma Gandhi managed to have over 90,000 political prisoners released under this pact. Though his appeal to terminate the death sentences of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar and Shivaram Rajguru was not accepted by the British. For the next few years, Congress and the government negotiated until the Government of India Act 1935 emerged. The Muslim League disputed the claim of the Congress to represent all people of India, while the Congress disputed the Muslim League&#x27;s claim to voice the aspirations of all Muslims.

The Civil Disobedience Movement launched a new chapter in the Indian independence movement. It did not succeed by itself, but it brought the Indian population together, under the Indian National Congress&#x27;s leadership. The movement resulted in self rule being a talking point once again, and recruited more Indians to the idea. The movement allowed the Indian independence community to revive their inner confidence and strength against the British Government. In addition, the movement weakened the authority of the British and aided in the end of the British Empire in India. Overall, the civil disobedience Movement was an essential achievement in the history of Indian self-rule because it persuaded New Delhi of the role of the masses in self-determination.

==Elections and the Lahore resolution==
The Government of India Act 1935, the voluminous and final constitutional effort at governing British India, articulated three major goals: establishing a loose federal structure, achieving provincial autonomy, and safeguarding minority interests through separate electorates. The federal provisions, intended to unite princely states and British India at the centre, were not implemented because of ambiguities in safeguarding the existing privileges of princes. In February 1937, however, provincial autonomy became a reality when elections were held; the Congress emerged as the dominant party with a clear majority in five provinces and held an upper hand in two, while the Muslim League performed poorly.

In 1939, the Viceroy Linlithgow declared India&#x27;s entrance into the Second World War without consulting provincial governments. In protest, the Congress asked all of its elected representatives to resign from the government. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the president of the All-India Muslim League, persuaded participants at the annual Muslim League session at Lahore in 1940 to adopt what later came to be known as the Lahore Resolution, demanding the division of India into two separate sovereign states, one Muslim, the other Hindu; sometimes referred to as Two Nation Theory. Although the idea of Pakistan had been introduced as early as 1930, very few had responded to it.

In opposition to the Lahore Resolution, the All India Azad Muslim Conference gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for a united India. Its members included several Islamic organisations in India, as well as 1400 nationalist Muslim delegates; the &quot;attendance at the Nationalist meeting was about five times than the attendance at the League meeting.&quot;

The All-India Muslim League worked to try to silence those Muslims who stood against the partition of India, often using &quot;intimidation and coercion&quot;. The murder of the All India Azad Muslim Conference leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro also made it easier for the All-India Muslim League to demand the creation of Pakistan.

==Revolutionary movement==

There is no real connection between these two unrests, labour, and Congress opposition. But their very existence and coexistence, explains and fully justifies the attention, which Lord Irwin gave to the labour problems.
::- London Times, 29 January 1928

Apart from a few stray struggles, revolutions against the British rulers did not occur before the beginning of the 20th century. The Indian revolutionary underground began gathering momentum through the first decade of the 20th century, with groups arising in Bengal, Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and the Madras Presidency including what is now called South India. More groups were scattered around India. Particularly notable movements arose in Bengal, especially around the Partition of Bengal in 1905, and in Punjab after 1907. In the former case, it was the educated, intelligent and dedicated youth of the urban middle class &quot;Bhadralok&quot; community that came to form the &quot;classic&quot; Indian revolutionary, while the latter had an immense support base in the rural and military society of Punjab.

In Bengal, the emerged from conglomerations of local youth groups and gyms (&quot;Akhra&quot;) in Bengal in 1902, forming two prominent and somewhat independent arms in East and West Bengal identified as in Dhaka (modern-day Bangladesh), and the &quot;Jugantar&quot; group (centred at Calcutta) respectively. Led by nationalists of the likes of Aurobindo Ghosh and his brother Barindra Ghosh, the &quot;Samiti&quot; was influenced by philosophies as diverse as Hindu &quot;Shakta&quot; philosophy propounded by Bengali literature Bankim and Vivekananda, Italian Nationalism, and Pan-Asianism of Kakuzo Okakura. The &quot;Samiti&quot; was involved in a number of noted incidences of revolutionary terrorism against British interests and administration in India within the decade of its founding, including early attempts to assassinate Raj officials whilst led by Ghosh brothers. In the meantime, in Maharashtra and Punjab arose similarly militant nationalist feelings. The District Magistrate of Nasik, A.M.T. Jackson was shot dead by Anant Kanhere in December 1909, followed by the death of Robert D&#x27;Escourt Ashe at the hands of Vanchi Iyer.

Indian nationalism made headway through Indian societies as far as Paris and London. In London India House under the patronage of Shyamji Krishna Verma came under increasing scrutiny for championing and justifying violence in the cause of Indian nationalism, which found in Indian students in Britain and from Indian expatriates in Paris Indian Society avid followers. By 1907, through Indian nationalist Madame Bhikaji Rustom Cama&#x27;s links to Russian revolutionary Nicholas Safranski, Indian groups including Bengal revolutionaries as well as India House under V.D. Savarkar were able to obtain manuals for manufacturing bombs. India House was also a source of arms and seditious literature that was rapidly distributed in India. In addition to &quot;The Indian Sociologist&quot;, pamphlets like &quot;Bande Mataram&quot; and &quot;Oh Martyrs!&quot; by Savarkar extolled revolutionary violence. Direct influences and incitement from India House were noted in several incidents of political violence, including assassinations, in India at the time. One of the two charges against Savarkar during his trial in Bombay was for abetting the murder of the District Magistrate of Nasik, A.M.T. Jackson, by Anant Kanhere in December 1909. The arms used were directly traced through an Italian courier to India House. Ex-India House residents M.P.T. Acharya and V.V.S. Aiyar were noted in the Rowlatt report to have aided and influenced political assassinations, including the murder of Robert D&#x27;Escourt Ashe. The Paris-Safranski link was strongly suggested by French police to be involved in a 1907 attempt in Bengal to derail the train carrying the Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser.

The activities of nationalists abroad is believed to have shaken the loyalty of a number of native regiments of the British Indian Army. The assassination of William Hutt Curzon Wyllie in the hands of Madanlal Dhingra was highly publicised and saw increasing surveillance and suppression of Indian nationalism. These were followed by the 1912 attempt on the life of Viceroy of India. Following this, the nucleus of networks formed in India House, the Anushilan Samiti, nationalists in Punjab, and the nationalism that arose among Indian expatriates and labourers in North America, a different movement began to emerge in the North American Ghadar Party, culminating in the Sedetious conspiracy of World War I led by Rash Behari Bose and Lala Hardayal.
However, the emergence of the Gandhian movement slowly began to absorb the different revolutionary groups. The Bengal &quot;Samiti&quot; moved away from its philosophy of violence in the 1920s, when a number of its members identified closely with the Congress and Gandhian non-violent movement. Revolutionary nationalist violence saw a resurgence after the collapse of Gandhian non-cooperation movement in 1922. In Bengal, this saw reorganisation of groups linked to the &quot;Samiti&quot; under the leadership of Surya Sen and Hem Chandra Kanungo. A spate of violence led up to the enactment of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment in the early 1920s, which recalled the powers of incarceration and detention of the Defence of India Act. In north India, remnants of Punjab and Bengalee revolutionary organisations reorganised, notably under Sachindranath Sanyal, founding the Hindustan Republican Association with Chandrashekhar Azad in north India.

The HSRA had strong influences from leftist ideologies. Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) was formed under the leadership of Chandrasekhar Azad. Kakori train robbery was done largely by the members of HSRA. A number of Congress leaders from Bengal, especially Subhash Chandra Bose, were accused by the British Government of having links with and allowing patronage to the revolutionary organisations during this time. The violence and radical philosophy revived in the 1930s, when revolutionaries of the &quot;Samiti&quot; and the HSRA were involved in the Chittagong armoury raid and the Kakori conspiracy and other attempts against the administration in British India and Raj officials. Sachindra Nath Sanyal mentored revolutionaries in the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army (HSRA), including Bhagat Singh and Jatindra Nath Das, among others; including arms training and how to make bombs. Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly on 8 April 1929 protesting against the passage of the Public Safety Bill and the Trade Disputes Bill while raising slogans of &quot;Inquilab Zindabad&quot;, though no one was killed or injured in the bomb incident. Bhagat Singh surrendered after the bombing incident and a trial was conducted. Sukhdev and Rajguru were also arrested by police during search operations after the bombing incident. Following the trial (Central Assembly Bomb Case), Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged in 1931. Allama Mashriqi founded Khaksar Tehreek in order to direct particularly the Muslims towards the self-rule movement. Some of its members left for the Indian National Congress then led by Subhas Chandra Bose, while others identified more closely with Communism. The &quot;Jugantar&quot; branch formally dissolved in 1938. On 13 March 1940, Udham Singh shot Michael O&#x27;Dwyer (the last political murder outside India), generally held responsible for the Amritsar Massacre, in London. However, the revolutionary movement gradually disseminated into the Gandhian movement. As the political scenario changed in the late 1930s — with the mainstream leaders considering several options offered by the British and with religious politics coming into play — revolutionary activities gradually declined. Many past revolutionaries joined mainstream politics by joining Congress and other parties, especially communist ones, while many of the activists were kept under hold in different jails across the country. Indians who were based in the UK, joined the India League and the Indian Workers Association, partaking in revolutionary activities in Britain.

Within a short time of its inception, these organisations became the focus of an extensive police and intelligence operations. Operations against saw founding of the Special Branch of Calcutta Police. The intelligence operations against India House saw the founding of the Indian Political Intelligence Office which later grew to be the Intelligence Bureau in independent India. Heading the intelligence and missions against Ghadarite movement and India revolutionaries was the MI5(g) section, and at one point involved the Pinkerton&#x27;s detective agency. Notable officers who led the police and intelligence operations against Indian revolutionaries, or were involved in it, at various time included John Arnold Wallinger, Sir Robert Nathan, Sir Harold Stuart, Vernon Kell, Sir Charles Stevenson-Moore and Sir Charles Tegart, as well as W. Somerset Maugham. The threat posed by the activities of the &quot;Samiti&quot; in Bengal during World War I, along with the threat of a Ghadarite uprising in Punjab, saw the passage of Defence of India Act 1915. These measures saw the arrest, internment, transportations, and execution of a number of revolutionaries linked to the organisation, and was successful in crushing the East Bengal Branch. In the aftermath of the war, the Rowlatt committee recommended extending the Defence of India Act (as the Rowlatt act) to thwart any possible revival of the &quot;Samiti&quot; in Bengal and the Ghadarite movement in Punjab.

In the 1920s, Alluri Sitarama Raju led the ill-fated Rampa Rebellion of 1922–24, during which a band of tribal leaders and other sympathisers fought against the British Raj. Local people referred to him as &quot;Manyam Veerudu&quot; (&quot;Hero of the Jungles&quot;). After the passage of the 1882 Madras Forest Act, its restrictions on the free movement of tribal peoples in the forest prevented them from engaging in their traditional &quot;podu&quot; (Slash-and-burn) agricultural system, which involved shifting cultivation. Raju started a protest movement in the border areas of the Godavari Agency part of Madras Presidency (present-day Andhra Pradesh). Inspired by the patriotic zeal of revolutionaries in Bengal, Raju raided police stations in and around Chintapalle, Rampachodavaram, Dammanapalli, Krishna Devi Peta, Rajavommangi, Addateegala, Narsipatnam and Annavaram. Raju and his followers stole guns and ammunition and killed several British Indian Army officers, including Scott Coward near Dammanapalli. The British campaign lasted for nearly a year from December 1922. Raju was eventually trapped by the British in the forests of Chintapalli then tied to a tree and shot dead with a rifle.

The Kallara-Pangode Struggle was one of some 39 agitations against the Government of India. The Home department has later notified about 38 movements/struggles across Indian territories as the ones that culminated in self-rule ended the British Raj.

Vanchinathan, in a letter found in his pocket, stated the following:
==Final process of Indian self-rule movement==
In 1937, provincial elections were held and the Congress came to power in seven of the eleven provinces. This was a strong indicator of the Indian people&#x27;s support for complete self-rule.

When the Second World War started, Viceroy Linlithgow unilaterally declared India a belligerent state on the side of Britain, without consulting the elected Indian representatives. In opposition to Linlithgow&#x27;s action, the entire Congress leadership resigned from the provincial and local governments. The Muslims and Sikhs, by contrast, strongly supported the war effort and gained enormous stature in London. Defying Congress, millions of Indians supported the war effort, and indeed the British Indian Army became the largest volunteer force, numbering 2,500,000 men during the war.

Especially during the Battle of Britain in 1940, Gandhi resisted calls for massive civil disobedience movements that came from within as well as outside his party, stating he did not seek India&#x27;s self-rule out of the ashes of a destroyed Britain. In 1942, the Congress launched the Quit India movement. There was some violence but the Raj cracked down and arrested tens of thousands of Congress leaders, including all the main national and provincial figures. They were not released until the end of the war was in sight in 1945.

The self-rule movement included the Kakori conspiracy (9 August 1925) led by Indian youth under the leadership of Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil and masterminded by Rajendra Lahiri; and the Azad Hind movement, whose main protagonist Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was a former leader of Congress. From its earliest wartime inception, Bose joined the Axis Powers to fight Britain.

===Quit India Movement===
The Quit India Movement (also known as &quot;Bharat Chhodo Andolan&quot;) was a civil disobedience movement in India which commenced on 8 August 1942 in response to Gandhi&#x27;s call for immediate self-rule by Indians and against sending Indians to World War II. He asked all teachers to leave their schools, and other Indians to leave their respective jobs and take part in this movement. Due to Gandhi&#x27;s political influence, his request was followed by a significant proportion of the population. In addition, Congress-led the Quit India Movement to demand the British to leave India and transfer the political power to a representative government.

During the movement, Gandhi and his followers continued to use non-violence against British rule. This movement was where Gandhi gave his famous message, &quot;Do or Die!&quot;, and this message spread towards the Indian community. In addition, this movement was addressed directly to women as &quot;disciplined soldiers of Indian freedom&quot; and they had to keep the war for independence to go on (against British rule).
At the outbreak of war, the Congress Party had during the Wardha meeting of the working-committee in September 1939, passed a resolution conditionally supporting the fight against fascism, but were rebuffed when they asked for self-rule in return. In March 1942, faced with an increasingly dissatisfied sub-continent only reluctantly participating in the war, and deteriorations in the war situation in Europe and South East Asia, and with growing dissatisfactions among Indian troops- especially in Europe- and among the civilian population in the sub-continent, the British government sent a delegation to India under Stafford Cripps, in what came to be known as the Cripps&#x27; Mission. The purpose of the mission was to negotiate with the Indian National Congress a deal to obtain total co-operation during the war, in return of progressive devolution and distribution of power from the crown and the Viceroy to elected Indian legislature. However, the talks failed, having failed to address the key demand of a timeframe towards self-government, and of the definition of the powers to be relinquished, essentially portraying an offer of limited dominion-status that was wholly unacceptable to the Indian movement. To force the British Raj to meet its demands and to obtain definitive word on total self-rule, the Congress took the decision to launch the Quit India Movement.

The aim of the movement was to force the British Government to the negotiating table by holding the Allied war effort hostage. The call for determined but passive resistance that signified the certitude that Gandhi foresaw for the movement is best described by his call to &quot;Do or Die&quot;, issued on 8 August at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Bombay, since renamed &quot;August Kranti Maidan&quot; (August Revolution Ground). However, almost the entire Congress leadership, and not merely at the national level, was put into confinement less than 24 hours after Gandhi&#x27;s speech, and the greater number of the Congress were to spend the rest of the war in jail.

On 8 August 1942, the Quit India resolution was passed at the Mumbai session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC). The draft proposed that if the British did not accede to the demands, a massive Civil Disobedience would be launched. However, it was an extremely controversial decision. At Gowalia Tank, Mumbai, Gandhi urged Indians to follow non-violent civil disobedience. Gandhi told the masses to act as citizens of a sovereign nation and not to follow the orders of the British. The British, already alarmed by the advance of the Japanese army to the India–Burma border, responded the next day by imprisoning Gandhi at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. The Congress Party&#x27;s Working Committee, or national leadership was arrested all together and imprisoned at the Ahmednagar Fort. They also banned the party altogether. All the major leaders of the INC were arrested and detained. As the masses were leaderless the protest took a violent turn. Large-scale protests and demonstrations were held all over the country. Workers remained absent en masse and strikes were called. The movement also saw widespread acts of sabotage, Indian under-ground organisation carried out bomb attacks on allied supply convoys, government buildings were set on fire, electricity lines were disconnected and transport and communication lines were severed. The disruptions were under control in a few weeks and had little impact on the war effort. The movement soon became a leaderless act of defiance, with a number of acts that deviated from Gandhi&#x27;s principle of non-violence. In large parts of the country, the local underground organisations took over the movement.

All the other major parties rejected the Quit India plan, and most cooperated closely with the British, as did the princely states, the civil service, and the police. The Muslim League supported the Raj and grew rapidly in membership, and in influence with the British.

There was opposition to the Quit India Movement from several political quarters who were fighting for Indian self-rule. Hindu nationalist parties like the Hindu Mahasabha openly opposed the call and boycotted the Quit India Movement. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the president of the Hindu Mahasabha at that time, even went to the extent of writing a letter titled &quot;Stick to your Posts&quot;, in which he instructed Hindu Sabhaites who happened to be &quot;members of municipalities, local bodies, legislatures or those serving in the army...to stick to their posts&quot; across the country, and not to join the Quit India Movement at any cost.

The other Hindu nationalist organisation, and Mahasabha affiliate Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) had a tradition of keeping aloof from the anti-British Indian self-rule movement since its founding by K.B. Hedgewar in 1925. In 1942, the RSS, under M.S. Golwalkar completely abstained from joining in the Quit India Movement as well. The Bombay government (British) appreciated the RSS as such, by noting that,
 The Sangh has scrupulously kept itself within the law, and in particular, has refrained from taking part in the disturbances that broke out in August 1942.
The British Government stated that the RSS was not at all supporting any civil disobedience against them, and as such their other political activities(even if objectionable) can be overlooked. Further, the British Government also asserted that at Sangh meetings organised during the times of anti-British movements started and fought by the Indian National Congress,
 Speakers urged the Sangh members to keep aloof from the congress movement and these instructions were generally observed.
 As such, the British government did not crackdown on the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha at all.

The RSS head (&quot;sarsanghchalak&quot;) during that time, M.S. Golwalkar later openly admitted to the fact that the RSS did not participate in the Quit India Movement. However, such an attitude during the Indian independence movement also led to the Sangh being viewed with distrust and anger, both by the general Indian public, as well as certain members of the organisation itself. In Golwalkar&#x27;s own words,
In 1942 also, there was a strong sentiment in the hearts of many. At that time too, the routine work of the Sangh continued. Sangh decided not to do anything directly. &#x27;Sangh is the organisation of inactive people, their talks have no substance&#x27; was the opinion uttered not only by outsiders but also our own &quot;swayamsevaks&quot;.
A number of violent incidents against British officials also took place during the Quit India movement around the country. The British arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945. Ultimately, the British government realised that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the question for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully.

===Others===


India&#x27;s entry into the world war was strongly opposed by Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose had been elected President of the Congress in 1938 and 1939 but later resigned owing to differences of opinion with the Congress, however he remained emotionally attached to Congress for the remainder of his life. After his resignation he formed his own wing separated from the mainstream Congress leadership known as Forward bloc which was a &quot;loci&quot; focus for ex-congress leaders holding socialist views. Bose then founded the All India Forward Bloc. In 1940 the British authorities in Calcutta placed Bose under house arrest. However, he escaped and made his way through Afghanistan to Nazi Germany to seek Hitler and Mussolini&#x27;s help for raising an army to fight the British. The Free India Legion comprising Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Indian POWs was formed. After a dramatic decline in Germany&#x27;s military fortunes, a German land invasion of India became untenable. Hitler advised Bose to go to Japan where a submarine was arranged to transport Bose, who was ferried to Japanese Southeast Asia, where he formed the Azad Hind Government. The Provisional Free Indian Government in exile reorganised the Japanese collaborationit unit Indian National Army composed of Indian POWs and volunteer Indian expatriates in South-East Asia, with the help of the Japanese. Its aim was to reach India as a fighting force that would build on public resentment to inspire revolt among Indian soldiers of the Raj.

The INA was to see action against the Allies, including the British Indian Army, in the forests of Arakan, Burma, and in Assam, laying siege to Imphal and Kohima with the Japanese 15th Army. During the war, the Andaman and Nicobar islands were captured by the Japanese and handed over by them to the INA.

While a number of Japanese officers, even those like Fujiwara, who were devoted to the Indian cause, observed Bose as a military incompetent as well as an unrealistic and stubborn man who sees only his own needs and problems and could not observe the larger picture of the war as the Japanese had to.

The INA failed owing to disrupted logistics, poor supplies from the Japanese, and lack of training. The Azad Hind Fauj surrendered unconditionally to the British in Singapore in 1945. Subhas Chandra Bose&#x27;s death occurred from third-degree burns on 18 August 1945 after his overloaded Japanese plane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan).

Trials against members of the INA began in late 1945, and included the infamous joint court-martial of key figures Shah Nawaz Khan and Prem Sahgal. A number of Congress members including Tej Bahadur Sapru, Aruna Asaf Ali and Jawaharlal Nehru played a significant role in getting INA members released.
The Royal Indian Navy Mutiny was a failed insurrection which encompassed a total strike and subsequent mutiny by Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Navy on board ship and shore establishments at Bombay (Mumbai) harbour on 18 February 1946. From the initial flashpoint in Bombay, the mutiny spread and found support throughout British India, from Karachi to Calcutta and ultimately came to involve 78 ships, 20 shore establishments and 10,000 sailors.

The agitations, mass strikes, demonstrations and consequently support for the mutineers, therefore continued several days even after the mutiny had been called off. Along with this, the assessment may be made that it described in crystal clear terms to the government that the British Indian Armed forces could no longer be universally relied upon for support in crisis, and even more it was more likely itself to be the source of the sparks that would ignite trouble in a country fast slipping out of the scenario of political settlement.

The mutiny ended with the surrender of revolting the sailors to British officials. Congress and the Muslim League had convinced Indian sailors to surrender. They condemned the mutiny due to the political and military risks of unrest.

==Sovereignty and partition of India==
On 3 June 1947, Viscount Louis Mountbatten, the last British Governor-General of India, announced the partitioning of British India into India and Pakistan. With the speedy passage of the Indian Independence Act 1947, at 11:57 on 14 August 1947 Pakistan was declared a separate nation. Then at 12:02 A.M., on 15 August 1947 India became a sovereign and democratic nation. Eventually, 15 August became Independence Day for India marking the end of British India. Also on 15 August, both Pakistan and India had the right to remain in or remove themselves from the British Commonwealth.

Violent clashes between Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims followed. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and deputy prime minister Vallabhbhai Patel had invited Mountbatten to continue as Governor General of India during the period of transition. He was replaced in June 1948 by Rajagopalachari. In May 1947, Nehru declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. Patel took on the responsibility for bringing princely states into the Union of India, steering efforts by his &quot;iron fist in a velvet glove&quot; policies. India used military force to integrate Junagadh, Hyderabad State (Operation Polo) and Kashmir (Instrument of Accession) to India.The Constituent Assembly, headed by the prominent lawyer, reformer and Dalit leader, B.R. Ambedkar was tasked heading the creation of the constitution of independent India. The Constituent Assembly completed the work of drafting the constitution on 26 November 1949; on 26 January 1950, the Republic of India was officially proclaimed. The Constituent Assembly elected Rajendra Prasad was the first President of India, taking over from Governor General Rajgopalachari. Subsequently, the French ceded Chandernagore in 1951, and Pondichéry and its remaining Indian colonies by 1954. Indian troops annexed Goa and Portugal&#x27;s other Indian enclaves in 1961, and Sikkim voted to join the Indian Union in 1975 after the Indian victory over China in Nathu La and Cho La.

Following self-rule in 1947, India remained in the Commonwealth of Nations, and relations between the UK and India have since become friendly. There are many areas in which the two countries seek stronger ties for mutual benefit, and the two nations also have strong cultural and social ties. The UK has an ethnic Indian population of over 1.6 million. In 2010, Prime Minister David Cameron described Indian – British relations as a &quot;New Special Relationship&quot;.

<doc id="161029" wikidata="Q954383" url="?curid=161029" title="Cecil Day-Lewis">
<text>Cecil Day-Lewis (or Day Lewis; 27 April 1904 – 22 May 1972), often written as C. Day-Lewis, was an Anglo-Irish poet and Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom from 1968 until his death in 1972. He also wrote mystery stories under the pseudonym of Nicholas Blake, most of which feature the fictional detective Nigel Strangeways.

During World War II, Day-Lewis worked as a publications editor in the Ministry of Information for the U.K. government, and also served in the Musbury branch of the British Home Guard. He was the father of actor Daniel Day-Lewis, and documentary filmmaker and television chef Tamasin Day-Lewis.

==Life and work==
Day-Lewis was born in 1904 in Ballintubbert, Athy/Stradbally border, Queen&#x27;s County (now known as County Laois), Ireland. He was the son of Frank Day-Lewis, a Church of Ireland rector of that parish, and Kathleen Blake (née Squires; died 1906). Some of his family were from England and the family had originally been from Berkhamsted, in Hertfordshire, and settled in Ireland in the late 1860s. His father took the surname &quot;Day-Lewis&quot; as a combination of his own birth father&#x27;s (&quot;Day&quot;) and adoptive father&#x27;s (&quot;Lewis&quot;) surnames. 
In his autobiography &quot;The Buried Day&quot; (1960), Day-Lewis wrote: &quot;As a writer I do not use the hyphen in my surname – a piece of inverted snobbery which has produced rather mixed results.&quot;

After the death of his mother in 1906, when he was two years old, Cecil was brought up in London by his father, with the help of an aunt, spending summer holidays with relatives in County Wexford. He was educated at Sherborne School and at Wadham College, Oxford. In Oxford, Day-Lewis became part of the circle gathered around W. H. Auden and helped him to edit &quot;Oxford Poetry 1927&quot;. His first collection of poems, &quot;Beechen Vigil&quot;, appeared in 1925.

In 1928, Day-Lewis married Constance Mary King, the daughter of a Sherborne teacher. Day-Lewis worked as a schoolmaster in three schools, including Larchfield School, Helensburgh, Scotland (now Lomond School). During the 1940s, he had a long and troubled love affair with the novelist Rosamond Lehmann, to whom he dedicated his 1943 poetry collection &quot;Word Over All&quot;. In 1948, Day-Lewis met actress Jill Balcon, daughter of Michael Balcon, at the recording of a radio programme and began an affair with her that year. He conducted simultaneous relationships with his wife Constance Mary, who lived with their two sons in Dorset, with Lehmann, who lived in Oxfordshire, and with Balcon. Finally he broke with his wife and Lehmann, and after his marriage was dissolved in 1951, he married Balcon, but he was no more faithful to her than he had been to his wife or Lehmann. Jill&#x27;s father was deeply unhappy about the scandalous affair since she was named publicly as co-respondent in Day-Lewis&#x27; divorce. He disinherited her and cut off all relationships with her and Day-Lewis.

During the Second World War, Day-Lewis worked as a publications editor in the Ministry of Information, an institution satirised by George Orwell in his dystopian &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, but equally based on Orwell&#x27;s experience of the BBC. During the Second World War, his work was less influenced by Auden and he was developing a more traditional style of lyricism. Some critics believe that he reached his full stature as a poet in &quot;Word Over All&quot; (1943), when he finally distanced himself from Auden. After the war, he joined the publisher Chatto &amp; Windus as a director and senior editor.

In 1946, Day-Lewis was a lecturer at Cambridge University, publishing his lectures in &quot;The Poetic Image&quot; (1947). Day-Lewis became a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the 1950 Birthday Honours. He later taught poetry at Oxford, where he was Professor of Poetry from 1951 to 1956. During 1962–1963, he was the Norton Professor at Harvard University. Day-Lewis was appointed Poet Laureate in 1968, in succession to John Masefield. His appointment came after appointments secretary John Hewitt consulted with Dame Helen Gardner, the Merton Professor of English at the University of Oxford (who stated that Day-Lewis &quot;produced run of the mill poetry but nothing particularly outstanding&quot;) and Geoffrey Handley-Taylor, chair of the Poetry Society (who stated that Day-Lewis was &quot;a good administrative poet&quot; and &quot;a safe bet&quot;).

Day-Lewis was chairman of the Arts Council Literature Panel, vice-president of the Royal Society of Literature, an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Member of the Irish Academy of Letters and a Professor of Rhetoric at Gresham College, London.

Cecil Day-Lewis died from pancreatic cancer on 22 May 1972, aged 68, at Lemmons, the Hertfordshire home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard, where he and his family were staying. As a great admirer of Thomas Hardy, he arranged to be buried near the author&#x27;s grave at St Michael&#x27;s Church in Stinsford, Dorset.

Day-Lewis was the father of four children. His first two children, with Constance Mary King, were Sean Day-Lewis (3 August 1931–9 June 2022), a TV critic and writer, and Nicholas Day-Lewis, who became an engineer. His children with Balcon were Tamasin Day-Lewis, a television chef and food critic, and Daniel Day-Lewis, who became an award-winning actor. Sean Day-Lewis wrote a biography of his father, &quot;C. Day-Lewis: An English Literary Life&quot; (1980).

Daniel Day-Lewis donated his father&#x27;s archive of poetry to the Bodleian Library.

==Nicholas Blake==
In 1935, Day-Lewis decided to increase his income from poetry by writing a detective novel, &quot;A Question of Proof&quot; under the pseudonym Nicholas Blake. He created Nigel Strangeways, an amateur investigator and gentleman detective who, as the nephew of an Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard, has access to official crime investigations. He published nineteen further crime novels. (In the first Nigel Strangeways novel, the detective is modelled on W. H. Auden, but Day-Lewis developed the character as a far less extravagant and more serious figure in later novels.) From the mid-1930s, Day-Lewis was able to earn his living by writing. Four of the Blake novels – &quot;A Tangled Web&quot;, &quot;A Penknife in My Heart&quot;, &quot;The Deadly Joker&quot;, &quot;The Private Wound&quot; – do not feature Strangeways.

&quot;Minute for Murder&quot; is set against the background of Day-Lewis&#x27;s Second World War experiences in the Ministry of Information. &quot;Head of a Traveller&quot; features as a principal character a well-known poet, frustrated and suffering writer&#x27;s block, whose best poetic days are long behind him. Readers and critics have speculated whether the author is describing himself or one of his colleagues or has entirely invented the character.

==Political views==
In his youth and during the disruption and suffering of the Great Depression, Day-Lewis adopted communist views, becoming a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain from 1935 to 1938. His early poetry was marked by didacticism and a preoccupation with social themes. In 1937, he edited &quot;The Mind in Chains: Socialism and the Cultural Revolution&quot;. In the introduction, he supported a popular front against a &quot;Capitalism that has no further use for culture&quot;. He explains that the title refers to Prometheus bound by his chains, quotes Shelley&#x27;s preface to &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; and says the contributors believe that &quot;the Promethean fire of enlightenment, which should be given for the benefit of mankind at large, is being used at present to stoke up the furnaces of private profit&quot;. The contributors were: Rex Warner, Edward Upward, Arthur Calder-Marshall, Barbara Nixon, Anthony Blunt, Alan Bush, Charles Madge, Alistair Brown, J.D. Bernal, T.A. Jackson and Edgell Rickword.

After the late 1930s, which were marked by the widespread purges, repression, and executions under Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union, Day-Lewis gradually became disillusioned with communism. In his autobiography, &quot;The Buried Day&quot; (1960), he renounces former communist views. His detective novel, &quot;The Sad Variety&quot; (1964), contains a scathing portrayal of doctrinaire communists, the Soviet Union&#x27;s repression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, and the ruthless tactics of Soviet intelligence agents.

<text>Barbara Mary Levick (21 June 1931 – 6 December 2023) was a British historian and epigrapher, focusing particularly on the Late Roman Republic and Early Empire. She was recognised within her field as one of the leading Roman historians of her generation.

== Early life and education ==
Barbara Mary Levick was born in London on 21 June 1931, the daughter of Frank Thomas and Mary (née Smart) Levick. She was educated at Brighton and Hove High School and St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. Her DPhil, on the subject of Roman colonies in South Asia Minor was undertaken in the mid-1950s and supervised by Ronald Syme. For this research she made two solo trips to Turkey, placing herself in a tradition at this time of largely Scottish and male epigraphers travelling in Anatolia. She focused, however, on Pisidia, a region that lay away from the routes explored by a group of her male contemporaries, although she was the only one to publish a book as a result of research from these expeditions.

== Career ==
In 1959, Levick was appointed a university fellow and tutor for Roman History at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, and in 1967 published her first monograph, drawing on material from her doctoral thesis, which forty years after its publication was described as a &quot;resilient classic of Roman history&quot;. The importance of this work came from both its focus on the Roman impact on Asia Minor, and the drawing together of both epigraphic and numismatic evidence. In this work she used the discoveries she made at Yalvaç in Turkey, and considered again material that had been neglected since the 1920s.

Levick was an influential editor of inscriptions who shaped the format of the &quot;Monumenta Asiae Minoris Antiqua&quot; series, directing two volumes of its publication. Her biographies of Roman emperors and Imperial women are widely known and receive largely positive reviews from their critics.

Her portrait was painted for St Hilda&#x27;s College by Jane Cursham.

== Death ==
Levick died on 6 December 2023, at the age of 92.

== Selected publications ==
A fuller bibliography of her works up to 2007 can be found in the Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies. Supplement, No. 100, VITA VIGILIA EST: ESSAYS IN HONOUR OF BARBARA LEVICK (2007).

<doc id="161033" wikidata="Q1155516" url="?curid=161033" title="Politics of Timor-Leste">
<text>The political system in Timor-Leste is a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste is the head of government and the President of Timor-Leste functions as head of state. Timor-Leste has a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the president and the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Parliament. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
The East Timorese constitution was modelled on that of Portugal, with lesser power given to the president. The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions. 

==Executive branch==

The head of state of the East Timorese republic is the President, who is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, and whose executive powers are somewhat limited by the constitution, the president is able to veto legislation, however this action can be overridden by the parliament. Following elections, the president usually appoints the leader of the majority party or majority coalition as the prime minister. As head of government the prime minister presides over the cabinet.
|President
|José Ramos-Horta
|CNRT
|20 May 2022
|Prime Minister
|Xanana Gusmão
|CNRT
|1 July 2023


==Legislative branch==
The unicameral Timorese National Parliament (&quot;Parlamento Nacional&quot;) has 65 members elected by proportional representation (d&#x27;Hondt method) for a five-year term. The number of seats can vary from a minimum of 52 to a maximum of 65, with the exception of the first parliament, which included 88 members who previously served as the Constitutional Assembly six years rather than five (2001-2007). The longer term was in part due to the constitustion being put in place in 2002.

The East Timorese constitution was modelled after that of Portugal. The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions.

==Political parties and elections==
===Presidential elections===

===Parliamentary elections===

== Recent developments ==

Francisco Guterres, known as Lú-Olo, of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) was elected president in 2017 and held the position until May 2022. The Alliance for Change and Progress (AMP), a three-party alliance, attempted to form a coalition with National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction, led by former president Xanana Gusmao, but the talks failed and Fretilin formed a minority government with the Timorese Democratic Party (DP) in September 2017. In October that year, the three opposition parties formed an alliance called Parliamentary Majority Oppositional Alliance (AOMP), and following pressures from this opposition alliance, president Guterres decided to dissolve the parliament in January 2018. This led to the second general election in May 2018. In June 2018, former president Jose Maria de Vasconcelos known as Taur Matan Ruak of the Alliance of Change for Progress (AMP), became the new prime minister. José Ramos-Horta of the centre-left CNRT has served as the president of Timor-Leste since 20 May 2022 after winning the April 2022 presidential election runoff.

In parliamentary elections held on Sunday, May 21, 2023, the opposition party led by Xanana Gusmao won 41% of the vote, making him likely to return as prime minister of the country in a coalition with at least one other party.

==Judicial branch==
The Supreme Court of Justice has one judge appointed by the National Parliament and the rest appointed by the Superior Council for the Judiciary. As mentioned in a 2010 source, the country was in the process of developing a legal system that includes private practice attorneys.

==Administrative divisions==
Timor-Leste is divided into fourteen municipalities:
The districts are subdivided into 65 subdistricts, 443 sucos and 2,336 towns, villages and hamlets. 

==Cabinet==

<doc id="161034" wikidata="Q1197667" url="?curid=161034" title="Vachel Lindsay">
<text>Nicholas Vachel Lindsay (; November 10, 1879 – December 5, 1931) was an American poet. He is considered a founder of modern &quot;singing poetry,&quot; as he referred to it, in which verses are meant to be sung or chanted.

==Early years==
Lindsay was born in Springfield, Illinois where his father, Vachel Thomas Lindsay, worked as a medical doctor and had amassed considerable wealth. The Lindsays lived across the street from the Illinois Executive Mansion, home of the Governor of Illinois. The location of his childhood home influenced Lindsay, and one of his poems, &quot;&quot;, eulogizes Illinois governor John P. Altgeld, whom Lindsay admired for his courage in pardoning the anarchists involved in the Haymarket Affair, despite the strong protests of US President Grover Cleveland.

Growing up in Springfield influenced Lindsay in other ways, as evidenced in such poems as &quot;On the Building of Springfield&quot; and culminating in poems praising Springfield&#x27;s most famous resident, Abraham Lincoln. In &quot;&quot;, Lindsay exclaims, &quot;Would I might rouse the Lincoln in you all!&quot; This line was later adopted as the official motto of the Association of Lincoln Presenters. In his 1914 poem &quot;Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight (In Springfield, Illinois)&quot;, Lindsay specifically places Lincoln &quot;in&quot; Springfield, with the poem&#x27;s opening:

:It is portentous, and a thing of state
:That here at midnight, in our little town
:A mourning figure walks, and will not rest...

Lindsay studied medicine at Ohio&#x27;s Hiram College from 1897 to 1900, but he did not want to be a doctor; his parents were pressuring him toward medicine. Once he wrote to them that he wasn&#x27;t meant to be a doctor but a painter; they wrote back saying that doctors can draw pictures in their free time. He left Hiram anyway, heading to Chicago to study at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1900 to 1903. In 1904 he left to attend the New York School of Art (now The New School) to study pen and ink. Lindsay remained interested in art for the rest of his life, drawing illustrations for some of his poetry. His art studies also probably led him to appreciate the new art form of silent film. His 1915 book &quot;The Art of the Moving Picture&quot; is generally considered the first book of film criticism, according to critic Stanley Kauffmann, discussing Lindsay in &quot;For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism&quot;.

==Beginnings as a poet==
While in New York in 1905 Lindsay turned to poetry in earnest. He tried to sell his poems on the streets. Self-printing his poems, he began to barter a pamphlet titled &quot;Rhymes To Be Traded For Bread&quot;, which he traded for food as a self-perceived modern version of a medieval troubadour.

From March to May, 1906, Lindsay traveled roughly 600 miles on foot from Jacksonville, Florida, to Kentucky, again trading his poetry for food and lodging. From April to May, 1908, Lindsay undertook another poetry-selling trek, walking from New York City to Hiram, Ohio.

From May to September 1912 he traveled—again on foot—from Illinois to New Mexico, trading his poems for food and lodging. During this last trek, Lindsay composed his most famous poem, &quot;The Congo&quot;. Going through Kansas, he was supposedly so successful that &quot;he had to send money home to keep his pockets empty&quot;. On his return, Harriet Monroe published in &quot;Poetry magazine&quot; first his poem &quot;General William Booth Enters into Heaven&quot; in 1913 and then &quot;The Congo&quot; in 1914. At this point, Lindsay became very well known.

==Poetry as performance==
Unlike Lindsay&#x27;s more purely intellectual contemporaries, the poet declaimed his works from the stage, complete with the extravagant gestures of a carnival barker and old time preacher, from the beginning declaring himself to be a product of what he termed &#x27;Higher Vaudeville&#x27;:
&quot;I think that my first poetic impulse is for music; second a definite conception with the ring of the universe...&quot; (Vachel Lindsay, Edgar Lee Masters 1935, page 62) This is evidenced by the 1931 recording he made just before his suicide, his still-radical performances of &#x27;The Mysterious Cat&#x27;, &#x27;The Flower-Fed Buffaloes&#x27; and parts of &#x27;The Congo&#x27; exhibiting a fiery and furious, zany, at times incoherent delivery that appears to have owed more to jazz than poetry, though the highly religious Lindsay was always reluctant to align himself thus.

Part of the success and great fame that Lindsay achieved—albeit briefly—was due to the singular manner in which he presented his poetry &quot;fundamentally as a performance, as an aural and temporal experience...meant...to be chanted, whispered, belted out, sung, amplified by gesticulation and movement, and punctuated by shouts and whoops.&quot; [2]

His best-known poem, &quot;The Congo,&quot; exemplified his revolutionary aesthetic of sound for sound&#x27;s sake. It imitates the pounding of the drums in the rhythms and in onomatopoeic nonsense words. At parts, the poem ceases to use conventional words when representing the chants of Congo&#x27;s indigenous people, relying just on sound alone.

Lindsay&#x27;s extensive correspondence with the poet W. B. Yeats details his intentions of reviving the musical qualities of poetry as they were practiced by the ancient Greeks. Because of his identity as a performance artist and his use of American midwestern themes, Lindsay became known in the 1910s as the &quot;Prairie Troubador.&quot;

In the final twenty years of his life, Lindsay was one of the best known poets in the U.S. His reputation enabled him to befriend, encourage and mentor other poets, such as Langston Hughes and Sara Teasdale. His poetry, though, lacked elements which encouraged the attention of academic scholarship, and, after his death, he became an obscure figure.

==Attitudes towards race==

Most contemporaries acknowledged Lindsay&#x27;s intention to be an advocate for African-Americans. This intention was particularly evident in the 1918 poem &quot;The Jazz Birds&quot;, praising the war efforts of African-Americans during World War I, an issue to which the vast majority of the white US seemed blind. Additionally, W.E.B. Du Bois hailed Lindsay&#x27;s story &quot;The Golden-Faced People&quot; for its insights into racism. Lindsay saw himself as anti-racist not only in his own writing but in his encouragement of a writer he credited himself with discovering: Langston Hughes, who, while working as a busboy at a Washington, D.C. restaurant where Lindsay ate, gave Lindsay copies of his poems.

However, many contemporaries and later critics have contended over whether a couple of Lindsay&#x27;s poems should be seen as homages to African and African-American music, as perpetuation of the &quot;savage African&quot; stereotype, or as both. DuBois, before reading and praising &quot;the Golden-Faced People,&quot; wrote in a review of Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;Booker T. Washington Trilogy&quot; that &quot;Lindsay knows two things, and two things only, about Negroes: The beautiful rhythm of their music and the ugly side of their drunkards and outcasts. From this poverty of material he tries now and then to make a contribution to Negro literature. ... It goes without saying that he only partially succeeds.&quot; Added DuBois: &quot;Mr. Lindsay knows little of the Negro, and that little is dangerous.&quot; DuBois also criticized &quot;The Congo,&quot; which has been the most persistent focus of the criticisms of racial stereotyping in Lindsay&#x27;s work.

Subtitled &quot;A Study of the Negro Race&quot; and beginning with a section titled &quot;Their Basic Savagery&quot;, &quot;The Congo&quot; reflects the tensions within a relatively isolated and pastoral society suddenly confronted by the industrialized world. The poem was inspired by a sermon preached in October 1913 that detailed the drowning of a missionary in the Congo River; this event had drawn worldwide criticism, as had the colonial exploitation of the Congo under the government of Leopold II of Belgium. Lindsay defended the poem; in a letter to Joel Spingarn, chairman of the board of directors of the NAACP, Lindsay wrote that &quot;My &#x27;Congo&#x27; and &#x27;Booker T. Washington Trilogy&#x27; have both been denounced by the Colored people for reasons that I cannot fathom... The third section of &#x27;The Congo&#x27; is certainly as hopeful as any human being dare to be in regard to any race.&quot; Spingarn responded by acknowledging Lindsay&#x27;s good intentions, but saying that Lindsay sometimes glamorized differences between people of African descent and people of other races, while many African-Americans wished to emphasize the &quot;feelings and desires&quot; that they held in common with others.

Similarly, critics in academia often portray Lindsay as a well-meaning but misguided primitivist in his representations of Africans and African Americans. One such critic, Rachel DuPlessis, argues that the poem, while perhaps meant to be &quot;hopeful,&quot; actually &quot;others&quot; Africans as an inherently violent race. In the poem and in Lindsay&#x27;s defenses of it, DuPlessis hears Lindsay warning white readers not to be &quot;hoo-doo&#x27;d&quot; or seduced by violent African &quot;mumbo jumbo.&quot; This warning seems to suggest that white civilization has been &quot;infected&quot; by African violence; Lindsay thus, in effect, &quot;blames blacks for white violence directed against them.&quot; Conversely, Susan Gubar notes approvingly that &quot;the poem contains lines blaming black violence on white imperialism.&quot; While acknowledging that the poem seems to have given its author and audiences an excuse to indulge in &quot;&#x27;romantic racism&#x27; or &#x27;slumming in slang,&#x27;&quot; she also observes that Lindsay was &quot;much more liberal than many of his poetic contemporaries,&quot; and that he seems to have intended a statement against the kind of racist violence perpetrated under Leopold in the Congo.

==Later years==

===Fame===
Lindsay&#x27;s fame as a poet grew in the 1910s. Because Harriet Monroe showcased him with two other Illinois poets—Carl Sandburg and Edgar Lee Masters—his name became linked to theirs. The success of either of the other two, in turn, seemed to help the third.

In 1932, Edgar Lee Masters published an article on modern poetry in The American Mercury that praised Lindsay extensively and wrote a biography of Lindsay in 1935 (four years after its subject&#x27;s death) entitled &quot;Vachel Lindsay: A Poet in America&quot;.

Lindsay himself indicated in the 1915 preface to &quot;The Congo&quot; that no less a figure than William Butler Yeats respected his work. Yeats felt they shared a concern for capturing the sound of the primitive and of singing in poetry. In 1915, Lindsay gave a poetry reading to President Woodrow Wilson and the entire Cabinet.

===Marriage, children and financial troubles===
Lindsay&#x27;s private life was rife with disappointments, such as his unsuccessful courtship in 1914 of fellow poet Sara Teasdale before she married rich businessman Ernst Filsinger. While this itself may have caused Lindsay to become more concerned with money, his financial pressures would greatly increase later on.

In 1924 he moved to Spokane, Washington, where he lived in room 1129 of the Davenport Hotel until 1929. On May 19, 1925, at age 45, he married 23-year-old Elizabeth Connor. The new pressure to support his considerably younger wife escalated when they had a daughter, Susan Doniphan Lindsay, in May 1926 (wife of Lord Amberley) and son Nicholas Cave Lindsay in September 1927.

Desperate for money, Lindsay undertook an exhausting string of readings throughout the East and Midwest from October 1928 through March 1929. During this time, &quot;Poetry magazine&quot; awarded him a lifetime achievement award of $500 (equivalent to about $ in today&#x27;s dollars). In April 1929, Lindsay and his family moved to the house of his birth in Springfield, Illinois, an expensive undertaking. In that same year, coinciding with the Stock Market Crash of 1929, Lindsay published two more poetry volumes: &quot;The Litany of Washington Street&quot; and &quot;Every Soul A Circus&quot;. He gained money by doing odd jobs throughout but in general earned very little during his travels.

===Suicide===
Crushed by financial worry and in failing health from his six-month road trip, Lindsay sank into depression. On December 5, 1931, he committed suicide by drinking a bottle of lye. His last words were: &quot;They tried to get me; I got them first!&quot;

===Legacy===
====Literary====

Lindsay, a versatile and prolific writer and poet, helped to &quot;keep alive the appreciation of poetry as a spoken art&quot; whose poetry was said to &quot;abound in meter and rhymes and is no shredded prose&quot;, had a traditional verse structure and was described by a contemporary in 1924 as &quot;pungent phrases, clinging cadences, dramatic energy, comic thrust, lyric seriousness and tragic intensity&quot;. Lindsay&#x27;s biographer, Dennis Camp, says that Lindsay&#x27;s ideas on &quot;civic beauty and civic tolerance&quot; were published in 1912 in his broadside &quot;The Gospel of Beauty&quot; and that later, in 1915, Lindsay published the first American study of film as an art form, &quot;The Art of The Moving Picture&quot;. Camp notes that on Lindsay&#x27;s tombstone is recorded a single word, &quot;Poet&quot;.

====Vachel Lindsay House====
The Illinois Historic Preservation Agency helps to maintain the Vachel Lindsay House at 603 South Fifth Street in Springfield, the site of Lindsay&#x27;s birth and death. The agency donated the house to the state, which then closed it for restoration at a cost of $1.5 million. As of October 8, 2014, the site was again open to the public, with guided tours available on Thursday to Sunday from 1 to 5 pm. Lindsay&#x27;s grave lies in Oak Ridge Cemetery. The bridge crossing the midpoint of Lake Springfield, built in 1934, is named in Lindsay&#x27;s honor.

====Archives====
The Vachel Lindsay Archive resides at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia. It comprises his personal papers, manuscripts of his works, correspondence, photographs, artworks, printing blocks, books from his personal library, and a comprehensive collection of books by and about Lindsay. 
The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a small collection of manuscripts and other items sent by Lindsay to Eugenia Graham.

<doc id="161038" wikidata="Q325381" url="?curid=161038" title="Michael Howard">
<text>Michael Howard, Baron Howard of Lympne (born Michael Hecht; 7 July 1941) is a British politician who was Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition from November 2003 to December 2005. He previously held cabinet positions in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, including Secretary of State for Employment, Secretary of State for the Environment and Home Secretary.

Howard was born in Swansea to a Jewish family, his father from Romania and his mother from Wales. He studied at Peterhouse, Cambridge, following which he joined the Young Conservatives. In 1964, he was called to the Bar and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1982. He first became a Member of Parliament at the 1983 general election, representing the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe. This quickly led to his promotion and Howard became Minister for Local Government in 1987. Under the premiership of John Major, he served as Secretary of State for Employment (1990–1992), Secretary of State for the Environment (1992–1993) and Home Secretary (1993–1997).

Following the Conservative Party&#x27;s landslide defeat at the 1997 general election, he unsuccessfully contested the leadership, and subsequently held the posts of Shadow Foreign Secretary (1997–1999) and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer (2001–2003). In November 2003, following the Conservative Party&#x27;s vote of no confidence in Iain Duncan Smith, Howard was elected to the leadership unopposed.

At the 2005 general election, the Conservatives gained 33 new seats in Parliament, including five from the Liberal Democrats; but this still gave them only 198 seats to Labour&#x27;s 355. Following the election, Howard resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and was succeeded by David Cameron. Howard did not contest his seat of Folkestone and Hythe in the 2010 general election and entered the House of Lords as Baron Howard of Lympne. Prior to Brexit, he was supportive of the Eurosceptic pressure group Leave Means Leave.

==Early life==

Howard was born Michael Hecht in Gorseinon, Swansea, son of Bernat Hecht (died 1966), who was born in Romania and came to Britain in 1939, and Hilda (), who had lived in Wales from the age of six months where her father was a draper in Llanelli. She was a cousin of the Landy family who had helped Bernat Hecht come to Britain. Both of Howard&#x27;s parents were from Jewish families. Howard&#x27;s grandmother was murdered at Auschwitz.

Bernat Hecht was a synagogue cantor who worked for his wife&#x27;s family drapery business, later establishing himself as a prominent local businessman, owning three shops in Llanelli. When Howard was six, his parents became naturalised as British subjects and the family name was changed to Howard.

Howard passed his eleven-plus exam in 1952 and then attended Llanelli Boys&#x27; Grammar School. He joined the Young Conservatives at age 15. He gained a place at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union in 1962. After taking a 2:1 in the first part of the economics tripos, he switched to law and graduated with a 2:2 in 1962.

Howard was one of a cluster of Conservative students at Cambridge University around this time, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cambridge Mafia&quot;, many of whom held high government office under Margaret Thatcher and John Major (see: Cambridge University Conservative Association). According to Kenneth Clarke, Howard briefly defected to the Labour Party in 1961 in protest against the former&#x27;s invitation to Oswald Mosley to speak to the CUCA. He had rejoined the Conservatives by the next year.

Howard was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1964 and specialised in employment and planning law. He continued his career at the Bar, becoming a practising Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1982 (unlike some barrister-MPs who were awarded the title as an honorific despite no longer practising at the Bar).

In the late 1960s Howard gained promotion within the Bow Group, becoming Chairman in April 1970. At the Conservative Party conference in October 1970, he made a notable speech commending the government for attempting to curb trade union power and also called for state aid to strikers&#x27; families to be reduced or stopped altogether, a policy which the Thatcher government pursued over a decade later.

In the 1970s, Howard was a leading advocate of British membership of the Common Market (EEC) and served on the board of the cross-party Britain in Europe group.

==Marriage==
In 1975, Howard married Sandra Paul. They have a son, born in 1976, and a daughter, born in 1977.

==Member of Parliament==
At the 1966 and 1970 general elections, Howard unsuccessfully contested the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Edge Hill, reinforcing his strong support for Liverpool F.C. which he has held since childhood.

In June 1982, Howard was selected to contest the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe in Kent after the sitting Conservative MP, Sir Albert Costain, decided to retire. Howard won the seat at the 1983 general election.

===In Government===
Howard gained quick promotion, becoming Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry in 1985 with responsibility for regulating the financial dealings of the City of London. This junior post became very important, as he oversaw the Big Bang introduction of new technology in 1986. Following the 1987 general election, he became Minister for Local Government. Following a proposal from backbench MP David Wilshire, he accepted the amendment which would become Section 28 (prohibiting local governments from the &quot;promotion&quot; of homosexuality) and defended its inclusion.

Howard guided the 1988 Local Government Finance Act through the House of Commons. The act brought in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s new system of local taxation, officially known as the Community Charge but almost universally nicknamed the &quot;poll tax&quot;. Howard personally supported the tax and won Thatcher&#x27;s respect for minimising the rebellion against it within the Conservative Party. After a period as Minister for Water and Planning in 1988–89, during which he was responsible for implementing water privatisation in England and Wales, Howard was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Employment in January 1990 following the resignation of Norman Fowler. He subsequently guided through legislation abolishing the closed shop, and campaigned vigorously for Thatcher in the first ballot of the 1990 Conservative leadership election, although he told her a day before she resigned that he felt she was not going to win and that John Major was better placed to defeat Michael Heseltine.

He retained his Cabinet post under John Major and campaigned against trade union power during the 1992 general election campaign. His work in the campaign led to his appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment in the reshuffle following the election. In this capacity he encouraged the United States to participate in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, but shortly afterwards he was appointed Home Secretary in a 1993 reshuffle precipitated by the sacking of Norman Lamont as Chancellor.

===Home Secretary===
As Home Secretary he pursued a tough approach to crime, summed up in his sound bite, &quot;prison works&quot;. During his tenure as Home Secretary, recorded crime fell by 16.8%. In 2010 Howard claimed a 45% decrease in crime since a 1993 study by Home Office criminologist Roger Tarling proved that prison worked though the prison population rose from 42,000 to nearly 85,000. Ken Clarke disagreed, pointing to a 60% recidivism rate amongst newly released prisoners and hinting that factors such as better household and vehicle security and better policing could be influencing crime rates, not just the incapacitation effect of removing offenders to prison.

Howard repeatedly clashed with judges and prison reformers as he sought to clamp down on crime through a series of &#x27;tough&#x27; measures, such as reducing the right to silence of defendants in their police interviews and at their trials as part of 1994&#x27;s Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. Howard voted for the reintroduction of the death penalty for the killing of police officers on duty and for murders carried out with firearms in 1983 and 1990. In 1993, he changed his mind and became opposed to the reintroduction of the death penalty and voted against it again in February 1994.

In 1993, following the murder of James Bulger, two eleven-year-old boys were convicted of his murder and sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty&#x27;s pleasure, with a recommended a minimum term of eight years. Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, ordered that the two boys should serve a minimum of ten years. The editors of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper handed a petition bearing nearly 280,000 signatures to Howard, in a bid to increase the time spent by both boys in custody. This campaign was successful, and the boys were kept in custody for a minimum of fifteen years, meaning that they would not be considered for release until February 2008, by which time they would be 25 years of age.

A former Master of the Rolls, Lord Donaldson, criticised Howard&#x27;s intervention, describing the increased tariff as &quot;institutionalised vengeance ... [by] a politician playing to the gallery&quot;. The increased minimum term was overturned in 1997 by the House of Lords, which ruled it was substantively &quot;ultra vires&quot;, and therefore &quot;unlawful&quot;, for the Home Secretary to decide on minimum sentences for young offenders. The High Court and European Court of Human Rights have since ruled that, though Parliament may set minimum and maximum terms for individual categories of crime, it is the responsibility of the trial judge, with the benefit of all the evidence and argument from both prosecution and defence counsel, to determine the minimum term in individual criminal cases.

====Controversies====
Howard&#x27;s reputation was damaged on 13 May 1997 when a critical inquiry into a series of prison escapes was published. Howard denied responsibility for the Prison Service&#x27;s operations and laid the blame with Director General Derek Lewis, who was sacked. Lewis sued the Home Office for wrongful dismissal and alleged that Howard had regularly interfered with the service&#x27;s operations, citing an instance in which Howard put &quot;extreme and unjustified pressure&quot; on him to suspend the governor of Parkhurst Prison (threatening to overrule him if he did not). In a television interview on &quot;Newsnight,&quot; Jeremy Paxman asked Howard whether he had in fact threatened to overrule Lewis, posing the question &quot;Did you threaten to overrule him?&quot; twelve times. Howard repeatedly said that he &quot;did not instruct him&quot;, ignoring the &quot;threaten&quot; part of the question. Paxman asked him again in another interview in 2004. Howard responded: &quot;Oh come on, Jeremy, are you really going back over that again? As it happens, I didn&#x27;t. Are you satisfied now?&quot; Secret Home Office papers partially vindicated Howard, but show that Howard asked a top civil servant if he had the power to overrule Lewis.

Shortly after the 1997 &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview, Ann Widdecombe, his former minister of state at the Home Office, made a statement in the House of Commons about the dismissal of Derek Lewis and remarked of Howard that there is &quot;something of the night&quot; about him. This much quoted comment is thought to have contributed to the failure of his 1997 bid for the Conservative Party leadership, including by Howard and Widdecombe and led to him being caricatured as a vampire, in part due to his Romanian ancestry. Such characterisations caused discontent among some members of Britain&#x27;s Jewish community.

In 1996 Howard, as Home Secretary, ordered the release of John Haase and Paul Bennett with royal pardons after 10 months of their 18-year prison sentences for heroin smuggling, after they had provided information leading to the seizure of firearms. In 2008 Haase and Bennett were convicted of having set up the weapons finds to earn them their release, and sentenced to 20 and 22 years in prison respectively.

===First attempt to win party leadership===
Following the 1997 resignation of John Major, Howard and William Hague ran on the same ticket, with Howard as leader and Hague as Deputy Leader and Party Chairman. The day after they agreed this, Hague decided to run on his own. Howard also stood but his campaign was marred by attacks on his record as Home Secretary.

Howard came in last out of five candidates with the support of only 23 MPs in the first round of polling for the leadership election. He then withdrew from the race and endorsed the eventual winner, William Hague. Howard served as Shadow Foreign Secretary for the next two years but retired from the Shadow cabinet in 1999, though continued as a backbench MP.

===Leader of the Opposition===

Following the Conservative defeat at the 2001 general election, Howard was recalled to frontline politics when the Conservative Party&#x27;s new leader, Iain Duncan Smith, appointed him Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. His performances in the post won him much praise; indeed, under his guidance, the Conservatives decided to debate the economy on an &#x27;Opposition Day&#x27; for the first time in several years. After Duncan Smith was removed from the leadership, Howard was elected unopposed as leader of the party in November 2003.

As leader, he faced much less discontent within the party than any of his three predecessors and was seen as a steady hand. He avoided repeating such managerial missteps as Duncan Smith&#x27;s firing of David Davis as Conservative Party Chairman and imposed discipline quickly and firmly: for example, he removed the party whip from Ann Winterton after she joked about 23 Chinese migrants&#x27; deaths. In the lead up to the 2005 election campaign, Howard continued to impose strong party discipline, controversially forcing the deselection of at least four candidates. Danny Kruger was made to resign in Sedgefield after he said that the Conservatives &quot;plan to introduce a period of creative destruction in the public services&quot;. He was later selected and elected as the Conservative MP for Devizes in 2019. Robert Oulds and Adrian Hilton were successively sacked as candidates for Slough–Oulds after he was photographed with a number of firearms and dubbed a &quot;Tory gun nut&quot; by &quot;The Sun&quot;; and Hilton after a piece he wrote for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 2003 came to public attention, in which he claimed that &quot;a Catholic EU will inevitably result in the subjugation of Britain&#x27;s Protestant ethos to Roman Catholic social, political and religious teaching&quot;. Most prominently, incumbent MP and then-Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party Howard Flight was deselected in Arundel and South Downs, for a speech at a Conservative Way Forward meeting that suggested that the Conservatives would make much greater spending cuts than they promised in their manifesto, if they won the election.

In February 2004, Howard called on then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to resign over the Iraq War, for failing to ask &quot;basic questions&quot; regarding WMD claims and misleading Parliament. In July, the Conservative leader stated that he would not have voted for the motion that authorised the Iraq War had he known the quality of intelligence information on which the WMD claims were based. At the same time, he said he still believed in the Iraq invasion was right because &quot;the prize of a stable Iraq was worth striving for&quot;. However, Howard&#x27;s criticism of Blair was not received favourably in Washington, D.C., where President of the United States George W. Bush refused to meet him. Bush&#x27;s advisor Karl Rove reportedly told Howard, &quot;you can forget about meeting the president. Don&#x27;t bother coming.&quot;

Howard was named 2003 Parliamentarian of the Year by &quot;The Spectator&quot; and Zurich UK. This was in recognition of his performance at the dispatch box in his previous role as Shadow Chancellor. However, twelve months after he became party leader, neither his personal popularity nor his party&#x27;s with the public had risen appreciably in opinion polls from several years before.

Howard was part of discussions for British Airways to resume flights to Pakistan in 2003, this was until their final departure in 2008 the only European airline serving the nation.

====Further Newsnight treatment====
In November 2004, &quot;Newsnight&quot; again concentrated on Howard with coverage of a campaign trip to Cornwall and an interview with Jeremy Paxman. The piece, which purported to show that members of the public could not identify Howard and that those who recognised him did not support him, was the subject of an official complaint from the Conservative Party. The complaint argued that the &quot;Newsnight&quot; team spoke only to people who held opinions against either Michael Howard or the Conservatives and that Paxman&#x27;s style was bullying and unnecessarily aggressive. In this programme, Paxman also returned to his question from 1997. Howard returned briefly to &quot;Newsnight&quot; on Jeremy Paxman&#x27;s final episode on 18 June 2014 for a cameo.

====2005 general election====
At the 2005 general election, Howard&#x27;s Conservative Party suffered a third consecutive defeat, although the Conservatives gained 33 seats (including five from the Liberal Democrats) and Labour&#x27;s majority shrank from 167 to 66. The Conservatives were left with 198 seats to Labour&#x27;s 355. The Conservative share of the national vote increased by 0.6% from 2001 and 1.6% from 1997. The party ended with 32.4% of the total votes cast, which was within 3% of Labour on 35.2%.

The day after the election, Howard stated in a speech in the newly gained Conservative seat in Putney that he would not lead the party into the next general election as, already aged 63, he would be &quot;too old&quot; by that stage, and that he would stand down &quot;sooner rather than later&quot;, following a revision of the Conservative leadership electoral process. Despite Labour winning a third term in government, Howard described the election as &quot;the beginning of a recovery&quot; for the Conservative Party following Labour&#x27;s landslide victories in 1997 and 2001.

Howard&#x27;s own constituency of Folkestone and Hythe had been heavily targeted by the Liberal Democrats as the most sought after prize of their failed &quot;decapitation&quot; strategy of seeking to gain seats from prominent Conservatives. Yet Howard almost doubled his majority to 11,680, while the Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall.

====Criticism of 2005 campaign====
During the 2005 general election campaign, Howard was criticised by some commentators for conducting a campaign which addressed the issues of immigration, asylum seekers, and travellers. Others noted that the continued media coverage of such issues created most of the controversy and that Howard merely defended his views when questioned at unrelated policy launches.

Some evidence suggested that the public generally supported policies proposed by the Conservative Party when they were not told which party had proposed them, indicating that the party still had an image problem. Conservative John Major&#x27;s 30% lead in 1992 amongst the sought after ABC1 voters (professionals) had all but disappeared by 2005.

The campaign focus on immigration may have been influenced by Howard&#x27;s election adviser Lynton Crosby, who had run similar tactics in Australian elections earlier. Crosby was later re-hired by the Conservative Party to run their successful campaign in the 2008 London mayoral election.

===Resignation===
Despite his impending resignation following the 2005 general election, Howard performed a substantial reshuffle of the party&#x27;s front bench in which several rising star MPs were given their first shadow portfolios, including George Osborne and David Cameron. This move cleared the way for David Cameron (who had worked for Howard as a Special Advisor when the latter was Home Secretary) to run for the Conservative Party leadership.

The reforms to the party&#x27;s election process took several months and Howard remained in his position for six months following the election. During that period, he enjoyed a fairly pressure-free time, often making joking comparisons between himself and Tony Blair, both of whom had declared they would not stand at the next general election. He also oversaw Blair&#x27;s first parliamentary defeat, when the Conservative Party, the Liberal Democrats and sufficient Labour Party rebels voted against government proposals to extend to 90 days the period that terror suspects could be held for without charge. Howard stood down as Leader in December 2005 and was replaced by David Cameron.

==Retirement==

Howard announced on 17 March 2006 that he would stand down as MP for Folkestone and Hythe at the 2010 general election. 
On 13 July 2006 the Conservatives selected Damian Collins to stand in his place at that election.

On 19 June 2006 it was reported that Howard would become chairman of Diligence Europe, a private intelligence and risk assessment company founded by former CIA and MI5 members.

On 23 October 2006, Howard said that he had voluntarily been questioned as a potential witness as part of the investigation into the Cash-for-Honours scandal relating to fundraising for the 2005 election campaign. He was not suspected of any criminal activity, was not accused of any criminal activity, and gave evidence purely as a witness in an investigation focusing primarily on the Labour Government&#x27;s use of the peerages system and their party fundraising.

Howard was appointed a Conservative life peer in the 2010 Dissolution Honours with the title of Baron Howard of Lympne, of Lympne in the County of Kent. On 20 July 2010, he was formally introduced into the House of Lords by past colleague Norman Lamont, and attended Questions and debate later that day.

In 2010, David Cameron wanted Howard to join his Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, possibly as Lord Chancellor, via the House of Lords as part of David Cameron&#x27;s appeal to rightwing Tories. However, it did not happen, Howard having criticised the government&#x27;s proposal for a &#x27;rehabilitation revolution&#x27;.
In February 2011 there was increased speculation that Cameron would reshuffle his cabinet, with Lord Howard brought in to replace Kenneth Clarke as Secretary of State for Justice. Instead, Chris Grayling was appointed.

Howard was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 2011 Birthday Honours for public and political services.

A few days after Article 50 was triggered for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, Howard was interviewed on 2 April 2017 by Sophy Ridge for her programme on Sky News. He compared the post-Brexit situation of Gibraltar&#x27;s disputed sovereignty with Spain with the resolution of a similar issue by the Falklands War in 1982. Howard said he was &quot;absolutely certain&quot; Theresa May &quot;will show the same resolve in standing by the people of Gibraltar&quot; as Margaret Thatcher had done in the South Atlantic. Leading figures from the other parties rejected this viewpoint. A spokesman for Number 10 said such a conflict &quot;isn&#x27;t going to happen&quot;.

In June 2022, Howard called on Boris Johnson to resign as Prime Minister.

===Criticism of Somali business interests===
In 2015, Soma Oil &amp; Gas, which Howard chairs, was investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. On 14 December 2016, the SFO closed its investigation of Soma, citing insufficient evidence of corruption.

===Charity work===
Howard is a keen supporter of the hospice movement and was chairman of Hospice UK from 2010 until 2018.

<doc id="161041" wikidata="Q58282" url="?curid=161041" title="William Hague">
<text>William Jefferson Hague, Baron Hague of Richmond (born 26 March 1961) is a British politician and life peer who was Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1997 to 2001 and Deputy Leader from 2005 to 2010. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) in North Yorkshire from 1989 to 2015. He was in the Cameron government as First Secretary of State from 2010 to 2015, Foreign Secretary from 2010 to 2014, and Leader of the House of Commons from 2014 to 2015. He has been Chancellor of the University of Oxford since February 2025.

Hague was educated at Wath-upon-Dearne Comprehensive School, the University of Oxford and INSEAD, subsequently being elected to the House of Commons at a by-election in 1989. Hague quickly rose through the ranks of the government of John Major and was appointed to Cabinet in 1995 as Secretary of State for Wales. Following the Conservatives&#x27; defeat at the 1997 general election by the Labour Party, he was elected Leader of the Conservative Party at the age of 36. Hague resigned as Conservative leader after the 2001 general election following his party&#x27;s second defeat, at which the Conservatives made a net gain of just one seat. He returned to the backbenches, pursuing a career as an author, writing biographies of William Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce. He also held several directorships, and worked as a consultant and public speaker. He was the first Leader of the Conservative Party since Austen Chamberlain (1921–22) to never assume the office of Prime Minister.

After David Cameron was elected Leader of the Conservative Party in 2005, Hague was reappointed to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Foreign Secretary. He also assumed the role of Senior Member of the Shadow Cabinet, serving as Cameron&#x27;s deputy. Following the formation of the coalition government in 2010, Hague was appointed First Secretary of State and Foreign Secretary. Cameron described him as his &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; political deputy&quot;. On 14 July 2014, Hague stood down as Foreign Secretary and became Leader of the House of Commons. He did not stand for re-election at the 2015 general election and was succeeded, as MP for Richmond, by Rishi Sunak. He was awarded a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours List on 9 October 2015.

==Early life and education==

Hague was born on 26 March 1961 in Rotherham, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. He initially boarded at Ripon Grammar School and then attended Wath-upon-Dearne Comprehensive School, a state secondary school near Rotherham. His parents, Nigel and Stella Hague, ran a soft drinks manufacturing business where he worked during school holidays.

He first made the national news at the age of 16 by addressing the Conservatives at their 1977 Annual National Conference. In his speech he told the delegates: &quot;half of you won&#x27;t be here in 30 or 40 years&#x27; time..., but that others would have to live with consequences of a Labour Government if it stayed in power&quot;. Writing in his diary at the time Kenneth Rose noted that Peter Carrington told him that &quot;he and several other frontbench Tories were nauseated by the much-heralded speech of a sixteen-year-old schoolboy called William Hague. Peter said to Norman St John-Stevas: &#x27;If he is as priggish and self-assured as that at sixteen, what will he be like in thirty years&#x27; time? Norman replied: &#x27;Like Michael Heseltine&#x27;&quot;.

Hague read Philosophy, politics and economics at Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with first-class honours &quot;after last-minute cramming&quot;. He was President of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), but was &quot;convicted of electoral malpractice&quot; in the election process of his successor. OUCA&#x27;s official historian, David Blair, notes that Hague was actually elected on a platform pledging to clean up OUCA, but that this was &quot;tarnished by accusations that he misused his position as Returning Officer to help the Magdalen candidate for the presidency, Peter Havey. Hague was playing the classic game of using his powers as President to keep his faction in power, and Havey was duly elected... There were accusations of blatant ballot box stuffing&quot;. He also served as President of the Oxford Union, an established route into politics.

After Oxford, Hague went on to study for a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree at INSEAD, where he graduated with Distinction in 1986. He often refers to the year he spent there, living in Fontainebleau with friends from all over the world, as one of the happiest of his life. After the MBA, Hague got recruited and then worked as a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, where Archie Norman was his mentor.

==Public life==
===Early political career===
Hague contested Wentworth unsuccessfully in 1987, before being elected to Parliament at a by-election in 1989 as Member for the safe Conservative seat of Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he succeeded former Home Secretary Leon Brittan. Following his election he became the then-youngest Conservative MP and despite having only recently become an MP, Hague was invited to join the Government in 1990, serving as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont. After Lamont was sacked in 1993, Hague moved to the Department of Social Security (DSS) where he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. The following year he was promoted as Minister of State in the DSS with responsibility for Social Security and Disabled People. His fast rise up through Government ranks was attributed to his intelligence and debating skills.

Hague was appointed a Cabinet Minister in 1995 as Secretary of State for Wales; succeeding John Redwood, who had been castigated for being seen on TV apparently miming the Welsh national anthem at a conference; thus, Hague sought a Welsh Office civil servant, Ffion Jenkins, to teach him the words; they later married. He continued serving in Cabinet until the Conservatives were defeated after 18 years in government, by Labour at the 1997 general election.

===Leadership of the Conservative Party===

Following the 1997 general election defeat, Hague was elected Leader of the Conservative Party in succession to John Major, defeating more experienced figures such as Kenneth Clarke and Michael Howard. At the age of 36, Hague was tasked with rebuilding the Conservative Party (fresh from their worst general election result of the 20th century) by attempting to build a more modern image. £250,000 was spent on the &quot;Listening to Britain&quot; campaign to try to put the Conservatives back in touch with the public after losing power; he welcomed ideas about &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; including from the then-Governor of Texas, later President George W. Bush.

Hague led the Conservatives to a successful result at the European parliamentary elections in June 1999, where the Conservatives gained 18 MEPs compared to Labour&#x27;s loss of 33 MEPs.

Hague&#x27;s authority was challenged by the appointment of Michael Portillo as Shadow Chancellor in 2000. Portillo had been widely tipped to be the next Conservative Party Leader before dramatically losing his seat at the 1997 general election; he was elected as MP for Kensington and Chelsea at a by-election two years later. Soon after Portillo&#x27;s return to Parliament, Conservative policy on two of Labour&#x27;s flagship policies was reversed: the minimum wage and independence of the Bank of England. From then and until the 2001 general election Hague&#x27;s supporters waged an increasingly bitter battle with Portillo&#x27;s faction; such internecine infighting significantly contributed to the Conservatives&#x27; two subsequent election defeats.

Hague was widely ridiculed for claiming he used to drink &quot;14 pints of beer a day&quot; as a teenager. His reputation suffered further damage when a 2001 poll for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found that 66% of voters considered him to be &quot;a bit of a &quot;, and 70% of voters believed he would &quot;say almost anything to win votes&quot;.

====&quot;Foreign Land&quot; speech====
At a Party Conference speech in March 2001, Hague said:

Former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, a prominent One-nation Conservative, was critical of Hague&#x27;s Eurosceptic view that Britain was becoming a &quot;foreign land&quot;, betraying in newspaper interviews that he was uncertain as to whether he could support a Hague-led Conservative Party.

====Skill in debate====
Hague&#x27;s critics assiduously monitored his performance at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions each Wednesday in Parliament, having difficulty to find fault. During one particular exchange, while responding to the Queen&#x27;s Speech of 2000, Hague attacked Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s record:

Blair responded by criticising what he saw as Hague&#x27;s &quot;bandwagon politics&quot;:

====Resignation====
On the morning of Labour&#x27;s second consecutive landslide victory at the 2001 general election, Hague stated: &quot;we have not been able to persuade a majority, or anything approaching a majority, that we are yet the alternative government that they need.&quot; At that election the Conservative Party gained just one parliamentary seat more than at the 1997 general election; following this defeat, Hague resigned as party leader. Hague thus became the second twentieth century Conservative party leader not to become Prime Minister (after Austen Chamberlain) and the first ever to spend his entire tenure in Opposition.

===Backbenches===
On the backbenches he occasionally spoke in the House of Commons on issues of the day. Between 1997 and 2002, he was the Chairman of the International Democrat Union. Hague&#x27;s profile and personal popularity rose thereafter among both Conservative Party members and the wider public following his spell as Party Leader. He has written a biography of 18th-century Prime Minister Pitt the Younger (published in 2004), taught himself how to play the piano, and hosted the 25th anniversary programme for Radio 4 on the political television satire &quot;Yes Minister&quot; in 2005. In June 2007 he published his second book, a biography of the anti-slave trade campaigner William Wilberforce, shortlisted for the 2008 Orwell Prize for political writing.

Hague&#x27;s annual income was the highest in Parliament, with earnings of about £400,000 a year from directorships, consultancy, speeches and his parliamentary salary. His income was previously estimated at £1 million annually, but he dropped several commitments and in effect took a salary cut of some £600,000 on becoming Shadow Foreign Secretary in 2005.

Together with former Prime Minister John Major, former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, and Hague&#x27;s successor Iain Duncan Smith, Hague served for a time on the Conservative Leadership Council, which was set up by Michael Howard upon his election unopposed as Leader of the Conservative Party in 2003.

At the 2005 Conservative leadership election he supported the eventual winner David Cameron.
He is a member of Conservative Friends of Israel, a group which he joined when he was 15.

===Return to the Shadow Cabinet===
Following the 2005 general election, the Conservative Party Leader Michael Howard apparently offered Hague the post of Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, which he turned down citing that his business commitments would make it difficult for him to take on such a high-profile job.

On 6 December 2005, David Cameron was elected Leader of the Conservative Party. Hague was offered and accepted the role of Shadow Foreign Secretary and Senior Member of the Shadow cabinet, effectively serving as Cameron&#x27;s deputy (though not formally, unlike previous Deputy Conservative Leaders Willie Whitelaw, Peter Lilley and Michael Ancram). He had been widely tipped to return to the frontbench under either Cameron or leadership contest runner-up David Davis.

On 30 January 2006, by Cameron&#x27;s instructions, Hague travelled to Brussels for talks to pull Conservative Party MEPs out of the European People&#x27;s Party–European Democrats Group (EPP-ED) in the European Parliament. (&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, 30 January 2006). Further, on 15 February 2006, Hague deputed, during David Cameron&#x27;s paternity leave, at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions (PMQs). This appearance gave rise to jokes at the expense of Blair, that all three parties that day were being led by &#x27;stand-ins&#x27;, with the Liberal Democrats represented by Acting Leader Sir Menzies Campbell, the Labour Party by the departing Blair, and the Conservatives by Hague. Hague again deputised for Cameron for several sessions in 2006.

===Foreign Secretary===

Prime Minister Cameron&#x27;s first appointment was Hague as Foreign Secretary. He was also accorded the honorary title of First Secretary of State. In his first overseas visit as British Foreign Secretary, Hague met US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, at Washington.

In August 2010, Hague set out a values-based foreign policy, stating that: &quot;We cannot have a foreign policy without a conscience. Foreign policy is domestic policy written large. The values we live by at home do not stop at our shores. Human rights are not the only issue that informs the making of foreign policy, but they are indivisible from it, not least because the consequences of foreign policy failure are human&quot;.

Hague further said that: &quot;There will be no downgrading of human rights under this Government and no resiling from our commitments to aid and development&quot;. He continued by saying: &quot;Indeed I intend to improve and strengthen our human rights work. It is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience, and neither is it in our interests&quot;. However, in March 2011, Hague was criticised by Cardinal Keith O&#x27;Brien for increasing financial aid to Pakistan despite persecution of its Christian minority: &quot;To increase aid to the Pakistan Government when religious freedom is not upheld and those who speak up for religious freedom are gunned down is tantamount to an anti-Christian foreign policy&quot;.

In September 2011, Hague told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;File on 4&quot; investigation &quot;Cyber Spies&quot; into the legality of domestic cyber surveillance and the export of this technology from the UK to countries with questionable human rights records that the UK had a strong export licence system. The programme also obtained confirmation from the UK&#x27;s Department for Business Innovation and Skills that cyber surveillance products that break, as opposed to create, encryption do not require export licences.

In June 2012, he continued to stand in for David Cameron at PMQs when both the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg were out of the country.

In January 2013, Hague visited New Zealand in his capacity as Foreign Secretary, holding talks with New Zealand government ministers, Murray McCully and David Shearer. In March 2013, Hague established the International Leaders Programme, designed to identify and develop partnerships among future global leaders.

==== Media reaction to FCO appointment ====

In early September 2010, newspapers including &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &#x27;the &#x27;Daily Mail&quot; released stories about allegations surrounding Hague&#x27;s friendship with 25-year-old Christopher Myers, a history graduate from Durham University, whom he employed as a parliamentary special adviser. A spokesperson stated that &quot;Any suggestion that the Foreign Secretary&#x27;s relationship with Chris Myers is anything other than a purely professional one is wholly inaccurate and unfounded.&quot;

On 1 September 2010, Myers resigned from his appointment in light of that press speculation, which prompted Hague to issue a public statement, wherein he confirmed that he had &quot;occasionally&quot; shared a hotel room with Myers [for reasons of frugality by upbringing], but refuting the &quot;utterly false&quot; suggestions that he had ever been involved in a relationship with man. A spokesperson for Prime Minister David Cameron reported that he gave his &quot;full support&quot; over the media rumours. Figures from both within and without the Conservative Party criticised Hague for his personal response to the stories, with former Conservative leadership candidate, John Redwood, commenting that Hague had shown &quot;poor judgement&quot;, and the Speaker&#x27;s wife, Labour-supporting Sally Bercow, speculating that Hague had been given &quot;duff PR advice&quot;, whilst a parliamentary and ministerial colleague, the Conservative MP, Alan Duncan, described the media coverage as &quot;contemptible&quot;.

====Israel–Palestinian conflict====
Hague was criticised by Israeli leaders after meeting with Palestinians who demonstrated against Israel&#x27;s barrier in the West Bank. He expressed solidarity with the idea of non-violence and listened to the accounts of left-wing and Palestinian activists. Israeli Opposition Leader Tzipi Livni condemned the statements and said:

The security barrier has saved lives, and its construction was necessary. The barrier has separated Israel from Palestinian cities and completely changed the reality in Israel, where citizens were exposed to terror every day.

====2011 Middle East protests====

In February 2011 security forces in the Bahrain dispersed thousands of anti-government protesters at Pearl Square in the centre of the capital, Manama. Hague informed the House of Commons that he had stressed the need for peaceful action in dealing with the protesters: &quot;At least three people died in the operation, with hundreds more injured. We are greatly concerned about the deaths that have occurred. I have this morning spoken to the Foreign Minister of Bahrain and HM Ambassador spoke last night to the Bahraini Minister of the Interior. In both cases we stressed the need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters, the importance of respect for the right to peaceful protest and for freedom of expression&quot;.

Hague told &quot;Sky News&quot; that the use of force by the Libyan authorities during the 2011 Libyan Civil War was &quot;dreadful and horrifying&quot; and called on the leader to respect people&#x27;s human rights. A vicious crackdown led by special forces, foreign mercenaries and Muammar Gaddafi loyalists was launched in the country&#x27;s second city Benghazi, which has been the focus of anti-regime protests. Hague stated to Dermot Murnaghan on &quot;Sky&quot;: &quot;I think we have to increase the international pressure and condemnation. The United Kingdom condemns what the Libyan Government has been doing and how they have responded to these protests, and we look to other countries to do the same&quot;.
Following delays in extracting British citizens from Libya, a disastrous helicopter attempt to contact the protesters ending with eight British diplomats/SAS arrested and no aircraft carriers or Harriers to enforce a no-fly zone he was accused, by the Labour Opposition, of &quot;losing his mojo&quot; in March 2011.

In March 2011, Hague said in a speech to business leaders that the examples being set in North Africa and the Middle East will ultimately transform the relationship between governments and their populations in the region. However following the row over whether Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was being targeted by coalition forces, the Foreign Secretary stated that the Libyan people must be free to determine their own future. Hague said: &quot;It is not for us to choose the government of Libya—that is for the Libyan people themselves. But they have a far greater chance of making that choice now than they did on Saturday, when the opposition forces were on the verge of defeat.&quot;

Hague has warned that autocratic leaders including Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, could be shaken and even toppled by a wave of popular uprisings rippling out from North Africa. He said that recent revolts against authoritarian leaders in countries including Libya and Egypt will have a greater historic significance than the 9/11 attacks on the US or the recent financial crisis. He stopped short of threatening military intervention against other dictators, but warned that they will inevitably face &quot;judgement&quot; for oppressing their people and suppressing democracy. Repressive African regimes will also face challenges from their populations and from the international community, Hague said: &quot;Demands for freedom will spread, and that undemocratic governments elsewhere should take heed.&quot; He added: &quot;Governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever. They will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease, and will find themselves on the wrong side of history.&quot;

Hague, on his way to Qatar Summit in April 2011, called for intensified sanctions on the Libyan regime and for a clear statement that Gaddafi must go: &quot;we have sent more ground strike aircraft in order to protect civilians. We do look to other countries to do the same, if necessary, over time&quot;. &quot;We would like a continued increase in our (NATO&#x27;s) capability to protect civilians in Libya&quot;, he added. Whether NATO ratcheted up operations depended on what happened on the ground, Hague said. &quot;These air strikes are a response to movements of, or attacks from, regime forces so what happens will be dependent on that&quot;, he said. Whether the Americans could again be asked to step up their role would also &quot;depend on the circumstances&quot;, he added.

Hague, speaking on the protests in Syria, said: &quot;Political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay.&quot; It is thought as many as 60 people were killed by security forces in the country on 22 April 2011, making it the worst day for deaths since protests against President Bashar al-Assad began over a month prior, reported BBC News.

====Syria====

Speaking on the Syrian civil war, in August 2011, Hague said of military intervention: &quot;It&#x27;s not a remote possibility. Even if we were in favour [of UN-backed military action], which we are not because there&#x27;s no call from the Arab League for intervention as in the case of Libya, there is no prospect of a legal, morally sanctioned military intervention. Hague added that it was a &quot;frustrating situation&quot; and that the &quot;levers&quot; at the international community&#x27;s disposal were severely limited but said countries had to concentrate on other ways of influencing the Assad government. &quot;We want to see stronger international pressure all round. Of course, to be effective that just can&#x27;t be pressure from Western nations, that includes from Arab nations... and it includes from Turkey who has been very active in trying to persuade President Assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling actions&quot;, he said. &quot;I would also like to see a United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn this violence, to call for the release of political prisoners, to call for legitimate grievances to be responded to&quot;, he added.

During 2012, the UK started training Syrian opposition activists in Istanbul on media, civil society and local government matters, and supplying non-lethal equipment such as satellite communications and computers.

On 24 February 2012, Hague recognised the Syrian National Council as a &quot;legitimate representative&quot; of the country. Hague also said Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government had &quot;forfeited the right to lead&quot; by &quot;miring itself in the blood of innocent people&quot;. Hague said: &quot;Today we must show that we will not abandon the Syrian people in their darkest hour&quot;. He added that &quot;Those responsible for the murder of entire families, the shelling of homes, the execution of detainees, the cleansing of political opponents and the torture and rape of women and children must be held to account&quot;, he said.

In March 2012, Hague ordered the evacuation of all British diplomats from Syria and closed the UK embassy in Damascus because of mounting security threats. Hague told Parliament: &quot;We have maintained an embassy in Damascus despite the violence to help us communicate with all parties in Syria and to provide insight into the situation on the ground&quot;. He added: &quot;We now judge that the deterioration of the security situation in Damascus puts our embassy staff and premises at risk.&quot; Hague said that his decision &quot;in no way reduces the UK&#x27;s commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on the Assad regime to end the violence&quot;. He went on to say that: &quot;We will continue to work closely with other nations to co-ordinate diplomatic and economic pressure on the Syrian regime.&quot;
On 1 April 2012, Hague met 74 other nations at a Friends of Syria Group conference in Istanbul, Turkey. Hague said the issue could return to the United Nations Security Council if current efforts to resolve the crisis fail. The government of President Assad has said it accepts a peace plan by the UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, but there has been little evidence that it is prepared to end its crackdown on the opposition. Hague accused Assad of &quot;stalling for time&quot; and warned that if the issue does return to the Security Council, he may no longer be able to rely on the backing of Russia and China, who blocked a previous resolution calling for him to stand down. &quot;There isn&#x27;t an unlimited period of time for this, for the Kofi Annan process to work before many of the nations here want us to go back to the UN Security Council—some of them will call for arming the opposition if there isn&#x27;t progress made,&quot; Hague told the BBC. He added that &quot;What is now being put to them is a plan from Kofi Annan supported by the whole United Nations Security Council, and this is an important point, it&#x27;s supported by Russia and by China as well as by the more obvious countries—the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Arab League and so on&quot;.

On 20 November 2012, Hague recognised the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the &quot;sole legitimate representative&quot; of the Syrian people, and a credible alternative to the current Syrian Government.

On 29 August 2013, the British Parliament refused to ratify the British Government&#x27;s plan to participate in military strikes against the Syrian Government in the wake of a chemical-weapons attack at Ghouta. Hague denied suggestions that he had threatened to resign over Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s decision to go straight to a parliamentary vote. After the vote, Hague continued to urge other governments to take action against the Syrian Government, saying &quot;If it is decided in the various parliaments of the world that no-one will stand up to the use of chemical weapons and take any action about that, that would be a very alarming moment in the affairs of the world&quot;. Ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate Syria&#x27;s chemical weapons.

====Proposal of elected EU presidency====

In June 2011, Hague dismissed Tony Blair&#x27;s vision for an elected-head of the European Union by insisting that member states have more pressing priorities than further &quot;constitutional tinkering&quot;. Hague made clear his view after Blair argued that a directly elected President of Europe, representing almost 400m people from 27 countries, would give the EU clear leadership and enormous authority. In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, Blair set out the agenda that he thought a directly elected EU President should pursue, although he conceded, there was &quot;no chance&quot; of such a post being created &quot;at the present time&quot;. Asked about the former Prime Minister&#x27;s call for further European integration and the creation of an elected-President, Hague suggested that Blair may have been thinking of the role for himself. &quot;I can&#x27;t think who he had in mind&quot;, Hague joked, further adding on a serious note: &quot;Elected presidents are for countries. The EU is not a country and it&#x27;s not going to become a country, in my view, now or ever in the future. It is a group of countries working together&quot;.

====Taliban talks====
In June 2011, Hague said that Britain helped initiate &quot;distasteful&quot; peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Hague made the comments while on a three-day tour of the country to meet President Hamid Karzai and visited British troops. He told &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper that Britain had led the way in persuading US President Barack Obama&#x27;s administration that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict. Hague admitted that any deal might mean accepting &quot;distasteful things&quot; and could anger military veterans and relatives of the 374 British troops killed in Afghanistan. However, he said he believed that Britain as a whole was &quot;realistic and practical&quot; enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security. He told the newspaper: &quot;An eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security.&quot; He added, &quot;but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful. In all these types of situations, you do have to face up to some distasteful things.&quot; The previous night US President Barack Obama told Americans that &quot;the tide of war is receding&quot; as he announced plans to withdraw 33,000 US troops from Afghanistan by September 2012.

====Comments on the Euro====
In September 2011, Hague said that the Euro is &quot;a burning building with no exits&quot; for some of the countries which adopted the currency. Hague first used the expression when he was Conservative Leader in 1998—and said in an interview with &quot;The Spectator&quot; he had been proved right: &quot;It was folly to create this system. It will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly. But it&#x27;s there and we have to deal with it,&quot; he said. &quot;I described the Euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it,&quot; he further said, adding &quot;I might take the analogy too far but the Euro wasn&#x27;t built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it&quot;.

====Iran====
In February 2012, Hague warned in a BBC interview about Iran&#x27;s &quot;increasing willingness to contemplate&quot; terrorism around the world. He cited the 2011 Iran assassination plot, an attempt to assassinate Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, as well as alleged involvement in recent attacks in New Delhi, Georgia, and Bangkok. He said it showed &quot;the danger Iran is currently presenting to the peace of the world&quot;.

Hague spoke the Commons on 20 February about the nuclear program of Iran and said that if the Tehran regime managed to construct a viable weapon, its neighbours would be forced to build their own nuclear warheads too. He accused Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of pursuing &quot;confrontational policies&quot; and described the country&#x27;s enrichment of uranium in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions as &quot;a crisis coming steadily down the track&quot;. &quot;Our policy is that whilst we remain unswervingly committed to diplomacy, it is important to emphasise to Iran that all options are on the table,&quot; Hague told MPs.

In March he condemned the way parliamentary elections were staged, claiming they were not &quot;free and fair&quot;. He said the poll had been held against a backdrop of fear that meant the result would not reflect the will of the people. Hague said: &quot;It has been clear for some time that these elections would not be free and fair. &quot;The regime has presented the vote as a test of loyalty, rather than an opportunity for people freely to choose their own representatives. The climate of fear, created by the regime&#x27;s crushing of opposition voices since 2009, persists.&quot;

====Falkland Islands====
The 30th anniversary of the beginning of the 1982 Falklands War was on 2 April 2012. On 29 March, before the Lord Mayor of London&#x27;s banquet guests, namely the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than 100 ambassadors, including Alicia Castro (Argentinian Ambassador), Hague said the UK was keen to deepen its relationship with Latin America—and reiterated Britain&#x27;s commitment to the Falklands. He said: &quot;We are reversing Britain&#x27;s decline in Latin America, where we are opening a new Embassy in El Salvador. This determination to deepen our relations with Latin America is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of self-determination of the people of the Falkland Islands&quot;.

Tensions over the Falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary. In February, Hague said deployments of a British warship, HMS &quot;Dauntless&quot; and the Duke of Cambridge to the Falklands were &quot;entirely routine&quot;. Hague said that Britain affirmed the Falklanders&#x27; self-determination and would seek to prevent Argentina from &quot;raising the diplomatic temperature&quot; over the issue. He further said: &quot;(the events) are not so much celebrations as commemorations. I think Argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict. Since both countries will be doing that I don&#x27;t think there is anything provocative about that.&quot;

====Turks and Caicos Islands====
Hague set out Her Majesty&#x27;s Government&#x27;s plans, on 12 June 2012, for the reintroduction of self-government in the Turks and Caicos Islands, where direct rule of the Governor had been in place since the islands had been subject to corruption and maladministration under the previous autonomous administration.

====Julian Assange and right of asylum====
In August 2012, Hague declared that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks organisation founder, would not be granted political asylum by the United Kingdom. Hague declared the UK&#x27;s willingness to extradite Assange to the Swedish authorities who had requested his extradition; thus Swedish prosecutors, unwilling to break diplomatic protocol, have deferred from interrogating Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador, London.

Hague confirmed the British Government&#x27;s position – that it is lawfully obliged to extradite Julian Assange. &quot;We&#x27;re disappointed by the statement by Ecuador&#x27;s Foreign Minister today that Ecuador has offered political asylum to Julian Assange. Under our Laws, with Mr. Assange having exhausted all options of appeal, the British authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to Sweden. We must carry out that obligation and of course we fully intend to do so,&quot; Hague confirmed.

Following &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper outcry over a Foreign Office note sanctioned by Hague sent to the Ecuadorian Embassy—in which it raised the possibility of the revocation of their diplomatic status under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987—the Foreign Secretary reaffirmed the UK remained &quot;committed to a diplomatic solution&quot; and played down any suggestion of a police raid of the Ecuadorian Embassy, stating &quot;there is no threat here to storm an embassy&quot;.

The former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, warned that using the 1987 Act to raid the Ecuadorian Embassy would be in &quot;breach of the Vienna Convention of 1961&quot;. Russia warned Britain against violating fundamental diplomatic principles (Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and in particular the Article 22 spelling out the inviolability of diplomatic premises), which the Government of Ecuador invoked.

Hague is the subject of a portrait in oil commissioned by Parliament.

===Leader of the House of Commons and retirement===
Once Hague had formally declared his intention not to seek re-election as MP for Richmond at the forthcoming 2015 general election, he told David Cameron he would be standing down as Foreign Secretary. Cameron instigated a Cabinet reshuffle whereby Hague became Leader of the House of Commons. Hague remained as Cameron&#x27;s &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; political deputy&quot;, retained his membership of the National Security Council and played a lead role in reaching out to voters in the North of England in the run up to the general election.

In a surprise motion on his last day in the House of Commons, Hague moved to make the election for Speaker in the next parliament a secret ballot, in what was seen as an effort to oust the incumbent John Bercow for lacking the neutrality expected of a Speaker of the House. Charles Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne, Chairman of the Procedure Committee and responsible for Speaker elections, stated that he had written a report about such an idea &quot;years ago&quot; and despite speaking with Hague and Michael Gove earlier that week, neither had told him of any such move. A visibly emotional Walker told the House, &quot;I have been played as a fool. When I go home tonight, I will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me. I would much rather be an honourable fool, in this and any other matter, than a clever man.&quot; Walker received a standing ovation, mainly from the Labour benches, while the Government lost its parliamentary motion by 228 to 202 votes. During the debate, Labour MP Gerald Kaufman denounced Hague, saying: &quot;Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that this grubby decision is what he personally will be remembered for? After a distinguished career in the House of Commons, both as a leader of a party and as a senior Cabinet Minister, he has now descended to squalor in the final days of the Parliament.&quot;

He was succeeded as MP for Richmond (Yorks) by future Chancellor of the Exchequer, future Prime Minister, and future Leader of the Opposition Rishi Sunak.

==In retirement==
On 9 October 2015, Hague was created Baron Hague of Richmond, &quot;of Richmond in the County of North Yorkshire&quot;.

In August 2020, Hague endorsed Joe Biden for US president over incumbent Donald Trump, arguing that a Biden victory was in the UK&#x27;s interest.

===Illegal wildlife trade fighter===
Hague and the then Duke of Cambridge identified, while the former was in post as Foreign Secretary, that the illegal wildlife trade (IWT) was among the most profitable criminal enterprises in the world, and in order to combat it formed in 2014 the Transport Task Force (TTF). The TTF seeks to identify and stop wildlife trafficking. They continue to work at this in 2020. The Financial Task Force was created in 2018 to help further the goal.

=== Royal Foundation ===
In September 2020, Hague was appointed as chairman of the Royal Foundation, a charitable organisation operating under the auspices of the then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in succession to Sir Keith Mills who retired.

=== Chancellor of the University of Oxford ===

In October 2024, Hague put himself forward as a candidate for Chancellor of Oxford University. He wrote in a 750 word statement: &quot;Oxford transformed my life. When I arrived as a 17-year-old from a comprehensive school for an interview at Magdalen, I didn’t know a single person in the whole city, and no one in my family had ever been to university. I have never forgotten how Oxford equipped me to take on any challenge in the world.&quot;

On 27 November 2024, the University announced that Hague had been elected Chancellor. He formally assumed the role in January 2025.

== Publications ==
Hague is an author of political biographies, and since his retirement from public life he has maintained a weekly column in first the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and subsequently &quot;The Times&quot;. Hague also writes the occasional book review and appears on TV shows and in radio presentations.

====On coronavirus====
Hague has been particularly sharp on the COVID-19 pandemic, writing as early as 10 February 2020 that &quot;Coronavirus is a calamity for China. It cannot continue its dangerous wildlife practices any longer.&quot; Hague wrote on 2 March that: &quot;The rise of coronavirus is a clear indication that the degrading of nature will come back to hit humans very hard.&quot; Hague returned to the subject on 13 April, when he said that the &quot;world must act now on wildlife markets or run the risk of worse pandemics in future&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hague married Ffion Jenkins at the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft on 19 December 1997. Ffion Hague is now styled The Lady Hague of Richmond.

Hague serves as a vice-president of the Friends of the British Library, which provides funding support for the British Library to make new acquisitions. He is a Patron of the European Youth Parliament UK, an educational charity organisation that runs debating competitions and discussion forums across the UK and is President of the Britain–Australia Society. Hague practises judo, and has a keen interest in music, learning to play the piano shortly after the 2001 general election. He is an enthusiast for the natural history and countryside of his native Yorkshire.

In 2015 Hague purchased a £2.5 million country house, Cyfronydd Hall, in Powys, Wales.

<doc id="161045" wikidata="Q3082835" url="?curid=161045" title="Economy of Timor-Leste">
<text>The economy of Timor-Leste is a low-income economy as ranked by the World Bank. It is placed 140th on the Human Development Index, indicating a medium level of human development. 20% of the population is unemployed, and 52.9% live on less than $1.25 a day. About half of the population is illiterate. At 27%, Timor-Leste&#x27;s urbanisation rate is one of the lowest in the world.

In 2007, a bad harvest caused a &quot;major food crisis&quot; in Timor-Leste. By November, eleven sub-districts still needed food supplied by international aid.

According to data gathered in the 2010 census, 87.7% of urban and 18.9% of rural households have electricity, for an overall average of 36.7%.

==History==
Prior to and during colonisation, the island of Timor was best known for its sandalwood. The Portuguese colonial administration also granted concessions to Oceanic Exploration Corporation to develop oil and gas deposits. However, this was curtailed by the Indonesian invasion in 1976.

Petrochemical resources were divided between Indonesia and Australia with the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989. The treaty established guidelines for joint exploitation of seabed resources in the area of the &quot;gap&quot; left by then-Portuguese Timor in the maritime boundary agreed between the two countries in 1972. Revenues from the &quot;joint&quot; area were to be divided 50-50. Woodside Petroleum and ConocoPhillips began development of some resources in the Timor Gap on behalf of the two governments in 1992.

In late 1999, about 70% of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was destroyed by Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias, and 260,000 people fled westward. From 2002 to 2005, an international program led by the United Nations, manned by civilian advisers, 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police officers, substantially reconstructed the infrastructure. By mid-2002, all but about 50,000 of the refugees had returned.

The economy grew by about 10% in 2011 and at a similar rate in 2012.

While Timor-Leste gained revenue from offshore oil and gas reserves, little of it has been spent on the development of villages, which still rely on subsistence farming. , nearly half the East Timorese population was living in extreme poverty.

== Data ==
==Industries==
In the Doing Business 2013 report by the World Bank, Timor-Leste was ranked 169th overall and last in the East Asia and Pacific region. The country fared particularly poorly in the &quot;registering property&quot;, &quot;enforcing contracts&quot;, and &quot;resolving insolvency&quot; categories, ranking last worldwide in all three. In 2020 it ranked 181st. There are no patent laws in Timor-Leste.

Regarding telecommunications infrastructure, Timor-Leste is the second to last ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Network Readiness Index (NRI), with only Myanmar falling behind it in Southeast Asia. In the 2014 NRI ranking, Timor-Leste ranked number 141 overall, down from 134 in 2013.

Timor-Leste is part of the Timor Leste–Indonesia–Australia Growth Triangle (TIA-GT).

===Agriculture===
The agriculture sector employs 80% of Timor-Leste&#x27;s active population. In 2009, about 67,000 households grew coffee in Timor-Leste, with a large proportion of those households being poor. Currently, the gross margins are about $120 per hectare, with returns per labour-day of about $3.70. There were 11,000 households growing mung beans as of 2009, most of them by subsistence farming. 94% of domestic fish catch comes from the ocean, especially coastal fisheries. 66% of families are in part supported by these subsistence activities, however the country as a whole does not produce enough food to be self-sustaining, and thus relies on imports. Coffee, rice, maize, coconuts, cassava, soybeans, bananas, mango, and sweet potatoes are cultivated here. With 5,014 Metric Tons in 2019, the country was ranked number 42 among other countries in Avocados Production.

After petroleum, the second largest export is coffee, which generates about $10 million a year. 9,000 tonnes of coffee, 108 tonnes of cinnamon, and 161 tonnes of cocoa were harvested in 2012 making the country the 40th ranked producer of coffee, the 6th ranked producer of cinnamon and the 50th ranked producer of cocoa worldwide. In 2019, 186 Metric Tons of cocoa beans were produced and the country was number 48.

===Energy===
====Oil and gas====
The Portuguese colonial administration granted concessions to the Australia-bound Oceanic Exploration Corporation to develop petroleum and natural gas deposits in the waters southeast of Timor. However, this was curtailed by the Indonesian invasion in 1976. The resources were divided between Indonesia and Australia with the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989. Timor-Leste inherited no permanent maritime boundaries when it attained independence. A provisional agreement (the Timor Sea Treaty, signed when Timor-Leste became independent on 20 May 2002) defined a Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) and awarded 90% of revenues from existing projects in that area to Timor-Leste and 10% to Australia. An agreement in 2005 between the governments of Timor-Leste and Australia mandated that both countries put aside their dispute over maritime boundaries and that Timor-Leste would receive 50% of the revenues from the resource exploitation in the area (estimated at A$26 billion, or about US$20 billion over the lifetime of the project) from the Greater Sunrise development. In 2013, Timor-Leste launched a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to pull out of a gas treaty that it had signed with Australia, accusing the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) of bugging the East Timorese cabinet room in Dili in 2004.

At the time of independence Timor-Leste had per capita natural wealth equivalent to the wealth of an upper-middle income country. Over half of this was in oil, and over a quarter natural gas. The Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was established in 2005 to turn these non-renewable resources into a more sustainable form of wealth. By 2009 it had a value of US$4.8 billion, and by 2011 it had reached a worth of US$8.7 billion. Timor-Leste is labelled by the International Monetary Fund as the &quot;most oil-dependent economy in the world&quot;. The Petroleum Fund pays for nearly all of the government&#x27;s annual budget, which increased from $70 million in 2004 to $1.3 billion in 2011, with a $1.8 billion proposal for 2012. East-Timor&#x27;s income from oil and gas stands to increase significantly after its cancellation of a controversial agreement with Australia, which gave Australia half of the income from oil and gas from 2006. From 2005 to 2021, $23 billion earned from oil sales has entered the fund. $8 billion has been generated from investments, while $12 billion has been spent. A decrease in oil and gas reserves led to decreasing HDI beginning in 2010. 80% of government spending comes from this fund, which as of 2021 had $19 billion, 10 times greater than the size of the national budget. As oil income has decreased, the fund is at risk of being exhausted. Withdrawals have exceeded sustainable levels almost every year since 2009.

====Electricity====
Electricidade De Timor-Leste (EDTL) is the vertically integrated monopoly generator and distributor of electric power within the on-grid areas.

===Tourism===
In 2017, the country was visited by 75,000 tourists. Since the later 2010s, tourism has been increasing and the number of hotels and resorts has increased. The government decided to invest in the expansion of the international airport in Dili.

===Oil and gas===

One promising long-term project is the joint development with Australia of petroleum and natural gas resources in the waters southeast of Timor-Leste.

Timor-Leste inherited no permanent maritime boundaries when it gained independence, repudiating the Timor Gap Treaty as illegal. A provisional agreement (the Timor Sea Treaty, signed when Timor-Leste became independent in 2002) defined a Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA), and awarded 90% of revenues from existing projects in that area to Timor-Leste and 10% to Australia. The first significant new development in the JPDA since East Timorese independence is the largest petroleum resource in the Timor Sea, the Greater Sunrise gas field. Its exploitation was the subject of separate agreements in 2003 and 2005. Only 20% of the field lies within the JPDA and the rest in waters not subject to the treaty (though claimed by both countries). The initial, temporary agreement gave 82% of revenues to Australia and only 18% to Timor-Leste.

The government of Timor-Leste has sought to negotiate a definite boundary with Australia at the halfway line between the countries, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The government of Australia preferred to establish the boundary at the end of the wide Australian continental shelf, as agreed with Indonesia in 1972 and 1991. Normally a dispute such as this would be referred to the International Court of Justice or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for an impartial decision, but the Australian government had withdrawn from these international jurisdictions (solely on matters relating to maritime boundaries) shortly before East Timorese independence.

Nevertheless, under public and diplomatic pressure, the Australian government offered instead a last-minute concession solely on royalties from the Greater Sunrise gas field. An agreement was signed in 2005 under which both countries would set aside the dispute over the maritime boundary, and Timor-Leste would receive 50% of the revenues (estimated at A$26 billion or about US$20 billion over the lifetime of the project) from the Greater Sunrise development. Other developments within waters claimed by Timor-Leste but outside the JPDA (Laminaria-Corallina and Buffalo) continue to be exploited unilaterally by Australia, however.

Some proceeds from Timor-Leste&#x27;s petroleum royalties are directed to the country&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund, the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund.

<text>Gopal Krishna Gokhale ( [ˈɡoːpaːl ˈkrɪʂɳə ˈɡoːkʰleː] 9 May 1866 – 19 February 1915) was an Indian political leader and a social reformer during the Indian independence movement, and political mentor of Indian freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi. 

Gokhale was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress and the founder of the Servants of India Society. Through the Society as well as the Congress and other legislative bodies he served in, Gokhale campaigned for Indian self-rule and for social reforms. He was the leader of the moderate faction of the Congress party that advocated reforms by working with existing government institutions, and a major member of the Poona Association or the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha.

==Early biography==
Gopal Krishna Gokhale hailed from a Marathi Hindu Brahmin family of Ratnagiri, Bombay Presidency, now Maharashtra.

He was born in a Chitpavan Brahmin family on 9 May 1866 of the British Raj in Kotluk village of Guhagar taluka in Ratnagiri district, in present-day Maharashtra (then part of the Bombay Presidency). Despite being relatively poor, his family members ensured that Gokhale received an English education, which would place Gokhale in a position to obtain employment as a clerk or minor official in the British Raj. He studied in Rajaram College in Kolhapur.
Being one of the first generations of Indians to receive a university education, under the guidance of Chakrappan, a great indian philosopher of that times, Gokhale graduated from Elphinstone College in 1884. He had a great influence of the social works of Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade on his life. He was named as the ‛Protege Son’ i.e. Manas Putra of Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade. Gokhale&#x27;s education tremendously influenced the course of his future career – in addition to learning English, he was exposed to Western political thought and became a great admirer of theorists such as John Stuart Mill and s Edmund Burke.

==Indian National Congress, Tilak and the Split at Surat==

Gokhale became a member of the Indian National Congress in 1889, as a protégé of social reformer Mahadev Govind Ranade. Along with other contemporary leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Dadabhai Naoroji, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai and Annie Besant, Gokhale fought for decades to obtain greater political representation and power over public affairs for common Indians. He was moderate in his views and attitudes, and sought to petition the British authorities by cultivating a process of dialogue and discussion which would yield greater British respect for Indian rights. Gokhale had visited Ireland and had arranged for an Irish nationalist, Alfred Webb, to serve as President of the Indian National Congress in 1894. The following year, Gokhale became the Congress&#x27;s joint secretary along with Tilak. In many ways, Tilak and Gokhale&#x27;s early careers paralleled –both attended Elphinstone College, both became mathematics professors and both were important members of the Deccan Education Society. However, differences in their views concerning how best to improve the lives of Indians became increasingly apparent.

Both Gokhale and Tilak were the front-ranking political leaders in the early 20th century. However, they differed a lot in their ideologies. Gokhale was viewed as a well-meaning man of moderate disposition, while Tilak was a radical who would not resist using force for the attainment of freedom. Gokhale believed that the right course for India to get self-government was to adopt constitutional means and cooperate with the British Government. On the contrary, Tilak&#x27;s messages were protest, boycott and agitation.

The fight between the moderates and extremists came out openly at Surat in 1907, which adversely affected political developments in the country. Both sides were fighting to capture the Congress organisation due to ideological differences. Tilak wanted to put Lala Lajpat Rai in the presidential chair, but Gokhale&#x27;s candidate was Rash Behari Ghosh. The tussle begun and there was no hope for compromise. Tilak was not allowed to move an amendment to the resolution in support of the new president-elect. At this the pandal was strewn with broken chairs and shoes were flung by Aurobindo Ghosh and his friends. Sticks and umbrellas were thrown on the platform. There was a physical scuffle. When people came running to attack Tilak on the dais, Gokhale went and stood next to Tilak to protect him. The session ended and the Congress split. The eyewitness account was written by the Manchester Guardian&#x27;s reporter Nevison.

In January 1908, Tilak was arrested on charge of sedition and sentenced to six years imprisonment and dispatched to Mandalay. This left the whole political field open for the moderates. When Tilak was arrested, Gokhale was in England. Lord Morley, the Secretary of State for India, was opposed to Tilak&#x27;s arrest. However, the Viceroy Lord Minto did not listen to him and considered Tilak&#x27;s activities as seditious and his arrest necessary for the maintenance of law and order.

Gokhale&#x27;s one major difference with Tilak centred around one of his pet issues, the Age of Consent Bill introduced by the British Imperial Government, in 1891–92. Gokhale and his fellow liberal reformers, wishing to purge what they saw as superstitions and abuses in their native Hinduism, supported the Consent Bill to curb child marriage abuses. Though the Bill was not extreme, only raising the age of consent from ten to twelve, Tilak took issue with it; he did not object to the idea of moving towards the elimination of child marriage, but rather to the idea of British interference with Hindu tradition. For Tilak, such reform movements were not to be sought under imperial rule when they would be enforced by the British, but rather after independence was achieved, when Indians would enforce it on themselves. The bill however became law in the Bombay Presidency. The two leaders also vied for the control of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha and the founding of the Deccan Sabha by Gokhale in 1896 was the consequence of Tilak coming out ahead.

Gokhale was deeply concerned with the future of Congress after the split in Surat. He thought it necessary to unite the rival groups, and in this connection he sought the advice of Annie Besant. Gokhale died on 19 February 1915. On his deathbed, he reportedly expressed to his friend S. S. Setlur a wish to see the Congress united. Despite their differences, Gokhale and Tilak had great respect for each other&#x27;s patriotism, intelligence, work and sacrifice. Following Gokhale&#x27;s death, Tilak wrote an editorial in Kesari paying glowing tributes to Gokhale.

== Economist with liberal policy ==
Gokhale&#x27;s mentor, justice M.G. Ranade started the Sarvajanik Sabha Journal. Gokhale assisted him. Gokhale&#x27;s deposition before the Welby Commission on the financial condition of India won him accolades. His speeches on the budget in the Central Legislative Council were unique, with thorough statistical analysis. He appealed to the reason. He played a leading role in bringing about Morley-Minto Reforms, the beginning of constitutional reforms in India. A comprehensive biography of Gopal Krishna Gokhale by Govind Talwalkar portrays Gokhale&#x27;s work in the context of his time, giving the historical background in the 19th century. Gokhale was a scholar, social reformer, and a statesman, arguably the greatest Indian liberal. VG Kale has provided an account of the economic reforms pursued by Gokhale in the Vicerory&#x27;s Legislative Council and outside till 1916.

==Servants of India society==

In 1905, when Gokhale was elected president of the Indian National Congress and was at the height of his political power, he founded the Servants of India Society to specifically further one of the causes dearest to his heart: the expansion of Indian education. For Gokhale, true political change in India would only be possible when a new generation of Indians became educated as to their civil and patriotic duty to their country and to each other. Believing existing educational institutions and the Indian Civil Service did not do enough to provide Indians with opportunities to gain this political education, Gokhale hoped the Servants of India Society would fill this need. In his preamble to the SIS&#x27;s constitution, Gokhale wrote that &quot;The Servants of India Society will train men prepared to devote their lives to the cause of country in a religious spirit, and will seek to promote, by all constitutional means, the national interests of the Indian people.&quot; The Society took up the cause of promoting Indian education in earnest, and among its many projects organised mobile libraries, founded schools, and provided night classes for factory workers. Although the Society lost much of its vigour following Gokhale&#x27;s death, it still exists to this day, though its membership is small.

==Involvement with British Imperial Government==

Gokhale, though now widely viewed as a leader of the Indian nationalist movement, was not primarily concerned with independence but rather with social reforms; he believed such reforms would be best achieved by working within existing British government institutions, a position which earned him the enmity of more aggressive nationalists such as Tilak. Undeterred by such opposition, Gokhale would work directly with the British throughout his political career to further his reform goals.

In 1899, Gokhale was elected to the Bombay Legislative Council. He was elected to the Imperial Council of the Governor-General of India on 20 December 1901, and again on 22 May 1903 as non-officiating member representing Bombay Province.

The empirical knowledge coupled with the experience of the representative institutions made Gokhale an outstanding political leader, moderate in ideology and advocacy, a model for the people&#x27;s representatives. His contribution was monumental in shaping the Indian freedom struggle into a quest for building an open society and egalitarian nation. Gokhale&#x27;s achievement must be studied in the context of predominant ideologies and social, economic and political situation at that time, particularly in reference to the famines, revenue policies, wars, partition of Bengal, Muslim League and the split in the Congress at Surat.

== Campaigning against Indenture ==
Gokhale was a prominent opponent to the use of Indian indentured labour in Africa and the British empire more broadly. In 1908, Gandhi and finance minister J.C. Smuts agreed that compulsory registration would be withdrawn and Indians should be offered the opportunity to register themselves. However, J.C. Smuts broke his promise. Gandhi requested people to burn their registrations. 

Gokhale used this situation to promote his cause against indentured labour. Gokhale proclaimed several key arguments during his campaign. Firstly, the contract was not fair, due to the unequal nature of its construction. Furthermore, the Indentured labour were inadequately protected by the Magistrates and Protectors due to their suspected hostility towards the plantation workers. Gokhale also aimed to highlight the sufferings endured by indentured slaves. Gokhale witnessed a mounting number of suicides which resulted from the system, &quot;innocent people preferring death with their own hands to life under it&quot;, &quot;were a ghastly feature of indenture&quot;. Gokhale also raised an issue surrounding the expected number of women being forced into indenture. With every 100 men, 40 women must be also assigned. He argued that good-hearted women were reluctant to participate in the system. Thus, the colony was forcing undeserving immoral women to participate to meet this criterion. Finally, the system in itself was regarding to the people of Indian from the national point of view.

In 1910, Gokhale successfully brought an end to indentured migration in Natal. He did this by presenting a resolution in the Imperial Legislative Council discussing the issue. In 1910 Gokhale moved a Resolution for the Prohibition of Indentured Labour altogether in 1912. Although this resolution did not succeed Gokhale&#x27;s preaching and actions had a significant influence on the eventual end to indentured labour in 1920. In addition to his oppositionist activism, Gokhale had also drwan the attention of British sympathisers within India. In 1904, missionary and activist Charles Andrews was shocked by the racism he found in British India. Therefore, Andrews sought a friendship with Gokhale, as he was a social reformer and nationalist. Through his connection to Gokhale, Andrews became aware of the maltreatment and exploitation suffered by Indian indentured labours across the British Empire. In 1914, Gokhale convinced Andrews to travel to South Africa to witness these issues first-hand. It was during this time in Africa when Andrews built friendship with Gandhi.

== Mentor to Gandhi ==

Gokhale was famously a mentor to Mahatma Gandhi in the latter&#x27;s formative years. In 1912, Gokhale visited South Africa at Gandhi&#x27;s invitation. As a young barrister, Gandhi returned from his struggles against the Empire in South Africa and received personal guidance from Gokhale, including a knowledge and understanding of India and the issues confronting common Indians. By 1920, Gandhi emerged as the leader of the Indian Independence Movement. In his autobiography, Gandhi calls Gokhale his mentor and guide. Gandhi also recognised Gokhale as an admirable leader and master politician, describing him as &quot;pure as crystal, gentle as a lamb, brave as a lion and chivalrous to a fault and the most perfect man in the political field&quot;. Despite his deep respect for Gokhale, however, Gandhi would reject Gokhale&#x27;s faith in western institutions as a means of achieving political reform and ultimately chose not to become a member of Gokhale&#x27;s Servants of India Society.

== Family ==
Gokhale married twice. His first marriage took place in 1880 when he was in his teens to Savitribai, who suffered from an incurable ailment. He married a second time in 1887 to Rishibama while Savitribai was still alive. His second wife died after giving birth to two daughters in 1899. Gokhale did not marry again and his children were looked after by his relatives.

His eldest daughter, Kashi (Anandibai), married Justice S.B. Dhavle ICS. She had three children – Gopal Shankar Dhavle, Balwant Shankar Dhavle and Meena Rajwade. Out of these three children, two of them had children. Balwant Shankar Dhavle and Nalini Dhavle (née Sathe) have three children: Shridhar Balwant Dhavle FCA, Vidyadhar Balwant Dhavle IFS and Jyotsna Balwant Dhavle. Vidyadhar Balwant Dhavle and Aabha Dixit have two sons Abhishek Vidyadhar Dhavle and Jaidev Vidyadhar Dhavle, who are the most recent direct descendants of Gopal Krishna Gokhale. The ancestral house was constructed by Gopal Krishna Gokhale for his family in Pune, and it continues to be the residence of the Gokhale-Dhavle descendants to this day. Also, the native village of G.K Gokhale, Tamhanmala, a remote village in Ratnagiri, has his paternal house even today. It is located 25 km away from Chiplun, Ratnagiri. Other paternal relatives of Gokhale still reside at the same.

*1962 in jazz

==Events==
*January 1 – The Beatles and Brian Poole and the Tremeloes both audition at Decca Records in London. Decca has the option of signing one group only. The Beatles are rejected, perhaps because they come from Liverpool and the others are Dagenham-based, nearer London.
*January 5 – The first album on which The Beatles play, &quot;My Bonnie&quot;, as backing to Tony Sheridan (recorded the previous June in Hamburg and produced by Bert Kaempfert), is released by Polydor.
*January 24 – Brian Epstein signs a contract to manage The Beatles.
*February 16 – Conductor Bruno Walter, the day before his death, ends his last letter with: &quot;Despite all the dark experiences of today I am still confident that &quot;Palestrina&quot; will remain. The work has all the elements of immortality&quot;.
