<text>Godsmack is an American rock band from Lawrence, Massachusetts, formed in 1995. The band is composed of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Sully Erna, bassist Robbie Merrill, lead guitarist Tony Rombola and drummer Shannon Larkin. Since its formation, Godsmack has released eight studio albums, one EP (&quot;The Other Side&quot;), four DVDs, one compilation album (&quot;Good Times, Bad Times... Ten Years of Godsmack&quot;), and one live album (&quot;Live &amp; Inspired&quot;).

The band has released three consecutive number-one albums (&quot;Faceless&quot;, &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;The Oracle&quot;) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band also has 25 top ten rock radio hits, including 18 songs in the top five, and 12 at #1. The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;When Legends Rise&quot; was released on April 27, 2018. Their eighth and final album &quot;Lighting Up the Sky&quot; was released on February 24, 2023.

Since its inception, Godsmack has toured with Ozzfest on more than one occasion and has toured with many other large tours and festivals, including supporting its albums with its own arena tours. In honor of the band&#x27;s success and the release of their sixth studio album, &quot;1000hp&quot;, Mayor Marty Walsh declared August 6 as &quot;Godsmack Day&quot; in the city of Boston.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;All Wound Up...&quot; (1995–1997)===
In February 1995, Sully Erna decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including more than two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind. His new band, The Scam, formed with Erna on vocals, Robbie Merrill on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and Tommy Stewart on drums. The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo. The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometown of Boston. Locally popular songs such as &quot;Keep Away&quot; and &quot;Whatever&quot; soon brought them to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.

Many people think the band&#x27;s name stemmed from the Alice in Chains song of the same name, but according to Erna, the band&#x27;s name came from a small and personal incident. &quot;I was making fun of [our drummer at the time] who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, &#x27;It&#x27;s a god smack.&#x27; The name stuck. We were aware of the Alice In Chains song but didn&#x27;t really think much about it.&quot; In 1996, Tony Rombola joined as the guitarist after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered New Alliance Studio in Boston to record its debut album, &quot;All Wound Up...&quot;. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600 and was self-released in February 1997 through the band&#x27;s own record label, E. K. Records Company. In May 1997, Joe D&#x27;Arco joined to replace Stewart on drums.

Eventually, Godsmack&#x27;s CD landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put &quot;Keep Away&quot; into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of &quot;Keep Away&quot;, Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled &quot;Whatever&quot;, which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, &quot;We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off.&quot; In April 1998, D&#x27;Arco was dismissed from the band. He was replaced by former drummer Tommy Stewart, who returned after expressing a desire to be in the band again.

===&quot;Godsmack&quot; (1998–1999)===
In June 1998, Universal/Republic Records signed the band to their label. The band&#x27;s first album &quot;All Wound Up...&quot; was slightly edited to remove unlicensed samples, fully re-mastered and given a new artwork and layout; the finished self-titled album &quot;Godsmack&quot; was released to the public six weeks later on August 25, 1998. This led to the band&#x27;s first headlining tour, &quot;The Godsmack Tour&quot; with Jim Rose Circus as the opening act. After the album&#x27;s release the band went on the road playing club shows as well as playing at Ozzfest and Woodstock &#x27;99. This was followed by a tour in Europe supporting Black Sabbath. Roxanne Blanford from Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, stating, &quot;Godsmack confidently brought metal into the technological age&quot;. The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number twenty-two, and was certified 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2024 after being initially certified gold in 1999.

The album sold well despite being initially pulled from the shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its lyrical content. The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine stating, &quot;Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint ... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective ... We have decided to put a sticker on the record.&quot; This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped; &quot;It&#x27;s almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we&#x27;re saying on it.&quot; The album also had four successful singles which were &quot;Whatever&quot;, &quot;Keep Away&quot;, &quot;Voodoo&quot; and &quot;Bad Religion&quot;.

===&quot;Awake&quot; (2000–2001)===

In 2000, Godsmack returned to the studio after the multi-platinum success of &quot;Godsmack&quot; to start recording &quot;Awake&quot;. The album was released on , 2000. The album debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and has been certified 2× platinum by the RIAA. &quot;Vampires&quot;, a song on the album, also earned the band a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2002. With the release of &quot;Awake&quot;, Godsmack toured Europe supporting Limp Bizkit. Erna said at the time, &quot;We&#x27;ve been touring nonstop since August 1998, So most of &quot;Awake&quot; was written on tour while we were ping-ponging between America and Europe, building up the band. &quot;Ozzfest&quot; was actually the only big tour where we rode under someone else&#x27;s wings; we did a lot of work on our own.&quot; The band played Ozzfest in 2000 again as they had in 1999. On July 19, 2001, Godsmack released their first live DVD titled &quot;Live&quot;. The DVD has since been certified Gold by the RIAA for selling 50,000 copies in the United States.

Two of the songs on the album were used in United States Navy commercials (&quot;Sick of Life&quot; and &quot;Awake&quot;) as background music. Erna stated, &quot;Someone in the military is a fan, and they asked if they could use the music, and we accepted&quot;. However, Erna insisted in an interview that Godsmack does not support any war.

===&quot;The Scorpion King&quot;, &quot;Faceless&quot; and &quot;The Other Side&quot; (2002–2004)===
In 2002, Erna was asked to write and perform a song for the soundtrack to &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;. The song Godsmack wrote and performed was titled &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; and the song became the number 1 single at Rock Radio and the most played Active Rock song in 2002 for 14 weeks straight. It was also used in the game &quot;Prince of Persia: Warrior Within&quot;.

With Shannon Larkin (ex Ugly Kid Joe, Souls at Zero, Wrathchild America, MF Pitbulls) replacing Tommy Stewart, who left due to personal differences for the second time, Godsmack went back into the studio later that year to record a new album that was released in 2003. &quot;Faceless&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 269,000 copies in its first week, and the album would go on to sell over one million copies in the United States. &quot;Faceless&quot; also debuted at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums and at number one on the Top Internet Albums and remained at that position for two weeks. A massive Tour of America and Europe supporting Metallica followed.

The lead single &quot;Straight Out of Line&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Hard Rock Performance&quot;. The award went to Evanescence&#x27;s single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;. The album got its name after a swimming-pool incident. However, in a later interview Merrill stated otherwise, making it unclear of how the album&#x27;s title came to be, &quot;It came from the band&#x27;s feeling that, despite our radio and sales success, we still flew a bit under the radar&quot;.

On March 16, 2004 &quot;The Other Side&quot;, an acoustic EP, was released. The album debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, a relatively high position for an acoustic EP. It included several previously released songs re-recorded as acoustic versions, as well as three new acoustic tracks. One new song, &quot;Touché&quot;, featured Godsmack&#x27;s first guitar player, Lee Richards, as well as John Kosco, who were at that time in the now defunct band Dropbox, The other two new acoustic tracks were &quot;Running Blind&quot; and &quot;Voices&quot;. The song &quot;Asleep&quot; is actually an acoustic version of &quot;Awake&quot; from the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Awake&quot;. Godsmack shifted from its &quot;heavy&quot; sound to a more mellow acoustic sound on this EP in the same manner Alice in Chains did in the &quot;Sap&quot; and &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; EPs, one of many similarities to Alice in Chains for which the band has been criticized.

In 2004, Godsmack opened for Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Madly in Anger with the World tour&quot;, and headlined the tour along with Dropbox. Afterwards, in autumn 2004, the band played several acoustic shows to promote &quot;The Other Side&quot;, while at the same time continuing to open for Metallica.

===&quot;IV&quot; and &quot;Ten Years of Godsmack&quot; (2006–2008)===
Throughout 2006, The band was in the studio recording and writing material for a new album. On April 25, 2006, Godsmack released its fourth studio album simply titled &quot;IV&quot;, followed by a tour that would continue until January 2008, titled &quot;The IV tour&quot;. The album was produced by Erna and engineered by the well known producer and engineer Andy Johns, known for engineering Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Speak&quot; was released on , 2006. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 211,000 copies in its first week.

&quot;IV&quot; has since been certified gold. The band had written over forty songs for the album, but the final track listing had eleven tracks, Larkin commented, &quot;it&#x27;s Sully&#x27;s band and his vision.[...]When it comes time to pick the songs it&#x27;s all Sully&quot;. The album&#x27;s minimalist name &quot;IV&quot; derives not only from its being the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, but also from a running piece of backstage humor, as related by Larkin and Erna in an interview.

To celebrate ten years as a band, Godsmack released a greatest hits album entitled &quot;Good Times, Bad Times... Ten Years of Godsmack&quot; on , 2007. The album debuted at number thirty-five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 40,000 copies in the first week of release. It includes a cover of the Led Zeppelin song &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot;, as well as a DVD of Godsmack&#x27;s acoustic performance in Las Vegas at House of Blues. The album was originally intended to be a boxed set, but the band scrapped the plans so they could release a best of album. Godsmack will follow the release of the album with an acoustic tour. Despite rumors of the band going on hiatus as a result of releasing a greatest hits album, Erna was quoted as saying, &quot;we&#x27;re not going away, we are just gonna take a break and enjoy our 10th year anniversary and kind of recharge our batteries. And then Godsmack will be back, and we will come back bigger and badder than ever.&quot;

===&quot;The Oracle&quot; and break (2008–2013)===
In November 2008, Larkin announced that the band would be reforming and recording a new album. The following summer, the band toured as support to Mötley Crüe&#x27;s Crüe Fest 2 tour and released a non-album single, &quot;Whiskey Hangover&quot;. After the tour, Godsmack started production for their new album. The album, titled &quot;The Oracle&quot; was released on , 2010. Arriving to popular reception, &quot;The Oracle&quot; was Godsmack&#x27;s third straight full-length studio album to debut at No. 1 with 117,000 sold in the first week of release. Erna had this to say about the early sound album, &quot;It&#x27;s gonna be really heavy. I mean, it&#x27;s very aggressive. I&#x27;m not really sure; it&#x27;s very premature right now. Right now we just finished one track for the Crüe Fest this Summer. But as far as the whole record goes, I think it&#x27;s going to be a lot more in your face. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s going to be any &#x27;Voodoo&#x27;s or &#x27;Serenity&#x27;s on this one. We decided to go balls out!&quot;.

Godsmack headlined the fourth annual Mayhem Festival alongside Disturbed. The band entered the studio in January 2012 to mix a live album plus record several covers for an upcoming release. They then went on tour in the spring with Staind. In February 2012, Godsmack finished an EP of cover songs. Godsmack released their new live album &quot;Live &amp; Inspired&quot; on May 15, 2012. The set included a bonus EP of cover tracks. In December of the same year, Sully said in an interview that Godsmack would take a break during 2013, stating &quot;We&#x27;re going to take some time away now because we just ran for the last two years.&quot; A month after, Erna announced a short solo tour through America.

===&quot;1000hp&quot; (2014–2016)===

In February 2014, Erna tweeted that the band had made progress in the songwriting process for its next studio album, tentatively scheduled for a late 2014 release. He also mentioned that the band finished 11 songs for the new record in two weeks. In April, the band announced that they had recorded 15 songs, ten of which would make the final cut. In May, Erna announced that the album would be titled &quot;1000hp&quot; (1000 Horsepower). The album&#x27;s title track was released as a single the following month. The album was released on August 5, 2014, and sold around 58,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 3 on The Billboard 200 chart. Since release the album has spawned the singles &quot;Something Different&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Next&quot;. The band have unified a campaign to aid military veterans with their latest single &quot;What&#x27;s Next&quot;.

Godsmack also headlined the 2014 Uproar Festival. They were announced on August 20, 2014, to be part of the Soundwave Festival in Australia. In July 2015, the band revealed dates for an upcoming North American fall headline tour. The run included dates with Sevendust. Also in August 2015 Godsmack announced a new leg of North American dates that would keep the band busy through mid-November.

On September 9, 2016, Erna confirmed that the band had officially left Universal/Republic, and signed a deal with BMG.

===&quot;When Legends Rise&quot; (2017–2020)===
The band began work on a seventh studio album in 2017. The album, &quot;When Legends Rise&quot;, was released on April 27, 2018. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Bulletproof&quot;, was released ahead of the album on February 28, 2018. The band toured across North America from May through October 2018. They played at several festivals before embarking on a co-headlining summer tour with Shinedown. The band then toured Europe in October and November 2018 in support of their new album. However, On October 17, 2018, it was announced that the band postponed their fall 2018 Europe tour, following death of Tony Rombola&#x27;s son and plan to reschedule in early 2019.

On July 25, 2019, the song &quot;Under Your Scars&quot; hit number 1 for two weeks for the first time on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Songs chart.

On April 8, 2020, the band released a music video for the song &quot;Unforgettable&quot;. The band invited 400 aspiring musicians from middle school students across New England to take part in the video. The video, directed by Noah Berlow, again sent the song to the top of the charts for five weeks, setting a new record most constitutive at number 1 in its category.

===&quot;Lighting Up the Sky&quot; (2021–present)===

News of a follow-up to the album began circulating as early as August 2019 when frontman Sully Erna revealed in an interview with Canada&#x27;s iHeartRadio that the band has been preparing to begin the songwriting process for the album.

It was later revealed that Godsmack would be working on two new releases for 2021: an acoustic EP and a full length album. That plan has since been scrapped with Sully admitting that the band was being &quot;a little bit more ambitious&quot; at the time.

With just one album to focus on, Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said on &quot;The Metal Teddy Bear Experience&quot; podcast that the band intended for the album to be released in 2022. In an April 23, 2022, interview with WJRR, frontman Sully Erna said that the band has finished recording the new album with a new single expected to hit the airwaves in mid-to-late summer and that the album could be the band&#x27;s last.

On September 28, 2022, the band released the single titled &quot;Surrender&quot;. Shortly after the release of the new single, Sully Erna revealed in an interview with 93X Radio&#x27;s Pablo that the title of the album would be &quot;Lighting Up the Sky&quot; and that it would indeed be the band&#x27;s last record. A second single for the album &quot;You and I&quot; was released on November 11, 2022. The album was released on February 24, 2023.

==Musical style and influences==
Godsmack has been described as post-grunge, hard rock, nu metal, alternative metal, and heavy metal. The band&#x27;s primary influences include Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Pantera and Rush according to Erna, Larkin, and Rombola. Erna says Layne Staley is his primary influence as a vocalist.

The overall sound of the band&#x27;s first two albums have been compared to Alice in Chains&#x27; album &quot;Dirt&quot;. However, Godsmack has attempted to distance themselves from the Alice in Chains comparison with Erna stating in an interview with Matt Ashare, &quot;I&#x27;ve just never really heard that in our music.&quot;

The band&#x27;s music is often compared to Alice in Chains which the band cites as an influence. Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; states, &quot;Erna perfectly mimics the late Layne Staley&#x27;s low, guttural, sinister singing and snarly, metal-inspired growls&quot; and, &quot;The band&#x27;s music is a faithful retread of Jerry Cantrell&#x27;s churning, tuned-down hard rock&quot;.

Erna&#x27;s singing style has been stated as &quot;the snarl of James Hetfield&quot;, and &quot;composed of dark harmony that sounds a lot like Alice in Chains&quot;. Merrill&#x27;s bass style has been described as &quot;bulldozer bottom with occasional slap-bass reverb&quot;. Larkin&#x27;s drumming is thought to &quot;worship at the twin altars of Neil Peart and John Bonham&quot;. And Rombola&#x27;s guitar playing style has been praised as &quot;guitars that sound like percussion instruments&quot;.

<text>Gladys Maria Knight (born May 28, 1944) is an American singer. Knight recorded hits through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s with her family group Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, which included her brother Merald &quot;Bubba&quot; Knight and cousins William Guest and Edward Patten. She has won seven Grammy Awards (four as a solo artist and three with the Pips), and is often referred to as the &quot;Empress of Soul&quot;.

Knight has recorded two number-one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles (&quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; which she did with Dionne Warwick, Sir Elton John and Stevie Wonder), eleven number-one R&amp;B singles and six number-one R&amp;B albums. In 1989, Knight recorded the theme song for the James Bond film &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;. 
Two of her songs (&quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; and &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot;) were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant&quot; value. She is an inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Vocal Group Hall of Fame along with The Pips. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Knight among the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time (2010). She is also a recipient of the National Medal of Arts and Kennedy Center Honors.

==Early life==
Gladys Knight was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 28, 1944, to Sarah Elizabeth (née Woods), a nurse&#x27;s aide, and Merald Woodlow Knight Sr., a postal worker. Her parents were members of both the church choir and a local choir group. She has a sister, Brenda, and two brothers, Merald &quot;Bubba&quot; Jr. and David &quot;Billy&quot;.

Knight was raised Baptist and began singing gospel music at age four at the Mount Moriah Baptist Church in Atlanta. At the age of eight, she won Ted Mack&#x27;s &quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot; TV show contest singing Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Too Young.&quot; Shortly after, Knight along with her brother Bubba, sister Brenda, and cousins Eleanor and William Guest performed together during Bubba&#x27;s tenth birthday party after a record player malfunctioned. The quintet later formed a group at the encouragement of Knight&#x27;s mother. The group settled on the name &quot;The Pips&quot;, inspired by the nickname of their cousin and manager, James &quot;Pip&quot; Woods. 

The Pips performed at church, talent shows, and clubs opening for popular acts, then signed with Brunswick Records in 1957 and began releasing singles. After a few lineup changes, the group debuted their first album in 1960 when Knight was just 16. By then, she had recorded five songs and released her first hit single, “Every Beat of My Heart.” The group&#x27;s success was later halted by Knight&#x27;s departure to start a family with husband and musician Jimmy Newman, resuming soon after when she returned.

Knight attended the historic Booker T. Washington High School, in Atlanta, later transferring and graduating from Archer High School.

==Success with the Pips==
Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips joined the Motown Records roster in 1966 (with only three hits to their credit - &quot;Every Beat of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Giving Up&quot; and &quot;Letter Full of Tears&quot;), and, although initially regarded as a second-string act by the label, scored several major hit singles, including &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; (#1 in 1967) (released later by Marvin Gaye), &quot;The Nitty Gritty&quot; (1969), &quot;Friendship Train&quot; (1969), &quot;If I Were Your Woman&quot; (1970), &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Do Wrong&quot; (1971), the Grammy Award–winning &quot;Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)&quot; (1972), and &quot;Daddy Could Swear (I Declare)&quot; (1973). In their early Motown career, Gladys Knight and the Pips toured as the opening act for Diana Ross and the Supremes. Gladys Knight stated in her memoirs that Ross kicked her off the tour because the audience&#x27;s reception to Knight&#x27;s soulful performance overshadowed her. Berry Gordy later told Knight that she was giving his act a hard time.

The act left Motown for a better deal with Buddah Records in 1973, and achieved even greater mainstream success that year with hits such as the Grammy-winning &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; (#1 on the pop and R&amp;B chart), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got to Use My Imagination&quot;, &quot;The Way We Were/Try To Remember&quot; and &quot;Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me&quot;. In the summer of 1974, Knight and the Pips recorded the soundtrack to the film &quot;Claudine&quot; with producer Curtis Mayfield, which included the songs &quot;On and On&quot;, &quot;The Makings of You&quot; and &quot;Make Yours a Happy Home&quot;. 

The act was particularly successful in Europe, and especially the United Kingdom. A number of the Buddah singles became hits in the UK several years after their release in the US. For example, &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; hit the Top 5 of the UK singles chart in the summer of 1976, a full three years after its success in the U.S.

Knight and the Pips continued to have hits until the late 1970s, when they were forced to record separately due to legal issues, resulting in Knight&#x27;s first solo LP recordings—&quot;Miss Gladys Knight&quot; (1978) on Buddah and &quot;Gladys Knight&quot; (1979) on Columbia Records. After divorcing James Newman II in 1973, Knight married Barry Hankerson, then Detroit mayor Coleman Young&#x27;s executive aide. Knight and Hankerson remained married for four years, during which time they had a son, Shanga Ali. Hankerson and Knight became embroiled in a heated custody battle over Shanga Ali. In 1980, Johnny Mathis invited Knight to record two duets— &quot;When A Child Is Born&quot; (previously a hit for Mathis) and &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;.
Signing with Columbia Records in 1980 and restored to its familiar quartet form, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips began releasing new material. The act enlisted former Motown producers Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson for their first two albums: &quot;About Love&quot; (1980), which included the hit &quot;Landlord&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot; (1981).

In 1983, Gladys Knight and the Pips scored again with the hit &quot;Save the Overtime (For Me)&quot;. The song, under the artistic direction of Leon Sylvers III (known for collaborating on Shalamar hits), was done in a soulful boogie style. The single was released from their LP &quot;Visions&quot; and reached number sixty-six on the Hot 100, but was more successful on the R&amp;B where it hit number one for a single week in mid 1983. The single was the first time the group hit number one on the R&amp;B chart since 1974. The video accompanying the song became among the earliest R&amp;B videos to incorporate elements of hip hop culture. The album also included the R&amp;B hit &quot;You&#x27;re Number One (In My Book)&quot;. 

In 1987, Knight decided to pursue a solo career, and she and the Pips recorded their final LP together, &quot;All Our Love&quot; (1987), for MCA Records. Its infectious lead single, &quot;Love Overboard&quot;, was a number-one R&amp;B hit and won another Grammy for the act as well. After a successful 1988 tour, the Pips retired and Knight began her solo career. Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips were inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1989, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Solo career and other musical endeavors==
While still with the Pips, Gladys Knight joined with Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, and Elton John on the 1985 AIDS benefit single, &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;, a triple No. 1 mega-hit, which won a Grammy for Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal.

Knight shared a stage with Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle for the 1986 HBO special &quot;Sisters in the Name of Love,&quot; which she co-executive produced and received three ACE Awards for Performance in a Music Special, as well as nominations for Best Music Special and Costume Design in 1987. On March 27, 1988, Knight performed a rendition of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at Wrestlemania 4 in Atlantic City, NJ. In 1989, she recorded &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, the title track for James Bond film of the same name, a Top-10 hit in the UK and Germany.

Knight released her third and most successful solo LP, &quot;Good Woman&quot;, on MCA in 1991, which hit No. 1 on the R&amp;B album chart, featured the No. 2 R&amp;B hit &quot;Men&quot;, and reached No. 45 on the main &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart—her all-time-highest showing. The album also featured &quot;Superwoman&quot;, written by Babyface and featuring Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle; the track was nominated for a Grammy. Knight and LaBelle collaborated the same year on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Do Duets&quot;, for LaBelle&#x27;s album &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot;. Also in 1991, Knight performed the national anthem at Game 1 of the World Series.

Her fourth solo album, &quot;Just for You&quot;, went Gold and was nominated for the 1995 Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album. The fifth solo album, &quot;At Last&quot;, earned her first solo Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&amp;B Album in 2000.

Knight created and directs the Mormon-themed choir Saints Unified Voices. SUV has released a Grammy Award-winning CD titled &quot;One Voice&quot;, and occasionally performs at LDS church firesides.
In April 2004, Knight co-headlined the VH1&#x27;s benefit concert &quot;Divas Live 2004&quot; alongside Ashanti, Cyndi Lauper, Jessica Simpson, Joss Stone, Debbie Harry, and Patti LaBelle, in support of the Save the Music Foundation.

In 2005, a duet between Knight and Ray Charles of &quot;You Were There&quot; was released on Charles&#x27; duets album &quot;Genius &amp; Friends&quot;.

In the spring of 2008, Knight appeared alongside Chaka Khan, Patti LaBelle and Diana Ross at the &#x27;Divas with Heart&#x27; concert in aid of cardiac research, at New York&#x27;s Radio City Hall. Also in 2008 Gladys, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Stiller performed on &quot;American Idol&quot; to raise money for charity.

In 2009, Knight sang &quot;His Eye Is On The Sparrow&quot; and &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; at the funeral service for Michael Jackson.

In September 2011, a new, updated recording of Shirley Bassey&#x27;s 1960s classic &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot; was released on iTunes and Amazon.

In 2013, Knight recorded the Lenny Kravitz-written and -produced song &quot;You And I Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; No More&quot; for the soundtrack from Lee Daniels&#x27; motion picture &quot;The Butler&quot;. The song was added to the movie&#x27;s soundtrack of older songs with various artists so the producers could nominate it for Best Song from a Motion Picture category at the Academy Awards.
&quot;Where My Heart Belongs&quot; (2014) marked her 30th top-40 R&amp;B album, including work by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. In a 2014 interview, she expressed a hope that women would &quot;Stand Up&quot; and stop selling sex in the music/entertainment industry. She commented that the growing trend saddened her heart and that she had been taught to dress respectfully for her audiences ... &quot;not take it off, put it on.&quot; Knight is ranked number 18 on VH1 network&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Women of Rock.

In 2019, Knight accepted an invitation to sing the national anthem at Super Bowl LIII. She faced criticism for agreeing to perform due to the alleged blacklisting of Colin Kaepernick by the National Football League after he began protesting police brutality during pre-game anthem ceremonies. Similar criticism was expressed against the half-time show performers, Maroon 5, Travis Scott, and Big Boi. Knight defended her decision to sing, claiming to understand Kaepernick&#x27;s reasons for protesting but criticizing him for kneeling during the national anthem.

In 2019, Knight was invited to play at the 100th Anniversary of Delaware State Fair, located in Harrington, Delaware.

In 2022, Knight received Kennedy Center Honors, presented by U.S. President Joe Biden. She also headlined a U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit Dinner at the White House.

A glossy program was available and the show featured pre-produced animation on large on-stage screens. The tour was promoted by an appearance on the TV program &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; where Knight performed &quot;If I Were Your Woman&quot; and &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot;.

In spite of her &quot;farewell&quot;, Knight started touring the UK again a few years later, playing gigs in Scotland and England in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022 and 2024. A farewell tour of Australia and New Zealand was announced for March 2024.

In 1975, Knight starred in a variety show, &quot;The Gladys Knight and the Pips Show&quot;, which was canceled after four episodes. She also guest-starred on several TV series throughout the 1980s and 1990s, appearing on &quot;Benson,&quot; &quot;The Jeffersons,&quot; &quot;A Different World,&quot; &quot;Living Single,&quot; &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show,&quot; and &quot;New York Undercover.&quot; In 1985, she co-starred on the CBS sitcom &quot;Charlie &amp; Co.&quot;, alongside comedian Flip Wilson, which lasted for one season.

She finished behind Donny Osmond as &quot;Peacock&quot; and T-Pain as &quot;Monster&quot;.

==Business ventures==

Knight&#x27;s son Shanga Hankerson owns a chain of chicken and waffles restaurants based in Atlanta, bearing her name. Gladys Knight &amp; Ron Winans&#x27; Chicken &amp; Waffles opened three locations in the Atlanta area. One location was featured on the Travel Channel original series &quot;Man v. Food.&quot; In June 2016, authorities in Georgia raided two of the restaurants and its headquarters.

In 2016, WSB-TV reported that Hankerson was at the center of an investigation involving unpaid taxes, penalties and interest. Georgia Department of Revenue Special Investigations Chief Jeff Mitchell told the station that the investigation solely involved Hankerson and not Knight.

==Personal life==

In 1960, Knight married Atlanta musician and high school sweetheart James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Newman. The couple had a miscarriage and went on to have two children. Their son, James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Gaston Newman III, was born in 1962, and their daughter, Kenya Maria Newman, was born in 1963. In the early 1960s, Knight&#x27;s family and the Pips moved to Detroit. The family lived in Sherwood Forest, an upscale neighborhood on Detroit&#x27;s West Side. Knight retired from the road to raise their children while the Pips toured on their own, later returning with Newman as the group&#x27;s musical director. Newman later became addicted to drugs and left the family when Knight was 20. They remained married for over 12 years and were separated for 7 years until their divorce in 1973. Newman died a few years later.

In 1974, Knight married Barry Hankerson, founder of Blackground Records, in Detroit. The couple had a son, Shanga Ali Hankerson, born on August 1, 1976. Around 1977, they relocated to Las Vegas. Their marriage ended in 1979 with a prolonged custody battle over their son. Knight spent over a million dollars searching for her son after he was kidnapped. In 1995, Knight married motivational speaker Les Brown, divorcing in 1997.

Knight was raised a Baptist, later was a Catholic, and was baptized in 1997 into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, inspired by her daughter and son who had left Catholicism to join. She had occasionally teased LDS president Gordon B. Hinckley, saying they needed to inject some &quot;pep&quot; into their music. He agreed, which resulted in the founding of the Saints Unified Voices gospel choir directed by Knight. In 2018, Knight led the Be One Choir at the &quot;Be One&quot; event in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Knight has an honorary doctorate from Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Knight&#x27;s son Jimmy Newman III managed her career through his Newman Management Inc. until his death from heart failure on July 10, 1999, at age 36. Newman was survived by his wife, Michelene; daughters Nastasia and Gabrielle; and sons Rishawn, Stefan, and Sterling. Following his death, her daughter Kenya Jackson took over management.

Knight married William McDowell in 2001. They have seventeen grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren between them. Knight and McDowell reside in Fairview, North Carolina, near where they own a community center, the former Reynolds High School in Canton attended by McDowell.

In 2017, Knight helped raise $400,000 for the Children&#x27;s Learning Centers of Fairfield County. The event was held at the Palace Theatre and was co-hosted by Carol Anne Riddell and Alan Kalter.

Knight had a gambling addiction that lasted more than a decade. In the late 1980s, after losing $60,000 in one night at the baccarat table, she joined Gamblers Anonymous, which helped her quit the habit.

==Legacy==
In 1996, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. One year before, Knight had received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2007, Knight received the Society of Singers ELLA Award at which time she was declared the &quot;Empress of Soul&quot;. She is listed on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the Greatest Singers of All Time. In 2021, Knight received the National Medal of Arts. And, in 2022, Knight received a Kennedy Center Honor. In 2023, Knight received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>Ijma&#x27; (, ) is an Arabic term referring to the consensus or agreement of the Islamic community on a point of Islamic law. Sunni Muslims regard &quot;ijmā&quot;&#x27; as one of the secondary sources of Sharia law, after the Qur&#x27;an, and the Sunnah.
Exactly what group should represent the Muslim community in reaching the consensus is not agreed on by the various schools of Islamic jurisprudence. Some believe it should be the Sahaba (the first generation of Muslims) only; others the consensus of the Salaf (the first three generations of Muslims); or the consensus of Islamic lawyers, the jurists and scholars of the Muslim world, i.e. scholarly consensus; or the consensus of all the Muslim world, both scholars and lay people. The opposite of &quot;ijma&quot; (i.e., lack of consensus on a point of Islamic law) is called &quot;ikhtilaf&quot;.

==Proof of the validity of Ijma==

=== In the Quran ===
Imam Al-Shafi&#x27;i was once approached by an old man who asked for proof of Ijma from the Quran. Imam Al-Shafi&#x27;i went home and recited the whole Quran three times. On the third recitation, he found a verse in Sura An-Nisa (4:115) &quot;And whoever defies the Messenger after guidance has become clear to them and follows a path other than that of the believers, We will let them pursue what they have chosen, then burn them in Hell—what an evil end!&quot; which mentions the word &#x27;Sabeelil Mu&#x27;mineen&#x27; (the way of those of faith). Imam Al-Shafi&#x27;i told the old man this verse was a proof for Ijma from the Quran and he was satisfied. 

Another proof of Ijma from the Quran is in Sura Lukman (31:15) in which Allah mentions &quot;and follow the way of those who turn to Me in devotion&quot; Another proof of Ijma in the Quran is in Sura an-Nisa (4:83) in which Allah mentions &quot;And when they hear news of security or fear, they publicize it. Had they referred it to the Messenger or their authorities, those with sound judgment among them would have validated it. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy, you would have followed Satan—except for a few.&quot; Some scholars have the opinion that Surah Al Fatihah verse 1:6 and 1:7 which Muslims read at least 17 times a day (in their 5 daily Salah) is also an indirect support of Ijma. 

=== In the Hadith (Sayings of the Prophet) ===
The hadith of Muhammad which states that &quot;Allah will ensure my ummah will never collude en-masse upon error&quot; have been mentioned in the books of Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Musnah Ahmad, and Darimi. This is often quoted as the primary proof of Ijma from the Hadith from the Sunni View. 

Similar hadiths are often cited as a proof for the validity of ijma&#x27; as well. 

==Usage==

===Sunni view===
Sunni scholars argued that the nature of human society was such that a community could not mistakenly agree that a statement had been made, and further that the consensus of the &quot;ummah&quot; about its inability to agree upon an error in itself certified the authenticity of this hadith. Sunni Muslims and Scholars regard ijmā&#x27; as one of the secondary sources of Sharia law, just after the divine revelation of the Qur&#x27;an, and the prophetic practice known as Sunnah. Thus so a position of Majority should always be taken into consideration, when a matter cannot be concluded from the Qur&#x27;an or Hadith. 

There are differing views over who is considered a part of this consensus, whether &quot;the consensus is needed only among the scholars of a particular school, or legists, or legists of an early era, or the Companions, or scholars in general, or the entire Muslim community.&quot;

Malik ibn Anas held the view that the religiously binding consensus was only the consensus of Muhammad&#x27;s companions and the direct successors of those companions in the city of Medina.

According to Iraqi academic Majid Khadduri, Al-Shafi&#x27;i held the view that religiously binding consensus had to include all of the Muslim community in every part of the world, both the religiously learned and the layman. Thus, if even one individual out of millions would hold a differing view, then consensus would not have been reached. In an attempt to define consensus in a form which was more likely to ever occur, Al-Ghazali expanding on al-Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s definition to define consensus as including all of the Muslim community in regard to religious principles and restricting the meaning to only the religiously learned in regard to finer details.

Abu Hanifa, Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Dawud al-Zahiri, on the other hand, considered this consensus to only include the companions of Muhammad, excluding all generations which followed them, in Medina and elsewhere.

Views within Sunni Islam branched off even further in later generations, with Abu Bakr Al Jassas, a hanafi scholar, defining even a simple majority view as constituting consensus and Ibn Taymiyyah restricting consensus to the view of the religiously learned only. Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari&#x27;s position was not entirely clear, as modern scholarship has attributed to him both the view that consensus means a simple majority, and that it means only the consensus of the companions of Muhammad.

According to Ahmad Hasan, the majority view is split between two possibilities: that religiously binding consensus is the consensus of the entire Muslim community, or that religiously binding consensus is just the consensus of the religiously learned. The names of two kinds of consensus are:
* &quot;ijma al-ummah&quot; - a whole community consensus.
* &quot;ijma al-aimmah&quot; - a consensus by religious authorities.

===Shia view===
Initially, for Shia the authority of the Imams rendered the consensus as irrelevant. With the development of sectarian communities of Imami Shīa Islam, the question of guidance and interpretation between different ulama became an issue, however the importance of ijmā never reached the level and certainty it had in Sunni Islam. Later, since Safavid and with the establishment of Usuli school at the turn the 19th century the authority of living mujtahid is accepted, however it dies with him. For Shia, the status of ijmā is ambiguous.

===Mu&#x27;tazilite view===
The Mu&#x27;tazilite sect does not consider consensus to be a valid source of law, primarily due to their rationalist criticism of the first generation of Muslims, whom the Mu&#x27;tazila viewed as possessing defective personalities and intellects. Shi&#x27;ite theologians Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid and Sharif al-Murtaza held the Mu&#x27;tazilite theologian Nazzam&#x27;s book &quot;Kitab al-Nakth&quot;, in which his student Al-Jahiz reports that he denied the validity of consensus for this reason, in high esteem. Modern scholarship has suggested that this interest was motivated by the desire of Shi&#x27;ite theologians to impugn the character of the first three leaders of the Rashidun Caliphate, Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman.

<doc id="165912" wikidata="Q1209677" url="?curid=165912" title="Dick Gephardt">
<text>Richard Andrew Gephardt (; born January 31, 1941) is an American attorney, lobbyist, and politician who represented in the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, he was House majority leader from 1989 to 1995 and minority leader from 1995 to 2003. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 1988 and 2004. Gephardt was mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1988, 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2008.

Since his retirement from politics, Gephardt has become a significant lobbyist. He founded a Washington-based public affairs firm, Gephardt Government Affairs; an Atlanta-based labor consultancy, the Gephardt Group; and a direct primary care group, SolidaritUS Health. He also consults for DLA Piper, FTI Consulting and Goldman Sachs, and is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One and co-chair of Issue One&#x27;s Council for Responsible Social Media with former Massachusetts lieutenant governor Kerry Healey.

==Early life==
Gephardt was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Loreen Estelle (née Cassell) and Louis Andrew Gephardt, a Teamster milkman; part of his ancestry is German. He graduated from the former Southwest High School in 1958. Gephardt is an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. He earned his B.S. at Northwestern University in 1962 where he was president of Beta Theta Pi, the student senate, and his freshman class. He earned his J.D. at the University of Michigan Law School in 1965.

In 1965, Gephardt was admitted to the Missouri Bar. He then entered the Missouri Air National Guard, where he served until 1971. He and his wife Jane have three grown children, Matt, Katie, and Chrissy. His brother, Donald L. Gephardt, was the Dean of The College of Fine and Performing Arts at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. Gephardt was a Democratic committeeman (precinct captain) for the 14th ward in St. Louis from 1968 through 1971.

==St. Louis Board of Aldermen (1971–1976)==
Gephardt was the 14th ward alderman (city councilor) on the St. Louis Board of Aldermen from 1971 to 1976. On the council, he was part of a group of young aldermen known informally as &quot;The Young Turks.&quot;

==House of Representatives (1976–2003)==
===Early tenure===
In 1976, Gephardt was elected to Congress from the St. Louis–based 3rd District, succeeding 24-year incumbent Leonor Sullivan. He was elected 13 more times, opting not to run for reelection in 2004. For most of his Congressional career, Gephardt&#x27;s National Political Director was St. Louis–based political consultant Joyce Aboussie. Gephardt voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday in August 1983 but did not vote on the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (or the vote to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto in March 1988).

===1988 presidential campaign===
Gephardt was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 1988 presidential election. He formally announced his candidacy in February 1987—one of the first to do so—and campaigned hard in Iowa, ultimately spending over 100 days in the state. He was stuck in low double digits in polls, but began moving ahead in Iowa in late December 1987 after running an ad that criticized trade barriers by Korea and Japan as unfair. He won the Iowa caucuses and South Dakota primary in February while finishing a strong second in New Hampshire, making him a serious contender for the nomination.

Gephardt&#x27;s early victories did not translate into support in other states, though, and he was not able to raise adequate funds to compete in the Southern primaries. His campaign ran out of money after losing badly in the March &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; primaries, when he won only the Missouri primary. An ad aired by Governor Michael Dukakis&#x27;s campaign focused on Gephardt&#x27;s &quot;flip-flopping&quot; voting record and showed a Gephardt look-alike doing forward and backward flips for the camera. Many felt the ad killed any chance Gephardt had of winning the nomination. Gephardt dropped out after winning only 13% in Michigan, despite support from the United Auto Workers. Dukakis considered selecting Gephardt as his vice presidential running mate but instead chose Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen.

===House leadership===


In part due to the visibility gained from his 1988 presidential bid, Gephardt was elected majority leader by his House colleagues in June 1989, making him the second-ranking Democrat in the House, behind then-Speaker Tom Foley. Gephardt served in that position until January 1995.

After Foley was unseated in the Republican landslide of 1994 that gave the Republicans a 52-seat majority, Gephardt became the leader of the House Democrats, as minority leader, initially opposite Newt Gingrich and then, from 1999 onward, Dennis Hastert. When Gingrich faced a coup within his own party in 1997, Gephardt could have become Speaker if there had been a floor vote and he gained the support of Republican members dissatisfied with Gingrich, but Gingrich refused to resign and no vote occurred. In the 1996, 1998, and 2000 elections, Gephardt led the Democrats to gains in the House, although they did not retake the majority until 2006, after Gephardt had left Congress. Therefore, he is the first House Democratic leader who has not served as Speaker since Finis J. Garrett.

Gephardt became a prolific financial supporter of Democrats around the country in the early 1990s, assembling a team of top fundraising staff who helped him support hundreds of candidates for local and federal office. Although Gephardt worked hard for many of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s programs, he and his union supporters strongly opposed NAFTA and other &quot;free trade&quot; programs, so Clinton relied on Republican support to pass those initiatives. During the impeachment proceedings of President Clinton, Gephardt led a walkout in the House after a censure motion was ruled irrelevant to the impeachment debate.
In 2000, Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore named Gephardt to his short list of possible vice presidential candidates. The other names on the short list were Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, North Carolina Senator John Edwards, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, and New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen. Gore eventually selected Lieberman.

In the 2002 Congressional midterm elections, Gephardt campaigned on the economy and Social Security, but the continuing resonance of the September 11 attacks, the momentum for military action against Iraq, and President George W. Bush&#x27;s popularity lead to Republican gains, with the Democrats losing four House seats. Harold Ford Jr. of Tennessee called the results an &quot;absolute blowout&quot; and called upon Gephardt to step down, saying that it was time for &quot;new ideas and new faces&quot;. Due to his previous success, it has been said that Gephardt would have been easily returned as Minority Leader if he had decided to stay on. However, Gephardt, who was planning to run for president in 2004, did not run for reelection as House Minority Leader, stepping down in January 2003. His leadership position was contested by the centrist Martin Frost, the outgoing Democratic Caucus Chair, and the liberal Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Whip, who was elected as Gephardt&#x27;s successor. No longer having Congressional leadership duties freed Gephardt up to concentrate on a 2004 presidential bid.

===2004 presidential campaign===

Gephardt announced his second run for president on January 5, 2003. His successor as Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, endorsed him. His campaign was notable for the high-profile coming out of his daughter Chrissy in &quot;People&quot; magazine, while she was helping him on the campaign trail, a subject they also discussed in interviews for the 2007 documentary film &quot;For the Bible Tells Me So&quot;; he has continued to be an outspoken advocate for gay rights since the campaign.

Although Republicans considered him a formidable candidate, Gephardt was seen by many as too old-fashioned and unelectable. His fundraising efforts were behind those of former Vermont Governor Howard Dean and Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, and tied with Joe Lieberman. Gephardt&#x27;s support of the Iraq War resolution hurt him among liberal activists. He promoted a form of universal health care, and was backed by 21 labor unions, but did not have enough support to receive the AFL–CIO&#x27;s endorsement.
Throughout early 2003, Gephardt was ahead in polling for the Iowa caucus, but by August Dean had taken the lead, his campaign fueled by antiwar activists. The Gephardt campaign was embarrassed by an early August &quot;St Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; article that revealed that 11 of the 33 &quot;Gephardt team leaders&quot; listed on his Iowa campaign&#x27;s website actually supported other candidates or were neutral.

The race between Gephardt and Dean became negative, and took an ugly turn in October when a Gephardt staffer reportedly pushed a Dean staffer out of a meeting while calling him a &quot;faggot&quot;. Many press at the event claimed the Dean staffer was picking a fight and that the Gephardt staffer did not make the hurtful comment. Dean chairman Joe Trippi (who worked for Gephardt in 1988) and Gephardt chairman Steve Murphy became involved in a war of words over the incident, as well as Murphy&#x27;s allegation that the Dean campaign was bringing in out-of-state non-residents to participate in the caucus. In the final days of the Iowa campaign, both Dean and Gephardt faded, and they finished third and fourth, respectively. Gephardt ended his presidential campaign after that disappointing result.

After he dropped out of the presidential race, Gephardt was mentioned as a possible running mate for John Kerry. On March 7, 2004, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, also seen as a strong contender for the position, endorsed Gephardt for Vice President. Richardson said of Gephardt in an interview with the Associated Press, &quot;I think he&#x27;s the best candidate. There&#x27;s a good regional balance with Kerry and Gephardt.&quot; Kerry announced on July 6, 2004, that he had chosen John Edwards as his running mate. On the same day, the &quot;New York Post&quot; published a headline stating that Gephardt had become Kerry&#x27;s running mate. The headline was compared to the 1948 &quot;Dewey defeats Truman&quot; headline in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that incorrectly reported the presidential election results that year. In 2007, it was revealed in Kerry campaign adviser Bob Shrum&#x27;s book &quot;No Excuses: Concessions of a Serial Campaigner&quot; that Kerry wanted to choose Gephardt but was convinced by Shrum and others to choose Edwards.

==Political views==
After his election to the U.S. House in 1976, Gephardt&#x27;s political views gradually moved to the left. Originally, Gephardt was strongly anti-abortion and was viewed as a social conservative. He was initially extremely critical of the U.S. Supreme Court landmark &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; ruling that legalized abortion. He wrote on the subject in 1984:
In 1987, when Gephardt decided to run for president, he announced that he would no longer support legislation to restrict abortion rights. He told the National Right to Life Committee; &quot;I now do not support any Constitutional amendment pertaining to the legality of abortion.&quot; Gephardt&#x27;s views on economic policy also changed over the years. He voted for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts in 1981; in the 2000s, he became a staunch opponent of similar tax cuts by President George W. Bush, saying that the enormous surplus created during the administration of Bill Clinton should have been spent on health care instead. Gephardt is widely viewed as an economic populist. He supports universal health coverage, fair trade, and progressive taxation. Although he once chaired the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, Gephardt in his later years in Congress distanced himself from the organization, finding his pro-labor views at odds with the DLC&#x27;s pro-business positions.

On October 10, 2002, Gephardt was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He was an early supporter of the war, and cosponsor of the authorization resolution. However, three years later Gephardt said of his support for the war that &quot;It was a mistake ... I was wrong.&quot;

==Post-congressional career==
On January 3, 2005, Gephardt&#x27;s three-decade political career ended with the expiration of his 14th term in the House of Representatives. That month, Gephardt started a consulting and lobbying firm, Gephardt Group, of which he is president and CEO. Gephardt also joined the international law firm DLA Piper as strategic advisor in the government affairs practice group from June 2005 to December 2009.

In his new role as a Washington lobbyist, Gephardt, on behalf of the Republic of Turkey, has been actively lobbying against the House resolution condemning the Armenian genocide of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire. While supportive of the resolution while in Congress, he now contends that facts need to be better known before any position is taken on this historical controversy. Gephardt served on the board of directors of the Embarq Corporation from June 2007 to July 1, 2009, when he became a member of the board of directors of CenturyLink, Embarq&#x27;s successor corporation. Gephardt also serves as a director of Centene Corporation, Ford Motor Company, Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc., and United States Steel Corporation. He joined Ford&#x27;s board in 2009.

In July 2007, Gephardt endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, leading some to speculate that he was interested in running for vice president in 2008. DLA Piper become a major donor to Clinton&#x27;s campaign, donating about $190,000. Gephardt was mentioned during the summer of 2008 as a possible vice-presidential choice for eventual nominee Senator Barack Obama. A collection of Gephardt&#x27;s congressional documents, dating from 1994 to 2004, was processed from 2006 to 2007 by the Missouri Historical Society for academic use, with a grant through the Institute of Museum and Library Services. In 2005, Washington University in St. Louis inaugurated the Richard A. Gephardt Institute of Public Service (now the Gephardt Institute for Civic and Community Engagement), which educates students for life-long engaged citizenship and civic leadership. Since 2005, Gephardt has been a consultant to Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper. Since 2007 he has been a consultant to FTI Consulting.

In 2007, Gephardt began serving on the advisory board of the Extend Health insurance company, and then became a member of its board of directors. In 2009, Gephardt advised UnitedHealth Group, one of America&#x27;s largest private insurers, in waging a strong campaign against a public option for national health care. In 2010, Gephardt was elected chair of the Board of Trustees of The Scripps Research Institute, a nonprofit institute focusing on biomedical research.
Gephardt has been significantly involved with the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. In addition to a large lobbying contract with the Medicines Company, he serves as chair of the Council for American Medical Innovation (CAMI), formed by and affiliated with PhRMA. In this capacity he hired his own firm to lobby for the organization, to push to extend patents and block generic drugs from the market. In 2016, Gephardt also co-founded a Direct primary care group called SolidaritUS Health, with the goal of increasing the accessibility of quality healthcare to working families.

Gephardt has also served as a lobbyist for Boeing. He is a labor consultant for Spirit Aerosystems and sits on its board of directors. In these roles, Gephardt has presided over an aggressive anti-union campaign that has bewildered many of his traditional political allies. In July 2011, Spirit Aerosystems walked out of negotiations with the union that represents its engineering, technical and professional workforce. The union subsequently voted down the company&#x27;s last contract offer, with 96.5% voting no. The company did not change its contract offer significantly after this rejection and relations with its workforce have been contentious ever since. With negotiations at a standstill, production schedules for 2011 and 2012 were threatened. Around mid-2023 Spirit Aerosystems agreed to a new contract with its workers at the Wichita, Kansas plant. Key provisions in the contract include increased pay, workers being allowed to keep their current health plans, and removal of mandatory overtime requirements.

In October 2022, Gephardt, along with Republican former Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey, launched the Council for Responsible Social Media, a project of nonprofit organization Issue One, which he had already been involved with as a member of its ReFormers Caucus. Gephardt and Healey serve as co-chairs of the project, which focuses on addressing the harmful influence social media can have on children, communities, and national security. In May 2024, Gephardt gave the commencement address and received an honorary degree at Iona University in New Rochelle, New York.

<text>Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (abbreviated as EW&amp;F or EWF) is an American band formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1969. Their music spans multiple genres, including jazz, R&amp;B, soul, funk, disco, pop, Latin and Afro-pop. They are among the best-selling bands of all time, with sales of over 90 million records worldwide.

The band was formed by Maurice White, originating out of the Salty Peppers; its history includes a hiatus from mid-1984 to mid-1987. Prominent members have included Verdine White, Philip Bailey, Ralph Johnson, Larry Dunn, Al McKay, Roland Bautista, Robert Brookins, Sonny Emory, Freddie Ravel, Ronnie Laws, Sheldon Reynolds and Andrew Woolfolk. The band is known for its kalimba sound, dynamic horn section, energetic and elaborate stage shows, and the contrast between Bailey&#x27;s falsetto and Maurice&#x27;s tenor vocals.

The band has won six Grammy Awards out of 17 nominations and four American Music Awards out of 12 nominations. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame, and Hollywood&#x27;s Rockwalk, and earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The band has also received an ASCAP Rhythm &amp; Soul Heritage Award, a BET Lifetime Achievement Award, a Soul Train Legend Award, a NARAS Signature Governor&#x27;s Award, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the 2012 Congressional Horizon Award, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2019. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has called them &quot;innovative, precise yet sensual, calculated yet galvanizing&quot; and declared that the band &quot;changed the sound of black pop&quot;. VH1 has described EWF as &quot;one of the greatest bands&quot;.

==History==
===1969–1970: Beginnings===
In 1969, Maurice White, a former session drummer for Chess Records and former member of the Ramsey Lewis Trio, joined two friends in Chicago, Wade Flemons and Don Whitehead, as a songwriting team. They wrote songs and commercials in the Chicago area. The three friends got a recording contract with Capitol Records. Calling themselves The Salty Peppers, they had a marginal hit single in the Midwest titled &quot;La La Time&quot;.

The Salty Peppers&#x27; second single, &quot;Uh Huh Yeah&quot;, did not fare as well. Maurice moved from Chicago to Los Angeles. He added singer Sherry Scott and percussionist Yackov Ben Israel, both from Chicago, to the band. He asked his younger brother Verdine to join and on June 6, 1970, Verdine moved from Chicago to LA to become the band&#x27;s bassist. Maurice began shopping demo tapes featuring Donny Hathaway to various record labels and the band eventually signed to Warner Bros. Records.

===1970–1974: Formation and early years===
Maurice White&#x27;s astrological sign, Sagittarius, has a primary elemental quality of fire and seasonal qualities of earth and air, according to classical triplicities. Sagittarius in the northern hemisphere occurs in the autumn, whose element is earth, and in the southern hemisphere, it is spring, whose element is air. Hence the omission of water, the fourth classical element. Based on this, he changed the band&#x27;s name, to Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. White held further auditions in L.A, adding Michael Beal on guitar, Chester Washington on reeds, and Leslie Drayton on trumpet. White was a percussionist and lead vocalist. Drayton served as the group&#x27;s arranger. Trombonist Alex Thomas completed the then ten-man lineup. Warner Bros. designated Joe Wissert to be the band&#x27;s producer.

==== Earth, Wind &amp; Fire ====
The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in March 1971 on Warner Bros. The album got to No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and was certified Gold in France by the SNEP.

Lester Bangs of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted a &quot;heavy Sly influence&quot; and the &quot;smooth harmonies&quot; of The Fifth Dimension on the LP. Bob Talbert of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; also wrote &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what to call this group. Afro-gospel-jazz-blues-rock? Must there be a label?&quot;.

==== &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadassss Song&quot; ====
EWF went on to supply the entire soundtrack of the Melvin Van Peebles feature film &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;. The soundtrack, composed by Van Peebles, was released in April 1971 on Stax Records. Ian McCann of udiscovermusic.com found &quot;Today, though, you couldn&#x27;t find a record, soundtrack, or otherwise, as freewheelin&#x27; and funky as this.&quot; Jamie Atkins of Record Collector also found the soundtrack is &quot;Well worth checking out.&quot; The album reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Albums chart.

==== &quot;The Need of Love&quot; ====
In November 1971, EWF&#x27;s second album, titled &quot;The Need of Love&quot;, was issued. The LP got to No. 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart. Bruce Lindsay of Jazz Journal said &quot;as evidence of a tight, stylish, band in the early stages of its career this is a worthwhile album&quot;. Al Rudis of The Chicago Sun-Times wrote &quot;Their second album, The Need of Love again displays some unusual music that might be called avant garde were it not so melodic and entrancing. The nine-member group mixes excellent jazzy instrumentals with harmony singing and chanting, some big band sounds and some free-form parts as well as solid soul beats. It all works beautifully, and while the elements of Earth, Wind and Fire aren&#x27;t new, this mixture of them is a unique sound&quot;.

A single from the album called &quot;I Think About Lovin&#x27; You&quot; reached No. 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart.

The band became popular on college campuses, although some members started to become restless and the band eventually split. With only Verdine left, Maurice decided to re-form the group.

During 1972, Maurice added vocalist Helena Davis, Ronnie Laws on the flute and saxophone, rhythm guitarist Roland Bautista, keyboardist Larry Dunn, vocalist Philip Bailey and percussionist Ralph Johnson. Davis was soon replaced by Jessica Cleaves, a former member of the R&amp;B group The Friends of Distinction.

The band successfully auditioned for managers Bob Cavallo and Joe Ruffalo. Cavallo&#x27;s management of John Sebastian led to a series of gigs as his opening act. A performance at New York&#x27;s Rockefeller Center introduced EWF to Clive Davis, then-President of Columbia Records. Davis was impressed and bought their contract from Warner Bros. Wissert went along with the band.

==== &quot;Last Days and Time&quot; ====
Their debut album on CBS/Columbia Records, &quot;Last Days and Time&quot;, was issued in October 1972. The album got to No. 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and No. 9 on the UK Blues &amp; Soul Top British Soul Albums chart. Paul Sexton of Record Mirror proclaimed &quot;Musical historians and EWF fans alike will welcome (&quot;Last Days and Time)&quot;&quot;. Ovid Goode Jr. of &quot;The Los Angeles Daily News&quot; declared &quot;&quot;Last Days and Time&quot;, sprouts forth with a fresh sound that sets it apart from many of the ho-hum aggregations around today. The album consists of eight moving tunes&quot;. Hip Hop artist Nas was also inspired by the album&#x27;s cover art while British singer Gabrielle also named Last Days and Time as one of her favorites.

A single called &quot;Mom&quot; got to No. 39 on the Cashbox Top R&amp;B Singles chart.

Soon thereafter, Roland Bautista and Ronnie Laws left. Denver native Philip Bailey recommended his former East High School classmate, saxophonist Andrew Woolfolk, as a replacement for Laws. Woolfolk had been busy in New York studying sax with sax maestro Joe Henderson and was due to start a career in banking at the time. To fill the void created by Bautista&#x27;s departure, rhythm guitarists Al McKay and Johnny Graham were added. Graham previously played with New Birth, while McKay was a former member of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue and The Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band.

==== &quot;Head to the Sky&quot; ====
EWF&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Head to the Sky&quot;, was released in May 1973. The album rose to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and No. 27 on the Billboard 200 chart. &quot;Head to the Sky&quot; was certified US Platinum by the RIAA.

Vince Aletti of Rolling Stone declared &quot;Been having a lot of music dreams lately but this one&#x27;s not too surprising since I&#x27;ve been playing the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire album pretty constantly for the past week, certainly beyond all expectations&quot;. Aletti also noted EWF &quot;sound like a cosmic choir and generate a Sly Stone effect&quot; on the album. Tony Palermo of the Pittsburgh Press wrote &quot;Folks like to compare this bunch with War, but the first difference that hits you with E,W&amp;F&#x27;s brand of jazz-rhythm and blues is the smoothness of Jessica Cleaves&#x27; vocal work. Then, the extra slug of R&amp;B in their style&quot;.

A single off the LP titled &quot;Evil&quot; got to No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary Songs and No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs charts respectively. Another single called
&quot;Keep Your Head to the Sky&quot; rose to No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart. Jessica Cleaves left after the album release.

==== &quot;Open Our Eyes&quot; ====
The band&#x27;s follow-up album was co-produced by Maurice and Wissert. This LP was recorded at James William Guercio&#x27;s Caribou Ranch Studio and &quot;Open Our Eyes&quot; was released in March 1974. Ken Emerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Open Our Eyes&quot; &quot;a pleasant miscellany of Africana, Latin rhythms, well-mannered funk, smooth jazz, Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder and the Fifth Dimension&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau described the album as a complete &quot;tour de force&quot;. The album rose to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and No. 15 on the Billboard 200 chart. &quot;Open Our Eyes&quot; was certified US Platinum.

A single from the LP called &quot;Mighty Mighty&quot; reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. &quot;Kalimba Story&quot; rose to No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart. &quot;Devotion&quot; got to No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

After &quot;Open Our Eyes&quot; was issued, Maurice&#x27;s younger brother, Fred White, joined the band. He had previously played in Chicago clubs as a drummer with Donny Hathaway and Little Feat.

On April 6, 1974, EWF performed at the California Jam, a West Coast rock festival that attracted an audience of 200,000. The concert was televised in the US on May 10, 1974, by ABC.

==== &quot;Another Time&quot; ====
In September 1974, a compilation double album titled &quot;Another Time,&quot; comprising songs from EWF&#x27;s first two studio albums, was released by Warner Bros. The album got to No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart.

The band collaborated with Ramsey Lewis on his album &quot;Sun Goddess,&quot; which was produced by Maurice and issued in October 1974 by Columbia. The album got to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The LP&#x27;s title track rose to No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart.
&quot;Sun Goddess&quot; was certified US Gold.

===1975–1980: Ornate sound===
==== &quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot; ====
During 1975, EWF was approached by Sig Shore, producer of the motion picture &quot;Super Fly&quot;, to record the soundtrack to a new film titled &quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot;. With a screenplay from Robert Lipsyte, the film was produced and directed by Shore. The film starred Harvey Keitel, Ed Nelson, EWF as &quot;The Group&quot; and Maurice as Early, &quot;The Group&quot;&#x27;s leader. Keitel played the role of a record producer who hears &quot;The Group&quot; performing and is wowed by their act.

When the band saw the film they were convinced that it would become a box office bomb, which it eventually was. They therefore released the film&#x27;s soundtrack before the film&#x27;s premiere. The LP was produced by White and Charles Stepney and recorded at the Caribou Ranch Studio. Stepney had previously worked with artists such as the Dells, Terry Callier and Minnie Riperton and the Rotary Connection, of which Riperton was a member. Stepney&#x27;s writing and production style included a more ornate, orchestral flourish, which influenced the soundtrack album.

&quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot; was eventually issued in March 1975 by Columbia. The album rose to No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums charts. Stephen Curwood of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called the LP &quot;a sound you shouldn&#x27;t miss.&quot; Daryl Easlea of the BBC described &quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot; as a &quot;soul masterpiece&quot;. The album was certified US triple platinum.

From the LP came the single &quot;Shining Star&quot;, which rose to No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot Soul Singles charts. This made EWF the first black act to top both the &quot;Billboard&quot; album and singles charts. The song won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The album&#x27;s second single was title track &quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot;. It reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Singles chart and No. 12 on the Hot 100 chart.

With the album&#x27;s success the band was able to hire their own horn section, dubbed the Phenix Horns. They were composed of saxophonist Don Myrick, trombonist Louis Satterfield, and trumpeters Rahmlee Davis and Michael Harris. Myrick and Satterfield had both previously worked with White during his days as a session drummer at Chess Records.

==== &quot;Gratitude&quot; ====
After their first European tour, EWF returned to the studio in June 1975. The band eventually came away with an album of mostly live concert material together with some new tracks. As a double LP &quot;Gratitude&quot; was issued in November 1975. It rose to No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Soul Albums charts respectively. Kit Aiken of Uncut called Gratitude &quot;a kicking live album&quot;. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune found &quot;an Ellingtonian fusion of styles on this live masterpiece.&quot; The album was certified US triple platinum.

With the LP came &quot;Sing a Song&quot;, which rose to numbers 1 and 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts, respectively. &quot;Can&#x27;t Hide Love&quot; got to No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart. &quot;Can&#x27;t Hide Love&quot; was Grammy nominated for Best Arrangement For Voices. The album&#x27;s title track was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

During 1975, White established a production company called Kalimba Productions. He signed artists such as his former bandleader Ramsey Lewis; singer Deniece Williams, who had once been a member of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Wonderlove&quot; backup group; and girl group the Emotions. Maurice loaned the band&#x27;s signature Phenix Horns and most of the other band members and put these and others Kalimba artists on tour with EWF.

While co-producing and arranging EWF&#x27;s follow-up LP, Williams&#x27;s debut album, &quot;This Is Niecy&quot;, Ramsey Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Salongo&quot;, and the Emotions&#x27; &quot;Flowers&quot;, their first album on Columbia Records, Charles Stepney died of a heart attack on May 17, 1976, in Chicago at the age of 45.

==== &quot;Spirit&quot; ====
With Stepney&#x27;s death, White went on to produce the band&#x27;s new LP, &quot;Spirit&quot;, which was issued in October 1976. The album&#x27;s title paid tribute to Stepney. The LP rose to No. 2 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums and Top Soul Albums charts. Music Week commented &quot;With a more spiritual, ethereal feel than the six albums they had already cut to that point, it really marks a turning point in their career and is crammed with excellent tunes.&quot;John Abbey of Blues &amp; Soul described Spirit as &quot;a mighty, mighty album&quot; which shows &quot;the power of the nine-piece Earth Wind &amp; Fire conglomeration.&quot; &quot;Spirit&quot; was certified US double platinum.

&quot;Getaway&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart. The song also rose to No. 12 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Dance Club Play charts. &quot;Saturday Nite&quot; reached numbers 4 and 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts, respectively. &quot;Saturday Nite&quot; rose to No. 12 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs and UK Pop Singles charts, respectively. The track &quot;Earth, Wind and Fire&quot; was Grammy nominated for Best Instrumental Composition.

During this period, EWF concerts became loaded with pyrotechnics, magic, laser lights, flying pyramids, levitating guitarists and elaborate production tricks that included the entire group ascending in a pyramid and a disappearing act. Stage magician Doug Henning appeared on many of their tours with his assistant and eventual successor, David Copperfield. George Faison began choreographing the shows.

==== &quot;All &#x27;n All&quot; ====
In November 1977, EWF released &quot;All &#x27;n All&quot;, their eighth studio album. It was inspired by Maurice&#x27;s month-long trip through Argentina and Brazil. The album rose to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared &quot;&quot;All &#x27;n All&quot; shows Maurice White and his cohorts pushing their music ever more in a febrile jazz‐rock direction.&quot; Monroe Anderson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the album as a &quot;rare blend of poetry, passion and artistic progression.&quot;

&quot;All &#x27;n All&quot; won a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance By A Duo, Group Or Chorus. The album was certified US triple platinum.

&quot;Serpentine Fire&quot; rose to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Fantasy&quot; reached No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Fantasy&quot; was Grammy-nominated for Best R&amp;B Song. &quot;Runnin&quot; won a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Instrumental.

Thereafter the band performed a medley on a musical special hosted by Natalie Cole which aired in April 1978 on CBS. EWF later appeared in the July 1978 feature film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band,&quot; which was an eventual commercial failure&quot;.&quot; During the film EWF&#x27;s rendered a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;. This tune was the biggest hit single from the movie&#x27;s soundtrack, reaching No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B songs chart and No. 9 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop singles chart. &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and won a Grammy in the category of Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s). The film&#x27;s soundtrack was also certified US platinum.

==== &quot;The Best of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Vol. 1&quot; ====
In 1978, White established a subsidiary label of CBS titled The American Record Company (ARC). Soon afterwards he launched, alongside sound engineer George Massenburg, a new recording studio dubbed The Complex in West Los Angeles. In November 1978, EWF issued a compilation album entitled &quot;The Best of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Vol. 1 on&quot; ARC/Columbia. It rose to No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; claimed &quot;this record is a well-paced showcase.&quot; Crispin Cioe of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; wrote &quot;For pop/r&amp;b mavens, this one&#x27;s a must.&quot; The album was certified quintuple platinum in the US by the RIAA.

A new song called &quot;September&quot; was released as a single, peaking to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;September&quot; also reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart.

In January 1979, the band performed &quot;September&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot; at the Music for UNICEF Concert. The concert was broadcast worldwide from the United Nations General Assembly. Other artists who performed at the event were ABBA, Andy Gibb, the Bee Gees, Olivia Newton-John, Donna Summer and Rod Stewart. The concert was Emmy-nominated in the category of Outstanding Individual Achievement - Special Class.

==== &quot;I Am&quot; ====
During June 1979, EWF issued their ninth studio album, &quot;I Am&quot;. The LP rose to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;I Am&quot; was certified US double platinum.

Eric Sieger of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; called &quot;I Am&quot; &quot;faultlessly produced.&quot; James Johnson of the Evening Standard scribed &quot;On I Am..the band&#x27;s flashy staccato rhythms, their smooth melodies and precise production adds up to another majestic album&quot;.

&quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot;, featuring the Emotions, got to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was also Grammy nominated in the categories of Best Disco Recording and Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance.

&quot;After the Love Has Gone&quot; reached No. 2 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot Soul Songs charts. The song made No. 3 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary Songs and UK Pop Singles charts. The ballad was Grammy-nominated in the category of Record of the Year. &quot;After the Love Has Gone&quot; won a Grammy for the Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group.

==== &quot;Faces&quot; ====
During October 1980, EWF issued a double album titled &quot;Faces&quot;. This LP was in the emerging post-disco style and was partly recorded on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. The album rose to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and No. 10 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and UK Albums charts. &quot;Faces&quot; was certified US gold.

In a 2007 interview, when asked which EWF album was his favorite, Maurice White replied: &quot;Probably &quot;Faces&quot; because we were really in tune...and it gave us the opportunity to explore new areas.&quot; Soon after its release, rhythm guitarist Al McKay left the band.

Dennis Hunt of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared &quot;&quot;Faces&quot; is the R&amp;B album of the year.&quot; Chuck Pratt of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; exclaimed &quot;this fine funk soul group puts its best face forward on this ambitious and generous double pocket set of intricately produced, high gloss funk.&quot;

A song off the LP titled &quot;Let Me Talk&quot; reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Singles chart and No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart. Another single called &quot;You&quot; got to No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Singles chart and No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary Songs chart. &quot;And Love Goes On&quot; rose to No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Singles chart.

===1981–1996: Electric sound===

==== &quot;Raise!&quot; ====
White decided that, given the changing musical landscape, the band needed to incorporate into their work more of the electronic sound which was popular at the time. As a result, EWF&#x27;s eleventh album, &quot;Raise!&quot;, was influenced by this new electronic sound and released in the Autumn of 1981. With this album rhythm guitarist Roland Bautista returned to EWF.

Pam Lambert of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; exclaimed &quot;After more than a decade together, Earth, Wind and Fire continue to chart new ground&quot;. She added, &quot;In Maurice&#x27;s otherwordly universe of synthesized sound, individual instruments like guitars and keyboards are drowned into the overall sonic mix.

<doc id="165917" wikidata="Q239043" url="?curid=165917" title="Green-Wood Cemetery">
<text>Green-Wood Cemetery is a cemetery in the western portion of Brooklyn, New York City. The cemetery is located between South Slope/Greenwood Heights, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Borough Park, Kensington, and Sunset Park, and lies several blocks southwest of Prospect Park. Its boundaries include, among other streets, 20th Street to the northeast, Fifth Avenue to the northwest, 36th and 37th Streets to the southwest, Fort Hamilton Parkway to the south, and McDonald Avenue to the east.

Green-Wood Cemetery was founded in 1838 as a rural cemetery, in a time of rapid urbanization when churchyards in New York City were becoming overcrowded. Described as &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s first public park by default long before Prospect Park was created&quot;, Green-Wood Cemetery was so popular that it inspired a competition to design Central Park in Manhattan, as well as Prospect Park nearby.

The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 and was made a National Historic Landmark in 2006. In addition, the 25th Street gates, the Weir Greenhouse, and the Fort Hamilton Parkway Gate &amp; Green-Wood Cemetery Chapel were separately designated as city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission at various times.

== Design ==
Green-Wood&#x27;s site is characterized by varied topography created by glacial moraines, particularly the Harbor Hill Moraine. Battle Hill, also known as Gowan&#x27;s Heights, the highest point in Brooklyn, is on cemetery grounds, rising approximately above sea level. It was the site of an important action during the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776. A Revolutionary War monument by Frederick Ruckstull, &quot;Altar to Liberty: Minerva&quot;, was erected there in 1920. From this height, the bronze Minerva statue gazes towards the Statue of Liberty across New York Harbor.

Green-Wood was less inspired by Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, which at the time retained the primarily axial formality of Alexandre Théodore Brongniart&#x27;s original design, than by Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where a cemetery in a naturalistic park-like landscape in the English manner was first established. It has been called &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s first public park by default long before Prospect Park was created.&quot; The architecture critic Paul Goldberger was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1977, saying, &quot;it is the ambition of the New Yorker to live upon the Fifth Avenue, to take his airings in the [Central] Park, and to sleep with his fathers in Green-wood&quot;.

Green-Wood Cemetery contains 600,000 graves and 7,000 trees spread out over . The landscape includes rolling hills and dales, several ponds, and an on-site chapel. In 2017, it received 280,000 visitors. Though at one point there were numerous gravediggers at Green-Wood, there were just a few gravediggers due to a decrease in the number of burials, as well as the limited amount of space for new burials. Because of this shortage of space, several family members may be buried atop each other in some plots.

Several wooden shelters were also built, including one in a Gothic Revival style, one resembling an Italian villa, and another resembling a Swiss chalet. These shelters, designed by Richard Upjohn, had largely deteriorated by the late 20th century except for a ladies&#x27; shelter. In 2008, Green-Wood started to acquire a collection of art pertaining to those buried in the cemetery.

=== Landscaping and circulation ===
Green-Wood Cemetery contains numerous landscape features, which in turn are named after terms that evoke a naturalistic scene. These names include Camellia Path, Halcyon Lake, Oaken Bluff, Sylvan Cliff, and Vista Hill. David Bates Douglass, Green-Wood&#x27;s landscape architect, mostly kept the cemetery&#x27;s natural landscaping intact. Much of Douglass&#x27;s plan is still in place with its original plantings and curving-road systems. The original street names and original cast-iron perimeter fence have been retained, but many of the roads have been paved.

The cemetery has been expanded several times. Most of these regions have been landscaped to resemble the original plot, except the area near Fort Hamilton Avenue to the north, which is flatter because it was acquired last.

=== Monuments ===
There are several notable monuments and mausoleums in the cemetery, designed in several styles including the Classical, Egyptian, Gothic, and Romanesque. Some of monuments and mausoleums were designed by popular architects of the time, including Minard Lafever, Richard Upjohn, and Warren and Wetmore. In addition, many tombs contain ornate sculptural decoration. The National Register of Historic Places designation subdivides these monuments into four primary categories: those honoring events or professions; those with architectural significance; those whose graves contain people of historical significance; and &quot;monuments of sculptural interest&quot;.

Among the first monuments was a statue of DeWitt Clinton, built in 1853. There is also a memorial erected by James Brown, president of both Brown Brothers bank and the Collins Line, to the six members of his family lost in the disaster of 1854. This incorporates a sculpture of the ship, half-submerged by the waves, as well as a Civil War Memorial. During the American Civil War, Green-Wood Cemetery created the &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Lot&quot; for free veterans&#x27; burials; this lot included less than of land. In 1868–1876, after the war ended, the Civil War Soldiers&#x27; Monument was erected at the highest point in Green-Wood.

Other monuments of note include the Pilots&#x27; Monument and the Sea Captain&#x27;s Monument, each dedicated to a notable person in these respective professions. &quot;J. Marion Sims&quot;, a monument of gynecologist J. Marion Sims by Ferdinand Freiherr von Miller, is also installed in Green-Wood; the statue was formerly in Bryant Park and Central Park but was removed from the latter in 2017. Some elaborate monuments honor notable figures, such as William Niblo&#x27;s Grand Gothic mausoleum, the Steinway &amp; Sons family&#x27;s Classical mausoleum, Abiel Abbot Low&#x27;s tomb, and the Lispenard family&#x27;s Norman-style mausoleum. Numerous other monuments to notable figures exist but are extremely simple in design, such as the tombs of Samuel Morse, William M. Tweed, Lola Montez, Henry Ward Beecher, and Currier and Ives. On the other hand, several monuments commemorate less well-known figures, including a Gothic memorial for 17-year-old Charlotte Canda, and a High Victorian pier designed by William or Edward Potter for their relatives.

=== Gates ===

The gates were designed by Richard Upjohn in Gothic Revival style. There are four gates in total. Two are city landmarks: the main gate at 25th Street to the northwest, which is closest to South Slope/Greenwood Heights, and Fort Hamilton Parkway to the south, which is in Kensington. Two additional gates exist. One of these, at 20th Street and Ninth Avenue, provides access from the northeast and is in Windsor Terrace. The other, at 34th Street and Fourth Avenue, provides access from the southwest and is located next to Sunset Park and the 36th Street station of the New York City Subway, serving the . These gates were developed from the 1840s to the 1860s. A fifth gate at Ninth Avenue and 37th Street no longer exists.

==== 25th Street gate ====
The main entrance to the cemetery, a double-gate located at 25th Street and Fifth Avenue near its northwestern corner, was built in 1861–65, though the entrance itself opened in 1862. It is composed of Belleville, New Jersey brownstone. The sculptured groups on Nova Scotia limestone panels depicting biblical scenes of death and resurrection from the New Testament including Lazarus, The Widow&#x27;s Son, and Jesus&#x27; Resurrection over the gateways are the work of sculptor John M. Moffitt. In between the two gateways is a clock tower in the Flamboyant style. The tower measures tall. A cemetery office is to one side of the gate, while the chapel and reception room are on the opposite side. A descendant colony of monk parakeets that are believed to have escaped their containers while in transit now nests in the spires of the gate, as well as other areas in Brooklyn.

The New York Community Trust placed a Designated Landmarks of New York plaque on the gate in 1958, and the gate was designated an official New York City landmark in 1966.

==== Fort Hamilton gate ====

The Fort Hamilton gate is located at Fort Hamilton Parkway and Macieli Place. Similar to the 25th Street gate, it is made of a double gateway made of brownstone. It is also flanked by two structures, a visitor&#x27;s lounge and the gatekeeper&#x27;s residence. The gate was built in 1876 and completed the next year; it was designated as an official New York City landmark in 2016.

To the east of the entrance is the visitor&#x27;s lounge, a brownstone building. It is a -story structure with an entrance located inside a center bay on the west side of the building. The visitor&#x27;s lounge contains two side bays, each with a porch, as well as restrooms for men and women. The hip roof is made of gray slate with metal ornamentation along the ridge at the top. The roof slopes down toward the perimeter walls of the building, though each of the four sides of the roof is punctuated by dormers with small windows. The corner porches feature stone banisters, and contain four yellow sandstone bas-reliefs sculpted by Moffitt.

The west side of the entrance, also a brownstone structure, contains the gatekeeper&#x27;s residence, a -story structure that is similar in design to the visitor&#x27;s lounge. Only the center section is stories, while the two pavilions to the west and east are stories. The residence&#x27;s main entrance is through the eastern pavilion, while there is another pavilion on the western facade. Both pavilions have hip roofs of gray slate, and the second floor contains dormers with windows that project from the hip roof. The central &quot;tower&quot; section contains entrances to both the north and south, as well as windows on the second, third, and attic floors that face north and south. The roof of the central tower contains a stone chimney.

=== Chapel ===

The Green-Wood Cemetery chapel is located near the 25th Street gate. Built in 1911–1913 by Warren and Wetmore, the chapel is located on the site of one of Green-Wood&#x27;s original ponds. Though it is generally designed in the late Gothic style, its massing is in the Beaux-Arts style. It is made of limestone, and consists of multiple towers, including a central octagonal tower and four octagonal turrets, one at each corner. The three-story chapel contains a ground level, clerestory level, and the second story in the central tower. It was patterned after the Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford.

Plans for the Green-Wood chapel date to shortly after the chapel&#x27;s establishment, when a &quot;Chapel Hill&quot; was set aside within the cemetery. Though Richard Upjohn submitted plans for such a chapel in 1855, Green-Wood initially voted against such a chapel. A new location was selected near Arbor Water in the first decade of the 20th century, and plans were solicited from three firms in 1909. After Warren and Wetmore were selected, work started in 1911, and the chapel was officially opened in June 1913. The chapel was made a city landmark in 2016.

== History ==
=== Founding and construction ===

Following the founding of Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts in 1831, the leaders of New York City and the then-independent city of Brooklyn began discussing locations for a cemetery of their own. At the time, over 10,000 people were being buried per year in the two cities. The cemetery was the idea of Henry Evelyn Pierrepont, a Brooklyn social leader. As early as 1832, Pierrepont was considering constructing such a cemetery on a hilly area to the east of Gowanus Bay. Acts of incorporation for &quot;The Greenwood Cemetery&quot; were passed on April 18, 1838, entitling the corporation to a capital of $300,000 and the right to of land. David Bates Douglass, Green-Wood&#x27;s landscape architect, started working on the layout in 1838. He opposed an early suggestion to call the cemetery a necropolis, as he thought the landscaped site should also attract the living.

On April 11, 1839, a modification to that act was enacted, changing the corporation to a nonprofit organization. Construction started in May 1839 and the first interment was performed on September 5, 1840. At that point, the cemetery commissioners decided to enclose the site with a long picket fence (later replaced with a metal fence in 1860). Douglass mostly kept the cemetery&#x27;s natural landscaping intact, working on the project until he resigned in 1841. Douglass modeled his two subsequently designed garden cemeteries upon Green-Wood: Albany Rural Cemetery (1845–1846), located in Menands, New York, and Mount Hermon Cemetery (1848), in Quebec City. Initially some of roads were paved inside Green-Wood to showcase its natural scenery. The earliest map dating from 1846 indicates that there were originally three ponds in Green-Wood: Sylvan Water, Green-Isle Water, and Arbor Water, all on the western side of the modern cemetery.

There were initially very few burials per year; by 1843, there had been 352 burials total, though the number of burials doubled just in the next year. Throughout the 1840s, several churches were allocated plots in Green-Wood Cemetery. These included the
Dutch Protestant Reformed, Episcopal, Presbyterian, Unitarian, and German Lutheran churches of Brooklyn. By the 1850s, various fauna were being introduced to the cemetery.

=== Expansion and growing popularity ===
==== 1840s to 1860s ====
As early as the 1840s, the cemetery had 30,000 visitors per season during the spring and fall; the visitors took horse-drawn carriages or ferries to the cemetery. To accommodate those who came to the cemetery, a ferry service to the cemetery was established in 1846. The burial ground was expanded multiple times. Originally 175 acres were enclosed, stretching between 21st and 37th Streets from 5th to 9th Avenue. The first additional acquisition in 1847 was for at the southwest corner of the cemetery, adjacent to the contemporary border of the city of Brooklyn. Another to the east was acquired in 1852 through the annexation of land in the then-separate village of Flatbush. Finally, in 1858 another was acquired at the southeastern corner of the cemetery grounds. A plot at the southeast corner of the cemetery was purchased in 1863, allowing the commissioners to straighten out that border.

This era was also associated with the construction of other structures. A receiving tomb was installed in 1853, and around the same time, the ponds were cleaned and landscaped. In addition, several gates to the cemetery were added. The main gate at 5th Avenue and 25th Street was built in 1861–65, followed by other entrances near the cemetery&#x27;s service yard; at 9th Avenue and 20th Street; and at 9th Avenue and 37th Street (later removed). In addition, a gatekeeper&#x27;s house was installed at the original southern entrance in 1848, the &quot;Thirty Vaults&quot; catacombs in 1854, and a well house in 1855. Furthermore, the paths were paved in the 1860s to allow for easier transport within the cemetery. Several additional ponds were carved out through the 1870s, including Border Water, Dell Water, Crescent Water, Dale Water, and Meadow Water.

At first, lots were being sold for $100 apiece, and it soon became a frequent place for burials, with 7,000 annual burials and 100,000 graves by the 1860s. Green-Wood became more popular after former governor DeWitt Clinton was disinterred from a cemetery in Albany, the New York state capital, and moved to Green-Wood, where a monument to him was erected in 1853. By the early 1860s it was drawing annual crowds second in size only to Niagara Falls. Numerous guides to the cemetery were published for these visitors, including an illustrated guidebook and a directory in the late 1840s, as well as a cemetery history and a handbook in the late 1860s.

==== 1870s to 1890s ====

By the 1860s, Prospect Park was being constructed and public streetcar and elevated lines were established across Brooklyn. In particular, the opening of the Fifth Avenue Elevated station at 25th Street, near the main entrance, proved to be a benefit to lot owners in Green-Wood Cemetery. As a result, in 1876, Green-Wood built the Fort Hamilton gate to accommodate the anticipated extra crowds. By the end of the 19th century, several florists, greenhouses, and monument sellers had opened shops near each of the gates. One such structure was the Weir Greenhouse, located across from the 25th Street entrance; that building is now both a National Register of Historic Places listing and a city landmark.

Improvements also continued throughout the late 19th century. In 1871, Border Water was partially eliminated to make extra burial space, and in 1874, the cemetery was slightly expanded to . Also, an underground drainage system, extra roads, and a permanent stone fence were built through the late 1870s. The cemetery was enlarged again in 1884 to via the acquisition of land on the northern border. To prevent the view being marred by the construction of tenements, Green-Wood also purchased lots on the southwest corner. By the 1890s, a reservoir was added atop Mt. Washington, the highest point in the cemetery, while two ponds had been removed. At the turn of the century, an old engine house, stables, and several enclosures were being removed, while waiting rooms and restrooms were added at the southern entrance. During this period, thousands of trees were planted, and roads continued to be graded.

Most famous New Yorkers who died during the second half of the 19th century were buried at Green-Wood. Starting in 1862, free interments were offered to the families of New York soldiers who died in war. In 1868, work started on the installation of the Civil War Soldiers&#x27; Monument at the highest point in Green-Wood to commemorate hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who fought in the war. The monument was not dedicated until 1876. On December 5, 1876, the Brooklyn Theater Fire claimed the lives of at least 278 individuals, with some accounts reporting over 300 dead. Out of that total, 103 unidentified victims were interred in a common grave at Green-Wood Cemetery. An obelisk near the main entrance marks the burial site.

=== 20th century ===
Green-Wood has remained non-sectarian, but was generally considered a Christian burial place for white Anglo-Saxon Protestants of good repute. One early regulation was that no one executed for a crime, or even dying in jail, could be buried there. However, the family of infamous political leader &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed managed to circumvent this rule even though he died in the Ludlow Street Jail. The cemetery&#x27;s chapel was completed in 1913 by Warren and Wetmore, on the site of Arbor Water. By 1916, the cemetery had 325,000 burials.

Modifications to Green-Wood&#x27;s landscape continued through the 20th century. In 1915, the entrance at 20th Street was realigned to connect with 9th Avenue/Prospect Park West (the entrance there being completed in 1926), and another pond was drained. The landscape was in decline by the late 1910s, but this was followed shortly after by dead-tree removals in the 1920s and a five-year road repaving project began in 1924. Road reconstructions continued through the mid-1930s and demolition of enclosures continued. Notably, the clock tower at the 34th Street entrance was demolished in 1941, and iron fences were removed during World War II for the war effort. The old main entrance was demolished in 1951, and four years later, the first new crematorium in New York City in a half-century was built at Green-Wood, with a columbarium. By the end of the 1950s, another reservoir had been filled for new lots.

More than 1,000 enclosures were removed from 1950 to 1961, the same year that work on a new crematorium began. The columbarium was expanded from 1975 to 1977. However, through the 1970s, vandalism was common at Green-Wood Cemetery. The cemetery was also affected by labor strikes among the gravediggers in 1966, 1973, and 1982. The cemetery also continued to add new structures: the Garden Mausoleum and Community Mausoleum were finished in the late 1980s, and the Hillside Mausoleum was expanded. In addition, in 1994, the north gate was restored and new offices were built. This was followed by the restoration of the chapel in the late 1990s, and it reopened in 2000 after having been closed for four decades.

=== 21st century ===

In 1999, The Green-Wood Historic Fund, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution, was created to continue preservation, beautification, educational programs and community outreach as the current &quot;working cemetery&quot; evolves into a Brooklyn cultural institution. The Historic Fund&#x27;s Civil War Project, an effort to identify and remember Civil War veterans buried at Green-Wood, was created following the rededication ceremony of the Civil War Soldiers&#x27; Monument. These early graves had either sunk into the soil, been damaged, or had their markers erased before the monument was restored between 2000 and 2002. Further, construction of the last phase of the Hillside Mausoleum began in 2001, and the same year 50 victims of the September 11 attacks were buried there. By 2009, there was little space for new interments at Green-Wood Cemetery. In December 2010, a memorial was unveiled for the 134 victims of the 1960 New York mid-air collision; the cemetery contains the common grave in which were placed the remains of unidentified victims .

On October 13, 2012, another &quot;Angel of Music&quot; was installed to replace the one vandalized in 1959, this one made by sculptors Giancarlo Biagi and Jill Burkee, was unveiled to memorialize Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Two weeks later, Hurricane Sandy toppled or damaged at least 292 of the mature trees, 210 gravestones, and 2 mausoleums in the cemetery. The damage was estimated at $500,000. In December 2012 the statue &quot;The Triumph of Civic Virtue&quot; by Frederick MacMonnies was moved to Green-Wood. In August 2013, in partnership with the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati, signage in the Battle Hill area of the cemetery was updated to reflect new research on Battle Hill&#x27;s importance in the Battle of Brooklyn.

== Notable burials ==

Green-Wood Cemetery&#x27;s interments include a considerable number of notable people, including painter George Catlin, designer Louis Comfort Tiffany, painter Asher B. Durand, printmakers Nathaniel Currier and James Ives, and architects James Renwick Jr. and Richard Upjohn are among the artists interred in the cemetery. In addition, public leaders William M. Tweed, Henry Ward Beecher, Horace Greeley, William Oland Bourne, and DeWitt Clinton; businessmen Edward R. Squibb, William Colgate, Frederick August Otto Schwarz, and Charles Pfizer; and railroad promoter Thomas C. Durant are buried in the cemetery. Among the burials at the cemetery are six British Commonwealth service personnel whose graves are registered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, three from World War I and three from World War II. There are other notable burials like the economist Henry George; Charles Ebbets; artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, conductor Leonard Bernstein; rapper Bashar Barakah &quot;Pop Smoke&quot; Jackson; physician J. Marion Sims; poets Phoebe Cary and Alice Cary; and actor Frank Morgan.

== Landmark designations ==
The gates of the cemetery were designated a New York City landmark in 1966, and the Weir Greenhouse, used as a visitor&#x27;s center, was designated as such in 1982. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 and was granted National Historic Landmark status in 2006 by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Fort Hamilton Parkway Gate and the cemetery&#x27;s chapel were designated as official New York City landmarks in 2016.

<doc id="165918" wikidata="Q224565" url="?curid=165918" title="311 (band)">
<text>311 (pronounced &quot;three eleven&quot;) is an American rock band from Omaha, Nebraska. The band was formed in 1988 by vocalist and guitarist Nick Hexum, lead guitarist Jim Watson, bassist Aaron &quot;P-Nut&quot; Wills, and drummer Chad Sexton. Watson was replaced by Tim Mahoney in 1990. In 1992, Doug &quot;SA&quot; Martinez joined as a second vocalist and turntablist.

311 has released fourteen studio albums, two live albums, four compilation albums, four EPs and four DVDs. After a series of independent releases, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records in 1992 and released the albums &quot;Music&quot; (1993) and &quot;Grassroots&quot; (1994) to moderate success. They achieved greater success with their 1995 triple platinum self-titled album, which reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on the strength of the singles &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;All Mixed Up&quot;, the former of which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 1996. The band&#x27;s next three albums—&quot;Transistor&quot; (1997), &quot;Soundsystem&quot; (1999), and &quot;From Chaos&quot; (2001)—were also successful, with the first going platinum and the last two going gold. Their 2004 compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits &#x27;93–&#x27;03&quot; was also certified platinum. The band&#x27;s latest studio album is 2024&#x27;s &quot;Full Bloom&quot;. By 2022, 311 had sold over 10 million records in the United States.

The band&#x27;s name was chosen by Wills from the police code for indecent exposure in Omaha after a friend of the band was arrested and cited for skinny dipping in a public pool.

==History==
===Early recordings (1988–1992)===
311&#x27;s first independent release was the &quot;Downstairs&quot; EP, which was recorded in 1989 in Nick Hexum&#x27;s basement. Unlike many of their releases, it had no cover art. It features the song &quot;Feels So Good,&quot; which was recreated/remastered in the album &quot;Music&quot; and is a staple of most of 311&#x27;s live shows.

In 1990, 311 produced 300 cassettes of their second independent release, &quot;Dammit!&quot;, recorded at IEV Studios in Papillion, Nebraska.

In 1991, Tim Mahoney replaced Jim Watson on guitar and 311 released their third independent release, &quot;Unity&quot;, recorded at Rainbow Recording Studios in Omaha. 1000 CDs and 500 cassettes of Unity were printed; they were distributed through consignment and sold at shows. The band began to headline shows in local clubs, such as the Ranch Bowl and Sokol Auditorium.

In 1992, Doug &quot;SA&quot; Martinez, whose nickname stands for Spooky Apparition and who had been making various appearances with 311 over the past years as a vocalist, was officially asked to join the band. 311 recorded a six-track demo, called &quot;Hydroponic&quot;, also recorded at Rainbow Recording Studios, and moved to Los Angeles. Within their first few months, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records.

===&quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Grassroots&quot; (1993–1994)===
Their first major record, &quot;Music&quot;, was released in 1993. The single &quot;Do You Right&quot; received airplay on modern rock stations and reached No. 27 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, the album failed to chart at the time. The album was produced by Eddy Offord, who famously produced Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.

Financing their own tour, the band drove around in an old RV borrowed from Sexton&#x27;s father and towed a Volkswagen bus which held their equipment. After tackling a steep incline while en route to an Omaha show, the RV caught fire. The only door out of the vehicle was surrounded by flames so the band jumped through the fire. All of their equipment and possessions were lost, though no one was seriously injured. The band continued their tour using borrowed equipment.

The following year, they released their second studio album, &quot;Grassroots&quot;.

===Mainstream breakthrough (1995–2001)===
In 1995, 311 released the self-titled &quot;311&quot; (colloquially known as &quot;The Blue Album&quot;). Produced by Ron St. Germain, the album was recorded live in contrast to their previous two albums in which all instruments were recorded separately. The first single &quot;Don&#x27;t Stay Home&quot; was a modest success, reaching No. 29 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart. But the follow-up single &quot;Down&quot;, which was released 14 months after the album, received heavy airplay on mainstream radio, and the accompanying music video was on MTV&#x27;s rotation. The song hit No. 1 on the Modern Rock chart. The band made their network television debut on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on August 23, 1995. The third single, &quot;All Mixed Up&quot;, enjoyed almost identical success, reaching No. 4 on the Modern Rock chart. They also appeared on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; playing &quot;Down&quot;.

In the following years, 311 continued touring and on August 5, 1997, they released &quot;Transistor,&quot; which debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their highest position on that chart. The album went platinum.

In 1998, 311 released &quot;Live&quot;, a live album from a 1997 performance in New Orleans, Louisiana. 311 also released &quot;Omaha Sessions&quot;, a compilation album from their early independent releases.

In 1999, 311 released their fifth major album, &quot;Soundsystem&quot;. The song &quot;Come Original&quot; reached No. 6 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single, &quot;Flowing&quot;, featured &quot;American Pie&#x27;s&quot; Eddie Kaye Thomas in the music video.

Since 2000, the band has recorded every album at the Hive, a North Hollywood, California, recording studio they purchased in 1995. The sessions for &quot;From Chaos&quot;, 311&#x27;s sixth major record release, were the first to be held there. &quot;From Chaos&quot; was released in late 2001. Its first single, &quot;You Wouldn&#x27;t Believe&quot; featured basketball star Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in the video.

===&quot;Evolver&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; (2002–2006)===
311&#x27;s seventh major release, &quot;Evolver&quot; (produced By Ron Saint Germain), came out in 2003. In summer 2003, 311 launched their inaugural Unity Tour. The tour included openers G. Love &amp; Special Sauce, OAR, and Something Corporate.

In 2004, 311&#x27;s cover of The Cure&#x27;s &quot;Love Song&quot; became a No. 1 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It also reached No. 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, their first single to reach that chart. It was featured on the soundtrack for the motion picture &quot;50 First Dates&quot; and then a few months later on their own &quot;Greatest Hits &#x27;93-&#x27;03&quot;. The compilation featured two new songs: &quot;How Do You Feel?&quot; and &quot;First Straw&quot;.

In summer 2004, 311 played a free show at a city park in Omaha for the city&#x27;s 175th Anniversary Celebration. The band changed all marijuana-related lyrics in the songs they played for the appearance. Later that summer, then the band kicked off their second annual Unity Tour with openers The Roots and Medeski Martin &amp; Wood.

On August 16, 2005, 311 released their eighth studio album, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me,&quot; the first single, reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart and No. 7 at Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles.

In mid-2005, 311 kicked off their third annual Unity Tour with openers Papa Roach and Unwritten Law.

On July 20, 2006, 311 kicked off their Summer Unity Tour, playing 37 shows in 27 states and featuring opening bands Pepper and Wailers. After completion of the tour, 311 announced they would be taking a break from recording.

===&quot;Uplifter&quot; and &quot;Universal Pulse&quot; (2007–2011)===
In January 2007, 311 stepped back into their Hive Studios with Nick&#x27;s younger brother Zack Hexum. They recorded a cover of Toots &amp; the Maytals song &quot;Reggae Got Soul&quot; for the soundtrack from the film &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, which was released on June 5, 2007.

Their Summer Unity Tour in 2007 included supporting acts Matisyahu and The English Beat. In 2008, they featured opening acts Snoop Dogg and Fiction Plane.

&quot;Uplifter&quot;, 311&#x27;s ninth studio album, was released on June 2, 2009. The album, produced at 311&#x27;s Hive Recording Studios in Los Angeles by Bob Rock, debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest chart position in the U.S. to date. The band followed up the release of the album with tours in Summer and Fall 2009. They have completed their Spring 2010 tour, which included 311 Day 2010, held in Las Vegas, Nevada. A Summer tour with The Offspring began in June 2010. 311 also held a 2010 fall tour.

2009&#x27;s Summer Unity Tour featured opening acts Ziggy Marley and The Expendables, and 2010&#x27;s featured supporting act The Offspring and opening act Pepper.

In early 2011, 311 finished recording their tenth studio album called &quot;Universal Pulse&quot; at the Hive in Los Angeles, with producer Bob Rock. The album was released July 19, 2011. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Sunset in July&quot; was released on June 3, 2011. Universal Pulse is their shortest album yet, only having 8 songs.

In 2011, Sublime With Rome and DJ Soulman &amp; DJ Trichrome were the openers on the Unity Tour.

===&quot;Stereolithic&quot;, &quot;Archive&quot; Compilation and &quot;Mosaic&quot; (2012–2017)===
In summer 2012, 311 embarked on their tenth annual Unity Tour with Slightly Stoopid, SOJA, and The Aggrolites.

On August 24, 2012, Doug &quot;SA&quot; Martinez told Phoenix&#x27;s &quot;Up on the Sun&quot; that an eleventh 311 studio album was in the works and planned for release in 2013. However, on July 15, 2013, they announced the album would be released on March 11, 2014, to coincide with 311 Day 2014. The album was produced by Scotch Ralston.

On July 2, 2013, 311 started their eleventh annual Unity Tour with Cypress Hill and G. Love &amp; Special Sauce. The tour ended on August 4, 2013.

&quot;Stereolithic&quot;, the band&#x27;s first independently released studio album since 1991&#x27;s &quot;Unity&quot;, was released on March 11, 2014.

On November 18, 2014, 311 released a live album, &quot;311 with the Unity Orchestra – Live from New Orleans – 311 Day 2014&quot;. The album documents part of the 311 Day 2014 concert wherein the band was accompanied onstage by a symphony orchestra for nine songs.

&quot;311 Archive&quot;, a four-disc compilation album featuring 81 previously unreleased songs, B-sides, and demos, was released on June 30, 2015.

As of February 2016, according to Nick Hexum, 311 was working on a new album, and in February 2017, the band revealed the new album&#x27;s title, Mosaic, on their PledgeMusic update feed. Six song titles were released to the public, &quot;Hey Yo&quot;, &quot;Island Sun&quot;, &quot;Extension&quot;, &quot;Too Much to Think&quot;, &quot;Syntax Error&quot;, and &quot;Too Late&quot;; the first two were debuted at 311 Day 2016. 311 invited their fan base to submit a photo of themselves to be featured on the album artwork. &quot;Mosaic&quot; was released on June 23, 2017, and was met with positive reviews. It was their 12th studio album and their 10th consecutive to debut in the Top 10 of US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It debuted at number six, with 39,000 album-equivalent units, of which 37,000 were pure album sales.

On March 9, 2017, the band released &quot;Too Much to Think&quot;, the first single from &quot;Mosaic&quot;. Following that, 311 released the singles &quot;Too Late&quot; and &quot;Perfect Mistake&quot;

===&quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Full Bloom&quot; (2018–present)===
In 2018, 311 and the Offspring toured together on the Never-Ending Summer tour. That summer, the Offspring released a cover of 311&#x27;s &quot;Down&quot; and 311 released a &quot;reggaefied&quot; cover of the Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Self Esteem&quot;. Hexum states that 311 had &quot;the bulk of an album written&quot; and is working with producer/co-writer John Feldmann of Goldfinger on some tracks. Later that summer, Mahoney confirmed that they were working with both Scotch Ralston and John Feldmann on &quot;Voyager&quot;. &quot;Voyager&quot; was released on July 12, 2019. The documentary &quot;Enlarged to Show Detail 3&quot; was released to theaters for one day only on March 11, 2019.

On March 11, 2020, PRS Guitars asked the band if they were planning to make a new live album or follow-up to &quot;Voyager.&quot; Guitarist Tim Mahoney said, &quot;This year is all about playing live and celebrating 30 years. Although we do have a few blocks of time set aside for new music writing and recording, the soonest for any new release would be 2021.&quot; As part of their 30th anniversary tour, the band was scheduled to co-headline a North American trek with Incubus in the summer of 2020, but it was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On May 16, 2022, P-Nut announced via Twitter that he would be taking a hiatus from the band after they had finished their upcoming tour schedule. On November 30, 2022, P-Nut followed up with an announcement also via Twitter that he would not be taking a hiatus, after having had discussions with the band and having seen support from his family and fans.

On June 7, 2024, 311 premiered the music video for &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get It&quot;, their first new single since 2019. The music video, directed by Brian Bowen Smith, sees Hexum as a bare-knuckle pugilist fighting in an underground arena, reminiscent of the 1999 David Fincher film, Fight Club. Hexum said of the track: &quot;The story behind the lyrics to &#x27;You&#x27;re Gonna Get It&#x27; is going back into the mindset of when we were young, and dumb and doing a lot of crazy stuff. Sometimes getting away with it, sometimes with consequences. And I&#x27;m going in and out of the first person saying to myself, &#x27;get your stuff together! Or else you&#x27;re gonna get it.&#x27;&quot;

On September 18, 2024, 311 announced the release of their 14th studio album, &quot;Full Bloom&quot;, along with its second single, &quot;Need Somebody&quot;. The album was released on October 25, 2024. The band took to Instagram, describing the album as &quot;311 on steroids.&quot;

==311 Day==
On March 11, 2000, 311 began celebrating an unofficial holiday of their own creation called 311 Day. The band chose the date because March 11 is written in the United States as 3/11. Every other year on March 11 between 2000 and 2020, and every year since 2021, the band performs an extended concert for thousands of their fans.

In recent years, 311 Day has been split across two or three days. The 2021 event was held as a livestream, due to COVID-19-related restrictions in effect at the time, and consisted only of the band performing the &quot;Transistor&quot; album in full, while the 2023 event was their first to take place aboard a cruise.

<text>Schwann cells or neurolemmocytes (named after German physiologist Theodor Schwann) are the principal glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Glial cells function to support neurons and in the PNS, also include satellite cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, enteric glia and glia that reside at sensory nerve endings, such as the Pacinian corpuscle. The two types of Schwann cells are myelinating and nonmyelinating. Myelinating Schwann cells wrap around axons of motor and sensory neurons to form the myelin sheath.
The Schwann cell promoter is present in the downstream region of the human dystrophin gene that gives shortened transcript that are again synthesized in a tissue-specific manner.

During the development of the PNS, the regulatory mechanisms of myelination are controlled by feedforward interaction of specific genes, influencing transcriptional cascades and shaping the morphology of the myelinated nerve fibers.

Schwann cells are involved in many important aspects of peripheral nerve biologythe conduction of nervous impulses along axons, nerve development and regeneration, trophic support for neurons, production of the nerve extracellular matrix, modulation of neuromuscular synaptic activity, and presentation of antigens to T-lymphocytes.

Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, Guillain–Barré syndrome (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy type), schwannomatosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and leprosy are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.

==Structure==

Schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres (both myelinated and unmyelinated) alive. In myelinated axons, Schwann cells form the myelin sheath. The sheath is not continuous. Individual myelinating Schwann cells cover about 1 mm of an axonequating to about 1000 Schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon. The gaps between adjacent Schwann cells are called nodes of Ranvier.

9-O-Acetyl GD3 ganglioside is an acetylated glycolipid which is found in the cell membranes of many types of vertebrate cells. During peripheral nerve regeneration, 9-O-acetyl GD3 is expressed by Schwann cells.

==Function==
The vertebrate nervous system relies on the myelin sheath for insulation and as a method of decreasing membrane capacitance in the axon. The action potential jumps from node to node, in a process called saltatory conduction, which can increase conduction velocity up to 10 times, without an increase in axonal diameter. In this sense, Schwann cells are the PNS&#x27;s analogues of the central nervous system&#x27;s oligodendrocytes. However, unlike oligodendrocytes, each myelinating Schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon (see image). This arrangement permits saltatory conduction of action potentials with at the nodes of Ranvier. In this way, myelination greatly increases speed of conduction and saves energy.

Nonmyelinating Schwann cells are involved in maintenance of axons and are crucial for neuronal survival. Some group around smaller axons (External image here) and form Remak bundles.

Myelinating Schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work by spiraling around the axon, sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions. A well-developed Schwann cell is shaped like a rolled-up sheet of paper, with layers of myelin between each coil. The inner layers of the wrapping, which are predominantly membrane material, form the myelin sheath, while the outermost layer of nucleated cytoplasm forms the neurilemma. Only a small volume of residual cytoplasm allows communication between the inner and outer layers. This is seen histologically as the Schmidt-Lantermann incisure.

=== Regeneration ===
Schwann cells are known for their roles in supporting nerve regeneration. Nerves in the PNS consist of many axons myelinated by Schwann cells. If damage occurs to a nerve, the Schwann cells aid in digestion of its axons (phagocytosis). Following this process, the Schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons. This tunnel is known as band of Büngner, a guidance track for the regenerating axons, which behaves like an endoneural tube. The stump of the damaged axon is able to sprout, and those sprouts that grow through the Schwann-cell &quot;tunnel&quot; do so at the rate around 1 mm/day in good conditions. The rate of regeneration decreases with time. Successful axons can, therefore, reconnect with the muscles or organs they previously controlled with the help of Schwann cells, but specificity is not maintained and errors are frequent, especially when long distances are involved. Because of their ability to impact regeneration of axons, Schwann cells have been connected to preferential motor reinnervation, as well. 
If Schwann cells are prevented from associating with axons, the axons die. Regenerating axons will not reach any target unless Schwann cells are there to support them and guide them. They have been shown to be in advance of the growth cones. 
Schwann cells are essential for the maintenance of healthy axons. They produce a variety of factors, including neurotrophins, and also transfer essential molecules across to axons.

== Genetics ==
=== Schwann cell formation ===

==== Sox10 ====
SOX10 is a transcription factor active during embryonic development and abundant evidence indicates that it is essential for the generation of glial lineages from trunk crest cells. When SOX10 is inactivated in mice, satellite glia and Schwann cell precursors fail to develop, though neurons are generated normally without issue. In the absence of SOX10, neural crest cells survive and are free to generate neurons, but glial specification is blocked. SOX10 might influence early glial precursors to respond to neuregulin 1 (see below).

==== Neuregulin 1 ====
Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) acts in a number of ways to both promote the formation and ensure the survival of immature Schwann cells. During embryonic development, NRG1 inhibits the formation of neurons from neural crest cells, instead contributing to neural crest cells being led down a path to gliogenesis. NRG1 signaling is not, however, required for glial differentiation from the neural crest.

NRG1 plays important roles in the development of neural crest derivatives. It is required for neural crest cells to migrate past the site of dorsal root ganglia to find the ventral regions of sympathetic gangliogenesis. It is also an essential axon-derived survival factor and a mitogen for Schwann cell precursors. It is found in the dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons at the point in time that Schwann cell precursors begin to populate spinal nerves and therefore influences Schwann cell survival. In embryonic nerves, the transmembrane III isoform likely is the primary variant of NRG1 responsible for survival signals. In mice that lack the transmembrane III isoform, Schwann cell precursors are eventually eliminated from spinal nerves.

=== Formation of myelin sheath ===

==== P0 ====
Myelin protein zero (P0) is a cell-adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is the major component of peripheral myelin, constituting over 50% of the total protein in the sheath. P0 has been shown to be essential for the formation of compact myelin, as P0 null mutant (P0-) mice showed severely aberrant peripheral myelination. Although myelination of large caliber axons was initiated in P0- mice, the resulting myelin layers were very thin and poorly compacted. Unexpectedly, P0- mice also showed degeneration of both axons and their surround myelin sheaths, suggesting that P0 plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of both myelin formation and the axon with which it is associated. P0- mice developed behavioral deficits around 2 weeks of age when mice began to show signs of slight trembling. Gross incoordination also arose as the animals developed, while trembling became more severe and some older mice developed convulsing behaviors. Despite the array of impaired motor behavior, no paralysis was observed in these animals. P0 is also an important gene expressed early within the Schwann cell lineage, expressed in Schwann cell precursors after differentiating from migrating neural crest cells within the developing embryo.

==== Krox-20 ====

Several important transcription factors are also expressed and involved at various stages in development changing the features on the Schwann cells from an immature to mature state. One indispensable transcription factor expressed during the myelination process is Krox-20. It is a general zinc-finger transcription factor and is expressed in the rhombomeres 3 and 5.

Krox-20 is considered one of the master regulators of PNS myelination and is important in driving transcription of specific structural proteins in the myelin. It has been shown to control a set of genes responsible for interfering with this feature in the axon changing it from a pro-myelinating to myelinating state. In this way, in Krox-20 double knock out mice, it has been recorded that hindbrain segmentation is affected as well as myelination of Schwann cell associated axons. Indeed, in these mice, the Schwann cells are not able to perform their myelination properly as they only wrap their cytoplasmic processes one and half turn around the axon and despite the fact that they still express the early myelin marker, late myelin gene products are absent. In addition, recent studies have also proven the importance of this transcription factor in maintaining the myelination phenotype (and requires the co-expression of Sox 10) as its inactivation leads to dedifferentiation of the Schwann cells.

==Clinical significance==
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT), Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy type), schwannomatosis, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), leprosy, and Zika Virus are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.

===Transplantation===
A number of experimental studies since 2001 have implanted Schwann cells in an attempt to induce remyelination in multiple sclerosis-afflicted patients. In the past two decades, many studies have demonstrated positive results and potential for Schwann cell transplantation as a therapy for spinal cord injury, both in aiding regrowth and myelination of damaged CNS axons. Schwann cell transplants in combination with other therapies such as Chondroitinase ABC have also been shown to be effective in functional recovery from spinal cord injury.

<text>The Moonglows were an American R&amp;B group in the 1950s. Their song &quot;Sincerely&quot; went to number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Juke Box chart.

They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Career==
===Early years===
Fresh from a stint in the U.S. Army, two friends, Harvey Fuqua and Bobby Lester, formed a duo in 1949 in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. In 1951, Fuqua moved to Cleveland and formed the Crazy Sounds with the singers Danny Coggins and Prentiss Barnes. Lester joined them later.

In 1952, while performing at a Cleveland club, the Crazy Sounds auditioned for the club&#x27;s management. They soon got in contact with the radio host Alan Freed, who upon hearing them became the group&#x27;s manager. Freed renamed the group the Moonglows, after his own nickname, Moondog. They signed with Freed&#x27;s Champagne label, but their recordings for the label failed to make the charts. Coggins left the group and was replaced by Alexander Walton, who was sometimes known as Pete Graves or Pete Walton.

In 1953, they recorded for another small label, Chance, but like their Champagne recordings, their records had little success; their cover of Doris Day&#x27;s &quot;Secret Love&quot; was their most successful for Chance. In September 1953, Freed obtained a contract with the New York radio station WINS. His success as a broadcaster and host of the station led to a contract for the Moonglows with Chess Records.

===Success===
Their first Chess single, &quot;Sincerely&quot;, led by Lester, reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and the top 20 of the pop chart. The song was later a crossover success in a cover version by the McGuire Sisters. In 1955, the band picked the guitarist Billy Johnson to be their fifth member after Wayne Bennett left the group following their engagement at the Apollo Theater. That same year, the group had another R&amp;B hit with &quot;Most of All&quot;, followed by a more modest success with &quot;We Go Together&quot; in 1956. Chess issued some of their recordings with the group credited as the Moonlighters.

For most of the Moonglows&#x27; tenure, the lead vocals were split between Lester and Fuqua. Lester preferred doo-wop ballads, whereas Fuqua preferred rock-and-roll songs. The two also recorded vocal duets. Their next hits, in 1956, included &quot;See Saw&quot;, which peaked at number five R&amp;B and number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100, and &quot;When I&#x27;m with You&quot;. which reached number 15 on the R&amp;B chart. In August 1956, the band appeared in one of the first rock-and-roll movies, &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot;, lip-syncing &quot;Over and Over Again&quot; and &quot;I Knew From The Start&quot;.

By December 1956, Fuqua had begun to sing most of the vocal leads. In June 1957, the Moonglows had an R&amp;B hit with their cover of Percy Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Please Send Me Someone to Love&quot;. In late 1958, the Fuqua-led &quot;Ten Commandments of Love&quot; (used in soundtrack of &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;) reached number nine R&amp;B and number 22 pop; the group was billed as Harvey and the Moonglows. Chess released two EPs and an album, &quot;Look, It&#x27;s the Moonglows&quot;, during that period. Following that release, the original group broke up at the end of the year, performing together only for contractual reasons.

===Spinoff groups===
In 1959, Lester began a solo career. That same year, Harvey Fuqua, following the advice of another Chess artist, Bo Diddley, worked with the Marquees, where Fuqua first met Marvin Gaye. Relocating the group from their hometown of Washington, D.C., to Chicago, Fuqua soon brought Chuck Barksdale into the group after Barksdale&#x27;s group, the Dells, was temporarily on a break following a car crash involving one of its members. Fuqua renamed the group Harvey and the New Moonglows. In April 1959, Fuqua sang lead on the ballad &quot;Twelve Months of the Year&quot;, which included a spoken recitation by Gaye, repeating an early trademark of the Moonglows in &quot;Ten Commandments of Love&quot;. Later in 1959, Chess issued the songs &quot;Unemployment&quot; and &quot;Mama Loocie&quot;, which was Gaye&#x27;s first lead vocal. Most of the time, Fuqua recorded solo numbers and often promoted his and the New Moonglows&#x27; songs on TV and in movies. During this time, the group recorded background vocals for the likes of Etta James and Chuck Berry.

Lester later formed his own Moonglows group. In 1959, he made headlines after he was arrested on a narcotics charge in Beaumont, Texas. In early 1960, James Nolan left Fuqua&#x27;s group, as did Reese Palmer. According to Palmer, they left to raise their families. Chuck Barksdale also left to rejoin the revived Dells. In late 1960, Gaye, Chester Simmons and Fuqua recorded (along with, presumably, members of the Spinners) the last New Moonglows recordings, including &quot;Junior&quot; and &quot;Beatnik&quot;. Afterwards, Gaye relocated to Detroit and later signed with Tamla, a subsidiary of Motown Records. In February 1961, Fuqua left Chess and worked on his own Detroit labels, Harvey and Tri-Phi, until he joined Motown&#x27;s production team. He left Motown for RCA in 1970. In 1969, Prentiss Barnes retired from show business after complications of injuries from a car crash.

===Reunion===
In 1970, Harvey Fuqua, Bobby Lester and Pete Graves reunited as the Moonglows with Doc Williams and Chuck Lewis. In 1972, they recorded &quot;Sincerely &#x27;72&quot; for Big P Records. RCA soon bought Big P and reissued &quot;Sincerely &#x27;72&quot;, which reached number 43 on the R&amp;B chart. The album &quot;The Return of the Moonglows&quot; was also released that year. The reunion proved to be short-lived.

===Final years and deaths===
Danny Coggins died On July 27, 1972, due to a heart attack.

Bobby Lester continued to sing lead for his own Moonglows group until he succumbed to complications of cancer in 1980, at the age of 49. He was replaced by Billy McPhatter, son of Clyde McPhatter.

Fuqua performed with Bobby Lester&#x27;s Moonglows at the 1983 Grammy Awards ceremony, and the group toured as Harvey and the Moonglows until 1986. Bobby Lester, Jr., replaced McPhatter as lead singer of Bobby Lester&#x27;s Moonglows.

They also Performed at Doo Wop 50, where they sang Sincerely &amp; Ten Commandments Of Love. The Line-up was Harvey Fuqua, Bruce Martin, Gene Kelley, Peter Crawford, and Gary Rodgers.

Billy Johnson died in Los Angeles on April 28, 1987. 

Chester Simmons died On September 26, 1988.

Gary Rodgers died on June 25, 2005.

Gene Kelley died In 2008

Reese Palmer died on October 27, 2011.

Prentiss Barnes and Pete Graves died in 2006. Fuqua, the last surviving original member of the group, died on July 6, 2010, in Detroit.

==Legacy==
The Moonglows&#x27; singing style is known as &quot;blow&quot; harmony, based on the technical method used by the backing vocalists.

The Moonglows were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.

The group are mentioned in Paul Simon&#x27;s 1983 song &quot;René and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War&quot;.

<doc id="165926" wikidata="Q771404" url="?curid=165926" title="San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge">
<text>The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, commonly referred to as the Bay Bridge, is a complex of bridges spanning San Francisco Bay in California. As part of Interstate 80 and the direct road between San Francisco and Oakland, it carries about 260,000 vehicles a day on its two decks. It includes one of the longest bridge spans in the United States.

The toll bridge was conceived as early as the California gold rush days, with &quot;Emperor&quot; Joshua Norton famously advocating for it, but construction did not begin until 1933. Designed by Charles H. Purcell, and built by American Bridge Company, it opened on Thursday, November 12, 1936, six months before the Golden Gate Bridge. It originally carried automobile traffic on its upper deck, with trucks, cars, buses and commuter trains on the lower, but after the Key System abandoned its rail service on April 20, 1958, the lower deck was converted to all-road traffic as well. On October 12, 1963, traffic was reconfigured to one way traffic on each deck, westbound on the upper deck, and eastbound on the lower deck, with trucks and buses also allowed on the upper deck.

In 1986, the bridge was unofficially dedicated to former California governor James Rolph.

The bridge has two sections of roughly equal length; the older western section, officially known as the Willie L. Brown Jr. Bridge (after former San Francisco Mayor and California State Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr.), connects downtown San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island, and the newer east bay section connects the island to Oakland. The western section is a double suspension bridge with two decks, westbound traffic being carried on the upper deck while eastbound is carried on the lower one. The largest span of the original eastern section was a cantilever bridge.

During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a portion of the eastern section&#x27;s upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck and the bridge was closed for a month. Reconstruction of the eastern section of the bridge as a causeway connected to a self-anchored suspension bridge began in 2002; the new eastern section opened September 2, 2013, at a reported cost of over $6.5 billion; the original estimate of $250 million was for a seismic retrofit of the existing span. Unlike the western section and the original eastern section of the bridge, the new eastern section is a single deck carrying all eastbound and westbound lanes. Demolition of the old east span was completed on September 8, 2018.

==Description==
The bridge consists of two crossings, east and west of Yerba Buena Island, a natural mid-bay outcropping inside San Francisco city limits. The western crossing between Yerba Buena and downtown San Francisco has two complete suspension spans connected at a center anchorage. Rincon Hill is the western anchorage and touch-down for the San Francisco landing of the bridge connected by three shorter truss spans. The eastern crossing, between Yerba Buena Island and Oakland, was a cantilever bridge with a double-tower span, five medium truss spans, and a 14-section truss causeway. Due to earthquake concerns, the eastern crossing was replaced by a new crossing that opened on Labor Day 2013. On Yerba Buena Island, the double-decked crossing is a concrete viaduct east of the west span&#x27;s cable anchorage, the Yerba Buena Tunnel through the island&#x27;s rocky central hill, another concrete viaduct, and a longer curved high-level steel truss viaduct that spans the final to the cantilever bridge.

The toll plaza on the Oakland side (westbound traffic only since 1969) has eighteen toll lanes, with all charges now made either through the FasTrak electronic toll collection system or through invoices mailed through the USPS, based on the license plate of the car per Department of Motor Vehicle records. Metering signals are about west of the toll plaza. Two full-time bus-only lanes bypass the toll booths and metering lights around the right (north) side of the toll plaza; other high occupancy vehicles can use these lanes during weekday morning and afternoon commute periods. The two far-left toll lanes are high-occupancy vehicle lanes during weekday commute periods. Radio and television traffic reports will often refer to congestion at the toll plaza, metering lights, or a parking lot in the median of the road for bridge employees; the parking lot is about long, stretching from about east of the toll plaza to about west of the metering lights.

During the morning commute hours, traffic congestion on the westbound approach from Oakland stretches back through the MacArthur Maze interchange at the east end of the bridge onto the three feeder highways, Interstate 580, Interstate 880, and I-80 toward Richmond. Since the number of lanes on the eastbound approach from San Francisco is structurally restricted, eastbound backups are also frequent during evening commute hours. The eastbound bottleneck is not the bridge itself, but the approach, which has just three lanes in each direction, in contrast to the bridge&#x27;s five.

The western section of the Bay Bridge is currently restricted to motorized freeway traffic. Pedestrians, bicycles, and other non-freeway vehicles are not allowed to cross this section. A project to add bicycle/pedestrian lanes to the western section has been proposed but is not finalized. A Caltrans bicycle shuttle operates between Oakland and San Francisco during peak commute hours for $1.00 each way.

Freeway ramps next to the tunnel provide access to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island. Because the toll plaza is on the Oakland side, the western span is a &quot;de facto&quot; non-tolled bridge; traffic between the island and the main part of San Francisco can freely cross back and forth. Those who only travel from Oakland to Yerba Buena Island, and not the entire length to the main part of San Francisco, still must pay the full toll.

==Early history==

Developed at the entrance to the bay, San Francisco was well placed to prosper during the California Gold Rush. Almost all goods not produced locally arrived by ship, as did numerous travelers and erstwhile miners. But after the first transcontinental railroad was completed in May 1869, San Francisco was on the wrong side of the Bay, and separated from the new rail link.

Many San Franciscans feared that the city would lose its position as the regional center of trade. Businessmen had considered the concept of a bridge spanning the San Francisco Bay since the Gold Rush days. During the 1870s, several newspaper articles explored the idea. In early 1872, a &quot;Bay Bridge Committee&quot; was hard at work on plans to construct a railroad bridge. The April 1872 issue of the &quot;San Francisco Real Estate Circular&quot; reported on this committee:

The self-proclaimed Emperor Norton decreed three times in 1872 that a suspension bridge be constructed to connect Oakland with San Francisco. In the third of these decrees, in September 1872, Norton, frustrated that nothing had happened, proclaimed:

Unlike most of Emperor Norton&#x27;s eccentric ideas, his decree to build a bridge had a widespread public and political appeal. Yet the task was too much of an engineering and economic challenge, since the bay was too wide and too deep there. In 1921, more than forty years after Norton&#x27;s death, an underground tube was considered, but it became clear that one would be inadequate for vehicular traffic. Support for a trans-bay crossing increased in the 1920s based on the popularity and availability of automobiles.

===Planning===
The California State Legislature and governor enacted a law, effective in 1929, to establish the California Toll Bridge Authority (Stats. 1929, Chap 763) and to authorize it and the State Department of Public Works to build a bridge connecting San Francisco and Alameda County (Stats. 1929, Chap 762).

The state appointed a commission to evaluate the idea and various designs for a bridge across the Bay, the Hoover-Young Commission. Its conclusions were made public in 1930.

In January 1931, Charles H. Purcell, the State Highway Engineer of California, who had also served as the secretary of the Hoover-Young Commission, assumed the position of Chief Engineer for the Bay Bridge. Glenn B. Woodruff served as design engineer for the project. He explained in a 1936 article that several elements of the bridge required not only new designs, but also new theories of design.

To make the bridge feasible, a route was chosen via Yerba Buena Island, which would reduce both the material and the labor needed. Since Yerba Buena Island was a U.S. Navy base at the time, the state had to gain approval from Congress for this purpose as it regulates and controls all federal lands and the armed services. After a great deal of lobbying, California received Congressional approval to use the island on February 20, 1931, subject to final approvals by the Departments of War, Navy, and Commerce. The state applied for permits from the 3 federal departments as required. The permits were granted in January 1932, and formally presented in a ceremony on Yerba Buena Island on February 24, 1932.

On May 25, 1931, Governor James Rolph Jr. signed into law two acts: one providing for the financing of state bridges by revenue bonds, and another creating the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge Division of the State Department of Public Works. On September 15, 1931, this new division opened its offices at 500 Sansome Street in San Francisco.

During 1931, numerous aerial photographs were taken of the chosen route for the bridge and its approaches.

That year, engineers had not determined the final design concept for the western span between San Francisco and Yerba Buena Island, although the idea of a double-span suspension bridge was already favored.

In April 1932, the preliminary final plan and design of the bridge was presented by Chief Engineer Charles Purcell to Col. Walter E. Garrison, Director of the State Department of Public Works, and to Ralph Modjeski, head of the Board of Engineering Consultants. Both agencies approved and preparation of the final design proceeded. In 1932, Joseph R. Knowland, a former U.S. Congressman from California, traveled to Washington to help persuade President Herbert Hoover and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to advance $62 million to build the bridge.

===Construction===
Before work began, 12 massive underwater telephone cables were moved of the proposed bridge route by crews of the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co. during the summer of 1931.

Construction began on July 9, 1933 after a groundbreaking ceremony attended by former president Herbert Hoover, dignitaries, and local beauty queens.

The western section of the bridge between San Francisco and Yerba Buena Island presented an enormous engineering challenge. The bay was up to deep in places and the soil required new foundation-laying techniques. A single main suspension span some in length was considered but rejected, as it would have required too much fill and reduced wharfage space at San Francisco, had less vertical clearance for shipping, and cost more than the design ultimately adopted. The solution was to construct a massive concrete anchorage halfway between San Francisco and the island, and to build a main suspension span on each side of this central anchorage.

East of Yerba Buena Island, the bay to Oakland was spanned by a combination of double cantilever, five long-span through-trusses, and a truss causeway, forming the longest bridge of its kind at the time. The cantilever section was longest in the nation and third-longest anywhere.

Much of the original eastern section was founded upon treated wood pilings. Because of the very deep mud on the bay bottom, it was not practical to reach bedrock, although the lower levels of the mud are quite firm. Long wooden pilings were crafted from entire old-growth Douglas fir trees, which were driven through the soft mud to the firmer bottom layers. The construction project had casualties: twenty-four men would die while constructing the bridge.

===Yerba Buena Tunnel===

California Department of Transportation engineer C.H. Purcell served as chief engineer for the Bay Bridge, including the construction of the Yerba Buena Tunnel. Before starting excavation, the ground through which the western half of the tunnel would be bored was stabilized by injecting cement grout under pressure through 25 holes bored into the loose rock over the crown of the tunnel.

After excavating the western and eastern open portals, three drifts were bored from west to east along the path of the tunnel: one at the crown and the other two at the lower corners. The first drift broke through in July 1934, approximately one year after the start of construction. A ceremonial party led by Governor Merriam celebrated the completion of the first drift on July 24 by walking through it, followed by a short speech. The space between the three drifts was then excavated, resulting in a single arch-shaped bore (in cross-section), and the tunnel roof was constructed using steel I-beam ribs spaced apart to support the rock, which were then embedded in concrete up to thick at the crown. No cave-ins occurred during the excavation of the tunnel.

After the roof was completed, the remaining core of rock between the tunnel roof and lower deck was excavated using a power shovel. By May 1935, work on removing the core was progressing and 40 steel ribs had been placed; concrete embedment was just starting. Removal of the core was completed on November 18, 1935. Once the excavation was complete, the upper deck was placed and the interior ceiling above the upper deck was lined with tiles. The last concrete poured during the construction of the Bay Bridge was part of the upper deck lining in late summer 1936. This included the emplacement of regularly spaced refuge bays (&quot;deadman holes&quot;) along the south wall of the lower deck tunnel, escape alcoves common in all railway tunnels into which track maintenance workers could duck if a train came along. These remain and are visible to eastbound motorists today.

The completed tunnel bore is wide and high overall, and the dimensions of the tunnel interior are wide and high. In 1936, it was hailed as the world&#x27;s largest-bore tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;dot.ca.gov/trivia&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The cross-sectional area of the upper half is , and the lower half is .

Reminders of the long-gone bridge railway survive along the south side of the lower Yerba Buena Tunnel. These are the regularly spaced refuge bays (&quot;deadman holes&quot;), escape alcoves common in all railway tunnels, along the wall, into which track maintenance workers could safely retreat if a train came along. (The north side, which always carried only motor traffic, lacks these holes.)

The tunnel is wide, high, and long. It is the largest diameter transportation bore tunnel in the world. The large amount of material that was excavated in boring the tunnel was used for a portion of the landfill over the shoals lying adjacent to Yerba Buena Island to its north, a project which created the artificial Treasure Island. The contract to build the Yerba Buena Cable Anchorage, Tunnel &amp; Viaduct segment was opened for bids on March 28, 1933, and awarded to the low bidder, Clinton Construction Company of California, for $1,821,129.50 (equivalent to $ in ). Yerba Buena Island was the main site of the official groundbreaking for the Bay Bridge on July 9, 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt remotely set off a dynamite blast on the eastern side of the island at 12:58 p.m. local time. Former President Herbert Hoover and Governor James Rolph were onsite; the two men were the first to turn over the earth with ceremonial golden spades. Other ceremonies took place simultaneously in San Francisco (on Rincon Hill) and Oakland Harbor.

The Yerba Buena Tunnel opened, along with the rest of the Bay Bridge, on November 12, 1936. the tunnel lacks an official name.

==Opening day==
The bridge opened on November 12, 1936, at 12:30 p.m. In attendance were the former US president Herbert Hoover, Senator William G. McAdoo, and the Governor of California, Frank Merriam. Governor Merriam opened the bridge by cutting gold chains across it with an acetylene cutting torch. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; report of November 13, 1936, read:


The total cost was US$77 million (equivalent to $ in ). Before opening the bridge was blessed by Cardinal Secretary of State Eugene Cardinal Pacelli, later Pope Pius XII. Because it was in effect two bridges strung together, the western spans were ranked the second and third largest suspension bridges. Only the George Washington Bridge had a longer span between towers.

As part of the celebration a United States commemorative coin was produced by the San Francisco Mint. A half dollar, the obverse portrays California&#x27;s symbol, the grizzly bear, while the reverse presents a picture of the bridge spanning the bay. A total of 71,369 coins were sold, some from the bridge&#x27;s tollbooths.

== Post-opening history ==
===1930s–1960s===
====The Bridge Railway====

Construction of the Bridge Railway began on November 29, 1937, with the laying of the first ties. The first train was run across the Bay Bridge on September 23, 1938, a test run utilizing a Key System train consisting of two articulated units with California Governor Frank Merriam at the controls. On January 14, 1939, the San Francisco Transbay Terminal was dedicated. The following morning, January 15, 1939, the electric interurban trains started in revenue service, running along the south side of the lower deck of the bridge. The terminal originally was supposed to open at the same time as the Bay Bridge, but had been delayed.

Trains over the Bridge Railway were operated by the Sacramento Northern Railroad (Western Pacific), the Interurban Electric Railway (Southern Pacific) and the Key System. Freight trains never used the bridge. The tracks left the lower deck in San Francisco just southwest of the end of 1st St. They then went along an elevated viaduct above city streets, looping around and into the terminal on its east end. Departing trains exited on the loop back onto the bridge. The loop continued to be used by buses until the terminal&#x27;s closure in 2010. The tracks left the lower deck in Oakland. The Interurban Electric Railway tracks ran along Engineer Road and over the Southern Pacific yard on trestles (some of it is still standing and visible from nearby roadways) onto the streets and dedicated right-of-ways in Berkeley, Albany, Oakland and Alameda. The Sacramento Northern and Key System tracks went under the SP tracks through a tunnel (which still exists and is in use as an access to the EBMUD treatment plant) and onto 40th St. Due to falling ridership, Sacramento Northern and IER service ended in 1941.
On September 13, 1942, a stop was opened at Yerba Buena Island to serve expanded wartime needs on adjacent Treasure Island.

Despite the vital role the railroad played, the last train went over the bridge in April 1958. The tracks were removed and replaced with pavement on the Transbay Terminal ramps and Bay Bridge. The Key System handled buses over the bridge until 1960 when its successor, AC Transit, took over operations. It still handles service today, running to a new transbay terminal located in the same vicinity in San Francisco, the Salesforce Transit Center.

====Emperor Norton plaque and relocation====
In 1872, the San Francisco entrepreneur and eccentric Emperor Norton issued three proclamations calling for the design and construction of a suspension bridge between San Francisco and Oakland via Yerba Buena Island (formerly Goat Island). A 1939 plaque honoring Emperor Norton for the original idea for the Bay Bridge was dedicated by the fraternal society E Clampus Vitus and was installed at The Cliff House in February 1955. In November 1986, in connection with the bridge&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the plaque was moved to the Transbay Terminal, the public transit and Greyhound bus depot at the west end of the bridge in downtown San Francisco. When the terminal was closed in 2010, the plaque was placed in storage.

=== 1960s–2010s ===

==== Roadway retrofit ====
Until the 1960s, the upper deck ( wide between curbs) carried three lanes of traffic in each direction and was restricted to automobiles only. The lower deck carried three lanes of truck and bus traffic, with autos allowed, on the north side of the bridge. In the 1950s traffic lights were added to set the direction of travel in the middle lane, but there still remained no divider. Two interurban railroad tracks on the south half of the lower deck carried the electric commuter trains. In 1958 the tracks were replaced with pavement, but the reconfiguration to what the traffic eventually became did not take place until 1963.

The Federal highway on the bridge was originally a concurrency of U.S. Highway 40 and U.S. Highway 50. The bridge was re-designated as Interstate 80 in 1964, and the western ends of U.S. 40 and U.S. 50 are now in Silver Summit, Utah, and West Sacramento, California, respectively.
==== Reconstruction of approaches ====
The original western approach to (and exit from) the upper deck of the bridge was a long ramp to Fifth Street, branching to Harrison St for westward traffic off the bridge and Bryant St for eastward traffic entering. There was also an on-ramp to the upper deck on Rincon Hill from Fremont Street (which later became an off-ramp) and an off-ramp to First Street (later extended over First St to Fremont St). The lower deck ended at Essex and Harrison St; just southwest of there, the tracks of the bridge railway left the lower deck and curved northward into the elevated loop through the Transbay Terminal that was paved for buses after rail service ended.

The eastern approach to the bridge included a causeway landing for the &quot;incline&quot; section, and the construction of three feeder highways, interlinked by an extensive interchange, which in later years became known as &quot;The MacArthur Maze&quot;. A massive landfill was emplaced, extending along the north edge of the existing Key System rail mole to the existing bayshore, and continuing northward along the shore to the foot of Ashby Avenue in Berkeley. The fill was continued northward to the foot of University Avenue as a causeway which enclosed an artificial lagoon, subsequently developed by the WPA as &quot;Aquatic Park&quot;. The three feeder highways were U.S. Highway 40 (Eastshore Highway) which led north through Berkeley, U.S. Highway 50 (38th Street, later MacArthur Blvd.) which led through Oakland, and State Route 17 which ran parallel to U.S. 50, along the Oakland Estuary and through the industrial and port sections of the city.

The current approaches were constructed in the 1960s, as the original ones were not up to interstate highway standards and were designed mainly for local use.

==== Yerba Buena Tunnel Reconstruction ====
As originally completed, the upper deck was reserved for automobile traffic, and carried six lanes, each wide. The lower deck was further divided into three lanes of traffic for heavy trucks (each wide), and the two railroad tracks on the south side ( wide for both tracks). The initial design in 1932 called for the two rail tracks to flank a central truck deck on the lower level. After Key System trains stopped running over the bridge in 1958, bids were opened on October 11, 1960, to rebuild the tunnel. The rebuild consisted of multiple stages of work:
# Remove Key System rails, lower rail deck and repave
# Lower the truck traffic half of the lower deck by and repave
# Remove center columns supporting upper deck
# Lower the upper deck by by placing precast concrete units

After the reconstruction, the tunnel would handle only road traffic. The upper deck was lowered to accommodate heavy truck traffic, as each deck would now carry five lanes of unidirectional traffic. The upper deck was dedicated to westbound traffic, and the lower deck was dedicated to eastbound traffic. The impact to traffic during reconstruction of the tunnel was minimized mainly by working outside normal commuting hours and through the use of a portable steel bridge long and wide, designed to fit between the curbs of the existing upper deck. The bridge spanned the gap between the new upper deck and old upper deck, and the overall elevation change of caused drivers to slow to , resulting in traffic jams. The first accident caused by &quot;The Hump&quot;, the nickname the bridge acquired after prominent warning signs advertising its presence, occurred just twelve minutes after it was first deployed on November 25, 1961.

The new precast upper deck units were each long, and were installed in two halves. One side of each half rested on a temporary falsework erected in the middle of the lower deck, and the other side rested on the shoulder of the tunnel wall previously used to support the old upper deck. After the two halves were fastened together, a steel form was used to close the gap between halves, and concrete was poured in the gap. The upper deck rests on shoulders built into the tunnel wall, padded by Masonite.

The planned completion date for tunnel reconstruction was July 1962, but &quot;The Hump&quot; was not dismantled until October 27, 1962. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; marked the occasion by quipping &quot;[The Hump] produced more jams than Grandma ever made.&quot; After reconstruction, both the upper and lower decks featured of vertical clearance. Upper deck clearance is restricted by the tunnel portal, and lower deck clearance is restricted by the upper deck.

==== Rail removal ====

Automobile traffic increased dramatically in the ensuing decades of the bridge&#x27;s opening. This, among other things, resulted in the Key Systems decline, and by the 1960s having rails on the bridge had become obsolete and a detriment to traffic, as they carried nothing on them. Work began on removing the tracks in October 1963. After the work was completed, the Bay Bridge was reconfigured with five lanes of westbound traffic on the upper deck and five lanes of eastbound traffic on the lower deck. The Key System originally planned to end train operations in 1948 when it replaced its streetcars with buses, but Caltrans did not approve of this. Trucks had their ban lifted and were allowed on the top deck for the first time. Due to this, the upper deck was retrofitted to handle the increased loads, with understringers added and prestressing added to the bottom of the floor beams. This retrofit is still in place today, and is visible to Eastbound traffic on the western span.

In current times, there have been attempts to restore rail service to the bridge, but none were successful. A study released in 2000 estimated the cost of restoring rail service across the bridge at up to $8 billion .

====1968 aircraft accident ====
On February 11, 1968, a U.S. Navy training aircraft crashed into the cantilever span of the bridge, killing both reserve officers aboard. The T2V SeaStar, based at NAS Los Alamitos in southern California, was on a routine weekend mission and had just taken off in the fog from nearby NAS Alameda. The plane struck the bridge about above the upper deck roadway and then sank in the bay north of the bridge. There were no injuries among the motorists on the bridge. One of the truss sections of the bridges was replaced due to damage from the impact.

==== 1986 Cable lighting ====
The series of lights adorning the westbound spans suspension cables were added in 1986 as part of the bridge&#x27;s 50th-anniversary celebration.

==== James B. Rolpf Jr. designation ====
The bridge was unofficially &quot;dedicated&quot; to James B. &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; Rolph, Jr., but this was not widely recognized until the bridge&#x27;s 50th-anniversary celebrations in 1986. The official name of the bridge for all functional purposes has always been the &quot;San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge&quot;, and, by most local people, it is referred to simply as &quot;the Bay Bridge&quot;. Rolph, a Mayor of San Francisco from 1912 to 1931, was the Governor of California at the time construction of the bridge began. He died in office on June 2, 1934, two years before the bridge opened, leaving the bridge to be named for him out of respect.

==== 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake and emergency repairs ====
On the evening of October 17, 1989, during the Loma Prieta earthquake, which measured a 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale, a section of the upper deck of the eastern truss portion of the bridge at Pier E9 collapsed onto the deck below, indirectly causing one death. The bridge was closed for just over a month as construction crews repaired the section. That same year, the bridge reopened to traffic on November 18.

==== 2001 terrorism threat ====
On November 2, 2001, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Governor Gray Davis announced a threat of a rush hour attack against a West Coast suspension bridge (a group which includes the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge) some time between November 2 and 7, resulting in an increase of openly armed law enforcement patrols.

A small fraction of drivers shifted to ferries and BART. It was later revealed that crews had secretly been working under armed guard for several weeks to harden the suspension cable attachment points, which were vulnerable to cutting with common weapons and tools. An anchor room was filled with concrete, doors welded shut, and a razor wire fence added. A blast wall was also added to defend against a potential truck bomb. In the end, no attack occurred.

==== Emperor Norton naming campaign ====
In November 2004, after a campaign by &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; cartoonist Phil Frank, then-San Francisco District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin introduced a resolution to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors calling for the entire two-bridge system, from San Francisco to Oakland, to be named for Emperor Norton.

On December 14, 2004, the Board approved a modified version of this resolution, calling for only &quot;new additions&quot;—i.e., the new eastern crossing—to be named &quot;The Emperor Norton Bridge&quot;. Neither the City of Oakland nor Alameda County passed any similar resolution, so the effort went no further.

==== Western span retrofit ====
The western section has undergone extensive seismic retrofitting. During the retrofit, much of the structural steel supporting the bridge deck was replaced while the bridge remained open to traffic. Engineers accomplished this by using methods similar to those employed on the Chicago Skyway.

The entire bridge was fabricated using hot steel rivets, which are impossible to heat treat and so remain relatively soft. Analysis showed that these could fail by shearing under extreme stress. Therefore, at most locations, rivets were replaced with high-strength bolts. Most bolts had domed heads placed facing traffic so they looked similar to the rivets that were removed.. This work had to be performed with great care as the steel of the structure had for many years been painted with lead paint, which had to be carefully removed and contained by workers with extensive protective gear so that they would not suffocate.

Most of the beams were originally constructed of two plate -beams joined with lattices of flat strip or angle stock, depending upon structural requirements. These have all been reconstructed by replacing the riveted lattice elements with bolted steel plate and so converting the lattice beams into box beams. This replacement included adding face plates to the large diagonal beams joining the faces of the main towers, which now have an improved appearance when viewed from certain angles.

Diagonal box beams have been added to each bay of the upper and lower decks of the western spans. These add stiffness to reduce side-to-side motion during an earthquake and reduce the probability of damage to the decking surfaces.

Analysis showed that some massive concrete supports could burst and crumble under likely stresses. In particular the western supports were extensively modified. First, the location of existing reinforcing bar is determined using magnetic techniques. In areas between bars holes are drilled. Into these holes is inserted and glued an L-shaped bar that protrudes . This bar is retained in the hole with a high-strength epoxy adhesive. The entire surface of the structure is thus covered with closely spaced protrusions. A network of horizontal and vertical reinforcing bars is then attached to these protrusions. Mold surface plates are then positioned to retain high-strength concrete, which is then pumped into the void. After removal of the formwork the surface appears similar to the original concrete. This technique has been applied elsewhere throughout California to improve freeway overpass abutments and some overpass central supports that have unconventional shapes. (Other techniques such as &quot;jacket and grout&quot; are applied to simple vertical posts; see the seismic retrofit article.)

The western approaches have also been retrofitted in part, but mostly these have been replaced with new construction of reinforced concrete.

==== 2007 &quot;Cosco Busan&quot; oil spill ====
In 2007, a container ship then named the &quot;Cosco Busan,&quot; and subsequently renamed the &quot;Hanjin Venezia,&quot; collided with the Delta Tower fender, resulting in the &quot;Cosco Busan&quot; oil spill.

==== October 2009 eyebar crack, repair failure and bridge closure ====
During the 2009 Labor Day weekend closure for a portion of the replacement, a major crack was found in an eyebar, significant enough to warrant bridge closure. Working in parallel with the retrofit, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and its contractors and subcontractors, were able to design, engineer, fabricate, and install the pieces required to repair the bridge, delaying its planned opening by only hours. The repair was not inspected by the Federal Highway Administration, which relied on state inspection reports to ensure safety guidelines were met.

On October 27, 2009, during the evening commute, the steel crossbeam and two steel tie rods repaired over Labor Day weekend snapped off the Bay Bridge&#x27;s eastern section and fell to the upper deck. This may have been due to metal-on-metal vibration from bridge traffic and wind gusts of up to , which resulted in one of the rods breaking off and caused one of the metal sections to come crashing down. Three vehicles were either struck by or hit the fallen debris, though there were no injuries. On November 1, Caltrans announced that the bridge would probably stay closed at least through the morning commute of Monday, November 2 after repairs performed during the weekend failed a stress test on Sunday. BART and the Golden Gate Ferry systems added supplemental service to accommodate the increased passenger load during the bridge closure. The bridge reopened to traffic on November 2, 2009.

The pieces that broke off on October 27 were a saddle, crossbars, and two tension rods.

=== 2010s–present ===

==== Willie L. Brown, Jr., Bridge naming resolution ====
In June 2013, nine state assemblymen, joined by two state senators, introduced Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 65 (ACR 65) to name the western crossing of the bridge for former California Assembly Speaker and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. Six weeks later, a grassroots petition was launched seeking to name the entire two-bridge system for Emperor Norton. In September 2013, the petition&#x27;s author launched a nonprofit, The Emperor&#x27;s Bridge Campaign — now known as The Emperor Norton Trust — that advocates for adding &quot;Emperor Norton Bridge&quot; as an honorary name (rather than &quot;renaming&quot; the bridge) and that undertakes other efforts to advance Norton&#x27;s legacy. The state legislative resolution naming the western section of the Bay Bridge the &quot;Willie L. Brown, Jr., Bridge&quot; passed the Assembly in August 2013 and the Senate in September 2013. A ceremony was held on February 11, 2014, marking the resolution and the installation of signs on either end of the section.

==== Eastern span replacement ====

For various reasons, the eastern section would have been too expensive to retrofit compared to replacing it, so the decision was made to replace it.

The replacement section underwent a series of design changes, both progressive and regressive, with increasing cost estimates and contractor bids. The final design included a single-towered self-anchored suspension span starting at Yerba Buena island, leading to a long inclined viaduct to the Oakland touchdown.

Separated and protected bicycle lanes are a visually prominent feature on the south side of the new eastern section. The bikeway and pedestrian path across the eastern span opened in October 2016 and carries recreational and commuter cyclists between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island. The original eastern cantilever span had firefighting dry standpipes installed. No firefighting dry or wet standpipes were designed for the eastern section replacement, although, the firefighting wet standpipes do exist on the original western section visible on both the north-side upper and lower decks.

The original eastern section closed permanently to traffic on August 28, 2013, and the replacement span opened for traffic five days later. The original eastern section was dismantled between January 2014 and November 2017.


====2013 public &quot;light sculpture&quot; installation ====
On March 5, 2013, a public art installation called &quot;The Bay Lights&quot; was activated on the western span&#x27;s vertical cables. The installation was designed by artist Leo Villareal and consists of 25,000 LED lights originally scheduled to be on nightly display until March 2015. However, on December 17, 2014, the non-profit Illuminate The Arts announced that it had raised the $4 million needed to make the lights permanent; the display was temporarily turned off starting in March 2015 in order to perform maintenance and install sturdier bulbs and then re-lit on January 30, 2016.

In order to reduce driver distractions, the privately funded display is not visible to users of the bridge, only to distant observers. This lighting effort is intended to form part of a larger project to &quot;light the bay&quot;. Villareal used various algorithms to generate patterns such as rainfall, reflections on water, bird flight, expanding rings, and others. Villareal&#x27;s patterns and transitions will be sequenced and their duration determined by computerized random number generator to make each viewing experience unique. Owing to the efficiency of the LED system employed, the estimated operating cost is only US$15.00 per night.

The lights were switched off permanently at 8 pm on March 5, 2023 – the 10th anniversary of the artwork. This was done due to their poor condition and increasing costs to maintain properly. There is a plan to raise additional funds and install a new set of lights later in the year.

==== Alexander Zuckermann Bike Path ====
The pedestrian and bicycle route on the eastern section opened on September 3, 2013, and is named after Alexander Zuckermann, founding chair of the East Bay Bicycle Coalition. This forms a transbay route for the San Francisco Bay Trail. Until October 2016, the path did not connect to Yerba Buena and Treasure Island sidewalks, due to the need to demolish more of the old eastern section before final construction. On May 2, 2017, public access was extended to seven days a week, 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., with occasional closure days for continued demolition of the old bridge foundations. This work was completed on November 11, 2017.

==== Yerba Buena Tunnel closure and repair ====
On January 30, 2016, a chunk of concrete the size of an automobile tire fell from the tunnel wall into the slow lane of eastbound traffic on the lower deck of the Yerba Buena Tunnel, causing a minor accident. The concrete fell from where the upper deck is connected to the tunnel wall. Based on an examination of photographs, a professor from Georgia Tech postulated that water infiltration into the concrete wall had caused the reinforcing steel to corrode and expand, forcing a chunk of the tunnel wall out. A subsequent California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) investigation identified 12 spots on both sides of the tunnel wall in the lower deck space showed signs of corrosion-induced damage, but no immediate risk of further spalling. The apparent cause was rainwater leaking from upper deck drains. Caltrans engineers speculated the Masonite pads had swelled due to rainwater infiltration, cracking the tunnel walls and allowing moisture in to the reinforcing steel. Repairs to the degraded concrete started in February 2017. Drains and catch basins were replaced to reduce the likelihood of clogging, and fiberglass-reinforced mortar was used to patch removed concrete. The repairs, which required some daytime lane closures, were expected to last until June 2017.

==== 2020 bus lane proposal ====
In January 2020, the AC Transit and BART boards of directors supported the establishment of dedicated bus lanes on the bridge. In February 2020, Rob Bonta introduced state legislation to begin planning bus lanes on the bridge.

==== Opening of the Judge John Shutter Regional Shoreline ====
On October 21, 2020, the Judge John Sutter Regional Shoreline park opened to the public. Located at the foot of the bridge, the opening of the park has led to easier access to the bike and pedestrian path due to improved parking and pedestrian access.

==== 2016-2023 exit reconstructions ====
In the 1960s directional reconfiguration, there were three off-ramps added to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island: a single left-hand side exit in the western direction at the east end of the tunnel, a left-hand side exit in the eastern direction at the west end of the tunnel (originally signed as just &quot;Treasure Island&quot;), and a right-hand side exit in eastern direction at the east end of the tunnel (originally signed as just &quot;Yerba Buena Island&quot;). The eastbound left exit in particular presented an unusual hazard – drivers had to slow within the normal traffic flow and move into a very short off-ramp that ended in a short radius turn left turn; accordingly, a 15 MPH advisory was posted there. The turn had been further narrowed from its original design by the installation of crash pads on the island side. The eastbound and westbound on-ramps were then on the usual right-hand side, but they did not have dedicated merge lanes, forcing drivers to await gaps in traffic and then accelerate from a stop sign to traffic speeds in a short distance. In 2016, a new on-ramp and off-ramp at the east end of the tunnel were opened in the western direction on the right-hand side of the roadway, replacing the left-hand side off-ramp in that direction. Meanwhile, the eastbound right-hand side off-ramp and on-ramp at the east end of the tunnel was demolished during the reconstruction of the eastern span of the bridge. A new on-ramp on this side was built with a dedicated merge lane, but the off-ramp&#x27;s replacement was not completed until early-May 2023, well after the bridge&#x27;s bike path from the Oakland side to the island was fully completed. The eastbound left-hand side off-ramp and westbound on-ramp at the west end of the tunnel are then scheduled then close as early as late-May 2023 while the western span undergoes a seismic retrofit.

==Financing and tolls==
===Current toll rates===

Tolls are only collected from westbound traffic at the toll plaza on the Oakland side of the bridge. Those just traveling between Yerba Buena Island and the main part of San Francisco are not tolled. All-electronic tolling has been in effect since 2020, and drivers may either pay using the FasTrak electronic toll collection device or using the license plate tolling program. It remains not truly an open road tolling system until the remaining unused toll booths are removed, forcing drivers to slow substantially from freeway speeds while passing through. Effective , the toll rate for passenger cars is $8. During peak traffic hours on weekdays between 5:00 am and 10:00 am, and between 3:00 pm and 7:00 pm, carpool vehicles carrying three or more people, clean air vehicles, or motorcycles may pay a discounted toll of $4 if they have FasTrak and use the designated carpool lane. Drivers without Fastrak or a license plate account must open and pay via a &quot;short term&quot; account within 48 hours after crossing the bridge or they will be sent an invoice of the unpaid toll. No additional toll violation penalty will be assessed if the invoice is paid within 21 days.

===Historical toll rates===
When the Bay Bridge opened in 1936, the toll was 65 cents (), collected in each direction by men in booths fronting each lane of traffic. Within months, the toll was lowered to 50 cents in order to compete with the ferry system, and finally to 25 cents since this was shown sufficient to pay off the original revenue bonds on schedule (equivalent to $ and $ in respectively). In 1951 there were eighty collectors working various shifts.

On Monday, September 1, 1969, (Labor Day) a change of policy resulted in the toll being collected thereafter only from westbound traffic, at twice the previous rate; eastbound vehicles were toll-exempt.

Tolls were subsequently raised to finance improvements to the bridge approaches, required to connect with new freeways, and to subsidize public transit in order to reduce the traffic over the bridge. The toll was increased by a quarter dollar to 75 cents in 1978 (), where it remained for a decade.

Caltrans, the state highway transportation agency, maintains seven of the eight San Francisco Bay Area bridges. (The Golden Gate Bridge is owned and maintained by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District.)

The basic toll (for automobiles) on the seven state-owned bridges, including the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, was standardized to $1 by Regional Measure 1, approved by Bay Area voters in 1988 (). A $1 seismic retrofit surcharge was added in 1998 by the state legislature, increasing the toll to $2 (), originally for eight years, but since then extended to December 2037 (AB1171, October 2001). On March 2, 2004, voters approved Regional Measure 2 to fund various transportation improvement projects, raising the toll by another dollar to $3 (). An additional dollar was added to the toll starting January 1, 2007, to cover cost overruns on the eastern span replacement of the Bay Bridge, increasing the toll to $4 ().

The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, a regional transportation agency, in its capacity as the Bay Area Toll Authority, administers RM1 and RM2 funds, a significant portion of which are allocated to public transit capital improvements and operating subsidies in the transportation corridors served by the bridges. Caltrans administers the &quot;second dollar&quot; seismic surcharge, and receives some of the MTC-administered funds to perform other maintenance work on the bridges. The Bay Area Toll Authority is made up of appointed officials put in place by various city and county governments, and is not subject to direct voter oversight.

Due to further funding shortages for seismic retrofit projects, the Bay Area Toll Authority again raised tolls on all seven of the state-owned bridges (this excludes the Golden Gate Bridge) in July 2010. The toll rate for autos on other Bay Area bridges was increased to $5 (), but in the Bay Bridge a congestion pricing tolling scheme was implemented. This variable pricing system was not truly congestion priced because toll rates came from a preset schedule and are not based on actual congestion. A $6 toll () was charged from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. During weekends cars paid the standard $5 toll like the other bridges. Carpools before the implementation were exempted but began to pay $2.50 (), and the carpool toll discount became available only to drivers with FasTrak electronic toll devices. The toll remained at the previous toll of $4 at all other times on weekdays (now ). The Bay Area Toll Authority reported that by October 2010 fewer users are driving during the peak hours and more vehicles are crossing the Bay Bridge before and after the 5–10 a.m. period in which the congestion toll goes into effect. Commute delays in the first six months dropped by an average of 15% compared with 2009. For vehicles with at least 3 axles, the toll rate was $5 per axle.

In June 2018, Bay Area voters approved Regional Measure 3 to further raise the tolls on all seven of the state-owned bridges to fund $4.5 billion worth of transportation improvements in the area. Under the passed measure, the tolls on the Bay Bridge were raised by $1 on January 1, 2019, then again on January 1, 2022, and again on January 1, 2025. Thus under the congestion pricing scheme, the tolls for autos during the peak weekday rush hours were set to $7 in 2019, $8 in 2022, and $9 in 2025; for the non-rush periods, $5 in 2019, $6 in 2022, and $7 in 2025; and on weekends, $6 in 2019, $7 in 2022, and $8 in 2025. Congestion pricing was then suspended indefinitely in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving the weekend toll rates in effect for all days and times.

In September 2019, the MTC approved a $4 million plan to eliminate toll takers and convert all seven of the state-owned bridges to all-electronic tolling, citing that 80 percent of drivers are now using Fastrak and the change would improve traffic flow. On March 20, 2020, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, all-electronic tolling was placed in effect for all seven state-owned toll bridges. The MTC then installed new systems at all seven bridges to make them permanently cashless by the start of 2021. In April 2022, the Bay Area Toll Authority announced plans to remove all remaining unused toll booths and create an open-road tolling system which functions at highway speeds; until then, drivers must still slow substantially while passing through the toll plaza.

The Bay Area Toll Authority then approved a plan in December 2024 to implement 50-cent annual toll increases on all seven state-owned bridges between 2026 and 2030 to help pay for bridge maintenance. The standard toll rate for autos will thus rise to $8.50 on January 1, 2026; $9 in 2027; $9.50 in 2028; $10 in 2029; and then to $10.50 in 2030. And becoming effective in 2027, a 25-cent surcharge will be added to any toll charged to a license plate account, and a 50-cent surcharge added to a toll violation invoice, due to the added cost of processing these payment methods.

<text>Flamingos or flamingoes () are a type of wading bird in the family Phoenicopteridae, which is the only extant family in the order Phoenicopteriformes. There are four flamingo species distributed throughout the Americas (including the Caribbean), and two species native to Afro-Eurasia.

A group of flamingoes is called a &quot;flamboyance&quot;, or a &quot;stand&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;flamingo&quot; comes from Portuguese or Spanish ; in turn, the word comes from Provençal – a combination of and a Germanic-like suffix &quot;&quot;. The word may also have been influenced by the Spanish ethnonym or .
The name of the genus, &quot;Phoenicopterus&quot;, is ; other genera names include &quot;Phoeniconaias,&quot; which means , and &quot;Phoenicoparrus,&quot; which means .

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The family Phoenicopteridae was introduced by the French zoologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1831, with &quot;Phoenicopterus&quot; as the type genus.

Traditionally, the long-legged Ciconiiformes, probably a paraphyletic assemblage, have been considered the flamingos&#x27; closest relatives and the family was included in the order. Usually, the ibises and spoonbills of the Threskiornithidae were considered their closest relatives within this order. Earlier genetic studies, such as those of Charles Sibley and colleagues, also supported this relationship. Relationships to the waterfowl were considered as well, especially as flamingos are parasitized by feather lice of the genus &quot;Anaticola&quot;, which are otherwise exclusively found on ducks and geese. The peculiar presbyornithids were used to argue for a close relationship between flamingos, waterfowl, and waders. A 2002 paper concluded they are waterfowl, but a 2014 comprehensive study of bird orders found that flamingos and grebes are not waterfowl, but rather are part of Columbea, along with doves, sandgrouse, and mesites.

===Relationship with grebes===
Recent molecular studies have suggested a relation with grebes, while morphological evidence also strongly supports a relationship between flamingos and grebes. They hold at least 11 morphological traits in common, which are not found in other birds. Many of these characteristics have been previously identified on flamingos, but not on grebes. The fossil palaelodids can be considered evolutionarily, and ecologically, intermediate between flamingos and grebes.

For the grebe-flamingo clade, the taxon Mirandornithes (&quot;miraculous birds&quot; due to their extreme divergence and apomorphies) has been proposed. Alternatively, they could be placed in one order, with Phoenocopteriformes taking priority.

===Phylogeny===
The cladogram below showing the phylogenetic relationships between the six extant flamingo species is based on a study by Roberto Frias-Soler and collaborators that was published in 2022.
===Species===
Six extant flamingo species are recognized by most sources, and were formerly placed in one genus (have common characteristics) – &quot;Phoenicopterus&quot;. As a result of a 2014 publication, the family was reclassified into two genera. In 2020, the family had three recognized genera, according to HBW.

Prehistoric species of flamingo:
* &quot;Elornis&quot;? (Late Oligocene of France, Europe)
* &quot;Harrisonavis&quot; (Middle Oligocene–Middle Miocene of C. Europe)
* &quot;Leakeyornis&quot; (Early to Middle Miocene of Lake Victoria, Kenya)
* &quot;Phoeniconaias proeses&quot; (Pliocene of Lake Kanunka, Australia)
* &quot;Phoeniconaias siamensis&quot; (Early Miocene of Mae Long Reservoir, Thailand)
* &quot;Phoeniconotius&quot; (Late Oligocene of South Australia)
* &quot;Phoenicopterus copei&quot; (Late Pleistocene of North America and Mexico)
* &quot;Phoenicopterus floridanus&quot; (Early Pliocene of Florida)
* &quot;Phoenicopterus minutus&quot; (Late Pleistocene of California, US)
* &quot;Phoenicopterus novaehollandiae&quot; (Late Oligocene of South Australia)
* &quot;Phoenicopterus stocki&quot; (Middle Pliocene of Rincón, Mexico)
* &quot;Xenorhynchopsis&quot; (Pliocene to Pleistocene of Australia)

==Description==


Flamingos usually stand on one leg with the other tucked beneath the body. The reason for this behaviour is not fully understood. One theory is that standing on one leg allows the birds to conserve more body heat, given that they spend a significant amount of time wading in cold water. However, the behaviour also takes place in warm water and is also observed in birds that do not typically stand in water. An alternative theory is that standing on one leg reduces the energy expenditure for producing muscular effort to stand and balance on one leg. A study on cadavers showed that the one-legged pose could be held without any muscle activity, while living flamingos demonstrate substantially less body sway in a one-legged posture.

While walking, a flamingo&#x27;s legs may appear to bend backwards. This appearance is due to the middle joint on their legs being their ankle, not their knee. Flamingos also have webbed feet that aid with swimming and they may stamp their feet in the mud to stir up food from the bottom.

Flamingos are capable flyers, and flamingos in captivity often require wing clipping to prevent escape. A pair of African flamingos which had not yet had their wings clipped escaped from the Wichita, Kansas, zoo in 2005. One was spotted in Texas 14 years later. It had been seen previously by birders in Texas, Wisconsin and Louisiana.

Young flamingos hatch with grayish-red plumage, but adults range from light pink to bright red due to aqueous bacteria and beta-carotene obtained from their food supply. A well-fed, healthy flamingo is more vibrantly colored, thus a more desirable mate; a white or pale flamingo, however, is usually unhealthy or malnourished. Captive flamingos are a notable exception; even if adequately nourished, they may turn a pale pink if they are not fed carotene at levels comparable to the wild.

The greater flamingo is the tallest of the six different species of flamingos, standing at with a weight up to , and the shortest flamingo species (the lesser) has a height of and weighs . Flamingos can have a wingspan as small as to as big as .

Flamingos can open their bills by raising the upper jaw as well as by dropping the lower.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Feeding===
Flamingos are omnivores who filter-feed on brine shrimp and blue-green algae as well as insect larvae, small insects, mollusks and crustaceans. Their bills are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they eat, and are uniquely used upside-down. The filtering of food items is assisted by hairy structures called lamellae, which line the mandibles, and the large, rough-surfaced tongue. The pink or reddish color of flamingos comes from carotenoids in their diet of animal and plant plankton. American flamingos are a brighter red color because of the beta carotene availability in their food while the lesser flamingos are a paler pink due to ingesting a smaller amount of this pigment. These carotenoids are broken down into pigments by liver enzymes. The source of this varies by species, and affects the color saturation. Flamingos whose sole diet is blue-green algae are darker than those that get it second-hand by eating animals that have digested blue-green algae.

Though flamingos prefer to drink freshwater, they are equipped with glands under their eyes that remove extra salt from their bodies. This organ allows them to drink saltwater as well.

===Vocalization sounds===
Flamingos are considered very noisy birds with their noises and vocalizations ranging from grunting or growling to nasal honking. Vocalizations play an important role in parent-chick recognition, ritualized displays, and keeping large flocks together. Variations in vocalizations exist in the voices of different species of flamingos.

===Life cycle===
Flamingos are very social birds; they live in colonies whose population can number in the thousands. These large colonies are believed to serve three purposes for the flamingos: avoiding predators, maximizing food intake, and using scarce suitable nesting sites more efficiently. Before breeding, flamingo colonies split into breeding groups of about 15 to 50 birds. Both males and females in these groups perform synchronized ritual displays. The members of a group stand together and display to each other by stretching their necks upwards, then uttering calls while head-flagging, and then flapping their wings. The displays do not seem directed towards an individual, but occur randomly. These displays stimulate &quot;synchronous nesting&quot; (see below) and help pair up those birds that do not already have mates.

Flamingos form strong pair bonds, although in larger colonies, flamingos sometimes change mates, presumably because more mates are available to choose. Flamingo pairs establish and defend nesting territories. They locate a suitable spot on the mudflat to build a nest (the female usually selects the place). Copulation usually occurs during nest building, which is sometimes interrupted by another flamingo pair trying to commandeer the nesting site for their use. Flamingos aggressively defend their nesting sites. Both the male and the female contribute to building the nest, and to protecting the nest and egg. Same-sex pairs have been reported.

After the chicks hatch, the only parental expense is feeding. Both the male and the female feed their chicks with a kind of crop milk, produced in glands lining the whole of the upper digestive tract (not just the crop). The hormone prolactin stimulates production. Crop milk contains both fat and protein, as with mammalian milk, but unlike mammalian milk, it contains no carbohydrates. (Pigeons and doves also produce crop milk, though just in the glands lining the crop, which contains less fat and more protein than flamingo crop milk.)

For the first six days after the chicks hatch, the adults and chicks stay in the nesting sites. At around 7–12 days old, the chicks begin to move out of their nests and explore their surroundings. When they are two weeks old, the chicks congregate in groups, called &quot;microcrèches&quot;, and their parents leave them alone. After a while, the microcrèches merge into &quot;crèches&quot; containing thousands of chicks. Chicks that do not stay in their crèches are vulnerable to predators. When young flamingos are around three to three and a half months old, their flight feathers will finish growing in, allowing them to fly.

==Status and conservation==
===In captivity===
The first flamingo hatched in a European zoo was a Chilean flamingo at Zoo Basel in Switzerland in 1958. Since then, over 389 flamingos have grown up in Basel and been distributed to other zoos around the globe.

Greater, a greater flamingo who was at least 83 years old and believed to be the oldest in the world, died at the Adelaide Zoo in Australia in January 2014.

Zoos have used mirrors to improve flamingo breeding behaviour. The mirrors are thought to give the flamingos the impression that they are in a larger flock than they actually are.

==Relationship with humans==

===Ancient Roman cuisine===

While many different kinds of birds were valued items in Roman food, flamingos were among the most prized in Ancient Roman cuisine. An early reference to their consumption, and especially of their tongues, is found in Pliny the Elder, who states in the &quot;Natural History&quot;:

Although a few recipes for flamingos are found in Apicius&#x27; extant works, none refer specifically to flamingo tongues. The three flamingo recipes in the (&quot;On the Subject of Cooking&quot;) involve the whole creature:
* 220: roasted with an egg sauce, a recipe for wood pigeons, squabs, fattened fowl; flamingo is an afterthought.
* 230: boiled; parrot may be substituted.
* 231: roasted with a must sauce.

Suetonius mentions flamingo tongues in his &quot;Life of Vitellius&quot;:

Martial, the poet, devoted an ironic epigram, alluding to flamingo tongues:

There is also a mention of flamingo brains in a later, highly contentious source, detailing, in the life of Elagabalus, a food item not apparently to his liking as much as camels&#x27; heels and parrot tongues, in the belief that the latter was a prophylactic:

===Other===

* In the Americas, the Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals, and often depicted flamingos in their art.
* The Ancient Egyptian god Set is depicted with a flamingo head in the &quot;Book of the Faiyum.&quot;
* Flamingos are the national bird of the Bahamas.
* Andean miners have killed flamingos for their fat, believing that it would cure tuberculosis.
* In the United States, pink plastic flamingos are sometimes used as lawn ornaments. They were first designed by Don Featherstone in 1957. Their popularity was influenced in part by the prevalence of flamingo souvenirs in Florida along with the Flamingo grand hotel in Miami Beach, prompting the correlation of flamingos with style and wealth.

<text>The Flamingos are an American doo-wop group formed in Chicago in 1953. The band became popular in mid-to-late 1950s and are best known for their 1959 cover version of &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot;. They have since been hailed as being one of the finest and most influential vocal groups in pop and doo wop music history. In 2001, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The band&#x27;s cover version of &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; was ranked number 158 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

==History==
===Early quintet===
Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Carey (bass) and Ezekiel &quot;Zeke&quot; Carey (second tenor) formed the group in Chicago after meeting cousins baritone Paul Wilson and first tenor Johnny Carter at a Hebrew Israelite congregation. Earl Lewis (not the Channels lead) soon joined, and after a series of name changes (&quot;The Swallows&quot;, &quot;El Flamingos&quot;, &quot;The Five Flamingos&quot;), wound up being known as the Flamingos. Sollie McElroy soon replaced Lewis (who joined the Five Echoes). The Flamingos&#x27; first single (for Chance Records), &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot;, was a moderate local success, as was the follow-up &quot;That&#x27;s My Desire&quot;, but it was Johnny Carter&#x27;s composition of &quot;Golden Teardrops&quot;, with its complex vocal harmonies and Carter&#x27;s soaring falsetto, that cemented their reputation as a top regional act of the day.

The Flamingos left Chance Records sometime after their December 1953 session, and signed with DJ Al Benson&#x27;s Parrot Records. Sollie McElroy was on their first Parrot session, but left the group in December 1954, to be replaced by tenor Nate Nelson (who was on their second Parrot session; he&#x27;s lead on &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, released in January 1955). In early 1955, the Flamingos signed with Chess Records, to record for their Checker Records subsidiary. At Chess/Checker, the Flamingos achieved their first national chart hit with &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home&quot;, which went to number 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B chart. Pat Boone&#x27;s cover version of the song, complete with revised lyrics (&quot;My mind&#x27;s made up&quot; replacing &quot;My time&#x27;s about up&quot;), was a hit on the pop charts. The group also had moderate success for the label with other chestnuts like &quot;A Kiss from Your Lips&quot;, &quot;The Vow&quot; and &quot;Would I Be Crying&quot;. The Flamingos also appeared in the 1956 Alan Freed movie &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot;. Both Zeke Carey and Carter were drafted that year (Carter was drafted in September).

Nate Nelson, Jake Carey and Paul Wilson continued the group with new member Tommy Hunt (added in October 1956). Another new member, tenor/lead, guitarist and arranger, Terry &quot;Buzzy&quot; Johnson, joined in late December 1958. The group (Nate Nelson, Tommy Hunt, Paul Wilson, and Jake Carey) began recording for Decca Records in April 1957. Their most notable single was Johnson&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;The Ladder of Love&quot;, but legal entanglements between Checker and Nate Nelson ruined any chance of commercial success. Zeke Carey returned to the Flamingos in 1958, making the group a sextet. (When Johnny Carter was discharged from the service, he joined the Dells, performing with them for almost 50 years until his death in 2009.)

Zeke and Jake Carey were not blood-related, but were considered cousins, because Zeke was adopted by Jake&#x27;s aunt and uncle.

===End Records===
In 1958 the Flamingos began recording for George Goldner&#x27;s End Records in New York City, where they had several national hits. Almost immediately, the group had their first pop chart hit with &quot;Lovers Never Say Goodbye&quot;, written by Terry Johnson, who shared lead chores on the song with Paul Wilson. The formula was a winner as Johnson and Wilson also led three of the 12 songs selected for their first album &quot;Flamingo Serenade&quot;George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Love Walked In&quot;, &quot;But Not for Me&quot; and &quot;Time Was&quot;. The Flamingos had their biggest seller in 1959 with another old standard from that LP, on which Nate Nelson handled lead vocals. &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; (written in 1934 by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin for the film Dames) became their biggest seller, and has been featured in dozens of movies and TV shows. A long series of hits followed, including the Johnson-penned &quot;Mio Amore&quot;, Doc Pomus&#x27; composition &quot;Your Other Love&quot;, &quot;Nobody Loves Me Like You&quot; (written for the group by Sam Cooke), and &quot;I Was Such a Fool (To Fall in Love with You)&quot;. LP cuts &quot;Love Walked In&quot; and &quot;Time Was&quot; were also issued as singles. In the same year, they appeared in the Alan Freed movie, &quot;Go, Johnny, Go&quot;, singing a frenetic version of &quot;Jump Children&quot; (originally recorded for Chance Records in the early days). The group became known almost as much for their stage show and choreography as for their harmonies. Groups including the Temptations and the Tavares later credited the group as major influences.

===Splintering of the group===
The group began to come apart at the turn of the decade. Tommy Hunt left for a solo career in 1960. Nate Nelson and Terry Johnson split to form the &quot;Modern Flamingos&quot; in 1961, and went on to record as the Starglows on Atco Records in 1963. (The Modern Flamingos name was used later; the group would include members of the defunct Del-Knights in the late 1960s). New members were brought in, making the group Zeke Carey (tenor), Jake Carey (bass), Paul Wilson (baritone), Billy Clarke (tenor), Eddie Williams (tenor), Alan Fontaine (guitar), and Julien Vaught (saxophone). Also Johnny Carter left in 1960 to join the Dells. Clarke and Williams took duties performing on most new lead vocals.

A sixth vocalist, Doug McClure, was added in 1962. Shortly afterwards, Clarke and Williams left the group. Founding member Paul Wilson left in 1964, new member Sidney Hall joined in 1966, and Jacob Carey&#x27;s son J.C. Carey joined in 1969. They recorded several uptempo songs through the 1960s, peaking at number 26 in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;The Boogaloo Party&quot;. Around that time, the Flamingos formed their own label, Ronze, and produced many of their own recordings.

The group continued recording into the 1970s. A new album was released in 1972 on Ronze, entitled &quot;The Flamingos Today&quot;. By this time, the group was the Careys, McClure, Fontaine, the returning Billy Clarke, and former Limelite Clarence Bassett, Jr. New member Frank &quot;Mingo&quot; Ayers joined soon after. More mildly successful recordings came in this decade, including the uptempo &quot;Heavy Hips&quot;, and &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;.

By 1980, the group was Jake Carey, Zeke Carey, Frank Ayers and Jerome Wilson. Ayers left around this time, joining the Del Vikings. In 1984, two new members joined: Bennie Cherry and Archie Satterfield. In 1988, the group was featured at the 1988 Grammy Awards. Paul Wilson died on May 6, 1988. By the early 1990s, the group was the Careys, Satterfield, Ron Reace and Kenny Davis. Later, it was the Careys, Reace, and King Raymond Green. Jake Carey died in 1997. The group recorded a new album, &quot;Unspoken Emotions&quot;, under the Ronze label in 1999. It featuring re-recordings of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing But A Party&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home&quot;, led by Zeke Carey. The group appeared on the PBS television special &quot;Doo Wop 50&quot; that same year. The lineup was Zeke Carey, J.C. Carey, Ron Reace, King Raymond Green, and Larry Jordan. Zeke Carey died on December 24, 1999. King Raymond Green and Ron Reace left around that time and were replaced by Earnest &quot;Just Mike&quot; Gilbert and former Dynamic Superior George Spann. James Faison entered shortly thereafter. Tommy Hunt has flown in from England (where he has lived since 1970) to perform with this group twice since 2001.

The group split up in late 2005 due to money disputes. Spann, Jordan, Gilbert, and Faison grouped together to reform Spann&#x27;s old group, The Dynamic Superiors. J.C. Carey brought in new members, and toured with Tommy Hunt starting in April 2007.

Terry Johnson is the owner of the &quot;Flamingos&quot; federal trademark and leads the current incarnation of the group. The current lineup is Johnson, Starling Newsome, Stan Prinston and musical director Theresa Trigg. The Flamingos featuring Terry Johnson appeared on two PBS specials: &quot;Rock and Roll at Fifty&quot; (in which they were the only group to have more than two songs featured) and &quot;Doo Wop Cavalcade: The Definitive Anthology&quot;. In 2013, the Flamingos released the Diamond Anniversary Tour CD. They continue to perform in concerts across the country.

Doug McClure died on July 6, 2018.

===Pepsi lawsuit===
J. C. Carey, Jr., Terry Johnson, Tommy Hunt and descendants of Nate Nelson and Paul Wilson sued PepsiCo for having used &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; in a 1998 television commercial, allegedly without having consulted the group. The group was awarded $250,000.

==Awards==
The Flamingos received the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation Pioneer Award in 1996 (where Terry Johnson, Jake Carey, Zeke Carey, Tommy Hunt, and Johnny Carter performed) and were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Doo-Wop Hall of Fame in 2004. The group which performed at the Rock Hall ceremony included Terry Johnson on lead, Hunt, and Carter. In 2003, the Flamingos&#x27; recording of &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Award Hall of Fame.

<doc id="165932" wikidata="Q206439" url="?curid=165932" title="Isaac Hayes">
<text>Isaac Lee Hayes Jr. (August 20, 1942 – August 10, 2008) was an American singer, songwriter, composer, and actor. He was one of the creative forces behind the Southern soul music label Stax Records in the 1960s, serving as an in-house songwriter with his partner David Porter, 
as well as a session musician and record producer. Hayes and Porter were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of writing scores of songs for themselves, the duo Sam &amp; Dave, Carla Thomas, and others. In 2002, Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

&quot;Soul Man,&quot; written by Hayes and Porter and first performed by Sam &amp; Dave, was recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame. It was also honored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as one of the Songs of the Century. During the late 1960s, Hayes also began a career as a recording artist. He released several successful soul albums such as &quot;Hot Buttered Soul&quot; (1969) and &quot;Black Moses&quot; (1971). In addition to his work in popular music, Hayes worked as a film composer.

Hayes was known for his musical score for the film &quot;Shaft&quot; (1971). For the &quot;Theme from &quot;Shaft&quot;,&quot; he was awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972, making him the third black person, after Hattie McDaniel and Sidney Poitier, to win an Academy Award in any competitive field covered by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Hayes also won two Grammy Awards that same year. Later, he won his third Grammy for his album &quot;Black Moses&quot;.

In 1992, Hayes was crowned honorary king of the Ada region of Ghana in recognition of his humanitarian work there. He acted in films and television, such as in the movies &quot;Truck Turner&quot; (1974), &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981) and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot; (1988), and as Gandolf &quot;Gandy&quot; Fitch in the TV series &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (1974–1980). Hayes also voiced the character Chef in the Comedy Central animated series &quot;South Park&quot; from its debut in 1997 until his controversial departure in 2006.

On August 5, 2003, Hayes was honored as a BMI Icon at the 2003 BMI Urban Awards for his enduring influence on generations of musicians. Throughout his songwriting career, Hayes received five BMI R&amp;B Awards, two BMI Pop Awards, two BMI Urban Awards and six Million-Air citations. As of 2008, his songs had generated more than 12 million performances.

==Early life==
Isaac Lee Hayes Jr. was born in Covington, Tennessee, the second child of Eula (&quot;née&quot; Wade) and Isaac Hayes Sr. After his mother died young and his father abandoned his family, Hayes was raised by his maternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Willie Wade Sr. The child of a sharecropper family, Hayes grew up working on farms in the Tennessee counties of Shelby and Tipton. At age five, Hayes began singing at his local church and he taught himself to play the piano, Hammond organ, flute, and saxophone.

Hayes dropped out of high school, but his former teachers at Manassas High School in Memphis encouraged him to complete his diploma, which he did at the age of 21. After graduating from high school, Hayes was offered several music scholarships from colleges and universities. He turned down all of them to provide for his immediate family, working at a meat-packing plant in Memphis by day and playing nightclubs and juke joints several evenings a week in Memphis and nearby northern Mississippi. Hayes&#x27;s first professional gigs, in the late 1950s, were as a singer at Curry&#x27;s Club in North Memphis, backed by Ben Branch&#x27;s houseband.

==Career==
===1963–1974: Stax Records and &quot;Shaft&quot;===
Hayes began his recording career in the early 1960s, as a session musician for acts recorded by the Memphis-based Stax Records. He later wrote a string of hit songs with songwriting partner David Porter, including &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Like I Know,&quot; &quot;Soul Man,&quot; &quot;When Something Is Wrong with My Baby&quot; and &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot; for Sam &amp; Dave. Hayes, Porter and Stax studio band Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s were also the producers for Sam &amp; Dave, Carla Thomas and other Stax artists during the mid-1960s. One of the first Stax records Hayes played on was &quot;Winter Snow&quot; by Booker T. and The M.G.s (Stax 45–236), which indicates &quot;Introducing Isaac Hayes on piano&quot; on the label.

Hayes-Porter contributed to the Stax sound of this period, and Sam &amp; Dave credited Hayes for helping develop both their sound and style. In 1968, Hayes released his debut album, &quot;Presenting Isaac Hayes&quot;, a jazzy, largely improvised effort that was commercially unsuccessful.

Stax then went through a major upheaval, losing its biggest star when Otis Redding died in a plane crash in December 1967, and then losing its back catalog to Atlantic Records in May 1968. As a result, Stax executive vice president Al Bell called for 27 new albums to be completed in mid-1969; Hayes&#x27;s second album, &quot;Hot Buttered Soul&quot; was the most successful of these releases.

On &quot;Hot Buttered Soul&quot;, Hayes reinterpreted &quot;Walk On By&quot; (previously recorded by Dionne Warwick) into a 12-minute exploration. &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; starts with an eight-minute-long monologue before breaking into song, and the lone original number, the funky &quot;Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic&quot; runs nearly ten minutes, a significant break from the standard three-minute soul/pop songs. &quot;Walk On By&quot; would be the first of many times Hayes would take a Burt Bacharach standard, generally known as three-minute pop songs by Dionne Warwick or Dusty Springfield, and transform it into a soulful, lengthy and almost gospel number.

In 1970, Hayes released two albums, &quot;The Isaac Hayes Movement&quot; and &quot;...To Be Continued&quot;. The former stuck to the four-song template of his previous album. Jerry Butler&#x27;s &quot;I Stand Accused&quot; begins with a trademark spoken word monologue, and Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot; is re-worked. The latter album included &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; another Bacharach song transformed into an 11-minute epic of lush orchestral rhythm (mid-way it breaks into a rhythm guitar jam for a couple of minutes before suddenly resuming the slow love song). An edited three-minute version was issued as a single. The album featured the instrumental &quot;Ike&#x27;s Mood,&quot; which segues into a version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Loving Feeling.&quot; Hayes released a Christmas single, &quot;The Mistletoe and Me&quot; (with &quot;Winter Snow&quot; as a B-side).

In early 1971, Hayes composed music for the soundtrack of the blaxploitation film &quot;Shaft&quot; (he appeared in a cameo role as a bartender). The title theme, with its wah-wah guitar and multi-layered symphonic arrangement, would become a worldwide hit single, and spent two weeks at number one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in November. The remainder of the album was mostly instrumentals covering big beat jazz, bluesy funk, and hard Stax-styled soul. The other two vocal songs, the social commentary &quot;Soulsville&quot; and the 19-minute jam &quot;Do Your Thing,&quot; would be edited down to hit singles. He won an &quot;Academy Award for Best Original Song&quot; for the &quot;Theme from &quot;Shaft&quot;,&quot; and in addition was nominated for Best Original Dramatic Score. Later in the year, Hayes released a double album, &quot;Black Moses&quot;, that expanded on his earlier sounds and featured The Jackson 5&#x27;s song &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye.&quot; Another single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It,&quot; was not featured on the album.

In 1972, Hayes would record the theme tune for the television series &quot;The Men&quot; and release a hit single (with &quot;Type Thang&quot; as a B-side). He released a couple of other non-album singles during the year, such as &quot;If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Right)&quot; and &quot;Rolling Down a Mountainside.&quot; Atlantic would re-release Hayes&#x27;s debut album this year with the new title &quot;In The Beginning&quot;.

Hayes was back in 1973 with an acclaimed live double album, &quot;Live at the Sahara Tahoe&quot;, and followed it up with the album &quot;Joy&quot;. He moved away from cover songs with this album. An edited version of the title track would be a hit single.

In 1974, Hayes was featured in the blaxploitation films &quot;Three Tough Guys&quot; and &quot;Truck Turner&quot;, and he recorded soundtracks for both. &quot;Tough Guys&quot; was almost devoid of vocals and &quot;Truck Turner&quot; yielded a single with the title theme. The soundtrack score of &quot;Truck Turner&quot; was eventually used by filmmaker Quentin Tarantino in the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; film series, and has been used for over 30 years as the opening score of Brazilian radio show &quot;Jornal de Esportes&quot; on the Jovem Pan station.

Unlike most African American musicians of the period, Hayes did not sport an Afro haircut; his bald head became one of his defining characteristics.

===1974–1977: HBS, basketball team ownership, and bankruptcy===
By 1974, Stax Records was having serious financial problems, stemming from problems with overextension and limited record sales and distribution. Hayes himself was deep in debt to Union Planters Bank, which administered loans for the Stax label and many of its other key employees. In September of that year, Hayes sued Stax for $5.3 million. As Stax was in deep debt and could not pay, the label made an arrangement with Hayes and Union Planters: Stax released Hayes from his recording and production contracts, and Union Planters would collect all of Hayes&#x27;s income and apply it towards his debts.

Hayes formed his own label, Hot Buttered Soul, which released its product through ABC Records. His new album, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Chocolate Chip&quot;, saw Hayes embrace the disco sound with the title track and lead single. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Turn Around&quot; would prove a popular song as time went on. This would be Hayes&#x27;s last album to chart in the top 40 for many years. Later in the year, the all-instrumental &quot;Disco Connection&quot; album fully embraced disco.

On July 17, 1974, Hayes, along with Mike Storen, Avron Fogelman, and Kemmons Wilson, took over ownership of the American Basketball Association team the Memphis Tams. The prior owner was Charles O. Finley, the owner of the Oakland A&#x27;s baseball team. Hayes&#x27;s group renamed the team the Memphis Sounds. Despite a 66% increase in home attendance, hiring well regarded coach Joe Mullaney and, unlike in the prior three seasons, making the 1975 ABA Playoffs (losing to the eventual champion Kentucky Colonels in the Eastern Division semi-finals), the team&#x27;s financial problems continued. The group was given a deadline of June 1, 1975, to sell 4,000 season tickets, obtain new investors and arrange a more favorable lease for the team at the Mid-South Coliseum. However, the group did not come through and the ABA took over the team, selling it to a group in Maryland that renamed the team the Baltimore Hustlers and then the Baltimore Claws before the club finally folded during preseason play for the 1975–1976 season.

In 1976, the album cover of &quot;Juicy Fruit&quot; featured Hayes in a pool with naked women, and spawned the title track single and the classic &quot;Storm Is Over.&quot; Later the same year the &quot;Groove-A-Thon&quot; album featured the singles &quot;Rock Me Easy Baby&quot; and the title track. However, while all these albums were regarded as solid efforts, Hayes was no longer selling large numbers. He and his wife were forced into bankruptcy in 1976, as they owed over $6 million. By the end of the bankruptcy proceedings in 1977, Hayes had lost his home, much of his personal property, and the rights to all future royalties earned from the music he had written, performed, and produced.

===1977–1995: Polydor, hiatus, and film work===
In 1977, Hayes was back with a new deal with Polydor Records, a live album of duets with Dionne Warwick did moderately well, and his comeback studio album &quot;New Horizon&quot; sold better and enjoyed a hit single &quot;Out The Ghetto,&quot; and also featured the popular &quot;It&#x27;s Heaven To Me.&quot; 1978&#x27;s &quot;For the Sake of Love&quot; saw Hayes record a sequel to &quot;Theme from &quot;Shaft&quot;&quot; (&quot;Shaft II&quot;), but was best known for the single &quot;Zeke The Freak,&quot; a song that would have a shelf life of decades and be a major part of the House movement in the UK. The same year, Fantasy Records, which had bought out Stax Records, released an album of Hayes&#x27;s non-album singles and archived recordings as a &quot;new&quot; album, &quot;Hotbed&quot;, in 1978. In 1979, Hayes returned to the Top 40 with &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; and its disco-styled title track that became a hit single (U.S. #18), and also featured the classic &quot;A Few More Kisses To Go.&quot; Later in the year he added vocals and worked on Millie Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Royal Rappin&#x27;s&quot;, and a song he co-wrote, &quot;Deja Vu,&quot; became a hit for Dionne Warwick and won her a Grammy for best female R&amp;B vocal. Neither 1980s &quot;And Once Again&quot; or 1981&#x27;s &quot;Lifetime Thing&quot; produced notable songs or big sales, and Hayes chose to take a break from music to pursue acting.

In the 1970s, Hayes was featured in the films &quot;Shaft&quot; (1971) and &quot;Truck Turner&quot; (1974); he also had a recurring role in the TV series &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; as an old cellmate of Rockford&#x27;s, Gandolph Fitch (who always referred to Rockford as &quot;Rockfish&quot; much to his annoyance), including one episode alongside duet-partner Dionne Warwick. In the 1980s and 1990s, he appeared in numerous films, notably &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot; (1988), &quot;Prime Target&quot; (1991), and &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; (1993), as well as in episodes of &quot;The A-Team&quot; and &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. He also attempted a musical comeback, embracing the style of drum machines and synth for 1986s &quot;U-Turn&quot; and 1988s &quot;Love Attack&quot;, though neither proved successful. In 1991, he was featured in a duet with fellow soul singer Barry White on White&#x27;s ballad &quot;Dark and Lovely (You Over There).&quot;

===1995–2006: Return to prominence and &quot;South Park&quot;===
In 1995, Hayes appeared as a Las Vegas minister impersonating himself in the comedy series &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. He launched a comeback on the Virgin label in May 1995 with &quot;Branded&quot;, an album of new material that earned impressive sales figures as well as positive reviews from critics who proclaimed it a return to form. A companion album released around the same time, &quot;Raw &amp; Refined&quot;, featured a collection of previously unreleased instrumentals, both old and new. For the 1996 film &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;, he wrote a version of the &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; theme in the style of the &quot;Shaft&quot; theme.

Hayes joined the founding cast of Comedy Central&#x27;s animated TV series &quot;South Park.&quot; He provided the voice for the character of &quot;Chef&quot;, the amorous elementary-school lunchroom cook, from the show&#x27;s debut on August 13, 1997 (one week shy of his 55th birthday), through the end of its ninth season in 2006. The role of Chef combined his work both as an actor and as a singer, thanks to the character&#x27;s penchant for making conversational points in the form of crudely suggestive soul songs. A song from the series performed by Chef, &quot;Chocolate Salty Balls (P.S. I Love You),&quot; received international radio airplay in 1999. It reached number one on the UK singles chart and also on the Irish singles chart. The track also appeared on the album &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot; in 1998.

In 2000, Hayes appeared on the soundtrack of the French movie &quot;The Magnet&quot; on the song &quot;Is It Really Home&quot; written and composed by rapper Akhenaton (IAM) and composer Bruno Coulais. In 2002, Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. After he played a set at the 2002 Glastonbury Festival, a documentary highlighting Isaac&#x27;s career and his impact on many of the Memphis artists in the 1960s onwards was produced, &quot;Only The Strong Survive&quot;. In 2004, Hayes appeared in a recurring minor role as the Jaffa Tolok on the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. The following year, he appeared in the critically acclaimed independent film &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;. He also had a brief recurring role in UPN/The CW&#x27;s &quot;Girlfriends&quot; as Eugene Childs (father of Toni).

====&quot;South Park&quot; Scientology episode====

In the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Trapped in the Closet,&quot; a satire of Scientology that aired on November 16, 2005, Hayes did not appear in his role as Chef.
In an interview for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; on January 4, 2006, Hayes was asked about the episode. He said that he told the creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, &quot;Guys, you have it all wrong. We&#x27;re not like that. I know that&#x27;s your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know?&quot; He then told them to take a couple of Scientology courses to understand what they do. In the interview, Hayes defended &quot;South Park&quot;″s style of controversial humor, noting that he was not pleased with the show&#x27;s treatment of Scientology, but saying that he &quot;understands what Matt and Trey are doing.&quot;

====Departure from &quot;South Park&quot;====

On March 13, 2006, a statement was issued in Hayes&#x27;s name, indicating that he was asking to be released from his contract with Comedy Central, calling recent episodes that satirized religious beliefs intolerant. &quot;There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins&quot;, he was quoted as saying in the press-statement. However, the statement did not directly mention Scientology. A response from Stone said that Hayes&#x27;s complaints stemmed from the show&#x27;s criticism of Scientology and that he &quot;has no problem –and he&#x27;s cashed plenty of checks– with our show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons, or Jews.&quot;

On March 20, 2006, two days before the episode &quot;The Return of Chef&quot; aired, Roger Friedman of Fox News reported having been told that the March 13 statement was made in Hayes&#x27;s name, but not by Hayes himself. He wrote: &quot;Isaac Hayes did not quit &quot;South Park&quot;. My sources say that someone quit it for him. ... Friends in Memphis tell me that Hayes did not issue any statements on his own about &quot;South Park&quot;. They are mystified.&quot; In a 2016 oral history of &quot;South Park&quot; in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Hayes&#x27;s son Isaac Hayes III said the decision to leave the show was made by his father&#x27;s entourage, all of whom were ardent Scientologists, and that it was made after Hayes suffered a stroke, leaving him vulnerable to outside influence and unable to make such decisions on his own.

The first &quot;South Park&quot; episode that premiered after Hayes&#x27;s death, &quot;The China Probrem,&quot; was dedicated to him.

=== 2006–2008: Final years ===
Hayes&#x27;s income was sharply reduced as a result of leaving &quot;South Park&quot;. There followed announcements that he would be touring and performing. A Fox News reporter present at a January 2007 show in New York City, who had known Hayes fairly well, reported that &quot;Isaac was plunked down at a keyboard, where he pretended to front his band. He spoke-sang, and his words were halting. He was not the Isaac Hayes of the past.&quot;

In April 2008, while a guest on &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot;, Hayes stumbled in his responses to questions, possibly as a result of health problems. A caller questioned whether Hayes was under the influence of a substance, and Carolla and co-host Teresa Strasser asked Hayes if he had ever used marijuana. After some confusion on what was being asked, Hayes replied that he had only ever tried it once. During the interview the radio hosts made light of Hayes&#x27;s awkward answers, and replayed snippets of earlier ones to simulate conversation with his co-hosts. Hayes stated during this interview that he was no longer on good terms with Parker and Stone.

During the spring of 2008, Hayes shot scenes for &quot;Soul Men&quot;, a comedy inspired by the history of Stax Records, in which he appears as himself in a supporting role. The film was released in November 2008, after both Hayes and his costar, Bernie Mac, had died.

==Health problems and death==
On March 20, 2006, Roger Friedman of Fox News reported that Hayes had suffered a minor stroke in January. Hayes&#x27;s spokeswoman, Amy Harnell, denied this, but on October 26, 2006, Hayes confirmed he had suffered a stroke.

On August 10, 2008, at the age of 65, Hayes was found unresponsive in his home, just east of Memphis, as reported by the Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff&#x27;s Office. A Shelby County Sheriff&#x27;s deputy and an ambulance from Rural Metro responded to his home after three family members found his body on the floor next to a still-operating treadmill. Hayes was taken to Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, where he was pronounced dead at 2:08 p.m. The cause of death was not immediately clear, although the area medical examiners later listed a recurrence of stroke as the cause of death. Hayes was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery, in Memphis, Tennessee.

===Legacy===
The Tennessee General Assembly enacted legislation in 2010 to honor Hayes by naming a section of Interstate 40 the &quot;Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway.&quot; The name was applied to the stretch of highway in Shelby County from Sam Cooper Boulevard in Memphis east to the Fayette County line. The naming was made official at a ceremony held on Hayes&#x27;s birth anniversary in August 2010.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Hayes had 11 children, 14 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. His first marriage was to Dancy Hayes in 1960 and ended in divorce. His second marriage was to Emily Ruth Watson on November 24, 1965, which ended in divorce in 1972. Children from this marriage included Vincent Eric Hayes, Melanie Mia Hayes, and Nicole A. Hayes (Murrell). He married bank teller Mignon Harley on April 18, 1973, and they divorced in 1986; they had two children.
Hayes and his wife were eventually forced into bankruptcy, owing over $6 million. Over the years, Isaac Hayes was able to recover financially.

Hayes&#x27;s fourth wife, Adjowa, gave birth to a son named Nana Kwadjo Hayes on April 10, 2006.
He also had one son to whom he gave his name, Isaac Hayes III, known as rap producer Ike Dirty. Hayes&#x27;s eldest daughter is named Jackie, also named co-executor of his estate, and other children include Veronica, Felicia, Melanie, Nikki, Lili, Darius, Vincent and Heather.

===Scientology===
Hayes took his first Scientology course in 1993, later contributing endorsement blurbs for many Scientology books over the ensuing years.
In 1996, Hayes began hosting &quot;The Isaac Hayes and Friends Radio Show&quot; on WRKS in New York City. While there, Hayes became a client of the vegan raw food chef Elijah Joy and his company Organic Soul Inc. Hayes also appears in the Scientology film &quot;Orientation&quot;. In 1998, Hayes and fellow Scientologist entertainers Anne Archer, Chick Corea and Haywood Nelson attended the 30th anniversary of &quot;Freedom Magazine&quot;, the Church of Scientology&#x27;s self-described investigative news journal, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., to honor eleven activists. In 2001, Hayes and Doug E. Fresh, another Scientologist musician, recorded a Scientology-inspired album called &quot;The Joy of Creating – The Golden Era Musicians and Friends Play L. Ron Hubbard&quot;.

===Charitable work===
The Isaac Hayes Foundation was founded in 1999 by Hayes. In February 2006, Hayes appeared in a Youth for Human Rights International music video called &quot;United&quot;. YHRI is a human rights group founded by the Church of Scientology-backed non-profit United for Human Rights. He was also involved in other human rights related groups such as the One Campaign.
Isaac Hayes was crowned a chief in Ghana for his humanitarian work and economic efforts on the country&#x27;s behalf.

<doc id="165933" wikidata="Q2573187" url="?curid=165933" title="Mark Madsen (basketball)">
<text>Mark Ellsworth Madsen (born January 28, 1976) is an American basketball coach and former NBA player who is the head coach of the California Golden Bears of the ACC. Due to his hustle and physical style of play, he received the nickname &quot;Mad Dog&quot; while playing for the San Ramon Valley High School Wolves, and the moniker continued during his time with the Stanford Cardinal and beyond. He played professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Los Angeles Lakers, winning two NBA championships. He also played for the Minnesota Timberwolves.

==College career==
Madsen played NCAA basketball at Stanford, where he finished his career ranked in the school&#x27;s career top 10 in blocks and rebounds. In addition, Madsen helped the Cardinal to four NCAA tournament appearances, including a Final Four berth in 1998. Perhaps his signature moment at Stanford was his dunk and free throw that gave Stanford a lead over Rhode Island, propelling the team into the Final Four, where it lost to eventual champion Kentucky. Madsen was a two-time All-American and a two-time All-Pac-10 selection.

==Professional career==

=== Los Angeles Lakers (2000–2003) ===
The Los Angeles Lakers selected Madsen in the first round (29th pick overall) of the 2000 NBA draft. He contributed to the Lakers&#x27; NBA championships in 2001 and 2002, and became well known for his goofy dances at the victory parades for those championships.

Talking about his prime with the Lakers, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal said that the only player who could thwart him from his dominant play was Madsen. &quot;He used to beat me up in practice&quot;, O&#x27;Neal said.

=== Minnesota Timberwolves (2003–2009) ===
Madsen signed with the Timberwolves as a free agent before the start of the 2003–04 NBA season. He played six seasons for the Wolves.

On July 20, 2009, Madsen was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Craig Smith and Sebastian Telfair in exchange for Quentin Richardson. On August 21, 2009, he was waived by the Clippers.

Madsen&#x27;s final NBA game was played on April 15, 2009, in a 90–97 loss to the Sacramento Kings. In his final game, Madsen was the team&#x27;s starting power forward, but he played for only minutes and recorded no stats. His career averages were 2.2 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 0.4 assists in 11.8 minutes played per game.

==Coaching career==

=== Los Angeles D-Fenders (2013) ===
Following being waived, Madsen was hired as the assistant coach for the Utah Flash of the NBA Development League (D-League). In 2012, he was hired as an assistant coach at Stanford. On May 13, 2013, he was named head coach of the Los Angeles D-Fenders, a D-League team owned by the Los Angeles Lakers.

=== Los Angeles Lakers ===

On July 19, 2013, Madsen was promoted to a player development coach position with the Lakers. 
On September 16, 2014, Madsen was promoted to full-fledged assistant coach by Byron Scott. After Byron Scott was dismissed as head coach of the Lakers, new head coach Luke Walton retained Madsen as assistant coach on July 1, 2016.

=== Utah Valley (2019–2023) ===
Madsen was hired as the head coach at Utah Valley University on April 14, 2019.

=== California (2023–present) ===
Madsen was hired as the head coach at the University of California, Berkeley on March 29, 2023. Madsen is the 19th men&#x27;s basketball head coach in Cal history. On March 12, 2024, Madsen signed a two-year contract extension through the 2029–30 season.

==Personal life ==
Madsen is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Madsen speaks Spanish, acquiring the language from a two-year mission abroad in Málaga, Spain on behalf of his church following his graduation from high school.

As a youth, Madsen attained the rank of Eagle Scout and credits Scouting with teaching him about leadership, character and mentoring.

In fall 2010, Madsen enrolled in the Stanford Graduate School of Business. In June 2012, he received an M.B.A. degree with a Certificate in Public Management.

Madsen married Hannah Harkness on September 3, 2016. The Madsens have three boys and two daughters.

==Head coaching record==
===College===




# Due to irregularities in the WAC standings due to cancelled games resulted from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic throughout the season, Utah Valley and Grand Canyon were declared co-champions in the regular season as both teams had 9 wins in conference play. This was contrary to the fact Utah Valley finished with one extra loss and thus an inferior winning percentage in conference play.

<text>Brenda Mae Tarpley (born December 11, 1944), known professionally as Brenda Lee, is an American singer. Primarily performing rockabilly, pop, country and Christmas music, she achieved her first &quot;Billboard&quot; hit aged 12 in 1957 and was given the nickname &quot;Little Miss Dynamite&quot;. Some of Lee&#x27;s most successful songs include &quot;Sweet Nothin&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, &quot;I Want to Be Wanted&quot;, &quot;Speak to Me Pretty&quot;, &quot;All Alone Am I&quot; and &quot;Losing You&quot;. Her festive song &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot;, recorded in 1958, topped the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 2023, making Lee the oldest artist ever to top the chart and breaking several chart records.

Having sold over 100 million records globally, Lee is one of the most successful American artists of the 20th century. Lee was the second woman ever to top the Billboard Hot 100 (after Connie Francis) when her song “I’m Sorry” reached #1 in 1960. Her U.S. success in the 1960s earned her recognition as &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Female Artist of the Decade and one of the four artists who charted the most singles, behind Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Ray Charles. Her accolades include a Grammy Award, four NARM Awards, three &quot;NME&quot; Awards and five Edison Awards. She is the first woman to be inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. In 2023, she was named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the greatest singers of all time.

== Early life and education ==
Brenda Mae Tarpley was born on December 11, 1944 in the charity ward of Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia to parents Annie Grayce (née Yarbrough; 1921–2006) and Ruben Lindsey Tarpley (1909–1953). She weighed only 4 pounds 11 ounces at birth. Lee attended primary schools wherever her father found work, mainly between Atlanta and Augusta. Her family was poor. Growing up, she shared a bed with her brother and sister in a series of three-room houses without running water. Life centered on her parents finding work, their family and the Baptist church, where she began singing solos every Sunday.

Lee&#x27;s father was a farmer&#x27;s son in Georgia&#x27;s red-clay belt. Standing 5 ft 7 in (170 cm), he was an excellent left-handed pitcher and played baseball while serving for 11 years in the United States Army. Her mother came from a working class family in Greene County, Georgia.

Though her family did not have indoor plumbing until after her father&#x27;s death, they had a battery-powered table radio that fascinated Brenda as a baby. Both her mother and sister remembered taking her repeatedly to a local candy store before she turned three. One of them would stand her on the counter and she would earn candy or coins for singing.

== Career ==

===Child performer===
Lee&#x27;s voice, face and stage presence won her wider attention from a young age. At age five, she won first place at her school&#x27;s talent show contest, where she sang &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. Her performance received positive reviews, leading her to make regular appearances on local radio and television shows.

Her father died in 1953 (when she was 8 years old) in a construction accident and by the time she turned ten, she was the primary breadwinner of her family by singing at events and on local radio and television shows. During that time, she appeared regularly on the country music show &quot;TV Ranch&quot; on WAGA-TV in Atlanta but she was so short, the host would lower a stand microphone as low as it would go and stand her up on a wooden crate to reach it. In 1955, Grayce Tarpley married Buell &quot;Jay&quot; Rainwater, who moved the family to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he worked at the Jimmie Skinner Music Center. Lee performed with Skinner at the record store on two Saturday programs broadcast over Newport, Kentucky, radio station WNOP. The family soon returned to Georgia but this time to Augusta and Lee appeared on the show &quot;The Peach Blossom Special&quot; on WJAT-AM in Swainsboro.

===National exposure and stardom===
Lee&#x27;s breakthrough came in February 1955, when she turned down $30 ($334 in 2022 value) to appear on a Swainsboro radio station in order to see Red Foley and a touring promotional unit of his ABC-TV program &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; in Augusta. An Augusta disc jockey persuaded Foley to hear her sing before the show. Foley did and agreed to let her perform &quot;Jambalaya&quot; on stage that night, unrehearsed. Foley later recounted the moments following her introduction:

On March 31, 1955, the 10-year-old made her network debut on &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; in Springfield, Missouri. Although her five-year contract with the show was broken by a 1957 lawsuit brought by her mother and her manager, she nevertheless made regular appearances on the program throughout its run.

Less than two months later, on July 30, 1956, Decca Records offered her a contract, and her first record was &quot;Jambalaya&quot;, backed with &quot;Bigelow 6-200&quot;. Lee&#x27;s second single featured two novelty Christmas tunes: &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Lasso Santa Claus&quot;, and &quot;Christy Christmas&quot;. Though she turned 12 on December 11, 1956, both of the first two Decca singles credited her as &quot;Little Brenda Lee (9 Years Old)&quot;.

Neither of the 1956 releases charted, but her first issue in 1957, &quot;One Step at a Time&quot;, written by Hugh Ashley, became a hit in both the pop and country fields. Her next hit, &quot;Dynamite&quot;, coming out of a 4-foot 9-inch frame, led to her lifelong nickname, Little Miss Dynamite.

Lee first attracted attention performing in country music venues and shows; however, her label and management felt it best to market her exclusively as a pop artist, the result being that none of her best-known recordings from the 1960s were released to country radio, and despite her country sound, with top Nashville session people, she did not have another country hit until 1969 with &quot;Johnny One Time&quot;.

===Biggest successes: 1958–1966===

Lee achieved her biggest success on the pop charts in the late 1950s through the mid-1960s with rockabilly and rock and roll-styled songs. Her biggest hits included &quot;Jambalaya&quot;, &quot;Sweet Nothin&#x27;s&quot; (No. 4, written by country musician Ronnie Self), &quot;I Want to Be Wanted&quot; (No. 1), &quot;All Alone Am I&quot; (No. 3) and &quot;Fool #1&quot; (No. 3). She had more hits with the more pop-based songs &quot;That&#x27;s All You Gotta Do&quot; (No. 6), &quot;Emotions&quot; (No. 7), &quot;You Can Depend on Me&quot; (No. 6), &quot;Dum Dum&quot; (No. 4), 1962&#x27;s &quot;Break It to Me Gently&quot; (No. 2), &quot;Everybody Loves Me But You&quot; (No. 6), and &quot;As Usual&quot; (No. 12). Lee&#x27;s total of nine consecutive top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits from &quot;That&#x27;s All You Gotta Do&quot; in 1960 through &quot;All Alone Am I&quot; in 1962 set a record for a female solo artist that was not equaled until 1986 by Madonna.

In 1958, when Lee was 13, producer Owen Bradley asked her to record a new song by Johnny Marks, who had had success writing Christmas tunes for country singers, most notably &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; (Gene Autry) and &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; (Burl Ives). Lee recorded the song &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; in July with a prominent twanging guitar part by Hank Garland and raucous sax soloing by Nashville icon Boots Randolph. Decca released it as a single that November, but it sold only 5,000 copies, and did not do much better when it was released again in 1959. However, over subsequent years, it eventually sold more than five million copies. Since 2017, the song has appeared at the end of each year on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, having spent (as of December 9, 2023) 54 weeks on the Hot 100, peaking at number 1 in 2023.
In 1960, Lee recorded her signature song, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;. However, the record initially was withheld for months before its release due to concern that the 15-year-old Lee would not understand what she was singing about in the love song. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1960, reaching the #1 chart position in the U.S. and #12 in the U.K. It was her first gold single and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Even though it was not released as a country song, it was among the first big hits to use what was to become the Nashville sound – a string orchestra and legato harmonized background vocals. &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; was finally noticed in its third release a few months later, and sales snowballed; the song remains a perennial favorite each December and is the record with which she is most identified by contemporary audiences.

Her last top-ten single on the pop charts in the United States (besides the reappearance each November–December since 2017 of &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot;) was 1963&#x27;s &quot;Losing You&quot; (No. 6). 

In 1964, &quot;As Usual&quot; reached No. 12 in the US and No. 5 in the UK and &quot;Coming on Strong&quot; peaked at No. 11 in the US. Also in 1964, &quot;Is It True&quot; peaked at No. 17 in both the US and the UK. Featuring Big Jim Sullivan (guitar), Jimmy Page (guitar), and Bobby Graham (drums), it was her only hit single recorded in London, England, and was produced by Mickie Most. The slide guitar and background singers were overdubbed in Nashville. It was recorded at Decca Records&#x27; number two studio at their West Hampstead complex, as was the UK B-side, a version of Ray Charles&#x27; 1959 classic cut, &quot;What&#x27;d I Say?&quot; which was not released in North America. &quot;Is It True&quot; was composed by noted British songwriting team Ken Lewis and John Carter, who were also members of UK hitmakers the Ivy League.

===International fame===

Lee was popular in the United Kingdom from early in her career. She performed on British television in 1959, before she had achieved much pop recognition in the United States. Her first hit single in the United Kingdom was &quot;Sweet Nothin&#x27;s&quot;, which peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart in the spring of 1960. She subsequently had a UK hit (in 1961) with &quot;Let&#x27;s Jump the Broomstick&quot;, a rockabilly number recorded in 1959, which had not charted in the United States, but reached No. 12 in the UK.

Lee had two top ten hits in the UK that were not released as singles in her native country: the first, &quot;Speak to Me Pretty&quot; peaked at No. 3 in May 1962 and was her greatest hit in the UK by chart placing, swiftly followed by &quot;Here Comes That Feeling&quot;, which reached No. 5 in the summer of 1962. The latter was issued as the B-side to &quot;Everybody Loves Me But You&quot; in the United States (which peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100); however, &quot;Here Comes That Feeling&quot; also made an appearance in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 89, despite its B-side status in the US.

In 1962, while touring West Germany, Lee appeared at the Star-Club, Hamburg, with the Beatles as the opening act. Lee also had big hits in the UK with &quot;All Alone Am I&quot; (No. 7 in 1963) and &quot;As Usual&quot; (No. 5 in 1964).

Lee first visited the United Kingdom for three days in April 1959 as a last-minute replacement on &quot;Oh Boy!&quot;. She first toured the UK in March and April 1962 with Gene Vincent and Sounds Incorporated (as her backing group), and she toured the country for a second time in March 1963, this time supported by the Bachelors, Sounds Incorporated, Tony Sheridan, and Mike Berry.

Lee also toured in the Republic of Ireland in 1963 and appeared on the front cover of the Irish dancing and entertainment magazine &quot;Spotlight&quot; in April that year.

After appearing at the annual Royal Variety Performance before Queen Elizabeth II at the London Palladium on November 2, 1964, Lee toured the United Kingdom again in November and December 1964, supported by (amongst others) Manfred Mann, Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates, the John Barry Seven, Wayne Fontana &amp; the Mindbenders, Marty Wilde, the Tornados and Heinz Burt.

=== 1970–1992 ===

During the early 1970s, Lee re-established herself as a country music artist. In a 1996 memoir, television producer Sam Lovullo stated that Lee&#x27;s 1972 appearance on his variety show &quot;Hee Haw&quot; had been instrumental to her comeback. Lee earned a string of top ten hits in the United States on the country charts, the first of which was 1973&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Wins&quot;, which reached the top five that spring and became her last Top 100 pop hit, peaking at No. 70. The follow-up, the Mark James composition &quot;Sunday Sunrise&quot;, reached No. 6 on &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; Hot Country Singles chart that October. Other major hits included &quot;Wrong Ideas&quot; and &quot;Big Four Poster Bed&quot; (1974); and &quot;Rock on Baby&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s My Rock&quot; (both 1975).

After a few years of lesser hits, Lee began another run at the top ten with 1979&#x27;s &quot;Tell Me What It&#x27;s Like&quot;. Two follow-ups also reached the Top 10 in 1980: &quot;The Cowgirl and the Dandy&quot; and &quot;Broken Trust&quot; (the latter featuring vocal backing by the Oak Ridge Boys). A 1982 album, &quot;The Winning Hand&quot;, featuring Lee along with Dolly Parton, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson, was a surprise hit, reaching the top ten on the U.S. country albums chart. Her last well-known hit was 1984&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah, I Love Her So&quot; in duet with George Jones (Lee sang this song individually before and released it in 1960 on &quot;This Is...Brenda&quot;). In 1992, Lee recorded a duet (&quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;) with Willy DeVille on his album &quot;Loup Garou&quot;.

=== 2000–2016: Autobiography and Country Music Hall of Fame ===
Lee&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Little Miss Dynamite: The Life and Times of Brenda Lee&quot;, was published by Hyperion in 2002 ().

Lee&#x27;s most recent album release was a gospel collection in 2007. She no longer tours and rarely performs. Since the millennium, she has been involved with her work for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. On October 4, 2000, Lee inducted fellow country music legends Faron Young and Charley Pride into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Lee is often called upon to announce the annual inductees to the Country Music Hall of Fame and then officially present them with their membership medallions at a special ceremony every year. The most recent inductees announced by Lee were Randy Travis, Charlie Daniels and Fred Foster in 2016.

=== 2019–present: &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; 65th anniversary ===
Since &quot;Billboard&quot; modified its recurrent rules in 2012, Lee&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; has regularly returned to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since 2015. On the Hot 100 chart dated December 21, 2019, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; reached a new peak of #3 in the United States with 37.1 million streams and 5,000 digital sales sold. The following week it moved up to #2, where it remained for a second week. From 2019 to 2022, the song has re-peaked at #2, blocked from the top position by Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;.

In November 2023, to celebrate the song&#x27;s 65th anniversary, Lee released a music video featuring her lip-synching to the original recording at a house party with Tanya Tucker and Trisha Yearwood. Lee has also joined social media platform TikTok to promote the song, where she posts videos reminiscing about her song&#x27;s history and success.

On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart dated December 9, 2023, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; topped the Hot 100 for the first time in the United States becoming Lee&#x27;s third #1 hit and first since her 1960 single, &quot;I Want to Be Wanted&quot;. At 78, Lee became the oldest female artist and oldest artist overall to top the Hot 100, feats formerly held by Cher and Louis Armstrong, respectively. The week following, she held the number one spot, which also meant she surpassed her own age record, having turned 79 during the week ending December 16, 2023. Following two few weeks off number one, on the week ending January 6, 2024, she returned to number one for an additional week.

A Lee approved AI-generated Spanish language version &quot;Noche Buena y Navidad&quot; appeared on October 25, 2024.

In December 2024, Spotify revealed that &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; is among the Top 10 most streamed holiday songs of all time, reaching more than a billion downloads. The Recording Industry Association of America also certified &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; that month for 7× Platinum for US sales of 7 million copies of the digital single.

Also in December 2024, Lee was honored at the Tennessee State Capitol, where the song was named the Official Holiday Song of Tennessee. Legislation recognizing the song in this way was filed by Tennessee House of Representative member Jason Powell in December 2023. It passed the state legislature and was signed into law by Governor Bill Lee.

==Legacy and recognition==
On September 26, 1986, Lee was installed in the Atlanta Music Hall of Fame 5th Annual Awards Ceremony held at the Raddison Inn, Atlanta, Georgia. She was named among many other recording artists including: Riley Puckett, Gid Tanner, Dan Hornsby, Clayton McMichen and Boots Woodall. Lee reached the final ballot for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and 2001 without success but was finally voted into the Hall of Fame in 2002.

Celebrating over 50 years as a recording artist, in September 2006 she was the second recipient of the Jo Meador-Walker Lifetime Achievement award by the Source Foundation in Nashville. In 1997, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and is a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.

In 2008, her recording of &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; marked 50 years as a holiday standard, and in February 2009 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences gave Lee a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Lee at number 161 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

===Grammy Awards===
The Grammy Awards is an accolade by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) of the United States to recognize outstanding achievement in the music industry. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance arts: Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures). 
== Personal life ==
Lee met Charles Ronald &quot;Ronnie&quot; Shacklett in November 1962 at a concert by Bo Diddley and Jackie Wilson hosted at Nashville&#x27;s Fairgrounds Coliseum. They married less than six months later on April 24, 1963. Lee and Shacklett have two daughters and three grandchildren.

Lee is the cousin-by-marriage (by way of her mother&#x27;s second marriage) to singer Dave Rainwater from The New Christy Minstrels.

<text>Gene Francis Alan Pitney (February 17, 1940 – April 5, 2006) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician.

Pitney charted 16 top-40 hits in the United States, four in the top ten. In the United Kingdom, he had 22 top-40 hit singles, including 11 in the top ten. Among Pitney&#x27;s most famous hits are &quot;Town Without Pity&quot;, &quot;(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance&quot;, &quot;Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Strong&quot;, &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love&quot;, and &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotten Hold of My Heart&quot;. He also wrote the early-1960s hits &quot;Rubber Ball&quot; recorded by Bobby Vee, &quot;Hello Mary Lou&quot; by Ricky Nelson, and &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; by the Crystals. In 2002, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Pitney was born in Hartford, Connecticut, United States, on February 17, 1940, as the son of Anna A., née Orlowski, and Harold F. Pitney. The third of five children of a lathe operator, Pitney lived with his family in Rockville, Connecticut, during his formative years. He also grew up in Rockville, now part of Vernon, Connecticut.

Pitney&#x27;s early influences were Clyde McPhatter, and doo-wop groups such as The Crows. He attended Rockville High School where he formed his first band, Gene &amp; the Genials. Gene&#x27;s first recordings were in 1958 with a Connecticut singing group called the Embers. Those recordings were not released until 1990. In early 1959, he released two records on the Decca label, &quot;Snuggle Up Baby&quot; and &quot;Classical Rock and Roll&quot;, as part of a duo called Jamie and Jane with Ginny Arnell. Later that year, he had his first solo release &quot;Cradle Of My Arms&quot; under the name Billy Bryan on the Blaze record label. His first release under his real name was in 1960 on the Festival label titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Find You&quot;.

==Career==

===Rise to fame (1961–1964)===
Signed to songwriter Aaron Schroeder&#x27;s newly formed Musicor label in 1961, Pitney scored his first chart single, which made the Top 40, the self-penned &quot;(I Wanna) Love My Life Away&quot;, on which he played several instruments and multi-tracked the vocals. He followed that same year with his first Top 20 single, &quot;Town Without Pity&quot;, from the 1961 film of the same title. Written by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, the song won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song, but lost to &quot;Moon River&quot;. Pitney performed the song at the Oscars ceremony on April 9, 1962.

He is also remembered for the Burt Bacharach–Hal David song &quot;(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance&quot;, which peaked at #4 in 1962. Though it shares a title with the John Wayne western, the song was not used in the film because of a publishing dispute.

Meanwhile, Pitney wrote hits for others, including &quot;Today&#x27;s Teardrops&quot; for Roy Orbison, &quot;Rubber Ball&quot; for Bobby Vee, &quot;Hello Mary Lou&quot; for Ricky Nelson, and &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; for the Crystals (later recorded by Vikki Carr and Elkie Brooks). &quot;Rebel&quot; kept Pitney&#x27;s own #2 hit &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart&quot;, his highest-charting single in the US, from the top spot on 3 November 1962, the only time that a writer shut himself (or herself) out of the #1 position.

He followed up in December with &quot;Half Heaven, Half Heartache&quot;, which reached #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Because of his success on the music charts, and as he explained to his friend, oldies DJ &#x27;Wild&#x27; Wayne, an unknown radio disc jockey at the time gave Pitney the nickname &#x27;The Rockville Rocket&#x27;, which caught on.

Pitney&#x27;s popularity in the UK market was ensured by the breakthrough success of &quot;Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa&quot;, a Bacharach and David song, which peaked at #5 in Britain at the start of 1964. It was only Pitney&#x27;s third single release in the UK to reach the singles chart, and the first to break into the Top Twenty there; it was also a hit in the US, peaking at #17 on the Hot 100.

===Involvement with the Rolling Stones (1964)===
Pitney was present with Phil Spector at some of the Rolling Stones&#x27; early recording sessions in London, including &quot;Little by Little&quot; and other tracks for their debut album; he played piano, though the extent of this is uncertain.

The song &quot;That Girl Belongs to Yesterday&quot; was the very first Jagger/Richards composition to make the American music charts and also was #7 UK hit for Pitney in 1964. it was the first song composed by the Rolling Stones duo to become a Top 10 hit in the UK. In the US, the single stalled at #49, ending a run of seven Top 40 singles for Pitney as a performer.

===Maintaining popularity===
After another low-charting single, 1964&#x27;s &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot;, Pitney rebounded with another string of hits in the mid-1960s, including the 1964 singles &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Strong&quot;, which reached #7 and #9, respectively, in the US, and 1966&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Needs Your Love&quot;, which peaked at #2 in the UK, matching the #2 UK peak of &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Strong&quot;. &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love&quot; had been planned for and recorded by Neil Sedaka, but RCA refused to release it because Sedaka had recorded the song outside RCA Victor in violation of his contract. The writers, Howard Greenfield and Helen Miller, presented the song to Pitney. Miller replaced Sedaka&#x27;s voice with Pitney&#x27;s, though Sedaka&#x27;s trademark backing harmonies were left intact.

In 1965, Pitney recorded two successful albums with country singer George Jones. They were voted the most promising country-and-western duo of the year. Pitney also recorded songs in Italian, Spanish, and German and twice finished second in Italy&#x27;s prestigious annual Sanremo Music Festival, where his strong vibrato reminded older listeners of the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. He had a regional hit with &quot;Nessuno mi può giudicare&quot;.

Pitney&#x27;s career in the US took a downturn after mid-1966, when &quot;Backstage&quot; ended another run of Top 40 hits. He returned one last time to the Top 40 in April 1968 with &quot;She&#x27;s a Heartbreaker&quot; (#16) and placed several singles in the lower reaches of the Hot 100 after that, but by 1970 he was no longer a hit-maker in the United States.

===UK, Australian and European stardom (1966–1970s)===
Pitney maintained a successful career in Britain and the rest of Europe into the 1970s, appearing regularly on UK charts as late as 1974. UK pianist Maurice Merry was his musical director from 1970 onward. In Australia, after a fallow period in the early 1970s, Pitney returned to the Top 40 in 1974, when both &quot;Blue Angel&quot; (#2) and &quot;Trans-Canada Highway&quot; (#14; production by David Mackay) were substantial hits. Pitney continued to place records in the Australian charts through 1976, including the hit &quot;Down This Road&quot;, written and produced by distant relative Edward Pitney. They also collaborated in the production of the hit song &quot;Days of Summer&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Pitney decided to spend only six months each year on the road in order to spend more time with his family.

===Later career===
Pitney&#x27;s last hit on the UK charts came in 1989, after an absence of 15 years, when he and Soft Cell singer Marc Almond recorded a duet version of &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotten Hold of My Heart&quot; by British writers Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway. The song had been a UK #5 for Pitney in 1967. The duet brought him his first UK #1, in late January 1989. The single remained at the top for four weeks, and also went to #1 in Germany, Finland, Switzerland and Ireland. Pitney and Almond appeared on several episodes of Top of the Pops and the Terry Wogan television show in Britain.

In 2000, Pitney sang harmony vocals on Jane Olivor&#x27;s recording of his 1962 hit &quot;Half Heaven – Half Heartache&quot;, which was released on her &#x27;comeback&#x27; album &quot;Love Decides&quot;.

On 18 March 2002, Pitney was inducted by singer Darlene Love into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

====&quot;This Morning&quot; incident====
Pitney was involved in a gaffe on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; in 1989, owing to a &quot;technical mishap&quot;. Giving a performance of his track &quot;You&#x27;re the Reason&quot;, Pitney missed his cue and was seen &quot;failing dismally to mime along in time to his backing track&quot;; he continued with the song, and found humor in the incident. It has been repeated on television over the years, notably on a 2002 episode of BBC One series &quot;Room 101&quot;, in which host Paul Merton described it as a &quot;very funny moment&quot; in which Pitney came in &quot;unbearably late&quot;. It was re-aired on the 25th anniversary edition of &quot;This Morning&quot; in 2013, in which presenter Holly Willoughby &quot;broke out into a cold sweat&quot; while reliving the moment.

==Personal life==
At the height of his fame in 1967, Pitney married his childhood sweetheart, Lynne Gayton, and the couple had three sons, Todd, Christopher, and David.

===Death===
Pitney was touring the UK in the spring of 2006 when his manager found him dead in his hotel room following a concert in Cardiff, Wales, on April 5. An autopsy found the cause of death to be a heart attack and that he had severely occluded coronary arteries. His final show at Cardiff&#x27;s St David&#x27;s Hall had earned him a standing ovation; he ended with &quot;Town Without Pity&quot;. He was laid to rest at Somers Center Cemetery in Somers, Connecticut.

==Posthumous tributes==
Marc Almond recorded &quot;Backstage (I&#x27;m Lonely)&quot; for his 2007 covers album &quot;Stardom Road&quot;.

On September 20, 2007, a plaque to Pitney was unveiled at the town hall in his hometown of Rockville, Connecticut. Members of the family attended. The event was emceed by Oldies Radio DJ and Pitney friend &quot;Wild&quot; Wayne. Governor Jodi Rell also declared September 20, 2007, as Gene Pitney Day in the state of Connecticut. The Gene Pitney Commemorative Committee established a music scholarship in Pitney&#x27;s name. It is awarded annually to a Rockville High School student. In October 2008, an international fan convention was held in Rockville.

<doc id="165936" wikidata="Q1636067" url="?curid=165936" title="Lady Bird Lake">
<text>Lady Bird Lake (formerly, and still colloquially referred to as Town Lake) is a river-like reservoir on the Colorado River in Austin, Texas, United States. The City of Austin created the reservoir in 1960 as a cooling pond for a new city power plant. The lake, which has a surface area of , is now used primarily for recreation and flood control. The reservoir is named in honor of former First Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson.

Lady Bird Lake is the easternmost lake of a chain of reservoirs on the river, which is completely located in Texas, and should not be confused with the larger Colorado River located in the Southwestern United States. This chain, known locally as the Texas Highland Lakes, also includes Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, and Lake Austin.

==History==

The City of Austin constructed Longhorn Dam in 1960 to form Town Lake. The city needed the reservoir to serve as a cooling pond for the Holly Street Power Plant, which operated from 1960 until 2007.

Before 1971, the shoreline of Town Lake was mostly a mixture of weeds, unkempt bushes, and trash. Local television station KTBC referred to the lake as an &quot;eyesore&quot;. Some concerned Austinites led small projects to clean up the lake. Roberta Crenshaw, chair of the Austin Board of Parks and Recreation, purchased nearly 400 trees and shrubs in an effort to spearhead parkland development around the lake. During his two terms in office (1971–75), the Mayor of Austin, Roy Butler, led the Austin City Council to establish the Town Lake Beautification Committee, and he appointed Lady Bird Johnson as the project&#x27;s honorary chairman. Johnson&#x27;s involvement brought attention and money (including $19,000 of her own) to the Town Lake project, allowing for the planting of hundreds of shrubs and trees. The city also built a system of hike and bike trails along the shoreline of the lake.

On July 26, 2007, the Austin City Council passed a resolution authorizing the renaming of the reservoir from Town Lake to Lady Bird Lake in honor of Lady Bird Johnson, who had died earlier that month. Johnson had declined the honor of having the lake renamed for her while she was alive. In renaming the lake, the City Council recognized Johnson&#x27;s dedication to beautifying the lake and her efforts to create a recreational trail system around the lake&#x27;s shoreline.

In 2009, non-profit organization Keep Austin Beautiful launched &quot;Clean Lady Bird Lake&quot;. The program mobilizes thousands of community volunteers annually to conduct large-scale cleanups along the lake every other month and targeted cleanups throughout the year.

In 2014, a one-mile stretch of the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, named after a former Austin mayor and his wife, was paved to create a boardwalk.

On February 5, 2024, members of the Austin Police Department responded to the 300 block of West Cesar Chavez Street, where first responders recovered a dead body that had been discovered by civilians earlier, following a series of four other bodies recovered from the lake in 2023.

==Recreational uses==

Lady Bird Lake is a major recreation area for the City of Austin. The lake&#x27;s banks are bounded by the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, and businesses offer recreational watercraft services along the lakefront portion of the trail. Austin&#x27;s largest downtown park, Zilker Park, is adjacent to the lake, and Barton Springs, a major attraction for swimmers, flows into the lake.

The City of Austin prohibits the operation of most motorized watercraft on Lady Bird Lake. As a result, the lake serves as a popular recreational area for paddleboards, kayaks, canoes, dragon boats, and rowing shells. Austin&#x27;s warm climate and the river&#x27;s calm waters, nearly length and straight courses are especially popular with crew teams and clubs. Along with the University of Texas women&#x27;s rowing team and coeducational club rowing team, who practice on Lady Bird Lake year-round, teams from other universities (including the University of Wisconsin, the University of Chicago, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of Nebraska) train on Lady Bird Lake during Christmas holidays and spring breaks. 

Other water sports along the shores of the lake include swimming in Deep Eddy Pool, the oldest swimming pool in Texas, and Barton Springs Pool, a natural pool on Barton Creek which flows into Lady Bird Lake. Below Tom Miller Dam is Red Bud Isle, a small island formed by the 1900 collapse of the McDonald Dam that serves as a recreation area with a dog park and access to the lake for canoeing and fishing.

Swimming in Lady Bird Lake is illegal not due to poor water quality from the run-off from area streets, which is a false rumor, but rather due to several drownings as well as debris in the water from bridges and dams destroyed by floods in years past. The City of Austin enacted the ban in 1964, and the fine can be up to $500.

For the first time in August 2019, a toxic blue-green algae was found in the lake and reportedly killed at least 5 dogs who were exposed.

Music venues on the banks of Lady Bird Lake are home to a number of events year-round, including the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the fall, the Austin Reggae Festival and Spamarama in the spring, and many open-air concerts at Auditorium Shores on the south bank and Fiesta Gardens on the north bank. The Austin Aqua Festival was held on the shores of Lady Bird Lake from 1962 until 1998. The late Austin resident and blues guitar legend, Stevie Ray Vaughan played a number of concerts at Auditorium Shores and is honored with a memorial statue on the south bank.

===Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail and Boardwalk===


The Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, formerly the Town Lake Hike and Bike Trail, creates a complete circuit around Lady Bird Lake. It is one of the oldest urban Texas hike and bike paths. The trail is the longest trail designed for non-motorized traffic maintained by the City of Austin Parks and Recreation Department. A local nonprofit, The Trail Conservancy, is the Trail&#x27;s private steward and has made Trail-wide improvements by adding user amenities and infrastructure including trailheads and lakefront gathering areas, locally-designed jewel box restrooms, exercise equipment, as well as doing trailwide ecological restoration work on an ongoing basis. 

The Butler Trail loop was completed in 2014 with the public-private partnership 1-mile Boardwalk at Lady Bird Lake project, which was spearheaded by The Trail Conservancy. Construction on the $28 million project was completed during October 2012 – June 2014.

The trail is long and mostly flat, with 97.5% of it at less than an 8% grade. The trail&#x27;s surface is smooth and is mostly crushed granite except for a few lengths of concrete and a boardwalk on the South-side of the lake. A pedestrian bridge incorporated into the trail bridges Barton Creek. The Roberta Crenshaw Pedestrian Walkway spans Lady Bird Lake beneath MoPac Boulevard and provides the trail&#x27;s westernmost crossing of Lady Bird Lake.

The trail encompasses the Lou Neff Point Gazebo at the confluence of Barton Creek and Lady Bird Lake. It is listed as &#x27;Austin Art in Public Places&#x27;.

===Fishing===
Lady Bird Lake has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. The predominant fish species in Lady Bird Lake are largemouth bass, catfish, carp, and sunfish. Fishing is regulated, requiring a fishing license, and daily bag and length limits apply for most species.

A ban on the consumption of fish caught in the lake was issued by the City of Austin in 1990, as a result of excessively high levels of chlordane found in the fish. Although the use of chlordane as a pesticide was banned in the United States in 1988, the chemical sticks strongly to soil particles and can continue to pollute groundwater for years after its application. The ban on the consumption of fish caught in the lake was finally lifted in 1999.

==Drinking water uses==
The first water treatment facility in the City of Austin, the Thomas C. Green Water Treatment Plant, was built in 1925 to treat water from the Colorado River. The plant occupied just west of the principal downtown business district. The water treatment facility was decommissioned in late 2008.

<text>Sharon Rachel Osbourne (née Levy, later Arden; born 9 October 1952) is an English television personality, music manager, and author. She is married to heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne and came to prominence while appearing on &quot;The Osbournes&quot; (2002–2005), a reality television show that aired on MTV, which followed her family&#x27;s daily life. Osbourne later became a judge on television talent competition shows, including &quot;The X Factor&quot; (2004–2007, 2013, 2016–2017) and &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2007–2012).

Osbourne is credited with reviving her husband&#x27;s heavy metal career by founding the summer Ozzfest tour, which was held almost annually between 1996 and 2018. In light of her success managing her husband, she branched out into managing other acts, such as Gary Moore, Motörhead, Lita Ford, and The Smashing Pumpkins, through her company Sharon Osbourne Management. 

From 2003 to 2004, Osbourne hosted her own television talk show &quot;The Sharon Osbourne Show,&quot; which was syndicated to various US channels and also shown in the UK on Sky One&quot;.&quot; In 2010, she was a contestant on the NBC reality show &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, and became a co-host on the CBS talk show &quot;The Talk,&quot; hosting until her termination in 2021. In 2022, she joined TalkTV, hosting a prime time show also titled &quot;The Talk&quot;. In 2024, Osbourne appeared as a celebrity lodger on the twenty-third series of the ITV reality show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

Osbourne has released three autobiographies and two novels. Her first autobiography, &quot;Extreme&quot;, debuted at number one on the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; best-seller list.

== Early life ==

Sharon Rachel Levy was born on 9 October 1952 in London, United Kingdom, the daughter of music promoter and rock and roll entrepreneur, Don Arden (born Harry Levy) (1926–2007) and his wife, Hope (née Shaw, 1916–1999). She has a brother, David. Her mother was of Irish descent and her father was Ashkenazi Jewish.

Osbourne revealed she was surrounded by violence during her childhood and that it was a normal occurrence to see her father threatening someone, or brandishing a firearm. Osbourne&#x27;s father managed Black Sabbath and fired Ozzy Osbourne from the group. Levy subsequently began dating Ozzy, in 1979, and took over his management from the Arden organisation. Levy coordinated the recruitment of a backing band (Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley, and Lee Kerslake) for the recording of the &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; album and helped Ozzy launch what became a successful solo career. Arden resented his daughter for dating Ozzy and managing his career. In her memoir, Osbourne relates that he had robbed her, once tried to kill her, and once told Ozzy that she had tried to seduce him, to turn Ozzy against her. She soon lost contact with her father and did not speak to him for 20 years. In an interview in 2001, she commented that her father has never seen her children and that &quot;he never will&quot;. Osbourne had told her children that their grandfather was dead but they unknowingly saw him for the first time when Osbourne was shouting abuse at him on a street in Los Angeles. When asked who she was shouting at, she replied Tony Curtis. They were reunited in 2001 and he then had a role in their reality show, &quot;The Osbournes&quot;. In August 2004, Osbourne stated her father had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and she paid for his care in the last years of his life.

Osbourne&#x27;s relationship with her mother was also damaged. At the age of 17, Osbourne lost her virginity and realised two months later that she was pregnant. By her account, pressure from others, principally her mother, influenced her decision to have an abortion, which Osbourne has described as the biggest mistake in her life. While visiting her parents on a later occasion, her mother&#x27;s dogs attacked her and it was some time before her mother appeared to call them off. She was pregnant at the time and subsequently lost the baby. According to a 2009 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Hope Arden was a cold woman who became even stranger after a serious car accident, something which Osbourne said &quot;unhinged her&quot;. When Osbourne was informed of her mother&#x27;s death, she said &quot;Oh, what a shame&quot; and simply put the phone down.

==Career==
=== Ozzfest ===

A series of high-selling albums and world tours followed through the 1980s, eventually bringing about Ozzy&#x27;s popularity. In 1996, Osbourne created the Ozzfest summer touring festival. It went on to become a regular rock occasion and celebrated a 10th anniversary in 2006. By 2007, the ticket prices had reached £76 and Osbourne announced that the tickets would be free to allow more people the opportunity to attend the concert. Prior to the founding of Ozzfest, Osbourne approached Lollapalooza, another rock/pop festival, to request that Ozzy play at that year&#x27;s festival, only to be rejected and told that Ozzy was &quot;uncool&quot; and too drugged up. It was then that she decided to launch her own festival. Controversy ensued when she pulled the plug on Iron Maiden&#x27;s set three times in one performance. She also harassed the singer Bruce Dickinson, and threw eggs at the band.

=== Sharon Osbourne Management ===

In light of her success managing her husband, Osbourne branched out into managing other acts by creating Sharon Osbourne Management. The new company, with Osbourne as its sole employee, managed artists such as Gary Moore, Motörhead, Lita Ford, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Coal Chamber. She co-managed a band called Cube, with Cud guitarist Mike Dunphy. Cube were signed to Polydor Records but had limited success. She has also turned down career guidance requests from Fred Durst, Guns N&#x27; Roses, and Courtney Love.

=== Television work (2002–2007) ===

Osbourne gained celebrity status as one of the stars of MTV&#x27;s reality show, &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, which followed her family&#x27;s daily life and had a national audience. As the person who negotiated with MTV to screen the show, she is often credited with bringing about her husband&#x27;s emergence from heavy metal icon into mainstream celebrity. The show began airing in early 2002, and when, in July 2002, Osbourne was diagnosed with cancer, she insisted that filming should continue. The final episode of the show aired in the US on 21 March 2005. MTV&#x27;s British affiliate has been airing the show since 2003. The show brought MTV its highest ratings ever in both America and Britain.

The Osbournes&#x27; Beverly Hills home (made famous on the show) has since been sold and the Osbournes have taken up residence in another home in Beverly Hills. Her Beverly Hills home was later seen in &quot;The X Factor&quot; during series two. The show saw that Osbourne was responsible for the livelihood of 12 dogs and employs a dog walker named Cherie. From the mid-1990s until the end of &quot;The Osbournes&quot; in 2005, she was primarily based in Los Angeles with the rest of her family. Osbourne earned an estimated £11.5 million from &quot;The Osbournes&quot;.

In 2009, she was included in Yahoo!&#x27;s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the time period 2002–2005. In 2003, Osbourne became the host of her own television talk show, &quot;The Sharon Osbourne Show&quot;, which was syndicated to various US channels and also shown in the UK on Sky One. The show was meant to be a reflection of her personality and home life, similar to her reality show but with the inclusion of guest interviews and performances. During the episodes, she conducted some of her interviews on a giant bed. However, the ratings were never successful and critics panned her inability to perform the basic tasks required of a talk show host, such as reading cue cards and conducting interviews. The show was cancelled in early 2004 after one season.

In 2006, UK TV network ITV commissioned a new chat show, initially to be called &quot;Mrs Osbourne Presents&quot;, but eventually just named &quot;The Sharon Osbourne Show&quot;. Osbourne signed a deal with ITV for a reputed £2 million. The show began on Tuesday 29 August 2006, and was scheduled to run for six weeks in the 5 pm weekday timeslot. The premiere episode proved a close competition as the show received 1.9 million viewers with 17% share – 400,000 viewers (and 3% share) ahead of &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; on Channel 4. Her second show attracted 2.1 million viewers. However, ratings appeared to decrease after Channel 4 moved its game show &quot;Deal Or No Deal&quot;, hosted by Noel Edmonds, into the timeslot, with Osbourne managing 1.2 million viewers compared to &quot;Deal Or No Deal&quot;&#x27;s 2.9m.
Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; returned on Monday 25 September 2006 with 2.3 million viewers compared to Osbourne&#x27;s 1.6 million.

Osbourne was a judge and mentor on the UK&#x27;s &quot;The X Factor&quot; every year, from 2004 through to 2007. In the first series she mentored the 16–24s and chose Roberta Howett, Cassie Compton and Tabby Callaghan to represent her in the live rounds of the show. The best placed of these was Tabby, who finished third overall. The final was contested between Simon Cowell&#x27;s act Steve Brookstein and Louis Walsh&#x27;s act G4, with Steve winning. Osbourne&#x27;s outburst against Steve on the night of the final is widely credited with helping him to win, although according to her autobiography he was well ahead at all stages of the voting.

In the second series she mentored the 25-and-overs, and selected Andy Abraham, Brenda Edwards, Chico Slimani and Maria Lawson to contest the final rounds. Andy Abraham finished in second place to Louis Walsh&#x27;s act Shayne Ward. During this series, the judges were again required to bring the selected candidates to their homes. Osbourne chose her Beverly Hills home as a suitable location, which saw Osbourne inviting her neighbours and husband Ozzy Osbourne to attend live performances by the candidates. During Chico&#x27;s performance, he jumped into her functioning fountain with a live microphone, and proceeded to splash water.

Osbourne also appeared in the spin-off show &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot;. She was not required to choose her celebrity singing contestants but was selected to manage the 16–24s which were made up of Nikki Sanderson, Matt Stevens and Michelle Marsh.

In the third series of &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2006, she was mentoring the 25-and-overs, and selected Ben Mills, Dionne Mitchell, Robert Allen and Kerry McGregor. Kerry and Dionne were voted out in a double elimination on 28 October, Robert was voted out on 18 November and Ben was voted out on 9 December, sending Osbourne out of the competition. During the filming of the third series, Osbourne lived at the Dorchester Hotel in central London.

Osbourne was criticised for her outbursts on the show, where before a live show in series three she reportedly spoke out against &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; presenter Chris Tarrant, who was in the show&#x27;s audience prior to filming. Tarrant had made a joke about her husband Ozzy to which Osbourne took offence, but most of her outburst focused on criticising Tarrant&#x27;s recent infidelity to his wife Ingrid from whom he was in the process of separating. It was rumoured that Cowell, fellow judge and creator of the show, was displeased with her performance in series three, and was thinking of replacing her and Walsh for the next series. However, it was confirmed that Osbourne had been contracted to return for the fourth series of the show. She then appeared in the fourth series along with judges Cowell, Walsh and new judge, Dannii Minogue, and mentored the Girls category during the series.

During the first live show, aired on 20 October 2007, Osbourne walked out on the panel after learning of two of her own acts, Kimberley Southwick and Alisha Bennett, being in the bottom two. However, on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;, aired on 23 October 2007, Osbourne confirmed she would return on the next episode and stated that it is part of her personality to say things in the heat of the moment and not to contrive anything that she says. Two weeks into the live shows, a number of happy slapping videos of Emily Nakanda, the only other act in Osbourne&#x27;s category, appeared in the media, apparently showing her beating another teenaged girl. The resulting backlash resulted in Nakanda withdrawing from the show. On 17 November, Bennett was voted out of the competition, leaving Osbourne with no acts halfway through the series.

=== Later work (2007–present) ===

Osbourne joined the judging panel on the second season of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, along with Piers Morgan and David Hasselhoff, replacing Brandy Norwood. Osbourne later worked on the show with Howie Mandel and Howard Stern as judges and Nick Cannon as host.

The season premiered in the United States on 5 June 2007. In her first episode, Osbourne came into a conflict with Piers Morgan when she felt he judged a child contestant too harshly. She threatened to leave the show in the middle of filming, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t sign up for this&quot;, but was talked out of it. The incident was shown on air. Osbourne has since stayed with the show for its third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons. The new season was announced in a promotional video shown during a commercial break for season seven&#x27;s second live show. Osbourne initially stated that she will not return for the season, but later said that she was staying with the show &quot;for now&quot;. Following this, she announced she was quitting after a dispute with NBC and the producers of &quot;Stars Earn Stripes&quot; involving what she believed was disability discrimination against her son Jack.

On 6 June 2008, it was announced in a statement on behalf of Osbourne that she has decided to step down as an &quot;X Factor&quot; judge after four series on the show. The statement read &quot;Sharon would like to thank the wonderful British public for their enormous support during what&#x27;s been an exciting ride. She would also like to take this opportunity to thank Simon Cowell and ITV while wishing them all the best for the next series.&quot; A spokesman from ITV commented &quot;She has been a tremendous judge and mentor on the programme, but we respect her wish to leave and wish her the very best.&quot; Osbourne was replaced by Cheryl Cole. During an interview on &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;, broadcast on 22 February 2009, Osbourne admitted that the reason for her departure from &quot;The X Factor&quot; was her fractured relationship with Minogue. She stated &quot;I didn&#x27;t enjoy working with her at all and didn&#x27;t fancy the prospect of spending six months sitting next to her.&quot;

Osbourne hosted the second season of &quot;Rock of Love: Charm School&quot; with co-hosts Riki Rachtman and Daniella Clarke on VH1. Osbourne had a physical altercation on 13 December 2008 with contestant Megan Hauserman on the reunion special for the show after Hauserman made derogatory statements about Osbourne&#x27;s husband, Ozzy. Hauserman reportedly filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department and has since filed a lawsuit against Osbourne, claiming battery, negligence and infliction of emotional distress. In 2011, Osbourne reached a settlement with Hauserman. In July 2008, Fox announced that the Osbourne family would be hosting a new variety show titled &quot;&quot; (working title was &quot;Osbournes: Loud and Dangerous&quot;). The show started filming at CBS Studios in Hollywood in December 2008 before a live audience. The show premiered in March 2009. Fremantle Media North America is producing the show. The show was cancelled after its premiere episode. In March 2010, Osbourne appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, coming in third place.

From its inception on 18 October 2010 until her departure in 2021, Osbourne co-hosted the CBS talk show &quot;The Talk&quot;. This decision came after CBS cancelled the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. The show is similar to &quot;The View&quot; and seeks to address motherhood and other contemporary issues. Osbourne was the last original co-host following the departure of fellow co-host and series creator Sara Gilbert.

In September 2010, Osbourne made a return to &quot;The X Factor&quot; at the Judges&#x27; Houses round of series 7 where she assisted Walsh at Adare Manor, County Limerick, Ireland to pick the final 3 contestants of the Over 28s category, Then in September 2012, she joined Walsh again this time in Las Vegas, for the 9th series Judges&#x27; Houses segment of the competition, to help him choose his final 3 groups.

Osbourne has expressed interest in reprising her role on the judging panel, notably in September 2012, when she said that she would &#x27;love&#x27; to return for the show&#x27;s tenth series. Media outlets reported in December 2012 that &quot;X Factor&quot; producers had approached Osbourne for a return in 2013, reportedly to replace Tulisa. In April 2013, the show&#x27;s creative director Brian Friedman said that he was &quot;confident&quot; of Sharon Osbourne&#x27;s return, following her departure from &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and replacement by Heidi Klum. It was later announced by ITV that Osbourne would indeed be returning for the tenth series of the show, replacing Tulisa. She returned to the judging panel alongside Gary Barlow, Nicole Scherzinger, and original panellist Walsh. During the live shows, she mentored the Over 25s category which included Lorna Simpson, Shelley Smith and Sam Bailey. Bailey was eventually announced as the winner of the show on 15 December, marking Osbourne&#x27;s first victory as a mentor in the show&#x27;s ten-year history. Osbourne did not return for the eleventh series of &quot;The X Factor UK&quot; and was replaced by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini.

In 2014 and 2017, Osbourne appeared as a guest panellist on ITV&#x27;s daytime programme &quot;Loose Women&quot;.

On 1 June 2016, it was announced that once again, Osbourne would return to &quot;The X Factor&quot; for the show&#x27;s thirteenth series to replace Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. She judged alongside Cowell, Walsh (who replaced Nick Grimshaw) and Scherzinger (who replaced Rita Ora). She once again mentored the Over 25s category, choosing Saara Aalto, Relley C and Honey G as her final three contestants. Aalto went on to become the series&#x27; runner-up. Although initially casting doubt on returning for another series due to her commitments with &quot;The Talk&quot;, Osbourne returned to &quot;The X Factor&quot; for the fourteenth series. This time she again mentored the Girls category; her last act Grace Davies finished as the runner-up. Osbourne was initially confirmed to return for the fifteenth series as the fifth judge during the live shows portion of the competition but later declined the offer to return, feeling she wasn&#x27;t needed on the panel and was replaced by Ayda Field.

In 2020, she portrayed herself in season 5, episode 2 of &quot;Lucifer&quot;.

In March 2022, Osbourne joined TalkTV hosting a new weekly prime time show named &quot;The Talk&quot;.

=== Writing ===
Sharon Osbourne&#x27;s first autobiography, &quot;Extreme&quot; (co-authored by Penelope Dening), was published in October 2005 and tells of her difficult childhood growing up with her father, Don Arden, and also documents the highs and lows of her marriage to husband Ozzy Osbourne, shedding light on areas of her life previously not commented on. Domestic violence, drug abuse, alcoholism, affairs, bribery, colon cancer, robberies, a plane crash, therapy, and cosmetic surgery are also documented in the autobiography.

Published by Time WarnerBooks, it went to Number 1 on the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Bestseller List (UK) where it remained for 15 weeks and sold over 621,000 copies in hardback, becoming the biggest-selling autobiography since British records began, beating the previous record set by David Beckham&#x27;s autobiography by 100,000 copies. In March 2006 it won Biography of the Year at the British Book Awards. The autobiography has proceeded to sell in excess of two million copies which has become the most successful female autobiography ever.

Osbourne later released another autobiography named &quot;Survivor&quot;, the title coming from surviving cancer. It was released in 2007. In August 2013, Osbourne announced on Twitter that her third autobiography named &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, would be released on 10 October 2013.

== In the media ==

In January 2003, Osbourne and the rest of her family hosted the 30th Annual American Music Awards. The night was marked with constant &quot;bleeping&quot; due to some of the lewd and raunchy remarks made by both Osbourne and Ozzy. Additionally, the night was met with some controversy, as critics panned their hosting and presenter Patricia Heaton walked out midway in disgust.

In January 2005, she was contracted to feature in a television advertising campaign for UK supermarket chain, Asda and later in 2007, Osbourne became the new face of &quot;Galabingo&quot; when she was featured in television advertisements promoting the gambling website. She has co-hosted one of the &quot;Royal Variety Performances&quot; with Jonathan Ross. Osbourne appeared in &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Boy Girl Thing&quot;.

On Friday 15 June 2007, Osbourne guest hosted &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot; with Justin Lee Collins and Alan Carr. Osbourne also made a cameo appearance on 23 June 2007 in an episode of the science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The episode &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; saw her appearing in a spoof party political broadcast, which featured testimonials from British celebrities such as Osbourne and the band McFly showing their support for Mr Saxon to become prime minister.

On 20 February 2008, Sharon Osbourne co-hosted the 28th edition of the BRIT Awards at Earls Court in London, along with her husband and daughter Kelly. During the awards Osbourne caused controversy and sparked complaints by calling Vic Reeves, who was presenting one of the awards, a &quot;piss head&quot; and a &quot;bastard&quot; after he appeared to be drunk, although he claimed that he was having trouble reading the autocue. On 22 August 2008, Osbourne took part in the 2008 MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival in Scotland. In 2009 she co-hosted WWE Raw with her husband Ozzy.

On 1 April 2010, Sharon Osbourne (along with Kelly Osbourne) joined Cyndi Lauper in the launch of her Give a Damn campaign to bring a wider awareness of discrimination of the LGBT community as part of her True Colors Fund. The organisation campaigns to urge straight people to stand up with the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community and stop discrimination. Other names included in the campaign are Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Mraz, Elton John, Judith Light, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Kardashian and Clay Aiken. Anna Paquin is also part of the campaign and came out as bisexual. This news clogged the Give A Damn website.

Osbourne has a recurring voice role as Mama Hook in the animated television series &quot;Jake and the Never Land Pirates&quot;, which was broadcast in 2012.

In 2016, Osbourne appeared in two videos for PETA, explaining why she gave up wearing fur and encouraging others to do the same.

===Public image===
On the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2006&quot;, Osbourne was listed as the 44th richest woman in Britain and the 60th richest woman on the 2007 list. In the overall British list in 2006, Osbourne and her husband appeared together as the 554th richest people with a combined wealth of £100 million. As of 2008, the couple was ranked as the 724th richest people in Britain with an estimated joint wealth of £110 million.

Osbourne has sent her son&#x27;s or daughter&#x27;s feces in Tiffany boxes on more than one occasion to people she felt had unreasonably criticised her or her family. When a journalist criticised her teenage children, Osbourne sent a box of excrement with a note saying, &quot;I heard you&#x27;ve got an eating disorder. Eat this.&quot;

The popular British comedy &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, features and spoofs Osbourne (played by Jan Ravens) quite prominently alongside her husband (played by Jon Culshaw). Also, she was spoofed by impressionist Ronni Ancona on &quot;Alistair McGowan&#x27;s Big Impression&quot; and was also featured in comedy &quot;2DTV&quot;. On &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Amy Poehler played her on &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; skit on 14 May 2005.

Sharon Osbourne appeared in season nine of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. On 16 May 2010, she was fired during the double elimination round. Impressionist Francine Lewis performed an impression of her in the seventh series of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

=== Controversies ===
==== Iron Maiden ====
At Iron Maiden&#x27;s last Ozzfest performance, on 20 August 2005 at the Hyundai Pavilion at Glen Helen in San Bernardino, California, several negative events took place, allegedly the fault of Sharon Osbourne. Osbourne&#x27;s actions were reportedly in retaliation to lead singer Bruce Dickinson slighting reality TV, with claims that this was an attack on Ozzy Osbourne himself.

During the first Iron Maiden song, several members of the front row of the crowd (reportedly a combination of Osbourne&#x27;s entourage and a few members from other bands persuaded by Osbourne or her entourage) were reported to have bombarded the band with eggs, bottle caps, and ice. Some reports also say that Sharon&#x27;s daughter, Kelly, was throwing objects at the band. During three of Iron Maiden&#x27;s songs, the PA system was switched off, cutting power to Dickinson&#x27;s microphone and the band&#x27;s instruments. In audio captured during the concert, it is reported that Dickinson can be heard accusing the festival&#x27;s organisers of deliberately cutting off the band&#x27;s power. Also unknown to Iron Maiden, played secretly through the PA at the very beginning and end of their set was a tape with the chant &quot;Ozzy – Ozzy – Ozzy&quot;. On Iron Maiden&#x27;s departure, Sharon made a few statements on stage in front of the 40,000 people in attendance. She told the audience that while she &quot;absolutely loved Iron Maiden,&quot; she thought lead singer Bruce Dickinson was a &quot;prick&quot; and had &quot;disrespected Ozzfest since they began their stint with the tour.&quot; Her words were met with booing, and soon afterwards she walked off the stage.

Iron Maiden&#x27;s manager, Rod Smallwood, issued a statement shortly after the debacle condemning the attack on the band as &quot;vile, dangerous, criminal and cowardly&quot; as well as disrespectful to fans who had paid to see the band perform &quot;a full unhindered performance.&quot;. Dickinson later denied making a personal attack on Ozzy Osbourne; &quot;Did I have a go at Ozzy and Black Sabbath? No. Why would I? But I do find &quot;The Osbournes&quot; TV series loathsome, and the whole cult of reality TV celebrities disgusting.&quot;

==== The Smashing Pumpkins ====
In 2000, Osbourne resigned from managing The Smashing Pumpkins by releasing a memo which said, &quot;It was with great pride and enthusiasm that I took on management of the Pumpkins back in October, but unfortunately I must resign today due to medical reasons ... [The Smashing Pumpkins frontman] Billy Corgan was making me sick!!!&quot; In an October 2008 interview, Osbourne revealed that she and Corgan had recently made up: &quot;I saw him at the Scream Awards. We hadn&#x27;t seen each other since that whole thing in Germany. The first time we ran into each other and we hugged and kissed and laughed.&quot;

==== &quot;The Talk&quot; ====
In July 2011, Osbourne and some of her fellow &quot;The Talk&quot; panellists were criticised for their conduct when discussing the story of Catherine Kieu. Osbourne described Kieu&#x27;s cutting off of her husband&#x27;s penis and putting it in a garbage disposal as &quot;quite fabulous&quot;, Osbourne also laughed about the incident with her fellow panellists and members of the audience. Osbourne&#x27;s cohost Sara Gilbert offered the counterpoint &quot;Not to be a total buzz kill, but it is a little bit sexist. If somebody cut a woman&#x27;s breast off, nobody would be sitting laughing.&quot; Osbourne replied by saying &quot;It&#x27;s different&quot;. Osbourne later apologised for her behaviour, stating &quot;she was sorry she offended people&quot; and that she &quot;did not condone genital mutilation&quot;.

Osbourne&#x27;s co-hosts on &quot;The Talk&quot;, Leah Remini and Holly Robinson Peete were released from their contracts in 2011. Osbourne spoke of their dismissals in December 2011 on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, stating: &quot;Some people don&#x27;t really know who they are, and you have to know who you are when you&#x27;re in something like this. You can&#x27;t pretend to be something you&#x27;re not. You have to know your brand. You can&#x27;t be all things to everyone.&quot; Remini later protested her dismissal and levelled accusations aimed at Osbourne through a series of tweets.

On 10 March 2021, whilst speaking on &quot;The Talk&quot;, Osbourne defended Piers Morgan&#x27;s negative comments towards Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, resulting in a heated exchange with co-host Sheryl Underwood. Osbourne&#x27;s behaviour towards Underwood during the argument was criticised as harsh and aggressive. In the same month, a 2018 clip from &quot;The Talk&quot; resurfaced in which Osbourne was discussing the Duchess of Sussex&#x27;s skin colour. Osbourne said that Markle &quot;ain&#x27;t Black&quot; and that &quot;she doesn&#x27;t look Black&quot;. In response, &quot;The Talk&quot; went on hiatus while CBS conducted a review on Osbourne. In a statement made 26 March 2021, CBS concluded that Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;behavior toward her co-hosts during the March 10 episode did not align with [CBS] values for a respectful workplace&quot;. Ultimately, Osbourne decided to depart from the program.

In the midst of her scandal and termination from &quot;The Talk&quot;, both Holly Robinson Peete and Leah Remini, Osbourne&#x27;s former cohosts, took to social media to reproach Osbourne over her conduct in relation to her removal from the show, pointing out that they had been treated similarly by her, citing additional acts of discriminatory behaviours from her towards additional cast members. Osbourne responded with threats of defamation lawsuits against both Peete and Remini, but ultimately did nothing.

==== Fired assistant revelation ====
In 2019, Osbourne appeared on the British panel show &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; in which guests make statements about themselves and fellow panellists guess whether or not the statements are true. She claimed that during a house fire she made her assistant go back into the house to save pieces of art. She also claimed that she ripped an oxygen mask off the assistant and gave it to her dog. She then proceeded to fire him when he did not find the situation funny, believing he might have lung damage from smoke inhalation, saying &quot;he showed absolutely no sense of humour&quot; during the fire. After the usual deliberations by fellow panellists, she confirmed the incident to be true. 

The clip of Osbourne&#x27;s story on the show that was uploaded by the official BBC YouTube Channel was met with an overwhelmingly negative reception. There was also a considerable backlash from Twitter users. Following the backlash, Osbourne backtracked on her claims on &quot;The Talk&quot; in January 2020. She said: &quot;I told a true story about a fire I had in my house. He went in, he got the paintings out. And then, just to be precocious, I said at the end of this little thing I was doing, &#x27;Oh, and then I fired him.&#x27; It was a joke because I was on a comedy show. I fired him about 15 years later.&quot; Her response was met with scepticism.

==Personal life==
=== Family ===
Sharon Osbourne (then Sharon Levy) met her future husband Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, at the age of 18, while working for her father, Don Arden (born Harry Levy), who was managing Black Sabbath at the time. When Ozzy was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Sharon started to date him and took over his management as a solo artist. The two were married in Maui, Hawaii, on 4 July 1982. Together, Sharon and Ozzy have three children: Aimee (1983), Kelly (1984) and Jack (1985). Before her successful pregnancies Osbourne had tried three times previously to have children with her husband, each resulting in a miscarriage. Afterwards she had an operation to deal with cervical weakness. The first miscarriage happened after she was attacked by her parents&#x27; two dogs. Osbourne attributed her weak cervix to an abortion she had at age 17, which she regrets and felt her mother coerced her into having.

In July 2002, after colon cancer claimed the life of Reagan Erin Marcato, the mother of then-18-year-old son Robert who was a friend of Osbourne&#x27;s daughter Kelly, Osbourne told the BBC that she had adopted Robert; however, when he was later sent to live with his biological father following a nervous breakdown, Osbourne denied having legally adopted him.

=== Health ===
Osbourne had dealt with bulimia for many years. In 1999, Osbourne lost after lap-band surgery (adjustable gastric band). Osbourne commented that being large was an essential part of her persona when she worked for her father and that when she was larger, she made a more dramatic entrance. On 26 October 2006, she went on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and revealed that she gained 15 pounds in the last year and would be having her plastic band removed.

In July 2002, Osbourne had surgery for cancer. She announced it was colon cancer and had spread to her lymph nodes and was more serious than originally thought. She survived the disease against a 33% survival prognosis. Despite battling cancer, she insisted that the MTV cameras document her illness during the filming of the second season of &quot;The Osbournes&quot;. When Osbourne&#x27;s hair fell out during her subsequent treatment, her wigs were custom made by Cher&#x27;s wigmaker. Ozzy Osbourne admitted that he &quot;fell apart&quot; during her treatment and recovery, and it was revealed that her son, Jack Osbourne, tried to commit suicide because of his depression stemming from his mother&#x27;s condition.

In August 2004, she founded the Sharon Osbourne Colon Cancer Program at Cedars Sinai Hospital. In addition, she was the honoured guest at the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation&#x27;s 2003 Fall Gala, where she spoke of her struggle against cancer. Osbourne has lent her support to design limited edition T-shirts or vests for the &#x27;Little Tee Campaign&#x27; for Breast Cancer Care which donates money for breast cancer research.

Osbourne has freely admitted to having extensive cosmetic surgery. As well as documenting this in her autobiography, she appeared on &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; on 14 December 2006, and commented on everything that had been surgically changed on her body to improve her appearance. She stated that she had had a full rhytidectomy, abdominoplasty, mastopexy, as well as many other procedures, but commented that she would not have any surgery performed on her eyes or lips. She has admitted to spending £300,000 on plastic surgery.

In early November 2012, Osbourne revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy after learning she had a gene that increases the risk of developing breast cancer.

=== Household incidents ===
For years, the Osbourne marriage was plagued by alcohol, drug use, and violence, with Osbourne having even been arrested for driving while intoxicated. The couple used to physically fight regularly and, according to Osbourne, they would &quot;beat the shit out of each other.&quot; She has described herself as &quot;a beaten woman&quot; when she was at the hands of husband Ozzy where he once knocked out her front teeth. She once retaliated by throwing a full bottle of scotch at his head. The most notorious incident arose in August 1989, when Ozzy was arrested for attempted murder after he had returned from the Moscow Music Peace Festival, and tried to strangle his wife in a haze of alcohol and drugs. After the incident, Ozzy spent six months in rehabilitation as a result of his actions, after which time Sharon Osbourne said she regained her strength in their relationship and did not press charges.

In 2004, Osbourne&#x27;s home in Jordans, Buckinghamshire, was burgled by a man who stole gems worth £2 million. The burglar managed to get away with the gems despite being put in a headlock by Ozzy. Items taken during the burglary included wedding rings, an engagement ring, pearl and diamond necklaces, a large 52 carat (10g) sapphire ring and two pairs of diamond earrings. After the incident, Osbourne appeared on &quot;Crimewatch&quot; and offered a reward of £100,000 for the return of her valuable jewellery. 

In March 2005, there was an incident in the Osbournes&#x27; mansion in Jordans, Buckinghamshire. Ozzy and Sharon were forced to flee their mansion when a blaze broke out as they slept. They were not injured but had to be treated for smoke inhalation. In 2006, another fire broke out at the Osbourne&#x27;s mansion; however, none of the family was at home.

In February 2024, Osbourne revealed that she tried to take her own life in 2016 after learning of her husband’s affair with hairdresser Michelle Pugh.

<text>Neurilemma (also known as neurolemma, sheath of Schwann, or Schwann&#x27;s sheath) is the outermost nucleated cytoplasmic layer of Schwann cells (also called neurilemmocytes) that surrounds the axon of the neuron. It forms the outermost layer of the nerve fiber in the peripheral nervous system.

The neurilemma is underlain by the myelin sheath (also known as the medullary sheath). In the central nervous system, axons are myelinated by oligodendrocytes, thus lack neurilemma. The myelin sheaths of oligodendrocytes do not have neurilemma because excess cytoplasm is directed centrally toward the oligodendrocyte cell body.

Neurilemma serves a protective function for peripheral nerve fibers. Damaged nerve fibers may regenerate if the cell body is not damaged and the neurilemma remains intact. The neurilemma forms a regeneration tube through which the growing axon re-establishes its original connection.

Neurilemoma is a tumor of the neurilemma.

<text>Freedom Air (legally &quot;Freedom Air International&quot;) was a New Zealand low-cost airline which operated since 8 December 1995 to March 2008. It was part of the Air New Zealand Group which ran scheduled passenger services from New Zealand to Australia and Fiji and charter services within New Zealand. Its main hub was Auckland Airport.

==History==

The airline was established in 1995 as a response to the commencement of discount services between Australia and New Zealand by Kiwi Travel International Airlines and started operations on 8 December 1995 with a single Boeing 757-200. It was ordinally formed as South Pacific Air Charters by Mount Cook Airline and renamed to Freedom Air International in 1998.

By 2004, its fleet had expanded to five Boeing 737-300 aircraft and it was providing direct non-stop services to the Australian cities of Brisbane, Gold Coast, Newcastle, Sydney and Melbourne from Hamilton, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Palmerston North. Flights to Fiji were also operated. It briefly operated on the New Zealand main trunk domestic routes such as Auckland–Christchurch, but ceased these services to concentrate on providing value trans-Tasman flights.

In June 2006, the aircraft from Freedom Air were combined with Air New Zealand&#x27;s fleet of Airbus A320-200 under the air operator&#x27;s certificate of Zeal320, which was then the sole operator of the Air New Zealand Group&#x27;s Airbus fleet. When the airline ceased Zeal320 had one aircraft painted in Freedom Air livery. As such, Freedom Air has no aircraft or current air operator&#x27;s certificate, and Freedom Air is no longer an operational entity.

Air New Zealand ceased all Freedom Air operations from the end of March 2008.

==Destinations==
Throughout its existence, Freedom Air flew to six destinations in New Zealand, five in Australia and one in Fiji. When the airline shut down on 30 March 2008, all services were replaced by Air New Zealand flights, with the exception of flights out of Palmerston North, which left the airport without any international services. Flights to Nadi and Newcastle were withdrawn prior to 2008.
**Brisbane – Brisbane Airport
**Gold Coast – Gold Coast Airport
**Melbourne – Melbourne Airport
**Newcastle – Newcastle Airport
**Sydney – Sydney Airport
**Nadi – Nadi International Airport
**Auckland – Auckland Airport (Hub)
**Christchurch – Christchurch Airport
**Dunedin – Dunedin Airport

<doc id="165953" wikidata="Q649352" url="?curid=165953" title="Public holidays in Germany">
<text>By law, &quot;the Sundays and the public holidays remain protected as days of rest from work and of spiritual elevation&quot; (Art. 139 WRV, part of the German constitution via Art. 140 GG). Thus all Sundays are, in a manner, public holidays – but usually not understood by the term &quot;holiday&quot; (except for, normally, Easter Sunday and Pentecost Sunday).

Public holidays apart from the Sundays (there must be some of them constitutionally) can be declared by law either by the Federation or by the Länder for their respective jurisdictions. At present the only federal holiday is German Unity Day (Unity Treaty, Art. 2 sect. 2); all the other holidays, even those celebrated all over Germany, are prescribed by state legislation.

== List by state ==


=== Notes ===
✔ – Public holiday is celebrated in that state.
In addition, the state of Brandenburg formally declared Easter Sunday and Pentecost Sunday as public holidays. As these are Sundays anyway, they have been left out by the other states, nor counted in the table above (the state of Hesse even declared all Sundays public holidays).

== Quiet days ==
A couple of days are designated as stille Tage (&quot;quiet days&quot;) by state legislation, which regularly means that public dancing or sport events, music at inns (if live or if not much quieter than usual) etc. are prohibited.

Some public holidays or commemorations are quiet days:
* Ash Wednesday (in Bavaria)
* Holy Thursday (in some states; in some of them beginning in the evening)
* Good Friday
* Holy Saturday (in some states)
* Buß- und Bettag (where it is a public holiday and in a couple of other states)
* All Saints&#x27; Day (where it is a public holiday)
* All Souls&#x27; Day (in Lower Saxony and the Saarland)
* Volkstrauertag 
* Totensonntag (the last Sunday of the Protestant liturgical year)
* Christmas Eve (beginning in the afternoon, in some states)

The status of quiet days is also given to festivities joyous in nature: in Hesse, the highest Christian holidays are half-quiet days (until midday) and in Rhineland-Palatinate, Easter Sunday and Christmas Day are two-thirds-quiet days (until 4 pm). For details see the German article on the &quot;Tanzverbot&quot; (&quot;dancing ban&quot;).

== Flag days ==
A yet third category that may sometimes be called &quot;holidays&quot; in a sense are the &quot;flag days&quot; (Beflaggungstage). Only the very highest institutions and the military use the national flags at every day, so the directives when flags &quot;are&quot; to be displayed mark the days in question as special.

Flags are to be shown by Federal Decree on
* Holocaust Memorial Day (27 January, half-mast)
* Labour Day (1 May)
* Europe Day (9 May)
* Constitution Day (23 May)
* Popular Uprising Day (17 June) This day was public holiday under the title of &quot;German Unity Day&quot; from 1954 until 1990 when that unity actually was achieved.
* Resistance Day (20 July)
* German Unity Day (3 October)
* Memorial Day (half-mast) (two Sundays before the first Sunday of Advent)
* Election Day (Bundestag, European Parliament)
and by state decrees on other days, such as election days for state parliaments, state constitution days, anniversary of the election of the Federal President (in Berlin) and so forth.

Frequently flags are ordered &quot;ad hoc&quot; to be shown at half-mast in cases of national mourning.

== Unofficial holidays ==
Either Carnival Monday (&quot;Rosenmontag&quot;) or Shrove Tuesday is a de facto holiday in some towns and cities in Catholic western and southern Germany which have a strong Carnival tradition.

Also, Christmas Eve is developing into a semi-holiday: from mid-afternoon it is practically treated as a holiday, and while shops still open in the morning, for other businesses (apart from those that work even on holidays) this is becoming increasingly unusual; schools are closed in any case.

== Customs about holidays ==
Ascension Day (Christi Himmelfahrt) and Corpus Christi (Fronleichnam) are both always on Thursdays. By taking only one day&#x27;s leave, employees can have a four-day weekend.

The Three Kings Day, better known as Epiphany, is 6 January, the day after the 12 days of Christmas. In parts of Germany, it has its own local customs.

<doc id="165964" wikidata="Q236972" url="?curid=165964" title="Fuxi">
<text>Fuxi or Fu Hsi (伏羲) is a culture hero in Chinese mythology, credited along with his sister and wife Nüwa with creating humanity and the invention of music, hunting, fishing, domestication, and cooking, as well as the Cangjie system of writing Chinese characters around 2900 BC or 2000BC. Fuxi was counted as the first mythical emperor of China, &quot;a divine being with a serpent&#x27;s body&quot; who was miraculously born, a Taoist deity, and/or a member of the Three Sovereigns at the beginning of the Chinese dynastic period.

Some representations show him as a human with snake-like characteristics, &quot;a leaf-wreathed head growing out of a mountain&quot;, &quot;or as a man clothed with animal skins.&quot;

== Names ==
He is also known as Bao Xi (包牺) and Mi Xi (宓羲).

==Origin==
Pangu was said to be the creation god in Chinese mythology. He was a giant sleeping within an egg of chaos. As he awoke, he stood up and divided the sky and the earth. Pangu then died after standing up, and his body turned into rivers, mountains, plants, animals, and everything else in the world, among which is a powerful being known as Huaxu (華胥). Huaxu gave birth to a twin brother and sister, Fuxi and Nüwa. Fuxi and Nüwa are said to be creatures that have faces of human and bodies of snakes.

However, in some myths, Fuxi was held to be the creator, not Pangu, who worked alone and not with Nüwa.

Fuxi was known as the &quot;original god&quot;, and he was said to have been born in the lower-middle reaches of the Yellow River in a place called Chengji (成紀) (possibly modern Lantian, Shaanxi province, or Tianshui, Gansu province).

A possible historical interpretation of the myth is that Huaxu (Fuxi&#x27;s mother) was a leader during the matriarchal society (BC) as early Chinese developed language skill while Fuxi and Nüwa were leaders in the early patriarchal society (BC) while Chinese began the marriage rituals.

A divinity Taihao (, &quot;The Great Bright One&quot;) appears, vaguely, in sources before the Han dynasty, independent from Fuxi. Later, Fuxi is identified with Taihao, the latter being his courtesy or formal name.

According to legend, the goddess of the Luo River, Mifei, was the daughter of Fuxi. Additionally, some versions of the legend state that she is Fuxi&#x27;s consort. She drowned in the Luo River while crossing it and became the spirit of the Luo River.

==Creation legend==
According to the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot;, Fuxi and Nüwa were the original humans who lived on the mythological Kunlun Mountain (today&#x27;s Huashan). One day they set up two separated piles of fire, and the fire eventually became one. Under the fire, they decided to become husband and wife. Fuxi and Nüwa used clay to create offspring, and with the divine power they made the clay figures come alive. These clay figures were the earliest human beings. Fuxi and Nüwa were usually recognized by Chinese as two of the Three Sovereigns in the early patriarchal society in China (BC), based on the myth about Fuxi establishing marriage ritual in his tribe. The creation of human beings was a symbolic story of having a larger family structure that included the figure of a father.

==Social importance==
On one of the columns of the Fuxi Temple in Gansu Province, the following couplet describes Fuxi&#x27;s importance: &quot;Among the three primogenitors of Huaxia civilization, Fu Xi in Huaiyang Country ranks first.&quot; During the time of his predecessor Nüwa, society was matriarchal.

Fuxi taught his subjects to cook and various methods of hunting and fishing, including fishing with nets and hunting with weapons made of bone, wood, or bamboo. He instituted the basic family structure, as well as marriage, and offered the first open-air sacrifices to heaven. A stone tablet, dated AD 160, shows Fuxi with Nüwa.

Traditionally, Fuxi is considered the originator of the methods of divination that were passed down through the ages before the &quot;I Ching.&quot; In other versions of the story, he is credited to the writing of some of the &quot;I Ching&quot; itself. His divination powers are attributed to his reading of the &quot;He Map&quot; (or the Yellow River Map). According to this tradition, Fuxi had the arrangement of the trigrams of the &quot;I Ching&quot; revealed to him in the markings on the back of a mythical dragon horse (sometimes said to be a tortoise) that emerged from the Luo River. This arrangement precedes the compilation of the &quot;I Ching&quot; during the Zhou dynasty. This discovery is said to have been the origin of calligraphy. Fuxi is also credited with the invention of the Guqin musical instrument, though credit for this is also given to Shennong and Yellow Emperor.

The Figurists viewed Fuxi as Enoch, the Biblical patriarch. Alexander Catcott, a Hutchinsonian, identified Fuxi with the Biblical Noah (&quot;A Treatise on the Deluge&quot;).

Fuxi and Nüwa were also thought to be gods of silk.

==Death==

Fuxi is said to have lived for 197 years altogether and died at a place called Chen (modern Huaiyang, Henan), where a monument to him can still be found and visited as a tourist attraction.

<doc id="165966" wikidata="Q843065" url="?curid=165966" title="World Scout Jamboree">
<text>The World Scout Jamboree is a Scouting jamboree of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, typically attended by several tens of thousands of Scouts from around the world, aged 14 to 17. At the jamboree, many scouts swap badges.

The first World Scout Jamboree was organized by The Scout Association in London. With exceptions for the World War years and the Iranian Revolution, it has been organized approximately every four years, and in the more recent years has been organised by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), in different locations over the world. The 25th World Scout Jamboree was held in South Korea in 2023.

In lexicography, &quot;Jamboree&quot; is considered an that traces back to 1860–65 and refers to a joyful, noisy gathering. The term is believed to originate from the words jabber (rapid, indistinct talk) and shivaree (noisy celebration), with &quot;m&quot; from jam (crowd).

==History==
While World Scout Jamboree is the expression used by the World Organization of the Scout Movement, other organizations held events called &quot;jamborees&quot; for their members.

The Scouting program became an international success following its founding by Robert Baden-Powell in 1907. With its continuing growth, the founder of the movement saw a need for a gathering of representatives of Scouting from all around the world. The general aim was to foster a worldwide brotherhood, and to help the young Scouts in the movement learn about other peoples and nations by direct interaction with them.

The idea of organizing such periodical international gatherings was originally conveyed to Baden-Powell by the General Chief of the Scouts of Greece, Konstantinos (&quot;Kokos&quot;) Melas, during the 1918 international Scout meeting, in England. Captain Melas proposed the gatherings should repeat every four years, in the same way Olympic Games were held in Ancient Greece. The suggestion was accepted with enthusiasm by Baden-Powell, who named the gatherings &quot;Jamborees&quot;.

It was in 1920 that the first World Scout Jamboree was realized, held in the Olympia halls in Kensington, London. Symbolically, the Jamboree site bore the name of the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Olympia. 8,000 Scouts from 34 countries attended the event.
Thereafter, a Jamboree has been held every four years. There are two exceptions to this: no Jamboree was held between 1937 and 1947 because of the Second World War, and the 1979 Jamboree, which was to be held in Iran, was cancelled due to the political upheaval in the region at that time. The Jamboree has been held in different countries around the world. The first seven Jamborees were held in Europe. The eighth World Jamboree was held in North America where the tradition of moving the Jamboree among the continents began. As yet, Africa has not hosted a jamboree.

To replace the cancelled event of 1979, the World Scout Committee determined that an alternative celebration, the World Jamboree Year should take place. Several regional camps took place, such as the 12th Australian/4th Asia-Pacific Jamboree, held in Perth, Western Australia, along with countless Join-in-Jamboree activities — designed to allow Scouts from around the world to participate in an activity that thousands of other Scouts around the world were also participating in at the same time. This &quot;Join-in&quot; programme was reproduced again as part of the Scouting 2007 Centenary celebrations.

The greatest attendance of all Jamborees was in 2019, where over 45,000 members experienced a Jamboree in West Virginia, US. This number represented the permanent contingent who remained for the entire event. They were joined by hundreds of thousands of visiting Scouts who participated on a day basis.

The first Jamboree was more akin to an exhibition of Scouting, allowing visitors to see how things were done in other parts of the world. The Second Jamboree was conducted on a camp basis and each successive Jamboree has developed on this format where the programme is typically more activity oriented, with plenty of time for Scouts from different nations to interact and learn about each other in less formal ways than an exhibition would allow.

The 16th World Scout Jamboree went to the Southern Hemisphere for the first time, in Sydney, NSW, Australia.

The 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007 was held in Hylands Park, Essex, United Kingdom, and celebrated the Centenary of Scouting. Because of this, the honour of hosting the event was again bestowed upon the United Kingdom, as the birthplace of Scouting. Over 40,000 young people camped in August at Hylands Park in Chelmsford, Essex. Hundreds of thousands of day visitors attended events in the south-east of England as part of the Jamboree.

The 22nd World Scout Jamboree was at Rinkaby, Sweden from 27 July to 8 August 2011; the 23rd World Scout Jamboree was at Kirara-hama, Yamaguchi City, Japan from 28 July to 8 August 2015; the 24th World Scout Jamboree was at The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, United States, from 22 July to 2 August 2019.

The 25th World Scout Jamboree was at Saemangeum in South Korea from 2 to 12 August 2023. It was accompanied by great heat from the beginning, several contingents, including British and American, therefore left the camp. On August 7, the Korean government decided to end the jamboree in Saemangeum early and to evacuate the participants to Seoul, the heat wave was to be replaced by a tropical storm. The jamboree program continued in the capital city of Seoul, with participants staying at various locations throughout the city, including military bases and universities. The closing ceremony was held at the Seoul World Cup Stadium, which hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

The 26th World Scout Jamboree will be held in 2027 at Sobieszowo Island near Gdańsk in Poland.
The 27th World Scout Jamboree will be held in 2031 at Silkeborg, Denmark.

===Jamboree on the Air===

Jamboree on the Air, usually referred to as JOTA, is an international Scouting and Guiding activity held annually on the third full weekend in October. The event was first held in conjunction with the fiftieth anniversary of Scouting in 1957, and was devised by radio amateur operator Leslie R. Mitchell who used the callsign G3BHK. It is now considered the largest event organized by the WOSM annually.
Amateur radio operators from all over the world participate with over 500,000 Scouts and Guides to teach them about radio and to assist them to contact their fellow Scouts and Guides by means of amateur radio and since 2004, by the VOIP-based Echolink. Scouts and Guides are also encouraged to send paper or electronic confirmations known as &quot;QSL cards&quot;, or &quot;eQSLs&quot; when they are sent electronically. This provides the Scouts and Guides with a means of learning about fellow Scouts and Guides from around the world. It is an adjunct to the World Scout Jamboree.

The event is recognized as one of international participation by the various Scout and Guide organisations, and supports several awards which are a part of Scouting and Guiding programmes.

Jamboree on the Internet, known by its acronym JOTI, is an international Scouting activity held annually. Participants, through the use of designated Chats from all over the world, can contact their fellow Scouts by means of the Internet. Common communication methods include ScoutLink (IRC), e-mail, and VOIP. This provides the Scouts with a means of learning about fellow Scouts from around the world. JOTI operates alongside JOTA (Jamboree on the Air) and is an official event of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.

JOTI was pioneered in 1995 by Queanbeyan Rovers whilst one Rover, Norvan Vogt was on a student exchange in the Netherlands, with the home crew in Australia co-ordinated by Brett Sheffield. They connected Putten, Netherlands and Queanbeyan, Australia with dedicated IRC servers. In November 1996 the World Scout Committee, noting that Scouting already had a considerable presence on the Internet, and that there was already an informal and rapidly growing Jamboree on the Internet, decided that JOTI should become an official international Scouting event, and that it should be held on the same weekend as the Jamboree on the Air (JOTA).
2011 saw the first ever &#x27;JOTI Radio&#x27; station, a broadcast internet radio station based in the UK to provide entertainment for the JOTI weekend, which had live interviews from Scouts all over the world, the team that lead JOTI Radio are made up of the &#x27;Avon Scout Radio&#x27; team, which are a County Active Support Unit for Avon Scouts and provide broadcast radio services within the Scouting Movement worldwide. JOTI Radio is now part of the annual JOTA/JOTI weekend.

===Jamboree on the Trail===
Following on the idea of the &quot;Join-in&quot; events from the World Jamboree Year, Jamboree on the Trail (or JOTT), is a co-ordinated event where Scouts around the world simultaneously participate in local hikes. It takes place on an annual basis on the 2nd Saturday in May.

This type of event allows Scouts to take part in activities at the same time as other Scouts, promoting the idea of the Scouting brotherhood. Participants are awarded a JOTT badge as a recognition of having participated in this worldwide event.

==Smaller events==
There are up to ten smaller Jamboree (or Jamborette) events held each year around the world. This includes Regional Jamborees, which are held every three years in their areas of the world. Scouts from outside these regions are invited, but attendance is generally lower (for example, the EuroJam 2005 event hosted 10,000 Scouts, mostly from Europe).

National associations, and sub-national groups, also organise a number of events, such as the WINGS event and KIJ, which is organised by a County level body.

<text>Stanisław Kiecal (September 14, 1886 – October 15, 1910), better known in the boxing world as Stanley Ketchel, was an American professional boxer who became one of the greatest World Middleweight Champions in history. He was nicknamed &quot;The Michigan Assassin.&quot; He was murdered at a ranch in Conway, Missouri, at the age of 24.

== Biography ==

He was born in 1886 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Tomasz and Julia (née Olbinska) Kiecal, whose family immigrated from the village of Sulmierzyce in Piotrków Governorate, in modern-day central Poland.

He avoided school, instead falling in with a gang of street kids and often getting into fist fights. At twelve years old, he ran away from home, becoming a child hobo. As a teenager he lived in Butte, Montana, where he found employment first as a hotel bellhop and then as a bouncer. This profession obviously led to many scraps that established his reputation as the best fist fighter in town. Soon enough sixteen-year-old Stanley was performing in backroom boxing matches with older locals for twenty dollars a week. He began traveling throughout Montana, offering to take on any man brave enough to face him. Between 1903 and 1906, he lost just twice in thirty-nine contests and, in 1907, moved to California, where he knew most of boxing&#x27;s big names and big fights waited for him.

== Professional boxing career ==
Only a middleweight, Ketchel was also known for taking on heavyweights, who sometimes outweighed him by more than 30 pounds (14 kg). According to hearsay, before each of his fights, he would imagine that his opponent had insulted his mother, with whom he had a very close relationship; thus, his anger would motivate him to fight with fury.

He started boxing professionally in 1903, at 16, in Butte, Montana. In his first fight, Ketchel knocked out Kid Tracy in one round. In his second fight, he was beaten by decision in six rounds by Maurice Thompson. He boxed his first 41 bouts in Montana, and had a record of 36 wins, two losses, and three draws during that span. He lost once more to Thompson in their rematch and then controversially drew with him in their rubber match, in a bout that many people thought Ketchel had won. Afterwards, he went on to beat Tom Kingsley, among others, before moving his campaign on to California in 1907.

There, he won three fights that year, and drew one in Marysville against the man many considered the World Middleweight Champion, Joe Thomas. In his next bout, Thomas and he had a rematch and Ketchel won, by knockout in 32 rounds. Ketchel was then recognized by many as the World Middleweight Champion. He finished the year by beating Thomas again, this time by decision.

== Middleweight champion ==

On February 8, 1908, Ketchel met the man who was generally recognized as the World Welterweight Champion and one of the leading middleweights of the era, Mike &quot;Twin&quot; Sullivan, knocking him out in the first round and winning general recognition as World Middleweight Champion. Sullivan often fought above the welterweight limit, making him a light middleweight. Whether Ketchel became world champion when he defeated Thomas or Mike Sullivan has always been up to debate, but the fact remains that Mike Sullivan and not Thomas is historically remembered as a world champion.

He proceeded to retain the title against Mike&#x27;s twin brother, Jack &quot;Twin&quot; Sullivan, also a former world champion, by a knockout in 20 rounds; against future world champion Billy Papke by decision in 10; against Hugo Kelly by a knockout in three and against Thomas, by a knockout in two.

Then, he lost the belt to Papke by a knockout in 12, but Papke and he had an immediate rematch and Ketchel regained the title when he beat Papke by a knockout in 11 in their third match.

Ketchel began 1909 by fighting former Light Heavyweight Champion Philadelphia Jack O&#x27;Brien. Ketchel survived a terrible beating at the hand of the slick, quick O&#x27;Brien in the early rounds, only to mount a terrific comeback and score four knockdowns in the ninth and tenth rounds. When the final bell rang at the end of the 10th round, O&#x27;Brien was lying unconscious on the mat, his head in a resin box in his corner. Under New York rules at the time, though, O&#x27;Brien had been saved by the bell and because official decisions were outlawed in New York boxing, the fight was declared a &quot;no decision&quot;. A few weeks later, Ketchel had a rematch with O&#x27; Brien, knocking out Philadelphia Jack in three rounds.

A fourth fight with Billy Papke followed. Ketchel again won in a tumultuous slugfest to defend his championship and end their series of fights with a record of 3-1 in their four encounters. This (fourth) fight took place in the outdoor Mission Street Arena in Colma, California, during a terrible thunderstorm, yet neither fighter relented in his pursuit of victory until Stanley took the 20-round decision.

Ketchel fought Sam Langford on April 27, 1910. It was a hard-pressed fight by both men, each displaying terrific hitting power for all six rounds of the short bout. No knock downs were scored and both had plenty of energy in the end. Langford won by decision. A longer rematch bout was rumored, but never happened. Some disputed the decision, although a majority of people felt that Langford had won the bout, which following a decision-appealing vote, it was decided (in an uncontroversial manner) that it would stand as a decision win for Langford.

=== Ketchel vs. Johnson ===
Ketchel&#x27;s 1909 battle with Jack Johnson has been called by many a modern-day &quot;David and Goliath&quot;. In the 12th round, Ketchel floored Johnson with a right hand. Johnson got up and knocked out Ketchel with a right uppercut.

Ketchel and Johnson were rumored to have been friends and to have gone gambling, as well as hit the brothels, together; they shared a love for women. Ketchel and Johnson planned to fight together. Because Ketchel was shorter than Johnson, he wore long coats to conceal the platform shoes he had worn to make him look taller at a publicity event. They set up a script for their fight to stretch it to 20 rounds, as a 20-round fight would guarantee boxing fans would pay to go to local theaters to watch the replay of the fight. After 12 rounds, Ketchel swung a surprise punch that knocked Johnson down. Regaining his feet, Johnson then knocked out Ketchel with a swift combination to Ketchel&#x27;s head and jaw. Ketchel did not wake up for many minutes and some of his teeth were knocked out by the blow, with a few remaining embedded in Johnson&#x27;s glove.

== Murder ==

The following year, 1910, Ketchel fought six times (including one exhibition), but his fast living had worn him down. Hoping to regain his strength before a rematch with Jack Johnson, Ketchel moved to the ranch of his friend R. P. Dickerson, on what is now referred to as Dickerson Ranch Road, near Conway, Missouri. Dickerson had just hired a cook, Goldie Smith, and a ranch hand, who Smith said was her husband, Walter Kurtz. Walter Kurtz turned out to be Walter Dipley. Walter Dipley and Goldie Smith were not married, and in fact, had just met each other a month before Dickerson had hired them.

After being upbraided by Ketchel for beating a horse on the morning of October 14, Dipley decided to get even by robbing him. The following morning, Smith seated Ketchel at the breakfast table with his back to the door and Dipley, armed with a .22 caliber rifle, came up behind him and shouted, &quot;Get your hands up!&quot; Ketchel stood up, and as he turned around, Dipley shot him. The bullet traveled from his shoulder into his lung and Ketchel fell to the floor mortally wounded. Dipley then took Ketchel&#x27;s handgun and smashed Ketchel in the face with it. At the same time, Smith rifled Ketchel&#x27;s pockets for his money. After promising to meet Goldie Smith later that night, Dipley ran from the ranch.

As he lay dying, Ketchel told the former ranch foreman, C. E. Bailey, that Goldie Smith had robbed him, she told police officers that Ketchel had raped her and that that was the reason why Dipley had shot him. Her story fell apart and she admitted her complicity in the robbery, but stated she did not know Dipley was going to kill the reigning champion.

In an effort to save the young fighter&#x27;s life, R. P. Dickerson chartered a special train to take Stanley Ketchel to a hospital in Springfield, Missouri, but Ketchel died around 7 o&#x27;clock that night. His last words were: &quot;I&#x27;m so tired. Take me home to mother.&quot;

Dickerson also offered a $5,000 dead or alive reward (preferably dead) for Dipley, who was captured at a neighboring farmhouse the next day. Upon being informed of Ketchel&#x27;s death, his manager Wilson Mizner reportedly said, &quot;Tell them to start counting ten over him. He&#x27;ll get up.&quot;

=== Aftermath ===

Both Walter Dipley and Goldie Smith were convicted of murder and robbery at a jury trial in January 1911, and were given life sentences. Smith had her murder conviction overturned and she served 17 months for the robbery. Walter Dipley served 23 years before he was paroled. He died in 1956, 22 years after his release from prison.

== Legacy ==
Ketchel was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery at Grand Rapids, Michigan. His funeral was the best-attended burial ceremony in that state until the Ford family surpassed him during the 20th century. A plaque in his honor is at the corner of Stocking Avenue and 3rd Street, and a statue is at 438 Bridge Street Northwest. The Ketchel Valley neighborhood on Grand Rapids&#x27; west side is named in Ketchel&#x27;s honor.

Ketchel is now enshrined in the International Boxing Hall Of Fame.

&quot;The Ring&quot; in 2004 ranked Ketchel as the eighth-greatest middleweight of all time, behind Harry Greb, Sugar Ray Robinson, Carlos Monzon, Marvin Hagler, Jake LaMotta, Charley Burley, and Tiger Flowers. &quot;The Ring&quot; also named Ketchel number six on their list of 100 Best Punchers of All Time.

Nat Fleischer, the late ring historian and founding editor of &quot;The Ring&quot;, considered Stanley to be the greatest middleweight in history.

He had a record of 51 wins, four losses, four draws, one no contest, and four no decisions (newspaper decisions: 2-1-1), with 48 wins by knockout. He was the first middleweight champion to regain the world title after losing it.

<text>The Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument (GSENM) is a United States national monument protecting the Grand Staircase, the Kaiparowits Plateau, and the Canyons of the Escalante (Escalante River) in southern Utah. It was established in 1996 by President Bill Clinton under the authority of the Antiquities Act with 1.7 million acres of land, later expanded to . In 2017, the monument&#x27;s size was reduced by half in a succeeding presidential proclamation, and it was restored in 2021. The land is among the most remote in the country; it was the last to be mapped in the contiguous United States.

The monument is administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as part of the National Conservation Lands system. Grand Staircase–Escalante is the first and largest national monument managed by the BLM. Visitor centers are located in Cannonville, Big Water, Escalante, and Kanab.

==Geography==
The monument stretches from the towns of Big Water, Glendale, and Kanab, Utah in the southwest to the towns of Escalante and Boulder in the northeast. The monument is slightly larger in area than the state of Delaware. After a reduction ordered by presidential proclamation in December 2017, the monument encompassed , but it was restored to in 2021.
The western part of the monument is dominated by the Paunsaugunt Plateau and the Paria River, and is adjacent to Bryce Canyon National Park. This section shows the geologic progression of the Grand Staircase. Features include the slot canyons of Bull Valley Gorge, Willis Creek, and Lick Wash which are accessed from Skutumpah Road.

The center section is dominated by a single long ridge, called the Kaiparowits Plateau from the west, and Fifty-Mile Mountain when viewed from the east. Fifty-Mile Mountain stretches southeast from the town of Escalante to the Colorado River in Glen Canyon. The eastern face of the mountain is a escarpment. The western side (the Kaiparowits Plateau) is a shallow slope descending to the south and west.

East of Fifty-Mile Mountain is the Canyons of the Escalante. The monument is bounded by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area on the east and south. The popular hiking, backpacking, and canyoneering areas include Calf Creek Falls off Utah Scenic Byway 12, and Zebra Canyon, Harris Wash, and the Devils Garden. The latter areas are accessed via the Hole-in-the-Rock Road, which extends southeast from Escalante, near the base of Fifty-Mile Mountain. The Dry Fork Slots of Coyote Gulch and lower Coyote Gulch are also located off the Hole-in-the-Rock Road.

==Paleontology==

Since 2000, numerous dinosaur fossils over 75 million years old have been found at Grand Staircase–Escalante.

In 2002, a volunteer at the Monument discovered a 75-million-year-old dinosaur near the Arizona border. On October 3, 2007, the dinosaur&#x27;s name, &quot;Gryposaurus monumentensis&quot; (hook-beaked lizard from the monument) was announced in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. &quot;G. monumentensis&quot; was at least long and tall, and has a powerful jaw with more than 800 teeth. Many of the specimens from the Kaiparowits Formation are reposited at the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City.

Two ceratopsid (horned) dinosaurs, also discovered at the monument, were introduced by the Utah Geological Survey in 2007. They were uncovered in the Wahweap Formation, which is just below the Kaiparowits formation, where the duckbill was extracted. They lived about 80 million or 81 million years ago. The two fossils are called the Last Chance skull and the Nipple Butte skull. They were found in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Both were later identified as belonging to &quot;Diabloceratops&quot;.

In 2013 the discovery of a new species, &quot;Lythronax argestes&quot;, was announced. It is a tyrannosaur that is approximately 13 million years older than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, named for its great resemblance to its descendant. The specimen can be seen at the Natural History Museum of Utah.

==Human history==

Humans did not settle permanently in the area until the Basketmaker III Era, around AD 500. Both the Fremont and ancestral Puebloan people lived here; the Fremont hunted and gathered below the plateau and near the Escalante Valley, and the ancestral Puebloans farmed in the canyons. Both groups grew corn, beans, and squash, built brush-roofed pithouses, and took advantage of natural rock shelters. Ruins and rock art can be found throughout the Monument.

The first record of white settlers in the region dates from 1866 when Captain James Andrus led a group of cavalry to the headwaters of the Escalante River.

In 1871 Jacob Hamblin of Kanab, on his way to resupply the second John Wesley Powell expedition, mistook the Escalante River for the Dirty Devil River and became the first Anglo to travel the length of the canyon.

In 1879 the San Juan Expedition crossed through the region on their way to a proposed Mormon colony in the far southeastern corner of Utah. Traveling on a largely unexplored route, the group eventually arrived at the sandstone cliffs that surrounded Glen Canyon. They found the only breach for many miles in the otherwise vertical cliffs, which they named Hole-in-the-Rock. The narrow, steep, and rocky crevice eventually led to a steep sandy slope in the lower section and eventually down to the Colorado River. With winter settling in, the company decided to go down the crevice rather than retreat. After six weeks of labor, including excavation and using explosives to shift rock, they rigged a pulley system to lower their wagons and animals down the resulting road and off the cliff. There they built a ferry, crossed the river, and climbed back out through Cottonwood Canyon on the other side.

==National monument==

A national monument was initially proposed in 1934, but the project floundered until several decades later. It was on September 18, 1996, at the height of the 1996 presidential election campaign by President Bill Clinton, that the national monument was declared and was controversial from the moment of creation. The declaration ceremony was held at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, rather than in Utah.

Local officials such as Democratic U.S. Representative Bill Orton from Utah objected to the designation of the national monument, questioning whether the Antiquities Act allowed such vast amounts of land to be designated. However, United States Supreme Court decisions have long established the president&#x27;s discretion to protect land under the Antiquities Act, and several lawsuits filed in an effort to overturn the designation were dismissed by federal courts. The area&#x27;s designation as a monument also nixed the Andalex Coal Mine that was proposed for a remote location on the Kaiparowits Plateau.
Wilderness designation for the lands in the monument had long been sought by environmental groups; however, the designation of a monument is not the same as wilderness designation, as activities such as motorized vehicle and mountain bike use are allowed in National Monuments.

There are contentious issues peculiar to the state of Utah. Certain plots of land were assigned when Utah became a state (in 1896) as School and Institutional Trust Lands (SITLa, a Utah state agency), to be managed to produce funds for the state school system. These lands included scattered plots in the monument that could no longer be developed. The SITLa plots within the monument were exchanged for federal lands elsewhere in Utah, plus equivalent mineral rights and $50 million cash by an act of Congress, the Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act of 1998, supported by Democrats and Republicans, and signed into law as Public Law 105–335 on October 31, 1998.

A more difficult problem is the resolution of United States Revised statute 2477 (R.S. 2477) road claims. R.S. 2477 (Section 8 of the 1866 Mining Act) states: &quot;The right-of-way for the construction of highways over public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted.&quot; The statute was repealed by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976, but the repeal was subject to valid existing rights.

A process for resolving disputed claims has not been established, and in 1996, the 104th United States Congress passed a law that prohibited the R.S. 2477 (proposed resolution regulations) written by the Clinton Administration from taking effect without congressional approval.

The right to maintain and improve the many unpaved roads in the national monument is disputed, with county officials placing county road signs on the roads they claim and occasionally applying bulldozers to grade claimed roads, while the Bureau of Land Management tries to exert control over the same roads. Litigation between the state and federal government over R.S. 2477 and road maintenance in the national monument is an ongoing issue.

=== Reduction in size, restoration, and lawsuits ===
On December 4, 2017, President Donald Trump ordered that the monument&#x27;s size be reduced by nearly 47% to , with the remainder divided into three areas, two of which border one another along the Paria River. Bears Ears National Monument was significantly reduced in size at the same time. Conservation, angling, hunting, and outdoor recreation groups filed suit to block any reduction in the national monument, arguing that the president has no legal authority to materially shrink a national monument. The cases were still pending at the 2020 election. The Trump administration subsequently approved logging within the national monument and coal mining in the area that was removed from the monument.

On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling for a review of the reduction of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase–Escalante monuments. On October 8, 2021, he restored the original boundaries.

Two lawsuits, &quot;Garfield County v. Biden&quot;, filed by the state of Utah and two Utah counties, and &quot;Dalton v. Biden,&quot; filed by a mining company and recreationalists, seek to overturn the reaffirmed original boundaries and attack the Antiquities Act. The tribes filed motions to intervene.

On August 11, 2023, U.S. District Judge David Nuffer dismissed both cases, explaining that &quot;the Antiquities Act gives the president broad authority to designate national monuments and that courts cannot second-guess that authority.&quot; The state of Utah and other parties have since appealed the dismissal, but no such challenge has been successful in 100 years of the Antiquity Act&#x27;s history. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit heard the case in September 2024.

<text>Zilker Metropolitan Park is a recreational area in south Austin, Texas, at the juncture of Barton Creek and the Colorado River that comprises over of publicly owned land. It is named after its benefactor, Andrew Jackson Zilker, who donated the land to the city in 1917. The land was developed into a park during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Today the park serves as a hub for many recreational activities and the hike and bike trail around Lady Bird Lake, both of which run next to the park. The large size of the park makes it a capable venue for large-scale events such as the Austin City Limits Music Festival and the Zilker Park Kite Festival. The park was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

==History==
The land surrounding Barton Springs was claimed by its namesake, William Barton, in the 1830s for his cattle ranch. In the 1860s it was acquired by the Rabb family, who operated mills on Barton Creek. In the early twentieth century Andrew Jackson Zilker bought a plot of land between the Colorado River and Barton Creek, including the Springs, and used the spring water in his ice-making business. Zilker sold his land to the City of Austin in a series of sales in 1917, 1923 and 1931; he donated the proceeds of the sale to a trust dedicated to funding Austin&#x27;s public schools.

In the 1930s the city transformed the ranch into a space for public recreation, building park amenities and buildings with help from the Civil Works Administration. Barton Springs Pool was given a concrete dam and an enlarged swimming area. In 1934 the park was named Zilker Metropolitan Park, after its donor and patron.

==Attractions==
In addition to general-purpose lawns, sports fields, cross country courses, historical markers, concession stands and picnic areas, the park includes numerous public attractions. The Zilker Botanical Garden features several independently maintained gardens located near the center of the park and hosts the Zilker Gardens Festival every spring. The Austin Nature &amp; Science Center offers ecological exhibits, nature hike trails, and children&#x27;s educational programming. The Umlauf Sculpture Garden adjoins the southeast end of the park, displaying sculptural works by artist Charles Umlauf and others. The Zilker Hillside Theater hosts regular performances by local theatre companies, including free &quot;Shakespeare in the Park&quot; every May and an annual summer musical. Barton Springs Pool adjoins the park on the east, offering public swimming; other water activities are available in Barton Creek. The Beverly S. Sheffield Education Center by Barton Springs Pool offers exhibits about the natural history of the Edwards Aquifer that feeds Barton Springs. Every winter the Zilker Holiday Tree is illuminated, along with a Trail of Lights display. The Zilker Zephyr gauge miniature railway carries passengers on a tour around the park. It opened in 1961 and ran until 2019. In 2019, it closed down due to erosion. It has been reopened as of August 2023 as Zilker Eagle.

The park&#x27;s amenities and wide, open spaces allow it to host a variety of large events each year—notably, the &quot;Austin City Limits Music Festival&quot;, which fills the park for two weekends each fall with numerous live musical performances by prominent country, folk and rock artists, among others.

<text>Electronic body music (EBM) is a genre of electronic music that combines elements of industrial music and synth-punk with elements of dance music. It developed in the early 1980s in Western Europe, as an outgrowth of both the punk and the industrial music cultures. It combines sequenced repetitive basslines, programmed disco rhythms, and mostly undistorted vocals and command-like shouts with confrontational or provocative themes.

The evolution of the genre reflected &quot;a general shift towards more song-oriented structures in industrial as to a general turn towards the dancefloor by many musicians and genres in the era of post-punk.&quot; It was considered a part of the European new wave and post-punk movement and the first style that blended synthesized sounds with an ecstatic style of dancing (e.g. pogo).

EBM gained a stable following in the second half of the 1980s. Around that period, a youth-cultural scene emerged from EBM whose followers describe themselves as EBM-heads or (in North America) as rivetheads.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;electronic body music&quot; was first used by Ralf Hütter of the German electronic band Kraftwerk in an interview with British music newspaper Sounds in November 1977. In June 1978 Hütter reused the phrase in an interview with WKSU radio (Kent, Ohio) to explain the more physical character of the Kraftwerk album &quot;The Man-Machine&quot;. Although the term originated in the late 1970s, it was not until the 1980s when it reappeared and started to come into popular use.

In 1981, DAF from Germany employed the term &quot;Körpermusik&quot; (&quot;body music&quot;) to describe their danceable electronic punk sound. The term &quot;electronic body music&quot; was later used by Belgian band Front 242 in 1984 to describe the music of their EP of that year titled &quot;No Comment&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Described as an outgrowth of &quot;electronically generated punk [music] intertwined with industrial sounds,&quot; EBM has been characterized as a composite of programmed drum beats, repetitive basslines, and clear or slightly distorted vocals, instructional shouts or growls complemented with reverberation and echo effects. Typical EBM rhythms rely on the 4/4 disco beat or rock-oriented backbeats, (featuring kick drum, snare and hi-hat) and some minor syncopation.

Environmental samples, e.g. hammer blow, machine and alert sounds, are often used to create a &quot;factory ambiance&quot;. Other samples include political speeches and excerpts from science fiction movies, cf. &quot;Front 242 – Funkahdafi&quot;.

==History==
===Precursors===
EBM evolved from a combination of post-punk, industrial and post-industrial music sources, including The Normal, Suicide, DAF, Die Krupps, Killing Joke, Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle and Test Dept. but also krautrock and Berlin school artists such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream (who had used electronic bass sequences as a basic feature in their productions).

Other influences include the synth-pop music of The Human League and Fad Gadget; and the krautrock-inspired dance hit &quot;I Feel Love&quot; by Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer. Daniel Bressanutti (Front 242), who helped establish the term EBM, named the soundscapes of Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze as additional influences along Kraftwerk, Throbbing Gristle, the sequencer-based electro-disco of Giorgio Moroder, and the punk movement.

===1981–1987===
Emerging in the early 1980s in Germany and Belgium, bands such as DAF, Die Krupps, Liaisons Dangereuses, and Front 242 started to blend danceable rhythms and repetitive sequencer lines. At the time the genre arose, style-defining synthesizers included Korg MS-20, Roland SH-101, ARP Odyssey, Emulator II, along with several Oberheim and Yamaha models.

Archetypical songs are &quot;Verschwende deine Jugend&quot;, &quot;Alle gegen alle&quot; and &quot;Der Mussolini&quot; by DAF; &quot;Wahre Arbeit, wahrer Lohn&quot;, &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and &quot;Für einen Augenblick&quot; by Die Krupps; &quot;Etre assis ou danser&quot;, &quot;Los niños del parque&quot; and &quot;Avant-après mars&quot; by Liaisons Dangereuses, and &quot;Body to Body&quot;, &quot;U-Men&quot; and &quot;He Runs Too Fast for Us&quot; by Front 242.

Front 242 characterized their approach as somewhere between Throbbing Gristle and Kraftwerk. Nitzer Ebb and Portion Control, influenced by DAF and Cabaret Voltaire, followed soon after. Groups from this era often applied socialist realist aesthetics, with ironic intent. Other prominent artists were Pankow, Vomito Negro, Borghesia, The Neon Judgement, à;GRUMH..., A Split-Second, The Klinik, and Signal Aout 42.

===1988–1993===
In the second half of the 1980s, the genre became popular in Canada (Front Line Assembly) and the U.S. (Ministry, Revolting Cocks, Schnitt Acht) as well as in Sweden (Inside Treatment, Pouppée Fabrikk, Cat Rapes Dog) and Japan (2nd Communication, DRP, Soft Ballet). North American bands started to use EBM-typical bass sequences and combined them with the roughness of (hardcore) punk and thrash metal (cf. industrial metal). Nine Inch Nails continued the cross-pollination between EBM and rock music resulting in the album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; (1989).

Meanwhile, EBM became successful in the underground club scene, particularly in Europe. In this period the most important labels were the Belgian Play It Again Sam and Antler-Subway, the German Zoth Ommog, the North American Wax Trax! and the Swedish Energy Rekords. Notable acts at that time included And One, Armageddon Dildos, Bigod 20, Insekt, Scapa Flow, Orange Sector, Paranoid, and Electro Assassin.

Between the early and mid-1990s, many EBM artists ceased activities or changed their musical direction, incorporating more elements of rock, heavy metal and electronica. The album &quot;06:21:03:11 Up Evil&quot; by Front 242 initiated the end of the EBM era of the 1980s. Nitzer Ebb, one of the most important purveyors of the genre, turned into an alternative rock band. Without the strength of its figureheads, electronic body music as a discernable music style faded by the mid-1990s.

===Revival===

In the late 1990s and after the millennium, Belgian, Swedish and German artists such as Ionic Vision, Tyske Ludder, and Spetsnaz had reactivated the style. Based on this revival, Sweden and East Germany then became the centre of the movement spawning a variety of newcomers. Primarily as a counteracting force against the expanding futurepop scene, these artists followed a neo-traditionalistic path, often referred to as &quot;old school EBM&quot;.

Simultaneously, a number of European techno producers started incorporating elements of EBM into their sound. This tendency grew in parallel with the emerging electroclash scene and, as that scene started to decline, artists partly associated with it, such as The Hacker, DJ Hell, Green Velvet, Black Strobe, and David Carretta, moved towards this techno/EBM crossover style.

There has been increasing convergence between this scene and the old school EBM scene. Some artists have remixed each other. Most notably, Terence Fixmer joined with Nitzer Ebb&#x27;s Douglas McCarthy to form Fixmer/McCarthy.

==Aesthetics==

EBM follows the transgressive approach of punk and industrial music (e.g. &quot;demystification of symbols&quot;) and the use of provocative extreme imagery is common (e.g. Nazi paraphernalia; reminiscent of punk&#x27;s use of the swastika). Appropriating totalitarian, Socialist and Fascist references, symbols, and signifiers has been a recurring topic of debate between fans and outsiders to the genre alike due to its stylistical ambiguity that stems from industrial music&#x27;s contrarian nature. In one instance, military-themed band Laibach &quot;ma[de] no attempt to subvert this image [so] it has the aura of authenticity&quot; so &quot;[m]any Laibach fans began to revel in the evils of the band and to take their stage act at face value.&quot;

The military style of EBM has a &quot;part-human part-machine&quot; gestalt typical of transhumanist or cyberpunk movements. EBM asserts a hyper-masculine image of &quot;triumphalism, combat postures, and paranoia,&quot; and is known for its &quot;tough-guy&quot; or machismo attitudes displayed by both men and women. According to Gabi Delgado-López of Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, the duo who adopted an aesthetic of black leather and military paraphernalia in the early 1980s was inspired by the male homosexual sado-masochistic scene and is not meant to represent &quot;&quot;machismo&quot; ideology&quot; but part of a &quot;role.&quot;

== Derivatives and alternative terms ==
===Electro-industrial===

Electro-industrial is an outgrowth of the EBM and industrial music that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has minimal structures and a clean production, electro-industrial draws on deep, complex and layered sounds, incorporating elements of ambient industrial. Electro-industrial was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Numb and Mentallo &amp; The Fixer. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the dark electro genre and, in the end of the decade, a strongly techno- and hard-trance-inspired style called &quot;hellektro&quot; or &quot;aggrotech.&quot;

===Industrial dance===
Industrial dance is a North American umbrella term for electronic body music and electro-industrial music. Fans associated with these genres call themselves &quot;rivetheads&quot;.

In general, industrial dance is characterized by its &quot;electronic beats, symphonic keyboard lines, pile-driver rhythms, angst-ridden or sampled vocals, and cyberpunk imagery&quot;.

Since the mid-1980s, the term &quot;industrial dance&quot; has been used to describe the music of Cabaret Voltaire (early 1980s), early Die Krupps, Portion Control, The Neon Judgement, Clock DVA, Nitzer Ebb, KMFDM, Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, Front 242, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, Manufacture, Yeht Mae, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Leæther Strip or early Spahn Ranch. In March 1989, &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; presented a two-paged special report about the industrial dance movement in Canada and the U.S.

<text>Ralph Christian Möbius (9 January 1950 – 20 August 1996), known professionally as Rio Reiser, was a German musician and from 1970 to 1985 the lead singer and main lyric-writer for the rock group Ton Steine Scherben. After that band broke up, he worked as a solo artist. Among his best known songs are &quot;Macht kaputt, was euch kaputt macht&quot;, &quot;Keine Macht für Niemand&quot;, and the &quot;Rauch-Haus-Song&quot; with the Ton Steine Scherben. As a solo artist, his best known songs are &quot;König von Deutschland&quot;, &quot;Alles Lüge&quot;, and &quot;Junimond&quot;. Reiser supported squatting in the early 1970s and later the green political party Die Grünen. After the German reunification, he joined the Party of Democratic Socialism.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Reiser&#x27;s father was an engineer for Siemens, and the family moved several times because of his father&#x27;s work; they lived in West Berlin, Upper Bavaria, Nuremberg, Mannheim, and Fellbach. Reiser was never really able to feel at home in any of these places. Many of his friends said, when they were asked in an interview broadcast on the TV channel Arte in 1998, two years after his death, that he started playing music to create a place where he felt at home.

Reiser was known by his friends as someone who had a special mind of his own. For example, he managed to persuade his mother Erika Möbius that he was allowed to stop attending school and start an apprenticeship in a studio for photography, which he then quit in order to join a music conservatory and later to follow his two older brothers to West Berlin at the early age of 17 in order to put the world&#x27;s first &quot;Rock Opera&quot; onto stage. His mother supported his musical and artistic ambitions since she had soon realized that he was an autodidact; he never learned things when he was taught by someone else. Thus he taught himself how to play cello, guitar, piano and other instruments, wrote lyrics and poetry and later also assumed jobs as actor in some movies and TV shows or at the theatre.

He was given his nickname &quot;Rio&quot; as teenager by an eccentric artist and friend of the family who invented the name &quot;Rio de Galaxis&quot; for him in an &quot;intergalactic youth ordination&quot;. He kept the nickname and later decided to change his name from Ralph Möbius to Rio Reiser when he played a leading role in the movie &#x27; and needed a catchy artist name. He took the idea for the name Reiser from his older brother Gert who had occasionally used it as artist name before. The name makes reference to the main character of the 1785-86 autobiographical novel &#x27; by Karl Philipp Moritz.

During his teenage years, Rio Reiser first discovered—and immediately became a big fan of—The Beatles at age 13 who represented the sound—and way of life—of the future for him and also inspired him to learn to play guitar, to compose his own songs and to form his first band. Later he preferred the rough, direct sound of The Rolling Stones. In reference to John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were usually credited as &quot;Lennon/McCartney&quot; with respect of the songs they wrote, Rio and his band colleague and best friend R.P.S. Lanrue (real name Ralph Peter Steitz) as composers of most of the Ton Steine Scherben-songs were often credited as &quot;Möbius/Steitz&quot;. Besides contemporary rock bands which became the soundtrack of the social changes beginning in the Sixties, Rio Reiser was also influenced by other music styles including orchestral film soundtracks, German &quot;folk songs&quot; and traditional music and German singers such as Marlene Dietrich. The avant-garde director Rosa von Praunheim repeatedly gave Reiser artistic suggestions.

Reiser was unique among German rock stars of his time in being openly gay. He came out in 1970 and lived openly as gay in his private life. At the beginning of his career, Reiser sometimes felt like a misfit among the political groups and various movements which, in the early Seventies, did not strongly approve of homosexuality. He later gained confidence while working with artists who were engaged in the newly forming gay movement of Berlin, including the gay performance group &quot;Brühwarm&quot; which recorded two LPs with music composed by Ton Steine Scherben. Reiser did not come out publicly until the 1980s. In 1986 he began to discuss being gay in interviews and talk-shows.

As an adult, Rio soon discovered his musical talents, which opened a way for him to express himself, thus enabling him to overcome restraints he otherwise felt due to a certain, intrinsic insecurity or shyness towards other people. The ability to reach out to others—even to the unknown masses in a concert audience—through his musical performance was later often referred to as being the core of his special talent to touch his listeners, or even to &quot;build a relationship&quot; with each of them for the period of a concert.

=== Musical career ===

While he still went to school, Reiser became singer in his first rock band The Beat Kings. The band had been founded by R.P.S. Lanrue (real name Ralph Peter Steitz), a boy living in the neighbourhood, who had heard of Reiser&#x27;s singing talents and had asked him to join the band after letting Reiser perform a few songs to give a sample (as R.P.S. Lanrue later claimed in an interview, the Rolling Stones song &quot;Play with fire&quot; tipped the balance). Lanrue, who was of the same age as Reiser, soon became Reiser&#x27;s closest friend and musical counterpart; he went on to support Reiser as a musician and lived with him most of the time until his death.

After leaving school, Reiser left his then hometown, as well as The Beat Kings, to follow his two older brothers&#x27; call to Berlin in order to compose the music for their common project, the first Beat-Opera, which turned out to be, in the words of Rio, an &quot;absolute flop&quot;. Nevertheless, Reiser stayed in Berlin, where he was later joined by Lanrue.

After occasionally having toured the countryside with the theatre group &quot;Hoffmans Comic Theater&quot; (consisting in Reiser, his brothers and a group of friends), Reiser went on to continue theatrical projects in Berlin where he joined an improvisation theatre group which played scenes from the everyday life of pupils and trainees, thus adopting and reflecting the social problems among young people in West Berlin in the Sixties, as well as its tense and sense of imminent social change. The theatre was very successful with young people and toured through Germany until 1969. The involvement in the context of the student and youth movement—not only as musician and actor, but often in the political debates which were to follow the theatre performance as well, played an important role for Rio Reiser&#x27;s development of political awareness and for his lifelong commitment—both privately and as musician—to liberation movements of various kinds, including, in particular, the left-wing political movement characteristic for the Sixties and Seventies (while he liked to put an emphasis on supporting the workers&#x27; and &quot;simple people&#x27;s&quot; interests rather than the students&#x27; intellectual approach), the Gay liberation movement and later, the German ecological movement. His musical work to a large extent reflects these political influences and convictions and thus can hardly be detached from his political positions.

=== Ton Steine Scherben ===

In 1970, Reiser recorded his first single with the band Ton Steine Scherben. The band name was chosen in a lengthy democratic decision procedure among the members, friends and supporters of the band. The original name idea was actually &quot;VEB Ton Steine Scherben&quot;, but the &quot;VEB&quot; was soon dropped. The band name can be translated both as &quot;clay stones shards&quot; and as &quot;sound stones shards&quot;, thus offering different approaches to interpretation (sometimes also understood as a political program) and, last not least, making reference to Reiser&#x27;s favorites The Rolling Stones. In that same year the group performed their first public concert and recorded their first full-length record.

The band soon became very popular with the squatter scene, left-wing student and workers&#x27; movement and was invited to numerous political events to provide the soundtrack to demonstrations, parties and rallies across Germany which often inspired the audience to translate the message into action afterwards. Thus, many buildings were seized after the end of a concert, and the band often ended up sitting in some commune discussing the political agenda with their hosts. Reiser later revealed in his autobiography that he sometimes would have preferred to just get away with some nice person.
15 years of touring, four more LPs and various film projects and collaborations with other musicians followed, including the recording of two children&#x27;s records. Reiser lived together with the band and a large group of friends and supporters most of that time, first sharing a commune in Berlin. In 1975—after the band was tiring of the numerous demands and expectations by all kinds of political groups—the group settled down on a farm in Fresenhagen, in North Germany which continued to be Reiser&#x27;s refuge and place of inspiration even after moving back to Berlin a couple of years later. One of the band&#x27;s most important and ambitious albums, the &quot;Black Album&quot;, was recorded there.

&quot;Ton Steine Scherben&quot; were musically very successful and, being one of the first rock bands in Germany which actually wrote and performed German rock songs, opened the door for countless successful German rock and pop bands to follow. Due to their refusal to adapt to the demands of the mainstream music business, as well as to financial mismanagement, a certain &quot;outlawish&quot; image in the eyes of the large radio and TV stations and a fan community which often forgot that the band had to make a living out of the music and would have despised any commercial ambitions, they were not able to translate their musical success and widespread popularity into financial stability.

=== Solo career ===
In 1985, Reiser and the band finally split, partly due to a feeling that it was time to move on, but to a large extent because of a disastrous financial situation. Reiser had a large debt with the group, but his early solo career went so well that he was free from debt in a short time. His first solo record-album was called &quot;Rio I&quot; and included the popular song König von Deutschland (&quot;King of Germany&quot;). The album was produced by Annette Humpe, a renowned German music producer who had already produced Reiser&#x27;s very first solo single, &quot;Dr. Sommer&quot;, some time ago when he was in need of cash and had asked her for support. The song &quot;König von Deutschland&quot; became one of the few real hits of Reiser, has been covered and cited by many artists ever since and is still known among most people in Germany. Other hit singles of the first album included the love song &quot;Für immer und dich&quot; and the melancholic &quot;Junimond&quot;. Reiser could not repeat the commercial success of the first album, nevertheless he released five further studio albums until his death, most of them highly praised by the critics.

Many of his fans from the &quot;Ton Steine Scherben&quot;-days thought that he was selling out to mainstream, capitalist music business, and blamed him for becoming—at least for a period of time—a commercially successful musician. However, when listening closely to the lyrics, it can be noted that Reiser never abandoned his personal approach to music, politics, life and love, although the message was delivered in a more subtle way now. Reiser sometimes admitted that the objections to his solo music, even hatred by some old-time fans was a serious problem for him. Wandering on the edge of commercial adaptability, while trying to conform with the expectations of old friends, fans and political movements which he supported meant a difficult struggle for Reiser which sometimes drove him to despair and depression. At the same time, he continued to be a very creative, productive musician and songwriter who collaborated with other musicians and friends and underwent strenuous concert tours which often brought him close to physical exhaustion. One of the highlights of his career were two concerts performed in East Berlin in 1988 where he faced a sold-out concert hall filled with young people on the verge of the revolution which one year later led to the collapse of the political system of the German Democratic Republic and the opening of the Berlin wall. Recordings of the concerts prove that the east German audience knew the lyrics of his solo songs, and in particular all of the &quot;Ton Steine Scherben&quot; songs which they performed by heart, even though the albums were hard to come by in East Germany.

Reiser wrote and performed most of his songs entirely by himself, although he was often accompanied by his longtime friend R.P.S. Lanrue who continued to support him as lead guitar player and also delivered many musical ideas, while a few of his song lyrics were also written by or together with his long-term partner Misha Schoeneberg. Reiser&#x27;s sixth and last solo album, which was recorded in 1995, was called &quot;Himmel und Hölle&quot; (&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;). The album was the last one which he was contractually obliged to deliver to his major music company, and both the musical approach as well as the lyrics imply that Reiser was about to return to a state of inner independence from the major business not only personally, but also in artistic terms, including a sound and concept which is often seen as more authentic than the previous studio albums. After the release of the last album, which was not strongly marketed by his company, even though praised by the critics, Reiser was preparing new songs which he would have produced independently again, the completion of which was interrupted by his sudden and unexpected death.

Some critics say that Rio Reiser created a new image of a German folk singer; he was even called a &quot;Schlager&quot; artist and a &quot;Volksmusik&quot; musician (sometimes translated as &quot;folk music&quot;, but in a literary sense it means music of the people). To other critics, Reiser was simply a singer in a rock band. However, Reiser sometimes approved of being referred to a Volksmusik musician, because he thought that this would simply mean he sang music for the people.

=== Death ===

Reiser died on 20 August 1996 from a circulatory collapse after internal bleeding at his home in Fresenhagen, where he was buried on his own property under an apple tree.

His grave was moved to Berlin in March 2011, because Reiser&#x27;s heirs sold the Fresenhagen property.

<text>Rumble in the Bronx () is a 1995 action comedy film directed by Stanley Tong, and starring Jackie Chan, Anita Mui, and Françoise Yip. The film is set in the Bronx area of New York City, but was filmed in and around Vancouver, Canada.

An international co-production between Hong Kong and the United States, the film was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 21 January 1995. &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; had a successful worldwide theatrical run, and brought Chan into the North American mainstream.

==Plot==
Ma Hon Keung, a Hong Kong cop comes to New York to attend the wedding of his Uncle Bill, who introduces him to his African-American bride-to-be Whitney at his supermarket, which he has sold to Elaine. Uncle Bill&#x27;s friend Steven Lo loans him a vintage automobile for the wedding. That night, a street gang starts a motorcycle race near Uncle Bill&#x27;s apartment. They are about to run over his friend&#x27;s car until Keung jumps down and stops them. He soon starts a rivalry with the gang after driving them away from Elaine&#x27;s supermarket, which they tried to rob and vandalize. A series of brawls breaks out in which the bikers try to corner Keung and finish him off. After one attack in which the gang members pelt glass bottles at him, Keung returns home badly injured. His neighbor Nancy, a lingerie dancer/associate of the bikers and her younger brother Danny, a Chinese-American paraplegic who&#x27;s taken a liking to Keung, take care of him and clean his wounds.

When a gang member named Angelo gets involved in an illegal diamond deal gone bad and steals the diamonds, the small-time gangsters become the victims of a larger and more effective crime syndicate led by a man named White Tiger. While running away with the diamonds, Angelo hides them in a cushion which is unknowingly used by Keung for Danny&#x27;s wheelchair. Keung befriends Nancy and while visiting her at the seedy club she works at, advises her to stay away from crime. When the gangsters see this, they chase Keung and Nancy (after the gangsters made Keung believe that they are FBI agents and they made Keung believe that White Tiger is a victim of a robbery too). After failing to confront Keung, the bikers trash Elaine&#x27;s supermarket, during which two of Angelo&#x27;s men are captured by White Tiger&#x27;s men, who turn up at the supermarket in search of Angelo. Angelo&#x27;s colleagues are unaware of his diamond heist and one is executed in a tree-shredder; his remains given back to the other gangsters as a warning to return the multimillion-dollar goods. Keung and Nancy go to the bikers&#x27; headquarters after the latest supermarket attack, and Keung defeats them in another brawl. One of Angelo&#x27;s men reported his gang for one member are murdering by gangsters for the reason to steals diamonds.

After Angelo identified the gangsters are the falses FBI agents, Keung agrees to help the biker leader Tony who is Nancy&#x27;s boyfriend, where he convinces the street gangsters to reform and brings the big-time criminals to justice. The syndicate and Keung discover the diamonds in Danny&#x27;s wheelchair. The handover is botched after Nancy and Tony are held hostage by the syndicate and the diamonds are lost after they use a tow truck to destroy Elaine&#x27;s supermarket. White Tiger&#x27;s men hijack a hovercraft and are pursued by Keung and the New York Police Department in the Hudson River. The hovercraft ends up running through the streets, causing much damage to property. Keung ends the chase by stealing a six-foot, jagged-sword from a museum, clamping it onto the window of a Lamborghini Countach and driving into the hovercraft, shredding the rubber skirt and crashing the vehicle. After shooting one of the syndicate men non-fatally to force them to reveal White Tiger&#x27;s location, Keung drives the repaired hovercraft to a golf course where White Tiger is playing with subordinates. Keung runs them over, leaving White Tiger naked on the ground.

==Production==
In his autobiography, &quot;I am Jackie Chan: My life in Action&quot;, Jackie Chan talked about the initial difficulty of filming a movie in Vancouver that is set in New York. The production team initially had to put up fake graffiti during the day and take it all down during the evening, while simultaneously making sure that no mountains made it into the background. However, Chan decided that it was best that the production team focus on the action only without worrying too much about scenery. In his review, Roger Ebert notes that there are mountains in the background, which are not present in the NYC landscape. There is also an NYC helicopter which displays a Canadian civil registration (C-GZPM - A Bell JetRanger).

The original spoken dialogue consisted of all of the actors speaking their native language most of the time. In the completely undubbed soundtrack, available on the Warner Japanese R2 DVD release, Jackie Chan actually speaks his native Cantonese while Françoise Yip and Morgan Lam (the actors playing Nancy and Danny) speak English. All of the original dialogue was intended to be dubbed over in the international and Hong Kong film markets, and New Line Cinema overdubbed and slightly changed the original English dialogue.

During filming, Chan broke his right ankle while performing a stunt. He spent much of the remaining shooting time with one foot in a cast. When it came to the film&#x27;s climax, the crew colored a sock to resemble the shoe on his good foot, which Chan wore over his cast. His foot still had not completely healed when he went on to shoot his next film, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; (filmed the same year, 1994, but released earlier in the U.S.).

The film had a production budget of .

==Release==
The film was the first Chinese film to be simultaneously released in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

New Line Cinema acquired the film for international distribution and commissioned a new music score and English dub (with participation from Jackie Chan). A scene of Keung&#x27;s airplane flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport was added to the opening credits. Three scenes were added exclusively for the international version: a shot of the syndicate&#x27;s car pulling up to the diamond deal, Keung and Nancy escaping from the nightclub after the bikers spot them together, and White Tiger taking a golf shot before a subordinate approaches him with his phone. None of these scenes were in the original Hong Kong release. In comparison to the Hong Kong version, 17 minutes of cuts were made, and the new English dub changed some of the context of the characters&#x27; conversations. Keung being a cop and having a girlfriend in Hong Kong is never mentioned. Keung&#x27;s father being shot by a robber years ago is also not mentioned. In the New Line Cinema edit, Elaine buys the grocery store upon her first meeting with Uncle Bill, but in the Hong Kong version, she decides to buy the market at Bill&#x27;s wedding.

The new soundtrack replaced Chan&#x27;s song over the closing credits with the song &quot;Kung Fu&quot; by the band Ash, the lyrics of which mention Jackie Chan, as well as other Asian figures and characters ubiquitous in the west.

==Reception==

The film was Chan&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough in North America. When the film made its North American premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1996, the film drew overwhelmingly positive reactions from large crowds cheering loudly, comparable to a sold-out concert. It eventually got a wide release in February 1996. Opening on 1,736 North American screens, it was number one at the box office in its opening weekend, grossing US$9,858,380 ($5,678 per screen). It became one of the year&#x27;s top 20 highest-grossing R-rated films, finishing its North American run with $32,392,047 (equivalent to adjusted for inflation in 2021). In the United Kingdom, the film sold 130,583 tickets and grossed . In France and Germany, the film sold 493,756 tickets. In other European countries, the film sold 460,254 tickets.

===Critical response===
When released in North America, &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; received generally positive reviews, with most critics happy that a Jackie Chan film was finally getting a wide theatrical release in North America. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating based on reviews from critics, with an average rating of . Most critics praised the action, stunts, and Chan&#x27;s charm, but found the plot and acting to be lacking.

Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, rating it 3 out of 4 stars. His review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated:
Any attempt to defend this movie on rational grounds is futile. Don&#x27;t tell me about the plot and the dialogue. Don&#x27;t dwell on the acting. The whole point is Jackie Chan – and, like Astaire and Rogers, he does what he does better than anybody. There is a physical confidence, a grace, an elegance to the way he moves. There is humor to the choreography of the fights (which are never too gruesome). He&#x27;s having fun. If we allow ourselves to get in the right frame of mind, so are we.

Nate Jones in &quot;The Daily Utah Chronicle&quot; rated the film stars. He described Chan as &quot;the biggest action hero in the world&quot; like a cross between Bruce Lee, Bruce Willis, Charlie Chaplin, and Harrison Ford, and said Chan &quot;has brought the Kung-Fu action picture&quot; genre &quot;roaring back to life&quot; in American pop culture. He praised the action choreography as &quot;a masterfully seamless wave, proving that acting and fighting can coexist, if they&#x27;re in the hands of a virtuoso.&quot; However, he criticized the English dubbing.

In a 1995 review for the Hong Kong Film Critics Society, Stephen Teo panned the film as &quot;at best, an average Jackie Chan picture.&quot; He noted that despite the final hovercraft set piece, the action &quot;is offset by the comedy underpinnings of the thin plot.&quot;

The film was featured in a 2015 video essay by Every Frame A Painting, calling attention to the fact that the movie was shot in Vancouver despite being set in the Bronx, where no mountain ranges are visible.

<text>Skiing, or traveling over snow on skis, has a history of at least eight millennia. The earliest archaeological examples of skis were found in Karelia (a region in western Russia on the border with Finland) and date to 6000 BCE. Although skiing&#x27;s origins were purely utilitarian, the modern sport evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia. In the mid-1800s skiing became a popular recreational activity and sport. In the 20th century it was practiced in snow-covered regions worldwide, providing a market for the development of ski resorts and their related communities.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;ski&quot; comes from the Old Norse word which means &quot;cleft wood&quot;, &quot;stick of wood&quot; or &quot;ski&quot;. In Old Norse common phrases describing skiing were &quot;fara á skíðum&quot; (to travel, move fast on skis), &quot;renna&quot; (to move swiftly) and &quot;skríða á skíðum&quot; (to stride on skis). Modern Norwegian and Swedish, however, do not form a verb from the noun. Other languages make a verb form out of the noun, such as &quot;to ski&quot; in English, in French, in Spanish and Portuguese, in Italian, in Dutch, or (as above also or ) in German.
Finnish has its own ancient words for skis and skiing: &quot;ski&quot; is and &quot;skiing&quot; is . The Estonian &quot;suusk&quot; and &quot;suusatama&quot; are of the same Finno-Ugric origin.
The Sami also have their own words for &quot;skis&quot; and &quot;skiing&quot;: for example, the Lule Sami word for &quot;ski&quot; is and skis are called . The Sami use for the verb &quot;to ski&quot;.

==Early archaeological evidence==

The oldest information about skiing is based on archaeological evidence. Two regions present the earliest evidence of skis and their use: northern Russia, where the oldest fragments of ski-like objects, dating from about 6300–5000 BCE were found about 1,200 km northeast of Moscow at Lake Sindor, and the Altaic region of modern China where 5000-year-old paintings suggest the aboriginal use of skis, though this is still highly debated. 

===Rock carvings===
The earliest Scandinavian examples of skiing date to 3000 or 4000 BCE with primitive carvings. An image of a skier holding a single pole or an ax with both hands, is found in Norway. The Rødøy carving shows skis of equal length. A rock carving at Norway, from about 1000 or 500 BCE depicts a skier seemingly about to shoot with bow and arrow, with skis positioned in an angle (rather than parallel) to offer good support. Rock drawings in Norway dated at 4000 BCE depict a man on skis holding a stick. Near the White Sea in Russia, rock carvings were discovered in 1926 and dated to 2000 or 2500 BCE. One of the White Sea carvings depicts hunting of big game with hunters on equal length skis. The hunters apparently used their bow and spear as poles.

5000-year-old wall paintings suggest skiing had also evolved separately in the Xinjiang region by the Tuvan people; however, this continues to be debated.

===Ski samples===
The first primitive Scandinavian ski was found in a peat bog in Hoting in Jämtland County in Sweden; it dates back to 4500 or 2500 BCE. In 1938 a ski was found from Salla, Finland that has been dated back to 3245 BCE. Noted examples are the Kalvträskskidan ski, found in Sweden and dated to 3300 BCE, and the Vefsn Nordland ski, found in Norway and dated to 3200 BCE. There are some 20 findings of ancient well-preserved skis found in drained bogs in Norway, indicating that skis have been widely used in Norway, particularly Northern Norway, since prehistoric times. Skis have also been uncovered in ancient graves. In 2014, a ski complete with leather bindings emerged from a glacier in the Reinheimen mountains, Norway. The binding is at a small elevated area in the middle of the 172 cm long and 14,5 cm wide ski. According to the report the ski is some 1300 years old. Many organic artifacts have been well preserved for several thousand years by the stable glaciers of Oppland county and emerge when glaciers recede. A ski excavated in Greenland is dated to 1010. Based on findings in the Nordic countries and elsewhere, researchers have identified at least three main types of ski: arctic, southern and central Nordic. The arctic type was short and covered with fur, and used from northern Japan in the east to Ob river in the west. The Sami people probably brought this type to the Nordic region. The southern type had one short and one long ski, and was used in forest areas of Southern Scandinavia and the Baltic countries. The central Nordic type also had one short with fur (the &quot;andor&quot;) and one long, and was used in large parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland.

In 2021, a well-preserved ski at length and up to wide was found near a shrinking glacier at an elevation of 1000 meters in Reinheimen (at a mountain plateau between Lesjaskogsvatnet and Skjåk), Norway. It is estimated to be 1300 years old (that is, from around the year 700). A ski found in 2014 at the same location (some five meters from last find) is believed to belong to the same pair so that the two skis constitute the world&#x27;s oldest complete set. The skis are made of birch and have leather bindings.

===Writings===

The earliest known texts that mention skiing were written by a Western Han Dynasty era Chinese scholar estimated between 206 BCE and 225 BCE, and referred to people who had skied in the Altai Mountains. Another ancient text referring to skiing was made by the Byzantine scholar Procopius in the sixth century CE, who wrote of a people who skied that he called the “scrithiphinnoi,” or “sliding Sami&quot;.

==Travel and transportation==

Norse mythology describes the god Ullr and the goddess Skaði hunting on skis, Ullr and Skaði has later been regarded as the god and goddess of skiing and hunting. Early historical evidence includes Procopius&#x27; (around CE 550) description of Sami people as &quot;skrithiphinoi&quot; (or &quot;skridfinns&quot;) translated as &quot;ski running samis&quot; (Sami people were commonly referred to as &quot;Finn&quot;). Birkely argues that the Sami people have practiced skiing for more than 6000 years, evidenced by the very old Sami word &quot;čuoigat&quot; for skiing. Paulus Diaconus mentioned what may have been Sami and described how they chased animals by a twisted piece of wood that they painstakingly shaped to resemble a bow. Egil Skallagrimsson&#x27;s 950 CE saga describes King Haakon the Good&#x27;s practice of sending his tax collectors out on skis. The Gulating law (1274) stated that &quot;No moose shall be disturbed by skiers on private land.&quot;

The saga of King Sverre of Norway reports how Sverre, around the year 1200, sent troops on ski to patrol the Aker area near Oslo. During Sverre&#x27;s siege of Tønsberg Fortress, soldiers boldly skied down the steep cliff. According to the saga, Haakon IV of Norway as a baby in 1206 was transported by soldiers on skis through the hills between Gudbrandsdalen and Østerdalen valleys, this event inspired modern-day Birkebeinerrennet ski marathon. Ski warfare, the use of ski-equipped troops in war, is first recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. The speed and distance that ski troops are able to cover are comparable to that of light cavalry. Swedish writer Olaus Magnus&#x27;s 1555 &quot;A Description of the Northern Peoples&quot; describes skiers and their climbing skins in Scricfinnia in what is now Norway. The garrison in Trondheim used skis at least from 1675, and the Danish-Norwegian army included specialized skiing battalions from 1747 – details of military ski exercises from 1767 are retained. Skis were used in military exercises in 1747.

A 1593 inventory of the &quot;choicest rarities&quot; on display at the Leiden University included: 

In 1799, French traveler Jacques de la Tocnaye visited Norway and wrote in his travel diary: 
Norwegian immigrants used skis (&quot;Norwegian snowshoes&quot;) in the US Midwest from around 1836. Norwegian immigrant &quot;Snowshoe Thompson&quot; transported mail by skiing across the Sierra Nevada between California and Nevada from 1856. In 1888, Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen and his team crossed the Greenland icecap on skis. Norwegian workers on the Buenos Aires - Valparaiso railway line introduced skiing in South America around 1890. In 1910, Roald Amundsen used skis on his South Pole Expedition. In 1902, the Norwegian consul in Kobe imported ski equipment and introduced skiing to the Japanese, motivated by the death of Japanese soldiers during snowstorms.

== Military skiing ==
In the First World War, Austro-Hungarian troops on the Italian front used skis and wore snow camouflage smocks and overtrousers over their uniforms.

In the Second World War, the German armed forces published a manual for its ski troops in 1942. The 1942 Russian war documentary film &quot;Moscow Strikes Back&quot; shows a scene of a winter attack by Russian ski infantry supported by tanks.

==Sport==

The first recorded organized skiing exercises and races are from military uses of skis in Norwegian and Swedish infantries. For instance, details of military ski exercises in the Danish-Norwegian army from 1767 included downhill in rough terrain, target practice while skiing downhill, and 3 km cross-country skiing with full military backpack. Slalom (Norwegian: &quot;slalåm&quot;) is a word of Norwegian origin that has entered the international skiing vocabulary. In the 1800s, skiers in Telemark challenged each other on &quot;wild slopes&quot; (&quot;ville låmir&quot;), more gentle slopes had the adjective &quot;sla&quot;. Some races were on &quot;bumpy courses&quot; (&quot;kneikelåm&quot;) and sometimes included &quot;steep jumps&quot; (&quot;sprøytehopp&quot;) for difficulty. These 19th-century races in Telemark ran along particularly difficult trails usually from a steep mountain, along timber slides, and ended with a sharp turn (&quot;Telemark turn&quot;) on a field or icy lake.

==Evolution of equipment==

===Skis===
Asymmetrical skis were used at least in northern Finland and Sweden up until the 1930s. On one leg, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and on the other a shorter ski for kicking. The bottom of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in a similar manner to modern ski waxing. An early record of this type of skis survives in the works of Olaus Magnus. He associates them to Sami people and gives Sami names of &#x27;savek&#x27; and &#x27;golos&#x27; for the plain and skinned short ski. Finnish names for these are &quot;lyly and kalhu&quot; for long and short ski.

The seal hunters at the Gulf of Bothnia had developed a special long ski to sneak into shooting distance to the seals&#x27; breathing holes, though the ski was useful in moving in the packed ice in general and was made especially long, 3–4 meters, to protect against cracks in the ice. This is called skredstång in Swedish.

Around 1850, artisans in Telemark, Norway, invent the cambered ski. This ski arches up in the middle, under the binding, which distributes the skier&#x27;s weight more evenly across the length of the ski. Earlier plank-style skis had to be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under the skier&#x27;s weight. Norheim&#x27;s ski was also the first with a sidecut that narrowed the ski underfoot while the tip and tail remained wider. This enabled the ski to flex and turn more easily.

In 1950, Howard Head introduced the Head Standard, constructed by sandwiching aluminum alloy around a plywood core. The design included steel edges (invented in 1928 in Austria,) and the exterior surfaces were made of phenol formaldehyde resin which could hold wax. This hugely successful ski was unique at the time in having been designed for the recreational market, rather than for racing.
1962: a fibreglass ski, Kneissl&#x27;s White Star, was used by Karl Schranz to win two gold medals at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships. By the late &#x27;60s, fibreglass had mostly replaced aluminum.

In 1975, the torsion box ski construction design is patented. The patent is referenced by Kästle, Salomon, Rottefella, and Madshus, but in fact, torsion box skis became common beginning in 1962 with the introduction of the Dynamic VR7 and VR17 race skis. In 1993, Elan introduced the Elan SCX. These introduced a new ski geometry, common today, with a much wider tip and tail than waist. When tipped onto their edges, they bend into a curved shape and carve a turn. Other companies quickly followed suit, and it was realized in retrospect that &quot;It turns out that everything we thought we knew for forty years was wrong.&quot; The modern Twin-tip ski was introduced by Line in 1995.

=== Bindings ===
In the early days of skiing the binding was also similar to those of a contemporary snowshoe, generally consisting of a leather strap fastened over the toe of the boot. In the 1800s, skiing evolved into a sport and the toe strap was replaced by a metal clip under the toe. This provided a much greater grip on the boot, allowing the ski to be pushed sideways. The heel strap also changed over time; in order to allow a greater range of motion, a spring was added to allow the strap to lengthen when the boot was rotated up off the ski.

This buckled strap was later replaced by a metal cable. The cable binding remained in use, and even increased in popularity, throughout this period as cross-country skiing developed into a major sport of its own. Change eventually came through the evolution of the Rottefella binding, first introduced in 1927. The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s. It has now generally been replaced by the NNN system.

The introduction of ski lifts in 1908 led to the evolution of alpine skiing as a sport. In the past, skiers would have to ski or walk up the hills they intended to ski down. With the lift, the skiers could leave their skis on and would be skiing downhill all the time. The need to unclip the heel for cross-country use was eliminated, at least at resorts with lifts. As lifts became more common, especially with the introduction of the chairlift in 1936, the ski world split into cross-country and downhill, a split that remains to this day.

In 1937, Hjalmar Hvam broke his leg skiing, and while recuperating from surgery, invented the Saf-Ski toe binding.

=== Boots ===


Ski boots were leather winter boots, held to the ski with leather straps. As skiing became more specialized, so too did ski boots, leading to the splitting of designs between those for alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.

Modern skiing developed as an all-around sport with uphill, downhill, and cross-country portions. The introduction of the cable binding started a parallel evolution of binding and boot. Boots with the sole extended rearward to produce a flange for the cable to firmly latch became common, as did designs with semi-circular indentations on the heel for the same purpose.

With the introduction of ski lifts, the need for skiing to get to the top of the hill was eliminated, and a much stiffer design was preferred, providing better control over the ski when sliding downhill.

===Glide and grip===

Johannes Scheffer in &quot;Argentoratensis Lapponiæ&quot; (&quot;History of Lapland&quot;) in 1673 probably gave the first recorded instruction for ski wax application He advised skiers to use pine tar pitch and rosin. Ski waxing was also documented in 1761.

1934 saw limited production of solid aluminum skis in France. Wax does not stick to aluminum, so the base under the foot included grips to prevent backsliding, a precursor of modern fish scale waxless skis. In 1970 waxless Nordic skis were made with fishscale bases. Klister, a sticky material, which provides grip on snow of all temperatures that has become coarse-grained as a result of multiple freeze-thaw cycles or wind packing, was invented and patented in 1913 by Peter Østbye. Recent advancements in wax have been the use of surfactants, introduced in 1974 by Hertel Wax, and fluorocarbons, introduced in 1986, to increase water and dirt repellency and increase glide. Many companies, including Swix, Toko, Holmenkol, Briko, and Maplus are dedicated to ski wax production and have developed a range of products to cover various conditions.

===Poles===

Early skiers used one long pole or spear. The first depiction of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741. In 1959 Ed Scott introduced the large-diameter, tapered shaft, lightweight aluminum ski pole.

Early adaptations of the ski pole featured wood or metal baskets above the tip. These designs were deemed too heavy, and following the conclusion of World War II, it became much more common to make the baskets out of some plastic material, a practice which has continued until today.

In order to better adapt to different styles of skiing, modern skiers use a slightly different pole for each type of skiing. In racing, the poles are typically a much lighter weight, featuring a curve and durable design. Cross country and freestyle skiing utilize much longer, straight poles, so as to make it easier for the skier to reach the ground while traversing the mountain. This is particularly important in the uphill portions of the courses featured in cross country skiing.

=== Goggles ===
The invention of the modern ski goggle came in the 1960&#x27;s with the creation of the double-lens ski goggle. Created by Bob Smith, an orthodontist from Sun Valley, Utah, these goggles allowed for air flow behind the lens in order to limit fogging and improve the skier&#x27;s vision. Although uncommon, injuries to the user&#x27;s eyes were still occurring due to the use of fragile materials in the lenses of many goggles. It wasn&#x27;t until the ASTM passed regulations for the materials with which ski goggles could be made from that this issue was addressed. This specification stated that goggles &quot;...required the lenses to be made either of tempered glass or one of the available lens plastics, CR-39 or polycarbonate.&quot; The strength of these materials was deemed to be shatter-resistant enough for use in ski goggles, though polycarbonate is the best choice of these three. Despite these findings and analysis, in 1984, shortly after the passing of these regulations, it was found that &quot;the mix of lens materials was approximately 78% glass, 11% plastic, and 11% polycarbonate.&quot;

Many modern iterations of ski goggles feature technology which allows the skier to quickly swap the type of lens in their goggles, without needing to bring multiple pairs along with them. The lens of these goggles is typically held in place using magnets or a switch system, and the replacement of these lens can allow the user to swap the amount of tint through which they look to adapt to different lighting situations.

<text>In Jamaican dancehall music, a riddim is the instrumental accompaniment to a song and is synonymous with the rhythm section. Jamaican music genres that use the term consist of the &quot;riddim&quot; plus the &quot;voicing&quot; (vocal part) sung by the deejay. A given riddim, if popular, may be used in dozens—or even hundreds—of songs, not only in recordings but also in live performances.

Since the 1970s, riddims have accompanied reggae music and through the 1980s, more widely known as dancehall. As seen in dancehall music, there is a voicing part – sung by the DJ – over some riddim that has probably been widely used in many other songs. There is a unique establishment in the combination of riddims and voicing. 

By 1993, Jamaica finally established a copyright act, but producers still face difficulty in establishing profit. Through proper registration, many artists now work on negotiating their royalties and taking it more seriously. The unique nature of dancehall and riddims have been highly influential on the numerous remixes that now circulate throughout R&amp;B and hip-hop music.

==Definition==
Some classic riddims, such as &quot;Nanny Goat&quot; and &quot;Real Rock&quot; both produced by Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd, are essentially the accompaniment tracks of the original 1960s reggae songs with those names. Since the 1980s, however, riddims started to be originally composed by producers/beatmakers, who give the riddims original names and, typically, contract artists to voice over them. Thus, for example, &quot;Diwali&quot; is the name not of a song, but of a riddim created by Steven &quot;Lenky&quot; Marsden, subsequently used as the basis for several songs, such as Sean Paul&#x27;s &quot;Get Busy&quot; and Bounty Killer&#x27;s &quot;Sufferer.&quot;

&quot;Riddims are the primary musical building blocks of Jamaican popular songs... At any given time, ten to fifteen riddims are widely used in dancehall recordings, but only two or three of these are the &quot;now ting&quot; (i.e., the latest riddims that everyone must record over if they want to get them played in the dance or on radio)... In dancehall performing, those whose timing is right on top of the rhythm are said to be &quot;riding di riddim&quot;.

==Bass culture==
The bass culture of Jamaican sonic sensibilities is characterized with less emphasis on melody and large emphasis on the drum beats and low frequency bass vibrations to draw attention to the social grounding to the culture. These aspects of Jamaican music are expressed visually through the Dancehall choreography and its African inspired folk traditions, which emphasize earthly connection through flat-footed stamping and “bumper-grinding sexually explicit choreography, where the bass note is struck by the body itself—displaying its fecundity and celebrating its fertility”. This bass culture is also embodied sonically by the music&#x27;s heartbeat, the bass lines often described as riddims, produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These riddims offer a sonic foundation on top of which different other sounds are incorporated to form innumerable versions.

==Usage==
Riddims are the instrumental background (the rhythm section) of reggae, lovers rock, dub, ragga, dancehall, soca, bouyon, sega and also reggaeton, which itself is largely based on the Dem Bow and Fish Market riddims by Steely &amp; Clevie from the early 1990s.

In other musical contexts, a riddim would be called a groove or beat. In most cases, the term &quot;riddim&quot; is used in reference to the entire background track or rhythm section, but in older roots riddims, &quot;riddim&quot; is used to reference a certain bass line and drum pattern. Often a melody is associated with the riddim, and occasionally an artist will produce two different songs with the same riddim (e.g. Elephant Man&#x27;s &quot;Ele Melody&quot; and &quot;Father Elephant&quot; were both produced using the Kopa riddim, produced by Supa Dups). Riddims began forming popular in the early 1960s with the evolving role of the DJ. The work of DJs became less of shouting throughout points during a song, but more focused on an aesthetic with the voicings over these instrumental riddims. A specific DJ, DJ U-Roy, revolutionized the practice with studio recordings of these DJ voicings as his recordings skyrocketed on the charts in Jamaica in the 70s, thus leading to the beginning stages of dancehall. Riddims, therefore, became the standard practice for dancehall as it has progressed. Today, the same practices combining riddim and voicing still takes precedence in dancehall. Other live performances like at clubs or along the streets feature the use of sound systems in which there are usually medleys of different songs that all use the instrumental accompaniment.

While a staple of mainly reggae-based music, an emerging electronic music genre as a sub-genre of dubstep also called riddim has recently emerged.

==Types==
African in origin (see clave (rhythm) and bell pattern), riddims can generally be categorized into three types. One of the oldest types of riddim is the classical riddim providing roots reggae, dub, and lovers rock with instrumentals, such as Bam Bam, produced by Sly &amp; Robbie. The second type is the ragga riddim backing raggamuffin and dancehall songs, such as the Juice riddim, produced by Richard &quot;Shams&quot; Browne. The third type is the digital riddim, such as Sleng Teng, Punaany Riddim &amp; Duck Riddim produced by King Jammy.

A number of riddims take their name and influence from African-Jamaican religious drumming such as the Kumina riddim, created in 2002 by Sly and Robbie, and Burru.

==Producers==
Different producers often develop their own versions of the same riddim, such as the Punanny riddim, which has distinct versions crafted by Steely &amp; Clevie and by Ward 21; the Buzz Riddim, which was produced by Troyton Rami &amp; Roger Mackenzie and officially launched dancehall deejay Sean Paul into superstardom (&quot;Gimme the Light&quot; from the Buzz Riddim won him his first Grammy for Best Reggae Album). Different artists often perform on top of the same riddims with different lyrics and different vocal styles, ranging from singing to toasting. As an example, Beenie Man&#x27;s song &quot;My Wish&quot;, Mr. Vegas&#x27; song &quot;Go Up&quot;, and T.O.K.&#x27;s &quot;Man ah Bad Man&quot; are all based on the Juice riddim. Many riddims are named after the song that was recorded on that instrumental track for the first time (or, in some cases, the song that becomes the most popular on a given riddim). For example, the Satta Massagana riddim is named after the Abyssinians&#x27; original song &quot;Satta Massagana&quot;.
