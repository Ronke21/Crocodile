<text>Wahhabism () is a religious revivalist movement within Sunni Islam named after the 18th-century Hanbali scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. It was initially established in the central Arabian region of Najd and later spread to other parts of the Arabian Peninsula, and is today followed primarily in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

The Wahhabi movement staunchly denounced rituals related to the veneration of Muslim saints and pilgrimages to their tombs and shrines, which were widespread amongst the people of Najd. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab and his followers were highly inspired by the Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyya (1263–/AH 661–728) who advocated a return to the purity of the first three generations () to rid Muslims of (innovation) and regarded his works as core scholarly references in theology. While being influenced by Hanbali school, the movement repudiated &quot;Taqlid&quot; to legal authorities, including oft-cited scholars such as Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim (/AH 751).

Wahhabism has been characterized by historians as &quot;puritanical&quot;, while its adherents describe it as an Islamic &quot;reform movement&quot; to restore &quot;pure monotheistic worship&quot;. Socio-politically, the movement represented the first major Arab-led revolt against the Turkish, Persian and foreign empires that had dominated the Islamic world since the Mongol invasions and the fall of Abbasid Caliphate in the 13th century; and would later serve as a revolutionary impetus for 19th-century pan-Arab trends. In 1744, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab formed a pact with a local leader, Muhammad bin Saud, establishing a politico-religious alliance with the Saudi monarchy that lasted for more than 250 years. The Wahhabi movement gradually rose to prominence as an influential anti-colonial reform trend in the Islamic world that advocated the re-generation of the social and political prowess of Muslims. Its revolutionary themes inspired several Islamic revivalists, scholars, pan-Islamist ideologues and anti-colonial activists as far as West Africa.

For more than two centuries, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s teachings were championed as the official creed in the three Saudi States. As of 2017, changes to Saudi religious policy by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have led to widespread crackdowns on Islamists in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arab world. By 2021, the waning power of the religious clerics brought about by the social, economic, political changes, and the Saudi government&#x27;s promotion of a nationalist narrative that emphasizes non-Islamic components, led to what has been described as the &quot;post-Wahhabi era&quot; of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia&#x27;s annual commemoration of its founding day on 22 February since 2022, which marked the establishment of Emirate of Dir&#x27;iyah by Muhammad ibn Saud in 1727 and de-emphasized his pact with Ibn Abd al-Wahhab in 1744, has led to the official &quot;uncoupling&quot; of the religious clergy by the Saudi state.

== Name and definition ==

=== Etymology ===

The Arabic term translates in English to &quot;of &quot;, meaning &quot;the Bestower&quot;, which is one of the names of God in Islam. The word is primarily an exonym and was not used by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab or by his partisans, who called themselves (&quot;the Unitarians&quot;) derived from , the central Islamic tenet denoting the oneness of God. Later, many followers adopted the term instead, ascribing themselves to the first three generations known as the .

The designation for this movement was likely first used by Sulayman ibn Abd al-Wahhab, an ardent critic of his brother&#x27;s views, who used the term in his purported treatise . The movement&#x27;s political opponents widely used the term to denounce it. Modern-day followers of the movement continue to reject the term for themselves.

The term &quot;Wahhabi&quot; should not be confused with &quot;Wahbi&quot;, which is the dominant creed within Ibadism.

=== Definition ===
Alongside its basic definition as an 18th century reformist/revivalist movement, the Wahhabi movement has also been characterized as a &quot;movement for sociomoral reconstruction of society&quot;, &quot;a conservative reform movement&quot;, and a sect with a &quot;steadfastly fundamentalist interpretation of Islam in the tradition of Ibn Hanbal&quot;.

Supporters of the Wahhabi movement characterize it as being &quot;pure Islam&quot;, indistinct from Salafism, and in fact &quot;the true Salafist movement&quot; seeking &quot;a return to the pristine message of the Prophet&quot; and attempted to free Islam from &quot;superimposed doctrines&quot; and superstitions&quot;. Opponents of the movement and what it stands for label it as &quot;a misguided creed that fosters intolerance, promotes simplistic theology, and restricts Islam&#x27;s capacity for adaption to diverse and shifting circumstances&quot;. The term &quot;Wahhabism&quot; has also become as a blanket term used inaccurately to refer to &quot;any Islamic movement that has an apparent tendency toward misogyny, militantism, extremism, or strict and literal interpretation of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;hadith&quot;&quot;.

Abdallah al Obeid, the former dean of the Islamic University of Medina and member of the Saudi Consultative Council, has characterized the movement as &quot;a political trend&quot; within Islam that &quot;has been adopted for power-sharing purposes&quot;, but not a distinct religious movement, because &quot;it has no special practices, nor special rites, and no special interpretation of religion that differ from the main body of Sunni Islam&quot;.

=== Naming controversy ===
Ibn Abd al-Wahhab himself or his followers typically refer to themselves as &quot;Salafi&quot;, &quot;Sunni&quot; or &quot;Muwahhidun&quot;. The term &quot;Wahhabi&quot; was probably first used by Sulayman ibn Abd al-Wahhab, a staunch opponent of his brother&#x27;s views until /AH 1190, who declared the Wahhabi movement as the personal interpretation of its leader. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and his movement&#x27;s early followers referred to themselves as &quot;&quot;al-muwahhidun&quot;&quot; (monotheists; derived from &quot;Tawhid&quot; (the oneness of God). The movement&#x27;s present-day followers continue to reject the term and instead often refer to themselves as &quot;Salafi&quot; (also used by followers of other Islamic reform movements).

The term &quot;Wahhabism&quot; has frequently been used by external parties as a sectarian The term used in this manner &quot;most frequently used in countries where Salafis are a small minority&quot; with the intent of &quot;conjuring up images of Saudi Arabia&quot; and foreign interference. Labelling by the term &quot;Wahhabism&quot; has historically been expansive beyond the doctrinal followers of Muhammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab, who tend to all reject the label.

Since the colonial period, the Wahhabi epithet has been commonly invoked by various external observers to erroneously or pejoratively denote a wide range of reform movements across the Muslim world. During the colonial era, the British Empire had commonly employed the term to refer to those Muslim scholars and thinkers seen as obstructive to their imperial interests; punishing them under various pretexts. Many Muslim rebels inspired by Sufi &quot;Awliyaa&quot; (saints) and mystical orders, were targeted by the British Raj as part of a wider &quot;Wahhabi&quot; conspiracy which was portrayed as extending from Bengal to Punjab. Despite sharing little resemblance with the doctrines of Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab, outside observers of the Muslim world have frequently traced various religious purification campaigns across the Islamic World to Wahhabi influence. According to Qeyamuddin Ahmed:
In general, the so-called &quot;Wahhabis&quot; do not like – or at least did not like – the term. Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab was averse to the elevation of scholars and other individuals, including using a person&#x27;s name to label an Islamic school (&quot;madhhab&quot;). Due to its perceived negative overtones, the members of the movement historically identified themselves as &quot;Muwahhidun&quot;, Muslims, etc. and more recently as &quot;Salafis&quot;. According to Robert Lacey &quot;the Wahhabis have always disliked the name customarily given to them&quot; and preferred to be called &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; (Unitarians). Another preferred term was simply &quot;Muslims&quot;, since they considered their creed to be the &quot;pure Islam&quot;. However, critics complain these terms imply that non-Wahhabi Muslims are either not monotheists or not Muslims. Additionally, the terms &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; and Unitarians are associated with other sects, both extant and extinct.

Other terms Wahhabis have been said to use and/or prefer include &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot; (&quot;People of the Hadith&quot;), &quot;Salafi dawah&quot; (&quot;Salafi preaching&quot;), or &quot;al-da&#x27;wa ila al-tawhid&quot; (&quot;preaching of monotheism&quot; for the school rather than the adherents), &quot;al-Tariqa al-Salafiyya&quot; (&quot;the way of the pious ancestors&quot;), &quot;the reform or Salafi movement of the Sheikh&quot; (the sheikh being Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab), etc. Their self-designation &quot;People of the Sunnah&quot; was important for Wahhabism&#x27;s authenticity, because during the Ottoman period only Sunnism was the legitimate doctrine.

Other writers such as Quinton Wiktorowicz, urge use of the term &quot;Salafi&quot;, maintaining that &quot;one would be hard pressed to find individuals who refer to themselves as &quot;Wahhabis&quot; or organizations that use &quot;Wahhabi&quot; in their title, or refer to their ideology in this manner (unless they are speaking to a Western audience that is unfamiliar with Islamic terminology; even then, its use is limited and often appears as &quot;Salafi/Wahhabi&quot;)&quot;. A &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist writes that Saudis &quot;abhor&quot; the term &quot;Wahhabism&quot;, &quot;feeling it sets them apart and contradicts the notion that Islam is a monolithic faith&quot;.

Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud for example has attacked the term as &quot;a doctrine that doesn&#x27;t exist here&quot; [in Saudi Arabia] and challenged users of the term to locate any &quot;deviance of the form of Islam practiced in Saudi Arabia from the teachings of the Quran and Prophetic Hadiths&quot;. Professor Ingrid Mattson stated that &quot;&quot;Wahhbism&quot; is not a sect: It is a social movement that began 200 years ago to rid Islam of rigid cultural practices that had [been] acquired over the centuries.&quot; In an interview given to &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine in 2018, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asserted that the Western usage of the term itself has been a misnomer. Stating that the terminology itself is indefinable, Mohammed bin Salman said: &quot;When people speak of Wahhabism, they don&#x27;t know exactly what they are talking about.&quot;

On the other hand, according to authors at Global Security and Library of Congress the term is now commonplace and used even by Wahhabi scholars in the Najd, a region often called the &quot;heartland&quot; of Wahhabism. Journalist Karen House calls &quot;Salafi&quot; &quot;a more politically correct term&quot; for &quot;Wahhabi&quot;. In any case, according to Lacey, none of the other terms have caught on, and so like the Christian Quakers, Wahhabis have &quot;remained known by the name first assigned to them by their detractors&quot;. However, the confusion is further aggravated due to the common practice of various authoritarian governments broadly using the label &quot;Wahhabi extremists&quot; for all opposition, legitimate and illegitimate, to justify massive repressions on any dissident.

Another movement, whose adherents are also called &quot;Wahhabi&quot; but whom were Ibaadi Kharijites, has caused some confusion in North and sub-Saharan Africa, where the movement&#x27;s leader – Abd al-Wahhab ibn Abd al-Rahman – lived and preached in the eighth century CE. This movement is often mistakenly conflated with the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; movement of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab.

=== Wahhabism and Salafism ===
There is considerable confusion between Wahhabism and Salafism, but many scholars and critics draw clear distinctions between the two terms. According to analyst Christopher M. Blanchard, Wahhabism refers to &quot;a conservative Islamic creed centered in and emanating from Saudi Arabia&quot;, while Salafism is &quot;a more general puritanical Islamic movement that has developed independently at various times and in various places in the Islamic world&quot;. However, many view Wahhabism as the Salafism native to Arabia. Ahmad Moussalli tends to agree Wahhabism is a subset of Salafism, saying &quot;As a rule, all &quot;Wahhabis&quot; are &quot;salafists&quot;, but not all &quot;salafists&quot; are &quot;Wahhabis&quot;.&quot; Quintan Wiktorowicz asserts modern Salafists consider the 18th-century scholar Muhammed bin &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab and many of his students to have been Salafis.

According to Joas Wagemakers, associate professor of Islamic and Arabic Studies at Utrecht University, &quot;Salafism&quot; consists of broad movements of Muslims across the world who aspire to live according to the precedents of the &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot;; whereas &quot;Wahhabism&quot; – a term rejected by its adherents – refers to the specific brand of reformation (&quot;islah&quot;) campaign that was initiated by the 18th century scholar Muhammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab and evolved through his subsequent disciples in the central Arabian region of Najd. Despite their relations with Wahhabi Muslims of Najd; other Salafis have often differed theologically with the Wahhabis and hence do not identify with them. These included significant contentions with Wahhabis over their unduly harsh enforcement of their beliefs, their lack of tolerance towards other Muslims and their deficient commitment to their stated opposition to &quot;taqlid&quot; and advocacy of &quot;ijtihad&quot;.

In doctrines of &quot;&#x27;Aqida&quot; (creed), Wahhabis and Salafis resemble each other; particularly in their focus on &quot;Tawhid&quot;. However, the &quot;Muwahidun&quot; movement historically were concerned primarily about &quot;Tawhid al-Rububiyya&quot; (Oneness of Lordship) and &quot;Tawhid al-Uloohiyya&quot; (Oneness of Worship) while the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement placed an additional emphasis on &quot;Tawhid al-Asma wa Sifat&quot; (Oneness of Divine Names and Attributes); with a literal understanding of God&#x27;s Names and Attributes.

== History ==
The Wahhabi movement started as a revivalist and reform movement in the Arabian Peninsula during the early 18th century, whose adherents described themselves as &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; (Unitarians). A young Hanbali cleric named Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703–/AH 1115–1206), the leader of the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; and eponym of the Wahhabi movement, called upon his disciples to denounce certain beliefs and practices associated with Sufi orders as idolatrous impurities and innovations in Islam (&quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot;). His movement emphasized adherence to the Quran and &quot;hadith&quot;, and advocated the use of &quot;ijtihad&quot;. Eventually, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab formed a pact with a local leader, Muhammad bin Saud, offering political obedience and promising that protection and propagation of the Wahhabi movement meant &quot;power and glory&quot; and rule of &quot;lands and men&quot;.

18th and 19th century European historians, scholars, travellers and diplomats compared the Wahhabi movement with various Euro-American socio-political movements in the Age of Revolutions. Calvinist scholar John Ludwig Burckhardt, author of the well-received works &quot;&quot;Travels in Arabia&quot; (1829) and &quot;Notes on the Bedouins and Wahábys&quot;&quot; (1830), described the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; as Arabian locals who resisted Turkish hegemony and its &quot;Napoleonic&quot; tactics. Historian Loius Alexander Corancez in his book &quot;Histoire des Wahabis&quot; described the movement as an Asiatic revolution that sought a powerful revival of Arab civilisation by establishing a new order in Arabia and cleansing all the irrational elements and superstitions which had been normalised through Sufi excesses from Turkish and foreign influences. Scottish historian Mark Napier attributed the successes of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s revolution to assistance from &quot;frequent interpositions of Heaven&quot;.

After the Unification of Saudi Arabia, Wahhabis were able spread their political power and consolidate their rule over the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. After the discovery of petroleum near the Persian Gulf in 1939, Saudi Arabia had access to oil export revenues, revenue that grew to billions of dollars. This moneyspent on books, media, schools, universities, mosques, scholarships, fellowships, lucrative jobs for journalists, academics and Islamic scholarsgave Wahhabi ideals a &quot;preeminent position of strength&quot; in Islam around the world.

== Relations with other Islamic reform movements ==
===Islamic revivalism===

The Wahhabi movement was part of the Islamic revivalist trends of the 18th and 19th centuries; such as the Mahdist movement in 19th century Sudan, Senussi movement in Libya, Fulani movement of Uthman Dan Fodio in Nigeria, Faraizi movement of Haji Shariatullah (1784–1840) in Bengal, the South Asian &quot;Mujahidin&quot; movement of Sayyid Ahmed Barelvi (1786–1831) and the Padri movement (1803–1837) in Indonesia, all of which are considered precursors to the Arab &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement of late nineteenth century. These movements sought an Islamic Reform, renewal and socio-moral re-generation of the society through a direct return to the fundamental Islamic sources (&quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;) and responded to the military, economic, social, moral, cultural stagnation of the Islamic World. The cause of decline was identified as the departure of Muslims from the Islamic values of the early Muslims during the era of the &quot;Salaf&quot;, brought about by the infiltration and assimilation of local and un-Islamic beliefs and practices. The prescribed cure for Muslim societies was therefore a return to &quot;true Islam&quot;.

=== Kadizadeli ===
Kadizadeli (also &quot;Qādīzādali&quot;) was a seventeenth-century puritanical fundamentalist religious movement in the Ottoman Empire that followed Kadızade Mehmed (1582–1635), a revivalist Islamic preacher. Kadızade and his followers were determined rivals of Sufism and popular religion. They condemned many of the Ottoman practices that Kadızade felt were bidʻah &quot;non-Islamic innovations&quot;, and passionately supported &quot;reviving the beliefs and practices of the first Muslim generation in the first/seventh century&quot; (&quot;enjoining good and forbidding wrong&quot;).

Driven by zealous and fiery rhetoric, Kadızade Mehmed was able to inspire many followers to join in his cause and rid themselves of any and all corruption found inside the Ottoman Empire. Leaders of the movement held official positions as preachers in the major mosques of Baghdad, and &quot;combined popular followings with support from within the Ottoman state apparatus&quot;. Between 1630 and 1680 there were many violent quarrels that occurred between the Kadızadelis and those that they disapproved of. As the movement progressed, activists became &quot;increasingly violent&quot; and Kadızadelis were known to enter &quot;mosques, tekkes and Ottoman coffeehouses in order to mete out punishments to those contravening their version of orthodoxy.&quot;

=== Ahl-i-Hadith ===

The Wahhabi movement was part of the overall current of various Islamic revivalist trends in the 18th century. It would be influenced by and in turn, influence many other Islamic reform-revivalist movements across the globe. The Ahl-i Hadith movement of Indian subcontinent was a Sunni revivalist movement inspired by the thoughts of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, al-Shawkani, and Syed Ahmad Barelvi. They condemned &quot;taqlid&quot; and advocated &quot;ijtihad&quot; based on scriptures. Founded in the mid-19th century in Bhopal, it places great emphasis on hadith studies and condemns imitation to the canonical law schools. They identify with the early school of Ahl al-Hadith. During the late 19th century, Wahhabi scholars would establish contacts with Ahl-i-Hadith and many Wahhabi students would study under the Ahl-i-Hadith &quot;ulama&quot;, and later become prominent scholars in the Saudi Wahhabi establishment.

The Wahhabi and Ahl-i-Hadith movements both oppose Sufi practices such as visiting shrines and seeking aid at the tombs of Islamic saints. Both the movements revived the teachings of the medieval Sunni theologian and jurist, Ibn Taymiyya, whom they both consider a Shaykh al-Islam. Suffering from the instabilities of 19th-century Arabia, many Wahhabi &quot;ulama&quot; would make their way to India and study under Ahl-i-Hadith patronage. After the establishment of Saudi Arabia and the subsequent oil boom, the Saudi Sheikhs would repay their debts by financing the Ahl-i-Hadith movement. The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia Ibn Baz strongly supported the movement, and prominent Ahl-i-Hadith scholars were appointed to teach in Saudi Universities.

=== &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement ===
During the early 19th century, Egyptian Muslim scholar al-Jabarti had defended the Wahhabi movement. From the 19th century, prominent Arab &quot;Salafiyya&quot; reformers would maintain correspondence with Wahhabis and defend them against Sufi attacks. These included Shihab al Din al Alusi, Abd al Hamid al Zahrawi, Abd al Qadir al Jabarti, Abd al Hakim al Afghani, Nu&#x27;man Khayr al-Din Al-Alusi, Mahmud Shukri Al Alusi and his disciple Muhammad Bahjat al-Athari, Jamal al-Din al-Qasimi, , Muhibb al-Din al-Khatib, Muhammad Hamid al Fiqi and most notably, Muhammad Rasheed Rida who was considered as the &quot;leader of Salafis&quot;. All these scholars would correspond with Arabian and Indian &quot;Ahl-i-Hadith&quot; scholars and champion the reformist thought. They shared a common interest in opposing various Sufi practices, denouncing blind following and reviving correct theology and Hadith sciences. They also opened Zahiriyya library, Salafiyya library, &quot;Al Manar&quot; Library, etc., propagating Salafi thought as well as promoting scholars like Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Hazm. Rashid Rida would succeed in his efforts to rehabilitate Wahhabis in the Islamic World and would attain the friendship of many Najdi scholars. With the support of the Third Saudi State by the 1920s, a concept of &quot;Salafiyya&quot; emerged on a global scale claiming heritage to the thought of 18th-century Islamic reform movements and the pious predecessors (&quot;Salaf&quot;). Many of Rida&#x27;s disciples would be assigned to various posts in Saudi Arabia and some of them would remain in Saudi Arabia. Others would spread the &quot;Salafi da&#x27;wa&quot; to their respective countries. Prominent amongst these disciples were the Syrian Muhammad Bahjat al-Bitar (1894–1976), Egyptian Muhammad Hamid al-Fiqi (1892–1959) and the Moroccan Taqi al-Din al-Hilali (1894–1987).

The Syrian-Albanian Islamic scholar Al-Albani (), an avid reader of &quot;Al-Manar&quot; and also student of Muhammad Bahjat al-Bitar (disciple of Rida and Al-Qasimi), was an adherent to the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; methodology. Encouraged by their call for hadith re-evaluation and revival, he would invest himself in Hadith studies, becoming a renowned &quot;Muhaddith&quot;. He followed in the footsteps of the ancient &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot; school and took the call of Ahl-i-Hadith. In the 1960s, he would teach in Saudi Arabia making a profound influence therein. By the 1970s, Albani&#x27;s thoughts would gain popularity and the notion of &quot;Salafi Manhaj&quot; was consolidated.

=== Contemporary relations ===

Original &quot;Salafiyya&quot; and its intellectual heritage were not hostile to competing Islamic legal traditions. However, critics argue that as Salafis aligned with Saudi promoted neo-Wahhabism, religious concessions for Saudi political patronage distrted the early thrust of the renaissance movement. The early &quot;Salafiyya&quot; leaders like Muhammad ibn &#x27;Ali al-Shawkani (), Ibn al-Amir Al-San&#x27;ani (), Muhammad Rashid Rida (), etc. advocated &quot;Ijtihad&quot; (independent legal research) of Scriptures to solve the new contemporary demands and problems faced by Muslims living in a modern age through a pragmatic, juristic path faithful to the rich Islamic tradition. However, as other Salafi movements got increasingly sidelined by the Saudi-backed neo-Wahhabi Purists; the legal writings that were made easily accessible to the general public became often rigidly literalist and intolerant of the wider Sunni legal tradition, limited to a selective understanding of the Hanbalite works of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim.

The Syrian-Albanian Salafi &quot;Muhaddith&quot; Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani () publicly challenged the foundational methodologies of the neo-Wahhabite establishment. According to Albani, although Wahhabis doctrinally professed exclusive adherence to the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, the &quot;Hadith&quot;, and the &quot;Ijma&quot; of Salaf al-salih; in practice they almost solely relied on Hanbali jurisprudence for their &quot;fatwas&quot;—acting therefore as undeclared partisans of a particular &quot;madhab&quot;. As the most prominent scholar who championed anti-madhab doctrines in the 20th century, Albani held that adherence to a madhab was a &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; (religious innovation). Albani went as far as to castigate Ibn Abd al-Wahhab as a &quot;Salafi in creed, but not in &quot;Fiqh&quot;&quot;. He strongly attacked Ibn Abd al-Wahhab on several points; claiming that the latter was not a mujtahid in fiqh and accused him of imitating the Hanbali school. Albani&#x27;s outspoken criticism embarrassed the Saudi clergy, who finally expelled him from the Kingdom in 1963 when he issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; permitting women to uncover their face, which ran counter to Hanbali jurisprudence and Saudi standards.

In addition, Albani would also criticise Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab for his weakness in &quot;hadith&quot; sciences. He distinguished between Salafism and Wahhabism, criticizing the latter while supporting the former. He had a complex relationship to each movement. Although he praised Ibn Abd al-Wahhab in general terms for his reformist efforts and contributions to the Muslim &quot;Ummah&quot;, Albani nonetheless censured his later followers for their harshness in &quot;Takfir&quot;.

In spite of this, Albani&#x27;s efforts at &quot;hadith&quot; revivalism and his claims of being more faithful to the spirit of Wahhabism than Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab himself; made the former&#x27;s ideas highly popular amongst Salafi religious students across the World, including Saudi Arabia.

== Theology ==
In theology, Wahhabism is closely aligned with the Athari (traditionalist) school which represents the prevalent theological position of the Hanbali legal school. Athari theology is characterized by reliance on the zahir (apparent or literal) meaning of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;hadith&quot;, and opposition to rational argumentation in matters of &quot;&#x27;Aqidah&quot; (creed) favored by Ash&#x27;arite and Maturidite theologies. However, Wahhabis diverged in some points of theology from other Athari movements. Muhammad Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab did not view the issue of God&#x27;s Attributes and Names as a part of &quot;Tawhīd&quot; (monotheism), rather he viewed it in the broader context of &quot;aqāʾid&quot; (theology). While his treatises strongly emphasised &quot;Tawhid al-ulūhiyya&quot; (monotheism in Worship), Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab did not give prominence to the theology of God&#x27;s Names and Attributes that was central to Ibn Taymiyya and the Salafi movement. Following this approach, the early Wahhabi scholars had not elucidated the details of Athari theology such as Divine Attributes and other creedal doctrines. Influenced by the scholars of the Salafiyya movement, the later Wahhabis would revive Athari theological polemics beginning from the mid-twentieth century; which lead to charges of anthropomorphism against them by opponents such as Al-Kawthari. By contrast, the creedal treatises of early Wahhabis were mostly restricted to upholding Tawhid and condemning various practices of saint veneration which they considered as shirk (polytheism). They also staunchly opposed &quot;Taqlid&quot; and advocated &quot;Ijtihad&quot;.

Hammad Ibn &#x27;Atiq () was one of the first Wahhabi scholars who seriously concerned himself with the question of God&#x27;s Names and Attributes; a topic largely neglected by the previous Wahhabi scholars whose primary focus was limited to condemning idolatry and necrolatry. Ibn &#x27;Atiq established correspondence with Athari scholars like Sīddïq Hasān Khán, an influential scholar of the &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot; movement in the Islamic principality of Bhopal. In his letters, Ibn &#x27;Atiq praised &quot;Nayl al-Maram&quot;, Khan&#x27;s Salafi commentary on &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, which was published via prints in Cairo. He solicited Khan to accept his son as his disciple and requested Khan to produce and send more commentaries on the various treatises of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim. Khan accepted his request and embarked on a detailed study of the treatises of both the scholars. Hammad&#x27;s son Sa&#x27;d ibn Atiq would study under Khan and various traditionalist theologians in India. Thus, various Wahhabi scholars began making efforts to appropriate Ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s legacy into mainstream Sunni Islam by appropriating them to the broader traditionalist scholarship active across the Indian subcontinent, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Yemen, etc.

The Hanafite scholar Ibn Abi al-Izz&#x27;s &quot;sharh&quot; (explanation) on Al-Tahawi&#x27;s creedal treatise &quot;Al-Aqida al-Tahawiyya&quot; proved popular with the later adherents of the &quot;Muwahidun&quot; movement; who regarded it as a true representation of the work, free from Maturidi influences and as a standard theological reference for the Athari creed. A number of Salafi and Wahhabi scholars have produced super-commentaries and annotations on the &quot;sharh&quot;, including Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz, Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani, Saleh Al-Fawzan, etc. and is taught as a standard text at the Islamic University of Madinah.

=== Tawhid ===

David Commins describes the &quot;pivotal idea&quot; in Ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s teaching as being that &quot;Muslims who disagreed with his definition of monotheism were not ... misguided Muslims, but outside the pale of Islam altogether.&quot; This put Ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s teaching at odds with that of those Muslims who argued that the &quot;shahada&quot; (i.e., the testimony of faith; &quot;There is no god but God, Muhammad is his messenger&quot;) alone made one a Muslim, and that shortcomings in that person&#x27;s behavior and performance of other obligatory rituals rendered them &quot;a sinner&quot;, but &quot;not an unbeliever.&quot;
In Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s major work, a small book called &quot;Kitab al-Tawhid&quot;, he states that &quot;&#x27;Ibādah&quot; (Worship) in Islam consists of conventional acts of devotion such as the five daily prayers (&quot;salat&quot;); fasting for the holy month of Ramadan (Sawm); Dua (supplication); Istia&#x27;dha (seeking protection or refuge); Isti&#x27;âna (seeking help), and Istigātha to Allah (seeking benefits and calling upon Allah alone). Directing these deeds beyond Allahsuch as through &quot;du&#x27;a&quot; or &quot;Istigāthā&quot; to the dead – are acts of &quot;shirk&quot; and in violation of the tenets of &quot;Tawhid&quot; (monotheism). Based on the doctrine of &quot;Tawhid&quot; espoused in &quot;Kitab al-Tawhid&quot;, the followers of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab referred themselves by the designation &quot;Al-Muwahhidun&quot; (Unitarians).

The essence of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s justification for fighting his opponents in Arabia can be summed up as his belief that the original pagans fought by Muhammad &quot;affirmed that God is the creator, the sustainer and the master of all affairs; they gave alms, they performed pilgrimage and they avoided forbidden things from fear of God&quot;. What made them pagans whose blood could be shed and wealth plundered was that they performed sacrifices, vows and supplications to other beings. According to Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab, someone who perform such things even if their lives are otherwise exemplary; is not a Muslim but an unbeliever. Once such people have received the call to &quot;true Islam&quot;, understood it and then rejected it, their blood and treasure are forfeit. Clarifying his stance on &quot;Takfir&quot;, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab states:

The disagreement between Wahhabis and their opponents over the definition of worship (&quot;Ibadah&quot;) and monotheism (&quot;Tawhid&quot;) has remained much the same since 1740, according to David Commins: &quot;One of the peculiar features of the debate between Wahhabis and their adversaries is its apparently static nature... the main points in the debate [have] stay[ed] the same [since 1740].&quot; According to another source, Wahhabi jurists were unique for their literal interpretation of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Sunnah&quot; which tended to re-inforce local practices of the region of Najd. Whether the teachings of Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab included the need for social renewal and &quot;plans for socio-religious reform of society&quot; in the Arabian Peninsula, rather than simply a return to &quot;ritual correctness and moral purity&quot;, is disputed.

=== &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and &quot;Taqlid&quot; ===

The Wahhabi scholars upheld the right of qualified scholars to perform &quot;Ijtihad&quot; on legal questions and condemned &quot;Taqleed&quot; of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;. This stance pitted them against the Ottoman Sufi &quot;ulema&quot; who shunned &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and obligated &quot;Taqleed&quot;. The Arab &quot;Salafiyya&quot; reformers of 19th and 20th centuries would defend the Wahhabis on the &quot;Ijtihad&quot; issue as well as join forces with Wahhabis to condemn various Sufi practices and orders (&quot;tariqats&quot;) which they considered to be reprehensible &quot;Bid&#x27;ah&quot; (innovations). Prominent amongst those &quot;Salafiyya&quot; &quot;ulema&quot; who backed Wahhabism included Khayr al-Din al-Alusi, Tahir al-Jaza&#x27;iri, Muhammad Rashid Rida, Jamal al-Din al-Qasimi, Mahmud Shukri Al-Alusi, etc.

Condemning the doctrine of blind-following (&quot;Taqlid&quot;) prevalent amongst the masses and obliging them to directly engage with the Scriptures; Sulāyman ibn Ābd-Allah Aal-Shaykh (1785–/AH 1199–1233) wrote:
The Wahhabis furthermore rejected the idea of closure of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; as an innovated principle. Although they professed adherence to Hanbali school, they refrained from taking its precepts as final. Since the issue of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and &quot;Taqlid&quot; was amongst their principal concerns, Wahhabis developed a set of juristic procedures to solve legal questions. These included referencing &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot; as the primary sources of legislation. In case the solution was not accessible from the Scriptures, the principle of &quot;&#x27;Ijma&quot; (consensus) was employed. &quot;Ijma&quot; was restricted to Ahl al-Sunnah and consisted of consensus of &quot;Companions of the Prophet&quot;, &quot; Salaf as-Salih&quot; and the consensus of scholars. If any Hanbali interpretations were proven wrong through these principles, they must be abandoned. Defending their pro-Ijtihad stance, Wahhabis quoted Qur&#x27;anic verses which implied that only Qur&#x27;an and Hadith constituted the bases of sharia (Islamic law). Prominent Wahhabi &quot;Qadi&quot; of the Second Saudi State, &#x27;Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan Aal-Al Shaykh (1782–/AH 1196–1285) strongly condemned the practice of &quot;taqlid&quot; as a form of &quot;shirk&quot; (polytheism) in his treatises, writing:
The Wahhabis also advocated a principle in Islamic legal theory often referred to as &quot;the rule against &quot;Ijtihad&quot; reversal&quot;. This principle allows overturning a scholar&#x27;s &quot;fatwa&quot; (legal judgement) when he bases it on personal &quot;Ijtihad&quot; (personal legal reasoning), rather than a clear textual source from &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;. In effect, this allowed the Wahhabi &quot;qadis&quot; to remain autonomous. Opponents of Wahhabi movement harshly rebuked them for advocating &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and not recognising the finality of &quot;mad&#x27;habs&quot; (law schools).

== Practices ==
As a religious revivalist movement that works to bring Muslims back from what it considers as foreign accretions that have corrupted Islam, and believes that Islam is a complete way of life which has prescriptions for all aspects of life, Wahhabism is quite strict in what it considers Islamic behavior. The &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; movement has been described by &quot;The Economist&quot; as the &quot;strictest form of Sunni Islam&quot;. On the other hand, religious critics assert that Wahhabism is not strict, castigating it as a distorted version of Islam that deviates from traditional Shari&#x27;a law, and argue that their practices are neither typical nor mired in the roots of Islam. Unlike other schools of Sunnism, Wahhabis admonishes to ground Islamic principles solely on the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;, rejecting much material derived within Islamic culture.
This does not mean, however, that all adherents agree on what is required or forbidden, or that rules have not varied by area or changed over time. In Saudi Arabia, the strict religious atmosphere of Wahhabi doctrines were visible as late as the 1990s; such as the conformity in dress, public deportment, public prayers. Its presence was visible by the wide freedom of action of the &quot;religious police&quot;, clerics in mosques, teachers in schools, and &quot;Qadis&quot; (i.e. judges who are religious legal scholars) in Saudi courts.

=== Commanding right and forbidding wrong ===
Wahhabism is noted for its policy of &quot;compelling its own followers and other Muslims strictly to observe the religious duties of Islam, such as the five prayers&quot;, and for &quot;enforcement of public morals to a degree not found elsewhere&quot;. According to the American journalist Lawrence Wright, due to Wahhabi emphasis on the &quot;purification of Islam&quot;; the teaching becomes very repressive to the followers.

While other Muslims might urge salat prayer, modest dress, and abstention from alcohol, for Wahhabis, prayer &quot;that is punctual, ritually correct, and communally performed not only is urged but publicly required of men.&quot; Not only is modest dress prescribed, but the type of clothing that should be worn, especially by women (a black abaya, covering all but the eyes and hands) is specified. Not only is wine forbidden, but so are &quot;all intoxicating drinks and other stimulants, including tobacco&quot;. While being influenced by Hanbali doctrines, the movement repudiated &quot;Taqlid&quot; to legal authorities, including oft-cited scholars such as Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim (/AH 751).

Following the preaching and practice of ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab that coercion should be used to enforce following of &quot;sharia&quot; (Islamic law), an official committee was empowered to &quot;Command the Good and Forbid the Evil&quot; (the so-called &quot;religious police&quot;) in Saudi Arabiathe one country founded with the help of Wahhabi warriors and whose scholars and pious citizens dominated many aspects of the Kingdom&#x27;s life. Committee &quot;field officers&quot; enforce strict closing of shops at prayer time, segregation of the sexes, prohibition of the sale and consumption of alcohol, driving of motor vehicles by women, and other social restrictions.

A large number of practices was reported to be forbidden by Saudi Wahhabi officials, preachers or religious police. Practices that have been forbidden as Bid&#x27;a (innovation) or shirk (polytheism) and sometimes &quot;punished by flogging&quot; during Wahhabi history include performing or listening to music; dancing; fortune telling; amulets; non-religious television programs; smoking; playing backgammon, chess, or cards; drawing human or animal figures; acting in a play or writing fiction; dissecting cadavers, even in criminal investigations and for the purposes of medical research; recorded music played over telephones on hold; or the sending of flowers to friends or relatives who are in the hospital. Common Muslim practices Wahhabis believe are contrary to Islam include listening to music in praise of Muhammad, praying to God while visiting tombs (including the tomb of Muhammad), celebrating mawlid (birthday of the Prophet), the use of ornamentation on or in mosques, all of which is considered orthodoxy in the rest of the Islamic world. Until 2018, driving of motor vehicles by women was allowed in every country except the Wahhabi-dominated Saudi Arabia. Certain forms of Dream interpretation, practiced by the famously strict Taliban, is sometimes discouraged by Wahhabis.

Wahhabism also emphasizes &quot;Thaqafah Islamiyyah&quot; or Islamic culture and the importance of avoiding non-Islamic cultural practices and non-Muslim friendship no matter how innocent these may appear, on the grounds that the &quot;Sunnah&quot; forbids imitating non-Muslims. Foreign practices sometimes punished and sometimes simply condemned by Wahhabi preachers as un-Islamic, include celebrating foreign days (such as Valentine&#x27;s Day or Mothers Day) giving of flowers, standing up in honor of someone, celebrating birthdays (including the Prophet&#x27;s), keeping or petting dogs. Some Wahhabi activists have warned against taking non-Muslims as friends, smiling at or wishing them well on their holidays.
Wahhabis are not in unanimous agreement on what is forbidden as sin. Some Wahhabi preachers or activists go further than the official Saudi Arabian Council of Senior Scholars in forbidding (what they believe to be) sin. Juhayman al Utaybi declared football forbidden for a variety of reasons including it is a non-Muslim, foreign practice, because of the revealing uniforms and because of the foreign non-Muslim language used in matches. In response, the Saudi Grand Mufti rebuked such &quot;fatwas&quot; and called on the religious police to prosecute its author.

According to senior Saudi scholars, Islam forbids the traveling or working outside the home by a woman without their husband&#x27;s permissionpermission which may be revoked at any timeon the grounds that the different physiological structures and biological functions of the two sexes mean that each is assigned a distinctive role to play in the family. Sexual intercourse out of wedlock may be punished with flogging,

Despite this strictness, throughout these years senior Saudi scholars in the kingdom made exceptions in ruling on what is &quot;haram&quot; (forbidden). Foreign non-Muslim troops are forbidden in Arabia, except when the king needed them to confront Saddam Hussein in 1990; gender mixing of men and women is forbidden, and fraternization with non-Muslims is discouraged, but not at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). Until 2018, movie theaters and driving by women were forbidden, except at the ARAMCO compound in eastern Saudi, populated by workers for the company that provides almost all the government&#x27;s revenue. The exceptions made at KAUST were also in effect at ARAMCO.

More general rules of permissiveness changed over time. Abdulaziz Ibn Saud imposed Wahhabi doctrines and practices &quot;in a progressively gentler form&quot; as his early 20th-century conquests expanded his state into urban areas, especially the Hejaz. After vigorous debate Wahhabi religious authorities in Saudi Arabia allowed the use of paper money (in 1951), the abolition of slavery (in 1962), education of females (1964), and use of television (1965). Music, the sound of which once might have led to summary execution, is now commonly heard on Saudi radios. Minarets for mosques and use of funeral markers, which were once forbidden, are now allowed. Prayer attendance, which was once enforced by flogging, is no longer.

=== Appearance ===
The uniformity of dress among men and women in Saudi Arabia (compared to other Muslim countries in the Middle East) has been called by Arthur G Sharp as a &quot;striking example of Wahhabism&#x27;s outward influence on Saudi society&quot;, and an example of the Wahhabi belief that &quot;outward appearances and expressions are directly connected to one&#x27;s inward state.&quot;

A &quot;badge&quot; of a particularly pious Wahhabi man is a robe too short to cover the ankle, an untrimmed beard, and no cord (&quot;Agal&quot;) to hold the head scarf in place. The warriors of the Wahhabi Ikhwan religious militia wore a white turban in place of an &quot;agal&quot;.

=== Propagation ===

&quot;Da&#x27;wah Wahhabiyya&quot;, or the Wahhabi mission, is the idea of spreading Wahhabism throughout the world. Tens of billions of dollars have been spent by the Saudi government and charities on mosques, schools, education materials, scholarships, throughout the world to promote the Wahhabi influences. Tens of thousands of volunteers and several billion dollars also went in support of the jihad against the atheist communist regime governing Afghanistan.

== Beliefs ==

Adherents to the Wahhabi movement identify as Sunni Muslims. The primary Wahhabi doctrine is affirmation of the uniqueness and unity of God (&quot;Tawhid&quot;), and opposition to &quot;shirk&quot; (violation of tawhid&quot;the one unforgivable sin&quot;, according to Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab). They call for adherence to the beliefs and practices of the &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot; (exemplary early Muslims). They strongly oppose what they consider to be heterodox doctrines, particularly those held by the Sufi and Shiite traditions, such as beliefs and practices associated with the veneration of Prophets and saints. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab associated such practices with the culture of &quot;Taqlid&quot; (imitation to established customs) adored by pagan-cults of the &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; period. The movement emphasized reliance on the literal meaning of the &quot;Quran&quot; and &quot;hadith&quot;, rejecting rationalistic theology (&quot;kalam&quot;). Adherents of Wahhabism are favourable to derivation of new legal rulings (ijtihad) so long as it is true to the essence of the Quran, Sunnah and understanding of the &quot;salaf&quot;, and they do not regard this as &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; (innovation).
The movement is heavily influenced by the works of thirteenth-century Hanbali theologian Ibn Taymiyya who rejected &quot;Kalam&quot; theology; and his disciple Ibn Qayyim who elaborated Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s ideals. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s priority of ethics and worship over metaphysics, in particular, is readily accepted by Wahhäbis. Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab was a dedicated reader and student of Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s works, such as &quot;Al-Aqidah Al-Wasitiyya&quot;, &quot;Al-Siyasa Al-Shar&#x27;iyya&quot;, &quot;Minhaj al-Sunna&quot; and his various treatises attacking the cult of saints and certain forms of Sufism. Expressing great respect and admiration for Ibn Taymiyya; Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab wrote:
=== Loyalty and disassociation ===

According to various sourcesscholars,
former Saudi students, Arabic-speaking/reading teachers who have had access to Saudi text books,
and journalists Ibn `Abd al Wahhab preached and his successors preach that theirs is the one true form of Islam. According to the doctrine known as &quot;al-wala` wa al-bara`&quot; (literally, &quot;loyalty and disassociation&quot;), Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab argued that it was &quot;imperative for Muslims not to befriend, ally themselves with, or imitate non-Muslims or heretical Muslims&quot;, and that this &quot;enmity and hostility of Muslims toward non-Muslims and heretical had to be visible and unequivocal&quot;.
Even as late as 2003, entire pages in Saudi textbooks were devoted to explaining to undergraduates that all forms of Islam except Wahhabism were deviation. Shia critic Hamid Algar argued in 2002 that Saudi government had &quot;discreetly concealed&quot; this view from other Muslims &quot;over the years&quot; in order to depict itself as the defender of &quot;Muslim interests&quot;.

In a reply dated 2003, the Saudi Arabian government &quot;has strenuously denied the above allegations&quot;, including claims that &quot;their government exports religious or cultural extremism or supports extremist religious education.&quot;

=== On Jihad ===

Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab defined armed jihad as a sacred endeavour that must have a valid religious justification and which can only be declared by an &quot;Imam&quot;. The purpose of combat was to safeguard the community from the aggression and military attacks by various external threats. While early methods of his reformist efforts were based on preaching and educational efforts; state consolidation project of Emirate of Diriyah resulted in military conflicts with rival tribal chiefs. As a senior scholar, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab closely advised Emir Muhammad ibn Saud on military tactics; convincing him to pursue a largely defensive strategy and enjoining him to adhere to Islamic rules of warfare. The Emirate&#x27;s soldiers were rigorously forbidden from launching attacks targeting women, children and non-combatant civilians.

Throughout his letters and treatises, Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhāb maintained that the military campaigns of the Emirate of Dirʿiyya were strictly defensive and rebuked his opponents as being the first to initiate &quot;Takfir&quot;. Justifying the Wahhabi military campaigns as defensive operations against their enemies, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab asserts:
This defensive approach to warfare largely got abandoned after Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s retirement in 1773. Emir Abdulaziz, Muhammad ibn Saud&#x27;s son and successor, was an advocate of expansionist policy and launched offensive military campaigns. The excesses reported to have committed by soldiers of Emirate of Diriyah were regularly rebuked by the traditional Wahhabi Aal al-Shaykhs (descendants of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab) who took care to condemn and religiously delegitimise war crimes. Condemning the military excesses committed during the Wahhabi conquest of Mecca in 1218–1803, Abdullah ibn Muhammad Aal Ash-Shaykh (1751–/AH 1164–1244) stated:
=== Criticism of Shi&#x27;ism ===
Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab considered some beliefs and practices of the Shia to violate the doctrine of monotheism. DeLong-Bas maintains that when Ibn Abd al-Wahhab denounced the &quot;Rafidah&quot;, he was not using a derogatory name for Shia but denouncing &quot;an extremist sect&quot; within Shiism who call themselves &quot;Rafidah&quot;. He criticized them for assigning greater authority to their current leaders than to Muhammad in interpreting the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;sharia&quot;, and for denying the validity of the consensus (&quot;&#x27;Ijma&quot;) of the early Muslim community. In his treatise &quot;Risalah fi al-radd ala al-Rafidah&quot; (Treatise/Letter on the Denial/Rejection Pertaining to the Rafidah), Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab addressed thirty-two topics on points of both theology and law refuting the &quot;Raafida&quot;. In doing so, Ibn Abdul Wahhab spoke as a scholar who had studied Shi&#x27;i scholarly works, outlining a broad and systematic perspective of the Shi&#x27;i worldview and theology. He also believed that the Shia doctrine of infallibility of the imams constituted associationism with God. However, at no point did Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab &quot;suggest that violence of any sort should be used against the Rafidah or Shi&#x27;is&quot;. Rather, he implored his followers to peacefully clarify their own legal teachings. He instructed that this procedure of education and debate should be carried out with the support of truthful &quot;ulama&quot;, &quot;hadith&quot; transmitters, and righteous people employing logic, rhetoric, examination of the primary texts and scholarly debates.

Although Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab and his son and successor &#x27;Abdullah categorised various Shi&#x27;ite sects like &quot;Raafida&quot;, Zaydis, etc. as heretics and criticized many of their tenets, they had regarded them as Muslims. Abdullah&#x27;s son, Sulayman () would articulate a new doctrine of &quot;Takfir&quot; which set the foundations for the excommunication of Shi&#x27;ites outside the pale of Islam. Sulayman&#x27;s doctrines were revived by later scholars of the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; like &#x27;Abd al-Latif ibn &#x27;Abd al-Rahman (1810–1876) during the Ottoman annexation of Al-Hasa in 1871. Al-Hasa was a Shi&#x27;ite majority area, and Ottoman invasion was assisted by the British. The Ottoman invasion had become a major danger to the Emirate of Nejd. From 1871, &#x27;Abd al-Latif began to write tracts harshly condemning the Ottomans, Shi&#x27;ites and British as polytheists and called upon Muslims to boycott them. Integrating the concept of &quot;Hijra&quot; into his discourse of &quot;Takfir&quot;, &#x27;Abd al-Latif also forbade Muslims to travel or stay in the lands of Ottomans, &quot;Rafidis&quot;, British, etc. &#x27;Abd al-Latif viewed the Shi&#x27;ite sects of his time as idolators and placed them outside the pale of Islam.

=== Views on mysticism ===

According to Jeffry R. Halverson, the &quot;Muwahidun&quot; movement was characterised by a strong opposition to mysticism. Although this feature is typically attributed to the influence of the classical theologian Ibn Taymiyya, Jeffry Halverson states that Ibn Taymiyyah only opposed what he saw as Sufi excesses and never mysticism in itself, being himself a member of the &quot;Qadiriyyah&quot; Sufi order. DeLong-Bas writes that Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab did not denounce Sufism or Sufis as a group, but rather attacked specific practices which he saw as inconsistent with the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;hadith&quot;.

When he was asked on a religious matter, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab praised the pious Sufis, stating:
Scholars like Esther Peskes point to the cordial relations between the &quot;Muwahidun&quot; movement and the Sufi Shaykh Ahmad Ibn Idris and his followers in Mecca during the beginning of the 19th century; to aver that notions of absolute incompatibility between Sufism and Wahhabism are misleading. The early Wahhabi historiography had documented no mention that suggested any direct confrontations between Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab and contemporary Sufis nor did it indicate that his activism was directed specifically against Sufism. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s reforms were not aimed against socio-religious orientations such as Sufism; but were directed against the status quo prevalent in Islamic societies. Thus his efforts attempted a general transformation of Islamic societies, including Sufis and non-Sufis; the elite as well as the commoners. This resulted in the widespread desacralisation of the public sphere that heralded the advent of a new socio-political model in Arabia.

Explaining the stance of early Wahhabis on &quot;Tasawwuf&quot;, Abdullah Aal al-Shaykh (), son of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab writes:
=== Views on modernity ===

Since the Arabian Peninsula was never occupied by colonial powers, it wasn&#x27;t directly challenged by Western modernity until the mid-twentieth century, unlike the rest of the Islamic World. While the Saudi ruling class spearheaded modernization drive across the Kingdom; response of the religious establishment to the drastic influx of modernity was varied, ranging from scholars who rejected modern influences to tech-savvy clerics who eagerly embrace modern technology and social media. Various preachers harmonise pious lifestyle with modern culture while simultaneously engaging with Muslims of diverse backgrounds across the globe through social media networks. Assisted by scholarly guidance from a wide range of Islamic revivalists across the world like Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi, Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, etc. The Islamic University of Medina was established in 1961 to promote a pan-Islamic response to contemporary challenges and modern ideologies. To intellectually counter the ideological spread of Western liberalism, socialism and secular nationalism; numerous works of classical scholars like Ibn Kathir, Ibn Qudama, Ibn Hazm, Ibn Taymiyya, Ibn Qayyim, etc. were mass-distributed through Saudi publishing centres and during Pilgrimages.

On the other hand, some influential Wahhabi clerics had also been noteworthy for issuing various archaic &quot;fatawa&quot; such as declaring &quot;that the sun orbited the Earth&quot;, and forbidding &quot;women from riding bicycles on the grounds that they were &quot;the devil&#x27;s horses&quot;, and &quot;from watching TV without veiling, just in case the presenters could see them through the screen&quot;. The most senior cleric in Saudi Arabia as of early 2022, Saleh Al-Fawzan, once issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; forbidding &quot;all-you-can-eat buffets, because paying for a meal without knowing what you&#x27;ll be eating is akin to gambling&quot;. Despite this, the contemporary Wahhabi religious framework has largely been able to maintain Saudi Arabia&#x27;s global image as a pious society which is also aptly capable of addressing modern challenges.

To resolve the novel issues of the 20th century, King &#x27;Abd al-Azeez ibn Saud appointed Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Aal Al-Shaykh () as the Grand Mufti in 1953 to head &quot;Dar al-Ifta&quot;, the legal body tasked with crafting Wahhabi juristic response to the novel problems faced by Arabian Muslims. In 1971, &quot;Dar al-Ifta&quot; was re-organized to include a larger number of elder scholars to boost its intellectual output. Dar al-Ifta headed by the Saudi Grand Mufti, consists of two agencies: i) Board of Senior Ulema (BSU) ii) Permanent Committee for Scientific Research and Legal Opinions (C.R.L.O) Wahhabi scholars advocated a positive approach to embracing technology, political affairs, etc. while maintaining a traditional stance on social issues. Contemporary &quot;fatwas&quot; also demonstrate a receptive outlook on visual media, medical field, economic affairs, etc. &quot;Dar al-Ifta&quot; became an influential institution in Arabian society and it sought a balanced approach to modernity; positioning itself between religious idealism and varying societal, economic and material demands. As a result, some scholars like Fandy Mamoun have stated that &quot;In Saudi Arabia, different times and different places exist at once. Saudi Arabia is both a pre-modern and a post-modern society.&quot; The legal approach is characterized by taking from all law schools (&quot;Madhabs&quot;) through Scriptural precedents to sustain a legal system compatible with modernity.

In opposition to the &quot;Taqlid&quot; doctrine, Wahhabi scholars advocated the proof-evaluation theory which believes in the continuous appearance of absolute &quot;Mujtahids&quot; (&quot;Mujtahid Mutlaq&quot;) and claims an &quot;&#x27;Ijma&quot; (scholarly consensus) that the doors of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; remain always open. This juristic approach had enabled flexibility in response of Wahhabi legal bodies to modernity. These include the encouragement of mass-media like television, internet, etc. to promote virtue. Internet would be made publicly accessible to Saudi citizens as early as 1997. In 2000 &quot;fatwa&quot; on the internet, Grand Mufti ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz Āal al-Shaykh explains:
In the financial sector, Wahhabi approach is based on Islamic economics. Islamic banking system is encouraged and digital transactions like credit cards have been sanctioned. Employing the results from observatories to sight the monthly Crescent moon is today permitted and preferred by the clerics. In the medical field, various &quot;fatwas&quot; legalising novel procedures like corneal transplant, autopsies, organ donations, etc. have been issued. In marital and gender-related issues, divorce is encouraged for incompitable marriages. On the issues of birth control, abortions and family planning, the legal bodies are conservative and generally prohibit them, viewing them as a contrary to Qur&#x27;anic commandments and Islamic principles to raise Muslim population. However, family planning measures are permitted in certain scenarios, wherein the legal principles of necessity are applicable. The Board of Senior Ulema (BSU) stated in a 1976 &quot;fatwa&quot;:
== Jurisprudence ==
Wahhabi approach to &quot;Fiqh&quot; radically challenged prevalent conventions of school &quot;Taqlid&quot; and was based on Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s broader theological call for a return to the values of the &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot;. Of the four major sources in Sunni &quot;Fiqh&quot;the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, the &quot;Sunna&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Ijma&quot; (juristic consensus) and &quot;Qiyas&quot; (analogical reasoning)Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s writings emphasized the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Sunna&quot;. He used &quot;&#x27;ijma&quot; only &quot;in conjunction with its corroboration of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;hadith&quot;&quot; (and giving preference to the &quot;ijma&quot; of Muhammad&#x27;s companions rather than the &quot;ijma&quot; of legal specialists after his time), and &quot;qiyas&quot; only in cases of extreme necessity. He rejected deference to past juridical opinion (&quot;taqlid&quot;) in favor of independent reasoning (&quot;ijtihad&quot;), and opposed using local customs. He urged his followers to &quot;return to the primary sources&quot; of Islam in order &quot;to determine how the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and Muhammad dealt with specific situations&quot; without being beholden to the interpretations of previous Islamic scholarship, while engaging in &quot;Ijtihad&quot;.

Historically, many established figures from Hanbalite and Shafiite schools were noteworthy for their denunciation of &quot;taqlid&quot; since the classical period. Influenced by these scholars, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab, fervently denounced &quot;Taqlid&quot; and upheld that the Gates of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; remained open. According to Edward Mortimer, it was imitation of past judicial opinion in the face of clear contradictory evidence from &quot;hadith&quot; or &quot;Qur&#x27;anic&quot; text that Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab condemned. According to Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab and his followers, God&#x27;s commandments to obey Him alone and follow the Prophetic teachings, necessitated a complete adherence to &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;hadith&quot;. This entailed a rejection of all interpretations offered by the four legal schools – including the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot;&#x27;s own Hanbali school – wherein they contradict the two primary sources.

=== Perspective on other schools ===
Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab asserted that every Muslim layman, even one without modest educational credentials, have a duty to read and study the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and the &quot;Sunnah&quot;; encouraging them to research religious scriptures. Regional rivals castigated him as a self-taught &quot;ignorant&quot; since &quot;knowledge could come only from being taught by shaykhs&quot; and not by treating the Scriptures as one&#x27;s teacher. Although the issue of &quot;ijtihad&quot; and rejection of &quot;taqlid&quot; were central themes of his doctrines, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab did not lay down his approach to &quot;Usul-al Fiqh&quot; (Principles of Jurisprudence) comprehensively. Rather, that was left to his son-in-law and pupil Hamad ibn Nasir ibn Mu&#x27;ammar (), who would explicate a clarified Wahhabi position on &quot;Usul al-Fiqh&quot;, after Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab. Moreover, in his writings, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab relied primarily only on &quot;hadith&quot; (Prophetic traditions) rather than opinions of early Hanbali jurists. This stance arose uncertainty over his formal affiliation to the Hanbali &quot;mad&#x27;hab&quot; and would lead many local Hanbalite detractors to accuse him of undermining classical &quot;fiqh&quot; in general. Despite their conceptual doctrine based on repudiation of &quot;taqlid&quot; (emulating legal precedent) to a legal school and jettisoning the juristic super-structure that developed after the Islamic fourth century; in-order to lower clerical resistance to their campaign; Wahhabis sustained the local juristic tradition of Najd, which was based on Hanbalism.

According to an expert on law in Saudi Arabia (Frank Vogel), Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab himself &quot;produced no unprecedented opinions&quot;. The &quot;Wahhabis&#x27; bitter differences with other Muslims were not over &quot;fiqh&quot; rules at all, but over &quot;&#x27;aqida&quot;, or theological positions&quot;. Professor of history at Dickinson College, David Commins also states that early disputes with other Muslims did not center on &quot;fiqh&quot;, and that the belief that the distinctive character of Wahhabism stems from Hanbali legal thought is a &quot;myth&quot;. Some scholars are ambivalent as to whether Wahhabis belong to the Hanbali legal school. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World&quot; maintains Wahhabis &quot;rejected all jurisprudence that in their opinion did not adhere strictly to the letter of the Qur&#x27;an and the hadith&quot;. Cyril Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The New Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; states that &quot;strictly speaking&quot;, Wahhabis &quot;do not see themselves as belonging to any school&quot;, and that in doing so they correspond to the ideal aimed at by Ibn Hanbal, and thus they can be said to be of his &#x27;school&#x27;. According to DeLong-Bas, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab never directly claimed to be a Hanbali jurist, warned his followers about the dangers of adhering unquestionably to &quot;Fiqh&quot;, and did not consider &quot;the opinion of any law school to be binding&quot;. In the absence of a &quot;hadith&quot;, he encouraged following the examples of the companions of Muhammad rather than following a law school. He did, however, follow the Hanbali methodology of judging everything not explicitly forbidden to be permissible, avoiding the use of &quot;qiyas&quot; (analogical reasoning), and taking &quot;maslaha&quot; (public interest) and &quot;&#x27;adl&quot; (justice) into consideration.

=== Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar&#x27;s Legal Theory ===

While Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab himself was not inclined to adhere to a particular &quot;madhab&quot;, many of his followers would perpetuate the Hanbali legal theory. Hanbali jurist Hamad ibn Nasir ibn Mu&#x27;ammar (AH 1160–1125/ 1747–) laid out a comprehensive legal theory in his treatises like &quot;Risala al-Ijtihad wal Taqlid&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Ijtihad and Taqlid&quot;) which became influential in the scholarly circles of the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot;. Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar believed that maintaining the practice of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; in every era was a religious obligation and tasked the Islamic scholars for carrying out this responsibility. This was to be done through proof evaluation from the Scriptures and by employing &quot;Usul al-Fiqh&quot; (Principles of Jurisprudence). Based on one&#x27;s expertise and knowledge, Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar ranked a hierarchy of &quot;Fuqaha&quot; (Islamic jurists) for carrying out the duty of issuing &quot;fatwas&quot;. At the top was the absolute &quot;Mujtahid&quot; who issues verdicts solely based on the principles (&quot;Usul&quot;) of his madhab by independently determining the preponderant view from all the possible scenarios tracked down by himself as well as supplement the former rulings. After this came the 3 levels of partial &quot;Ijtihad&quot; which limited the scope of research: initially just to the past opinions, then to the rulings found in the 4 &quot;madhabs&quot; and finally to the views within one&#x27;s own &quot;madhab&quot;. The lowest of Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar&#x27;s hierarchy constituted the non-Mujtahid laity who are required to directly engage with the Scriptural sources in consultation with scholars, as well as by analysing past scholarly works. Thus, Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar&#x27;s legal theory strived for the reconciliation between the reformist programme of the &quot;Muwahhidin&quot; and the classical jurisprudential structures. What made Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar&#x27;s proposed system unique was its &quot;microcosmic&quot; and flexible nature; which permitted the scholars to simultaneously represent different ranks within the hierarchy to carry out their responsibilities of &quot;Ijtihad&quot;.

The Wahhabi legal theory stipulated proof-evaluation based on Hanbali principles as one of its major hallmarks. By claiming themselves as Hanbali, &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; scholars implied directly adhering to the five &quot;Usul al-Fiqh&quot; (Principles of jurisprudence) of the Hanbali school. Despite the main methodology of &quot;Wahhabi movement&quot; being derived from Hanbalite Ahl al-Hadith, scholars also take the rulings from other &quot;Madhhabs&quot;, as long they regard them as being verified through Hadith and traditions or Sunnah authenticated by Sahabah. (&quot;Qaul Sahabiyyah&quot; according to modern contemporary Muslim scholars). Prominent Wahhabi scholar Muhammad ibn Salih al-Uthaymeen derived rulings from the Shafiite jurisprudence in his commentary of The Meadows of the Righteous book authored by al-Nawawi, wherein the Ijtihad (reasoning) of Abu Hurairah was taken by al-Nawawi for rulings of Wudu (ablution ritual).

== Social reform ==

Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab concerned himself with the social reformation of his people. He stressed the importance of education, especially for females and encouraged women to be active in educational endeavours and lead various communal and social activities. Diriyah had become a major centre of learning and foreign travellers often noted the higher literacy rates of townsfolk of Central Arabia. In line with his methodology, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab also denounced the practice of instant &quot;triple talaq&quot;, counting it as only a single &quot;talaq&quot; (regardless of the number of pronouncements). The outlawing of &quot;triple talaq&quot; has been considered to be one of the most significant reforms in the Islamic World in the 20th and 21st centuries. As an 18th-century reformer, Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab advocated &quot;Ijtihad&quot; of qualified scholars in accordance with the teachings of &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadeeth&quot;. His thoughts reflected the major trends apparent in the 18th-century Islamic reform movements. Numerous significant socio-economic reforms would be advocated by the Imam during his lifetime. After his death, his followers continued his legacy. Notable jurists like Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar (AH 1160–1225/ 1747–) would issue ground-breaking &quot;fatwas&quot; (legal verdicts) on contemporary issues such as authorization of small-pox vaccinations; at a time when opposition to small-pox vaccinations was widespread among the scientific and political elites of Europe. Many women were influential in various reformist endeavours of the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot;; such as mass-education, communal activities, campaigns against superstitions, etc. These included Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s own daughter Fatimah, a revered Islamic scholar who travelled far and wide; and taught numerous men and women. However, future events such as the destruction of the Emirate of Diriyah in the Wahhabi Wars of 1818, subsequent persecution of Salafis and other Islamic reformers, etc. would result in a halt to the social reforms implemented by the Wahhabi jurists and their suspicions towards the outside world would linger throughout the 19th century.

With the resurgence of rising reform currents of &quot;Salafiyya&quot; across the Muslim world from the late 19th century, the Wahhabis of Najd too underwent a rejuvenation. After the establishment of the Third Saudi State and Unification of Saudi Arabia, a &quot;Salafiyya&quot; Global movement would crystallise with the backing of a state. Ibn Saud&#x27;s reforms would get criticism from zealots amongst some of his Wahhabi clergy-men; reminiscent of the 19th-century harshness. However, other &quot;ulema&quot; would allow them, eventually paving way for gradual reforms in KSA. Thus, new education policies would be approved that taught foreign languages, sciences, geography, etc. Overruling the objections of &quot;Ikhwan&quot;, the Wahhabi &quot;ulema&quot; would permit the introduction of telegraph and other wireless communication systems. Soon after, oil industries would be developed with the discovery of petroleum. Influential clerics such as Mufti Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Aal ash-Shaykh would endorse female education.

=== Politics ===
According to ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab; there are three objectives for Islamic government and society: &quot;to believe in Allah, enjoin good behavior, and forbid wrongdoing&quot;. This doctrine has been sustained in missionary literature, sermons, &quot;fatwa&quot; rulings, and explications of religious doctrine by Wahhabis since the death of ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab saw a role for the &quot;Imam&quot;, &quot;responsible for religious matters&quot;, and the &quot;Amir&quot;, &quot;in charge of political and military issues&quot;. Despite this, in Saudi history; the &quot;Imam&quot; had not been a religious preacher or scholar, but Muhammad ibn Saud and the subsequent Saudi dynastic rulers.

He also believed that the Muslim ruler is owed unquestioned allegiance as a religious obligation from his subjects; so long as he leads the community according to the laws of God (&quot;Shari&#x27;ah&quot;). A Muslim must present a &quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot; (oath of allegiance) to a Muslim ruler during his lifetime to ensure his redemption after death. Any counsel given to a ruler from community leaders or &quot;ulama&quot; should be private, not through public acts such as petitions, demonstrations, etc. This principle caused confusion during the dynastic disputes of the Second Saudi State during the late 19th-century, when rebels succeeded in overthrowing the monarch, to become ruler. While it gave the king a wide range of power, respecting &quot;shari&#x27;a&quot; does impose limits, such as giving &quot;qadi&quot; (Islamic judges) independence. This meant non-interference in their deliberations, as well as not codifying laws, following precedents or establishing a uniform system of law courtsboth of which violate the &quot;qadi&#x27;s&quot; independence.

Wahhabis have traditionally given their allegiance to the House of Saud, but a movement of &quot;Salafi jihadis&quot; has emerged in the contemporary among those who believe that Al-Saud has abandoned the laws of God. According to Zubair Qamar, while the &quot;standard view&quot; is that &quot;Wahhabis are apolitical and do not oppose the State&quot;, there is another &quot;strain&quot; of Wahhabism that &quot;found prominence among a group of Wahhabis after the fall of the second Saudi State in the 1800s&quot;, and post 9/11 is associated with Jordanian/Palestinian scholar Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi and &quot;Wahhabi scholars of the &#x27;Shu&#x27;aybi&#x27; school&quot;.

Wahhabis share the belief of Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Islamic dominion over politics and government and the importance of &quot;da&#x27;wah&quot; (proselytizing or preaching of Islam) not just towards non-Muslims but towards erroring Muslims. However Wahhabi preachers are conservative and do not deal with concepts such as social justice, anticolonialism, or economic equality, expounded upon by Islamist Muslims. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s original pact promised whoever championed his message, &#x27;will, by means of it, rule and lands and men&#x27;.&quot; While socio-political issues constituted a major aspect of his reformist programme, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab nonetheless didn&#x27;t advocate revolutionary overthrowal of the ruling order to establish a Caliphate across the Muslim world. Following the classical Sunni understanding, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab advocated accommodation with the status quo, stating:
18th and 19th century European travellers, ambassadors and writers considered the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; as championing an &quot;Islamic revolution&quot; that campaigned for a pristine Islam stripped of all complex rituals, cultural accretions, superstitions, etc. and a simpler creedal ethos based on universal brotherhood and fraternity; analogous to various European frondeurs during the Age of Revolutions. Contemporary European diplomats and observers who witnessed its emergence drew parallels with the American and French revolutions in Wahhabi opposition to Ottoman clerical hierarchy and foreign imperialism; with some even labelling them as &quot;Wahhabi Jacobins&quot; and its reformist efforts as a sort of &quot;Protestantism&quot;.

Cambridge historian Christopher Allen Bayly noted that the religious movement of the Arabian &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; also had a revolutionary political programme comparable to the European revolutions in the 18th and 19th centuries. The difference lied in their political language; wherein themes of anti-imperialism, opposition to foreign aggression, promotion of civic values, duties &amp; rights, etc. were conveyed to the local populace in terms of Islamic values. Tracing the movement&#x27;s popularity to the wider phenomenon of Ottoman decline, the far-reaching impacts of the French revolution on the Arab world; and deciphering the sudden collapse of its revolutionary Emirate to invasion by military despots of the old order; Bayly wrote:
== Prevalence ==

The Wahhabi movement, while predominant across Saudi Arabia, was established from the Najd region, and it is there that its conservative practices have the strongest support, more so than in regions in the kingdom to the east or west of it. Cyril Glasse credits the softening of some Wahhabi doctrines and practices outside of the Najd region on the conquest of the Hejaz region &quot;with its more cosmopolitan traditions and the traffic of pilgrims which the new rulers could not afford to alienate&quot;. Aside from Saudi Arabia, the only other country whose native population is predominantly Wahhabi is the adjacent gulf monarchy of Qatar. Estimates of the number of adherents to Wahhabism vary.

The &quot;boundaries&quot; of Wahhabism have been called &quot;difficult to pinpoint&quot;, but in contemporary usage, the terms &quot;&quot;Wahhabi&quot; and &quot;Salafi&quot;&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, and they are considered to be movements with different roots that have merged since the 1960s. However, Wahhabism is generally recognised as form of Salafism&quot;, contextualised as an ultra-conservative, Saudi brand of the wider movement. Muhammad Iqbal, praised the 18th-century Najdi movement as &quot;the first throb of life in modern Islam&quot;, and noted that its influence on 19th-century religious reformers was &quot;traceable, directly or indirectly [in] nearly all the great modern movements of Muslim Asia and Africa&quot;.

== Notable leaders ==
There has traditionally been a recognized head of the Wahhabi &quot;religious estate&quot;, often a member of Al ash-Sheikh (a descendant of Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab) or related to another religious head. For example, Abd al-Latif was the son of Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan.
* Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab (1703–1792) was the founder of the Wahhabi movement.
* &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab (1752–1826) was the head of Wahhabism after his father retired from public life in 1773. After the fall of the first Saudi emirate, Abd Allah went into exile in Cairo where he died.
* Sulayman ibn &#x27;Abd Allah (1780–1818) was a grandson of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and author of an influential treatise that restricted travel to and residing in land of idolaters.
* &#x27;Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan (1780–1869) was head of the religious estate in the second Saudi emirate.
* &#x27;Abd al-Latif ibn &#x27;Abd al-Rahman (1810–1876) Head of religious estate in 1860 and early 1870s.
* Abd Allah ibn Abd al-Latif Al ash-Sheikh (1848–1921) was the head of religious estate during period of Rashidi rule and the early years of King Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud.
* Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh (1893–1969) was the head of Wahhabism in mid twentieth century. He has been said to have &quot;dominated the Wahhabi religious estate and enjoyed unrivaled religious authority&quot;.
* Ghaliyya al-Wahhabiyya was a Bedouin woman from the town of Turubah who rose to the rank of &quot;Amira al-Umara&quot; (generalissimo) and led Wahhabi forces in defending Mecca during the Ottoman-Saudi Wars.
* &#x27;Abd al-Azeez ibn Baz (1910–1999) has been called &quot;the most prominent proponent&quot; of Wahhabism during his time.
* Muhammad ibn al-Uthaymeen (1925–2001) is another &quot;giant&quot;. According to David Dean Commins, no one &quot;has emerged&quot; with the same &quot;degree of authority in the Saudi religious establishment&quot; since their deaths.

== International influence and propagation ==

=== Explanation for influence ===

Khaled Abou El Fadl listed four major factors that contributed to expansion of Wahhabi ideas across the Islamic World:
* The appeal of Arab nationalism, which considered the Ottoman Empire to be a foreign occupying power and took a powerful precedent from the Wahhabi rebellion against the Ottomans
* Wahhabi calls for a return to the pristine Islam of the &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot; (righteous predecessors) which rejected much of the classical legal precedents; instead deriving directly from &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, &quot;Hadith&quot; and the sayings of the &quot;Salaf&quot;; through &quot;Ijtihad&quot;. This also appealed to the Islamic reformers who pushed for a revival of &quot;ijtihad&quot;, and a direct return to the original sources for interpreting the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Sunnah&quot;, to seek solutions to the present day problems.
* Control of Mecca and Medina, which allowed the King of Saudi Arabia to take the mantle of &quot;Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques&quot;. This enabled the Wahhabis to exert great influence on Islamic culture and thinking;
* Saudi Oil industry, especially after its boom during the 1970s energy crisis, allowed Saudi Arabia to successfully promote their interpretations of Islam throughout the Islamic World.

Peter Mandaville lists two more reasons:
* Societal factors: With the influx of modernity, younger generations of Muslims increasingly departed from the &quot;localized&quot; religious understanding of their parents and looked up to a pan-Islamic outlook authentically rooted in Scriptures and early generations of &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot;
* Rise of other native Islamic reformist movements such as the &quot;Ahl-e Hadith&quot; in South Asia and the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement in the Arab world which shared a common religious outlook. These movements expanded collaboration in various socio-economic, political and educational fields and formed a joint intellectual alliance. Additionally, influential conservative reform movements like Deobandism began co-operating with Wahhabis to a certain extent, despite doctrinal variations

According to French scholar and critic of Islamism Gilles Kepel, the tripling in the price of oil in the mid-1970s and the progressive takeover of Saudi Aramco in the 1974–1980 period, provided the source of much influence of Wahhabism in the Islamic World.

=== Funding ===
Estimates of Saudi spending on religious causes abroad include &quot;upward of $100billion&quot;; $2–3billion per year since 1975 (compared to the annual Soviet propaganda budget of $1billion/year); and &quot;at least $87billion&quot; from 1987 to 2007. Reliability of these rough estimates have been disputed due to their inconsistencies and lack of a scientific methodology for precise quantification.

Its largesse funded an estimated &quot;90% of the expenses of the entire faith&quot;, throughout the Muslim world, according to journalist Dawood al-Shirian. It extended to young and old, from children&#x27;s madrasas to high-level scholarship. &quot;Books, scholarships, fellowships, mosques&quot; (for example, &quot;more than 1,500 mosques were built from Saudi public funds over the last 50 years&quot;) were paid for. It rewarded journalists and academics, who followed it and built satellite campuses around Egypt for Al Azhar, the oldest and most influential Islamic university. Yahya Birt counts spending on &quot;1,500 mosques, 210 Islamic centres and dozens of Muslim academies and schools&quot;. Apart from state patronage, a major source of proselytization has been the private charities and religious activities of Muslim individuals and organizations.

This financial aid has done much to overwhelm less strict local interpretations of Islam, according to observers like Dawood al-Shirian and Lee Kuan Yew, arguing that it caused the Saudi interpretation (sometimes called &quot;petro-Islam&quot;) to be perceived as the correct interpretationor the &quot;gold standard&quot; of Islamin many Muslims&#x27; minds.

Peter Mandaville asserts that the commonly reported data estimates regarding Saudi religious funding are unreliable due to the sources being &quot;internally inconsistent&quot; and based on &quot;non-specific hearsay&quot;. According to Mandaville, the wide-ranging and controversial usage of the term &quot;Wahhabism&quot; has rendered researching Saudi religious transnationalism and assessing its actual magnitude even more confusing. Moreover, the post-Cold War era governments had commonly used the label &quot;Wahhabism&quot; to designate a wide swathe of religious sects, including those which were doctrinally at odds with Wahhabism.

=== Militant and political Islam ===
Allegations of links between Wahhabism proper and the ideology of militant Islamists such as al-Qaeda and Islamic State, have been disputed. Throughout the 20th century Board of Senior Ulema (BSU) of the &quot;Dar al-Ifta&quot; in Saudi Arabia, were known for issuing &quot;fatawa&quot; which strongly condemned various forms of war crimes and terrorism, in line with Islamic military jurisprudence. In a well-known &quot;fatwa&quot; issued at its 32nd session in Ta&#x27;if on 25 August 1988, the board members recommended the death penalty for acts of terrorism. Moreover, the Wahhabi &quot;ulema&quot; of Saudi Arabia had ruled the illegality of all forms of suicide bombings, including in Israel. The doctrine of suicide bombings which started appearing in the manuals of various Egyptian extremists during the 1970s and 1980s; has been rejected as heretical by the Wahhabi scholars. Jonathan Sozek reports that while Bin Laden self-identified as a Salafist, he was not affiliated with the Wahhabi movement.

The Yemeni origins of the Bin Laden family also reflected a non-Wahhabi heritage. Bin Laden&#x27;s feud with the Saudi government intensified during the Gulf War; prompting Saudi authorities to place Bin Laden under house arrest in 1991, before exiling him the same year. In 1994, Saudi Arabia revoked Bin Laden&#x27;s citizenship and froze all his assets, turning him into a fugitive and the Bin Laden family disowned him. After Saudi pressure on Sudan, the Al-Qaeda leader sought refuge under the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Taliban&#x27;s denial of Saudi requests to extradite Bin Laden led to a diplomatic row between Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. Throughout the 1990s, mainstream Wahhabi clerics in the Kingdom supported US-Saudi alliance against Ba&#x27;athist Iraq during the Gulf War and condemned terrorist acts by Al-Qaeda. Anti-establishment Wahhabi scholars have also been vehemently opposed to tactics advocated by Bin Laden, not withstanding their opposition to American foreign policy in West Asia. Scholars like Professor F. Gregory Gause have strongly opposed hysterical assertions made by war hawks in the Bush administration, contrasting their portrayals of Wahhabism with attempts made by far-right militants to appropriate American patriotism.

== Contemporary discourse ==
In contemporary discourse, the post-Soviet states widely employ the term &quot;Wahhabism&quot; to denote any manifestation of Islamic assertion in neighbouring Muslim countries. During the Soviet-era, the Muslim dissidents were usually labelled with terms such as &quot;Sufi&quot; and &quot;fanatic&quot; employing Islamophobic discourses that aroused hysteria of an underground religious activists threatening the stability of the Marxist order. By the late 1990s, the &quot;Wahhabi&quot; label would become the most common term to refer to the alleged &quot;Islamic menace&quot; in state propaganda, while &quot;Sufism&quot; was invoked as a &quot;moderate&quot; force that balanced the &quot;radicalism&quot; of those who were being accused as &quot;Wahhabis&quot;. The old-guard of the post-Soviet states found the label useful to depict all opposition as extremists, thereby bolstering their &#x27;strongman&#x27; credentials. In short, any Muslim critical of the religious or political status quo, came at risk of being labelled &quot;Wahhabi&quot;.

According to M. Reza Pirbhai, Associate Professor of History at Georgetown University, notions of a &quot;Wahhabi conspiracy&quot; against the West have in recent times resurfaced in various sections of the Western media; employing the term as a catch-all phrase to frame an official narrative that erases the concerns of broad and disparate disenchanted groups pursuing redress for local discontentment caused by neo-colonialism. The earliest mention of &quot;Wahhabism&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; had appeared in a 1931 editorial which described it as a &quot;traditional&quot; movement; without associating it with &quot;militant&quot; or &quot;anti-Western&quot; trends. Between 1931 and 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published eighty-six articles that mentioned the word &quot;Wahhabism&quot;, out of which six articles had appeared before September 2001, while the rest were published since. During the 1990s, it began to be described as &quot;militant&quot;, but not yet as a hostile force. By the 2000s, the 19th century terminology of &quot;Wahhabism&quot; had resurfaced, reprising its role as the &quot; &#x27;fanatical&#x27; and &#x27;despotic&#x27; antithesis of a civilized world. Reza Pirbhai asserts that this use is deployed to manufacture an official narrative that assists imperial purposes by depicting a coherent and coordinated international network of ideological revolutionaries. Common neo-liberal depictions of &quot;Wahhabism&quot; define it as a collection of restrictive dogmas, particularly for women, while neo-conservative depictions portray &quot;Wahhabis&quot; as &quot;savages&quot; or &quot;fanatics&quot;.

== Criticism and support ==
=== Criticism by other Muslims ===

Among the criticism, or comments made by critics, of the Wahhabi movement are:
* That it is not so much strict and uncompromising as aberrant, going beyond the bounds of Islam in its restricted definition of &quot;&quot; (Islamic monotheistic tenets), and much too willing to commit (Excommunicate) Muslims found in violation of Wahhabi doctrines. According to some sources, during the second Wahhabi-Saudi conquest of the Arabian Peninsula, an estimated 400,000 were killed or wounded according to some estimates. However, the validity of the 400,000 casualty count is contentious and seen as an exaggerated figure by many scholars, who trace it as a fabrication that emerged during the 1990s. More reliable tallies estimate the number of killed and wounded somewhere between 10,000 and 25,000.
* That the Wahhabi stances that reject (imitation of juristic precedent) and advocate opening of (independent legal judgement) would result in the formulation of various ideological pretensions that could &quot;erode the very essence of Islam&quot;. Sufi traditionalists strongly emphasize the necessity of taqlid to the four major (legal schools) and invoke the teachings and legacy of its founders to defend the &quot;madhhab&quot;-based legal system.
* That Muhammad bin Saud&#x27;s agreement to wage jihad to spread Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s teachings had more to do with traditional Najdi practice of raiding&quot;instinctive fight for survival and appetite for lucre&quot;than with religion;
* That its rejection of the &quot;orthodox&quot; belief in saints, a belief which had become a cardinal doctrine in Sunni Islam very early on, represents a departure from something which has been an &quot;integral part of Islam... for over a millennium.&quot;

=== Initial criticism ===
It has been reported that Ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s father was critical of his son. The dispute arose when Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab began his public &quot;da&#x27;wa&quot; activities in Huraymila. However, none of the sources state the exact nature of this disagreement. Salafi scholar al-Uthaymin noted that it probably was not concerning an issue of &quot;&#x27;Aqidah&quot; (beliefs) as Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab, &quot;did not lend any support to the saint-cults and other false practices&quot;. It is speculated that they disputed over payment of judges in solving disputes and in the manner of giving &quot;da&#x27;wa&quot;, spreading Islamic teachings. Until his father&#x27;s death in AH 1153; Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab was not overly active and public in his &quot;da&#x27;wah&quot; efforts.

Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s brother allegedly wrote a book in refutation of his brother&#x27;s new teachings, called: &quot;The Final Word from the Qur&#x27;an, the Hadith, and the Sayings of the Scholars Concerning the School of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&quot;, also known as:
&quot;Al-Sawa`iq al-Ilahiyya fi Madhhab al-Wahhabiyya&quot; (&quot;The Divine Thunderbolts Concerning the Wahhabi School&quot;). It has been reported that his brother repented and eventually returned to his call.

In &quot;The Refutation of Wahhabism in Arabic Sources, 1745–1932&quot;, Hamadi Redissi provides original references to the description of Wahhabis as a divisive sect (&quot;firqa&quot;) and outliers (&quot;Kharijites&quot;) in communications between Ottomans and Egyptian Khedive Muhammad Ali. Redissi details refutations of Wahhabis by scholars (muftis); among them Ahmed Barakat Tandatawin, who in 1743 describes Wahhabism as ignorance (&quot;Jahala&quot;).

==== Sunni criticism ====
Turkish columnist Ekrem Buğra Ekinci wrote an article in the pro-AKP newspaper &quot;Daily Sabah&quot;, in which he argued against classifying Wahhabism as part of Sunnism. According to British writer Simon Ross Valentine, Wahhabism has been vehemently criticized by many Sunni Muslims and some Islamic scholars in the strongest terms as a &quot;new faction, a vile sect&quot;.

In the 18th century, prominent Ottoman Hanafi scholar Ibn Abidin declared the Wahhabi movement of Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab to be a modern-day manifestation of the Kharijites. He said:

The followers of Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab considered the ideas of the Hanbali theologian Ahmad Ibn Taymiyya () highly attractive and made him their central classical scholarly reference. However, for centuries Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s thoughts were mostly ignored by those who constituted the scholarly mainstream; who would accuse the Wahhabis for overemphasizing the scholarly works of Ibn Taymiyya. It was only during the 19th century that Ibn Taymiyya came to exercise prominent scholarly influence over Muslim youth and by the 20th century he would be a major reference for Islamic revolutionaries. On the other hand, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab would deny that he had bias towards Ibn Taymiyya; and states in &quot;Hadiyya al-Thaniyya&quot;:

Another early rebuttal of Wahhabism came from the Sunni Sufi jurist Ibn Jirjis, who argued that supplicating the saints is permitted to whoever &quot;declares that there is no god but God and prays toward Mecca&quot; for, according to him, supplicating the saints is not a form of worship but merely calling out to them, and that worship at graves is not idolatry unless the supplicant believes that buried saints have the power to determine the course of events. These arguments were specifically rejected as heretical by the Wahhabi leader at the time.

===== Turkey =====
The leader of the Gulen movement, Fethullah Gülen accuses Arabs of conspiring against the Ottoman Empire as well as reducing Islam strictly to Wahhabism and Arab norms.

===== South Asia =====
Opposition to Wahhabism emerged in South Asia during the early 19th century; which was led by prominent Islamic scholar and theologian Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi (1796–1861). By the late 19th century, the anti-Wahhabi campaign in South Asia was led by Ahmed Raza Khan (1856–1921) and his disciples, who engaged in extensive written refutations and polemics against Wahhabism. His movement became known as the Barelvi movement and was defined by rejection of Wahhabi beliefs.

===== Lebanon =====
The transnational Lebanon-based Al-Ahbash movement uses takfir against Wahhabi and Salafi leaders. The head of Al-Ahbash, Abdullah al-Harari accuses Wahhabis of falling into anthropomorphic descriptions of God and imitating polytheists.

===== United States =====
The Sufi Islamic Supreme Council of America founded by the Naqshbandi Sufi Shaykh Hisham Kabbani condemn Wahhabism as &quot;extremist&quot; and &quot;heretical&quot;; accusing it of being a terrorist ideology that labels other Muslims, especially Sufis as polytheists, a practice known as takfir.

=== Non-religious motivations ===
According to French Political Scientist Gilles Kepel, the alliance between Ibn &#x27;Abd-al Wahhab and the tribal chief Muhammad ibn Saud to wage &quot;jihad&quot; on neighboring allegedly ignorant Muslims, was a &quot;consecration&quot; by Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab since he renamed the Saudi tribe&#x27;s long-standing raids as Jihad. Part of the Najd&#x27;s &quot;Hobbesian state of perpetual war pitted Bedouin tribes against one another for control of the scarce resources that could stave off starvation.&quot; And a case of substituting &quot;fath&quot;, &quot;the &#x27;opening&#x27; or conquest of a vast territory through religious zeal&quot;, for the &quot;instinctive fight for survival and appetite for lucre&quot;.

=== Support ===
Pakistani poet Muhammad Iqbal praised the movement as an influential endeavour of Islamic Golden Age that campaigned to put an end to the general stagnation of Muslims, while saying that:
Islamic scholar Bilal Philips asserted that the charge of &quot;Wahhabi&quot; was deployed by the proponents of &quot;Madh&#x27;hab&quot; fanaticism during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to &quot;Takfir&quot; (excommunicate) the legal non-conformists. According to Philips:
Syrian-Egyptian Islamic revivalist scholar Muhammad Rashid Rida was one of the most influential supporters of the Wahhabi movement during the 20th century. Rida had developed favourable views towards the Wahhabis as early as his arrival in Egypt during the 1890s; after reading about the movement in the histories of Al-Jabartī and Al-Nāṣiri. Rida asserted that the social and military expansion of the Wahhabi movement could successfully launch an authentic Islamic revival throughout the Islamic World. Rida believed that the decline of Muslims was a result of the stagnation caused by the excesses of Sufism; which had distorted the pristine message of Islam. As a leading figure of the Salafiyya movement, Rida launched his project of re-habilitating Wahhabism and would popularise Najdi scholarly treatises across the Muslim World through his &quot;Al-Manar&quot; printing press.

Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia, had openly expressed his view in his book , that the progressive &quot;Tajdid&quot; movement by Wahhabis was essentially a positive influence on Islam globally, particularly in developing nations struggling to gain independence. Sukarno also appreciated the &quot;wisdom of Ibn Saud to support Wahhabi scholars in their effort to reject various one thousand one kind of Bidʻah&quot;. It is argued by some that Sukarno was also influenced by Islamist figures such as Ahmad Khatib al-Minangkabawi, Agus Salim, and particularly Hamka, his elementary teacher.

According to notable Arab Linguist Taha Hussein (1889–), the Wahhabi movement was new, yet simultaneously old. Although it was novel for its contemporary generations, it was also ancient in its powerful calls for return to a pure Islam untainted by the impurities of &quot;Shirk&quot; (polytheism). Acclaiming its role in the Arab Awakening and intellectual renewal, Taha Hussein states:

<doc id="159042" wikidata="Q1025504" url="?curid=159042" title="Cafe Au Go Go">
<text>The Cafe Au Go Go was a Greenwich Village night club located in the basement of the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre building in the late 1960s, and located at 152 Bleecker Street in Manhattan, New York City. The club featured many musical groups, folk singers and comedy acts between the opening in February 1964 until closing in December 1970. The club was originally owned by Howard Solomon who sold it in June 1969 to Moses Baruch. Howard Solomon became the manager of singer Fred Neil.

==History==
The club was the first New York City venue for the Grateful Dead. Richie Havens and the Blues Project were weekly regulars as well as Harvey Brooks who was bass player in residence, The Stone Poneys featuring Linda Ronstadt played frequently. The Grateful Dead played 10 times in 1967 and 3 in 1969. Jimi Hendrix sat in with blues harp player James Cotton there in 1968.

Van Morrison, Tim Hardin, Tim Buckley, Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Oscar Brown Jr., the Youngbloods, the Siegel-Schwall Band, John Hammond Jr., The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, The Clear Light, Michael Bloomfield, Jefferson Airplane, Cream, The Chambers Brothers, Canned Heat, The Fugs, Odetta, Country Joe and the Fish, The Yardbirds, The Doors all played there.

Blues legends Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Son House, Skip James, Bukka White, and Big Joe Williams performed at the club after being &quot;rediscovered&quot; in the &#x27;60s. Before many rock groups began performing there, the Au Go Go was an oasis for jazz (Bill Evans, Stan Getz), comedy (Lenny Bruce, George Carlin) and folk music.

When the club was sold in 1969 it closed for over a month for renovations including upgrades to the kitchen and a new sound system installed by a then-local audio engineer Kenny D&#x27;Alessandro. Van Morrison was the first artist to play at the re-opened club in August 1969, having just released his album Astral Weeks.

===Au Go Go Singers and comedians===

In 1964, Solomon brought in a large group of singers and musicians from an off-Broadway show and christened them the Au Go Go Singers, to rival the Bitter End Singers across the street at The Bitter End Cafe. Solomon managed the group until their breakup in late 1965.

The Au Go Go Singers included Kathy King (who later toured with Bobby Vinton and appeared in the Broadway show &quot;Oh Calcutta&quot; and currently works as Kathrin King Segal), Jean Gurney, Michael Scott (who later performed with the Highwaymen and the Serendipity Singers), Rick (Frederic) Geiger (who eventually was accepted into a light opera company in California), Roy Michaels (who later performed with Cat Mother &amp; the All Night Newsboys and toured with Jimi Hendrix), Nels Gustafson, Bob Harmelink, and soloists Stephen Stills and Richie Furay. (Gustafson and Harmelink had been in an earlier trio with Furay, but quit show business after the demise of the Au Go Go Singers.)

It was also at the Cafe Au Go Go that a new folk/rock group, The Company, was formed from some remnants of the Au Go Go Singers: Geiger, Michaels, Scott &amp; Gurney (who together before the Au Go Go Singers performed as the Bay Singers, a popular group in Boston &amp; New York City), and Stills. Immediately after the Au Go Go Singers breakup, the Rollins and Joffe Talent Agency—managers of Dick Cavett, Woody Allen, and other notables—heard a reunion of the Bay Singers at the Cafe Au Go Go and offered the group a six-week Canadian tour. Rollins and Joffe did not originally include Stills on the tour, but Stills made it known to the Bay Singers that he wanted to join their group and the tour.

Very comfortable in performing their arrangements and songs they perfected on their radio show and performances before joining the Au Go Go Singers, and knowing that Jack Rollins and Charlie Joffe offered the tour based on the Singers&#x27; performance, most of the Bay Singers were hesitant to add another member, but ultimately gave in to Stills. The new quintet switched to amplified instruments, took about a week to learn new material (some under the direction of the former Au Go Go Singers arranger, Jim Friedman), named their new group The Company, and then headed for Ontario. While on tour the group first met Neil Young, who was performing with the Squires, as the opening act for The Company. After leaving Canada The Company played at Mr. Kelly&#x27;s in Chicago where Woody Allen was headlining. In less than a year after the group broke up, Stills, Young, Richie Furay, and two others formed Buffalo Springfield.

===Comedians and Lenny Bruce arrests===
Howard Solomon not only had The Au Go Go Singers, but had also booked comedians such as George Carlin and Lenny Bruce, who had regular stints at Cafe Au Go Go that would last either from one or two days to three weeks. Lenny Bruce&#x27;s performances at the Go Go were controversial. In April 1964, Bruce appeared twice at the Cafe Au Go Go with undercover police detectives in the audience. On both occasions, he was arrested after leaving the stage, the complaints pertaining to his use of various obscenities. Club owner Howard Solomon was arrested too.

A three-judge panel presided over the widely publicized six-month trial, with Bruce and club owner Howard Solomon both found guilty of obscenity on November 4, 1964. The conviction was announced despite positive testimony and petitions of support from Woody Allen, Bob Dylan, Jules Feiffer, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, William Styron, and James Baldwin – among other artists, writers and educators, and from Manhattan journalist and television personality Dorothy Kilgallen and sociologist Herbert Gans. Bruce was sentenced, on December 21, 1964, to four months in the workhouse. He was set free on bail during the appeals process and died before the appeal was decided. Solomon later saw his conviction overturned.

By 1966, the police and the courts had managed to silence Lenny Bruce and taught him a lesson that he should not use &quot;foul language&quot; or show disrespect for the church and the law. Eventually bankrupting him just before his death that year. Though the police had managed to silence Lenny Bruce, George Carlin continued to do his controversial comedy. Carlin eventually went on to have his own trouble with the law. Controversy arose because of the use of obscenities in his counter-culture routine known at the &quot;Seven Dirty Words&quot;. Both Lenny Bruce and George Carlin were two of the most influential stand-up comedians of their time and they along with many others had come out of the Cafe Au Go Go.

On December 23, 2003, 37 years after his death, Bruce was granted a posthumous pardon for his obscenity conviction by New York Governor George Pataki, following a petition filed by Ronald Collins and David Skover with Robert Corn-Revere as counsel, the petition having been signed by several stars such as Robin Williams. It was the first posthumous pardon in the state&#x27;s history. Pataki said his act was &quot;a declaration of New York&#x27;s commitment to upholding the First Amendment.&quot;

When the Cafe au Go Go closed, the now-famous Stephen Stills was a featured performer at the gala closing.

==Current use==

<text>&quot;Beatlesque&quot; () or &quot;Beatles-esque&quot; describes a musical resemblance to the English rock band the Beatles. The term is loosely defined and has been applied inconsistently to a wide variety of disparate artists.

==Definitions==
To better explain what the word might mean, eight possible answers were formulated by radio producer Kevin Howlett, music professor Rob Bowman, and Klaatu drummer Terry Draper:
* &quot;Penny Lane&quot;-style piano tone clusters (also heard on &quot;Getting Better&quot; and &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;)
* &quot;the big ending&quot;, as in &quot;It&#x27;s All Too Much&quot;
* bluegrass-influenced close harmonies, using fourth intervals
* &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;-inspired cellos
* the stylistic contrast between Lennon and McCartney
* the left-handed, right-handed drumming; referencing Ringo Starr&#x27;s habit of playing right-handed drum kits despite being left-handed
* when audiences feel that the band is a continuation of the Beatles, as was the case for Klaatu
* a simulacrum of the Beatles&#x27; reputed sound that ultimately means nothing (&quot;a copy without an original&quot;).

The &quot;Toronto Star&quot;″s Jack Sakamoto has commented: &quot;[Some people&#x27;s] notion of that sound includes everyone from Panic! at the Disco to Billy Joel to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. With those reference points, it&#x27;s debatable whether the Beatles themselves would qualify for the adjective their music has spawned.&quot; &quot;Culture Sonar&quot;″s Scott Freiman argued that anyone who is &quot;Beatlesque&quot; has &quot;got to be a band – not just a singer/songwriter with a backing band ... [but having] multiple songwriters and multiple vocalists&quot;.

Writing in 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Rob Sheffield identified Paul McCartney as the Beatle whose character best fitted the term &quot;Beatlesque&quot;, adding: &quot;If you dislike the Beatles, it&#x27;s because you dislike Paul. If you love them despite their flaws, you mean Paul&#x27;s flaws ...&quot;

==Associated artists==
Notable acts described as &quot;Beatlesque&quot;


*Badfinger – The first artists to sign with the Beatles&#x27; Apple Records. Their songs &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (1969), &quot;No Matter What&quot; (1970) and &quot;Day After Day&quot; (1971) were produced by McCartney, Beatles road manager Mal Evans, and George Harrison, respectively.
*Big Star – Although the American band attracted critical acclaim for its Beatles-influenced work in the 1970s, its life proved contentious and short. They earned critical acclaim and a cult following despite the lack of commercial success.
*The Byrds – Sometimes regarded as the &quot;American Beatles&quot;. While their long-term influence has proven to be comparable to that of the Beatles in terms of sound and style, the Byrds failed to match their contemporaries&#x27; record sales.
*Cheap Trick – Also sometimes known as the &quot;American Beatles&quot;. In addition, the group&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;All Shook Up&quot; was produced by longtime Beatles producer George Martin, and the group&#x27;s live performance of Beatles songs culminated with a full orchestra-backed live album, titled &quot;Sgt. Pepper Live&quot; (2009).
*Electric Light Orchestra – Formed explicitly with the intention of &quot;picking up where the Beatles left off&quot;, the outfit has proved one of the few Beatlesque groups to achieve sustained commercial success. In addition, frontman Jeff Lynne began a musical collaboration with George Harrison in the late 1980s that led to him working on several projects related to the Beatles. In the early 1970s, John Lennon praised ELO as &quot;sons of Beatles&quot; and cited their 1973 song &quot;Showdown&quot; as a personal favourite.
*Elephant 6 – Not a band, but a collective of them. The collective is famously inspired by psychedelic pop of the 1960s, including the Beatles and The Beach Boys, with bands like The Apples In Stereo and Of Montreal gathering comparisons to the Beatles.
*Harry Nilsson – During a 1968 press conference, the Beatles were asked what their favorite American group was and answered &quot;Nilsson&quot;. Sometimes known as &quot;The American Beatle&quot;, he was close friends with both John Lennon and Ringo Starr.
*Klaatu – Falsely rumoured to be the Beatles themselves, re-formed. The band are sometimes known as the &quot;Canadian Beatles&quot;.
*Oasis – Their Beatles influence was labelled as an &quot;obsession&quot; by British media. During their 1991 to 2009 career, the band&#x27;s widespread success in terms of culture and social reach caused it to be possibly the most popular band since the Beatles.
*Squeeze – The British band&#x27;s songwriting pair of Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook has attracted comparisons to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. Both Difford and Tilbrook have acknowledged the influence of the comparison on the band&#x27;s catalogue.

<doc id="159046" wikidata="Q5548580" url="?curid=159046" title="Geothermal desalination">
<text>Geothermal desalination refers to the process of using geothermal energy to power the process of converting salt water to fresh water. The process is considered economically efficient, and while overall environmental impact is uncertain, it has potential to be more environmentally friendly compared to conventional desalination options. Geothermal desalination plants have already been successful in various regions, and there is potential for further development to allow the process to be used in an increased number of water scarce regions.

== Process explanation ==
Desalination is the process of removing minerals from seawater to convert it into fresh water. Desalination is divided into two categories in terms of processes: processes driven by thermal energy and processes driven by mechanical energy. Geothermal desalination uses geothermal energy as the thermal energy source to drive the desalination process.

There are two types of geothermal desalination: direct and indirect. Direct geothermal desalination heats seawater to boiling in an evaporator, then transferring to a condenser. In contrast, indirect geothermal desalination converts geothermal energy into electricity which is then used for membrane desalination. If the geothermal energy is used indirectly, it can be used to generate power for the water desalination process, as well as excess electricity that can be used for consumers. Similarly, if the geothermal energy is used directly, the excess geothermal energy can be used to drive heating and cooling processes.

== Applications ==

=== Current ===
One use of geothermal desalination is in producing fresh water for agriculture. One example of agricultural applications of geothermal energy is the Balcova-Naridere Geothermal Field (BNGF) in Turkey. However, arsenic and boron, two potentially toxic elements, have been found in the geothermal water used to generate electricity. Since the construction of the geothermal desalination plant in this region, these toxic elements have contaminated freshwater wells, rendering this water unusable for agriculture. Due to the increase in contamination in the surrounding environment, this project is not considered a success.

Another use of geothermal desalination is the production of drinking water, as shown by the Milos Island Project in Greece, which relied entirely on geothermal energy to produce desalinated water. This plant was constructed because geothermal energy is readily available in this region, as Milos Island is located in a volcanic region, which makes using geothermal energy a viable way to power the desalination of salt water. The Milos Island plant utilizes a combination of direct and indirect desalination. Unlike the BNGF project, this is considered a success as it produced drinkable water without polluting the environment at a low cost using only geothermal energy.

=== Future potential ===
Research indicates geothermal desalination can be implemented in some regions with water scarcity, as it is a relatively low cost solution to increasing available fresh water. In particular, two regions that have ample geothermal resources and are experiencing water scarcity are California and Saudi Arabia. Because these regions already have existing desalination plants, implementation of geothermal desalination plants would be relatively easy.

Furthermore, as the technology for producing geothermal energy improves, geothermal desalination will become possible in more regions. Technologies that are currently being developed will allow the geothermal water used to produce energy to be the water that becomes desalinated. This will allow regions that are not close to an ocean to perform geothermal desalination, which will widely expand the potential for regions to perform geothermal desalination.
== Environmental impacts ==
Much of the environmental impact in the geothermal desalination process stems from the use of geothermal energy, not from the desalination process itself. Geothermal desalination has both environmental benefits and drawbacks. One benefit is that geothermal energy is a renewable resource and emits fewer greenhouse gasses than non-renewable energy sources. Another benefit to the environment is that geothermal energy has a smaller land footprint compared to wind or solar energy. More specifically, the land usage required for geothermal desalination site has been estimated to be 1.2 to 2.7 square terameters are required for each megawatt of energy produced.

One environmental drawback is due to geothermal desalination being an energy intensive process; the energy consumption ranges from about 4 to 27 kWh per square meter of the desalination plant. Moreover, some researchers are concerned that due to lack of regulation on carbon dioxide () emissions from geothermal plants, particularly in the United States, there are significant detrimental emissions from these plants that are not being measured. Geothermal power has been found to leak toxic elements such as mercury, boron, and arsenic into the environment, meaning geothermal desalination plants are a potential health hazard for their surrounding environment. Ultimately though, the long term environmental consequences of geothermal power desalination plants are still not clear.

== Economic factors ==
Geothermal energy is not dependent on day or night cycles and weather conditions, meaning it has a high-capacity factor, which is a measure of how often a plant is running at maximum power. This provides a stable and reliable energy supply. This also means that geothermal desalination plants can operate in any weather condition at any time of day. In terms of capacity, the United States, Indonesia, Philippines, Turkey, New Zealand, and Mexico accounted for 75% of the global geothermal energy capacity. It would be the most economically feasible to perform geothermal desalination in these countries due to their geothermal energy capacity.

For membrane desalination specifically, using geothermal energy reduces cost compared to using other energy sources. This is because geothermal power is traditionally produced at a competitive cost compared to other energy sources including fossil fuels; a 2011 study estimates the cost to be $0.10/kWh. Specifically, the US Department of Energy has estimated that geothermal desalination can produce desalinated water at a cost of $1.50 per cubic meter of desalinated water.

== History ==
The exact origins of geothermal desalination are unclear; however some early work is credited to Leon Awerbuch, a scientist working in Research &amp; Development at the Bechtel Group at the time, who proposed the process of using geothermal energy for water desalination in 1972. In 1994, a prototype that used geothermal energy to power desalination was built by Caldor-Marseille. This prototype was able to produce a few cubic meters of desalinated water per day. In 1995, a geothermal desalination prototype plant was built in Tunisia, which is one of the earliest documented cases of a geothermal desalination plant. Its capacity was three cubic meters of water per day, which could meet the needs of the surrounding communities. The cost of water was estimated to be $1.20 per cubic meter.

<text>Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal is a 2001 book by Eric Schlosser. First serialized by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1999, the book has drawn comparisons to Upton Sinclair&#x27;s 1906 muckraking novel &quot;The Jungle&quot;. The book was adapted into a 2006 film of the same name, directed by Richard Linklater.

== Background ==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; asked Schlosser to write an article looking at America through fast food in 1997 after reading his article on migrants in &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. He then spent nearly three years researching the fast-food industry, from the slaughterhouses and packing plants that turn out the burgers to the minimum-wage workers who cook them to the television commercials that entice children to eat them with the lure of cheap toys and colorful playgrounds. The experience enraged and appalled him.

==Summary==
The book is divided into two sections: &quot;The American Way&quot; and &quot;Meat and Potatoes&quot;. &quot;The American Way&quot; the first part, takes a historical view of the fast food business by analyzing its beginnings within post-World War II America while &quot;Meat and Potatoes&quot; examines the specific mechanisms of the fast-food industry within a modern context as well as its influence.

=== &quot;The American Way&quot; ===
The first section of &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; opens with a discussion of Carl N. Karcher and the McDonald brothers, examining their roles as pioneers of the fast-food industry in southern California. This discussion is followed by an examination of Ray Kroc and Walt Disney&#x27;s complicated relationship before ending with the consideration of the intricate, profitable methods of advertising to children. Next, Schlosser visits Colorado Springs, CO and investigates the life and working conditions of the typical fast-food industry employee, learning how fast-food restaurants pay minimum wage to a higher proportion of their employees than any other American industry.

=== &quot;Meat and Potatoes&quot; ===
The second section of the text begins with a discussion of the chemical components that make the food taste so good. Schlosser follows this with a discussion of the life of a typical rancher, considering the difficulties presented to the agricultural world in a new economy. Schlosser analyzes the meatpacking industry, which he tags as the most dangerous job in America. Moreover, the meat produced by slaughterhouses has become increasingly more hazardous since the centralization of the industry due to the way cattle are raised, slaughtered, and processed, providing an ideal setting for E coli to spread. Additionally, working conditions continue to grow worse. In the final chapter, Schlosser considers how fast food has matured as an American cultural export following the Cold War and how the collapse of Soviet Communism allowed the mass spread of American goods and services, especially fast food. As a result, the rest of the world is catching up with America&#x27;s rising obesity rates.

===&quot;Afterword&quot;===
In the 2012 edition, Schlosser published a revised edition that included an afterword. In the afterword, he looks back at the relevance and criticism of the first edition and how it inspired other works as well as how the fast food industry has evolved in the ten years following the book, including its effects on policy and childhood obesity rates. He concluded that, given the swift, decisive and effective action that took place as a result of this interest and intervention, many of the problems documented in the book are solvable, given enough political will. The afterword can also be read in an article penned by Schlosser at &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;.

==Reception==
Rob Walker, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, remarks that &quot;Schlosser is a serious and diligent reporter&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; isn&#x27;t an airy deconstruction but an avalanche of facts and observations as he examines the fast-food process from meat to marketing.&quot; Walker however does raise concerns about the data on which Schlosser bases his claims. For example, Schlosser suggests that hundreds have died from E. coli infections as a result of eating fast food. However, as Walker points out, “[Schlosser] extrapolated his figures from an annual total in a report on food-related illness, which itself relied on a good deal of extrapolation. Moreover, that report doesn&#x27;t address fast food specifically (and in fact Schlosser builds his numbers from figures including E. coli cases that are not even food-borne), which is relevant because fast-food outlets are hardly the only places where processed meat is sold.&quot;

Julia Livshin, writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, believes &quot;Schlosser&#x27;s book is not just a compendium of kitchen horror stories. In clean, sober prose packed with facts, he strips away the carefully crafted feel-good veneer of fast food and shows how the industry&#x27;s astounding success has been achieved, and is sustained, at an equally astounding cost—to the nation&#x27;s health, environment, economy, and culture.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;While cataloguing assorted evils with the tenacity and sharp eye of the best investigative journalist, [Schlosser] uncovers a cynical, dismissive attitude to food safety in the fast food industry and widespread circumvention of the government&#x27;s efforts at regulation enacted after Upton Sinclair&#x27;s similarly scathing novel exposed the meat-packing industry 100 years ago. By systematically dismantling the industry&#x27;s various aspects, Schlosser establishes a seminal argument for true wrongs at the core of modern America.&quot;

The book won the 2002 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Nonfiction.

=== Industry response ===
Terrie Dort, president of the National Council of Chain Restaurants, the trade association representing many of the country&#x27;s major fast-food chains, released this statement about Schlosser and his book: &quot;It is unfortunate that Mr. Schlosser&#x27;s book, &#x27;Fast Food Nation,&#x27; categorizes the entire fast-food industry in such a negative light. The restaurant companies that comprise the industry provide employment to hundreds of thousands of workers across the country and offer consumers a wide variety in menu options and prices. We take exception to the characterization in this book.&quot;

Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University and a former meat inspector for the USDA, says he has read only &quot;snippets&quot; of Schlosser&#x27;s book but calls it &quot;well-intentioned criticism.&quot;

==&quot;Chew on This&quot;==

An adaptation of &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; for younger readers titled &quot;Chew on This: Everything You Don&#x27;t Want to Know about Fast Food&quot; was published in May 2006 by Houghton Mifflin. &quot;Chew on This&quot; was first published in 2006, is an adaptation of the main work created by Schlosser and Charles Wilson for younger readers. This book follows the general plot structure of &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, but simplifies its predecessor&#x27;s original content to make it more readable for younger children. 

=== Reception ===
Some critical reception has been positive. Common Sense Media gave the book 4/5 stars, but writing that &quot;...the photographs seem randomly placed throughout the book, and the narrative can wander a bit. Even so, teens probably will be inspired to rethink their habits.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Shrewsbury was fought on 21 July 1403, waged between an army led by the Lancastrian King Henry IV and a rebel army led by Henry &quot;Harry Hotspur&quot; Percy from Northumberland. The battle, the first in which English archers fought each other on English soil, reaffirmed the effectiveness of the longbow and ended the Percy challenge to King Henry IV of England.

Part of the fighting is believed to have taken place at what is now Battlefield, Shropshire, England, three miles (5 km) north of the centre of Shrewsbury. It is marked today by Battlefield Church and Battlefield Heritage Park.

==Background==
The Percys had previously supported Henry IV in a war against King Richard II of England, which ended when Henry IV took the throne in 1399. The Percys subsequently supported Henry IV in Wales, early in the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr, and in Scotland, in both negotiations and conflict against the Scots.

King Henry IV had been supported by a number of wealthy landowners to whom he had promised land, money and royal favour in return for their continued support. When the war ended, lands in and around Cumberland promised to the Percys were instead given to a rival. The promised money never materialised, and so the Percys revolted. Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester, publicly renounced their allegiance to King Henry IV. They charged him with perjury because he claimed the throne in addition to his old lands and titles, taxed the clergy despite his promise not to without the consent of Parliament, imprisoned and murdered King Richard II, did not allow a free Parliamentary election, and refused to pay a just ransom to Owain Glyndŵr, who was then holding Edmund Mortimer. The King also retained custody of the Scottish nobles captured at Homildon Hill as prisoners of war rather than permitting the Percys to release them for ransom.

Henry Percy, nicknamed &quot;Hotspur&quot;, raised a group initially of about 200 retainers in early July 1403, and started the long march south to meet his uncle, Thomas Percy. Some nobles joined him, such as Lord Bardolf, but he recruited most of his army in Cheshire, an area hostile to Henry IV, which provided many experienced soldiers, notably its Cheshire archers, some of whom had served as Richard II&#x27;s bodyguard. Henry Percy may have hoped for reinforcements from Wales under the Prince of Wales, Owain Glyndŵr, but he was disappointed. Glyndŵr, at the time fighting in Carmarthenshire, was unaware that Hotspur had acted. Some Welsh forces from the Cheshire borders may have joined him. The rebels then marched towards Shrewsbury, the heavily defended county town in Shropshire.

King Henry IV only became aware of the Percy forces on 12 July, apparently while he was marching an army north to assist the Percys against the Scots, receiving the news at Burton-on-Trent. He may have anticipated the Percys&#x27; change of heart, but instantly altered his plans to meet the immediate threat posed by the Percys. He changed direction and marched west towards Shrewsbury with his army, arriving before the Percys could capture the town.

Both forces arrived in the Shrewsbury area on 20 July and set up camp to the north and south of the River Severn, which loops around the town. Hotspur based himself initially at the house of William Betton, his army camping close to the town. The next day the King&#x27;s forces crossed the Severn at Uffington, about a mile to the east of Shrewsbury, to cut off Percy&#x27;s line of retreat to Chester. They failed, and the armies took up position in a field that was variously named: &quot;Haytleyfield&quot;, &quot;Husefeld&quot;, &quot;Berwykfeld&quot;, &quot;Bolefeld&quot;. The battle commenced in the manor of Harlescott about a mile south west of where Battlefield Church now stands. (The owner of this manor, Richard Hussey, swore to this fact under oath in the escheator&#x27;s court in January 1416.) The battle took place in a large field of peas.{{ Estimates of the sizes of the two armies vary widely, and the medieval chronicles are subject to exaggeration. &quot;Annales Henrici Quarti&quot; states 14,000 Royal troops, far fewer than Waurin&#x27;s estimate of 60,000. John Capgrave writing in the &quot;Chronicle of England&quot; quotes Percy&#x27;s army as 14,000.

For much of the morning of Saturday 21 July, the two forces parleyed. Thomas Prestbury, the Abbot of Shrewsbury and the Abbot of Haughmond presented the King&#x27;s terms. Hotspur declined any terms and Thomas Percy spoke to the King, trading insults. Henry Percy was somewhat inclined toward accepting the king&#x27;s position, while his uncle Thomas Percy was not. Negotiations ended near noon, and the two forces advanced closer for the fight. One rebel, later pardoned, went over to the royal army and the king knighted several of his followers.

==Battle==

{{More citations needed|date=July 2020}}
About two hours before dusk, King Henry IV raised his sword. The battle opened with a massive archery barrage, arrows killing or wounding many men before they could meet hand to hand in the field. Percy&#x27;s Cheshire bowmen proved generally superior. Thomas Walsingham recorded how the King&#x27;s men &quot;fell like leaves in Autumn, every one [arrow] struck a mortal man&quot;. According to the &quot;Dieulacres Chronicle&quot; the King&#x27;s right wing under the command of the Earl of Stafford (who was killed) fled from the field. Far more than this wing may have fled as well, as there is evidence that some baggage was looted and after the battle the Cheshire rebels were &quot;prosecuted&quot; for taking some 7,000 horses with them. Prince Henry, Prince of Wales was hit in the face with an arrow during the fighting, sustaining a terrible wound. He later recovered due to the skilled treatment of the Physician General John Bradmore, who used honey, alcohol and a specially designed surgical instrument to extract the arrowhead. He was left with a permanent scar. Bradmore recorded treating Prince Henry in his Latin manuscript, &quot;Philomena.&quot; An account of this can also be found in Thomas Morstede&#x27;s 1446 surgical treatise.

Enough of the King&#x27;s men remained on the field, particularly on the left wing, which was under the command of the Prince of Wales. Perhaps in desperation, Hotspur led a charge aimed at killing the King himself, during which the Royal Standard was overthrown and its bearer, Sir Walter Blount, was hacked down either by Percy himself or by Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas. Hotspur was killed in the charge, reputedly shot in the face with an arrow when he opened his visor. His death was initially not realised, and at some point soon afterwards the Northumbrian knights hailed the death of Henry IV, exclaiming &quot;Henry Percy King!&quot;. Henry IV was not dead however, and retaliated by shouting &quot;Henry Percy is dead&quot;; the absence of a reply confirmed that Henry Percy was indeed dead. The battle ended soon after. It is recorded that many did not know who had won.
==Aftermath==
Henry Percy was initially buried by his maternal first cousin, Thomas Nevill, 5th Baron Furnivall at Whitchurch, Shropshire, with honours, but rumours soon spread that he was not really dead. In response, the King had him disinterred. His body was salted, set up in Shrewsbury impaled on a spear between two millstones in the marketplace pillory, with an armed guard, and was later quartered and put on display in Chester, London, Bristol and Newcastle upon Tyne. His head was sent to York and impaled on the north gate, looking toward his own lands. In November his remains were returned to his widow Elizabeth.

The Earl of Worcester was beheaded and Sir Richard Venables, Sir Richard Vernon and Sir Henry Boynton were publicly hanged, drawn and quartered in Shrewsbury on 23 July and their heads publicly displayed, Thomas Percy&#x27;s on London Bridge.

Battlefield Church is said to have been erected over the site of the mass burial pit dug immediately after the battle. It was built initially as a memorial chapel, on the orders of King Henry IV and paid for by him, with prayers and masses being said continually for the dead on both sides. The chapel was replaced in 1460 by a church, which was further restored in 1862. A drain being dug in a corner of the churchyard may have inadvertently opened part of the burial pit. Workmen were surprised by the mass of bones which they thought showed the hurried nature of the burials. They may have merely unearthed a charnel pit containing bones of a variety of different ages.

In 2006, the BBC show &quot;Two Men in a Trench&quot; proved only that an area to the west of the church was not in fact a graveyard.

There were two other 15th-century churches associated with battles. The one at Towton no longer exists, but remains of it have been identified as lying beneath the present-day Towton Hall by the archaeologist Tim Sutherland. The other for the battle of Wakefield still stands on Wakefield Bridge. Neither was near the battlefield.

==Cultural references==
The battle itself and many of the key people involved appear in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, with the fictional participation of Sir John Falstaff and Hotspur being killed by Prince Henry. It is also depicted in the 1966 movie &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (released in the UK as &quot;Falstaff&quot;), in the 2012 BBC Two adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play, and in the climax to a historical novel by Edith Pargeter, &quot;A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury&quot; (1972) (US title: &quot;The Bloody Field&quot;).

The battle features in an early and highly inaccurate sequence in the 2019 David Michod film &quot;The King&quot;, in which the battle does not take place because Prince Henry, wresting command of the royal forces from his brother Thomas, and Hotspur fight in single combat rather than having the battle fought. After a lengthy scene in which the duel begins with swords and ends up a wrestling match, Prince Henry kills Hotspur by stabbing him in the neck and the day is won. The motivations for the rebellion – the king&#x27;s refusal to ransom Edmund Mortimer and the discontent of the Percys with Henry IV&#x27;s regime – are left intentionally vague. Prince Henry, later ascending the throne as Henry V, begins his reign with a policy of conciliation, with one of his first stated acts being the ransoming of Mortimer.

It is understood{{By whom|date=March 2024}} that Hotspur and his forces slept overnight near Berwick. A legend says that when the forces were marshalled on the morning of battle, he suddenly discovered that he was without his favourite sword which was left behind at Berwick, upon hearing this he:became agitated and exclaimed, &quot;I perceive that my plough is drawing to its last furrow, for a wizard in Northumberland told me that I should perish at Berwick, which I understood to refer to Berwick in the north&quot;. The Wizard’s prophecy appears to have been fulfilled, for the gallant soldier fell a victim to his enemies and died on the field of battle.

<text>The Battle of Lipany (in Czech: &quot;Bitva u Lipan&quot;), also called the Battle of Český Brod, was fought at Lipany 40 km east of Prague on 30 May 1434 and virtually ended the Hussite Wars. An army of moderate Hussite (or Calixtine) nobility and Catholics, called the Bohemian League, defeated the radical Taborites and Orphans (or &quot;Sirotci&quot;) led by Prokop the Great, the overall commander, and by Jan Čapek of Sány, the cavalry commander.

== Battle ==
The radicals set up a &quot;Wagenburg&quot; on a strategically advantageous hill, and both armies stood opposite each other for some time. An attempt by the Calixtines/Utraquists to negotiate and peacefully resolve the conflict failed on account of the irreconcilable positions of the two sides. Three days after the unsuccessful negotiations, the Leaguers advanced to the radicals&#x27; encampment. Although the following mutual cannonade was harmless due to distance between the two armies, to the surprise of the radicals the Leaguers began to retreat with all their wagons.

Thinking that the enemy was fleeing, the radicals&#x27; commanders opened the &quot;Wagenburg&quot; to attack the Leaguers&#x27; formation, not knowing that the retreat was a trick to draw them out of the &quot;Wagenburg&quot;. As the radicals approached the Leaguers&#x27; army, the Leaguers stopped and began to fire from their wagons. At the same time, the Leaguers&#x27; heavy cavalry, which had been hidden near the radicals&#x27; camp, undertook a surprise attack from the side and penetrated into the open &quot;Wagenburg&quot;. The radicals&#x27; army quickly collapsed and the commander of the Orphans&#x27; cavalry, Čapek of Sány, fled with all his men to the nearby town of Kolín.

The battle now changed into a massacre of the lightly equipped radical forces. Both Prokop the Great and were killed making a last stand at the wagons. Some prominent leaders of the radicals, including Jan Roháč of Dubá, were captured, but about 700 ordinary soldiers who surrendered after promises of renewed military service were burned to death in nearby barns.

== Aftermath ==
As a consequence of the battle, the Taborite army was markedly weakened, and the Orphans virtually ceased to exist as a military force. The road towards acceptance of the Compacts of Basel was now open, and it was signed on 5 July 1436 in Jihlava. The next month, Sigismund was accepted as King of Bohemia by all major factions. Sigismund commented on the Battle of Lipany that &quot;the Bohemians could be overcome only by Bohemians.&quot;

The last formation of Taborites under the command of Jan Roháč of Dubé was besieged at his castle Sion near Kutná Hora. It was then captured by Sigismund&#x27;s forces, and on 9 September 1437 Roháč, still refusing to accept Sigismund as his king, was hanged in Prague.

<text>Polaroid is a type of synthetic plastic sheet which is used as a polarizer or polarizing filter. A trademark of the Polaroid Corporation, the term has since entered common use.

==Patent==
The original material, patented in 1929 and further developed in 1932 by Edwin H. Land, consists of many microscopic crystals of iodoquinine sulphate (herapathite) embedded in a transparent nitrocellulose polymer film. The needle-like crystals are aligned during the manufacture of the film by stretching or by applying electric or magnetic fields. With the crystals aligned, the sheet is dichroic: it tends to absorb light which is polarized parallel to the direction of crystal alignment but to transmit light which is polarized perpendicular to it.

The resultant electric field of an electromagnetic wave (such as light) determines its polarization. If the wave interacts with a line of crystals as in a sheet of polaroid, any varying electric field in the direction parallel to the line of the crystals will cause a current to flow along this line. The electrons moving in this current will collide with other particles and re-emit the light backwards and forwards. This will cancel the incident wave causing little or no transmission through the sheet.

The component of the electric field perpendicular to the line of crystals, however, can cause only small movements in the electrons as they cannot move very much from side to side. This means there will be little change in the perpendicular component of the field leading to transmission of the part of the light wave polarized perpendicular to the crystals only, hence allowing the material to be used as a light polarizer.
This material, known as &quot;J-sheet&quot;, was later replaced by the improved &quot;H-sheet&quot; Polaroid, invented in 1938 by Land. H-sheet is a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer impregnated with iodine. During manufacture, the PVA polymer chains are stretched such that they form an array of aligned, linear molecules in the material. The iodine dopant attaches to the PVA molecules and makes them conducting along the length of the chains. Light polarized parallel to the chains is absorbed, and light polarized perpendicular to the chains is transmitted.

Another type of Polaroid is the &quot;K-sheet&quot; polarizer, which consists of aligned polyvinylene chains in a PVA polymer created by dehydrating PVA. This polarizer material is particularly resistant to humidity and heat.

==Applications==
Polarizing sheets are used in liquid-crystal displays, optical microscopes and sunglasses. Since Polaroid sheet is dichroic, it will absorb impinging light of one plane of polarization, so sunglasses will reduce the partially polarized light reflected from level surfaces such as windows and sheets of water, for example. They are also used to examine for chain orientation in transparent plastic products made from polystyrene or polycarbonate.

The intensity of light passing through a Polaroid polarizer is described by Malus&#x27; law.

<text>The European Women&#x27;s Handball Championship is the official competition for senior women&#x27;s national handball teams of Europe, and takes place every two years. In addition to crowning the European champions, the tournament also serves as a qualifying tournament for the Olympic Games and World Championship. As of December 2024, the only teams that have ever won the championship are Norway (ten times), Denmark (three times), Hungary, Montenegro and France (each once).

==History==
In year 1946, the International Handball Federation was founded by eight European nations, and though non-European nations competed at the World Championships, the medals had always been taken by European nations. European Handball Federation is founded in 1991. At the same time (1995), the World Championship was changed from a quadrennial to a biannual event, and the European Handball Federation now began its own championship – which also acted as a regional qualifier for the World Championship. The tournament will be expanded to 24 teams in 2024 to take place in Austria, Hungary and Switzerland.

<doc id="159074" wikidata="Q1552362" url="?curid=159074" title="Gerrie Coetzee">
<text>Gerhardus Christian Coetzee OIB (8 April 1955 – 12 January 2023) was a South African professional boxer who competed from 1974 to 1986, and in 1993 and 1997. He was the first African in history to ever fight for, and win, a world heavyweight championship, having held the WBA title from 1983 to 1984. He held notable knockout wins against WBA world heavyweight champion Michael Dokes and undisputed world heavyweight champion Leon Spinks, as well as a draw with future WBC world heavyweight champion Pinklon Thomas and wins over top contenders Ron Stander, Scott LeDoux and James Tillis.

One of Coetzee&#x27;s nicknames, &quot;The Bionic Hand&quot;, came about because of persistent troubles with his right hand, which required the insertion of several corrective items during three surgeries. His Afrikaans nickname was &quot;Seer Handjies&quot;, or &quot;Sore Little Hands&quot;, named so by fellow South African boxing great Kallie Knoetze.

Coetzee died of lung cancer on 12 January 2023, at the age of 67.

==Professional career==
===Rise to championship contention===
Coetzee started boxing professionally on the night of 14 September 1974, when he beat 19 fight veteran and fellow South African Christian Roos by a decision in four. Coetzee followed his early success with a string of victories in his homeland. Among those wins was one over Roos in a rematch, which Coetzee won by a knockout in three rounds; he also defeated South African Mike Schutte who had been casually considered as a potential gimmick opponent for Muhammad Ali. Coetzee&#x27;s other notable wins included defeating former world title challengers Ron Stander, Randy Stephens, and Pierre Fourie; a South African Heavyweight championship victory against amateur rival Kallie Knoetze (unanimous decision in 10) as well as a first-round knockout of former world heavyweight champion Leon Spinks. With exception of the Spinks bout, held at Monte Carlo, the majority of Coetzee&#x27;s fights during his early run were held in his native South Africa.

In the fight with Spinks, the former champion attacked Coetzee and pressured him, throwing punches from many angles and trying to steam-roll the South African. Coetzee composed himself and, with a short right hand delivered to Spinks&#x27; temple, knocked down the former world champion. Coetzee proceeded to drop Spinks two more times to record a first round technical knockout. The win enhanced Coetzee&#x27;s reputation as a real title threat in the post-Ali landscape of the heavyweight division.

===First world title attempt===
Coetzee as the #2 contender was matched with John Tate for the WBA heavyweight title that had been left vacant by Muhammad Ali’s retirement. The bout was held in Pretoria and in fact this event was the first time blacks were allowed into the venue (Loftus Versfeld).

Coetzee was the first African-born heavyweight ever to challenge for a world title. The Boksburg Bomber fought a tentative bout and, after holding his own early, faded from the midpoint of the bout onward. Tate won a decision over 15 rounds. Coetzee would reveal later in his career that in his early fighting years, he struggled with self-confidence, particularly in measuring up to American fighters.

Coetzee himself was vocal in his opposition to apartheid. To provide context: The first major boxing event in South Africa to change the face of sports in apartheid South Africa was the fight between Bob Foster and Pierre Fourie on 1 December 1973. This laid firm foundations for racially mixed boxing in front of racially mixed audiences. Mixed bouts between South Africans were legalised in 1977, but the last vestiges of the colour bar disappeared only two years later when the system of white, black and supreme titles was abolished.

The first multiracial South African title fights were held at the Rand Stadium in Johannesburg on 27 November 1976 when Coetzee defeated the top black challenger James Mathatho with a seventh round knockout in a heavyweight bout for the SA championship. On the same card, Elijah &#x27;Tap Tap&#x27; Makhatini beat white contender Jan Kies to become the undisputed South African middleweight champion.

===Second world title attempt===
Tate lasted only a short time as WBA world titlist, as he was KO&#x27;d in spectacular last-round fashion by Mike Weaver in his first title defense. In the meantime, Coetzee had maintained his status as a highly rated contender by bombing out Mike Koraniki in the first round to keep his title hopes alive.

The new title holder Weaver traveled to South Africa in 1980 to defend his title against Coetzee, fighting in front of a very large crowd. Coetzee dominated the early portions, and had Weaver hurt several times. In the 8th, Weaver was in serious trouble but Coetzee could not capitalize.

With the opportunity to finish Weaver gone, Coetzee seemed to wilt. Weaver was beginning to time Coetzee&#x27;s punches for counters. By round 12 the fight was close to even, with the South African&#x27;s lead having evaporated. Weaver had survived Coetzee&#x27;s onslaught and the tide had turned. Coetzee&#x27;s stamina failed him and he had begun to throw fewer punches after round 9. Coetzee was now leaning and mauling more and was getting hit more often coming in with his unprotected head held high. Weaver was accelerating and was getting the better of exchanges as the bout wore on. Coetzee was knocked down for the first time in his career and failed to beat the count having been floored by a big counter punch in the 13th round. Coetzee lost the bout by a TKO.

===Road to a third title bout===
Less than 5 months after the loss against Weaver, Coetzee returned to the ring and beat fringe contender George Chaplin before facing Renaldo Snipes. Coetzee dropped Snipes twice early and seemed to dominate the action. However, the fight was scored by rounds and not on points, meaning a round won widely with knockdowns was no more valued than a round lost narrowly, and he lost a ten-round decision that was deemed one of the worst of the decade.

Coetzee had gone 5–1 in the 6 fights since the Weaver bout. Among the wins was one over former title challenger Scott Le Doux heading into a bout with the up-and-coming future WBC champion Pinklon Thomas. Again, Coetzee held the edge in the first half of the bout but Thomas rallied to hold Coetzee to a draw, although the result did work against either fighter. Following his loss to Snipes and draw with Thomas, Coetzee was not considered a strong title contender, but he was still highly ranked.

===WBA heavyweight champion===

Perhaps because of his success against Thomas in the first half of their fight, Coetzee received his third world title try against WBA champion Michael Dokes. By now known as someone who could not win &quot;The Big One&quot;, Coetzee&#x27;s predicted fate in this bout was to show-case the Don King-promoted Dokes&#x27; abilities and status as a rising star.

The fight took place on 23 September 1983 at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio. Coetzee dominated Dokes after a few rounds of even fighting. The South African led with aggression but also used counter punching as well. Coetzee&#x27;s poise was apparent, and he boxed more deftly than usual employing more left hooks rather than merely swinging his potent right hand. He continued to eschew much in the way of defense, sponging anything Dokes could land. In the 5th, he scored a knockdown and the commentary on the fight revolved around his poise and control.. much different than a man lacking on confidence. After seizing control and dominating, Coetzee knocked out Dokes in the tenth round to become South Africa&#x27;s first world Heavyweight title holder. He also became the first Caucasian world heavyweight champion in 23 years. The fight was KO Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Upset of The Year&quot; for 1983.

It turned out that the punch that knocked out Dokes hurt Coetzee even more: his right hand was broken and required surgery five days after the fight, in New York City.

===Failed unification and defeat===
There was much talk about a unification bout with the recognized best fighter in the division and now International Boxing Federation Champion, Larry Holmes, in 1984, and a contract for a lucrative bout was signed. Holmes possessed only one of the 3 title belts but was recognized by most as the real, bona fide, champion.

Financial problems arose when the backer of the bout, JPD Sports out of Dallas, Texas, could not raise the original purse necessary. Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas spoke of saving the promotion, but it fell through. Don King&#x27;s involvement as Coetzee&#x27;s promoter, as well as Larry Holmes&#x27; previous split with King also contributed to the bout not coming to fruition. Holmes wanted to save the bout which would have earned both him and Coetzee a significant sum of money. Coetzee was personally willing and eager for the bout. He even indicated he was willing to go through with the bout though he would likely enter the ring without the WBA title. The WBA had stated that for the bout to take place with its blessing, it required Holmes to fight as a contender for Coetzee&#x27;s belt. Or, the WBA would require Coetzee to drop his belt to qualify as a challenger for Holmes.

Holmes saw no reason for the WBA to preside over a bout between the two men. The WBA insisted Coetzee could not face Holmes, despite the fact Holmes had been recognized as the best heavyweight in the world since 1978. In any event, Coetzee re-injured his hand during training camp, requiring further surgery, and the fight was cancelled.

On his return to the ring, after an extended absence, Coetzee was paired with Greg Page (the real #1 contender David Bey, refused to go to South Africa as described in &quot;Only in America: The Life and Crimes of Don King&quot; by Jack Newfield, Bey became the #1 by outpointing Greg Page over 12 rounds). Page was even more stigmatized by failing to win big fights than was Coetzee. He was seen as supremely talented and like many fighters in the immediate post-Ali era, his size, speed, and coordination supposedly portended great expectations of achievement. While Page could look extremely impressive, as against James Tillis for example, he also was seen as lazy and unmotivated.

In this bout Page did less posing than normal, and did more fighting putting on an energetic performance. Coetzee seemed overconfident, and can be seen delivering a lot of the trash-talking and doing less punching and trying more verbal intimidation such as he used in bouts against Tate and Weaver. But Page was in much better form than when he had lost to Bey. Coetzee for his part was dangerous and while sloppy, was sending his own shots home. The challenger&#x27;s strong chin nullified Coetzee&#x27;s power to some extent. The two exchanged momentum. Coetzee&#x27;s lack of defense was more evident than usual, and he was a sitting duck for Page&#x27;s counter-punching and his once dependable chin seemed to fail him, being stung and hurt often. His right was not effective, but he was scoring with his left hand. He was dropped after the bell of the 6th round in a foul; and in the 7th legitimately. Page was taking advantage of Coetzee&#x27;s recklessness. In exchange after exchange as the bout wore on, it was Coetzee, the &quot;puncher&quot;, losing the skirmishes and being hurt. He was knocked out in Round 8. But, there was controversy.

Coetzee&#x27;s camp protested that not only had the 8th round run too long, but also that while Coetzee was on the canvas the bell had sounded and the referee&#x27;s count should have been waved off. Generally, this would have allowed Coetzee to continue for at least one more round. The 8th, the round in question actually did run for almost a minute too long. Despite this, the WBA recognized the result as it happened, and affirmed Page as the winner by a knockout in eight. Coetzee and his camp demanded an immediate rematch. Instead, Page went on to face Tony Tubbs whom he had beaten several times in the amateurs.

===Post-championship career===
After losing his title, Coetzee made token attempts at a comeback. He beat the former title challenger and at that time mid-level foe James &quot;Quick&quot; Tillis by a decision in ten. Next was a journey to England to fight the big-punching contender Frank Bruno. In the offing would be a shot at the WBA title, since won by Tim Witherspoon (who had defeated Tubbs, who had defeated Page). Coetzee was knocked out in round one. After that fight, he announced his retirement, but came back twice during the 1990s, winning by knockout in three against both Dave Fiddler and West Turner in 1993, and then winning against Dan Komiscki in three. Finally in 1997, Coetzee lost to former world Middleweight and Light Heavyweight champion Iran Barkley by a knockout in ten, after dropping him in round two, for the WBB Superheavyweight belt.

<doc id="159078" wikidata="Q930367" url="?curid=159078" title="Crumhorn">
<text>The crumhorn is a double reed instrument of the woodwind family, most commonly used during the Renaissance period. In modern times, particularly since the 1960s, there has been a revival of interest in early music, and crumhorns are being played again. It was also spelled krummhorn, krumhorn, krum horn, and cremorne.

==Terminology==
The name derives from the German (or or ) meaning &quot;bent horn&quot;. This relates to the old English meaning curve, surviving in modern English in &#x27;crumpled&#x27; and &#x27;crumpet&#x27; (a curved cake). The similar-sounding French term , when used correctly, refers to a woodwind instrument of different design, though the term is often used in error synonymously with that of crumhorn.

It is uncertain if the Spanish wind instrument (attested in an inventory of 1559) designates the crumhorn, but it is known that crumhorns were used in Spain in the 16th century, and the identification seems likely.

Three Italian terms for the instrument, apart from the equivalent , are , , and .

==Description==

The crumhorn is a &quot;capped reed&quot; instrument. Its construction is similar to that of the chanter of a bagpipe. A double reed is mounted inside a long windcap. Blowing through a slot in the windcap produces a musical note. The pitch of the note can be varied by opening or closing finger holes along the length of the pipe. One unusual feature of the crumhorn is its shape; the end is bent upwards in a curve resembling the letter &#x27;J&#x27;. The curve is decorative only and does not influence the sound.

Crumhorns make a strong buzzing sound, but quieter than their conical-bore relatives the rauschpfeife and shawm. They have a limited range, usually a ninth. While it is theoretically possible to get the reed to overblow a twelfth above the fundamental note, this is extremely difficult because the reed is not held in the mouth (and even if done would result in a gap of two notes in the scale on historical instruments), and in practice all playing is confined to the fundamental series. Some larger instruments have their range extended downwards by means of additional holes, keys and sliders, and the pitch of the instrument can be lowered a perfect fourth by dropping the breath pressure (called &quot;underblowing&quot;). Some modern instruments have their range extended upwards to an eleventh by two keys. Crumhorns can be chromatically played by using cross-fingerings, except for the minor second above the lowest note.

==Different sizes==
Because of the limited range, music for crumhorns is usually played by a group of instruments of different sizes and hence at different pitches. Such a group is known as a consort of crumhorns. Crumhorns are built in imitation of the vocal quartet with soprano, alto, tenor and bass as a family, as was true of most instruments of the Renaissance. There are examples of higher- and lower-sounding instruments, of which the great bass is the only commonly used one. Modern instruments are pitched in C and F (Renaissance altos were usually pitched in g, continuing the distance of a fifth between sizes):

==Literature for crumhorn==
There are some pieces specifying crumhorns in two manuscript sets of partbooks prepared for the Prussian court band, including an anonymous setting of &quot;D’Andernach auff dem Reine&quot;. Johann Hermann Schein included a for crumhorns in his collection (1617), and Thomas Stoltzer wrote in a letter that he had composed his setting of Psalm 37, &quot;&quot; (1526), such that the lower six of the seven parts could be played on crumhorns. Michael Praetorius suggested the use of crumhorns in some of his sacred vocal works as a possible alternative to trombones, dulcians and other instruments.

In Ursula Dubosarsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Bruno and the Crumhorn&quot;, two children, Bruno and Sybil, find themselves learning to play the crumhorn almost by accident.

<doc id="159081" wikidata="Q129302" url="?curid=159081" title="Shock (mechanics)">
<text>In mechanics and physics, shock is a sudden acceleration caused, for example, by impact, drop, kick, earthquake, or explosion. Shock is a transient physical excitation.

Shock describes matter subject to extreme rates of force with respect to time. Shock is a vector that has units of an acceleration (rate of change of velocity). The unit &quot;g&quot; (or g) represents multiples of the standard acceleration of gravity and is conventionally used.

A shock pulse can be characterised by its peak acceleration, the duration, and the shape of the shock pulse (half sine, triangular, trapezoidal, etc.). The shock response spectrum is a method for further evaluating a mechanical shock.

==Shock measurement==
Shock measurement is of interest in several fields such as
*Propagation of heel shock through a runner&#x27;s body
*Measure the magnitude of a shock need to cause damage to an item: fragility.
*Measure shock attenuation through athletic flooring 
*Measuring the effectiveness of a shock absorber
*Measuring the shock absorbing ability of package cushioning
*Measure the ability of an athletic helmet to protect people
*Measure the effectiveness of shock mounts
*Determining the ability of structures to resist seismic shock: earthquakes, etc.
*Determining whether personal protective fabric attenuates or amplifies shocks
*Verifying that a Naval ship and its equipment can survive explosive shocks 

Shocks are usually measured by accelerometers but other transducers and high speed imaging are also used. A wide variety of laboratory instrumentation is available; stand-alone shock data loggers are also used.

Field shocks are highly variable and often have very uneven shapes. Even laboratory controlled shocks often have uneven shapes and include short duration spikes; Noise can be reduced by appropriate digital or analog filtering.

Governing test methods and specifications provide detail about the conduct of shock tests. Proper placement of measuring instruments is critical. Fragile items and packaged goods respond with variation to uniform laboratory shocks; Replicate testing is often called for. For example, MIL-STD-810G Method 516.6 indicates: &quot;at least three times in both directions along each of three orthogonal axes&quot;.

==Shock testing==

Shock testing typically falls into two categories, classical shock testing and pyroshock or ballistic shock testing. Classical shock testing consists of the following shock impulses: half sine, haversine, sawtooth wave, and trapezoid. Pyroshock and ballistic shock tests are specialized and are not considered classical shocks. Classical shocks can be performed on Electro Dynamic (ED) Shakers, Free Fall Drop Tower or Pneumatic Shock Machines. A classical shock impulse is created when the shock machine table changes direction abruptly. This abrupt change in direction causes a rapid velocity change which creates the shock impulse. Testing the effects of shock are sometimes conducted on end-use applications: for example, automobile crash tests.

Use of proper test methods and Verification and validation protocols are important for all phases of testing and evaluation.

== Effects of shock ==
Mechanical shock has the potential for damaging an item (e.g., an entire light bulb) or an element of the item (e.g. a filament in an Incandescent light bulb):
* A brittle or fragile item can fracture. For example, two crystal wine glasses may shatter when impacted against each other. A shear pin in an engine is designed to fracture with a specific magnitude of shock. Note that a soft ductile material may sometimes exhibit brittle failure during shock due to time-temperature superposition.
* A malleable item can be bent by a shock. For example, a copper pitcher may bend when dropped on the floor.
* Some items may appear to be not damaged by a single shock but will experience fatigue failure with numerous repeated low-level shocks.
* A shock may result in only minor damage which may not be critical for use. However, cumulative minor damage from several shocks will eventually result in the item being unusable.
* A shock may not produce immediate apparent damage but might cause the service life of the product to be shortened: the reliability is reduced.
* A shock may cause an item to become out of adjustment. For example, when a precision scientific instrument is subjected to a moderate shock, good metrology practice may be to have it recalibrated before further use.
* Some materials such as primary high explosives may detonate with mechanical shock or impact.
* When glass bottles of liquid are dropped or subjected to shock, the water hammer effect may cause hydrodynamic glass breakage.

== Considerations ==
When laboratory testing, field experience, or engineering judgement indicates that an item could be damaged by mechanical shock, several courses of action might be considered:
* Reduce and control the input shock at the source.
* Modify the item to improve its toughness or support it to better handle shocks.
* Use shock absorbers, shock mounts, or cushions to control the shock transmitted to the item. Cushioning reduces the peak acceleration by extending the duration of the shock.
* Plan for failures: accept certain losses. Have redundant systems available, etc.

<doc id="159083" wikidata="Q938795" url="?curid=159083" title="Ford Taurus">
<text>The Ford Taurus is an automobile that was manufactured and marketed by the Ford Motor Company in the United States from 1985 to 2019. From 1985 to 2009, Ford marketed the Taurus alongside its rebadged variant, the Mercury Sable. Four generations of the high-performance version (named the Ford Taurus SHO) were also manufactured from 1988-1999 and 2009-2019. 

The original Taurus was a milestone for Ford and the American automotive industry, as the first automobile at Ford designed and manufactured using the statistical process control ideas brought to Ford by W. Edwards Deming, a prominent statistician consulted by Ford to bring a &quot;culture of quality&quot; to the enterprise. The Taurus had an influential design that introduced new features and innovations.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, sales of the Taurus declined as it lost market share to Japanese mid-size sedans and as Ford shifted resources towards developing SUVs. The Taurus was withdrawn after the 2007 model year, with production ending on October 27, 2006. As part of a model line revision, the Taurus and the larger Ford Crown Victoria were to be replaced with the full-size Five Hundred and mid-size Fusion sedans; the Taurus station wagon was replaced with the Ford Freestyle wagon, branded as a crossover SUV. During the 2007 Chicago Auto Show, the nameplates of the Taurus and Sable were revived, intended as 2008 mid-cycle revisions of the Five Hundred. The Freestyle was renamed the Ford Taurus X. For the 2010 model year, Ford introduced the sixth-generation Taurus, marking a more substantial model update, alongside the revival of the Taurus SHO; in 2013, the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan was introduced as a successor for its long-running Crown Victoria counterpart.

From 1985 to 2007, the Taurus was a mid-size car, offering front-wheel drive. Initially built on the DN5 platform (renamed the DN101 platform in 1995 and the D186 platform in 1999), the Taurus became a full-size car in 2007, adopting the Volvo-derived D3 platform, offering front- or all-wheel drive. The Taurus was produced as a four-door sedan through its entire production, with a five-door station wagon offered from 1986 to 2005.

All generations of the Taurus were assembled by Chicago Assembly on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. Prior to its 2006 closure, Atlanta Assembly also produced both the Taurus and Sable. From its 1985 launch to its initial withdrawal following the 2007 model year, Ford assembled 7,519,919 examples of the Taurus. The fifth best-selling Ford nameplate in North America, the Taurus has been surpassed only by the F-Series, Escort, Model T, and Mustang. Between 1992 and 1996, the Taurus was the best-selling car nameplate in the United States, overtaken by the current title holder in 1997, the Toyota Camry.

== Taurus and the quality culture at Ford==

The Taurus was the first car resulting from introduction of a new quality culture at Ford. Between 1979 and 1982, Ford had incurred $3 billion in losses. In the spring of 1980, Ford Chairman Donald E. Peterson initiated a new &quot;team&quot; approach to the design and manufacture of automobiles at Ford, that eventually resulted in the creation of the Ford Taurus. Ford&#x27;s newly appointed Corporate Quality Director, Larry Moore, was charged with recruiting the famous statistician, W. Edwards Deming to help jump-start a quality movement at Ford. Deming told Ford that management actions were responsible for 85% of all problems in developing better cars. Based on Deming&#x27;s advice, Ford management was charged with primary responsibility for automobile quality. Ford also adopted a quality culture employing statistical process control across all aspects of automobile design and manufacture. The Ford Taurus was the first Ford model resulting from this statistical approach to manufacture. In a letter to Autoweek, Donald Petersen, then Ford chairman, said, &quot;We are moving toward building a quality culture at Ford and the many changes that have been taking place here have their roots directly in Deming&#x27;s teachings.&quot; This new emphasis on quality in the manufacture of the Ford Taurus was reflected in Ford&#x27;s advertising and marketing. The New York advertising firm Wells, Rich, Greene took on the Ford account in 1979 and Robert Cox was assigned to the Ford account and by the summer of 1981, &quot;Quality is Job 1&quot; became Ford&#x27;s calling card in marketing. This emphasis on quality was used heavily in marketing of the Ford Taurus.

==First generation (1986)==

The first-generation Taurus was launched in 1985 as a 1986 model to strong fanfare and sales, replacing the slow-selling mid-size Ford LTD. (The full-size Ford LTD Crown Victoria remained as part of the Ford lineup.) The release of the Ford Taurus was one of the most anticipated ever, mostly because it was a first in car design and also the start of new quality standards for Ford. At the time of the Taurus&#x27;s debut, Ford had been producing mainly rear-wheel drive cars, and Chrysler and General Motors were offering more front-wheel-drive vehicles up to mid-range including the Chrysler K platform and A-body Chevrolet Celebrity. With the introduction of the Escort and Tempo, Ford was making a transition to front-wheel drive. The Taurus displayed a rounder shape than its contemporaries, often likened to a &quot;jelly bean&quot; or &quot;flying potato&quot;, inspired by the design of the Audi 5000 and Ford&#x27;s European sedan, the Ford Sierra, an updated appearance of a styling approach used in the late 1940s to early 1960s called &quot;ponton&quot; styling. Instead of a grille, the Taurus mainstreamed the smooth grille-less &quot;bottom breather&quot; nose. The aerodynamic design of the Taurus made the car more fuel-efficient, allowing Ford to meet more stringent corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard applied by the United States government. The Taurus&#x27;s success ultimately led to an American automobile design revolution; Chrysler and General Motors developed aerodynamic cars in order to capitalize on the Taurus&#x27;s success. It also benefitted from sharing a similar appearance to the limited-production Ford Mustang SVO introduced two years earlier in 1983.

The first generation was available with either a V6 or an inline four-cylinder engine and came with either a manual (MT-5) or automatic transmission. (The Taurus&#x27;s twin, the Mercury Sable, has never offered a manual transmission in any of its incarnations.) Like its exterior, the Taurus&#x27;s interior was ahead of its time, and many features originating from it are still used in most cars today. Its interior was designed to be extremely user-friendly, with all of its controls designed to be recognizable by touch, allowing drivers to operate them without taking their eyes off the road. For example, the switches to the power windows and power locks were designed with one half of the switch raised up, with the other half recessed, in order for its function to be identified by touch. To further enhance this quality, the car&#x27;s dashboard has all of the controls in the central area within reach of the driver. The left side of the dash curves slightly around the driver to make controls easily accessible, as well as creating a &quot;cockpit&quot; feel.

The interior offered numerous trim levels, from spartan or luxurious, as well as various seating configurations, The most trim level, the L, featured an AM radio and a front cloth bench seat, while the LX, the more luxurious model, came with more numerous features as standard equipment.

The Taurus was well received by both the public and the press. In addition to numerous other awards, the Taurus was made the 1986 Car and Driver Ten Best List and was named the 1986 Motor Trend Car of the Year. Production reached over 200,000 for the 1986 model year and the millionth Taurus was sold during the 1989 model year. By the end of model year 1991, first generation production had reached more than two million.

==Second generation (1992)==


The Taurus received its first redesign in late 1991 for the 1992 model year, using the same chassis and with revisions to every exterior body panel other than the doors — largely as major facelift to the first generation design, gaining several inches in length and over 200 pounds in curb weight, and marketed solely V6 engines and automatic transmissions. The Taurus SHO made its return, with an automatic transmission option joining the manual transmission.

The interior was also completely revised, gaining an optional passenger-side airbag, which became standard for model year 1994 and becoming the first mid-size sedan marketed in the United States with standard dual airbags.

The second generation become the best-selling car in the United States, maintained the title throughout its duration, and reached a production of 1.4 million before ending in 1995.

==Third generation (1996)==

For the 1996 model year, Ford debuted the third generation of the Ford Taurus. Although not completely new, the chassis was heavily upgraded, becoming the DN101 generation. Alongside the Mercury Sable, the Ford Taurus shared its underpinnings with the redesigned Lincoln Continental and all-new Ford Windstar.

In 1996, its starting cost was about $18,000 ().

In a break from the familiar styling of the previous two generations (that chief designer Jack Telnack had likened to a &quot;pair of slippers&quot;), Ford had sought to again make the Taurus stand out for buyers of mid-size sedans, giving the vehicle a much more extensive restyling than its 1992 predecessor. Moving away from straight lines, the 1996 Taurus sought to include rounded lines, moving past the cab-forward design of the Chrysler LH sedans. Alongside the Ford Blue Oval emblem itself, the Taurus repeated the shape several places in its exterior; in a controversial design element, the rear window of the Taurus was oval, as were the side windows of the Mercury Sable. To allow better differentiation between models, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable were given separate rooflines; Taurus/Sable station wagons were fitted with the doors of Sable sedans.

The interior saw a complete redesign. To simplify production, all versions of the Taurus were fitted with bucket seats; six-passenger versions were fitted with a flip-forward center seat cushion also meant for use as a center console, while five-passenger versions were fitted with a floor shifter and center console. To improve ergonomics, radio and climate controls were centralized on an oval-shaped console on the dashboard.

Reaction to the third-generation Ford Taurus was mixed; Ford found that customers disliked the oval-shaped exterior. For 1996, the Ford Taurus stayed the best-selling car in the United States. At the time, 51 percent of all Taurus sales for 1996 went to rental fleets, in contrast to the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, of which most sales were to private customers through retail outlets. In 1997, the Ford Taurus lost its best-selling status to the Toyota Camry.

For 1996, Ford Australia imported the Ford Taurus sedan as the &quot;Taurus Ghia&quot; alongside its locally produced Ford Falcon EL, but imports ceased after only one year because of poor sales. Ford New Zealand imported both Ford Taurus sedans and station wagons from 1996 to 1998 with success alongside the RWD Australian Ford Falcon/Fairmont/Fairlane.

===NASCAR===

The third-generation Taurus had a presence in NASCAR, replacing the Thunderbird for the 1998 season. The Taurus became the first four-door sedan to be approved for competition. The first Taurus driver to win the Winston Cup (the NASCAR sponsor of the time) championship was Dale Jarrett, who drove No. 88 Ford Quality Care/Ford Credit-sponsored cars owned by Robert Yates. The first Taurus driver to win the Busch Series championship was Greg Biffle, who drove the No. 60 Grainger Industrial Supply-sponsored cars owned by Jack Roush.

In total, the Ford Taurus has won three Winston Cup championships and two Busch Series championships.

==Fourth generation (2000)==


The Taurus received another redesign for 2000, which replaced many of the oval-derived design elements of the previous model with sharper creases and corners, an aspect of Ford&#x27;s New Edge styling language. To reduce the car&#x27;s price and keep it competitive, Ford reduced costs on the car in 1999, such as giving the Taurus sedan rear drum brakes on ABS-equipped vehicles (previously, upgrading to ABS included the addition of rear disc brakes), eliminating the dual exhaust on the higher end models, and trimming many other small features.

Ford designed the fourth generation with more conservative styling. Instead of sloping back, the car&#x27;s trunk stood upright, increasing trunk space by another two cubic feet. The roof was more upright to increase headroom.

The interior was also redesigned with features from the previous Taurus generations carried over. The dashboard was given a squarer design. The &quot;integrated control panel&quot; concept was carried over but redesigned, with a bigger, squarer shape, and it was placed in the center of the dash instead of being angled toward the driver. The flip-fold center console was also carried over from the previous generation, although it was revised as well. When folded out, it now rested against the floor instead of the dashboard, and had reworked cup holders and storage areas. In another change from previous versions, the fourth generation offered rear cup holders that either slid or folded out of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with.

==Initial discontinuation and revival==
During its fourth generation, the Taurus saw a significant sales slump compared to its predecessors. Having already lost its status as the best-selling car in America when it was surpassed by the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry in 1997, by 2005, it had fallen to fourth-place behind the Nissan Altima, which made Ford decide to discontinue the entire Taurus line. Production of the Taurus wagon was discontinued on December 8, 2004; sedan retail sales halted after a short 2006 model year, and the Taurus became sold exclusively to fleets in the United States, while still being sold to retail customers in Canada. Production ended on October 27, 2006, as Ford idled the Atlanta plant, as part of its &quot;The Way Forward&quot; restructuring plan. The last Ford Taurus rolled off the assembly line around 7:00am, destined for delivery to S. Truett Cathy, owner of Chick-fil-A. Mr. Cathy&#x27;s original restaurant was located across from the Ford Atlanta plant. There was no official event or function of any kind to mark the end of production. The Taurus was replaced in Ford&#x27;s lineup by the Five Hundred and Fusion sedans, while the Taurus wagon was replaced by the Freestyle crossover SUV.

The discontinuation of the Taurus sparked debate given its once-strong position in the market and Ford&#x27;s well-publicized financial problems at the time. Analysts, customers and some interviewed Ford employees criticized the company for failing to invest in the car and keep it competitive, instead focusing all of its resources on developing and marketing trucks and SUVs. A USA Today editorial entitled &quot;How Ford starved its Taurus&quot; noted that the Taurus&#x27;s death was part of a broader trend of the Detroit Big Three willingly abandoning once-successful nameplates and divisions in search of &quot;the next big thing&quot;, while their foreign competitors have been gaining market share by continuously improving their veteran nameplates. This criticism was echoed by &quot;Autoblog&quot;, which held the Taurus up as an example of how Ford abandoned its successful products to chase emerging trends to varying degrees of success, a practice they blamed for Ford&#x27;s struggles at the time. &quot;The Truth About Cars&quot; similarly lamented how Ford neglected the Taurus to the point where it became a &quot;rental car&quot;.

Newly-hired Ford CEO Alan Mulally expressed similar opinions, telling the Associated Press the decision &quot;perplexed&quot; him when he learned about it; he recalled asking subordinates, &quot;How can it go away? It&#x27;s the best selling car in America!&quot; As the successor Five Hundred was struggling in the marketplace, Mulally viewed the decision to discontinue the Taurus as a &quot;mistake that needed to be fixed&quot;, noting, &quot;The customers want it back. They didn&#x27;t want it to go away. They wanted us to keep improving it.&quot; At the time, Ford had already unveiled a face-lifted Five Hundred at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, which had revised styling and a more powerful engine. Partially blaming the Five Hundred&#x27;s struggles on its name, Mulally decided that the revised vehicle should be marketed as the Taurus, the name he believed the Five Hundred sedan should have used from the beginning as he believed Ford was better off continuing to use its older nameplates that maintained decent brand equity rather than trying to build up new ones. The revised Five Hundred and Freestyle were showcased as the Taurus and Taurus X, respectively, at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show and went on sale that summer.

==Fifth generation (2008)==

The fifth-generation Taurus entered production in 2007 as a 2008 model and was developed directly from the Ford Five Hundred, chiefly with a mild exterior facelift and revised engine and transmission. Ford designated the model as the Taurus, after the demise of the concurrently marketed fourth-generation Taurus and to take advantage of its customer recognition and dealer demand.

Changes to the fifth-generation Taurus from the Five Hundred included a new front end and the 263 hp 3.5 L Duratec 35 V6, replacing the Duratec 30 3.0 L V6. The Five Hundred/Freestyle&#x27;s ZF-Batavia CVT, which had a maximum torque rating of , was also replaced with a Ford–GM joint venture six-speed automatic with additional torque of the Duratec 35. The Aisin AW six-speed automatic which was used on FWD Five Hundred and Montegos was also replaced by the new Ford six-speed.

The Taurus sedan twin, the Mercury Sable nameplate, was revived and applied to the restyled Mercury Montego. For the 2009 model year, Ford revived the &quot;SE&quot; trimline for the Taurus. The SE sold for $24,125 according to Ford&#x27;s website and served as the base model for the vehicle.

The fifth-generation Taurus was sold in the Middle East as the Ford Five Hundred from 2008.

It was determined that Ford&#x27;s strategy to redesignate new cars in the lineup with new names beginning with the letter &quot;F&quot;, as in Ford Focus, Ford Fusion, and Ford Freestyle, was not a good marketing move, as some of the renamed cars had highly recognizable iconic names. Car buyers in the U.S. did not associate the new &quot;F&quot; names with Ford, and were confused by the name changes. Mulally believed that the Taurus had an immediately strong brand equity, and that it would take years for consumers to have a similar recognition of the Five Hundred.

The 2008 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable were awarded the Top Safety Pick ratings by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and five-star ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The five-star rating given to the Taurus and the Sable is the highest safety rating being given by the government agency. It was also the first Ford of America model to come as standard with side airbags.

==Sixth generation (2010)==

The 2010 Ford Taurus was presented at the Detroit International Auto Show in 2009 at Cobo Hall. The press preview of the Taurus and Taurus SHO was held in Asheville, North Carolina, from June 15 to 19, 2009.

The Taurus scored well in test drives and the media was pleased with some of its new optional features. Some of these features included all-wheel drive, cross traffic alert, collision warning, blind spot monitoring, and adaptive cruise control. However, others criticized the lack of interior room and reduced sight lines despite its full-sized exterior, and Edmunds noted that the eighth-generation Honda Accord (which competes in the mid-size category) had superior driving dynamics and a more efficient design, while offering almost as much interior space as the Taurus despite considerably smaller external dimensions.

The base price of the base SE model was $25,995, mid-level SEL $27,995, and top-level Limited $31,995. Ford had hoped to sell 10–15% of the sixth-generation Tauruses as high-performance SHO models.

The SHO (Super High Output), released in August 2009, was powered by a twin-turbocharged, gasoline direct-injection EcoBoost 3.5L V6 engine. It produced up to and of torque. EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings were 17 mpg city and 25 mpg highway AWD. The SHO base price was $37,995, which included the EcoBoost V6 mated to an upgraded 6-speed automatic transmission, all-wheel drive, and numerous exterior and interior trim upgrades. A fully loaded SHO could reach $45,395. There was also an available performance package which included upgraded brake pads, a 3.16:1 final drive ratio (compared to the standard 2.77:1), recalibrated electronic power steering, further suspension tuning, a re-calibrated AdvanceTrac system (Ford&#x27;s combined traction control system and electronic stability control) with sport mode and &quot;true off&quot;, summer-only tread-compound Goodyear Eagle F1 245/45ZR20 tires, and an electric air pump with a canned tire inflator in lieu of a spare tire. Most options for the SHO remained available, with the Performance Package including options such as power moonroof, heated/cooled seats, multi-contour seats, auto-sensing lights and wipers, automatic high-beams, adjustable pedals, Blind Spot Information System (BLIS), and satellite navigation. Options from the Driver Assist option group, however, were unavailable simultaneously with the Performance Package. Those options include adaptive cruise control, collision warning system, Lane Keep Assist, and Active Park Assist.

===2013 facelift===
First revealed at the 2011 New York Auto Show, the Taurus received a mid-cycle refresh for the 2013 model year. The body featured a new front fascia and slightly updated rear fascia with LED taillamps, as well as all-new wheel options. The SHO model featured revised styling elements. Refinements were made to the 3.5 EcoBoost V6. Power in the 3.5L naturally-aspirated V6, standard in non-SHO models, was up to 288 hp. With this engine, EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings were 19 mpg city and 29 mpg highway in FWD models, and 18 mpg city and 26 mpg highway in AWD models. There was a new engine option for non-SHO models, a 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4 developing up to 240 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque while delivering a best-in-class 22 mpg city and 32 mpg highway. All models received upgrades to the steering and braking systems to improve driveability, including standard torque vectoring and curve control, improving tracking at higher speeds. Updates to the instrument dials were added, which were fully digital, clearer, and more colorful. MyFord Touch was added as part of Taurus&#x27;s Sync system.

===Discontinuation (North America)===
On April 25, 2018, Ford announced plans to discontinue the Taurus (along with the Fiesta, Focus, and Fusion), in order to focus more on its line of trucks and SUVs. The announcement was part of a plan by Ford Motor Company to cut costs and increase profits. This was in response to a shift in perceived consumer demand towards SUVs and pickup trucks, and away from sedans. On September 5, 2018, Ford ended all national and promotional advertising (including sales and special offers) for its entire sedan lineup, including the Taurus. On March 1, 2019, the last Ford Taurus built in the United States rolled off of the assembly line at the Ford Chicago plant. At its demise it cost $28,000.

==Seventh generation (2016)==

The seventh generation of the Ford Taurus was introduced at the 2015 Shanghai Auto Show. Unrelated to the previous six generations, the seventh generation was developed by Changan Ford in conjunction with Ford of Australia. Serving as the flagship of the Changan Ford joint venture, the Taurus is an extended-wheelbase variant of the Ford Fusion (Mondeo), differing primarily in its 3.9-inch longer wheelbase and formal rear roofline.

Manufactured since November 2015, Changan Ford produces its version of the Taurus in its Hangzhou facility. Produced solely for the Chinese market, there are currently no considerations towards export of the model line.

Derived from the Ford CD4 platform, the seventh-generation Taurus shares its platform architecture with the Ford Fusion and the Lincoln Continental. The standard engine is a 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4 (an option for the sixth-generation Taurus) and a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 (used in the Fusion and Lincoln Continental); a 6-speed automatic is paired to both engines. 

==Eighth generation (2023)==
The fifth-generation Ford Mondeo is marketed in GCC countries as the Ford Taurus, replacing the Chinese-sourced Taurus.

<text>The Havel () is a river in northeastern Germany, flowing through the states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Berlin and Saxony-Anhalt. The long Havel is a right tributary of the Elbe. However, the direct distance from its source to its mouth is only . For much of its length, the Havel is navigable; it provides an important link in the waterway connections between the east and west of Germany, as well as beyond.

==Source==
The source of the Havel is located in the Mecklenburg Lake District, between Lake Müritz and the city of Neubrandenburg. There is no obvious visible source in the form of a spring, but the river originates in the lakes in the Diekenbruch near Ankershagen, close to and south-east of the watershed between the North and Baltic seas. From there the river initially flows southward, eventually joining the Elbe, which in turn flows into the North Sea. Every river north-east of it flows to the Baltic Sea. The river enters Brandenburg near the town of Fürstenberg. In its upper course and between Berlin and Brandenburg an der Havel the river forms several lakes.

The Havel&#x27;s main tributary is the Spree, which joins the Havel in Spandau, a western borough of Berlin, and is longer and delivers more water than the Havel itself above the confluence. The second largest tributary is the Rhin, named in the Middle Ages by settlers from the lower Rhine. At the southern end of the Ruppiner See, weirs can distribute the waters of the Rhin either east- or westwards, rejoining the Havel in two places apart along a straight line, and more than apart along the course of the river.

The region around and north of the middle Havel is called the Havelland. It consists of sandy heights, sometimes called &quot;Ländchen&quot;, and low marshes, called &quot;luchs&quot;. A few kilometres of the river before its confluence with the Elbe near Havelberg are in the State of Saxony-Anhalt. Due to its minimal gradient it is susceptible to high waters in the Elbe.

Unless in extreme floods, if the dike of the Elbe is submerged, the discharge of the Havel is improved by the &quot;Gnevsdorfer Vorfluter&quot; (something like &quot;Gnevsdorfer outfall&quot;). By this canal, the mouth of the Havel, that naturally would be near Havelberg, is placed 11 km downstream. As the course of the Elbe has a higher gradient than the Havel, the water level of the Havel in Havelberg can be kept 1.4 metres below the Elbe (at the junction of the traverse communicating canal, protected by a lock).

Towns along the river include: Fürstenberg, Zehdenick, Oranienburg, Berlin, Potsdam, Werder, Ketzin, Brandenburg, Premnitz, Rathenow and Havelberg.

==History==
In earlier Greek or Latin sources, such as Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot;, the name of the river was also written as &quot;Habola, Habula, Havela&quot;. The river name Havel is related to German &quot;Haff, habe, hafen&quot;, MHG &quot;Hafen&quot; meaning port, harbor).

The Slavic people who later moved into the Havel area were referred to in German sources as Heveller (occasionally as Havolane).
==Navigation==

The Havel is navigable from the Mecklenburg Lake District to its confluence with the Elbe. Whilst its upper reaches carry little other than leisure traffic, further downstream it provides an important link in the German commercial waterway network, carrying traffic from the Rhine and the North Sea to Berlin and Poland.

From a navigation perspective, the Havel can be split into four sections with somewhat different characteristics and different administrative arrangements.

===Head of navigation to Liebenwalde===
The Havel is navigable to canoes and similar small craft from close to its source. Motor craft are prohibited above the first lock at , which links the Useriner See to the Großer Labussee. The stretch of the river between this lock and the junction with the Oder–Havel Canal is administered as part of the Obere–Havel–Wasserstraße, along with various connecting canals and waterways.

From Zwenzow downstream to Liebenwalde is a distance of . In this distance the navigation passes through the lakes of Großer Labussee, Woblitzsee, Wangnitzsee, Großer Priepertsee, Ellbogensee, Ziernsee, Röblinsee, Baalensee, Schwedtsee and Stolpsee. It also descends through the locks at Wesenberg, Steinhavelmühle, Fürstenberg, Bredereiche, Regow, Zaaren, Schorfheide, Zehdenick, Bischofswerder and Liebenwalde.

The Woblitzsee also gives access to the Kammer Canal, which allows vessels to reach Neustrelitz. The Ellbogensee links to the Müritz–Havel–Wasserstraße, which proceeds deeper into the Mecklenburg Lake District, eventually connecting with the Müritz–Elde–Wasserstraße. Other connected waterways are the , the and the Wentow Gewässer.

===Liebenwalde to Spandau===

The stretch of the river between the junction with the Oder–Havel Canal near Liebenwalde and the confluence with the Spree at Spandau is administered as part of the Havel–Oder–Wasserstraße, which also includes the Oder-Havel Canal. This stretch of the river forms part of the main inland waterway route from Germany to Poland and carries significant commercial traffic. This stretch of the river is long, and the river descends through two locks at and Spandau.

At Hennigsdorf, downstream of Liebenwalde, the Havel Canal joins the river on the west bank. This canal connects to Paretz, on the Havel downstream, and was built in the 1950s to allow East German vessels to avoid the stretch of the river under the political control of West Berlin. Some further downstream, the Berlin-Spandau Ship Canal joins the river on the east bank, providing a connection to central Berlin without passing through the lock at Spandau.

A car ferry crosses the river between Hakenfelde and Konradshöhe, in the Berlin boroughs of Spandau and Reinickendorf respectively.

The last of this stretch of the river, from Hennigsdorf, passes through a series of interconnected lakes, including the large Tegeler See. The river enters Berlin before Spandau, having formed the boundary for the previous . During the partition of Germany, this formed the border between East Germany and West Berlin, and border control points were established for vessels navigating the river.

===Spandau to Plaue===

The stretch of the river between the confluence with the Spree at Spandau and the junction with the Elbe–Havel Canal at Plaue is administered as part of the Lower Havel–Waterway, which also includes the stretch of river downstream to the confluence with the Elbe. Between Spandau and Plaue, the river forms part of the main inland waterway route from the Rhine and the west of Germany; from Hamburg and the North Sea ports, to both Berlin and Poland. It thus carries a considerable amount of commercial traffic.

South of Spandau, the river widens into a wide lake that extends, through some narrower areas, to Potsdam. On the east bank south of Spandau is the Grunewald with several beaches, among them the Großes Fenster (; literally &quot;Great Window&quot;) with an unobstructed view upriver, hence the name, followed by the island of Schwanenwerder and the large arm known as the Großer Wannsee. This part of the river can be very busy with leisure craft. The island of Pfaueninsel is also a feature of this stretch of the river. A public ferry crosses these waters between Wannsee and Kladow, carrying passengers and cyclists.

The Teltow Canal joins the river from the east via the Griebnitzsee just before the city reaches the city of Potsdam, providing an alternative route to the Oder–Spree Canal avoiding central Berlin. The Griebnitz Canal provides a short cut for smaller vessels from the Griebnitzsee to the Großer Wannsee.

At Potsdam the navigation splits into two channels. The Havel, here known as the Potsdamer Havel, takes a route southwest through Potsdam and the Templiner See to the Schwielowsee, then northwest to Paretz, whilst the Sacrow–Paretz Canal takes a shorter route due east to Paretz, saving some compared to the Potsdamer Havel. The Potsdamer Havel is crossed by the Kiewitt Ferry in Potsdam itself, and by the Caputh Ferry at the entrance to the Schweilowsee.
At Paretz the two channels join up again, as does the Havel Canal from further upstream. Just downstream of Paretz, the river is crossed by the Ketzin Cable Ferry. At Brandenburg an der Havel, the navigation again splits into two routes. Commercial shipping descends through a lock into the Silo Canal that passes to the north of the city centre. Leisure craft pass through the centre of the city, using the short Brandenburg City Canal, a smaller lock, then a stretch of the river. Both routes rejoin in the linked lakes of Breitling See and Plauer See, which leads up to Plaue.

===Plaue to Havelberg===

Like the preceding stretch of the river, the stretch from Plaue to the confluence with the Elbe at Havelberg is administered as part of the Lower Havel–Waterway. Unlike the previous stretch, this stretch carries considerably less commercial traffic.

Vessels heading to or from the Rhine and the west of Germany take the Elbe–Havel Canal at Plaue. Whilst the lower reaches of the Havel provide the most direct route to Hamburg and the North Sea ports, variable water levels in the Elbe affect those in the lower Havel; together these can restrict navigation. A less direct, but more reliable route is available via the Elbe–Havel Canal, the Magdeburg Water Bridge, the Mittelland Canal and the Elbe Lateral Canal.

This stretch of the river descends through locks at Bahnitz, Rathenow, Grütz, Garz and Havelberg. At Rathenow there are two channels, each with a lock. North of Plaue, the river is crossed by the Pritzerbe Ferry.

<text>Poland is a part of the global tourism market with constantly increasing number of visitors. Tourism in Poland contributes to the country&#x27;s overall economy. The most popular cities are Kraków, Warsaw, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Poznań, Szczecin, Lublin, Toruń, Zakopane, the Salt Mine in Wieliczka and the historic site of Auschwitz – a German Nazi concentration camp in Oświęcim. The best recreational destinations include Poland&#x27;s Masurian Lake District, Baltic Sea coast, Tatra Mountains (the highest mountain range of Carpathians), Sudetes and Białowieża Forest. Poland&#x27;s main tourist offers consist of sightseeing within cities, historical monuments, natural monuments, business trips, agrotourism, bicycle touring, qualified tourism, mountain hiking (trekking) and climbing among others.

==Overview==

In the 21st century, Poland is one of the safest countries in Europe, frequently visited by tourists.

Poland, especially after joining the European Union in 2004 and acceding to the Schengen Agreement in 2007, became a place frequently visited by tourists. Most tourist attractions in Poland are connected with natural environment, historic sites and cultural events.

According to Tourist Institute&#x27;s data, Poland was visited by 15.7 million tourists in 2006, and by 15 million tourists in 2007, out of the number of arrivals 66.2 million. In 2012, Poland was visited by 13.5 million foreign tourists (those who came during Euro 2012, but did not stay overnight, were not included in official statistics). In 2013, Poland was visited by 15.8 million tourists. In 2016, the number of arrivals to Poland amounted to 80.5 million. 17.5 million of this number are arrivals considered for tourism purposes (with at least one night&#x27;s stay). In 2019, Poland was visited by 21.4 million tourists, making it the 18th most visited country in the world.

==History==
The first Polish tourists were pilgrims traveling to shrines both within Poland and abroad. The development of commercial tourism began in the 19th century. The most popular regions were mountains, especially the Tatra Mountains, explored for example by Tytus Chałubiński. In 1873, the Polish Tatra Society and in 1909 the Polish Sightseeing Society were established to organize and develop tourism. The 19th century was also the time of the rapid appearance of spa resorts, mostly in Sudetes, Beskids and along the Baltic Sea coast, with some of them associated, since 1910, with the Polish Balneology Association. After Poland regained independence in 1918, Polish tourism boomed, and was encouraged by the government. The first professional Polish tour operator, Orbis, was founded in Lwów in 1923, followed in 1937 by Gromada tourist organization and tour operator.

After World War II all tourist organizations were nationalized by the new communist government. The Polish Tatra Society and Polish Sightseeing Society were combined into Polish Tourism-Sightseeing Society (PTTK) and most of the tourist infrastructure was handed over to the newly created Workers Vacations Fund (FWP). Tourism was limited to the Comecon countries. This was the era of governmentally-founded tourism, characterised by mass but low-standard tourism. A typical sight was a holiday campground with small bungalows managed by one of the state-owned companies. Holidays for children and teenagers were organized by Juventur.

After the fall of communism much of the infrastructure was privatized, although many company-owned resorts were downgraded because of their unprofitability. The early 1990s saw the foundation of many new tour operators. Some of them prevailed and strengthened their position on the market, being able to compete with multinational tour operators.

==Natural environment==

Poland has a diversified natural environment, which is relatively unaffected by human development. There are 23 national parks in the country that meet the criteria of the IUCN. Visitors are attracted by mountains, sea-coast with wide sandy beaches, and forests, lakes, rivers. Among the most popular destinations are: Tatra Mountains, in which is the highest peak of Poland (Rysy) and the famous Orla Perć (old trail in the style of via ferrata); Sudetes with Main Sudetes Trail (440 km from Świeradów Zdrój to Prudnik), Karkonosze, Table Mountains, Owl Mountains; Białowieża Forest, Lower Silesian Wilderness, Bieszczady, Dunajec River Gorge in Pieniny, Pojezierze Mazurskie and many others.

==Tourist resorts==

There are dozens of sea resorts on the coast of Baltic Sea like Wolin Island, located close to the German border and the coast of Pomerania. In southern Poland there are resorts for skiing and hiking in the Karkonosze mountains, which is part of the Sudetes mountain range. Karkonosze includes the tourist centres of Karpacz and Szklarska Poręba. Other famous resorts for skiing and hiking include in Carpathian Mountains: Zakopane in the Tatra mountains; Szczyrk, Krynica-Zdrój, Ustroń, Wisła in the Beskids or Szczawnica and Krościenko in Pieniny mountains.

In the vicinity of Low Beskids lies a tourist resort that offers a blend of mountainous terrain and an aqueous environment, with Lake Rożnów in the centre.

==Christian pilgrimage==

It&#x27;s estimated that 13% (of the 1.8 million in 2005) of visitors of the Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń arrive from abroad. Jasna Góra Monastery was visited by 3.6 million of pilgrims from 78 countries in 2014.

==Transport in Poland==
Tourist infrastructure and facilities are abundant, especially in larger cities and in major tourist resorts. In large Polish cities, urban public transport is very well developed.

The biggest cities (Kraków, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk and Szczecin) have international airports with connections with many European cities and with the Frédéric Chopin International Airport in Warsaw, which is the main hub of LOT Polish Airlines.

Intercity connections are offered by PKP Intercity, Polregio, Arriva RP, Leo Express, RegioJet, local trains (Koleje Dolnośląskie, Koleje Śląskie, Koleje Małopolskie, Szybka Kolej Miejska, Pomorska Kolej Metropolitalna, Koleje Mazowieckie, Łódzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna, Koleje Wielkopolskie) and PKS&#x27;s and many bus companies. There are also coach connections to other countries provided by various companies.

<text>The Spree ( , ; , , ; ; ; in Lower Sorbian also called &quot;Rěka&quot;) is a river in Germany and the Czech Republic. With a length of approximately , it is the main tributary of the Havel River. The Spree is much longer than the Havel, which it flows into at Berlin-Spandau; the Havel then flows into the Elbe at Havelberg. The river rises in the Lusatian Highlands, in the Lusatian part of Saxony, where it has three sources: the historical one called &quot;Spreeborn&quot; in the village of , the water-richest one in Neugersdorf, and the highest elevated one in Eibau. The Spree then flows northwards through Upper and Lower Lusatia, where it crosses the border between Saxony and Brandenburg. After passing through Cottbus, it forms the Spree Forest (), a large inland delta and biosphere reserve. It then flows through Lake Schwielochsee before entering Berlin, as 

The Spree is the main river of Berlin, Brandenburg, Lusatia, and the settlement area of the Sorbs, who call the river &quot;Sprjewja&quot;; the name derives ultimately from Proto-Germanic &quot;to spring forth&quot;. For a very short distance close to its sources, the Spree constitutes, as &quot;Spréva&quot;, the border between Germany and the Czech Republic. The Spree&#x27;s longest tributaries are Dahme (confluence in Berlin-Köpenick) and Schwarzer Schöps (&quot;Čorny Šepc&quot;; confluence in Boxberg/O.L.-), other well-known tributaries (since they are Berlin rivers) are Panke and Wuhle.

==Course==
It rises in the Lusatian Mountains and flows north through Bautzen and Spremberg.

In the Spreewald the river passes through the towns of Lübbenau, Lübben and Leibsch. Just below Leibsch, the Dahme Flood Relief Canal diverts water from the Spree to run into the River Dahme at Märkisch Buchholz. The Spree continues north from Leibsch before flowing into the Neuendorfer See at the northern edge of the Spreewald. From the Neundorfer See it then flows in an easterly direction to the Schwielochsee, and then in a northerly and westerly direction to the town of Fürstenwalde. From Fürstenwalde the river continues to flow westwards, through the Dämeritzsee and Müggelsee, to Köpenick in the southeastern part of Berlin, where it is joined by its tributary, the River Dahme.

The final reach of the Spree is where it is best known. It flows through the city centre of Berlin to join the River Havel in Spandau, one of Berlin&#x27;s western boroughs, which itself ultimately merges with the Elbe to enter the sea in Cuxhaven, after flowing through Hamburg. On its route through Berlin, the river passes Berlin Cathedral (&quot;Berliner Dom&quot;), the Reichstag and the Schloss Charlottenburg. The renowned Museum Island (&quot;Museumsinsel&quot;), with its collection of five major museums, is an island in the Spree.

In 2004 the Badeschiff floating swimming pool opened on the Spree in Berlin.

==Navigation==
Small craft, such as punts, are widely used in wetlands of the Spreewald. Larger craft can reach as far upstream as Leibsch, although the upper reaches are relatively shallow and are generally used only by leisure craft. Some intermediate reaches are unnavigable and by-passed by canals.

For a stretch of about east of and flowing through Fürstenwalde, the river forms part of the Oder-Spree Canal. On this reach, and on the reach west of the confluence with the River Dahme at Köpenick, the river forms part of secondary commercial link between Berlin and the River Oder and hence Poland. The canal diverges from the Spree just east of Fürstenwalde and later joins the River Dahme at the (lake) Seddinsee.

In Berlin, the Spree forms part of a dense network of navigable waterways, many of which are artificial, and which provide a wide choice of routes. Several important commercial harbors can be found on this network, and tugs and barges move sand, grain, bricks, and beer. Tour boats tour the central section of the Spree and its adjoining waterways on a frequent basis.

==Berlin Wall==

Many people died in the Spree during the Cold War while trying to cross the Berlin Wall, including children who drowned when rescuers were not allowed to enter the river to save them.

<doc id="159101" wikidata="Q606126" url="?curid=159101" title="Karpacz">
<text>Karpacz (, German: &quot;Krummhübel&quot;) is a spa town and ski resort in Jelenia Góra County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, south-western Poland, and one of the most important centres for mountain hiking and skiing, including ski jumping. Its population is about 4,500. Karpacz is situated in the Karkonosze Mountains – a resort with increasing importance for tourism as an alternative to the Alps.

Karpacz is located at above sea level. South of Karpacz on the border to the Czech Republic there is Mount Sněžka-Śnieżka (). Since 2020, the town has been hosting the annual international Economic Forum.

==History==
The first settlements in the area of Karpacz are noted by the official website of the city as being of probable Celtic origin and date to the 4th or 3rd century BC when they inhabited the region as part of gold-digging taking place in the area. The area was part of medieval Poland, after the establishment of the state in the 10th century. In the early 12th century the area was generally uninhabited, as mentioned in the oldest Polish chronicle &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot;. The first mention of permanent location within the current boundaries of the town is dated to the beginning of 15th century and connected to the destruction of a village called Broniów, whose inhabitants moved to settle the area currently located at the altitude of the town&#x27;s railway station.

The settlement was mentioned around the year 1599 because of lead and iron mining in the region. It was then part of the Habsburg-ruled Bohemian Crown. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, many Czech Protestants settled at the site of today&#x27;s town.

In 1742 it was annexed by Prussia and, subsequently, it was part of Germany between 1871 and 1945. Since the construction of the settlement&#x27;s first railway connection in 1895, its history was connected with the development of metallurgy industries and with the progress of tourism. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, in 1945 it became again part of Poland. In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the German population was expelled from the village between 1945 and 1947. The town was subsequently repopulated with Poles, who in turn were expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, and eventually renamed Karpacz in 1946. It was granted town rights in 1959.

==Tourist attractions==
In Karpacz Górny a gravity hill is located where bottles appear to roll uphill. There is also a Norwegian stave church, moved here from Vang, Norway in the mid-19th century. Tourists very often choose to go hiking on local mountain trails.

== People ==
* Max von Schenckendorff (1875-1943), German general in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Karpacz is twinned with:

<text>Harrachov (; ) is a town in Jablonec nad Nisou District in the Liberec Region of the Czech Republic, close to the border with Poland. It has about 1,400 inhabitants. It is known as one of the most popular Czech ski resorts.

==Administrative division==
Harrachov consists of four municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Harrachov (503)
*Mýtiny (16)
*Nový Svět (788)
*Ryžoviště (39)
==Geography==

Harrachov is located about east of Jablonec nad Nisou, on the border with Poland. It lies in the Giant Mountains. The highest point is the mountain Luboch at above sea level. Part of the municipal territory belongs to Krkonoše National Park.

The Mumlava River flows through the town. Its confluence with the Jizera is situated on the municipal border. On the Mumlava there is the Mumlava Waterfall, the biggest and one of the most famous waterfalls in the Czech Republic. It has a flow rate of 800 L/s and a height of .

===Climate===
==History==
Harrachov was established in the 17th century, after a glassworks was founded in the area of Ryžoviště, and originally was called just &quot;Dörf&quot; (German for &quot;little village&quot;). During the rule of Count Ferdinand Bonaventura Harrach (1701–1706), the settlement was renamed &quot;Harrachsdorf&quot; in his honor. The first written mention of Harrachov is from 1720. After a glassworks was founded also in the area of Nový Svět in 1711, the importance of Harrachov grew. The settlements of Nový Svět and Ryžoviště were founded around the glassworks in the mid-18th century. 

Since the end of the 19th century, Harrachov has been known for its glass production, textile industry, and mining. At the beginning of the 20th century, industrial production was bolstered by the construction of a cog railway line between Bohemian Tanvald via the Izera railway down to Silesian &quot;Hirschberg&quot; (present-day Jelenia Góra).

After World War II, the Silesian lands in the north fell to the Polish People&#x27;s Republic according to the Potsdam Agreement and the border was closed. The German population was expelled and its property seized according to the Beneš decrees.

In 1958, the Communist governments of Czechoslovakia and Poland arranged a territorial exchange. Since the railway station located here was unusable for Poland after the interruption of cross-border traffic (the line to Jelenia Góra returned to Czechoslovak territory in a short section) and the local small settlements were almost inaccessible from the Polish side, the territories was exchanged. Czechoslovakia acquired the area around former &quot;Strickerhäuser&quot; (, present-day Mýtiny). Poland was compensated by land in western Giant Mountains. In this way Harrachov acquired a railway station.

In 1921, the originally independent municipalities of Nový Svět and Rýžoviště joined Harrachov. In 1961, Mýtiny joined Harrachov.

From 1 January 2021, Harrachov is no longer a part of Semily District and belongs to Jablonec nad Nisou District.

==Demographics==
==Transport==

The I/10 road (part of the European route E65 from Prague) passes through the town.

Harrachov is located on the railway line from Liberec to Szklarska Poręba.

There are three borders crossings with Poland: the railway crossing &quot;Harrachov / Jakuszyce&quot;, the road border crossing &quot;Harrachov / Jakuszyce&quot;, and the pedestrian border crossing &quot;Harrachov / Polana Jakuszycka&quot;.

==Sport==
Harrachov is one of the most popular Czech ski resorts including the internationally used Čerťák ski jumping hill (including flying hill); several winter sport events take place in Harrachov regularly. The whole region is increasingly important for alpine tourism in Central Europe.

==Sights==

The most valuable building is the glass factory, founded in 1712. It is one of the longest-running glassworks in Bohemia that still uses most of the uniquely preserved historical machinery, which makes it an important technical monument. Its best-preserved part is the grinding plant, which is protected as a national cultural monument.

The main landmark of Harrachov is the Church of Saint Wenceslaus. It was built in the Neoclassical style in 1822–1828, on the site of a chapel from 1730 and a wooden church from 1788. The local glass factory took part in the decoration. The interior is equipped with a glass altar.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Harrachov is twinned with:

<text>Fylingdales is a civil parish in North Yorkshire, England situated south of Whitby, within the North York Moors National Park. It contains the villages of Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay and Fylingthorpe and Fyling Hall School.

According to the 2011 UK census, Fylingdales parish had a population of 1,346, a reduction on the 2001 UK census figure of 1,485.

==History==
Now similar to Fyllingsdalen, Fylingdales was recorded as Figclinge in the 11th century, Figelinge, Figelingam and Fielinge in the 11th and 12th centuries and possibly as Saxeby in the 12th century. The name derives from &quot;Fygla&#x27;s people.&quot; It was a parochial chapelry south of Whitby and contained the villages of Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay and Thorpe, or Fylingthorpe (which was recorded as Prestethorpe in the 13th century) and the hamlets of Normanby, Parkgate, Ramsdale, Raw (Fyling Rawe, 16th century) and Stoupe Brow. The church, dedicated to St Stephen replaced an ancient chapel which had Saxon origins and was demolished in about 1821 and was a dependent chapel of Whitby Abbey.

Fyling Old Hall is in Fylingthorpe not far from the Fyling Beck and was leased by the abbey in 1539. It is built in sandstone with a slate roof and mullioned windows. Sir Hugh Cholmley sold Fyling Hall in 1634 to Sir John Hotham whose descendants held the estate including the hall and mill until the 18th century.

The moor within the parishes of Fylingdales and Hawsker-cum-Stainsacre is managed by the ancient Manor of Fyling Court Leet. Courts Leet can be traced to Norman times, and the Manor of Fyling Court Leet was mentioned and recognised in the Administration of Justices Act 1977 to continue to transact the &quot;Management of the Commons in the Manor&quot;.

==Geography==
The area of Fylingdales is of land and inland water. The chief crops grown were barley and oats but most of the land was in pasture or moorland. The cliffs are Upper Lias shale capped by Dogger and False Bedded Sandstones and shales of the Lower Oolite. The height varies from to above the ordnance datum on the cliffs to on the moors. Alum was worked at Stoupe Brow and Peak. There were brick and tile-works at High Normanby and at Quarry Hill, Raw.

The moorland has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is managed by the Manor Court.

===Climate===
During a prolonged period of heavy rain across England in September 2024, Fylingdales saw its September monthly average of of rain falling in just two days.

==RAF Fylingdales==
The Tri-Partite site known as RAF Fylingdales is named after the place but is not actually in the parish. Originally planned to be built on a site at Grouse Hill within Fylingdales, the site was moved due to coastal erosion concerns, and the name was not changed as it was preferable to being called RAF Snod Hill (Snod Hill is where it is actually located) and it sits at the western edge of Fylingdales Moor.

== Sport ==
Fylingdales Cricket Club is in Middlewood Lane, about one kilometre south east of Fylingthorpe village. The club have two senior teams: a Saturday 1st XI that compete in the Scarborough Beckett Cricket League, a Midweek Senior XI in the Esk Valley Evening League and a junior section that compete in the Derwent Valley Junior Cricket League.

<doc id="159104" wikidata="Q32832" url="?curid=159104" title="Battle of Varna">
<text>The Battle of Varna took place on 10 November 1444 near Varna in what is today eastern Bulgaria. The Ottoman army under Sultan Murad II (who did not actually rule the sultanate at the time) defeated the Crusaders commanded by King Władysław III of Poland and Hungary, John Hunyadi (acting as commander of the combined Christian forces) and Mircea II of Wallachia. It was the final battle of the unsuccessful Crusade of Varna, a last-ditch effort to prevent further Ottoman expansion into the Balkans.

==Background==
The Hungarian Kingdom fell into crisis after the death of King Sigismund in 1437. His son-in-law and successor, King Albert, ruled for only two years and died in 1439, leaving his widow Elizabeth with an unborn child, Ladislaus the Posthumous. The Hungarian noblemen then called the young King Władysław III of Poland to the throne of Hungary, expecting his aid in defense against the Ottomans. After his Hungarian coronation, he never went back to his homeland again, assuming rule of the Hungarian Kingdom next to the influential nobleman John Hunyadi.

After failed expeditions in 1440–1442 against Belgrade and Transylvania and the defeats of the Turks during Hunyadi&#x27;s &quot;long campaign&quot; in 1442–1443, the Ottoman sultan Murad II signed a ten-year truce with Hungary. After he had made peace with the Karaman Emirate in Anatolia in August 1444, he resigned the throne to his twelve-year-old son Mehmed II.

Cesarini insisted that the Hungarian King Władysław III should break the treaty, arguing that it was not valid due to the fact that it had been made with infidels. Hungary co-operated with Venice and Pope Eugene IV to organize a new crusader army led by Hunyadi and Władysław III. On receipt of this news, Çandarlı Halil Pasha recalled Murad II against the Christian Coalition, even though Mehmed II did not accept this and wanted to fight himself. As a result, Murad II commanded the Ottoman army.

==Preparations==
The mixed Papal army was composed mainly of Hungarian, Polish, Bohemian (whose combined armies numbered 16,000) and Wallachian (4,000) forces, with smaller detachments of papal troops, Teutonic Knights, Bosnians, Croats, Bulgarians, Lithuanians, and Ruthenians. Troops from Croatia and Bosnia were led by Croatian nobleman Franko Talovac.

Papal, Venetian and Burgundian ships under Alvise Loredan had blockaded the Dardanelles as the Hungarian army was to advance on Varna, while a second flotilla comprising six ships (two Burgundian, two Ragusan and two Byzantine) blockaded the Bosphorus. Both failed, and the main Ottoman force from Asia, including the sultan, crossed the Bosphorus on 18 October 1444. The Hungarian advance was rapid, Ottoman fortresses were bypassed, while local Bulgarians from Vidin, Oryahovo, and Nicopolis joined the army (Fruzhin, son of Ivan Shishman, also participated in the campaign with his own guard). On 10 October near Nicopolis, some 7,000 Wallachian cavalrymen under Mircea II, one of Vlad Dracul&#x27;s sons, also joined.

Armenian refugees in the Kingdom of Hungary also took part in the wars of their new country against the Ottomans as early as the battle of Varna in 1444, when some Armenians were seen amongst the Christian forces.

==Deployment==

Late on November 9, a large Ottoman army of around 40.000 or 60,000 men approached Varna from the west. At a supreme military council called by Hunyadi during the night, the papal legate, cardinal Julian Cesarini, insisted on a quick withdrawal. However, the Christians were caught between the Black Sea, Lake Varna, the steep wooded slopes of the Franga Plateau (356 m high), and the enemy. Cesarini then proposed a defense using the Wagenburg of the Hussites until the arrival of the Christian fleet. The Hungarian magnates and the Croatian and Czech commanders backed him, but the young (20-year-old) Władysław and Hunyadi rejected the defensive tactics. Hunyadi declared: &quot;To escape is impossible, to surrender is unthinkable. Let us fight with bravery and honor our arms.&quot; Władysław accepted this position and gave him the command. Andreas del Palatio states that Hunyadi commanded the &quot;Wallachian army&quot; indicating a large Romanian component in Hunyadi&#x27;s personal army.

In the morning of 10 November, Hunyadi deployed the army of some 20,000 crusaders as an arc between Lake Varna and the Franga plateau; the line was about 3.5 km long. Two banners with a total of 3,500 men from the king&#x27;s Polish and Hungarian bodyguards, Hungarian royal mercenaries, and banners of Hungarian nobles held the center. The Wallachian cavalry was left in reserve behind the center.

The right flank that lined up the hill towards the village of Kamenar numbered 6,500 men in 5 banners. Dalmatian John de Dominis, Bishop of Varadin with his personal banner led the force; Cesarini commanded a banner of German mercenaries and a Bosnian one. The Bishop of Eger Simon Rozgonyi led his own banner, and the military governor of Slavonia, ban Franko Talovac, commanded one Croatian banner.

The left flank, a total of 5,000 men in 5 banners, was led by Michael Szilágyi, Hunyadi&#x27;s brother in law, and was made up of Hunyadi&#x27;s Transylvanians, Bulgarians, German mercenaries and banners of Hungarian magnates. Behind the Hungarians, closer to the Black Sea and the lake, was the Wagenburg, defended by 300 or 600 Czech and Ruthenian mercenaries under hetman Ceyka, along with Poles, Lithuanians and Wallachians. Every wagon was crewed with 7 to 10 soldiers and the Wagenburg was equipped with bombards.

The Ottoman center included the Janissaries and levies from Rumelia deployed around two Thracian burial mounds. Murad observed and directed the battle from one of them. The Janissaries dug in behind ditches and two palisades. The right wing consisted of Kapikulus and Sipahis from Rumelia, and the left wing was made up by Akıncıs, Sipahis from Anatolia, and other forces. Janissary archers and Akıncı light cavalry were deployed on the Franga plateau.

==Battle==

The light Ottoman cavalry assaulted the Croats of ban Franco Talotsi. Christians from the left riposted with bombards and firearms and stopped the attack. Christian soldiers chased the Ottomans in a disorderly pursuit. The Anatolian cavalry ambushed them from the flank. The Christian right wing attempted to flee to the small fortress of Galata on the other side of Varna Bay, but most of them were slain in the marshland around Varna Lake and the River Devnya, where Cesarini also met his end. Only ban Talotsi&#x27;s troops managed to withdraw behind the Wagenburg.
The other Ottoman flank assaulted the Hungarians and Bulgarians of Michael Szilagyi. Their push was stopped and turned back; then Sipahis attacked again. Hunyadi decided to help and advised Władysław to wait until he returned; then advanced with two cavalry companies. The young king, ignoring Hunyadi&#x27;s advice, rushed 500 of his Polish knights against the Ottoman center. They attempted to overrun the Janissary infantry and take Murad prisoner, and almost succeeded, but in front of Murad&#x27;s tent Władysław&#x27;s horse either fell into a trap or was stabbed, and the king was beheaded by mercenary Kodja Hazar. The remaining coalition cavalry were demoralized and defeated by the Ottomans.

On his return, Hunyadi tried frantically to salvage the king&#x27;s body, but all he could accomplish was to organize the retreat of the remains of his army; it suffered thousands of casualties in the chaos, and was virtually annihilated. Neither the head nor body of the king were ever found. The minnesinger Michael Beheim wrote a song based on the story of Hans Mergest, who spent 16 years in Ottoman captivity after the battle.

==Aftermath==

Hunyadi reached the Danube but was captured by Vlad Dracul in Wallachia and imprisoned as insurance in case of Ottoman retaliation or for a high ransom. He was released in exchange for a large amount of money when Hungarian nobles loyal to Hunyadi began to threaten Vlad Dracul with a campaign against him. Another version of the story is that he was mistakenly captured by Wallachian border guards, who didn&#x27;t recognize him, and released by Vlad Dracul once they met face to face. After the death of Władysław III, Hunyadi became one of the most important and powerful members of the Hungarian nobility, becoming the Governor of Hungary on 5 June 1446. He was later made a Duke by the Pope in 1447.

Hungarian nobles found it hard to believe that both their king and Cesarini had died, leading to spies being sent south of the Danube, but no information was found other than what was already known. 

The death of Władysław III left Hungary in the hands of the four-year-old Ladislaus Posthumous of Bohemia and Hungary. He was succeeded in Poland by Casimir IV Jagiellon after a three-year interregnum.

Murad&#x27;s casualties at Varna were so heavy, it was not until three days later that he realized he was victorious. Nevertheless, the Ottoman victory in Varna, followed by the Ottoman victory in the Second Battle of Kosovo in 1448, deterred the European states from sending any substantial military assistance to the Byzantines during the Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1453. Hunyadi signed a three-year truce with the Ottoman central government in 1451.

Only the European victory at Belgrade would stop the Ottomans from conquering large parts of Europe. Hungary would be safe for another 70 years after this victory until the Hungarian army was crushed by the Ottomans at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, which would lead to the end of Hungary as an independent united kingdom for almost 400 years.

==Legacy==
In the aftermath, the Ottomans had removed a significant opposition to their expansion into central and eastern Europe; subsequent battles forced a large number of Europeans to become Ottoman subjects.

The fallen Polish king was named Ladislaus of Varna (&quot;Władysław III Warneńczyk&quot;) in memory of the battle.

The Battle of Varna is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;WARNA 10 XI 1444&quot;.

The &quot;Rise of the Ottomans&quot; bookmark of the grand strategy game &quot;Europa Universalis IV&quot; is intentionally set one day after the battle.

<text>II &amp; III is a 1986 album by musical group Camper Van Beethoven, released on Pitch-a-Tent and Rough Trade. It was the band&#x27;s second album.

After releasing their debut album, original drummer Anthony Guess left the band, and guitarist Greg Lisher joined. With the band temporarily lacking a drummer, guitarist Chris Molla played many of the drum parts on &quot;II &amp; III&quot;. As the album was being finished, they finally found a permanent replacement for Guess with Chris Pedersen, who ended up playing on only one song, &quot;We&#x27;re a Bad Trip&quot;.

The album also found violinist/multi-instrumentalist Jonathan Segel singing lead vocals for the first time, on the tracks &quot;Chain of Circumstance&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re a Bad Trip&quot;, the latter which featured him and Lowery trading verses.

&quot;II &amp; III&quot; found the band already moving past the mixture of faux ethnic instrumentals and absurdist folk-pop-punk tunes of their debut album, for an even more eclectic sound, including elements of Americana, psychedelia, and Middle-Eastern music. Molla played steel guitar on some songs, and Segel played mandolin, adding to the country influences. There are relatively fewer instrumentals, with the vocal songs taking on many of the ethnic elements that were contained on the debut album&#x27;s instrumental numbers.

It contains several notable songs, especially &quot;Sad Lovers Waltz&quot;, a slow alt-country number that did much to dispel the band&#x27;s then-image as a novelty band. Another Americana-style song was a bluegrass-influenced cover of &quot;I Love Her All the Time&quot; by Sonic Youth, which continued the band&#x27;s traditions of doing countrified versions of punk and alternative songs.

The song &quot;Circles&quot; bears a close resemblance to &quot;Oh No!&quot; from &quot;Telephone Free Landslide Victory&quot;: the former features the same chords as the latter but reversed, and has slower verses.

<text>Shrewsbury is an unincorporated community in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States, along the Mississippi River and Shrewsbury Road about 1 mile upriver from the border of the city of New Orleans. The name came into use in the mid-19th century, and became less commonly used towards the end of the 20th century, when surrounding communities of unincorporated Jefferson grew together as a suburb of New Orleans. The area is now generally known as Old Jefferson and is part of the Greater New Orleans Metropolitan area.

During the early 20th century, Shrewsbury Road was an official link in the Jefferson Highway (State Route 1, and later U.S. Route 61) and provided the main automobile route into New Orleans via Metairie Road. It faded in importance as new and more direct routes into the city were constructed, namely the extensions of Jefferson Highway (1928) and Airline Highway (1940) into South Claiborne Avenue and Tulane Avenue, respectively. The final blow came in June 1957 when the railroad crossing on Shrewsbury Road was closed following completion of the nearby Causeway Boulevard overpass, leaving the once prominent road discontinuous.

In 1915 Shrewsbury was connected to New Orleans by two streetcar lines. The first was the Orleans-Kenner interurban line (popularly known as the O-K Line), which provided service between Kenner and downtown New Orleans along the Jefferson Highway/Claiborne Avenue corridor. The second was an extension of the Napoleon Avenue streetcar line completed in 1915 with service along Metairie Road to Shrewsbury Road. The O-K Line was discontinued in 1930, and the Napoleon Avenue streetcar was cut back in 1934 and replaced by the Metairie bus line.

In 1917 the Jefferson Park Race Track was opened near the intersection of Jefferson Highway and Shrewsbury Road and was a favorite horse racing venue for many years. The site was converted into the Jefferson Park residential subdivision in 1948.

The area is also home to the Camp Parapet Powder Magazine, one of the last remnants of the American Civil War in the New Orleans area.

Shrewsbury is referred to in the rhythm and blues song &quot;Shrewsbury Blues&quot;, written by Dave Bartholomew and recorded by Tommy Ridgeley, a native of the area.

<text>Camper Van Beethoven is a 1986 album by musical group Camper Van Beethoven, released on Pitch-A-Tent. With the six then CVB members joined in the studio by acid-folk eccentric Eugene Chadbourne, the album is arguably the zenith of the band&#x27;s musical experimentation, with surreal lyrics, backwards, sped-up and slowed down parts; a portion of the track &quot;Stairway To Heavan&quot; (sic) is itself a musical palindrome. A great number of ethnic instruments are used in addition to the usual violin parts played by member Jonathan Segel; the album also features pedal steel, banjo, tablas and sitar.

While the album features the band&#x27;s trademark absurdist lyrics by leader David Lowery and Segel, with CVB staples like affectionate parodies of counterculture and references to drugs and alien abduction, it also features some satirical political lyrics and social commentary on tracks like &quot;Good Guys and Bad Guys&quot;, &quot;Joe Stalin&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; and &quot;We Love You&quot;&#x27;.

The songs cover a bewildering range of musical styles: garage punk on &quot;Shut Us Down&quot;&#x27;, acid-rock jamming on the Pink Floyd cover &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, bluegrass jamming on &quot;Hoe Yourself Down&quot;, folk-ska on &quot;Good Guys and Bad Guys&quot;, gentle tabla beats on &quot;Une Fois&quot; and &quot;Folly&quot;, psychedelic pop on &quot;We Saw Jerry&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, ominous desert-rock spoken word on &quot;Peace and Love&quot; and grinding raga-rock on &quot;Stairway to Heavan&quot; (sic). While earlier CVB albums had featured influences of Eastern European and Mexican musical styles, this album has more noticeable elements of Indian and Arabic musics, done in the usual irreverent Camper style. These combine with the elements of psychedelic music that dominate the album. There are also more elements of Americana than on their previous albums. The American Southwest looms large in the music and lyrics as well, especially on songs like &quot;The History of Utah&quot; and &quot;Peace and Love&quot;.

There are a number of classic rock references too: &quot;We Saw Jerry&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is a parody of Deadheads; &quot;Stairway to Heavan&quot;, &quot;Five Sticks&quot; and &quot;Joe Stalin&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; all contain song titles or lyrics modified from Led Zeppelin; and the cover of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; and several of the album&#x27;s songs are reminiscent of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd. &quot;We Love You&quot; also contains a parody of the Charlie Daniels Band song &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;. In the original &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;, the Devil was portrayed as a negative being who is defeated in a fiddle-playing contest by the song&#x27;s protagonist, but in &quot;We Love You&quot;, the devil, presumably Jonathan Segel, so impresses the band with his violin playing that they allow him to become a band member. The classic-rock influences are a contrast from their first two albums, which contained covers of other contemporary underground bands like Sonic Youth and Black Flag.

A number of the album&#x27;s tracks remain staples of the reunited Camper Van Beethoven&#x27;s live sets, including &quot;Good Guys and Bad Guys&quot;, &quot;The History of Utah&quot;, &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; and &quot;Shut Us Down&quot;.

In an Oct. 4, 2010, entry on Lowery&#x27;s &quot;300 Songs&quot; blog, devoted to explaining the genesis and meaning behind the songs he has written throughout his career, the band&#x27;s leader claimed that this album had a hidden title, concealed in the liner notes and etched onto initial vinyl pressings: &quot;Soviet Spies Swim Upstream Disguised as Trout.&quot; Lowery wrote that this title was inspired by &quot;an obsessive fan that would write us nearly everyday.&quot;

The Ziggens&#x27; song &quot;I Got Me a Girlfriend&quot; is partially a cover of &quot;Joe Stalin&#x27;s Cadillac.&quot;

<text>Nuclear terrorism is the use of a nuclear weapon as an act of terrorism (i.e., illegal use of violence for a political or religious cause). There are many possible terror incidents, ranging in feasibility and scope. These include the sabotage of a nuclear facility, the intentional irradiation of citizens, or the detonation of a radiological device, colloquially termed a dirty bomb, but consensus is lacking. According to the 2005 United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism nuclear terrorism is an offense committed if a person unlawfully and intentionally &quot;uses in any way radioactive material … with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or with the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the environment; or with the intent to compel a natural or legal person, an international organization or a State to do or refrain from doing an act.&quot;

The possibility of terrorist organizations using nuclear weapons has been identified by nuclear powers and considered since the conception of nuclear weapons and the rise of global terrorism. Nuclear powers collaborate to prevent terror organizations from acquiring nuclear weapons and fuel.

It is considered plausible that terrorists could acquire a nuclear weapon. As such, countries such as China and the UK have taken steps to restrict access to nuclear weapons and materials. Restrictions being implemented are only a small part of prevention systems that are being researched in countries. Preventing nuclear terrorism is a topic that interests countries who are developing or expanding their nuclear warhead knowledge. Whether it be through policy, summits, or warhead detection and disablement, the idea of threatening another nation is a worry that comes with the notion of war. Nonetheless, despite thefts and trafficking of small amounts of fissile material, there is no credible evidence that any terrorist group has ever obtained or produced nuclear materials of sufficient quantity or purity to produce a viable nuclear weapon.

==Scope==

Nuclear terrorism could include:
* Acquiring or fabricating a nuclear weapon
* Fabricating a dirty bomb
* Attacking a nuclear reactor, e.g., by disrupting critical inputs (e.g. water supply)
* Attacking or taking over a nuclear-armed submarine, plane, or base.

Nuclear terrorism, according to a 2011 report published by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, can be executed and distinguished via four pathways:
*The use of a nuclear weapon that has been stolen or purchased on the black market
*The use of a crude explosive device built by terrorists or by nuclear scientists who the terrorist organization has furtively recruited
*The use of an explosive device constructed by terrorists and their accomplices using their own fissile material
*The acquisition of fissile material from a nation-state.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama called nuclear terrorism &quot;the single most important national security threat that we face&quot;. In his first speech to the U.N. Security Council, President Obama stated that &quot;Just one nuclear weapon exploded in a city—be it New York or Moscow, Tokyo or Beijing, London or Paris—could kill hundreds of thousands of people&quot;, and warned such an attack could &quot;destabilize our security, our economies, and our very way of life&quot;.

==History==
As early as December 1945, politicians worried about the possibility of smuggling nuclear weapons into the United States, though this was still in the context of a battle between the superpowers of the Cold War. Congressmen quizzed the &quot;father of the atomic bomb,&quot; J. Robert Oppenheimer, about the possibility of detecting a smuggled atomic bomb:

 This sparked further work on the question of smuggled atomic devices during the 1950s.

Discussions of non-state nuclear terrorism among experts go back at least to the 1970s. In 1975 &quot;The Economist&quot; warned that &quot;You can make a bomb with a few pounds of plutonium. By the mid-1980s the power stations may easily be turning out 200,000 lb of the stuff each year. And each year, unless present methods are drastically changed, many thousands of pounds of it will be transferred from one plant to another as it proceeds through the fuel cycle. The dangers of robbery in transit are evident... Vigorous co-operation between governments and the International Atomic Energy Agency could, even at this late stage, make the looming perils loom a good deal smaller.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented in 1981 that The Nuclear Emergency Search Team&#x27;s &quot;origins go back to the aftershocks of the Munich Olympic massacre in mid-1972. Until that time, no one in the United States Government had thought seriously about the menace of organized, international terrorism, much less nuclear terrorism. There was a perception in Washington that the value of what is called &#x27;special nuclear material&#x27; - plutonium or highly enriched uranium (HEU) - was so enormous that the strict financial accountability of the private contractors who dealt with it would be enough to protect it from falling into the wrong hands. But it has since been revealed that the physical safeguarding of bomb-grade material against theft was almost scandalously neglected.&quot;

This discussion took on a larger public character in the 1980s after NBC aired &quot;Special Bulletin&quot;, a television dramatization of a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States. In 1986 a private panel of experts known as the International Task Force on the Prevention of Terrorism released a report urging all nuclear-armed states to beware the dangers of terrorism and work on equipping their nuclear arsenals with permissive action links. &quot;The probability of nuclear terrorism,&quot; the experts warned, &quot;is increasing and the consequences for urban and industrial societies could be catastrophic.&quot;

== Acquisition ==
Nuclear weapons may be acquired by non-state organisations such as terrorist groups via purchase or theft, either in whole or in part, from state entities. State involvement may be either intentional—as an act of policy—or inadvertent—through failure to exercise sovereignty within their territory over nuclear weapons or materials with which to build them. Robert Litwak, vice-president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, deemed it unlikely that terrorist groups would be able to effectively create nuclear weapons without enriched uranium. Nevertheless, he speculated that ISIS&#x27;s control over much of Syria and Iraq, and therefore much of their infrastructure, could lead to them developing &quot;state-like WMD (weapons of mass destruction) capabilities&quot;. Litwak therefore stated that the United States&#x27;s primary strategy had been to curtail ISIS&#x27;s territorial gains to deny them the capabilities of a state.

== Prevention ==

Unlike state-level use of nuclear weapons, retaliation is not likely to deter terrorist groups from the use of nuclear weapons, so the doctrine of mutually assured destruction does not apply. 

Denial of access to nuclear materials is thus the approach taken by interested nations. Techniques include import and export restrictions, physical security at nuclear facilities to prevent theft, and consolidation or elimination of stockpiles to reduce the security perimeter. The United States subsidizes security for nuclear materials and dismantlement of nuclear weapons through the Cooperative Threat Reduction and Global Threat Reduction Initiative programs.

Different countries have their own proposals for how to secure nuclear materials. In China, during 2020 there was a proposal for security measures to be developed surrounding radioactive material transportation. Similarly, the UK had an approach in 2021. A UK review was published surrounding the use of radiation detection systems with shipping container cargo, and how future systems should be designed as to implement improved detection technologies without negatively impacting the shipping industry.

Efforts to secure nuclear materials are also made by threatening to punish any country that uses, sells, or gives away nuclear weapons or materials. One example of this is when U.S. President George W. Bush threatened North Korea with consequences if they were to engage in such behavior.

=== Organizations to combat nuclear terrorism ===
The Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) is an international partnership of 88 nations and 5 official observers working to improve capacity on a national and international level for prevention, detection, and response to a nuclear terrorist event. Partners join the GICNT by endorsing the Statement of Principles, a set of broad nuclear security objectives. GICNT partner nations organize and host workshops, conferences, and exercises to share best practices for implementing the Statement of Principles. The GICNT also holds Plenary meetings to discuss improvements and changes to the partnership.

The World Institute for Nuclear Security is an organization which seeks to prevent nuclear terrorism and improve world nuclear security. It works alongside the International Atomic Energy Agency. WINS was formed in 2008, less than a year after a break-in at the Pelindaba nuclear facility in South Africa, which contained enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs.

==Militant groups==
Nuclear weapons materials on the black market are a global concern, and there is concern about the possible detonation of a small, crude nuclear weapon by a militant group in a major city, with significant loss of life and property.

It is feared that a terrorist group could detonate a dirty bomb, a type of radiological weapon. A dirty bomb is made of any radioactive source and a conventional explosive. There would be no nuclear blast and likely no fatalities, but the radioactive material is dispersed and can cause extensive fallout depending on the material used. There are other radiological weapons called radiological exposure devices where an explosive is not necessary. A radiological weapon may be very appealing to terrorist groups as it is highly successful in instilling fear and panic among a population (particularly because of the threat of radiation poisoning) and would contaminate the immediate area for some period of time, disrupting attempts to repair the damage and subsequently inflicting significant economic losses.

===Al-Qaeda===
From its foundation in 1988, al-Qaeda had a military subcommittee on nuclear weapons and tried to purchase fissile material from former Soviet Union and its former satellite states. After al-Qaeda merged with Ayman al-Zawahiri&#x27;s Egyptian Islamic Jihad the new Shura Council held internal discussions on nuclear weapons, and in 1998 Osama bin Laden issued a fatwa declaring that it was his religious duty to acquire and use nuclear weapons. Al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl told the FBI that bin Laden paid a Sudanese Armed Forces general $1.5 million for a cylinder of cinnabar which he believed contained South African uranium in 1993. In April 2001, a Bulgarian businessman claimed bin Laden offered to buy fissile material from him in a meeting near the China-Pakistan border.

In bin Laden&#x27;s only interview with a journalist after the September 11 attacks, he and al-Zawahiri claimed that al-Qaeda possessed readily usable chemical and nuclear weapons. It is generally believed, including by the interviewer Hamid Mir, that they were bluffing and that it would have been extremely unlikely for al-Qaeda to have procured weapons of mass destruction at that time.

According to &quot;Bunn &amp; Wier&quot;, bin Laden requested a ruling (a fatwa), and was subsequently informed via a cleric of Saudi Arabia during 2003, of it being in accordance with Islamic law for him to use a nuclear device against civilians if it was the only course of action available to him in a situation of defending Muslims against the actions of the U.S. military.

According to leaked diplomatic documents, al-Qaeda can produce radiological weapons, after sourcing nuclear material and recruiting rogue scientists to build &quot;dirty bombs&quot;. Al-Qaeda, along with some North Caucasus terrorist groups that seek to establish an Islamic Caliphate in Russia, have consistently stated they seek nuclear weapons and have tried to acquire them. Al-Qaeda has sought nuclear weapons for almost two decades by attempting to purchase stolen nuclear material and weapons and has sought nuclear expertise on numerous occasions. Osama bin Laden stated that the acquisition of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction is a “religious duty.” While pressure from a wide range of counter-terrorist activity has hampered Al-Qaeda&#x27;s ability to manage such a complex project, there is no sign that it has jettisoned its goals of acquiring fissile material. Statements made as recently as 2008 indicate that Al-Qaeda&#x27;s nuclear ambitions are still very strong. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism issued a report that al-Qaeda would attempt to use.

===Islamic State===
The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has demonstrated ambition to use weapons of mass destruction. Although the chances of them obtaining a nuclear bomb are small, the group has been trying/suspected of trying to obtain a nuclear dirty bomb. In July 2014, after the fall of Mosul, ISIS militants captured nuclear materials from Mosul University. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Iraq&#x27;s UN Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim said that the materials had been kept at the university and &quot;can be used in manufacturing weapons of mass destruction&quot;. International Atomic Energy Agency spokeswoman Gill Tudor said that the seized materials were &quot;low grade and would not present a significant safety, security or nuclear proliferation risk&quot;.

In October 2015, it was reported that Moldovan authorities working with the FBI had stopped four attempts from 2010 to 2015 by gangs with suspected connections to Russia&#x27;s intelligence services that sought to sell radioactive material to ISIS and other Middle Eastern extremists. The last reported case came in February 2015 when a smuggler with a large amount of radioactive caesium specifically sought a buyer from ISIS. Due to poor relations between Russia and the West, it is difficult to ascertain if smugglers succeeded in selling radioactive material originating from Russia to Islamist terrorists and elsewhere.

In March 2016, it was reported that a senior Belgian nuclear official was being monitored by ISIS suspects linked to the November 2015 Paris attacks leading the Belgian Federal Agency for Nuclear Control to suspect that ISIS was planning on abducting the official to obtain nuclear materials for a dirty bomb.

In April 2016, European Union and NATO security chiefs warned that ISIS was plotting to carry out nuclear attacks on the United Kingdom and Europe.

===North Caucasus terrorists===
North Caucasus terrorists have attempted to seize a nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine. They have also engaged in reconnaissance activities on nuclear storage facilities and have repeatedly threatened to sabotage nuclear facilities. Similar to Al-Qaeda, these groups’ activities have been hampered by counter-terrorism activity; nevertheless they remain committed to launching such a devastating attack within Russia.

===Aum Shinrikyo===
The Japanese terror cult Aum Shinrikyo, which used sarin gas in the 1995 Tokyo Metro attack, has also tried to acquire nuclear weapons. However, according to nuclear terrorism researchers at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, there is no evidence as of 2011 that they continue to do so.

==Incidents involving nuclear material ==
Information reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) shows &quot;a persistent problem with the illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials, thefts, losses and other unauthorized activities&quot;. The IAEA Illicit Nuclear Trafficking Database notes 1,266 incidents reported by 99 countries over the last 12 years, including 18 incidents involving HEU or plutonium trafficking:

*There have been 18 incidents of theft or loss of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium confirmed by the IAEA.
*British academic Shaun Gregory alleged in 2009 that terrorists had attacked Pakistani nuclear facilities three times; twice in 2007 and once in 2008. However, the then Director General ISPR Athar Abbas said the claims were &quot;factually incorrect&quot;, adding that the sites were &quot;military facilities, not nuclear installations&quot;.
*In November 2007, burglars with unknown intentions infiltrated the Pelindaba nuclear research facility near Pretoria, South Africa. The burglars escaped without acquiring any of the uranium held at the facility.
*In June 2007, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released to the press the name of Adnan Gulshair el Shukrijumah, allegedly the operations leader for developing tactical plans for detonating nuclear bombs in several American cities simultaneously.
*In November 2006, MI5 warned that al-Qaida were planning on using nuclear weapons against cities in the United Kingdom by obtaining the bombs via clandestine means.
*In February 2006, Oleg Khinsagov of Russia was arrested in Georgia, along with three Georgian accomplices, with 79.5 grams of 89 percent HEU.
*In November 2006, the Alexander Litvinenko poisoning with radioactive polonium &quot;represents an ominous landmark: the beginning of an era of nuclear terrorism,&quot; according to Andrew J. Patterson.
*In June 2002, U.S. citizen José Padilla was arrested for allegedly planning a radiological attack on the city of Chicago; however, he was never charged with such conduct. He was instead convicted of charges that he conspired to &quot;murder, kidnap and maim&quot; people overseas.

==By country==
=== Pakistan ===
In 2009, a paper published in West Point Military Academy&#x27;s journal alleged that Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear sites had been attacked by al-Qaeda and the Taliban at least three times. The Pakistan Armed Forces rejected the allegations. Talat Masood, a political analyst, said that the nuclear link was &quot;absolute nonsense&quot;. All three attacks were suicide and appeared to aim at causing maximum damage and not seizing weapons. In January 2010, it was revealed that the US army was training a specialised unit &quot;to seal off and snatch back&quot; Pakistani nuclear weapons in the event that militants would obtain a nuclear device or materials that could make one. Pakistan supposedly possesses about 160+ nuclear warheads. US officials refused to speak on the record about the American safety plans.

A study by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University titled &quot;Securing the Bomb 2010,&quot; found that Pakistan&#x27;s stockpile &quot;faces a greater threat from Islamic terror groups seeking nuclear weapons than any other nuclear stockpile on earth.&quot; In 2016, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Vincent R. Stewart said that Pakistan &quot;continues to take steps to improve its nuclear security, and is aware of the threat presented by extremists to its program&quot;.

According to Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former investigator with the CIA and the U.S. Department of Energy, there is &quot;a greater possibility of a nuclear meltdown in Pakistan than anywhere else in the world. The region has more violent extremists than any other, the country is unstable, and its arsenal of nuclear weapons is expanding.&quot; In 2015, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the US has confidence that Pakistan is &quot;well aware of the range of potential threats to its nuclear arsenal&quot;. He added that the US is &quot;confident that Pakistan has a professional and dedicated security force that understands the importance and the high priority that the world places on nuclear security&quot;.

Nuclear weapons expert David Albright and author of &quot;Peddling Peril&quot; has also expressed concerns that Pakistan&#x27;s stockpile may not be secure despite assurances by both Pakistan and U.S. government. He stated that Pakistan &quot;has had many leaks from its program of classified information and sensitive nuclear equipment, and so you have to worry that it could be acquired in Pakistan&quot;. In 2015, Richard G. Olson, former US Ambassador to Pakistan, expressed confidence in the capabilities of the Pakistani security forces to control and secure its nuclear weapons. He added that Islamabad has &quot;specifically taken into account the insider threat&quot;.

A 2016 study by the Congressional Research Service titled &#x27;Pakistan&#x27;s Nuclear Weapons&#x27;, noted that Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;initiatives, such as strengthened export control laws, improved personnel security, and international nuclear security cooperation programs, have improved Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear security&quot;.

=== Azerbaijan ===
During the 2020 Armenian–Azerbaijani skirmishes Azerbaijan threatened to launch missile attacks on the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant.

=== Iran ===

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Nuclear Protection and Security Corps is responsible for securing the Iranian nuclear program from terrorists.

=== Russia ===
The assassination of Alexander Litvinenko by Russian state agents in 2006 using the radioactive polonium was described as the beginning of an era of nuclear terrorism.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian troops engaged in the Battle of Enerhodar began shelling the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on March 3, 2022. Units 2 and 3 were put into an emergency safe mode, while Unit 4 remained in operation due to being the furthest from the artillery firing range. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had warned that potential damage from a Russian attack would be &quot;ten times larger than Chernobyl&quot;. The attack caused significant damage to the plant, including a fire breaking out near Unit 1, which was under maintenance at the time. The fire was contained in the following morning. The attack was condemned by many within the international community, including being described as nuclear terrorism by Lithuanian President Nauseda, &quot;incredible reckless and dangerous&quot; by US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and a war crime by Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg.

In August 2022 Dmitry Medvedev published a comment warning that &quot;accidents can happen at European nuclear plants too&quot;, which was widely interpreted as a concealed threat.

=== United States ===
While in office, President Barack Obama reviewed Homeland Security policy and concluded that &quot;attacks using improvised nuclear devices ... pose a serious and increasing national security risk&quot;. In their presidential contest, President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry both agreed that the most serious danger facing the United States is the possibility that terrorists could obtain a nuclear bomb. Most nuclear-weapon analysts agree that &quot;building such a device would pose few technological challenges to reasonably competent terrorists&quot;. The main barrier is acquiring highly enriched uranium.

In 2004, Graham Allison, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Clinton administration, wrote that “on the current path, a nuclear terrorist attack on America in the decade ahead is more likely than not&quot;. In 2004, Bruce Blair, president of the Center for Defense Information stated: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if nuclear weapons are used over the next 15 or 20 years, first and foremost by a terrorist group that gets its hands on a Russian nuclear weapon or a Pakistani nuclear weapon&quot;. In 2006, Robert Galluccii, Dean of the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, estimated that, “it is more likely than not that al-Qaeda or one of its affiliates will detonate a nuclear weapon in a U.S. city within the next five to ten years.&quot; Despite a number of claims, there is no credible evidence that any terrorist group has yet succeeded in obtaining a nuclear bomb or the materials needed to make one.

Detonation of a nuclear weapon in a major U.S. city could kill more than 500,000 people and cause more than a trillion dollars in damage. Hundreds of thousands could die from fallout, the resulting fires and collapsing buildings. In this scenario, uncontrolled fires would burn for days and emergency services and hospitals would be completely overwhelmed. The likely socio-economic consequences in the United States outside the immediate vicinity of an attack, and possibly in other countries, would also likely be far-reaching. A Rand Corporation report speculates that there may be an exodus from other urban centers by populations fearful of another nuclear attack.

The Obama administration claimed to focus on reducing the risk of high-consequence, non-traditional nuclear threats. Nuclear security was thought to be strengthened by enhancing &quot;nuclear detection architecture and ensuring that our own nuclear materials are secure,&quot; and by &quot;establishing well-planned, well-rehearsed, plans for co-ordinated response.&quot; According to senior Pentagon officials, the United States will make &quot;thwarting nuclear-armed terrorists a central aim of American strategic nuclear planning.&quot; Nuclear attribution is another strategy being pursued to counter terrorism. Led by the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, attribution would allow the government to determine the likely source of nuclear material used in the event of a nuclear attack. This would prevent terrorist groups, and any states willing to help them, from being able to pull off a covert attack without assurance of retaliation.

In July 2010 medical personnel from the U.S. Army practiced the techniques they would use to treat people injured by an atomic blast. The exercises were carried out at a training center in Indiana, and were set up to &quot;simulate the aftermath of a small nuclear bomb blast, set off in a U.S. city by terrorists.&quot;

&quot;Stuxnet&quot; is a computer worm discovered in June 2010 that is believed to have been created by the United States and Israel to attack the nuclear facilities of Iran and North Korea.

==== Nuclear power plants ====
After 9/11, nuclear power plants were to be prepared for an attack by a large, well-armed terrorist group. But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in revising its security rules, decided not to require that plants be able to defend themselves against groups carrying sophisticated weapons. According to a study by the Government Accountability Office, the N.R.C. appeared to have based its revised rules &quot;on what the industry considered reasonable and feasible to defend against rather than on an assessment of the terrorist threat itself&quot;. If terrorist groups could sufficiently damage safety systems to cause a core meltdown at a nuclear power plant, and/or sufficiently damage spent fuel pools, such an attack could lead to widespread radioactive contamination. The Federation of American Scientists have said that if nuclear power use is to expand significantly, nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the community. New reactor designs have features of passive safety, which may help. In the United States, the NRC carries out &quot;Force on Force&quot; (FOF) exercises at all Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) sites at least once every three years.

The peace group Plowshares have shown how nuclear weapons facilities can be penetrated, and the groups actions represent extraordinary breaches of security at nuclear weapons plants in the United States. The National Nuclear Security Administration has acknowledged the seriousness of the 2012 Plowshares action. Non-proliferation policy experts have questioned &quot;the use of private contractors to provide security at facilities that manufacture and store the government&#x27;s most dangerous military material&quot;.

==== Hoaxes ====
In late 1974, President Gerald Ford was warned that the FBI received a communication from an extortionist wanting $200,000 ($ today) after claiming that a nuclear weapon had been placed somewhere in Boston. A team of experts rushed in from the United States Atomic Energy Commission but their radiation detection gear arrived at a different airport. Federal officials then rented a fleet of vans to carry concealed radiation detectors around the city but forgot to bring the tools they needed to install the equipment. The incident was later found to be a hoax. However, the government&#x27;s response made clear the need for an agency capable of effectively responding to such threats in the future. Later that year, President Ford created the Nuclear Emergency Search Team (NEST), which under the Atomic Energy Act is tasked with investigating the &quot;illegal use of nuclear materials within the United States, including terrorist threats involving the use of special nuclear materials&quot;.

One of its first responses by the Nuclear Emergency Search/Support Team was in Spokane, Washington on November 23, 1976. An unknown group called the &quot;Days of Omega&quot; had mailed an extortion threat claiming it would explode radioactive containers of water all over the city unless paid $500,000 ($ today). Presumably, the radioactive containers had been stolen from the Hanford Site, less than 150 miles to the southwest. Immediately, NEST flew in a support aircraft from Las Vegas and began searching for non-natural radiation, but found nothing. No one ever responded despite the elaborate instructions given, or made any attempt to claim the (fake) money which was kept under surveillance. Within days, the incident was deemed a hoax, though the case was never solved. To avoid panic, the public was not notified until a few years later.

==Policy landscape==

===Recovery===
The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR), which is also known as the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction, is a 1992 law sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar. The CTR established a program that gave the U.S. Department of Defense a direct stake in securing loose fissile material inside the since-dissolved Soviet Union. According to Graham Allison, director of Harvard University&#x27;s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, this law is a major reason why not a single nuclear weapon has been discovered outside the control of Russia&#x27;s nuclear custodians. The Belfer Center is itself running the &quot;Project on Managing the Atom,&quot; Matthew Bunn is a co-principal investigator of the project, Martin B. Malin is its executive director (circa. 2014).

In August 2002, the United States launched a program to track and secure enriched uranium from 24 Soviet-style reactors in 16 countries, in order to reduce the risk of the materials falling into the hands of terrorists or &quot;rogue states&quot;. The first such operation was &quot;Project Vinca&quot;, &quot;a multinational, public-private effort to remove nuclear material from a poorly-secured Yugoslav research institute.&quot; The project has been hailed as &quot;a nonproliferation success story&quot; with the &quot;potential to inform broader &#x27;global cleanout&#x27; efforts to address one of the weakest links in the nuclear nonproliferation chain: insufficiently secured civilian nuclear research facilities.&quot;

In 2004, the U.S. Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) was established in order to consolidate nuclear stockpiles of highly enriched uranium (HEU), plutonium, and assemble nuclear weapons at fewer locations. Additionally, the GTRI converted HEU fuels to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuels, which has prevented their use in making a nuclear bomb within a short amount of time. HEU that has not been converted to LEU has been shipped back to secure sites, while amplified security measures have taken hold around vulnerable nuclear facilities.

===Options===
Robert Gallucci, President of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, argues that traditional deterrence is not an effective approach toward terrorist groups bent on causing a nuclear catastrophe. Henry Kissinger, stating the wide availability of nuclear weapons makes deterrence “decreasingly effective and increasingly hazardous.” Preventive strategies, which advocate the elimination of an enemy before it is able to mount an attack, are risky and controversial, therefore difficult to implement. Gallucci believes that “the United States should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence, which focuses not on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them. By threatening retaliation against those states, the United States may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent.”.

Graham Allison makes a similar case, arguing that the key to expanded deterrence is coming up with ways of tracing nuclear material to the country that forged the fissile material. “After a nuclear bomb detonates, nuclear forensic cops would collect debris samples and send them to a laboratory for radiological analysis. By identifying unique attributes of the fissile material, including its impurities and contaminants, one could trace the path back to its origin.” The process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints. “The goal would be twofold: first, to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons; second, to give every leader the incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials.”

===Nuclear skeptics===
John Mueller, a scholar of international relations at the Ohio State University, is a prominent nuclear skeptic. He makes three claims: (1) the nuclear intent and capability of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda has been “fundamentally exaggerated;” (2) “the likelihood a terrorist group will come up with an atomic bomb seems to be vanishingly small;” and (3) policymakers are guilty of an “atomic obsession” that has led to “substantively counterproductive” policies premised on “worst case fantasies.” In his book &quot;Atomic Obsession&quot;: &quot;Nuclear Alarmism from Hiroshima to Al-Qaeda&quot; he argues that: &quot;anxieties about terrorists obtaining nuclear weapons are essentially baseless: a host of practical and organizational difficulties make their likelihood of success almost vanishingly small&quot;.

Intelligence officials have pushed back, testifying before Congress that the inability to recognize the shifting modus operandi of terrorist groups was part of the reason why members of Aum Shinrikyo, for example, were “not on anybody’s radar screen.” Matthew Bunn, associate professor at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, argues that “Theft of HEU and plutonium is not a hypothetical worry, it is an ongoing reality.&quot; Almost all of the stolen HEU and plutonium that has been seized over the years had never been missed before it was seized. The IAEA Illicit Nuclear Trafficking Database notes 1,266 incidents reported by 99 countries over the last 12 years, including 18 incidents involving HEU or plutonium trafficking.

Keir Lieber and Daryl Press argue that despite the prominent U.S. focus on nuclear terrorism, &quot;the fear of terrorist transfer [of nuclear weapons] seems greatly exaggerated... [and] the dangers of a state giving nuclear weapons to terrorists have been overstated.&quot; A decade of terrorism statistics show a strong correlation between attack fatalities and the attribution of the attack, and Lieber and Press assert that &quot;neither a terror group nor a state sponsor would remain anonymous after a nuclear terror attack.&quot; About 75 percent of attacks with 100 or more fatalities were traced to the culprits; also, 97 percent of attacks on U.S. soil or that of a major ally (resulting in 10 or more deaths) were attributed to the guilty party. Lieber and Press conclude that the lack of anonymity would deter a state from providing terrorist groups with nuclear weapons.

The use of HEU and plutonium in satellites has raised the concern that a sufficiently motivated rogue state could retrieve materials from a satellite crash (notably on land as occurred with Kosmos-954, Mars-96 and Fobos-Grunt) and then use these to supplement the yield of an already working nuclear device. This has been discussed recently in the UN and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team regularly consults with Roscosmos and NASA about satellite re-entries that may have contained such materials. As yet no parts were verifiably recovered from Mars 96 but recent WikiLeaks releases suggest that one of the &quot;cells&quot; may have been recovered by mountain climbers in Chile.

===Security summits===
On April 12–13, 2010, President of the United States Barack Obama initiated and hosted the first-ever nuclear security summit in Washington D.C., commonly known as the Washington Nuclear Security Summit. The goal was to strengthen international cooperation to prevent nuclear terrorism. President Obama, along with nearly fifty world leaders, discussed the threat of nuclear terrorism, what steps needed to be taken to mitigate illicit nuclear trafficking, and how to secure nuclear material. The Summit was successful in that it produced a consensus delineating nuclear terrorism as a serious threat to all nations. Finally, the Summit produced over four-dozen specific actions embodied in commitments by individual countries and the Joint Work Plan. However, world leaders at the Summit failed to agree on baseline protections for weapons-usable material, and no agreement was reached on ending the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in civil nuclear functions. Many of the shortcomings of the Washington Nuclear Security Summit were addressed at the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit in March 2012, including a focus on nuclear detection.

According to Graham Allison, director of Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, the objectives of the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul are to continue to, “assess the progress made since the Washington Summit and propose additional cooperation measures to (1) Combat the threat of nuclear terrorism, (2) protect nuclear materials and related facilities, and (3) prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.&quot;

==Media coverage==
In 2011, the British news agency, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Telegraph&quot;, received leaked documents regarding the Guantanamo Bay interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The documents cited Khalid saying that, if Osama bin Laden is captured or killed by the Coalition of the Willing, an al-Qaeda sleeper cell will detonate a &quot;weapon of mass destruction&quot; in a &quot;secret location&quot; in Europe, and promised it would be &quot;a nuclear hellstorm&quot;. No such attack occurred after the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011.

<doc id="159114" wikidata="Q1335777" url="?curid=159114" title="Stamp Act 1765">
<text>The Stamp Act 1765, also known as the Duties in American Colonies Act 1765 (5 Geo. 3. c. 12), was an act of the Parliament of Great Britain which imposed a direct tax on the British colonies in America and required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper from London which included an embossed revenue stamp. Printed materials included legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers, and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies, and it had to be paid in British currency, not in colonial paper money.

The purpose of the tax was to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the French and Indian War, but the colonists had never feared a French invasion to begin with, and they contended that they had already paid their share of the war expenses. Colonists suggested that it was actually a matter of British patronage to surplus British officers and career soldiers who should be paid by London.

The Stamp Act 1765 was very unpopular among colonists. A majority considered it a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent—consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant. Their slogan was &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;. Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests, and the Stamp Act Congress held in New York City was the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure when it petitioned Parliament and the King.

One member of the British Parliament argued that the American colonists were no different from the 90-percent of Great Britain who did not own property and thus could not vote, but who were nevertheless &quot;virtually&quot; represented by land-owning electors and representatives who had common interests with them. Daniel Dulany, a Maryland attorney and politician, disputed this assertion in a widely read pamphlet, arguing that the relations between the Americans and the English electors were &quot;a knot too infirm to be relied on&quot; for proper representation, &quot;virtual&quot; or otherwise. Local protest groups established Committees of Correspondence which created a loose coalition from New England to Maryland. Protests and demonstrations increased, often initiated by the Sons of Liberty and occasionally involving hanging of effigies. Very soon, all stamp tax distributors were intimidated into resigning their commissions, and the tax was never effectively collected.

Opposition to the Stamp Act 1765 was not limited to the colonies. British merchants and manufacturers pressured Parliament because their exports to the colonies were threatened by boycotts. The act was repealed on 18 March 1766 as a matter of expedience, but Parliament affirmed its power to legislate for the colonies &quot;in all cases whatsoever&quot; by also passing the Declaratory Act 1766. A series of new taxes and regulations then ensued—likewise opposed by the Americans. The episode played a major role in defining the 27 colonial grievances that were clearly stated within the text of the &quot;Indictment of George III&quot; section of the United States Declaration of Independence, enabling the organized colonial resistance which led to the American Revolution in 1775. 

==Background==
The British victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), known in the United States and elsewhere as the French and Indian War, was won at great financial expense. During the war, the British national debt nearly doubled, rising from £72,289,673 in 1755 to almost £129,586,789 by 1764. Post-war expenses were expected to remain high because the Bute ministry decided in early 1763 to keep ten thousand British regulars in the American colonies, which would cost about £225,000 per year, equal to £ million today. The primary reason for retaining such a large force was that demobilizing the army would put 1,500 officers out of work, many of whom were well-connected in Parliament. This made it politically prudent to retain a large peacetime establishment, but Britons were averse to maintaining a standing army at home so it was necessary to garrison most of the troops elsewhere.

The outbreak of Pontiac&#x27;s War in May 1763 led to the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the added duty of British soldiers to prevent outbreaks of violence between Native Americans and American colonists. 10,000 British troops were dispatched to the American frontier, with a primary motivation of the move being to provide billets for the officers who were part of the British patronage system. John Adams wrote disparagingly of the deployment, writing that &quot;Revenue is still demanded from America, and appropriated to the maintenance of swarms of officers and pensioners in idleness and luxury&quot;.

George Grenville became prime minister in April 1763 after the failure of the short-lived Bute Ministry, and he had to find a way to pay for this large peacetime army. Raising taxes in Britain was out of the question, since there had been virulent protests in England against the Bute ministry&#x27;s 1763 cider tax, with Bute being hanged in effigy. The Grenville ministry, therefore, decided that Parliament would raise this revenue by taxing the American colonists without their consent. This was something new; Parliament had previously passed measures to regulate trade in the colonies, but it had never before directly taxed the colonies to raise revenue.

Politicians in London had always expected American colonists to contribute to the cost of their own defence. So long as a French threat existed, there was little trouble convincing colonial legislatures to provide assistance. Such help was normally provided through the raising of colonial militias, which were funded by taxes raised by colonial legislatures. Also, the legislatures were sometimes willing to help maintain regular British units defending the colonies. So long as this sort of help was forthcoming, there was little reason for the British Parliament to impose its own taxes on the colonists. But after the peace of 1763, colonial militias were quickly stood down. Militia officers were tired of the disdain shown to them by regular British officers, and were frustrated by the near-impossibility of obtaining regular British commissions; they were unwilling to remain in service once the war was over. In any case, they had no military role, as the Indian threat was minimal and there was no foreign threat. Colonial legislators saw no need for the British troops.

The Sugar Act 1764 was the first tax in Grenville&#x27;s program to raise a revenue in America, which was a modification of the Molasses Act 1733. The Molasses Act 1733 had imposed a tax of 6 pence per gallon (equal to £ today) on foreign molasses imported into British colonies. The purpose of the Molasses Act 1733 was not actually to raise revenue, but instead to make foreign molasses so expensive that it effectively gave a monopoly to molasses imported from the British West Indies. It did not work; colonial merchants avoided the tax by smuggling or, more often, bribing customs officials. The Sugar Act 1764 reduced the tax to 3 pence per gallon (equal to £ today) in the hope that the lower rate would increase compliance and thus increase the amount of tax collected. The act also taxed additional imports and included measures to make the customs service more effective.

American colonists initially objected to the Sugar Act 1764 for economic reasons, but before long they recognized that there were potential constitutional issues involved. The British Constitution guaranteed that taxes could not be levied without the consent of Parliament, but the colonists argued that due to their theoretical Rights as Englishmen, they could not be taxed without their consent, which came in the form of representation in Parliament. The colonists elected no members of Parliament, and so it was seen as a violation of their rights for Parliament to tax them. There was little time to raise this issue in response to the Sugar Act 1764, but it came to be a major objection to the Stamp Act 1765 the following year.

=== British decision-making ===
Parliament announced in April 1764 when the Sugar Act 1764 was passed that they would also consider a stamp tax in the colonies. Opposition from the colonies was soon forthcoming to this possible tax, but neither members of Parliament nor American agents in Great Britain (such as Benjamin Franklin) anticipated the intensity of the protest that the tax generated.

Stamp acts had been a very successful method of taxation within Great Britain; they generated over £100,000 in tax revenue with very little in collection expenses. By requiring an official stamp on most legal documents, the system was almost self-regulating; a document would be null and void under British law without the required stamp. Imposition of such a tax on the colonies had been considered twice before the Seven Years&#x27; War and once again in 1761. Grenville had actually been presented with drafts of colonial stamp acts in September and October 1763, but the proposals lacked the specific knowledge of colonial affairs to adequately describe the documents subject to the stamp. At the time of the passage of the Sugar Act in April 1764, Grenville made it clear that the right to tax the colonies was not in question, and that additional taxes might follow, including a stamp tax.

The Glorious Revolution had established the principle of parliamentary supremacy. Control of colonial trade and manufactures extended this principle across the ocean. This belief had never been tested on the issue of colonial taxation, but the British assumed that the interests of the thirteen colonies were so disparate that a joint colonial action was unlikely to occur against such a tax–an assumption that had its genesis in the failure of the Albany Conference in 1754. By the end of December 1764, the first warnings of serious colonial opposition were provided by pamphlets and petitions from the colonies protesting both the Sugar Act 1764 and the proposed stamp tax.

For Grenville, the first issue was the amount of the tax. Soon after his announcement of the possibility of a tax, he had told American agents that he was not opposed to the Americans suggesting an alternative way of raising the money themselves. However, the only other alternative would be to requisition each colony and allow them to determine how to raise their share. This had never worked before, even during the French and Indian War, and there was no political mechanism in place that would have ensured the success of such cooperation. On 2 February 1765, Grenville met to discuss the tax with Benjamin Franklin, Jared Ingersoll from New Haven, Richard Jackson, agent for Connecticut, and Charles Garth, the agent for South Carolina (Jackson and Garth were also members of Parliament). These colonial representatives had no specific alternative to present; they simply suggested that the determination be left to the colonies. Grenville replied that he wanted to raise the money &quot;by means the most easy and least objectionable to the Colonies&quot;. Thomas Whately had drafted the Stamp Act, and he said that the delay in implementation had been &quot;out of Tenderness to the colonies&quot;, and that the tax was judged as &quot;the easiest, the most equal and the most certain.&quot;

The debate in Parliament began soon after this meeting. Petitions submitted by the colonies were officially ignored by Parliament. In the debate, Charles Townshend said, 

This led to Colonel Isaac Barré&#x27;s response:

Massachusetts Royal Governor William Shirley assured London in 1755 that American independence could easily be defeated by force. He argued:
== The act ==
The act was passed by the British Parliament on 22 March 1765 with an effective date of 1 November 1765. It passed 205–49 in the House of Commons and unanimously in the House of Lords. Historians Edmund and Helen Morgan describe the specifics of the tax:

The high taxes on lawyers and college students were designed to limit the growth of a professional class in the colonies. The stamps had to be purchased with hard currency, which was scarce, rather than the more plentiful colonial paper currency. To avoid draining currency out of the colonies, the revenues were to be expended in America, especially for supplies and salaries of British Army units who were stationed there.

Two features of the act involving the courts attracted special attention. The tax on court documents specifically included courts &quot;exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction.&quot; These type of courts did not currently exist in the colonies and no bishops were currently assigned to the colonies, who would preside over the courts. Many colonists or their ancestors had fled England specifically to escape the influence and power of such state-sanctioned religious institutions, and they feared that this was the first step to reinstating the old ways in the colonies. Some Anglicans in the northern colonies were already openly advocating the appointment of such bishops, but they were opposed by both southern Anglicans and the non-Anglicans who made up the majority in the northern colonies.

The act allowed admiralty courts to have jurisdiction for trying violators, following the example established by the Sugar Act. However, admiralty courts had traditionally been limited to cases involving the high seas. The Sugar Act seemed to fall within this precedent, but the Stamp Act did not, and the colonists saw this as a further attempt to replace their local courts with courts controlled by England.

==Reactions==
As the act imposed a tax on many different types of paper items, including newspapers, contracts, deeds, wills, claims, indentures and many other types of legal documents, its effect would be felt in many different professions and trades, resulting in wide spread protests from newspapers, citizens, and even attacks on public officials, tax collectors and their offices and homes.

===Political responses===
Grenville started appointing stamp distributors almost immediately after the act passed Parliament. Applicants were not hard to come by because of the anticipated income that the positions promised, and he appointed local colonists to the post. Benjamin Franklin even suggested the appointment of John Hughes as the agent for Pennsylvania, indicating that even Franklin was not aware of the turmoil and impact that the tax was going to generate on American-British relations or that these distributors would become the focus of colonial resistance.

Debate in the colonies had actually begun in the spring of 1764 over the Stamp Act when Parliament passed a resolution that contained the assertion, &quot;That, towards further defraying the said Expences, it may be proper to charge certain Stamp Duties in the said Colonies and Plantations.&quot; Both the Sugar Act and the proposed Stamp Act were designed principally to raise revenue from the colonists. The Sugar Act, to a large extent, was a continuation of past legislation related primarily to the regulation of trade (termed an external tax), but its stated purpose was entirely new: to collect revenue directly from the colonists for a specific purpose. The novelty of the Stamp Act was that it was the first internal tax (a tax based entirely on activities within the colonies) levied directly on the colonies by Parliament. It was judged by the colonists to be a more dangerous assault on their rights than the Sugar Act 1764 was, because of its potential wide application to the colonial economy.

The theoretical issue that soon held center stage was the matter of taxation without representation. Benjamin Franklin had raised this as far back as 1754 at the Albany Congress when he wrote, &quot;That it is suppos&#x27;d an undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own Consent given thro&#x27; their Representatives. That the Colonies have no Representatives in Parliament.&quot; The counter to this argument was the theory of virtual representation. Thomas Whately enunciated this theory in a pamphlet that readily acknowledged that there could be no taxation without consent, but the facts were that at least 75% of British adult males were not represented in Parliament because of property qualifications or other factors. Members of Parliament were bound to represent the interests of all British citizens and subjects, so colonists were the recipients of virtual representation in Parliament, like those disenfranchised subjects in the British Isles. This theory, however, ignored a crucial difference between the unrepresented in Britain and the colonists. The colonists enjoyed actual representation in their own legislative assemblies, and the issue was whether these legislatures, rather than Parliament, were in fact the sole recipients of the colonists&#x27; consent with regard to taxation.

In May 1764, Samuel Adams of Boston drafted the following that stated the common American position:

Massachusetts appointed a five-member Committee of Correspondence in June 1764 to coordinate action and exchange information regarding the Sugar Act, and Rhode Island formed a similar committee in October 1764. This attempt at unified action represented a significant step forward in colonial unity and cooperation. The Virginia House of Burgesses sent a protest of the taxes to London in December 1764, arguing that they did not have the specie required to pay the tax. Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut also sent protest to England in 1764. The content of the messages varied, but they all emphasized that taxation of the colonies without colonial assent was a violation of their rights. By the end of 1765, all of the Thirteen Colonies except Georgia and North Carolina had sent some sort of protest passed by colonial legislative assemblies.

The Virginia House of Burgesses reconvened in early May 1765 after news was received of the passage of the act. By the end of May, it appeared that they would not consider the tax, and many legislators went home, including George Washington. Only 30 out of 116 Burgesses remained, but one of those remaining was Patrick Henry who was attending his first session. Henry led the opposition to the Stamp Act; he proposed his resolutions on 29 May 1765, and they were passed in the form of the Virginia Resolves. The Resolves stated:

On 6 June 1765, the Massachusetts Lower House proposed a meeting for the 1st Tuesday of October in New York City:

There was no attempt to keep this meeting a secret; Massachusetts promptly notified Richard Jackson of the proposed meeting, their agent in England and a member of Parliament.

===Colonial newspapers===


John Adams complained that the London ministry was intentionally trying &quot;to strip us in a great measure of the means of knowledge, by loading the Press, the colleges, and even an Almanack and a News-Paper, with restraints and duties.&quot; The press fought back. By 1760 the fledgling American newspaper industry comprised 24 weekly papers in major cities. Benjamin Franklin had created an informal network so that each one routinely reprinted news, editorials, letters and essays from the others, thus helping form a common American voice. All the editors were annoyed at the new stamp tax they would have to pay on each copy. By informing colonists what the other colonies were saying the press became a powerful opposition force to the Stamp Act. Many circumvented it and most equated taxation without representation with despotism and tyranny, thus providing a common vocabulary of protest for the Thirteen Colonies.

The August 1, 1768, issue of the Pennsylvania Chronicle, established by William Goddard, printed on the front page a four-column article of an address made at the State House (Independence Hall) against the Stamp Act, and other excessive tax laws passed without colonial representation in the British Parliament.

The newspapers reported effigy hangings and stamp master resignation speeches. Some newspapers were on the royal payroll and supported the act, but most of the press was free and vocal. Thus William Bradford, the foremost printer in Philadelphia, became a leader of the Sons of Liberty. He added a skull and crossbones with the words, &quot;the fatal Stamp,&quot; to the masthead of his &quot;Pennsylvania Journal and weekly Advertiser&quot;.

Some of the earliest forms of American propaganda appeared in these printings in response to the law. The articles written in colonial newspapers were particularly critical of the act because of the Stamp Act&#x27;s disproportionate effect on printers. David Ramsay, a patriot and historian from South Carolina, wrote of this phenomenon shortly after the American Revolution:

Most printers were critical of the Stamp Act, although a few Loyalist voices did exist. Some of the more subtle Loyalist sentiments can be seen in publications such as &quot;The Boston Evening Post&quot;, which was run by British sympathizers John and Thomas Fleet. The article detailed a violent protest that occurred in New York in December, 1765, then described the riot&#x27;s participants as &quot;imperfect&quot; and labeled the group&#x27;s ideas as &quot;contrary to the general sense of the people.&quot; Vindex Patriae denigrated the colonists as foreign vagabonds and ungrateful Scots-Irish subjects determined to &quot;strut and claim an independent property to the dunghill&quot;. These Loyalists beliefs can be seen in some of the early newspaper articles about the Stamp Act, but the anti-British writings were more prevalent and seem to have had a more powerful effect.

Many papers assumed a relatively conservative tone before the act went into effect, implying that they might close if it wasn&#x27;t repealed. However, as time passed and violent demonstrations ensued, the authors became more vitriolic. Several newspaper editors were involved with the Sons of Liberty, such as William Bradford of &quot;The Pennsylvania Journal&quot; and Benjamin Edes of &quot;The Boston Gazette&quot;, and they echoed the group&#x27;s sentiments in their publications. The Stamp Act went into effect that November and many newspapers printed their editions with black borders about the edges and columns, which sometimes included imagery of tombstones and skeletons, emphasizing that their papers were &quot;dead&quot; and would no longer be able to print because of the Stamp Act. However, most of them returned in the upcoming months, defiantly appearing without the stamp of approval that was deemed necessary by the Stamp Act. Printers were greatly relieved when the law was nullified in the following spring, and the repeal asserted their positions as a powerful voice (and compass) for public opinion.

===Protests in the streets===
While the colonial legislatures were acting, the ordinary citizens of the colonies were also voicing their concerns outside of this formal political process. Historian Gary B. Nash wrote:

====Maryland====
A popular pamphlet condemning the Stamp Act was written by Maryland lawyer Daniel Dulany in 1765. It was named &quot;Considerations on the Propriety of Imposing Taxes in the British Colonies&quot;. In Pokomoke, Maryland, a tax collector was assaulted. In Talbot County, Maryland, a group of unknown citizens released &quot;Resolutions of the Freemen of Talbot County Maryland&quot; on November 25, 1765. This proclamation declared that they should enjoy the same rights as British subjects and condemned the Stamp Act. They also declared that they would erect a gallows in front of the county court house with an effigy of a &quot;stamp informer&quot; hung in chains, which would remain until the Stamp Act was repealed.

====Massachusetts====
Early street protests were most notable in Boston. Andrew Oliver was a distributor of stamps for Massachusetts who was hanged in effigy on 14 August 1765 &quot;from a giant elm tree at the crossing of Essex and Orange Streets in the city&#x27;s South End.&quot; Also hung was a jackboot painted green on the bottom (&quot;a Green-ville sole&quot;), a pun on both Grenville and the Earl of Bute, the two people most blamed by the colonists. Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson ordered sheriff Stephen Greenleaf to take down the effigy, but he was opposed by a large crowd. All day the crowd detoured merchants on Orange Street to have their goods symbolically stamped under the elm tree, which later became known as the &quot;Liberty Tree&quot;. This date became accepted by the members of the Sons of Liberty in Boston as the date of the founding of their organization.

Ebenezer MacIntosh was a veteran of the Seven Years&#x27; War and a shoemaker. One night, he led a crowd which cut down the effigy of Andrew Oliver and took it in a funeral procession to the Town House where the legislature met. From there, they went to Oliver&#x27;s officewhich they tore down and symbolically stamped the timbers. Next, they took the effigy to Oliver&#x27;s home at the foot of Fort Hill, where they beheaded it and then burned italong with Oliver&#x27;s stable house and coach and chaise. Greenleaf and Hutchinson were stoned when they tried to stop the mob, which then looted and destroyed the contents of Oliver&#x27;s house. Oliver asked to be relieved of his duties the next day. This resignation, however, was not enough. Oliver was ultimately forced by MacIntosh to be paraded through the streets and to publicly resign under the Liberty Tree.

As news spread of the reasons for Andrew Oliver&#x27;s resignation, violence and threats of aggressive acts increased throughout the colonies, as did organized groups of resistance. Throughout the colonies, members of the middle and upper classes of society formed the foundation for these groups of resistance and soon called themselves the Sons of Liberty. These colonial groups of resistance burned effigies of royal officials, forced Stamp Act collectors to resign, and were able to get businessmen and judges to go about without using the proper stamps demanded by Parliament.

On 16 August, a mob damaged the home and official papers of William Story, the deputy register of the Vice-Admiralty, who then moved to Marblehead, Massachusetts. Benjamin Hallowell, the comptroller of customs, suffered the almost total loss of his home.

On 26 August, MacIntosh led an attack on Hutchinson&#x27;s mansion. The mob evicted the family, destroyed the furniture, tore down the interior walls, emptied the wine cellar, scattered Hutchinson&#x27;s collection of Massachusetts historical papers, and pulled down the building&#x27;s cupola. Hutchinson had been in public office for three decades; he estimated his loss at £2,218 (in today&#x27;s money, at nearly $250,000). Nash concludes that this attack was more than just a reaction to the Stamp Act:

Governor Francis Bernard offered a £300 reward for information on the leaders of the mob, but no information was forthcoming. MacIntosh and several others were arrested, but were either freed by pressure from the merchants or released by mob action.

The street demonstrations originated from the efforts of respectable public leaders such as James Otis, who commanded the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot;, and Samuel Adams of the &quot;Loyal Nine&quot; of the Boston Caucus, an organization of Boston merchants. They made efforts to control the people below them on the economic and social scale, but they were often unsuccessful in maintaining a delicate balance between mass demonstrations and riots. These men needed the support of the working class, but also had to establish the legitimacy of their actions to have their protests to England taken seriously. At the time of these protests, the Loyal Nine was more of a social club with political interests but, by December 1765, it began issuing statements as the Sons of Liberty.

====Rhode Island====
Rhode Island also experienced street violence. A crowd built a gallows near the Town House in Newport on 27 August, where they carried effigies of three officials appointed as stamp distributors: Augustus Johnson, Dr. Thomas Moffat, and lawyer Martin Howard. The crowd at first was led by merchants William Ellery, Samuel Vernon, and Robert Crook, but they soon lost control. That night, the crowd was led by a poor man named John Weber, and they attacked the houses of Moffat and Howard, where they destroyed walls, fences, art, furniture, and wine. The local Sons of Liberty were publicly opposed to violence, and they refused at first to support Weber when he was arrested. They were persuaded to come to his assistance, however, when retaliation was threatened against their own homes. Weber was released and faded into obscurity.

Howard became the only prominent American to publicly support the Stamp Act in his pamphlet &quot;A Colonist&#x27;s Defence of Taxation&quot; (1765). After the riots, Howard had to leave the colony, but he was rewarded by the Crown with an appointment as Chief Justice of North Carolina at a salary of £1,000.

====New York====

In New York, James McEvers resigned his distributorship four days after the attack on Hutchinson&#x27;s house. The first shipment of stamps for New York and Connecticut arrived at New York Harbor on 24 October, greeted by a huge crowd of angry colonists, and were kept at Fort George for safe keeping. Placards appeared throughout the city warning that, &quot;the first man that either distributes or makes use of stamped paper let him take care of his house, person, and effects.&quot; New York merchants met on 31 October and agreed not to sell any English goods until the act was repealed. Crowds took to the streets for four days of demonstrations, uncontrolled by the local leaders, culminating in an attack by two thousand people on Governor Cadwallader Colden&#x27;s home and the burning of two sleighs and a coach. Various stamp masters, including Zachariah Hood from Maryland, fled to Fort George out of concern for their safety. Unrest in New York City continued through the end of the year, and the local Sons of Liberty had difficulty in controlling crowd actions. Sir Henry Moore, who replaced Colden as provincial governor of New York, met with the influential Isaac Sears, a leader of the Sons of Liberty, in an effort to maintain peace and restore order to the city. Shortly thereafter Moore opened the gates of the fort as a gesture of good faith and invited people in.

====Virginia====
During the Stamp Act 1765 crisis, Archibald McCall (1734–1814) sided against patriots in Westmoreland and Essex County, Virginia. He insisted on collecting the British tax that was placed on stamps and other documents. In reaction, a mob formed and stormed his house in Tappahannock, Virginia. They threw rocks through the windows and McCall was captured, tarred and feathered. The act was an example of &quot;taxation without representation&quot; and a leading event to the war against the British.

====Other Colonies====
In Frederick, Maryland, a court of 12 magistrates ruled the Stamp Act invalid on 23 November 1765, and directed that businesses and colonial officials proceed in all matters without use of the stamps. A week later, a crowd conducted a mock funeral procession for the act in the streets of Frederick. The magistrates have been dubbed the &quot;12 Immortal Justices,&quot; and 23 November has been designated &quot;Repudiation Day&quot; by the Maryland state legislature. On 1 October 2015, Senator Cardin (D-MD) read into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; a statement noting 2015 as the 250th anniversary of the event. Among the 12 magistrates was William Luckett, who later served as lieutenant colonel in the Maryland Militia at the Battle of Germantown.

Other popular demonstrations occurred in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Annapolis, Maryland; Wilmington and New Bern, North Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania demonstrations were subdued but even targeted Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s home, although it was not vandalized. By 16 November, twelve of the stamp distributors had resigned. The Georgia distributor did not arrive in America until January 1766, but his first and only official action was to resign.

The overall effect of these protests was to both anger and unite the American people like never before. Opposition to the act inspired both political and constitutional forms of literature throughout the colonies, strengthened the colonial political perception and involvement, and created new forms of organized resistance. These organized groups quickly learned that they could force royal officials to resign by employing violent measures and threats.

====Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and the Caribbean====
The main issue was the constitutional rights of Englishmen, so the French in Quebec did not react. Some English-speaking merchants were opposed but were in a fairly small minority. The &quot;Quebec Gazette&quot; ceased publication until the act was repealed, apparently over the unwillingness to use stamped paper. In neighboring Nova Scotia a number of former New England residents objected, but recent British immigrants and London-oriented business interests based in Halifax, the provincial capital were more influential. The only major public protest was the hanging in effigy of the stamp distributor and Lord Bute. The act was implemented in both provinces, but Nova Scotia&#x27;s stamp distributor resigned in January 1766, beset by ungrounded fears for his safety. Authorities there were ordered to allow ships bearing unstamped papers to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps. The act occasioned some protests in Newfoundland, and the drafting of petitions opposing not only the Stamp Act, but the existence of the customhouse at St. John&#x27;s, based on legislation dating back to the reign of Edward VI forbidding any sort of duties on the importation of goods related to its fisheries.

Violent protests were few in the Caribbean colonies. Political opposition was expressed in a number of colonies, including Barbados and Antigua, and by absentee landowners living in Britain. The worst political violence took place on St. Kitts and Nevis. Riots took place on 31 October 1765, and again on 5 November, targeting the homes and offices of stamp distributors; the number of participants suggests that the percentage of St. Kitts&#x27; white population involved matched that of Bostonian involvement in its riots. The delivery of stamps to St. Kitts was successfully blocked, and they were never used there. Montserrat and Antigua also succeeded in avoiding the use of stamps; some correspondents thought that rioting was prevented in Antigua only by the large troop presence. Despite vocal political opposition, Barbados used the stamps, to the pleasure of King George. In Jamaica there was also vocal opposition, which included threats of violence. There was much evasion of the stamps, and ships arriving without stamped papers were allowed to enter port. Despite this, Jamaica produced more stamp revenue (£2,000) than any other colony.

====Sons of Liberty====
It was during this time of street demonstrations that locally organized groups started to merge into an inter-colonial organization of a type not previously seen in the colonies. The term &quot;sons of liberty&quot; had been used in a generic fashion well before 1765, but it was only around February 1766 that its influence extended throughout the colonies as an organized group using the formal name &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, leading to a pattern for future resistance to the British that carried the colonies towards 1776. Historian John C. Miller noted that the name was adopted as a result of Barre&#x27;s use of the term in his February 1765 speech.

The organization spread month by month after independent starts in several different colonies. By 6 November, a committee was set up in New York to correspond with other colonies, and in December an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut. In January, a correspondence link was established between Boston and Manhattan, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, New Hampshire, and Newport. By March, Sons of Liberty organizations had been established in New Jersey, Maryland, and Norfolk, Virginia, and a local group established in North Carolina was attracting interest in South Carolina and Georgia.

The officers and leaders of the Sons of Liberty &quot;were drawn almost entirely from the middle and upper ranks of colonial society,&quot; but they recognized the need to expand their power base to include &quot;the whole of political society, involving all of its social or economic subdivisions.&quot; To do this, the Sons of Liberty relied on large public demonstrations to expand their base. They learned early on that controlling such crowds was problematical, although they strived to control &quot;the possible violence of extra-legal gatherings&quot;. The organization professed its loyalty to both local and British established government, but possible military action as a defensive measure was always part of their considerations. Throughout the Stamp Act Crisis, the Sons of Liberty professed continued loyalty to the King because they maintained a &quot;fundamental confidence&quot; that Parliament would do the right thing and repeal the tax.

===Stamp Act Congress===

The Stamp Act Congress was held in New York in October 1765. Twenty-seven delegates from nine colonies were the members of the Congress, and their responsibility was to draft a set of formal petitions stating why Parliament had no right to tax them. Among the delegates were many important men in the colonies. Historian John Miller observes, &quot;The composition of this Stamp Act Congress ought to have been convincing proof to the British government that resistance to parliamentary taxation was by no means confined to the riffraff of colonial seaports.&quot;

The youngest delegate was 26-year-old John Rutledge of South Carolina, and the oldest was 65-year-old Hendrick Fisher of New Jersey. Ten of the delegates were lawyers, ten were merchants, and seven were planters or land-owning farmers; all had served in some type of elective office, and all but three were born in the colonies. Four died before the colonies declared independence, and four signed the Declaration of Independence; nine attended the first and second Continental Congresses, and three were Loyalists during the Revolution.

New Hampshire declined to send delegates, and North Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia were not represented because their governors did not call their legislatures into session, thus preventing the selection of delegates. Despite the composition of the congress, each of the Thirteen Colonies eventually affirmed its decisions. Six of the nine colonies represented at the Congress agreed to sign the petitions to the King and Parliament produced by the Congress. The delegations from New York, Connecticut, and South Carolina were prohibited from signing any documents without first receiving approval from the colonial assemblies that had appointed them.

Massachusetts governor Francis Bernard believed that his colony&#x27;s delegates to the Congress would be supportive of Parliament. Timothy Ruggles in particular was Bernard&#x27;s man, and was elected chairman of the Congress. Ruggles&#x27; instructions from Bernard were to &quot;recommend submission to the Stamp Act until Parliament could be persuaded to repeal it.&quot; Many delegates felt that a final resolution of the Stamp Act would actually bring Britain and the colonies closer together. Robert Livingston of New York stressed the importance of removing the Stamp Act from the public debate, writing to his colony&#x27;s agent in England, &quot;If I really wished to see America in a state of independence I should desire as one of the most effectual means to that end that the stamp act should be enforced.&quot;
The Congress met for 12 consecutive days, including Sundays. There was no audience at the meetings, and no information was released about the deliberations. The meeting&#x27;s final product was called &quot;The Declaration of Rights and Grievances&quot;, and was drawn up by delegate John Dickinson of Pennsylvania. This Declaration raised fourteen points of colonial protest. It asserted that colonists possessed all the rights of Englishmen in addition to protesting the Stamp Act issue, and that Parliament could not represent the colonists since they had no voting rights over Parliament. Only the colonial assemblies had a right to tax the colonies. They also asserted that the extension of authority of the admiralty courts to non-naval matters represented an abuse of power.

In addition to simply arguing for their rights as Englishmen, the congress also asserted that they had certain natural rights solely because they were human beings. Resolution 3 stated, &quot;That it is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people, and the undoubted right of Englishmen, that no taxes be imposed on them, but with their own consent, given personally, or by their representatives.&quot; Both Massachusetts and Pennsylvania brought forth the issue in separate resolutions even more directly when they respectively referred to &quot;the Natural rights of Mankind&quot; and &quot;the common rights of mankind&quot;.

Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina had proposed that the Congress&#x27; petition should go only to the king, since the rights of the colonies did not originate with Parliament. This radical proposal went too far for most delegates and was rejected. The &quot;Declaration of Rights and Grievances&quot; was duly sent to the king, and petitions were also sent to both Houses of Parliament.

==Repeal==

Grenville was replaced by Lord Rockingham as prime minister on 10 July 1765. News of the mob violence began to reach England in October. Conflicting sentiments were taking hold in Britain at the same time that resistance was building and accelerating in America. Some wanted to strictly enforce the Stamp Act 1765 over colonial resistance, wary of the precedent that would be set by backing down. Others felt the economic effects of reduced trade with America after the Sugar Act 1764 and an inability to collect debts while the colonial economy suffered, and they began to lobby for a repeal of the Stamp Act 1765. The colonial protest had included various non-importation agreements among merchants who recognized that a significant portion of British industry and commerce was dependent on the colonial market. This movement had also spread through the colonies; 200 merchants had met in New York City and agreed to import nothing from England until the Stamp Act 1765 was repealed.

When Parliament met in December 1765, it rejected a resolution offered by Grenville that would have condemned colonial resistance to the enforcement of the act. Outside of Parliament, Rockingham and his secretary Edmund Burke, a member of Parliament himself, organized London merchants who started a committee of correspondence to support repeal of the Stamp Act 1765 by urging merchants throughout the country to contact their local representatives in Parliament. When Parliament reconvened on 14 January 1766, the Rockingham ministry formally proposed repeal. Amendments were considered that would have lessened the financial impact on the colonies by allowing colonists to pay the tax in their own scrip, but this was viewed to be too little and too late.

William Pitt stated in the parliamentary debate that everything done by the Grenville ministry &quot;has been entirely wrong&quot; with respect to the colonies. He further stated, &quot;It is my opinion that this Kingdom has no right to lay a tax upon the colonies.&quot; Pitt still maintained &quot;the authority of this kingdom over the colonies, to be sovereign and supreme, in every circumstance of government and legislature whatsoever,&quot; but he made the distinction that taxes were not part of governing, but were &quot;a voluntary gift and grant of the Commons alone.&quot; He rejected the notion of virtual representation, as &quot;the most contemptible idea that ever entered into the head of man.&quot;

Grenville responded to Pitt:

Pitt&#x27;s response to Grenville included, &quot;I rejoice that America has resisted. Three millions of people, so dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be slaves, would have been fit instruments to make slaves of the rest.&quot;

Between 17 and 27 January, Rockingham shifted the attention from constitutional arguments to economic by presenting petitions complaining of the economic repercussions felt throughout the country. On 7 February, the House of Commons rejected a resolution by 274–134, saying that it would back the king in enforcing the act. Henry Seymour Conway, the government&#x27;s leader in the House of Commons, introduced the Declaratory Act 1766 in an attempt to address both the constitutional and the economic issues, which affirmed the right of Parliament to legislate for the colonies &quot;in all cases whatsoever&quot;, while admitting the inexpediency of attempting to enforce the Stamp Act. Only Pitt and three or four others voted against it. Other resolutions passed which condemned the riots and demanded compensation from the colonies for those who suffered losses because of the actions of the mobs.

The House of Commons heard testimony between 11 and 13 February, the most important witness being Benjamin Franklin on the last day of the hearings. He responded to the question about how the colonists would react if the act was not repealed: &quot;A total loss of the respect and affection the people of America bear to this country, and of all the commerce that depends on that respect and affection.&quot; A Scottish journalist observed Franklin&#x27;s answers to Parliament and his effect on the repeal; he later wrote to Franklin, &quot;To this very Examination, more than to any thing else, you are indebted to the speedy and total Repeal of this odious Law.&quot;

A repealing bill was introduced on 21 February to repeal the Stamp Act 1765, and it passed by a vote of 276–168. The king gave royal assent to the resulting on 18 March 1766. To celebrate the repeal, the Sons of Liberty in Dedham, Massachusetts erected the Pillar of Liberty with a bust of Pitt on top.

==Legacy==

Some aspects of the resistance to the act provided a sort of rehearsal for similar acts of resistance to the 1767 Townshend Acts, particularly the activities of the Sons of Liberty and merchants in organizing opposition. The Stamp Act Congress was a predecessor to the later Continental Congresses, notably the Second Continental Congress which oversaw the establishment of American independence. The Committees of Correspondence used to coordinate activities were revived between 1772 and 1774 in response to a variety of controversial and unpopular affairs, and the colonies that met at the 1774 First Continental Congress established a non-importation agreement known as the Continental Association in response to Parliamentary passage of the Intolerable Acts.

<doc id="159116" wikidata="Q749617" url="?curid=159116" title="Tusk (album)">
<text>Tusk is the twelfth studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released as a double album on 12 October 1979 in the United States and on 19 October 1979 in the United Kingdom by Warner Bros. Records. It is considered more experimental than their previous albums, partly as a consequence of Lindsey Buckingham&#x27;s sparser songwriting arrangements and the influence of post-punk. The production costs were initially estimated to be about $1 million but many years later were revealed to be about $1.4 million (equivalent to $ in ), making it the most expensive rock album recorded to that date.

The band embarked on a nine-month tour to promote &quot;Tusk&quot;. They travelled extensively across the world, including the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. In Germany, they shared the bill with Bob Marley. On this world tour, the band recorded music for the &quot;Fleetwood Mac Live&quot; album, released in 1980.

Compared to 1977&#x27;s &quot;Rumours&quot;, which sold ten million copies by February 1978, &quot;Tusk&quot; was regarded as a commercial failure by the label, selling four million copies. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Tusk&quot; at number 445 in their list of &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2000, it was voted number 853 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Background==
Going into &quot;Tusk&quot;, Lindsey Buckingham was adamant about creating an album that sounded nothing like &quot;Rumours&quot;: &quot;For me, being sort of the culprit behind that particular album, it was done in a way to undermine just sort of following the formula of doing &quot;Rumours 2&quot; and &quot;Rumours 3&quot;, which is kind of the business model Warner Bros. would have liked us to follow.&quot; Mick Fleetwood decided early on that &quot;Tusk&quot; was to be a double album. Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson, who was dating Christine McVie at the time, offered to host the band at the Beach Boys&#x27; studio, which they were about to renovate. While the band initially agreed to this idea, an attorney for the Beach Boys later told Fleetwood Mac that they would still have to pay for the facility even if they decided not to use it. Fleetwood Mac subsequently backed out of the deal and approached Geordie Hormel, who offered to construct a custom studio for the band at The Village Recorder and presented them with an option to either purchase the studio or rent it. Fleetwood Mac producer Ken Caillat suggested that the band purchase the studio, reckoning that this would be the cheaper option. However, Fleetwood&#x27;s attorney opted to rent the custom studio, which was named Studio D.

Production costs rose beyond a million dollars, far more than &quot;Rumours&quot;. Regarding the album&#x27;s production costs, guitarist Lindsey Buckingham stated: &quot;During the making of &quot;Tusk&quot;, we were in the studio for about 10 months and we got 20 songs out of it. &quot;Rumours&quot; took the same amount of time. It [&quot;Rumours&quot;] didn&#x27;t cost so much because we were in a cheaper studio. There&#x27;s no denying what it cost, but I think it&#x27;s been taken out of context.&quot;

After the studio was built, Buckingham queried Fleetwood about recording some songs at his home studio. Fleetwood acquiesced, but told Buckingham that the other members of Fleetwood Mac would need to be integrated at some point. For certain songs, Buckingham played a Kleenex box as a snare drum and had Fleetwood overdub his own drums over Buckingham&#x27;s demo. Several of Buckingham&#x27;s songs began as demos recorded at his home studio with him playing all of the instruments, including &quot;The Ledge&quot;, &quot;Save Me a Place&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s Enough for Me&quot;.

Caillat recalled that Buckingham&#x27;s obsessive nature in the recording studio was the source of some tension: &quot;He was a maniac. The first day, I set the studio up as usual. Then he said, &#x27;Turn every knob 180 degrees from where it is now and see what happens.&#x27; He&#x27;d tape microphones to the studio floor and get into a sort of push-up position to sing. Early on, he came in and he&#x27;d freaked out in the shower and cut off all his hair with nail scissors. He was stressed.&quot; Buckingham had expressed interest in starting a solo career during the making of &quot;Tusk&quot; so in an effort to appease him, the rest of the band acquiesced to Buckingham&#x27;s desire to create a more experimental album.

Buckingham – infatuated with bands such as Talking Heads – was &quot;desperate to make Mac relevant to a post-punk world&quot;, according to music journalist Bob Stanley, who commented that, compared to &quot;Rumours&quot;, &quot;Tusk&quot; was &quot;unleavened weirdness, as close to its predecessor as the Beach Boys&#x27; lo-fi &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; had been to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Much of it sounded clattery, half-formed, with strange rhythmic leaps and offbeat tics.&quot; Journalist Adam Webb described the &quot;Tusk&quot; recording sessions as a &quot;cocaine blizzard&quot; from which Christine McVie&#x27;s then-boyfriend, Beach Boy drummer Dennis Wilson, &quot;never really came out.&quot; Music historian Domenic Priore claimed that, for research purposes during the album&#x27;s recording, Buckingham accessed the master tapes for the Beach Boys&#x27; unreleased album &quot;Smile&quot;, and that the tracks &quot;That&#x27;s All for Everyone&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Child&quot; most strongly exemplify its influence.

Bassist John McVie commented that the album &quot;sounds like the work of three solo artists&quot;, while Fleetwood said it was his second favourite Fleetwood Mac studio album behind &quot;Then Play On&quot;. &quot;You got that sweetness [from Nicks and McVie] and me as the complete nutcase,&quot; Buckingham observed. &quot;That&#x27;s what makes us Fleetwood Mac.&quot;

==Artwork==
Rather than solicit the services of Herbert W. Worthington, who created the cover art for &quot;Rumours&quot;, the band opted to select three photographers from different disciplines to design the album sleeve for &quot;Tusk&quot;. Peter Beard, who specialised as a documentary photographer, was enlisted to supply images for the album sleeve and spent two weeks in the recording studio taking Polaroids of the band and its inner circle. He also augmented this footage with images of elephant tusks. During one of those sessions, Beard took a photo of Caillat&#x27;s dog biting his leg, which ultimately became the cover art for &quot;Tusk&quot;. Fleetwood had originally promised Nicks that the cover art would feature an image of her twirling and dancing; Nicks later told Caillat that she placed a curse on his dog for &quot;stealing her cover&quot;.

Norman Seeff recalled that he encountered some difficulties in assembling all five members into one location and likened the experience to &quot;herding cats&quot;. 

It was like being a sort of a school teacher in the kindergarten because everyone was having their own wonderful time...Each of them was individually fascinating, but together you could feel an electricity between everyone. And I’m working with all the stories of what was going on with them, and then they start to touch each other and flow with the music. It was magic, because rather than being five separate people they became one.

Jayme Odgers was responsible for creating the upside-down photograph found in the booklet, which featured Fleetwood clinging to a chair on the ceiling, Buckingham and Nicks suspended in the air, and both McVies firmly planted on the ground. When Odgers proposed the idea, the band was uncooperative and refused to be in the same room together, so Odgers instead took photographs of the band individually in different poses. Odgers pieced together the separate shots into a more cohesive photograph and credited the band&#x27;s obstinance for achieving the final product. &quot;Unbeknownst to them, my photographic forte was putting separate images together seamlessly, so I pushed on. Had they all been willing to be photographed together, the image never would have looked like it does.&quot; The photo also served as a point of contention for Warner Bros, who opposed its inclusion in the booklet. According to Odgers, Fleetwood informed him that the band spent two hours discussing the fate of the image; Fleetwood ultimately convinced Warner Bros to keep the image on the grounds that it would potentially elicit further discussion among the public. In 2016, a black-and-white version of Odger&#x27;s photo was used as the front cover of the &quot;Alternate Tusk&quot; album, a collection issued by Rhino Records consisting of alternate takes and live recordings.

==Releases==
&quot;Tusk&quot; peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States and spent almost nine months on the chart. It was certified double platinum for shipping two million copies. It peaked at number one in the UK and achieved a platinum award for shipments in excess of 300,000 copies. The album gave the group two US top-10 hit singles, with the Buckingham-penned title track (US number eight/UK number six), and the Stevie Nicks composition &quot;Sara&quot; (US number seven/UK number 37).

Though the album sold four million copies worldwide, and earned a Grammy nomination in 1981 for its art design in the category &quot;Best Album Package&quot;, the band&#x27;s record label deemed the project a failure, laying the blame squarely with Buckingham (considering the comparatively huge sales of &quot;Rumours&quot; and the album&#x27;s unprecedented recording expense). Fleetwood, however, blames the album&#x27;s relative failure on the RKO radio chain playing the album in its entirety prior to release, thus allowing mass home recording. In addition, &quot;Tusk&quot; was a double album, with a high list price of US$16.00, or $56.00 in 2019 terms. The band originally considered the idea of releasing &quot;Tusk&quot; as two single albums each with the price of $7.98, but the record label decided against this.

Further releases from the album &quot;Not That Funny&quot; (UK-only single release), &quot;Think About Me&quot;, and &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot; were slightly remixed for radio, and were less successful. The latter two appear in their &#x27;single versions&#x27; on the 2002 compilation &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac&quot;, while &quot;Sara&quot;, which was cut to 4 minutes for both the single and the first CD release of the album, appears in its unedited form on the 1988 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation, the 2002 release &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac&quot;, and the 2004 reissue of &quot;Tusk&quot;.

The album was remade in its entirety by American alternative rock band Camper Van Beethoven and released in 2003.

== Critical reception ==
In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Stephen Holden emphasised the experimental nature of the album, comparing it to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot; in that &quot;&quot;Tusk&quot; is less a collection of finished songs than a mosaic of pop-rock fragments by individual performers.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was more ambivalent, lauding Buckingham&#x27;s production and experimentation, while dismissing Christine McVie&#x27;s and Stevie Nicks&#x27;s contributions. Retrospectively, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine found the album to be timeless, calling it &quot;a peerless piece of pop art&quot; that rivals the more accessible &quot;Rumours&quot; album in terms of quality. Amanda Petrusich of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; found the album &quot;self-indulgent&quot; and &quot;terrifically strange&quot;. Contemporary and retrospective reviewers alike have noted the stark contrast between the album&#x27;s lush opening track, &quot;Over &amp; Over&quot;, and jarring production of the following track, &quot;The Ledge&quot;.

<text>Queens of the Stone Age (commonly abbreviated as QOTSA or QotSA) is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington in 1996. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Josh Homme shortly before he returned to his native Palm Desert, California. Homme has been the only constant member throughout multiple line-up changes; the line-up since 2013 has consisted of Homme, Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboards, percussion, backing vocals), Michael Shuman (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and Jon Theodore (drums, percussion).

Formed after the dissolution of Homme&#x27;s previous band Kyuss, the band originated from the spread of the Palm Desert music scene. Its self-titled debut album (1998) was recorded with Homme singing and playing all instruments except drums, which were provided by former Kyuss member Alfredo Hernández. Bassist Nick Oliveri joined the band for its accompanying tour and soon became co-lead vocalist alongside Homme. The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Rated R&quot; (2000), featured Mark Lanegan as a guest vocalist and was the band&#x27;s major label debut with Interscope Records. It was critically and commercially successful, and featured the breakout single &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret&quot;. The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; (2002), featured Dave Grohl on drums alongside contributions from Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider; it is regarded by many to be the band&#x27;s greatest work.

After Oliveri&#x27;s and Lanegan&#x27;s respective departures in 2004 and 2005, Homme once again became the band&#x27;s sole lead vocalist; Van Leeuwen and drummer Joey Castillo collaborating on &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot; (2005) and &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot; (2007). After several years of inactivity, the band signed to independent label Matador Records in 2013 and released a loose trilogy of albums over the next decade: &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot; (2013), &quot;Villains&quot; (2017), and &quot;In Times New Roman...&quot; (2023). The trilogy brought further acclaim and commercial success, with &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot; becoming the band&#x27;s first album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

The band has been nominated for 9 Grammy Awards: four for Best Hard Rock Performance, three for Best Rock Album, and one each for Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song. The band also has a large pool of contributors and collaborators and is known for incorporating elements of blues, electronica, and Krautrock into its riff-oriented and rhythmic hard rock, coupled with Homme&#x27;s distinct falsetto vocals and unorthodox guitar scales.

==History==
===Formation and debut album (1996–1999)===
After the breakup of his previous band Kyuss in 1995, Josh Homme moved to Seattle, where he briefly joined Screaming Trees as a touring guitarist. He later formed a new band called Gamma Ray, which released the eponymous &quot;Gamma Ray&quot; EP (1996), featuring &quot;Born to Hula&quot; and &quot;If Only Everything&quot; (which would later appear on their self-titled debut as &quot;If Only&quot;). The EP featured Matt Cameron of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, Van Conner of Screaming Trees, and percussionist Victor Indrizzo.

Gamma Ray changed their name in 1997 after the German power metal band Gamma Ray threatened to sue. The name &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; came from a nickname given to Kyuss by their producer Chris Goss. Homme said of the name: &quot;Kings would be too macho. The Kings of the Stone Age wear armor and have axes and wrestle. The Queens of the Stone Age hang out with the Kings of the Stone Age&#x27;s girlfriends when they wrestle ... Rock should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls. That way everyone&#x27;s happy and it&#x27;s more of a party. Kings of the Stone Age is too lopsided.&quot;

The first release under the Queens of the Stone Age name was the song &quot;18 A.D.,&quot; released on Roadrunner Records&#x27; compilation album &quot;Burn One Up! Music for Stoners.&quot; It featured guitarist Dave Catching as well as the bassist and drummer of the Dutch stoner rock band Beaver, owing to connections Homme made while living in Amsterdam for a few months following Kyuss&#x27; breakup. The band&#x27;s first live appearance was at Seattle&#x27;s OK Hotel on November 20, 1997, with Cameron on drums, Mike Johnson of Dinosaur Jr. on bass and John McBain of Monster Magnet on guitar. In December that year, the band released a split EP, &quot;Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age&quot;, which featured three tracks from the Gamma Ray sessions as well as three Kyuss tracks recorded in 1995 prior to their breakup.

Homme returned to Palm Desert, California, where he released Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s self-titled debut album in 1998 on Stone Gossard&#x27;s and Regan Hagar&#x27;s label Loosegroove Records, and on vinyl by Man&#x27;s Ruin Records. Homme played guitar and bass on the album (the latter credited to Homme&#x27;s alter-ego Carlo Von Sexron), Alfredo Hernández on drums, and several other contributions by Chris Goss and Hutch. Homme reportedly asked Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan to appear on the record, but he was unable due to other commitments.

Soon after the recording sessions were finished for the album, former Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri joined the group, and touring commenced with a band consisting entirely of ex-Kyuss members. Catching, a former Kyuss guitar tech, joined shortly after. From this point forward, the band&#x27;s line-up would change frequently; by the time their second album was being recorded, Hernández had left the group to play in other bands.

===&quot;Rated R&quot; (2000–2001)===
Released in 2000, &quot;Rated R&quot; featured myriad musicians familiar with Homme and Oliveri&#x27;s work and &quot;crew&quot; of sorts: former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan, drummers Nick Lucero and Gene Trautmann, guitarists Dave Catching, Brendon McNichol, and Chris Goss contributed, and even Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford, recording next door, stepped in for a guest spot on &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer.&quot; 
The album garnered positive reviews and received a lot more attention than their debut, despite the fact that the lyrics to &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot; were deemed by mega-retailer Walmart to promote drug use, almost causing the record to get pulled from store shelves. The success of the record also earned the band notable opening slots with The Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters, Hole, and a place at Ozzfest 2000. It was during this time that Homme stated:

During the 2001 Rock in Rio show, bassist Nick Oliveri was arrested after performing on stage naked, with only his bass guitar covering his genitals. Oliveri apologized to officials, saying that he did not know it was a crime in Brazil.

Following his work on &quot;Rated R&quot;, Lanegan joined the band as a full-time member, a position he held until early 2005. Towards the end of the &quot;Rated R&quot; tour, the band&#x27;s performance at the 2001 Rock am Ring festival in Germany was, according to Homme, &quot;the worst show we&#x27;ve ever played and it was in front of 40,000 people.&quot; The band decided to tattoo themselves with the starting time of the performance, &quot;Freitag 4:15.&quot; As Oliveri explained:

===&quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, mainstream exposure and Oliveri&#x27;s departure (2001–2004)===
Dave Grohl, Foo Fighters frontman and former Nirvana drummer, joined in late 2001 to record drums for the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Songs for the Deaf.&quot; It was released in August 2002 and again featured Lanegan. The final track on the album, &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;, featured former A Perfect Circle member Paz Lenchantin on viola and piano along with Dean Ween on guitar. Another former A Perfect Circle member, guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, joined the touring line-up following the album&#x27;s release.

&quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; was a critical hit and was certified gold in 2003, with sales of over 900,000. The singles &quot;No One Knows&quot; and &quot;Go with the Flow&quot; became hits on radio and MTV, with the former just outside the Billboard Top 40. &quot;No One Knows&quot; and &quot;Go with the Flow&quot; were also featured on the first iterations of the popular video games &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; (respectively). Furthermore, the latter track was featured in the popular video game &quot;Fortnite&quot; as a song in &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot;. The song &quot;You Think I Ain&#x27;t Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire&quot; was featured in the video games, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; and &quot;IndyCar Series&quot;. It was also used as the theme song in Naughty Dog&#x27;s &quot;Jak X: Combat Racing&quot; in 2005 along with &quot;Song for the Dead&quot;. The song was also used in the films &quot;xXx&quot;, &quot;Project X&quot; and &quot;Skincare&quot;.
The &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; tour culminated in a string of headline dates in Australia in January 2004. Grohl returned to his other projects and was replaced on the European leg of the tour by former Danzig drummer Joey Castillo, who joined the band full-time. After the tour, Homme fired Oliveri, as he was convinced that Oliveri had been physically abusive to his girlfriend: &quot;A couple years ago, I spoke to Nick about a rumor I heard. I said, &#x27;If I ever find out that this is true, I can&#x27;t know you, man.&#x27;&quot; Homme considered breaking up the band after firing Oliveri, but found a new determination to continue. Oliveri countered in the press that the band had been &quot;poisoned by hunger for power&quot; and that without him, they were &quot;Queens Lite.&quot; He later softened his opinion and said: &quot;My relationship with Josh is good. The new Queens record kicks ass.&quot; The two reportedly are still friends and as of October 2006, Oliveri was interested in rejoining the band. Oliveri later contributed to Queens of the Stone Age for the first time in nine years, contributing backing vocals to the band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;.

===&quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot; (2004–2006)===

In late 2004, Homme, along with Eleven multi-instrumentalist Alain Johannes and remaining band members Van Leeuwen and Castillo recorded the Queens&#x27; fourth studio album, &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot;, a title taken from a lyric in &quot;Mosquito Song&quot; from their previous album. The album featured guests including ZZ Top&#x27;s Billy Gibbons. Despite Lanegan reportedly turning down an invitation to remain with the band, he recorded vocals on new tracks (notably the solo vocalist on the opening track &quot;This Lullaby&quot;) and appeared on the supporting tour as scheduling and his health permitted.

&quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot; was leaked onto the internet in February 2005 and was aired by Triple J radio in Australia on March 3, 2005, as an unsubstantiated &#x27;World Premiere&#x27;. It was then officially released on Tuesday, March 22, 2005, in the US, debuting in the number 5 slot on the Billboard Music Chart, the greatest debut of any Queens record until &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot; debuted at number 1 in June 2013.

On May 14, 2005, the group was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, hosted by Will Ferrell. One of Ferrell&#x27;s popular Saturday Night Live characters, fictional Blue Öyster Cult cowbellist Gene Frenkle, made a re-appearance on the show, playing with the Queens on their first song of the night, &quot;Little Sister.&quot; Frenkle played the song&#x27;s wood block part using a cowbell along with the band.

On November 22, 2005, Queens of the Stone Age released a live album/DVD set, &quot;Over the Years and Through the Woods&quot;, featuring a live concert filmed in London, England, and bonus features which included rare videos of songs from 1998 to 2005. In 2005, the group supported Nine Inch Nails on their North American tour of &quot;With Teeth&quot; along with Autolux (for the first half of the tour) and Death from Above 1979 (for the second). NIN&#x27;s guitarist Aaron North appeared as an onstage guest with the Queens for the songs &quot;Born to Hula,&quot; &quot;Regular John,&quot; &quot;Avon,&quot; &quot;Monsters in the Parasol&quot; and &quot;Long, Slow Goodbye&quot; at the Wiltern LG in Los Angeles on December 19 and 20, 2005.

Another onstage guest for the December 20 performance was Homme&#x27;s former Kyuss bandmate John Garcia, the first time that Homme and Garcia had played together since 1997. As a special encore they performed three Kyuss songs: &quot;Thumb,&quot; &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop.&quot; Homme stated that the band&#x27;s lowest point was during the &quot;Lullabies&quot; era, but that the record &quot;took the lead jacket off&quot; the band following the firing of Oliveri in 2004.

===&quot;Era Vulgaris&quot; and death of Shneider (2007–2008)===

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2007, the band&#x27;s official website announced the new album would be titled &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot;, and would be released in June. Later in February, teaser videos surfaced showing Homme, Castillo, Van Leeuwen and Johannes in studio. Several sites reported that the album would include many guest vocalists, including Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails, Julian Casablancas from The Strokes, Mark Lanegan, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, and deceased humorist Erma Bombeck. Death from Above 1979 bassist Jesse F. Keeler had been expected to play bass on the studio recording of the album, but not to tour; however, due to schedule conflicts, he stated he would not be appearing on the album.

&quot;Era Vulgaris&quot; was completed in early April 2007 and released June 12, 2007 in the US. The tracks &quot;Sick, Sick, Sick&quot; and &quot;3&#x27;s &amp; 7&#x27;s&quot; were released as singles in early June. Homme has described the record as &quot;dark, hard, and electrical, sort of like a construction worker.&quot; When asked about the vocals on the record, specifically the different style of singing that Homme used, he replied:

Bassist Michael Shuman (Wires On Fire, Jubilee and Mini Mansions) and keyboardist Dean Fertita (The Waxwings, The Dead Weather) took over touring duties from Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider, respectively. In July 2007, Van Leeuwen stated the band had written new material, &quot;still in its infancy&quot; which Homme later suggested might be released as an EP. Following a subsequent interview with Homme, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that the EP &quot;could contain as many as 10 B-sides recorded during the &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot; sessions.&quot; It was later reported that the EP would not be released due to the record label&#x27;s unwillingness to put out another QOTSA release at that time.

The band began a North American Tour in 2007, which they named the &quot;Duluth Tour&quot; because they were going to many small towns and cities they had never played before, such as Duluth, Minnesota. The tour was extended to other areas, such as the United Kingdom, where the band played more shows than on any of their previous UK tours. The band toured in Australia in late March to early April 2008, on the V festival tour, including a string of side shows. Throughout the beginning of May 2008, the band completed the Canadian leg of its touring.

In November 2007, Queens of the Stone Age performed a semi-acoustic set in an underground salt mine in Germany, performing a selection of hits, rarities, covers and an unreleased song named &quot;Cathedral City.&quot; A DVD of the concert was planned but aside from a trailer promoting the DVD and a number of photographs, no footage of the concert has been released.

On July 2, 2008, Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s former keyboardist Natasha Shneider died of lung cancer at the age of 52. The news broke with a message posted on the MySpace page of the band Sweethead, of which Natasha&#x27;s close friend and former bandmate Troy Van Leeuwen is a member. The band&#x27;s homepage was updated with a memorial message by Homme replacing the normal front page. The band performed a concert in celebration of Natasha Shneider&#x27;s life at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on August 16, 2008. They were joined on stage by Shneider&#x27;s husband Alain Johannes, Tenacious D, Matt Cameron, Brody Dalle, Jesse Hughes, Chris Goss, and PJ Harvey, playing a variety of QOTSA and non-QOTSA songs, including covers of songs from bands such as Cream and The Doors. Tenacious D and Harvey also performed acoustic sets at the show. Proceeds from the concert went to defray the costs associated with Shneider&#x27;s treatment.

On August 22 and 23, 2008, Queens of the Stone Age performed the last shows of their &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot; tour at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK, and Josh Homme announced in an interview with the BBC and during the show that he would be returning to the studio to work on the next album.

=== Homme&#x27;s health issues, debut re-release and promotional tour (2009–2011) ===
During 2009 and 2010, band members worked on side projects during the down time. Troy Van Leeuwen started up a new band, Sweethead. Joey Castillo played for Eagles of Death Metal on their &quot;Heart On&quot; tour. Bassist Michael Shuman continued his work as drummer and vocalist with Mini Mansions, while Dean Fertita became the guitarist/keyboardist for Jack White&#x27;s newest group, The Dead Weather. Josh Homme formed supergroup Them Crooked Vultures with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones. After Them Crooked Vultures finished touring in June, the band toured and released a two-CD deluxe edition of &quot;Rated R&quot; on August 3, 2010. This edition featured the original CD along with six B-sides and live recordings from the band&#x27;s Reading performance in 2000.

In 2010, Homme suffered from complications during a botched knee surgery, during which his heart stopped for a short time due to asphyxiation; doctors had to use a defibrillator to revive him. Following this, he was bedridden for four months and plunged into a deep depression, during which he considered giving up his music career altogether. He elaborated on this experience further in an interview on Marc Maron&#x27;s WTF podcast, explaining that he had contracted a methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) infection which his immune system could not fight due to stress. Homme has since said that the experience contributed greatly to the writing and recording of &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;.

After Homme recovered, Queens of the Stone Age released a remastered version of their self-titled debut album in early 2011, and performed the album in its entirety in a promotional tour. The band performed on &quot;Conan&quot; on April 14, and later played at the Australian music festival Soundwave. Throughout the summer of 2011, the band appeared at various European festivals, including the Glastonbury Festival, in Somerset, UK. They also played at Pearl Jam&#x27;s 20th Anniversary Festival at Alpine Valley in East Troy, WI on September 3 and 4, 2011, which would be their last with drummer Joey Castillo.

===Matador Records trilogy (2011–present)===
====&quot;...Like Clockwork&quot; (2011–2014)====

Plans to record a follow-up to &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot; had been mentioned since 2008, but recording would not begin until August 2012. In March 2011, Homme stated, &quot;Doing the rehearsals for the first record is really defining the new one. It&#x27;s been turning the new record into something else. What we were doing was bluesy, and now it&#x27;s turned into this trancey, broken thing. The robots are coming home!&quot; According to Homme, the album would be finished by the end of 2012. He explained to BBC Radio 1, &quot;We&#x27;re going to take our one last break that we would get for a month, come back and do Glastonbury, then immediately jump in the studio. Our record will be done by the end of the year. We have enough songs.&quot;

In November 2011, Alain Johannes stated in regard to his studio work with the band: &quot;We had a late night with Queens of the Stone Age again. [...] Just putting in days, super top secret, but it&#x27;s going to be amazing. I&#x27;m really excited about it. [...] Once we start the process, it goes to completion. So I can&#x27;t say exactly when, but it&#x27;s a really good start.&quot;

On August 20, 2012, the band stated via a Facebook status update that they were &quot;recording&quot; their new album.

In September 2012, it was revealed that Homme and producer Dave Sardy co-wrote and recorded a song entitled &quot;Nobody To Love,&quot; which is featured during the end credits of the film &quot;End of Watch&quot;.

In November 2012, Homme informed BBC&#x27;s Zane Lowe that Joey Castillo had left the band and that drums on the new album would be performed by Dave Grohl, who also performed on &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;. Homme also confirmed with Lowe that the album would be released prior to their performance at the Download Festival in June 2013. In addition to Grohl, other former members contributing to the album include former bassists Nick Oliveri and Johannes, and vocalist Mark Lanegan.

A number of collaborations from different musicians were announced for ...&quot;Like Clockwork&quot;, including Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears, Brody Dalle, and Elton John.

In early 2013, Homme and fellow Queens contributors including Alain Johannes and Chris Goss recorded for the soundtrack of Dave Grohl&#x27;s &quot;Sound City: Real to Reel&quot;. Goss, Johannes and Homme were on three tracks each. Homme&#x27;s notably included a collaboration with Grohl and Trent Reznor called Mantra, and he was also featured in the film in an interview segment. Goss and Johannes were both featured members in the Sound City Players, playing Masters of Reality, Eleven, and Desert Sessions songs, as well as their penned tunes from the soundtrack. Former Kyuss bassist Scott Reeder also contributed to the soundtrack.

In March 2013, Queens of the Stone Age announced that the new album, entitled &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;, would be released in June 2013 on Matador Records. A press release, issued by Matador at 9:00am EST on March 26, 2013, revealed further details of the album, including further guest appearances: Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys and UNKLE&#x27;s James Lavelle. In addition to Grohl&#x27;s contribution, the record also features performances by former drummer Castillo, as well as tracks by new drummer Jon Theodore (ex-The Mars Volta, One Day as a Lion). Queens of the Stone Age premiered a new song, &quot;My God Is The Sun&quot;, at Lollapalooza Brasil on March 30, 2013, a performance in which Theodore made his live debut. The studio version of the song premiered on Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 program on April 8, 2013.

&quot;...Like Clockwork&quot; was released on June 3, 2013, on Matador Records in the UK and on June 4 in the United States. Self-produced by the band, it is the first Queens of the Stone Age album to feature full contributions from bassist Michael Shuman and keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita. The album debuted in the number one position in the US and is the first QOTSA album to achieve this ranking.

Following a performance by QOTSA at the Jay Z-owned Made In America Festival in the summer of 2013, Homme made comments about the rap star during a radio interview with CBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Strombo Show&quot;. Homme explained that his band was frisked by the event&#x27;s security team prior to the performance and referred to Jay Z&#x27;s personal interaction with the band as a marketing stunt. Homme stated:

The &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot; tour culminated with a Halloween party at The Forum in Los Angeles, featuring guests such as The Kills, JD McPherson and Nick Oliveri&#x27;s band Uncontrollable. The band&#x27;s performance featured an appearance from Oliveri who played songs with them during the encore set, including songs such as &quot;Auto Pilot&quot; and &quot;Quick and to the Pointless&quot; which had not been performed in a decade.

====&quot;Villains&quot; (2014–2018)====
The band performed with Nine Inch Nails, Lindsey Buckingham and Dave Grohl at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. The band went on a joint headline tour of Australia with Nine Inch Nails in 2014.

In January 2014, Homme told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine the band would start recording a new album when they finished their tour for &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;. In June 2014, Homme performed a solo acoustic show at James Lavelle&#x27;s Meltdown festival, featuring guest performances from Troy Van Leeuwen and Mark Lanegan. During this gig, Homme played a new song called &quot;Villains of Circumstance,&quot; which was performed again at another acoustic set in 2016. The band indicated in February 2015, when it was announced they are to play Rock in Rio 2015 in Rio de Janeiro in September, that they were about to record a new album. Despite this, in March 2016, Michael Shuman revealed that the band were on a break.

During this period, the members of the band worked on various other projects. Josh Homme and Dean Fertita contributed to Iggy Pop&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Post Pop Depression&quot; and subsequent tour, while Troy van Leeuwen joined the rock supergroup Gone Is Gone with plans to release an EP and a studio album. In May 2016, Van Leeuwen announced plans to record Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;sometime this year.&quot;

In January 2017, Troy Sanders from Mastodon and Gone Is Gone said Queens of the Stone Age will release a new album later in the year. Following this, the band posted several photos on social media featuring their studio and announced that they would be performing at the Fuji Rock Festival in July, their first performance in Japan since 2003. The band updated their social media accounts with a new logo and the words &quot;Coming Twentyfive&quot; on April 6, 2017, and announced a tour of Australia and New Zealand to begin in July.

On June 14, 2017, Queens of the Stone Age announced their new album &quot;Villains&quot; which was released on August 25, 2017. The teaser trailer took the form of a comedy skit featuring the band performing a polygraph test with Liam Lynch along with an appearance of the album&#x27;s producer Mark Ronson, and featured a snippet of the song &quot;Feet Don&#x27;t Fail Me.&quot; The first single, &quot;The Way You Used to Do,&quot; was released the following day along with the announcement of a world tour. The second advance single from the album, &quot;The Evil Has Landed,&quot; was released August 10, 2017.

On October 24, 2017, as part of the &quot;Villains&quot; tour, the band headlined Madison Square Garden for the first time, having opened for Nine Inch Nails there in 2005, and for Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2003. Homme said he was &quot;stoked&quot;. Three sets of free tickets to this show were hidden at three stations along the Q line of the New York City Subway.

On December 9, 2017, while on stage during the KROQ Acoustic Christmas concert in Inglewood, California, Homme kicked a photographer&#x27;s camera into her face, resulting in injuries for which she later received medical treatment. Homme, who was under the influence of alcohol at the time, later apologized through a video on the band&#x27;s Instagram page, saying, &quot;I hope you&#x27;re okay, and I&#x27;m truly sorry. And I understand you have to do whatever you have to do. I just want you to know that I&#x27;m sorry. Goodnight, godspeed.&quot;

====&quot;In Times New Roman...&quot; (2019–present)====
In an interview with &quot;eonmusic&quot; in June 2019, Billy Gibbons announced that he has contributed to a new Queens of the Stone Age album that is set to be further announced by Homme later in the future. Gibbons also confirmed that Dave Grohl is involved in the recording sessions. Grohl denied the rumors, saying that he and Homme had only spent time together &quot;riding motorcycles and eating waffles.&quot;

In early May 2023, rumors began to surface of the album when a product listing appeared on the band&#x27;s website titled &quot;In Times New Roman...&quot;, including an album cover and tracklist. The listing was initially removed.

On May 11, the album&#x27;s first single &quot;Emotion Sickness&quot; was released, along with an official announcement of the album. On May 31, the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Carnavoyeur&quot; was released. On June 14, the third and final single &quot;Paper Machete&quot; was released, immediately followed by the release of the album on June 16.

In early June, Queens of the Stone Age announced an extensive North American tour called &quot;The End Is Nero Tour&quot;, immediately followed by a full European leg with dates until late November 2023. This was followed a 2024 tour that included Australia, New Zealand and North America, and Europe. On July 9, the band cancelled several European shows that month so Homme could have emergency surgery, and they cancelled more later that month. Jack White filled in their slot for some festivals. On August 23, the remainder of the band&#x27;s 2024 shows were cancelled or postponed to 2025 due to Homme needing &quot;essential medical care for the remainder of the year&quot;.

==Musical style==
Throughout its career, the band has been described as alternative rock, stoner rock, alternative metal, and hard rock. Homme has called the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album driving music, angular and recorded dry; its songs feature solid, repetitive riffs. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine also noted a &quot;connection between American meat-and-potatoes macho rock of the early 1970s, like Blue Cheer and Grand Funk Railroad, and the precision-timing drones in German rock of the same period.&quot; The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Rated R&quot;, has a wider variety of instruments, several recording guests, and lead vocals shared by Homme, Oliveri and Lanegan. Homme has said, &quot;Our first record announced our sound. This one added that we&#x27;re different and weird.&quot; The band continued to experiment on its third album, &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, which also featured a lineup of three lead vocalists, many guest appearances, and wide range of instrumentation, including horn and string sections. Homme has called &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot; a &quot;dark&quot; album, which includes imagery inspired by The Brothers Grimm folk and fairy tales. In 2005, Homme said, &quot;Where the poetry seems to be is when you start in the dark and reach for the light—that&#x27;s what makes it not depressing to me&quot;. The album changed gears from the band&#x27;s previous distinct &quot;driving&quot; sound, in large part due to Oliveri&#x27;s departure. The band almost exclusively used semi-hollow body guitars on the record. With &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot; the band continued to develop its signature sound with more dance-oriented elements and electronic influences, while Homme became the only lead vocalist and used more distinct vocal melodies.

Homme has on numerous occasions described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;rock versions of electronic music&quot;, saying he takes inspiration from the repetitive nature of electronic trance music along with various forms of dance music, hip hop, trip hop and Krautrock. He called this heavy rock style mixed with the structure of electronic music &quot;robot rock&quot; in an interview with KUNO-TV at the 2001 Roskilde Festival.

Homme has described aspects of his distinctive guitar playing style. He demonstrated the &quot;Josh Homme scale&quot;, which he said was the result of years playing and altering the blues scale. The scale has the intervals 1, b3, 3, b5, 5, 6, b7. His scale is the half whole scale with the second degree (b2) omitted. In the same interview, Homme referenced some earlier influences on his playing, citing both polka guitar styles and the techniques of Jimi Hendrix.

<text>Queens of the Stone Age is the debut studio album by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age, released by Loosegroove Records on September 22, 1998. It was primarily written and recorded in April 1998 by founding member Josh Homme and his former Kyuss bandmate Alfredo Hernández, with Hernández playing drums and Homme singing and playing the rest of the instruments. Homme also produced the album alongside Joe Barresi. Bassist Nick Oliveri, also a former member of Kyuss, would join the band by the time of the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, who placed it in the stoner rock genre and drew comparisons to krautrock bands such as Neu! and Can, as well as to Kyuss and other metal bands.

In 2011, Homme reissued &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; through his Rekords Rekords label, having it remastered and adding three additional tracks–two from the album&#x27;s recording sessions and one from two years earlier. The reissue received a positive critical response and was accompanied by a supporting concert tour. Working on the reissue and subsequent tour also inspired part of the band&#x27;s approach to recording its sixth album, &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;, released in 2013. In 2022, the album was reissued again on Matador Records with its original LP artwork.

==Background and recording==
Following the breakup of Kyuss in 1995, guitarist Josh Homme recorded new material in Seattle with producer Chris Goss, bassist Van Conner, and drummer Victor Indrizzo under the name Gamma Ray. The results, including the song &quot;If Only Everything&quot;, were released as the &quot;Gamma Ray&quot; EP in 1996. Homme subsequently toured as a guitarist with Screaming Trees and started The Desert Sessions, a series of jam sessions involving many musicians including former Kyuss drummer Alfredo Hernández. The song &quot;Avon&quot; originated from the Desert Sessions, appearing on &quot;Volume 3&quot; in 1998. After receiving a cease and desist order because the name Gamma Ray was already in use by a German band, Homme changed the name to Queens of the Stone Age. The &quot;Gamma Ray&quot; material was re-released in 1997 on the &quot;Kyuss / Queens of the Stone Age&quot; split EP, along with the additional track &quot;Spiders and Vinegaroons&quot; from the &quot;Gamma Ray&quot; sessions; the release featured some of the final studio recordings by Kyuss while debuting the &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; moniker for Homme&#x27;s new project.

Reflecting on this period in 2011, Homme remarked:

The first ten tracks on &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; were recorded in April 1998 at Monkey Studios in Homme&#x27;s hometown of Palm Desert, California. Hernández played drums on the tracks and Goss performed on &quot;You Would Know&quot; and &quot;Give the Mule What He Wants&quot;, playing bass guitar and singing backing vocals. Homme sang lead vocals and played the rest of the instruments on the recordings, crediting himself under the pseudonym &quot;Carlo&quot; for his bass guitar, keyboard, and piano work. He also served as a producer on the album, alongside Joe Barresi. The &quot;Gamma Ray&quot; song &quot;If Only Everything&quot; was re-recorded during these sessions and its title shortened to &quot;If Only&quot;, and the Desert Sessions song &quot;Avon&quot; was also re-recorded. &quot;I Was a Teenage Hand Model&quot; was recorded separately at Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California, with the studio&#x27;s personnel contributing as performers: studio owner Fred Drake sang and played drums, co-owner Dave Catching played percussion, and sound engineer Patrick &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson played piano. Former Dinosaur Jr. bassist Mike Johnson is credited with &quot;sofa&quot; on the track. Hutch, who served as live sound engineer for both Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age, is credited as a member of the group on the album, with the roles &quot;FOH&quot; (front of house), &quot;guru&quot;, &quot;HardWalls&quot;, and &quot;back of door&quot;.

The album&#x27;s recordings were mixed by Barresi and mastered by Dan Hersch at DigiPrep in Hollywood. The image for the album cover was taken from the 1972 book &quot;The Pin-Up: A Modest History&quot; by Mark Gabor, featuring Trinidadian-British model Sylvia Bayo. Photographs for the liner notes were taken by Tony Tornay, while the back cover photograph was taken by rock photographer Lisa Johnson; it shows Hernández, Homme, and former Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri, the latter of whom joined Queens of the Stone Age just prior to the album&#x27;s release and would remain with the band until 2004. Oliveri also appears in the album&#x27;s closing moments, in a recorded answering machine message to Homme in which he agrees to join the band. Homme created the layout for the album&#x27;s packaging with graphic artist Frank Kozik.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, reviewer Kitty Empire scored it 8 out of 10, comparing it to Kyuss and saying that &quot;for all its indisputable primitive charms, &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; is actually a step forward in stoner evolution. The guitars are still flint-hard, the tunes still load-bearing. But the sound roaring out of the speakers is far sleeker and more hypnotic than the dumb chug that stoner rock has periodically devolved into in Homme&#x27;s absence. The excellent &#x27;Regular John&#x27; sounds almost motorik, as though Neu! had level billing with [Black] Sabbath one strange night. There are keyboards and maracas on the very un-stone age &#x27;I Was a Teenage Hand Model&#x27;. And Homme—who didn&#x27;t sing in Kyuss—frequently swaps his bone-dry metallic tones for something a little more soulful on songs like &#x27;You Can&#x27;t Quit Me Baby&#x27;.&quot; Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B− rating, remarking that the band &quot;delivers a workmanlike collection of heavy music that&#x27;s just a bit too cerebral to fall under the stoner rock rubric (Fu Manchu). &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; is intermittently potent, but when you hear the ripped-off &#x27;If Only&#x27; (a.k.a. the Stooges&#x27; &#x27;I Wanna Be Your Dog&#x27;), you can&#x27;t help but think QOTSA might be a great band—if only they could write a song that good on their own.&quot;

James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album four stars out of five and commented that the band had &quot;found a vital place between art-metal seriousness and pop pleasure. It begins right away with the trancelike &#x27;Regular John&#x27;, a track that layers Homme&#x27;s yelping guitar accents over a fuzzy groove. While other metalheads play around with sequencers, Queens of the Stone Age have something a little more heated and classical in mind. The rest of the album charges on with its compelling contrasts between Homme&#x27;s papery vocals and the surrounding rampage. Sometimes the songs explore pure heaviness, as on the wall-rattling &#x27;Walkin&#x27; on the Sidewalks&#x27;. But more often they thrillingly toy with elements like vocal hooks (&#x27;You Would Know&#x27;) and metal frenzy (&#x27;How to Handle a Rope&#x27;) without giving in to either.&quot; Writing in &quot;Spin&quot;, Joe Gross scored &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; 7 out of 10, saying &quot;While there&#x27;s really nothing in this collection worth trading in those Melvins albums for, it&#x27;s strangely compelling to hear how Homme and his cohorts killed many an afternoon in a thick THC haze with Can&#x27;s &quot;Tago Mago&quot;, then worked it into their patented pedal abuse.&quot;

Reviewing the album after Queens of the Stone Age had gained mainstream success with 2000&#x27;s &quot;Rated R&quot; and 2002&#x27;s &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic remarked: &quot;Hearing Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s long out of print debut many years after its initial 1998 release does pack the shock of revelation: Josh Homme&#x27;s tightly wound blueprint for QOTSA was in place from the very beginning. [...] There is sex and swagger to &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot;, there&#x27;s a swing to the rhythms, there&#x27;s a darkly enveloping carnal menace buttressed by muscle and lust that keeps the album from being an insular stoner headpiece. Certainly, there&#x27;s enough sinewy force to suggest the mighty brawn of &quot;Rated R&quot; and &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;; Homme retained enough of the desert spaciness of Kyuss to give &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; an otherworldly shimmer, a hazy quality he later abandoned for aggressive precision, so this winds up as a unique record in his catalog, a place where you can hear Homme&#x27;s past and future intertwining.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau viewed the album negatively, however, rating it a &quot;dud&quot; in his &quot;Consumer&#x27;s Guide&quot; column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

&quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; was eventually certified silver in the United Kingdom in February 2006, for sales exceeding 60,000 copies. It was listed in the 2010 reference book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, the only Queens of the Stone Age album to be included.

==Reissue==
Following a &quot;deluxe edition&quot; reissue of &quot;Rated R&quot; in 2010, Homme announced that the band would reissue &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; as well, stating that the album had become &quot;impossible to get, it&#x27;d been outta print for so long. I&#x27;m not very nostalgic by nature, so it wasn&#x27;t like &#x27;guys, remember the days&#x27;, it was more like in the internet age this record should be able to get got, you know? I really like this band Cheap Trick, and they were doing shows where they were playing their first three records three nights in a row, and so we started talking about &#x27;wow, OK, we&#x27;ll never get a chance to re-release this thing, and what if we just focused on the first record? I dunno if that means we&#x27;re going to play it exactly start to finish. We haven&#x27;t really decided. It&#x27;s kind of a cool idea. [...] I&#x27;m just glad that it&#x27;s not like some bad haircut when I listen to it. I&#x27;ve listened to it, and I love that record, and it&#x27;s been really fun to try to put myself back in that headspace where I was just obsessed with trying to trance out on guitar.&quot;

The album was remastered by Brian Gardner for the reissue. The title of the song &quot;How to Handle a Rope&quot; was extended to &quot;How to Handle a Rope (A Lesson in the Lariat)&quot;, and three additional tracks were added in between the album&#x27;s existing tracks: &quot;The Bronze&quot; and &quot;These Aren&#x27;t the Droids You&#x27;re Looking For&quot;, which were from the album&#x27;s recording sessions and had originally been released in 1998 on &quot;The Split CD&quot; (a split release with Dutch band Beaver), and &quot;Spiders and Vinegaroons&quot; from the &quot;Gamma Ray&quot; sessions, which had been released on the &quot;Kyuss / Queens of the Stone Age&quot; split EP in 1997. The reissue was released through Homme&#x27;s label, Rekords Rekords, with distribution through Domino Recording Company. The band, which by then consisted of Homme, guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, bassist Michael Shuman, drummer Joey Castillo, and keyboardist Dean Fertita, scheduled a tour in support of the album&#x27;s reissue.
The re-release prompted a new round of critical reception for &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot;. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the reissue received an average score of 78% based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Greg Moffitt of BBC Music remarked that &quot;Although less varied and dynamic than &quot;Rated R&quot;, &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot; simply crackles with energy. At its best, it&#x27;s just as electrifying, even if it doesn&#x27;t maintain the dizzying momentum which rolled its follow-up to instant glory. Musically, it draws deeply from diverse pools, echoes of &#x27;70s hard rock reverberating alongside alternative, grunge, and stoner rock sounds, the latter of which mainman Josh Homme pioneered with his former band Kyuss.&quot; Chuck Eddy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it 4 stars out of 5, saying that &quot;When the debut by Queens of the Stone Age sneaked out in 1998, it seemed like a lark: Josh Homme and Alfredo Hernández from Kyuss, tired of frying sludge metal in the desert sun, were now subjecting reborn acid rock to mechanical repetition. Soon, QOTSA would become a real band, with real hits. But they&#x27;d never again groove like this, with gurgling Teutonic drones swallowing Stooges chords and intercepted radio cross talk.&quot; For &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, reviewer Karina Halle gave it a B grade and complimented the &quot;very slight hand&quot; of the remastering job: &quot;Comparing the two albums side-by-side, you can hear a nice tonality in the re-release, a sharper, crisper quality that just wasn&#x27;t holding up in the 1998 version. However, part of QOTSA&#x27;s vital sound is the thickness of Josh Homme&#x27;s guitar, the fuzz and grain that permeates from each riff and solo. That is still present, it&#x27;s just a more precise distortion.&quot; She also praised the added tracks, saying &quot;All three of the bonus tracks slink in perfectly with the rest of the album, adding to the overall feel instead of subtracting from it.&quot;

For &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;, Noel Gardner scored the reissue 8 out of 10, saying that the remastering &quot;has actually made a palpable difference to the plumpness of the bass in songs like &#x27;Hispanic Impressions, but that the extra tracks &quot;haven&#x27;t ruined it or anything daft, but also aren&#x27;t cooking at the level of most of the actual album, and would have been better placed on one of Homme&#x27;s jam-heavy and &#x27;zany&#x27; Desert Sessions releases from the time.&quot; Stuart Berman of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; also scored it 8 out of 10, but praised the added tracks, opining that &quot;It&#x27;s not often that padding out an already hefty album actually improves it, but in the Queens&#x27; case, the revised tracklist provides a more accurate portrait of how the band molded its mercurial Desert Sessions experiments into chiseled hard-rock monoliths. At the same time, the expanded edition makes the Queens&#x27; debut feel a little less like a time capsule, and closer in spirit to the playful sprawl of their subsequent best-sellers.&quot; In &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Stuart Branson gave the release 7 stars out of 10, remarking that the added tracks &quot;are worked into the original album sequencing as if they were always there. They provide no revelation, though they do alter somewhat the feel of the album&quot; and concluding that &quot;The best songs are really good; and the other songs sound sort of like their best songs, just slightly less good. And everything remains in this meaty swath of goodness. This rerelease proves that it was always really Homme&#x27;s personal vision (he even plays bass on this album); it was always sure, and not much has changed.&quot; For &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Austin L. Ray graded the reissue a B− and opined that &quot;It&#x27;s interesting to revisit the band&#x27;s debut after four more albums and a dozen years, only to find it downright primitive by comparison. [...] It&#x27;s a kind-of-quaint look at a band that knew what it wanted to do, but hadn&#x27;t quite figured out how to do it yet. Some songs hint at the tightness the Queens rhythm section would one day embody (&#x27;Regular John&#x27;), while directionless noodling and farting synths weigh down the otherwise-taut songwriting that would one day manifest itself in pop gems like &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret&quot; and &quot;No One Knows&quot;. All the elements are here, though they&#x27;re on the darker end of the coal/diamond spectrum, and the mostly unremarkable bonus tracks don&#x27;t do the set any favors. But when it&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s damn good, and through the murk, there&#x27;s the sound of a band that would one day be truly great.&quot;

<text>Nabû-nāṣir was the king of Babylon from 747 to 734 BC. He deposed a foreign Chaldean usurper named Nabu-shuma-ishkun, bringing native rule back to Babylon after twenty-three years of Chaldean rule. His reign saw the beginning of a new era characterized by the systematic maintenance of chronologically precise historical records. Both the Babylonian Chronicle and the Ptolemaic Canon begin with his accession to the throne. He was contemporary with the Assyrian kings Aššur-nirarī V (755–745 BC) and Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BC), under the latter of whom he became a vassal, and the Elamite kings Humban-Tahrah I (reigned until 743 BC) and Humban-Nikaš I (742–717 BC).

==Attestations and possible vituperative chronicle==

Nothing is known of his provenance or origin, although it appears he was a native Mesopotamian. His three predecessors were from the migrant Chaldean tribes settled in the far south east of Babylonia since the 9th century BC. The &quot;Dynastic Chronicle&quot; may have been composed during his reign as it records the succession of kings from the antediluvian era down to his immediate predecessor, Nabû-šuma-iškun. It records that the &quot;dynasty of Chaldea was terminated&quot; (with Nabû-šuma-iškun) and &quot;its kingship was transferred,&quot; but the remainder is lost. He may also have commissioned a vituperative chronicle which vilifies his predecessor for his sacrilegious actions and the &quot;Chronicle of the Market Prices&quot; which mentions the volatile costs of various commodities in reigns up until that of his predecessor. His name appears in the &quot;Eclectic Chronicle&quot; but the context has not been preserved.

==Calendar reform==

His reign marks the reform of the Babylonian calendar, introducing regular calculated intercalary months, the eighteen-year cycle texts (the 223-month Saros Cycle, named for Edmund Halley’s misreading of a passage in Pliny) and perhaps even the zodiac. Berossus of Kos reported, in an account preserved by Syncellus, that it was from the reign of Nabû-nāṣir onward that the movements and duration of the stars were recorded. He noted in his work &quot;Babyloniaca&quot; that: &quot;He gathered the records of his predecessors and destroyed them, thus ensuring that the history of the Chaldean kings began with him.&quot;

According to Claudius Ptolemy in his work &quot;Almagest&quot;, this gave rise to an era beginning at noon on 26 February 747 BC, when the &quot;Anno Nabonassari&quot; began, but prior to the Hellenistic period there is no trace of this era. &quot;The Babylonian Chronicle&quot;, covering the years 747 to 668 BC, the best preserved exemplar of this genre, was possibly collated from Babylonian astronomical diaries, although the earliest exemplar of these dates to 652 BC. The lists of celestial phenomena started with the lunar eclipse of 747–746 BC (6 February 747 BC according to Britton and others), a spectacular conjunction of the moon and the planets which may have inspired the commencement of recording of accurate astronomical observations.

==Assyrian invasion==
The country regained from Nabû-šuma-iškun was one riven by internal divisions and conflicts with the immigrant tribes of Arameans and Chaldeans, where the central authority was greatly diminished.

In Nabû-nāṣir&#x27;s third year, the Assyrian general &quot;Tukultī-apil-Ešarra&quot;, better known under the Hebraic rendition &quot;Tiglath-Pileser III&quot;, came to power in the Neo-Assyrian Empire, overthrowing the existing regime, and in the first of two campaigns to secure his southern and eastern frontiers invaded Babylonia. During the first of these (745 BC) he sacked Rabbilu and Hamranu, abducted the gods of Šapazza, subjugated the numerous Aramean and Chaldean tribes, and destroyed the capital of the Chaldean tribe the Bit-Shilani, Sarrabanu, impaling its leader, Nabû-ušabši. His forces skirted the metropolitan areas of Dur-Kurigalzu and Sippar and may have reached as far as the region of Nippur.

Whether or not he actually solicited military aid from the Assyrians, Nabû-nāṣir seems to have been the main beneficiary of these actions as his regime was stabilized and he was subsequently able to put down a revolt in Borsippa. His hold over Uruk remained tenuous, as two local dignitaries complained of the neglect of the Akītu temple in their inscription commemorating their own restorations, usurping monarchic privilege.

==Economic activity==
Twenty-three tablets survive dealing with agricultural production, animal husbandry, weaving and sales from his first to his fourteenth year and these seem to represent a recovery in economic activity. A letter archive excavated in 1973 in Nippur contains the correspondence between Kudurru the &quot;šandabakku&quot;, or governor, of Nippur and an individual of this name who is greeted as &quot;brother&quot;, which may be him.

He is recorded as having succumbed to illness and died in his palace during the fourteenth year of his reign. He was succeeded by his son, Nabû-nādin-zēri, the only known hereditary succession in Babylonia in a period from 810 BC to the rise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 626 BC.

==Etymology==
Inscribed in cuneiform as d or d&quot;ir&quot;, Greek: Ναβονάσσαρος, whence &quot;Nabonassar&quot;, and meaning &quot;Nabû (is) protector&quot;.

<doc id="159123" wikidata="Q586984" url="?curid=159123" title="Songs for the Deaf">
<text>Songs for the Deaf is the third studio album by the American rock band Queens of the Stone Age, released on August 27, 2002, by Interscope Records. It features guest musicians including Dave Grohl on drums, and was the last Queens of the Stone Age album to feature Nick Oliveri on bass. &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; is a loose concept album, taking the listener on a drive through the California desert from Los Angeles to Joshua Tree, tuning into radio stations from towns along the way such as Banning and Chino Hills.

&quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; received critical acclaim and earned Queens of the Stone Age their first gold certification in the United States. One million copies were sold in Europe, earning a platinum certification from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry in 2008. &quot;No One Knows&quot;, &quot;Go with the Flow&quot; and &quot;First It Giveth&quot; were released as singles.

==Contributors==
&quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; was the first Queens of the Stone Age album that featured Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters on drums, who also toured with the band. He replaced drummer Gene Trautmann, who started working on other projects. Grohl had admired Queens of the Stone Age since they opened for Foo Fighters, and had wanted to appear on their previous album &quot;Rated R&quot;. Guitarist Josh Homme, with whom he had been friends since 1992, while Homme was the guitarist for Kyuss, invited him to join in October 2000. Grohl admitted that he had not drummed for a long time and added that fronting a band was &quot;tiring&quot;.

&quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; was the last appearance on a Queens of the Stone Age record by Brendon McNichol (lap steel) and Gene Trautmann (drums). It was also the last album to feature bassist and vocalist Nick Oliveri as a full-time member, as he was fired following the tour. The album also included the first musical contribution to a Queens of the Stone Age album by multi-instrumentalists Natasha Shneider and Alain Johannes. Shneider and Johannes, alongside Songs for the Deaf touring recruits Castillo and Troy Van Leeuwen of Failure and A Perfect Circle would subsequently become full-time Queens of the Stone Age members and contribute to the follow-up album &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot;, released in 2005.

Rounding out the core recording lineup of Homme, Oliveri, and Grohl, was singer/songwriter Mark Lanegan, formerly of Screaming Trees, a band that Homme had toured with previously. Lanegan joined the band as a full-time member in 2001 after having guested on the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Rated R&quot;, and provided additional songwriting and lyrics, in addition to lead vocals on several songs.

== Production ==
Several songs on the album are reworked versions of tracks previously recorded and released in the Desert Sessions, a side project of Homme with various guest collaborators. &quot;You Think I Ain&#x27;t Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire&quot; was the opening track of &quot;Volume 5: Poetry for the Masses (Sea Shed Shit Head by the She Sore)&quot;, with vocals originally performed by Mario Lalli instead of Oliveri. &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tree&quot; first appeared on &quot;Volume 7: Gypsy Marches&quot;. &quot;Song for the Deaf&quot; and &quot;Go with the Flow&quot; were previously performed as early as 2001 with the former having very different lyrics and vocals completely by Mark Lanegan. The main riff for &quot;No One Knows&quot; comes from the Desert Sessions track &quot;Cold Sore Superstars&quot;.

Grohl&#x27;s drums were recorded in a small, &quot;dead&quot;-sounding isolation booth, to create a &quot;tight, focused, punchy and kind of claustrophobic&quot; sound. To allow for greater flexibility in positioning microphones, the cymbals were recorded separately. To achieve this, Grohl performed each song twice; for the initial pass without cymbals, he hit electronic cymbal pads, then repeated the performance with real cymbals but a dummy snare and padded toms, so only the cymbals made noise. The takes were then blended. The engineer Eric Valentine credited Grohl for his patience in the process, which he described as &quot;very difficult&quot;. In October 2001, while the album was being recorded, Grohl said &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; was his favorite album that he had played drums on.

Homme said the use of fake radio segments gave the album &quot;fluidity&quot;. Oliveri said they were a jibe at &quot;how a lot of stations play the same thing over and over. We don&#x27;t get played on the radio, so I figure we should talk shit about them.&quot;

== Artwork ==
The cover art for the US double LP version of the album is different from the CD version, featuring a red Q (with a sperm cell as the line in the Q and an egg cell as the circle) on a black background with no other text. It was released on red vinyl. The UK vinyl version cover is the same as the CD cover except with the colors reversed. The person on the album disc is musician Dave Catching, who performs on the album.

Both the CD and LP cover have a Parental Advisory seal on most copies, due to the word &quot;fuck&quot; appearing in the tracks &quot;Song for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Song for the Deaf&quot; and &quot;Six Shooter&quot;, as well as for the violent lyrics of the latter track.

There were also three different album covers that were made for the CD version of &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;. All of the interior artwork for each of the three versions is the same, but there were covers printed in red, magenta, and orange. The most common copy of the album sleeve is the red cover.

== Release and promotion ==

In September 2002, Homme explained the band&#x27;s goals with the release of the album:

The album was planned for release on August 13, 2002, but was postponed for two weeks. Grohl put Foo Fighters on hiatus and delayed their upcoming album &quot;One by One&quot; to October 2002 to tour for &quot;Songs For the Deaf&quot;. His first performance with the band was at March 7, 2002 at the Troubadour, Los Angeles, and his last was at the Fuji Rock Festival on July 28. He returned to Foo Fighters, with Danzig drummer Joey Castillo announced as his replacement in August 2002.

==Reception==
&quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; was Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s breakout album and garnered the band international recognition. Upon its worldwide release in late August 2002, the album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200 album chart.

&quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; received critical acclaim and is often cited as the band&#x27;s greatest album to date. On Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 from aggregated critic reviews, &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; is assigned a score of 89, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, making the album the third highest-rated on the site from 2002. Josh Tyrangiel of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;the year&#x27;s best hard-rock album&quot;, giving it an A. &quot;Splendid&quot; said &quot;the bottom line is that QOTSA turns in another genre-demolishing, hard-as-titanium album in &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;. This is not your father&#x27;s metal. It&#x27;s better.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; listed the album as the year&#x27;s third best. &quot;Kludge&quot; ranked it at number six on their list of best albums of 2002. &quot;NME&quot; placed the album as the sixth best, with the three singles each making the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Tracks of the Year&quot; list over the course of 2002/2003. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; rated the album at number 1 on its &quot;Best albums of 2002&quot; list.
Music critic Steven Hyden called the album the greatest hard-rock record of the 21st century.

The album earned the band&#x27;s first gold certification in the US on January 27, 2003, shifting over 500,000 copies. It was certified platinum in the UK on September 20, 2002, with sales exceeding 100,000 copies, and platinum in Canada. As of June 2007 the total amount of sold copies in the US is estimated at 1,186,000, according to Nielsen Soundscan.

The album received two Best Hard Rock Performance Grammy nominations for singles &quot;No One Knows&quot; (2002), and &quot;Go with the Flow&quot; (2003).

To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of its &quot;Hottest 100&quot; poll, Australian radio station Triple J ran a &quot;Hottest 100 of the last 20 years&quot; poll in June 2013. Songs that were released between 1994 and 2013 were eligible for the poll and &quot;No One Knows&quot; was voted into eleventh position.

<text>Tourism forms an important part of the economy of Austria, accounting for almost 9% of the Austrian gross domestic product. Austria has one guest bed for every six inhabitants, and boasts the highest per capita income from tourism in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As of 2007, the total number of tourist overnight stays is roughly the same for summer and winter season, with peaks in February and July/August.

In 2007, Austria ranked 9th worldwide in international tourism receipts, with 18.9 billion US$. In international tourist arrivals, Austria ranked 12th with 30.8 million tourists.

== Most visited areas ==
Vienna attracts a major part of tourists, both in summer and winter. Salzburg receives about a fifth of tourist overnight stays compared to Vienna, which ranks it 2nd in the summer season. In the winter season, a number of winter sport resorts in western Austria overtake Salzburg in the number of tourist overnight stays: Sölden, Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Ischgl, Sankt Anton am Arlberg, and Obertauern.

Visits to Austria mostly include trips to Vienna with its cathedral, its &quot;Heurigen&quot; (wine pubs) and romantic Waltz music events. Worth a visit are Salzburg, birthplace of Mozart, Innsbruck, capital of Tyrol surrounded by the Alps, Linz, capital of Upper Austria with the largest Cathedral of Austria and modern cultural highlights, and the Danube valley with its vineyards, for example the Wachau or Dunkelsteinerwald, which are between Melk and Krems. In the western part of the country the province Vorarlberg reaches the Lake Constance, in the eastern part Neusiedler See. The three most visited landmarks in Austria are Schönbrunn Palace (2,590,000 visitors per year), Tiergarten Schönbrunn (2,453,987 visitors) and Mariazell Basilica (1,500,000 visitors).

== Sports and nature ==

Of great touristic importance are the Austrian skiing, hiking and mountaineering resorts in the Alps as well as family-friendly recreation areas (e.g. the Witches&#x27;s Water in Tyrol). The same applies to the numerous Austrian lakes (e.g. Wolfgangsee and other lakes in the Salzkammergut east of Salzburg or Wörthersee in Carinthia) and castles. Stretching over Vorarlberg and Tyrol, Ski Arlberg is the largest connected ski area in Austria and one of five largest ski areas in the world. 

== Art and culture ==
For visitors interested in media art, there is the Ars Electronica Center in Linz. Since 1979 this center has organized the Ars Electronica Festival and presented the Prix Ars Electronica, the worldwide highest-ranked prize for media art.

== Internationally known annual events ==

==Arrivals by country==

Most visitors arriving to Austria on short term basis are from the following countries of nationality:
== Slogans of the provinces ==

*Burgenland – The sunny side of Austria
*Carinthia – The joy of living
*Lower Austria – Feel alive!
*Upper Austria – ?
*Salzburg – Stage of the World
*Styria – The Green Heart of Austria
*Tyrol – Heart of the Alps
*Vienna – Now. Forever.
*Vorarlberg – Poetry in Nature

<doc id="159127" wikidata="Q1267544" url="?curid=159127" title="Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)">
<text>Rated R (also known on vinyl as Rated X and Rated RX on the 2010 deluxe edition) is the second studio album by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age. It was released on June 6, 2000, by Interscope Records. &quot;Rated R&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album for the label, as well as their first to feature bassist Nick Oliveri and vocalist Mark Lanegan.

The album was a critical and commercial success and became the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, peaking at number 54 in the UK and eventually being certified gold by the BPI. Two singles were released from &quot;Rated R&quot;: &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret&quot; and &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot;, with the former helping the band reach mainstream popularity.

==Composition==

&quot;Rated R&quot; has been described as featuring stoner rock, alternative rock, hard rock, and alternative metal. The album contains numerous references to drugs and alcohol. This is particularly prominent on the opening track, &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot;, which consists entirely of the repeated verse &quot;Nicotine, valium, vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol&quot; followed by a chorus of &quot;c-c-c-c-c-cocaine&quot;. Though frontman Josh Homme has emphasized the fact there is no definitive endorsement or condemnation behind the lyrics, he has confirmed he came up with the lyrics stumbling through the desert at night after a New Year&#x27;s party, trying to remember what exactly he had consumed that evening leaving him so intoxicated.

Following the theme, &quot;Monsters in the Parasol&quot;, which originally appeared on the Desert Sessions album, &quot;Volume 4: Hard Walls and Little Trips&quot;, is about Homme&#x27;s first experience on LSD, kicking in just as his friends&#x27; father and sister came home, leading to a bad trip.
The song &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; offers an opposing stance on prescription drugs, while Homme&#x27;s favorite song from the album, closer &quot;I Think I Lost My Headache&quot;, is described as being about &quot;Paranoia... when you think something strange is going on, and everyone around you is so adamant about telling you it&#x27;s fine... but then you start thinking &#x27;Wouldn&#x27;t that be exactly what you&#x27;d say if you didn&#x27;t want me to know, and there is something going on?&#x27; And so it&#x27;s kind of about that paranoid mentality which maybe I have sometimes.&quot;
The song is also notable for its unconventional intro and outro in the 15/8 time signature, with the outro culminating in several minutes of an incessantly jarring and repetitive horn part, added to punish those who may have fallen asleep listening to the album.

&quot;Rated R&quot; features the debut of bassist Nick Oliveri and guest vocalist Mark Lanegan, who both made vocal and songwriting contributions to the band. In addition to providing backing vocals for &quot;Auto Pilot&quot; and &quot;I Think I Lost My Headache&quot;, Lanegan sang lead vocals on &quot;In the Fade&quot;, a song about clarity following a comedown/sobriety, while Oliveri sang &quot;Tension Head&quot;, a re-recording of the song &quot;13th Floor&quot; off Oliveri&#x27;s Mondo Generator&#x27;s debut album &quot;Cocaine Rodeo&quot;, and &quot;Quick and to the Pointless&quot;, which follows the singer&#x27;s experiences on heroin and speed, and cocaine and meth, respectively. &quot;Quick and to the Pointless&#x27;&quot; drum, bass, guitar and vocal tracks were recorded simultaneously in just one take. Oliveri&#x27;s vocal performance was originally intended to be a scratch vocal, but the band liked it so much that this original recording remained on the finished song including the two verses in Dutch.

One of the few songs not involving drug use is the albums&#x27; lead single, &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret&quot;, which is a response by Homme to people who had lost his trust, particularly involving trysts. Another one, the acoustic instrumental &quot;Lightning Song&quot; was penned by touring keyboardist, second guitarist, and lap steel player Dave Catching.

The 70s-era MPAA &quot;R&quot; rating bumper features on the album&#x27;s cover, along with the text &quot;RESTRICTED TO EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE, ALL THE TIME&quot;. The album&#x27;s liner notes contain further warning messages for each song, in the style of the warning messages given to parents on video and DVD boxes: &quot;Auto Pilot&quot;, for example, contains &quot;Alcohol and Sleep Deprivation&quot;. The title and subtext was meant by the band as a jab at record label Interscope for their insistence that the album&#x27;s themes were too controversial and would warrant a parental advisory sticker. The warnings in the album artwork circumvented the issue and the label allowed the band to sell the album without a sticker.

==Release==
&quot;Rated R&quot; was released by Interscope Records on June 6, 2000. A UK-only special edition of the album included a bonus disc, titled &quot;Rated U&quot;, which was also separately issued as the &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot; single. Along with &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot; and its video, it featured three newly recorded songs.

===2010 reissue===
In an interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Josh Homme announced plans to reissue &quot;Rated R&quot; which would feature B-side recordings and live performances from Reading Festival. It was released on August 3, 2010.

Added to the original album is a second disc with six B-sides and the band&#x27;s summer 2000 Reading Festival concert—featuring nine previously unreleased songs, including live versions of &quot;Rated R&quot;″s &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot;, &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret&quot;, &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; and &quot;Quick and to the Pointless&quot;.

The B-sides are &quot;Ode to Clarissa&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re So Vague&quot;, covers of Romeo Void&#x27;s &quot;Never Say Never&quot; and The Kinks&#x27; &quot;Who&#x27;ll Be the Next in Line&quot;, a live version of the album&#x27;s &quot;Monsters in the Parasol&quot;, a song originally from Josh Homme&#x27;s side project, The Desert Sessions, and a re-recording of &quot;Born to Hula&quot;, an early song from &quot;Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age&quot; EP. The other Reading Festival tracks are concert takes on &quot;Ode to Clarissa&quot;, three songs from the band&#x27;s debut album (&quot;Regular John&quot;, &quot;Avon&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Quit Me, Baby&quot;), and &quot;You Think I Ain&#x27;t Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire&quot;, another track originally by The Desert Sessions, which was also present on their third album, &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rated R&quot; was critically acclaimed. Steve Huey from AllMusic said &quot;&quot;R&quot; is mellower, trippier, and more arranged than its predecessor, making its point through warm fuzz-guitar tones, ethereal harmonies, vibraphones, horns, and even the odd steel drum. That might alienate listeners who have come to expect a crunchier guitar attack, but even though it&#x27;s not really aggro, R is still far heavier than the garage punk and grunge that inform much of the record. It&#x27;s still got the vaunted Arizona-desert vibes of Kyuss, but it evokes a more relaxed, spacious, twilight feel, as opposed to a high-noon meltdown. Mark Lanegan and Barrett Martin of the Screaming Trees both appear on multiple tracks, and their band&#x27;s psychedelic grunge – in its warmer, less noisy moments – is actually not a bad point of comparison.&quot;

&quot;Rhapsody&quot; called it the best rock album of the decade on its &quot;Rock&#x27;s Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the 82nd best album of the decade.

==Track listing==

=== Notes ===
*Most European editions separate &quot;In the Fade&quot; and the &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot; reprise into two tracks, 3:51 and 0:34 in length. The track listing on the back cover remains the same as on the regular edition, which means that it does not match the actual track numbers from that point on.
*In the liner notes, it states &quot;&#x27;Better Living Through Chemistry&#x27; chorus inspired by Björk&quot;; it borrows lyrics from the chorus on &quot;Crying&quot; on her &quot;Debut&quot; album.
*On the deluxe edition, the live version of the &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; track &quot;You Think I Ain&#x27;t Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire&quot; is shortened to simply &quot;Millionaire&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Rated R&quot; was the band&#x27;s breakout album in the UK. It peaked at number 54 there and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry in 2001 and later certified gold in 2013. In the U.S., however, the album did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, instead peaking at number 16 on the Top Heatseekers album chart.

&quot;Rated R&quot; included the hit single &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret&quot;, which was released in the summer of 2000 and became arguably the band&#x27;s most recognizable and popular song at its time of release. Not only did its music video receive mild airplay on music television, the song was featured in the &quot;Entourage&quot; episode &quot;I Love You Too&quot; (from Season 2). It was also the only single from the album to get a chart position, reaching number 21 on the Mainstream Rock chart, number 36 on the Modern Rock chart and number 31 on the UK Singles Chart.

<doc id="159129" wikidata="Q1192634" url="?curid=159129" title="Working directory">
<text>In computing, the working directory of a process is a directory of a hierarchical file system, if any, dynamically associated with the process. It is sometimes called the current working directory (CWD), e.g. the BSD getcwd function, or just current directory. When a process refers to a file using a path that does not begin with a / (forward slash), the path is interpreted as relative to the process&#x27;s working directory. So for example a process with working directory /rabbit-shoes that asks to create the file foo.txt will end up creating the file /rabbit-shoes/foo.txt.

==In operating systems==

In most computer file systems, every directory has an entry (usually named &quot;.&quot;) which points to the directory itself.

In most DOS and UNIX command shells, as well as in the Microsoft Windows command line interpreters cmd.exe and Windows PowerShell, the working directory can be changed by using the CD or CHDIR commands. In Unix shells, the pwd command outputs a full pathname of the working directory; the equivalent command in DOS and Windows is CD or CHDIR without arguments (whereas in Unix, cd used without arguments takes the user back to their home directory).

The environment variable PWD (in Unix/Linux shells), or the pseudo-environment variables CD (in Windows COMMAND.COM and cmd.exe, but not in OS/2 and DOS), or _CWD, _CWDS, _CWP and _CWPS (under 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT etc.) can be used in scripts, so that one need not start an external program. Microsoft Windows file shortcuts have the ability to store the working directory.

COMMAND.COM in DR-DOS 7.02 and higher provides ECHOS, a variant of the ECHO command omitting the terminating linefeed. This can be used to create a temporary batchjob storing the working directory in an environment variable like CD for later use, for example:
 ECHOS SET CD=&gt; SETCD.BAT
 CHDIR » SETCD.BAT
 CALL SETCD.BAT
 DEL SETCD.BAT
Alternatively, under Multiuser DOS and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, various internal and external commands support a parameter /B (for &quot;Batch&quot;). This modifies the output of commands to become suitable for direct command line input (when redirecting it into a batch file) or usage as a parameter for other commands (using it as input for another command). Where CHDIR would issue a directory path like codice_1, a command like CHDIR /B would issue codice_2 instead, so that CHDIR /B &gt; RETDIR.BAT would create a temporary batchjob allowing to return to this directory later on.

The working directory is also displayed by the $P token of the codice_3 command To keep the prompt short even inside of deep subdirectory structures, the DR-DOS 7.07 COMMAND.COM supports a $W token to display only the deepest subdirectory level. So, where a default PROMPT $P$G would result f.e. in codice_4 or codice_5, a PROMPT $N:$W$G would instead yield codice_6 and codice_7, respectively. A similar facility (using $W and $w) was added to 4DOS as well.

Under DOS, the absolute paths of the working directories of all logical volumes are internally stored in an array-like data structure called the Current Directory Structure (CDS), which gets dynamically allocated at boot time to hold the necessary number of slots for all logical drives (or as defined by LASTDRIVE). This structure imposes a length-limit of 66 characters on the full path of each working directory, and thus implicitly also limits the maximum possible depth of subdirectories. 
DOS Plus and older issues of DR DOS (up to DR DOS 6.0, with BDOS 6.7 in 1991) had no such limitation due to their implementation using a DOS emulation on top of a Concurrent DOS- (and thus CP/M-86-)derived kernel, which internally organized subdirectories as &quot;relative&quot; links to parent directories instead of as &quot;absolute&quot; paths. Since PalmDOS (with BDOS 7.0) and DR DOS 6.0 (1992 update with BDOS 7.1) and higher switched to use a CDS for maximum compatibility with DOS programs as well, they faced the same limitations as present in other DOSes.

==In programming languages==

Most programming languages provide an interface to the file system functions of the operating system, including the ability to set (change) the working directory of the program.

In the C language, the POSIX function codice_8 effects the system call which changes the working directory. Its argument is a text string with a path to the new directory, either absolute or relative to the old one. Where available, it can be called by a process to set its working directory.

There are similar functions in other languages. For example, in Visual Basic it is usually spelled codice_9.

In Java, the working directory can be obtained through the codice_10 interface, or through the codice_11 class. The working directory cannot be changed.

<text>The Islamic Supreme Council of America (ISCA) is a Muslim religious organization in the United States, founded in 1998 by Shaykh Hisham Kabbani, who was also its first chairman. The council describes itself as &quot;dedicated to educating Muslims and non-Muslims alike, and developing good citizenry through the teaching of moral excellence&quot;.

ISCA is based in Fenton, Michigan.
==Aims==

The ISCA sees its mission in part to &quot;work closely and proactively with non-Muslim individuals and organizations to present Islam as a religion of moderation, tolerance, peace and justice&quot;. It stresses &quot;the common heritage of Islam, Christianity and Judaism in an effort to foster mutual respect between all cultures and religions&quot;. It also seeks to &quot;integrate traditional scholarship in resolving contemporary issues affecting the maintenance of Islamic beliefs in a modern, secular society&quot;. The Council states that it promotes traditional Islamic legal rulings, and that it explicitly rejects puritanical forms of Islam, such as the Wahhabi Islam practiced by Saudi Arabia, the Taliban, and many terrorist organizations who espouse Islamist ideologies.

Shaykh Hisham Kabbani, founding member and current chairman of ISCA, is critical of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the American Muslim Council, saying, &quot;There are many Muslim organizations that claim to speak on behalf of the Muslim community but that in reality are not moderate, but extremist.&quot;

As of 23 September 2009, the ISCA website features photos of its officials meeting with George W. Bush, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, and UK Crown Prince Charles. The ISCA has been praised by Daniel Pipes, who describes it as &quot;relatively small&quot;.

<text>The Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) is a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group. It is headquartered on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., with regional offices nationwide. Through civil rights actions, media relations, civic engagement, and education, CAIR works to promote social, legal and political activism among Muslims in America.

== History ==
=== Early years (1994–2001) ===
CAIR was founded in June 1994. CAIR&#x27;s first office was located in Washington, D.C., as is its present-day headquarters on Capitol Hill. Its founding was partly in response to the film &quot;True Lies&quot;, which Arab and Muslim groups condemned for its stereotyping of Arab and Muslim villains. The offices opened a month before the film&#x27;s release. CAIR&#x27;s first advocacy campaign was in response to an offensive greeting card that used the term &quot;shia&quot; to refer to human excrement. CAIR led a national campaign and used activists to pressure the greeting card company, which eventually withdrew the card from the market.

In 1995, CAIR handled its first case of hijab discrimination, in which a Muslim employee was denied the right to wear the hijab; this type of complaint became one of the most common received by CAIR&#x27;s civil rights department.

CAIR continued its advocacy work in the aftermath of the April 19, 1995 Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building. Following the attack, Muslim-Americans were subjected to an upsurge in harassment and discrimination, including a rise in hate crimes nationally; 222 hate crimes against Muslims nationwide were reported in the days immediately following the bombing. The bombing gave CAIR national stature for their efforts to educate the public about Islam and religious bias in America; their report was featured on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on August 28, 1995, and was subsequently mentioned on &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;.

In 1996, CAIR began &quot;CAIR-NET&quot;, a read-only e-mail listserve aimed to help American Muslims identify and combat anti-Muslim prejudice in the U.S. and Canada. CAIR-NET contained descriptions of news, bias incidents or hate speech and hate crimes, often followed by information as to whom readers may contact to influence resolution of an issue. CAIR also held its first voter registration drive in 1996; CAIR continues to encourage active political participation by American Muslims, for them to address political candidates and elected representatives with greater frequency.

In 1996, CAIR published a report &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; regarding its perception of anti-Muslim rhetoric in the media after the crash of TWA Flight 800. Their research showed 138 uses of the terms &quot;Muslim&quot; and &quot;Arab&quot; in the 48 hours after the crash in Reuters, UPI, and AP articles covering the incident. The official NTSB report said that the crash was most likely caused by mechanical failure.

In 1997, CAIR objected to the production of sneakers made by Nike with a design on the heel similar to the Arabic word for &quot;Allah&quot;. As part of an agreement reached between CAIR officials and Nike representatives, Nike apologized to the Muslim community, recalled the products carrying the design, launched an investigation as to how the logo came about, and built a number of children&#x27;s playgrounds near some Islamic centers in America.

In 1997, as depictions of Muhammad are seen as blasphemous by some Muslims, CAIR wrote to United States Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist requesting that the sculpted representation of Muhammad on the north frieze inside the Supreme Court building be removed or sanded down. About the request, CAIR spokesman Nihad Awad said, &quot;We believe the court had good intention by honoring the prophet, so we appreciate that. We want to be flexible, and we&#x27;re willing to pay for the changes ourselves.&quot; The court rejected CAIR&#x27;s request in the end.

=== Post-9/11 (2001–present) ===
CAIR strongly condemned the 9/11 terrorist attacks and has a long history of condemning and combating extremism. In October 2001, CAIR opposed the United States invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks. By January 2002, four months after the attacks, the CAIR said that it had received 1,658 reports of discrimination, profiling, harassment, and physical assaults against persons appearing Arab or Muslim, a threefold increase over the prior year. The reports included beatings, death threats, abusive police practices, and employment and airline-related discrimination.&quot;

A CAIR initiative funded in part by a $500,000 donation from Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud sent a set of 18 books and tapes to public libraries written by Muslim and non-Muslim authors on Islamic history and practices, as well as an English translation of the Quran.

In 2005, CAIR coordinated the joint release of a fatwa by 344 American Muslim organizations, mosques, and imams nationwide that stated: &quot;Islam strictly condemns religious extremism and the use of violence against innocent lives. There is no justification in Islam for extremism or terrorism. Targeting civilians&#x27; life and property through suicide bombings or any other method of attack is &quot;haram&quot; or forbidden—and those who commit these barbaric acts are criminals, not martyrs.&quot; The fatwa cited passages from the Quran and hadith that prohibit violence against innocent people and injustice, and was signed by the Fiqh Council of North America. Authors Kim Ezra Shienbaum and Jamal Hasan felt it did not go far enough in that it did not address attacks on military targets.

Also in 2005, following the Qur&#x27;an desecration controversy of 2005 at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, CAIR initiated an &quot;Explore the Quran&quot; campaign, aimed at providing free copies of the Quran to any person who requested it.

In 2006, during the protests over cartoons depicting Muhammad, CAIR responded by launching an educational program &quot;Explore the Life of Muhammad&quot;, to bring &quot;people of all faiths together to learn more about the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and to use mutual understanding as a counterweight to the tensions created by the cartoon controversy&quot;. It provided free copies of a DVD or book about the life of Muhammad to any person who requested it. Almost 16,000 Americans requested materials.

In June 2006, CAIR announced a $50 million project to create a better understanding of Islam and Muslims in the US. ($10 million per year for five years), in a project to be spearheaded by Paul Findley, a former US Congressman.

Also in 2006, CAIR sent a group of representatives to Iraq to urge kidnappers to release American journalist Jill Carroll. Carroll was eventually released unharmed.

in December 2006, California Senator Barbara Boxer withdrew a &quot;certificate of accomplishment&quot; originally given to former CAIR official Basim Elkarra after Boxer&#x27;s staff looked into CAIR, and she became concerned about some of CAIR&#x27;s past statements and actions, and statements by some law enforcement officials that it provides aid to international terrorist groups.

In May 2007, the U.S. filed an action against the Holy Land Foundation (the largest Muslim charity in the United States at the time) for providing funds to Hamas, and federal prosecutors filed pleadings. Along with 245 other organizations, they listed CAIR (and its chairman emeritus, Omar Ahmad), Islamic Society of North America (largest Muslim umbrella organization in the United States), Muslim American Society and North American Islamic Trust as unindicted co-conspirators, a legal designation that can be employed for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity, pragmatic considerations, and evidentiary concerns. While being listed as co-conspirator does not mean that CAIR has been charged with anything, the organization was concerned that the label will forever taint it.

In 2007, the organization was named, along with 245 others, by U.S. Federal prosecutors in a list of unindicted co-conspirators or joint venturers in a Hamas funding case involving the Holy Land Foundation, which in 2009, caused the FBI to cease working with CAIR outside of criminal investigations due to its designation. CAIR was never charged with any crime, and it complained that the designation had tarnished its reputation. It has also been criticized for allegedly publishing propaganda

On October 22, 2007, the Holy Land Foundation trial ended in a mistrial. All defendants were convicted upon retrial in 2008.

In 2008, the FBI discontinued its long-standing relationship with CAIR. Officials said the decision followed the conviction of the HLF directors for funneling millions of dollars to Hamas, revelations that Nihal Awad had participated in planning meetings with HLF, and CAIR&#x27;s failure to provide details of its ties to Hamas. During a 2008 retrial of the HLF case, FBI Special Agent Lara Burns labeled CAIR &quot;a front group for Hamas&quot;. In January 2009, the FBI&#x27;s DC office instructed all field offices to cut ties with CAIR, as the ban extended into the Obama administration.

U.S. Congressmen Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), John Shadegg (R-Ariz.), and Paul Broun (R-Ga.) wrote Attorney General Eric Holder on October 21, 2009, that they were concerned about CAIR&#x27;s relationships with terrorist groups, and requesting that the Department of Justice (DOJ) provide a summary of DOJ&#x27;s evidence and findings that led DOJ to name CAIR an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation terrorism trial. The four Congressmen also wrote House of Representatives Sergeant at Arms Wilson Livingood a letter the same day asking that he work with members of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Intelligence Committees to determine if CAIR was successful in placing interns in the committees&#x27; offices, to review FBI and DOJ evidence regarding CAIR&#x27;s Hamas ties, and to determine whether CAIR is a security threat. Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.), &quot;appalled&quot;, said &quot;I urge the rest of my colleagues to join me in denouncing this witch hunt.&quot; She was echoed by Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the first Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress, in a speech that included a statement by the House&#x27;s Tri-Caucus. The four Republican Congressmen, joined by Senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), then wrote IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman on November 16, 2009, asking that CAIR be investigated for &quot;excessive lobbying&quot;. CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper welcomed the scrutiny from Republican lawmakers, and said, &quot;We&#x27;ve always stayed within our legal limits [for lobbying]. If anything, we don&#x27;t have enough staff to lobby as much as we legally can.&quot;

CAIR condemned the Fort Hood shooting and expressed prayers for the victims and condolences for their families.

CAIR pointed to an arrest of five men in Pakistan on December 10, 2009, as a &quot;success story&quot; between Muslims and Muslim community organizations (like CAIR) and American law enforcement authorities. When the five men left Washington for Karachi on November 28, the families of the men discovered an extremist videotape. Worried, they contacted CAIR, which set up a meeting with the FBI on December 1, and the families shared their sons&#x27; computers and electronic devices with FBI agents. A U.S. law enforcement official described them as models of cooperation. CAIR hoped the event would ease &quot;strained&quot; relations of American Muslims with the FBI.

In January 2012, CAIR&#x27;s Michigan chapter took a stance along with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in defending four Muslim high school football players accused of attacking a quarterback during a game. The players were allegedly targeted for criminal prosecution over the attack because of their ethnic origin. A judge later dropped the charges after deciding they had no merit.

CAIR has opposed proposed United States legislation and executive orders which would have designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization, saying that such a designation would &quot;inevitably be used in a political campaign to attack those same groups and individuals, to marginalize the American Muslim community and to demonize Islam&quot;.

In 2021 the director of the San Francisco branch of CAIR, Zahra Billoo, gave a speech in which she denounced a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and stated that &quot;We need to pay attention&quot; to the ADL and Hillel, &quot;because just because they are your friends today, doesn&#x27;t mean that they have your back when it comes to human rights.&quot; Later on in her speech, Billoo told the audience to &quot;know your enemies&quot;. Her remarks prompted Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL, to accuse Billoo of promoting white supremacist rhetoric. On December 11, CAIR responded by defending Billoo&#x27;s remarks.

== Projects and media ==
Local CAIR chapters such as the Michigan chapter organized a &quot;Remember Through Service&quot; campaign which was a video and billboard media campaign which featured positive representations of Muslim-Americans including a Muslim first responder during the September 11 World Trade Center events.

== Litigation ==
=== Workplace discrimination ===
One of the largest categories of cases CAIR deals with is workplace discrimination. CAIR has filed successful civil rights litigation on behalf of Muslim Americans who suffered employment discrimination due to their religion, including police officers and hospital workers. CAIR also filed an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiff to the Supreme Court of the United States for &quot;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores&quot;, in which the Court ruled 8-1 that refusing to hire a woman because she may wear her hijab at the workplace amounts to religious discrimination in hiring.

=== Local government ===
In 2012, after the City Council in St. Anthony, Minnesota, voted 4–1 to reject a building plan for the Abu-Huraira Islamic Center, CAIR began legal proceedings and urged the federal government to investigate the city for violating the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. In 2014, the city agreed to a settlement after a federal lawsuit was opened against them, allowing the Abu-Huraira Islamic Center to begin services. CAIR also helped the American Islamic Center (AIC) file a complaint against the city of Des Plaines, Illinois, to the US Department of Justice, after the city refused to allow the AIC to operate its place of worship. After a federal suit was filed, the city agreed to pay $580,000 to the AIC in a settlement agreement.

In 2012, CAIR successfully filed suit striking down State Question 755, a ban on Sharia law in Oklahoma on grounds that it violated the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion

In 2017, CAIR secured an $85,000 settlement for Kirsty Powell, whose hijab was forcibly removed by police while in custody.

=== Federal government ===
CAIR has been involved in legal action against the US Government on several occasions. In 2003, CAIR along with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee filed suit in &quot;Muslim Community Association of Ann Arbor v. Ashcroft&quot;, which challenged the constitutionality of the USA PATRIOT Act. The case forced Congress to make substantial changes to Section 215 of the act, which helped it avoid being in violation of the First Amendment and had the effect of resolving the lawsuit. CAIR also filed amicus briefs against US President Donald Trump over Executive Order 13769 and Executive Order 13780, which banned all travellers and temporary visa holders of 7 Muslim-majority countries, as well as all refugees, from entering the United States. Barack Obama had previously, during his presidency, imposed travel restrictions on the same Muslim-majority countries due to national security concerns and the potential for terrorism. CAIR began maintaining a group of immigration lawyers in Chicago O&#x27;Hare airport after Executive Order 13769 went into effect and caused the immediate revocation of over 100,000 temporary visas.

CAIR litigated on behalf of Gulet Mohamed, a 19-year-old Virginia teenager who was kidnapped and tortured in Kuwait after the FBI placed him on a no-fly list. CAIR argued successfully that the teen&#x27;s placement on the US no-fly list was &quot;patently unconstitutional&quot; and that Mohamed had a constitutional right to come home.

=== &quot;Muslim Mafia&quot; lawsuit ===

The 2009 book &quot;Muslim Mafia: Inside the Secret Underworld That&#x27;s Conspiring to Islamize America&quot; by Paul David Gaubatz and Paul Sperry portrays CAIR &quot;as a subversive organization allied with international terrorists&quot;.

Consequently, CAIR brought a federal civil lawsuit in 2009 against Dave Gaubatz and his son for allegedly stealing documents, which were used in the making of Gaubatz&#x27;s book. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly concluded that the Gaubatzs &quot;unlawfully obtained access to, and have already caused repeated public disclosure of, material containing CAIR&#x27;s proprietary, confidential and privileged information,&quot; which CAIR says included names, addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of CAIR employees and donors. As a result, the judge ordered Gaubatz to remove certain documents from his website. Judge Kollar-Kotelly also said that CAIR&#x27;s employees have reported a dramatic increase in the number of threatening communications since the release of Gaubatz&#x27;s book.

== Operations ==
CAIR&#x27;s literature describes the group as promoting understanding of Islam and protecting Muslim civil liberties. It has intervened on behalf of many American Muslims who claim discrimination, profiling, or harassment.

== Controversies ==

=== Gender bias ===
A Florida CAIR chapter has been accused of ignoring misconduct involving its leaders. NPR reported: &quot;When concerned parties brought [gender bias] allegations to senior CAIR officials in Washington, D.C., and Florida, former employees said, there was little, if any, follow-up action. They said leaders were aware of some of the allegations as early as 2016.&quot; NPR &quot;interviewed 18 former employees at the national office and several prominent chapters who said there was a general lack of accountability when it came to perceived gender bias, religious bias or mismanagement&quot;.

=== Labor organizing ===
NPR&#x27;s investigation reported that CAIR &quot;thwart[ed] employees&#x27; efforts to unionize in the national office in 2016&quot;. &quot;Service Employees International Union Local 500 said in filings Wednesday that the Council on American-Islamic Relations was trying to bust its effort to organize the civil rights group&#x27;s staff. CAIR responded with a statement Thursday calling the charge &#x27;meritless&#x27;.&quot;

=== Designation as terrorist organization by UAE===
In November 2014, CAIR was designated a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates, which claimed that the organization has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash rejected criticism of the designation, saying that &quot;The noise (by) some Western organizations over the UAE&#x27;s terrorism list originates in groups that are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and many of them work on incitement and creating an environment of extremism.&quot;
CAIR called the move &quot;shocking and bizarre&quot;, and some international American terrorism analysts were also critical. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;CAIR and the Muslim American Society are not alone in their shock. Diverse groups across Europe were also added to the list, leaving many observers perplexed at the scope and sheer scale of the list. Norway&#x27;s foreign ministry publicly requested an explanation as to why one of the country&#x27;s largest Islamic groups, the Islamic Organization, was included, and the U.S. State Department said they would be seeking more information from the U.A.E.&quot; In January 2015, CAIR said it would seek to appeal the designation in the UAE. CAIR has criticized UAE for targeting and detaining American Muslims, such as the civil rights attorney and human rights activist Asim Ghafoor, the former attorney of the Jamal Khashoggi&quot;,&quot; the &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist assassination by agents of the Saudi government in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Ghafoor helped establish the organization Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), which has focused part of its work on human rights violations in the UAE. CAIR has claimed that &quot;The real reason the UAE targeted Ghafoor became even clearer when Emirati media outlets began publishing unhinged, Islamophobic hit-pieces slandering him as a “terrorist” for his pro-democracy work with DAWN and other groups.&quot; It also argued that, &quot;the UAE’s history targeting American Muslims as part of its effort to spread secular authoritarianism throughout the Middle East.&quot;

In an interview with Bret Baier of Fox News, UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan was asked about the designation of CAIR as a terrorist group, in which he responded:

The United States government has not listed CAIR as a terrorist organization.

===LGBT rights===
In 2016, in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting, CAIR representatives met with LGBT leaders to condemn the attack, gather in solidarity, and voice their support for LGBT rights. CAIR Sacramento director Basim Elkarra also released a statement offering “support and allyship to the LGBTQ community, which has been a faithful ally against Islamophobia.” CAIR director Nihad Awad also voiced his support, saying that American “Muslims stand united” with the LGBT community.

In Michigan, CAIR voiced concerns over an amendment to the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, advocating that the amendment&#x27;s LGBT rights provisions include faith protections.

CAIR and several other Muslim organizations have opposed mandatory “sexually-themed lessons” in Montgomery County, Maryland. These lessons include LGBT-inclusive content. CAIR issued a statement saying parents should be notified in advance so their children can opt-out of “sexually-themed content.” CAIR released a statement saying that “Schools should respect their authority by restoring the option to opt their children out of reading sexually-themed content or participating in sexually-themed lessons and discussions, without any adverse consequences.&quot;”&quot;

== Reception ==

=== Praise ===
U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer&#x27;s 2006 decision to withdraw a &quot;certificate of accomplishment&quot; originally given to former CAIR official Basim Elkarra on grounds of suspicions about the organization&#x27;s background &quot;provoked an outcry from organizations that vouch for the group&#x27;s advocacy, including the ACLU and the California Council of Churches.&quot; Maya Harris, executive director of the ACLU of Northern California, criticized Senator Boxer&#x27;s decision and added that CAIR has &quot;been a leading organization that has advocated for civil rights and civil liberties in the face of fear and intolerance, in the face of religious and ethnic profiling.&quot;

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nicholas Kristof advocated for people to support and sign up as members of CAIR in response to the 2016 election of US President Donald Trump.

In 2016, the University of Saint Thomas named the Minnesota branch of CAIR as the winner of its Winds of Change Award at its Forum on Workplace Inclusion.

The Seattle chapter of the League of Women Voters awarded the Washington branch of CAIR one of its 2015 Champion of Voting and Civil Rights Awards, praising &quot;their work encouraging voting and community involvement by members of the Muslim American community&quot;.

=== Criticism ===
December 2023, the Biden administration cut off contact with CAIR after its executive director stated he was &quot;happy to see&quot; Palestinians break Israel&#x27;s siege on the Gaza Strip on October 7. Awad also stated that Palestinians &quot;have the right to self-defense&quot; but that Israel &quot;as an occupying power&quot; does not. According to a CAIR press release, during his speech, Awad had also stated that, &quot;The hatred, the prejudice, the violence, the discrimination against Jews because of their faith or their life or their religious practices is a hateful mindset, behavior and action. We as human beings, as Muslims, as Palestinians, see it as evil the way it is, and [it] should be condemned because antisemitism is a real phenomenon, a real evil, and it has to be rejected and combated by all people regardless of their faith tradition, ideology, or those people who have no ideology. It is an attack on humanity and should be clearly condemned by all people.&quot;

In response to the criticism from the Biden administration, Awad released a statement and held a press conference in which he reiterated his opposition to and condemnation of all attacks on civilians, including the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel, claiming that this original remarks were taken out of context. He stated that, “Ukrainians, Palestinians and other occupied people have the right to defend themselves and escape occupation by just and legal means, but targeting civilians is never an acceptable means of doing so, which is why I have again and again condemned the violence against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7th and past Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians, including suicide bombings, all the way back to the 1990s—just as I have condemned the decades of violence against Palestinian civilians. “The average Palestinians who briefly walked out of Gaza and set foot on their ethnically cleansed land in a symbolic act of defiance against the blockade and stopped there without engaging in violence were within their rights under international law; the extremists who went on to attack civilians in southern Israel were not. Targeting civilians is unacceptable, no matter whether they are Israeli or Palestinian or any other nationality.”

Critics of CAIR have accused it of pursuing an Islamist agenda. CAIR denies these allegations. Zuhdi Jasser, a physician and Republican politician in Arizona, has criticized CAIR and argued that its agenda is focused on &quot;victimization&quot;. Best-selling author and prominent critic of Islam, Sam Harris, criticized CAIR by saying the organization is &quot;an Islamist public relations firm posing as a civil-rights lobby&quot;.

Some Muslims have criticized CAIR for taking a conservative religious approach on some issues. These critics claim that past statements by the organization, such as the claim that the headscarf is a religious requirement for Muslim women, often follow conservative Saudi religious doctrine and do not capture diverse religious perspectives. The claim that the headscarf is religious obligation upon Muslim women has been criticized by some Muslim scholars and academics, including Khaled Abou El Fadl.

== Funding ==
CAIR has an annual budget of around $3 million (as of 2007). It states that while the majority of its funding comes from American Muslims, it accepts donations from individuals of any faith and also foreigners. In the past CAIR has accepted donations from individuals and foundations close to Arab governments. Within CAIR there is debate regarding foreign funding, and several CAIR branches have criticized the national office for accepting foreign donations.

In April 2011, Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va. cited a 2009 letter sent from CAIR&#x27;s executive director, Nihad Awad, to Muammar Gaddafi asking Gaddafi for funding for a project called the Muslim Peace Foundation at a U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations sub-committee hearing. Steven Emerson called the funding request &quot;hypocritical&quot;, while CAIR spokesman, Ibrahim Hooper, said that the Muslim Peace Foundation was Awad&#x27;s personal initiative &quot;unrelated to CAIR&quot;, that CAIR didn&#x27;t receive any money from the Libyan government, and also that CAIR was one of the first American organizations to call for a no-fly zone to protect Libyan citizens from Gaddafi during the 2011 Libyan Civil War.

It ran from 4 April 1975 to 10 June 1978 on BBC1 and was written by Bob Larbey and John Esmonde. Opening with the midlife crisis of Tom Good, a 40-year-old plastics designer, it relates the joys and setbacks he and his wife Barbara experience when they attempt to escape a modern &quot;rat race&quot; lifestyle by &quot;becoming totally self-sufficient&quot; in their suburban house in Surbiton. In 2004, it came ninth in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;. The lead roles are taken by Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal.

==Background==
John Esmonde and Bob Larbey wrote &quot;The Good Life&quot; for Richard Briers, the only cast member who was well known before the series was broadcast. Larbey and Esmonde were inspired by Larbey&#x27;s 40th birthday, which seemed to them a milestone in most people&#x27;s lives. Their story has the Goods&#x27; decision to pursue self-sufficiency conflicting sharply with the habits of the Leadbetters, who live next door. The conflict between the neighbours, balanced with an increasingly close friendship, creates comic tension as that friendship is tried to its limits.

Peter Bowles was originally cast to play Jerry but was unavailable. (He later starred opposite Penelope Keith in &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;.) Hannah Gordon was considered for the role of Barbara but was ruled out, having recently played a similar role in the BBC sitcom &quot;My Wife Next Door&quot;. Esmonde and Larbey chose Felicity Kendal and Penelope Keith after seeing them on stage together in &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot;.

Outdoor filming took place in the north London suburb of Northwood, although the story was set in Surbiton, another suburb in south-west London. The producers searched extensively for a suitable pair of houses, eventually chancing on Kewferry Road, Northwood. The grounds of the Goods&#x27; house were returned to their original state after the filming of each series&#x27; inserts, and all livestock removed at the end of each day&#x27;s filming. Interior scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre in front of a live audience.

The opening theme was composed by Burt Rhodes (1923–2003).

==Plot==
On his 40th birthday, Tom Good is no longer able to take his job seriously and gives up work as a draughtsman for a company that makes plastic toys for breakfast cereal packets. With their house in The Avenue, Surbiton, paid for, he and his wife Barbara adopt a sustainable, simple and nearly self-sufficient lifestyle while staying in their house. They turn their front and back gardens into allotments, growing soft fruit and vegetables. They introduce chickens, pigs (Pinky and Perky), a goat (Geraldine) and a cockerel (Lenin). They generate their own electricity with methane from animal waste, and attempt to make their own clothes. They sell or barter surplus crops for essentials they cannot make themselves. They cut their monetary requirements to the minimum, with varying success.

Their actions horrify their kindly but conventional neighbours, Margo and Jerry Leadbetter. Margo and Jerry were intended to be minor characters, but their relationship with one another and the Goods became an essential element of the series. Under the influence of the Goods&#x27; homemade wine, called &quot;peapod burgundy&quot; (the strength of which becomes a running joke), their intermingled attractions to one another become apparent.

==Characters==
===Tom Good===
Tom&#x27;s career has been as a draughtsman at JJM, a job he thoroughly dislikes. He feels his life is meaningless, nothing more than work and consumption. Becoming self-sufficient is his idea, but Barbara, after expressing concerns, supports him. Tom is determined to succeed at self-sufficiency, and is mostly cheerful about his new lifestyle. Despite being an eternal optimist most of the time, Tom can also be obstinate and pigheaded, often to Barbara&#x27;s detriment or irritation. On the few occasions that he is pessimistic, Barbara becomes the optimist.

===Barbara Good===
Barbara is a normal, middle-class housewife when the series begins. While she sometimes wilts under Tom&#x27;s determined and dominant nature, her sharp tongue puts her on an equal footing. She is the heart of the enterprise, while Tom&#x27;s engineering brain designs and builds what they need. She occasionally misses the luxuries but her own determination to succeed, with Tom&#x27;s single-minded persuasion, keeps her going.

===Jerry Leadbetter===
Jerry works for JJM, having joined the same day as Tom, although the two men knew each other for at least two years before they went to work for the same company. By his own account, Jerry has risen to senior management through cunning and self-promotion rather than ability – he tells Tom directly that he has only 10% of Tom&#x27;s talent. As the series progresses, he moves within striking distance of the managing director&#x27;s job. Jerry is convinced that the Goods&#x27; go-it-alone attempt will fail and on several occasions pleads with Tom to come back. But he grows to appreciate the character it has taken for Tom to leave the system. He is henpecked at home but has the strength to make his case.

===Margo Leadbetter===
Margo cannot understand her neighbours&#x27; lifestyle, but their friendship is important to her. As a child, she was bullied at school for having no sense of humour. A social climber, staunchly Conservative and unafraid to challenge anyone who gets on her nerves, Margo nevertheless reveals a heart of gold. She involves herself with organisations such as the pony club and the music society, always wishing to play the lead role, although frequently the Goods&#x27; activities frustrate her attempts to impress her social circle. Margo is occasionally made aware of her faults by others, including her husband, and is not too proud to apologise.

===Andrew and Felicity===
Andrew, &quot;Andy&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot;, is managing director of JJM. He feigns ignorance of Tom&#x27;s existence (&quot;Mr Ummm of the Fourth Floor&quot;), but once Tom leaves, Andy becomes desperate to bring him back. His wife, Felicity, is more relaxed. She is one of the few characters to support the Goods and finds their attempt at self-sufficiency exciting. She says, &quot;I wanted to do something exciting when I was young, and then I met Andrew and that was the end of that.&quot; They have one son, unseen, called Martin. Andrew calls Tom and Barbara &quot;Tim and Fatima&quot;, but in the episode &quot;Anniversary&quot; admits he has always known their names and pretends to forget – &quot;an old executive ploy to put people at a disadvantage.&quot; Felicity doesn&#x27;t appear series 1 with one more reference to her by Jerry and Margo in the episode &quot;Mutiny&quot;.

===Mrs Weaver===
Mrs Weaver buys the house next door to Tom and Barbara in series 2, much to the relief of Margo, who approves of Mrs Weaver&#x27;s conservative values as opposed to the two students lodging with the Goods who had initially threatened to purchase the house. Initially, the Goods and Mrs Weaver have an embarrassing introduction to each other, but when Mrs Weaver is impressed by the pottery skills of Tom, they become friendly. Mrs Weaver&#x27;s enthusiasm for Tom&#x27;s pottery encourages him to take up making ceramics, but he baulks at the idea of doing it professionally. Mrs Weaver continues to be mentioned, but is not seen again. In series 4 it is revealed she has moved away, leaving the house empty, but with a half-full tank of heating oil in the garden. The Goods telephone her and she agrees to them taking the oil, but they discover the leaking tank has destroyed their garden.

===Unseen characters===
Several characters are mentioned but unseen. Margo is at odds with Miss Dolly Mountshaft, dictatorial leading light of the music society. The overweight Mrs Dooms-Paterson is an equally dictatorial acquaintance and a fellow member of the pony club. Mr and Mrs Pearson, the Leadbetters&#x27; gardener and housekeeper, are mentioned in several episodes. Mr Weaver, the husband of Mrs Weaver, is mentioned but not met in episode 6 of season 2, when Margo speaks of Mr and Mrs Weaver.

==Episodes==
&quot;The Good Life&quot; aired for four series and two specials from 4 April 1975 to 10 June 1978. The final one-off episode, &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Five&quot;, was a Royal Command Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and senior BBC management. The cast and crew were presented to the Queen and Prince Philip after the recording. The episode was originally broadcast in a 45-minute slot with footage either side of the 30-minute episode showing the royal party entering and exiting. The performance came about after the BBC invited the Queen to attend a recording of a television programme for the first time to mark her Silver Jubilee and to this end, the royal household was asked to confirm her favourite entertainment show. Reputedly, this was &quot;The Good Life&quot;, but this was problematic as the series had ended before it was possible to facilitate the Queen&#x27;s attendance. Thus a &#x27;Christmas Special&#x27; episode was commissioned, but it proved impossible for the Queen&#x27;s schedule to accommodate the recording and a further subsequent episode was commissioned, although this was not recorded until 1978, after the jubilee year. Despite being informed that &quot;The Good Life&quot; was the Queen&#x27;s favourite, when Felicity Kendal&#x27;s son presented her with a bouquet upon her arrival at Television Centre, the Queen asked &quot;who is Felicity Kendal?&quot;

==Novelisations==
Two novelisations of &quot;The Good Life&quot; were written by Esmonde and Larbey. The first, &quot;The Good Life&quot;, was published in 1976 by Penguin Books, and novelised the first series. The second, &quot;More of The Good Life&quot;, was published in 1977, also by Penguin, and featured three episodes from series two and four episodes from series three.

==Other countries==
The series broadcast in Australia on ABC and in Canada on CBC. It was also seen in South Africa, Zimbabwe, New Zealand and many other Commonwealth countries as well as Belgium and the Netherlands.

In the United States &quot;The Good Life&quot; was retitled &quot;Good Neighbors&quot; to avoid confusion with a short-lived American sitcom of the same name, and was shown by most PBS stations across the country starting in the early 1980s. By the late 1980s, it was rarely seen but returned to PBS stations after CBS/Fox Video released selected episodes on VHS in 1998.

==After &quot;The Good Life&quot;==
After the success of &quot;The Good Life&quot;, the four main cast members were given their own vehicles, commissioned by the then head of comedy and producer of &quot;The Good Life&quot;, John Howard Davies. Immediately after the series ended, Larbey and Esmonde created &quot;The Other One&quot; for Richard Briers, co-starring Michael Gambon. It was a seven-part sitcom that aired on BBC1 in the autumn of 1977, running concurrently with &quot;The Good Life Christmas Special – Silly, but it&#x27;s fun&quot;. A second series of six episodes aired in early 1979. Keith starred alongside Peter Bowles in &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;, which began in September 1979. Eddington joined Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds in &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and its sequel &quot;Yes Prime Minister&quot;. Kendal, who had become something of a sex symbol, went on to join Elspet Gray in &quot;Solo&quot; and Jane Asher in &quot;The Mistress&quot;. Briers later starred alongside Penelope Wilton and Peter Egan in the sitcom &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot;, again written by Larbey and Esmonde, in which Briers&#x27; character was the polar opposite of Tom Good. In 1992, Kendal and Eddington reunited in the Channel Four adaptation of Mary Wesley&#x27;s &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot;.

In 2003, the BBC broadcast the mockumentary &quot;Life Beyond the Box: Margo Leadbetter&quot;, describing Margo&#x27;s life since the series had finished, although the original actors appear only in archive footage. In 2007, Briers and Kendal were reunited on ITV1 series &quot;That&#x27;s What I Call Television&quot; in a mockup of the Goods&#x27; kitchen.

===In popular culture===
&quot;The Good Life&quot; features in an episode of &quot;The Young Ones&quot; titled &quot;Sick&quot; where Vyvyan (played by Adrian Edmondson) rips apart the title page after the first 10 seconds of the opening credits of this show while criticising it, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s so bloody nice! Felicity &#x27;Treacle&#x27; Kendal and Richard &#x27;Sugar-Flavoured Snot&#x27; Briers! What do they do now?! Chocolate bloody button ads, that&#x27;s what! They&#x27;re nothing but a couple of reactionary stereotypes, confirming the myth that everyone in Britain is a lovable middle-class eccentric. And I hate them!&quot;

Giles Coren and Sue Perkins worked together on a four-episode series &quot;Giles and Sue Live the Good Life&quot;, broadcast to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the original series. In the series, they recreated an attempt by two city-dwellers to adjust to country life, in ways such as raising their own barnyard animals, creating their own Christmas decorations and knitting their own clothing.

In late 2020, a podcast celebrating sitcoms of the 1970s – &quot;The Sitcom Archive Deep Dive Overdrive&quot; — was launched. The weekly show examines and celebrates every episode ever made of &quot;The Good Life&quot; made throughout its first series.

Some have connected the increasing popularity of hobby farms to the success of TV shows like &quot;The Good Life&quot;.

==Home media==
The complete series of &quot;The Good Life&quot; was made available in the US (Region 1) under the title &quot;Good Neighbors&quot;. Series 1–3 were released as a box set in 2005; Series 4 was released in 2006 and includes the Royal Command Performance.

The first UK (Region 2) DVD release omits two episodes (the first episode from series 1 and one from series 3). All four complete series were rereleased in their entirety on 29 March, 24 May, 19 July and 20 September 2010; the complete boxset has also been rereleased.

All four series have been released in their entirety in Australia (Region 4), albeit in NTSC format rather than the PAL format typical in Australia. The series 4 release (on two DVDs) also contains an interview with Briers as well as the Royal Command Performance episode.
==Stage adaptation==
A stage adaptation of the sitcom premiered at the Theatre Royal, Bath, before embarking on a UK tour in October 2021. It was written and directed by Jeremy Sams and starred Rufus Hound as Tom Good.

<doc id="159142" wikidata="Q315360" url="?curid=159142" title="Damascius">
<text>Damascius (; , 462 – after 538), known as &quot;the last of the Athenian Neoplatonists&quot;, was the last scholarch of the neoplatonic Athenian school. He was one of the neoplatonic philosophers who left Athens after laws confirmed by emperor Justinian I forced the closure of the Athenian school in c. 529 AD. After he left Athens, he may have sought refuge in the court of the Persian King Chrosroes, before being allowed back into the Byzantine Empire. His surviving works consist of three commentaries on the works of Plato, and a metaphysical text entitled &quot;Difficulties and Solutions of First Principles&quot;.

==Life==
Much of what is known about Damascius&#x27; life comes from his semi-autobiographical work called &quot;The Philosophical History&quot;, or &quot;Life of Isidore&quot;, and from a work called &quot;Vita Severi&quot; written by the 6th-century bishop and historian Zacharias Scholasticus. Damascius, as his name suggests, was born in Damascus in c. 462 AD, and travelled to Alexandria in the 480s AD to study rhetoric at the coeducational school of the late 5th-century Alexandrian professor Horapollo, where students of different religions and philosophies studied together. Zacharias reports that there was a close relationship between the neoplatonic communities of Athens and Alexandria, as Agapius of Athens and Severianus of Damascus, students of Proclus&#x27; neoplatonic school in Athens, also studied in neoplatonic schools in Alexandria. Damascius may have travelled to Athens shortly before Proclus died in 485 AD, to teach rhetoric, and travelled back to Alexandria before 488 AD.

Late 5th-century Alexandria was a tumultuous place; there were conflicting factions of pro-Chalcedonian and Monophysite Christians, and a growing hostile sentiment towards neoplatonists and people of other non-Christian religions and philosophies that sometimes led to rioting and arrests of leaders of non-Christian schools, resulting in students having to flee and go into hiding. Damascius&#x27; accounts of these times paints a picture of a circle of intellectuals that was under siege, arrested, interrogated and who were sometimes courageous, but at other times capitulated. Horapollo, the head of the school at which Damascius had studied and taught rhetoric for nine years, was arrested in 489 AD, causing Damascius and the neoplatonic philosopher Isidore of Alexandria to flee Alexandria and start on a journey to Athens with the aim of studying in the neoplatonic school in Athens.

That journey took eight months, and during that time Damascius writes that he lost interest in pursuing a profession as a rhetorician. When they finally arrived in Athens, Damascius and Isidore became students of the 5th-century neoplatonist Marinus of Neapolis, Proclus&#x27; successor, at the neoplatonic school of Athens. By 515 AD, Damascius had become head of the neoplatonic school in Athens, succeeding Marinus of Neapolis successor Isidore, and continued Isidore&#x27;s path of steering the school back to the philosophical studies of Aristotle, Plato, Orphic theogony and the Chaldean Oracles, and away from theurgy and rituals, which were previously being favoured, most likely due to the increasing external pressure on the school&#x27;s philosophical teachings. Damascius was still the head of the school in 529 AD after the Byzantine emperor Justinian I confirmed his &quot;Novum Justinianeum Codicem&quot;, or &quot;Codex Justinianus&quot;, on the 7th of April 529 AD; and administrators enforcing the new laws, after they had legal force on the 16th of April 529 AD, closed the last neoplatonic school in Athens.

According to the 6th-century historian Agathias, soon after the school closed in 529 AD, Damascius, Isidore and the 6th-century neoplatonic philosophers Simplicius of Cilicia, Eulamius of Phrygia, Priscianus of Lydia, Hermias and Diogenes of Phoenicia left Athens and travelled to Persia, where they had heard that the intellectual climate might be more suited to them, under the refuge of the Persian King Chosroes. It is not known if Damascius and his retinue of philosophers arrived in Persia, although late 20th- and early 21st-century scholarship by the French historian and philosopher Pierre Hadot, French scholar Michel Tardieu and German historian and philosopher Ilsetraut Hadot advanced the establishment of a neoplatonic school in Charrae (present-day Harran, Turkey) in the Persian Empire, a view that is disputed by other 21st-century scholarship. The last known trace of Damascius is an epigram carved in stele in Emesa that confirms Damascius returned to Syria in 538 AD, and that is also the year scholars say he died. Damascius composed a number of works, and a significant number of his works in fragments or derived from his writings survived, the more complete works being: the literary work &quot;Life of Isidore&quot;, or &quot;Philosophical History&quot;, preserved by Photius; and the philosophical works: &quot;Problems and Solutions Concerning First Principles&quot;; &quot;Commentary on the Parmenides&quot;; &quot;Commentary on the Phaedo&quot;; and &quot;Lectures on the Philebus&quot;.

==Writings==
His chief treatise is entitled &quot;Difficulties and Solutions of First Principles&quot; (). It examines the nature and attributes of God and the human soul. This examination is, in two respects, in striking contrast to that of certain other Neoplatonist writers. It is conspicuously free from Oriental mysticism, and it contains no polemic against Christianity, to the doctrines of which, in fact, there is no allusion. Hence the charge of impiety which Photius brings against him. In this treatise Damascius inquires into the first principle of all things, which he finds to be an unfathomable and unspeakable divine depth, being all in one, but undivided. His main result is that God is infinite, and as such, incomprehensible; that his attributes of goodness, knowledge and power are credited to him only by inference from their effects; that this inference is logically valid and sufficient for human thought. He insists throughout on the unity and the indivisibility of God. This work is, moreover, of great importance for the history of philosophy, because of the great number of accounts which it contains concerning former philosophers.

The rest of Damascius&#x27;s writings are for the most part commentaries on works of Aristotle and Plato. Surviving commentaries include: 
*Commentary on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Parmenides&quot;.
*Commentary on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;. This work has been erroneously ascribed to Olympiodorus of Alexandria.
*Commentary on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Philebus&quot;. Also erroneously ascribed to Olympiodorus.

Lost or fragmentary works include:
*Commentaries on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, &quot;First Alcibiades&quot;, and other dialogues.
*Commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De Caelo&quot;, and other works. The writings of Damascius on Time, Space, and Number, cited by Simplicius in his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physica&quot;, are perhaps parts of his commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s writings.
*&quot;Life of Isidore.&quot; Damascius&#x27;s biography of his teacher Isidore (perhaps a part of the &quot;Philosophos Historia&quot; attributed to Damascius by the Suda), of which Photius preserved a considerable fragment. It is considered the source containing most details about the life of Ammonius Hermiae, and is also a primary source for the life of Hypatia. Incorporating material from both the Suda and Photius, a reconstructed text was translated into English by Polymnia Athanassiadi and published in 1999 as &quot;Damascius. The Philosophical History.&quot; 
*&quot;Logoi Paradoxoi&quot;, in 4 books, of which Photius gives an account and specifies the respective titles of the books.

=== Damascius and the &quot;Corpus Dionysiacum&quot; ===
Starting from an article published in 2006, Byzantine philologist Carlo Maria Mazzucchi has argued that Damascius was the author of the Pseudo-Dionysian corpus, the &quot;last counter-offensive of Paganism&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;ultima controffensiva del paganesimo&quot;). Mazzucchi&#x27;s theory, which faced some criticism, was later improved with more arguments.

<text>A chemical composition specifies the identity, arrangement, and ratio of the chemical elements making up a compound by way of chemical and atomic bonds.

Chemical formulas can be used to describe the relative amounts of elements present in a compound. For example, the chemical formula for water is H2O: this means that each molecule of water is constituted by 2 atoms of hydrogen (H) and 1 atom of oxygen (O). The chemical composition of water may be interpreted as a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms. Different types of chemical formulas are used to convey composition information, such as an empirical or molecular formula.

Nomenclature can be used to express not only the elements present in a compound but their arrangement within the molecules of the compound. In this way, compounds will have unique names which can describe their elemental composition.

==Composite mixture==

The chemical composition of a mixture can be defined as the distribution of the individual substances that constitute the mixture, called &quot;components&quot;. In other words, it is equivalent to quantifying the concentration of each component. Because there are different ways to define the concentration of a component, there are also different ways to define the composition of a mixture. It may be expressed as molar fraction, volume fraction, mass fraction, molality, molarity or normality or mixing ratio.

Chemical composition of a mixture can be represented graphically in plots like ternary plot and quaternary plot.

<text>A crozier or crosier (also known as a paterissa, pastoral staff, or bishop&#x27;s staff) is a stylized staff that is a symbol of the governing office of a bishop or abbot and is carried by high-ranking prelates of Roman Catholic, Eastern Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church, and some Anglican, Lutheran, United Methodist and Pentecostal churches.

In Western Christianity the crozier typically takes the form of a shepherd&#x27;s crook, a tool used to manage flocks of sheep and herds of goats. In Eastern Christianity, the crozier has two common forms: tau-shaped, with curved arms, surmounted by a small cross; or a pair of sculptured serpents or dragons curled back to face each other, with a small cross between them.

Other typical insignia of prelates are the mitre, the pectoral cross, and the episcopal ring.

== History ==
The origin of the crozier as a staff of authority is uncertain, but there were many secular and religious precedents in the ancient world. One example is the lituus, the traditional staff of the ancient Roman augurs, as well as the Staff of Moses in the Hebrew Bible. Many other types of the staff of office were found in later periods, some continuing to the modern day in ceremonial contexts.

In the Western Church, the usual form has been a shepherd&#x27;s crook. This relates to the many metaphorical references to bishops as the shepherds of their &quot;flock&quot; of Christians, following the metaphor of Christ as the Good Shepherd.

The Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic crozier is commonly tau-shaped, with curved arms and surmounted by a small cross, or with a pair of sculptured serpents or dragons on top, curled back to face each other, and a small cross between them. The symbolism in the latter case is of the bronze serpent, Nehushtan, made by Moses as related in . It is also reminiscent of the rod of the ancient Greek god Asclepius, whose worship was centered around the Aegean, including Asia Minor, indicating the role of the bishop as healer of spiritual diseases.

===Staff of Moses===
The Staff of Moses is first mentioned in the Book of Exodus (chapter 4, verse 2), when God appears to Moses in the burning bush. God asks what Moses has in his hand, and Moses answers &quot;a staff&quot; (&quot;a rod&quot; in the King James Version). The staff is miraculously transformed into a snake and then back into a staff. The staff is thereafter referred to as the &quot;rod of God&quot; or &quot;staff of God&quot; (depending on the translation).

Moses and Aaron appear before the Pharaoh of the Exodus, when Aaron&#x27;s rod is transformed into a serpent. The Pharaoh&#x27;s sorcerers are also able to transform their own rods into serpents, but Aaron&#x27;s swallows them. Aaron&#x27;s rod is again used to turn the Nile blood-red. It is used several times on God&#x27;s command to initiate the Plagues of Egypt.

During the Exodus, Moses stretches out his hand with the staff to part the Red Sea. While in the wilderness after leaving Egypt, Moses does not follow God&#x27;s command to &quot;speak ye unto the rock before their eyes&quot;, instead he strikes the rock with the rod to create a spring for the Israelites from which to drink. Because Moses did not sanctify God before them but said &quot;Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?&quot; Thus, Moses failed by honoring himself and not God. For not doing what God commanded, God punished Moses by not letting him enter into the Promised Land (Book of Numbers 20:10–12).

Finally, Moses uses the staff in the battle at Rephidim between the Israelites and the Amalekites. When he holds up the &quot;rod of God&quot;, the Israelites &quot;prevail&quot;. When he drops it, their enemies gain the upper hand. Aaron and Hur help him to keep the staff raised until victory is achieved.

== Official use ==

The crozier is the symbol of the governing office of a bishop, abbot, or Apostle.

=== Western Christianity ===
In Western Christianity, the crozier (known as the pastoral staff, from the Latin &quot;pastor&quot;, shepherd) is shaped like a shepherd&#x27;s crook. A bishop or church head bears this staff as &quot;shepherd of the flock of God&quot;, particularly the community under his canonical jurisdiction, but any bishop, whether or not assigned to a functional diocese, may also use a crozier when conferring sacraments and presiding at liturgies. The Catholic Caeremoniale Episcoporum says that, as a sign of his pastoral function, a bishop uses a crozier within his territory, but any bishop celebrating the liturgy solemnly with the consent of the local bishop may also use it. It adds that, when several bishops join in a single celebration, only the one presiding uses a crozier.

A bishop usually holds his crozier with his left hand, leaving his right hand free to bestow blessings. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum states that the bishop holds the crozier with the open side of the crook forward, or towards the people. It also states that a bishop usually holds the crozier during a procession and when listening to the reading of the Gospel, giving a homily, accepting vows, solemn promises or a profession of faith, and when blessing people, unless he must lay his hands on them. When the bishop is not holding the crozier, it is put in the care of an altar server, known as the &quot;crozier bearer&quot;, who may wear around their shoulders a shawl-like veil called a vimpa, so as to hold the crozier without touching it with their bare hands. Another altar server, likewise wearing a vimpa, holds the mitre when the bishop is not wearing it. In the Anglican tradition, the crozier may be carried by someone else walking before the bishop in a procession.

The crozier is conferred upon a bishop during his ordination to the episcopacy. It is also presented to an abbot at his blessing, an ancient custom symbolizing his shepherding of the monastic community. Although there is no provision for the presentation of a crozier in the liturgy associated with the blessing of an abbess, by long-standing custom an abbess may bear one when leading her community of nuns.

The traditional explanation of the crozier&#x27;s form is that, as a shepherd&#x27;s staff, it includes a hook at one end to pull back to the flock any straying sheep, a pointed finial at the other tip to goad the reluctant and the lazy, and a rod in between as a strong support.

The crozier is used in ecclesiastical heraldry to represent pastoral authority in the coats of arms of cardinals, bishops, abbots and abbesses. It was suppressed in most personal arms in the Catholic Church in 1969, and is since found on arms of abbots and abbesses, diocesan coats of arms and other corporate arms.

In the Church of God in Christ, the largest Pentecostal church in the United States, the presiding bishop bears a crozier as a sign of his role as positional and functional leader of the Church. In some jurisdictions of the United Methodist Church, bishops make use of croziers at ceremonial events.

==== Papal usage ====

Popes no longer carry a crozier and instead carry the papal ferula. In the first centuries of the church, popes did carry a crozier but this practice was phased out and disappeared by the time of Pope Innocent III in the thirteenth century. In the Middle Ages, much as bishops carried a crozier, popes carried a papal cross with three bars, one more than the two bars found on croziers carried before archbishops in processions (see archiepiscopal cross). This too was phased out. Pope Paul VI introduced the modern papal pastoral staff, the papal ferula, in 1965. He and his successors have carried a few versions of this staff, but never a crozier.

=== Eastern Christianity ===

In Eastern Christianity (Oriental Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism), bishops use a similar pastoral staff. When a bishop is consecrated, the crozier (, Slavonic: &quot;pósokh&quot;) is presented to him by the chief consecrator following the dismissal at the Divine Liturgy.

The Archbishop of Cyprus has the unique privilege in canon law of carrying a &quot;paterissa&quot; shaped like an imperial sceptre. This is one of the &quot;Three Privileges&quot; granted to the Orthodox Church of Cyprus by Byzantine Emperor Zeno (the other two being to sign his name in cinnabar, i.e., ink coloured vermilion by the addition of the mineral cinnabar, and to wear purple instead of black cassocks under his vestments).

An Eastern archimandrite (high-ranking abbot), hegumen (abbot) or hegumenia (abbess) who leads a monastic community also bears a crozier. It is conferred on them by the bishop during the Divine Liturgy for the elevation of the candidate. When he is not vested for worship, a bishop, archimandrite or abbot uses a staff of office topped with a silver pommel.

==== Oriental Orthodoxy ====
In the Oriental Orthodox churches, croziers are used as pastoral staffs held by bishops. The Armenian Apostolic Church uses both Eastern- and Western-style croziers, while the Syriac Orthodox Church,Indian Orthodox Church and Marthoma Syrian Church have croziers that are thicker than their Eastern counterparts. Clerics of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church use croziers that look exactly like the Greek ones.

In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, croziers are sometimes somewhat longer and are always decorated with a blood red cloth around the top cross and the serpents. This symbolizes the bishop&#x27;s responsibility for the blood of his flock.

== Description ==
Croziers are often made or decorated in precious metals, or are at least gilded or silver-plated. Underneath, the core and shaft is often wood, and some are entirely made of wood, though this is more common for croziers carried by abbots rather than bishops. Ivory, from the walrus or elephant, was often used in the Middle Ages.

=== Western croziers ===
Croziers used by Western bishops have curved or hooked tops, similar in appearance to staves traditionally used by shepherds, hence they are also known as crooks. In some languages there is only one term referring to this form, such as the German &quot;Krummstab&quot; or Dutch &quot;kromstaf&quot;. The crook itself (i.e., the curved top portion) may be formed as a simple shepherd&#x27;s crook, terminating in a floral pattern, reminiscent of the Aaron&#x27;s rod, or in a serpent&#x27;s head. It may encircle a depiction of the bishop&#x27;s coat of arms or the figure of a saint. In some very ornate croziers, the place where the staff meets the crook may be designed to represent a church.
Insular croziers, produced in Britain and Ireland in the Early Middle Ages, have a more simple shape, perhaps closer to actual shepherd&#x27;s crooks. They were regarded as important relics of church leaders, and have survived in untypical numbers, including the Clonmacnoise Crozier, Kells Crozier, Lismore Crozier, Prosperous Crozier, River Laune Crozier, St. Columba&#x27;s Crozier, St. Fillan&#x27;s Crozier, and St. Mel&#x27;s Crozier.

In previous times, a cloth of linen or richer material, called the &quot;sudarium&quot; (literally, &quot;sweat cloth&quot;), was suspended from the crozier at the place where the bishop would grasp it. This was originally a practical application which prevented the bishop&#x27;s hand from sweating and discolouring (or being discoloured by) the metal. The invention of stainless steel in the late 19th century and its subsequent incorporation in material used for croziers rendered moot its original purpose and it became more elaborate and ceremonial in function over time. In heraldry, the &quot;sudarium&quot; is often still depicted when croziers occur on coats of arms.

In the Roman Catholic Church, the crozier is always carried by the bishop with the crook turned away from himself; that is to say, facing toward the persons or objects he is facing, regardless of whether he is the Ordinary or not. The Sacred Congregation of Rites on 26 November 1919, stated in a reply to the following question,
=== Eastern croziers ===
The croziers carried by Eastern bishops, archimandrites, abbots and abbesses differ in design from the Western crozier. The Eastern crozier is shaped more like a crutch than a shepherd&#x27;s staff.

The &quot;sudarium&quot; or crozier mantle is still used in the Eastern churches, where it is usually made of a rich fabric such as brocade or velvet, and usually embroidered with a cross or other religious symbol, trimmed with galoon around the edges and fringed at the bottom. The &quot;sudarium&quot; is normally a rectangular piece of fabric with a string sewn into the upper edge which is used to tie the &quot;sudarium&quot; to the crozier that can be drawn together to form pleats. As the sudarium has grown more elaborate, bishops no longer hold it between their hand and the crozier, but place their hand under it as they grasp the crozier, so that it is visible.

<doc id="159156" wikidata="Q285543" url="?curid=159156" title="Alessandra Mussolini">
<text>Alessandra Mussolini (born 30 December 1962) is an Italian politician, television personality, model and former actress and singer. Mussolini has been a member of both houses of the Italian Parliament as well as the European Parliament. She is also known for being a member of the Mussolini family as a granddaughter of Benito Mussolini. Since 2022, she has been a Member of the European Parliament for Forza Italia.

Mussolini first gained fame through acting and modelling. In 1982, as a singer, she released a city pop album entitled &quot;Amore&quot;. Mussolini starred in her final film in 1990 and left the industry after a producer asked her to change her name.

In 2004, she became the first woman to lead a political party in Italy when she founded the national conservative political party Social Action. She was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 2008 to 2013 and the Italian Senate from 2013 to 2014 where she was elected under &quot;The People of Freedom&quot; which later became part of Forza Italia. She was elected to the European Parliament in 2014.

Mussolini left politics temporarily in December 2020 for a reality television career. She returned as an MEP in November 2022, succeeding Antonio Tajani, after he was appointed in the Meloni government.

==Early and personal life==
Alessandra Mussolini was born in Rome, the daughter of Romano Mussolini, the fourth child of Benito Mussolini, fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943, and Marianna Pia Villani Scicolone (born 11 May 1938, Rome). Actress Sophia Loren is her maternal aunt. She has a half-sister, Rachele Mussolini, who is also a politician as a member of Brothers of Italy.

From 1976 to 1980 she went to high school at the American Overseas School of Rome. She graduated in 1994 from Sapienza University of Rome, where she got her Master of Science in medicine and surgery.

She married customs policeman Mauro Floriani on 28 October 1989. Contrary to tradition, she proposed to him. Together they have three children, Caterina, Clarissa, and Romano — the last named after his grandfather. Later, the children adopted their mother&#x27;s surname, but she went through a complex legal process to allow them to do so. She has since campaigned for Italian law to be changed to allow all children to take their mother&#x27;s last name if they wish.

Her husband was one of the accused scheduled to appear in court for a child prostitution trial in 2015. In 2013, Floriani was one of around 50 men—among them celebrities, professionals, priests, journalists and politicians—who were accused of paying two teenage girls, aged 14 and 15, for sexual services in Rome. Wiretaps revealed he was one of the clients who contacted the girls most often. In 2015, Floriani pled guilty to soliciting the services of an underage prostitute, and received a one-year suspended sentence.

She is first cousin once-removed to Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s great-grandson, who ran for the Fratelli d’Italia party in the 2019 European Parliament election. She considers herself Roman Catholic, although she does not attend Mass regularly.

In 2001, Mussolini was involved in an altercation while filming for a Porta a Porta talk show episode on sexual harassment. She was verbally accosted by Katia Bellillo, then Minister for Equal Opportunities, who got up and approached Mussolini. In response Mussolini verbally and physically attacked Bellillo, calling her an &quot;ugly communist&quot; who should &quot;go and live in Cuba.&quot;

She has been a painter since 2014 and her first solo exhibition was held during 2015 in Rome.

==Entertainment career==
Mussolini was taken under the wing of her aunt Sophia Loren for a while and started a career as an actress in the Italian film industry during the 1970s. &quot;A Special Day&quot; (1977), in which she had a minor role as &quot;Maria Luisa,&quot; won an American Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

During 1982, Mussolini released a pop music album of romantic songs under the title &quot;Amore&quot; on Alfa Records; the album was released only in Japan and has since become something of a collectors item.

Mussolini also appeared as a glamour model, including on the cover of two European editions of &quot;Playboy&quot;, in Italy (August 1983) and Germany (November 1983). &quot;When you are an actress, you are dealing with the body. Every actress does topless and stuff like this; you have to,&quot; she has said.

Mussolini continued as an actress into the 1980s. Some of the films she featured in were made for Italian television. However, she still acted in standard cinematic films, such as &quot;The Assisi Underground&quot; in which she played a nun; the movie focused on the Roman Catholic Church rescuing Italian Jews from the Nazis in 1943. She starred in her final film in 1990 and then left the film industry to continue studying after a producer asked her to change her name.

==Political career==

===Italian Parliament===
In 1992, Alessandra Mussolini was elected to parliament in a Naples constituency as a member of the Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI). After the Italian general elections of April 2008, Mussolini served as a member of the Italian parliament within Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s alliance of right wing parties, The People of Freedom.

In the Italian general election of February 2013, she was elected to the Senate of the Republic as a member of The People of Freedom. The party was transformed into a new Forza Italia in November 2013. In the 2014 European Parliament election, Mussolini was elected to the EP for Forza Italia.

===Mayoral candidate===
In 1993 Mussolini was a candidate for the post of mayor of Naples, but was defeated by Antonio Bassolino. She claimed that her relations with Gianfranco Fini, leader of the Alleanza Nazionale, never were very good; she then later withdrew, resigning over differences with him at least once. She unsuccessfully challenged him for the leadership of the party when he withdrew support for Mussolini in a television interview in January 2002.

===Formation of Social Action===
Mussolini suddenly left the National Alliance on 28 November 2003, following the visit of party leader and the Deputy Prime Minister Gianfranco Fini to Israel, where he described fascism as part &quot;the absolute evil&quot; with regard to the Holocaust as he apologised for Italy&#x27;s role as an Axis Power during the Second World War. Mussolini, however, defended the right of Israel to exist and declared that the world &quot;should beg forgiveness of Israel.&quot;

Following her resignation, Mussolini formed her Social Action party, originally named &quot;Freedom of Action,&quot; and organised a coalition named Social Alternative. This made her the first female leader of an Italian political party. The move was read in the Italian media as surprising because of Mussolini&#x27;s &quot;progressive&quot; stances on many issues, including abortion, artificial insemination, gay rights and civil unions. She has been an outspoken feminist and has been described by conservative commentators as a &quot;socialist&quot; and a &quot;left-winger.&quot;

===European Parliament===
In the 2004 European Parliament election, Social Alternative, gained 1.2% of the electoral list vote. Mussolini herself received 133,000 preference votes.

In response to a comment made by UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom in which he said that &quot;No self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age. That isn&#x27;t politically correct, is it, but it&#x27;s a fact of life. The more women&#x27;s rights you have, it&#x27;s actually a bar to their employment.&quot; and: &quot;I just don&#x27;t think [women] clean behind the fridge enough,&quot; Mussolini responded by saying 

In March 2005, Mussolini was banned by a local court from regional elections held the following month for presenting fraudulent signatures. &quot;This is an affront to democracy, if they&#x27;re going to exclude the Social Alternative they will have to exclude all the parties, because all the signature lists are false,&quot; Mussolini told Reuters. Mussolini went on a hunger strike to protest the decision. However, at the end of the month Italy&#x27;s top administrative court, the Council of State, annulled the decision and she stood for election.

In November 2007, remarks by Mussolini triggered the collapse of the far-right Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty grouping within the European Parliament. Mussolini declared that all Romanians were criminals in remarks regarding immigration policy. This prompted delegates from the Greater Romania Party to quit the group, bringing the group below the minimum number of members to qualify as a caucus and receive Parliamentary funding. In the 2019 European Parliament election, she lost her bid for re-election to the European Parliament.

===Views on social issues===
In 2006, she responded to claims by the transgender Italian parliamentary candidate Vladimir Luxuria that she was a &quot;fascist&quot; by saying that it would be better to be a fascist than it would be to be gay.

Her stance on homosexuality changed consistently from the late 2000s. In 2010, Mussolini condemned the Vatican&#x27;s comparison of homosexuality with paedophilia, stating &quot;You can&#x27;t link sexual orientation to pedophilia … this link risks becoming dangerously misleading for the protection of children&quot;. In 2022, she supported the anti-homophobia &quot;Zan bill&quot; and she refused to provide her gender information on her MEP identity card after returning to the European Parliament.

===End of political career===
She left Forza Italia in 2018, following the party&#x27;s decision to be in opposition to the Conte government. She has used Twitter to defend the memory of her grandfather from critics such as actor Jim Carrey, and fans of Scottish football club Celtic F.C.

In December 2020, she left politics for a new television career. She took part, as contestant, in Milly Carlucci&#x27;s &quot;Ballando con le stelle&quot; and in Carlo Conti&#x27;s &quot;Tale e quale show&quot; obtaining success.

=== Return to politics ===
In November 2022, Mussolini returned to politics to replace Antonio Tajani as a Forza Italia MEP after his election to the Chamber of Deputies.

<doc id="159159" wikidata="Q902506" url="?curid=159159" title="Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.">
<text>Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. is the first album recorded by American heavy metal band Slipknot, and their only release with original lead vocalist Anders Colsefni. The album was limited to 1,000 copies, with distribution beginning on October 31, 1996. The band sold the last 386 units through ismist Recordings in 1997. The album has become sought after by fans since Slipknot&#x27;s rise to fame, and original copies have sold for up to $1,000.

Despite originally being deemed Slipknot&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.&quot; was later considered a demo by the band, who have included the majority of its songs on subsequent releases, albeit usually in radically altered forms. The record was recorded in Des Moines, Iowa over a period of four months and features many musical influences including funk, jazz, and disco which are not apparent in later material. Many of the lyrics and the album&#x27;s title are inspired by the role-playing game &quot;&quot;. According to Allmusic, the songs contain a stronger &quot;emphasis on non-traditional songwriting&quot; and melodic themes than the band&#x27;s later material.

==Recording and production==
In late 1995, Slipknot and producer Sean McMahon entered SR Audio, a studio in the band&#x27;s hometown of Des Moines, Iowa to work on what they intended to be their debut album. Retrospectively, McMahon said that the band was &quot;driven&quot; because they spent the majority of their time in the studio for the four months it took to produce the album. Slipknot self-financed the production, which came to an estimated $40,000. The band expressed how much of a learning process this time was, being the first time they had recorded their music, specifically the challenge of capturing additional percussion elements.

The band aimed for a tribal sound, but encountered problems including minuscule timing errors. However, during this period, Slipknot refined their percussive sound by experimenting with erecting walls to isolate the drums and rearranging parts. In February 1996, during the mixing process, guitarist Donnie Steele decided to leave the band for religious reasons and as a result, Craig Jones joined the band to fill the spot. However, the band realized that they were incorporating too many media samples on their recordings and could not replicate these sounds live. To solve this problem, Jones abandoned his position on guitar and moved to the position of sampler—at that point Mick Thomson stepped in to join as guitarist. Originally, the band had planned to include twelve tracks on the CD, two of which – &quot;Fur&quot; (also known as &quot;Fur Covered In Blood&quot;) and &quot;Part of Me&quot; – already appeared on their first demo in 1995. In the end, &quot;Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.&quot; was released with only eight tracks. The band threw a release party at The Safari, a club in Des Moines where the band played many of their earliest gigs.

==Musical and lyrical themes==
&quot;Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.&quot; is a mix of genres centered on nu metal and death metal; it is the band&#x27;s most experimental release and differs significantly from the heavier style for which the band became known. One of the band&#x27;s initial aims was to mix many genres of music to achieve their own style; an early incarnation of the band was called &quot;Meld&quot; based upon this. However, tracks such as &quot;Slipknot&quot;, &quot;Some Feel&quot; and &quot;Only One&quot; feature a heavy metal influence, specifically in the guitars. Tracks such as &quot;Tattered &amp; Torn&quot;, &quot;Killers Are Quiet&quot; and &quot;Gently&quot; also include the slow, cerebral angst buildup style that the band retained in some of their more recent work. The album implements elements of jazz and funk, although &quot;Confessions&quot; is the only track on the album led by these styles. &quot;Do Nothing/Bitchslap&quot; could be considered the album&#x27;s most complex song, combining both of these styles and even elements of disco.

The album title and the majority of the lyrics are references to the role-playing game &quot;&quot;. Vocalist Anders Colsefni and percussionist Shawn Crahan shared a mutual interest in the game, which largely influenced the band. Colsefni said: &quot;The attraction was being able to play a different person&quot;, declaring that this was the essence of Slipknot.

This cage was named &quot;Patiently Awaiting the Jigsaw Flesh&quot;, as whenever they carried the cage, someone got cut brutally. It was also known as the &quot;Death Cage&quot; and was a part of the stage show during the release party of the album. Willing &quot;victims&quot; sat inside of it while the band played.

==Legacy==

The original pressing of the album was limited to 1000 copies. Since the band&#x27;s rise to fame in 1999, it has been a sought-after rarity for Slipknot fans. Upon its initial release, the band distributed the album independently, handing them out to fans, radio stations, and record labels. On June 13, 1997, ismist Recordings took over the distribution of the remaining 386 copies of the album. These original pressings have since grown in value considerably. Due to the large amount of interest in the album and the low numbers of originals, there have been many bootlegged versions of the album sold including CD, MP3 and even vinyl.

The barcode of the original CD is the number &quot;742617000027&quot;, which later went on to become the name for the opening track of their first official release, &quot;Slipknot&quot;.

As part of the Nu Metal Mayhem tour with Waylon Reavis, which took place in Australia and New Zealand in October 2023, Anders Colsefni performed the album in its entirety.

A re-recorded version of the album by New Zealand band Kaosis with Anders Colsefni was released on March 15, 2024. However, Colsefni quickly disowned the release, stating that he had not signed off on the final mix, nor any of the release details.

<doc id="159161" wikidata="Q828268" url="?curid=159161" title="Iowa (album)">
<text>Iowa is the second studio album by the American heavy metal band Slipknot. Produced by the members and Ross Robinson, it was released on August 28, 2001, by Roadrunner Records. The title refers the band&#x27;s state origin, Iowa, which members have stated is one of their greatest sources of inspiration. With much anticipation for the album following the success of their 1999 debut album &quot;Slipknot&quot;, pressures on the band were high. Their relationships with each other suffered and this was later described as the darkest time of their career. It was also the first full album to feature guitarist Jim Root after only appearing on one song from their previous album. Despite troubles within the band and with &quot;Iowa&quot;″s development, Slipknot promoted it for almost a year.

The album was a major success, premiering in the top tens of nine countries. Generally positively received, it includes some of their notable songs, such as &quot;Disasterpiece&quot;, &quot;The Heretic Anthem&quot;, &quot;People = Shit&quot; and the Grammy-nominated &quot;Left Behind&quot; and &quot;My Plague&quot;. More technical than their debut, &quot;Iowa&quot; is considered the band&#x27;s heaviest and darkest album. It has been certified platinum in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.

A special edition of &quot;Iowa&quot; was reissued on November 1, 2011, to celebrate its tenth anniversary. It was accompanied by full live audio of the hit DVD &quot;Disasterpieces&quot; and a film entitled &quot;Goat&quot; directed by Shawn Crahan, with the four music videos, never-seen-before interviews and footage from the &quot;Iowa&quot; period.

==Recording and production==
&quot;Iowa&quot; was recorded and produced at Sound City Studios and Sound Image Studios in Los Angeles, California with producer Ross Robinson, who had also produced their debut album. Drummer Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray began working on new music together in October 2000, and wrote material for most of the album. During this time, other members took a break after the extensive touring that had followed their debut. On January 17, 2001, Slipknot entered the studio to begin recording new material. Recording began on January 22. This period in the band&#x27;s career became known as one of their worst. Jordison recalled, &quot;That&#x27;s where we got into a war,&quot; citing the lack of a break for himself and Gray. Other factors, including vocalist Corey Taylor&#x27;s alcohol addiction, other members&#x27; drug addictions, and management issues affected relations in the band.

&quot;Recording &quot;Iowa&quot; was fucking hell,&quot; recalled Shawn Crahan. &quot;I wanted to kill myself. There was drugs, bitches, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, all that shit. People expected so much of us then. &#x27;People = Shit&#x27; was our way of saying, &#x27;Fuck off and leave us alone.&#x27;&quot; &quot;There was nothing happy about &quot;Iowa&quot;,&quot; confirmed Taylor. &quot;All of a sudden we were these metal stars and we weren&#x27;t really planning for it… We&#x27;d all got caught up in the lifestyle and the problems that come with that. A darkness set in at the beginning of &quot;Iowa&quot; that none of us quite recognised.&quot; Jordison, however, noted, &quot;&quot;Iowa&quot;, even more than the first record, was the album we really wanted to make.&quot;

It was the first album where guitarist Jim Root had been significantly involved, after joining during the later recording stages of &quot;Slipknot&quot;. During an interview with &quot;Guitar&quot; magazine in November 2001, Root explained, &quot;It was so exciting as well as scary to be part of this whole huge process,&quot; adding that there was a lot of pressure from fellow guitarist Mick Thomson to perform well.

To &quot;FHM&quot;, Taylor revealed that he put himself in specific situations to achieve his performance on the album. While recording vocals for the closing title track, he was completely naked, vomiting all over himself, and cutting himself with broken glass. &quot;That&#x27;s where the best stuff comes from,&quot; he explained. &quot;You&#x27;ve got to break yourself down before you can build something great.&quot; While producing the album, Ross Robinson was injured in a dirt bike accident, suffering a fractured back in the process. He returned to the studio after a day of hospital treatment, reportedly &quot;putting all of his pain into the album&quot;, much to the admiration of the band. 

Recording was completed on March 16, 2001.

==Music and lyrical themes==
Prior to its release, members promised a much darker and heavier album than &quot;Slipknot&quot;, and many sources praised the band for fulfilling their promises. In 2008, percussionist Shawn Crahan recalled: &quot;When we did &quot;Iowa&quot;, we hated each other. We hated the world; the world hated us.&quot;

&quot;Iowa&quot;, unlike its predecessor, saw Robinson capturing the band&#x27;s technicality as opposed to the raw energy which &quot;Slipknot&quot; became known for. The band was also praised again for its use of an extended line-up consisting of additional percussionists, turntables, and programmed samples. &quot;NME&quot; stated that &quot;every possible space is covered in scrawl and cymbals: guitars, percussion, electronic squall, subhuman screaming.&quot; &quot;Iowa&quot; has also been critically acclaimed as one of the only mainstream musical albums to feature blast beat percussion, and was said to heighten its popularity after release.

Although &quot;Iowa&quot; became widely regarded as the band&#x27;s heaviest album to date, some tracks incorporate melody, most apparent in the record’s singles such as &quot;My Plague&quot; and &quot;Left Behind&quot;. During the album&#x27;s thirteenth anniversary, &quot;Revolver&quot; recalled that the record is &quot;their most extreme album yet&quot;. They compared several songs, namely &quot;Disasterpiece,&quot; &quot;People = Shit&quot; and &quot;The Heretic Anthem&quot; as more death metal-influenced than most of the that the album contained. While the album does have elements of hip hop music, &quot;Iowa&quot; has less hip hop elements than Slipknot&#x27;s self-titled album, and instead draws its influences moreso on heavy genres like death metal and hardcore punk. The title track is also known for being the band’s longest continuous song released, clocking in at just over 15 minutes.

&quot;Iowa&quot; follows the lyrical style that vocalist Corey Taylor established on Slipknot&#x27;s debut; it includes strong use of metaphors to describe dark themes including misanthropy, solipsism, disgust, anger, disaffection, psychosis, and rejection. The album also includes many expletives; David Fricke of the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine said &quot;there isn&#x27;t much shock value left in the words fuck and shit, which Taylor uses in some variation more than forty times in &quot;Iowa&quot;″s sixty-six minutes.&quot; Fricke went on to praise Taylor&#x27;s performance on the track &quot;Iowa&quot;, comparing it to a &quot;vivid evocation of a makeshift-cornfield grave at midnight.&quot;

&quot;Disasterpiece&quot;, said Taylor, &quot;is my favorite Slipknot song. We started doing pre-production for the album in a warehouse in Iowa itself. I had laryngitis and couldn&#x27;t sing a note, so I was writing a lot of ideas down. When I heard them play &#x27;Disasterpiece&#x27;, I just wrote &#x27;No one is safe&#x27; in huge letters. I knew from then that we were going to rip the throat out of the world with &#x27;Disasterpiece&#x27;. That was the lynchpin for the whole album.&quot;

==Promotion==
There was speculation over the title before its announcement with &quot;Nine Men, One Mission&quot; as the expected title in some sources. &quot;Iowa&quot; was later announced as its title and was named after the band&#x27;s home state of Iowa. Members have claimed that Iowa was the source of their energy, and they consciously made the decision to stay in the area, partially due to the fear of losing their creative direction. The opening track &quot;(515)&quot; is also a reference to their home state, named after the telephone area code for central Iowa. Initially the album was scheduled for release on June 19, 2001, and was to be preceded by a five-date warm-up tour. However, the mixing of the album took longer than anticipated, causing the album&#x27;s release to be delayed, as well as the cancellation of the tour. The album was officially released on August 28, 2001. In support of the album, Slipknot began a new tour called the Iowa World Tour. This included: a spot on Ozzfest in 2001, an American co-headlining tour with System of a Down, as well as tours in Japan, Europe and elsewhere.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Slipknot gave away copies of &quot;Heretic Song&quot; (titled &quot;The Heretic Anthem&quot; on the retail release), free on their website. It was limited to 666 copies, to match the chorus; &quot;If you&#x27;re 555, then I&#x27;m 666.&quot; The giveaway began on May 15, 2001, and lasted until copies sold out. The first official single released from the album was &quot;Left Behind&quot;. In 2002, the band made a special appearance in the film &quot;Rollerball&quot;, in which they performed &quot;I Am Hated&quot;. Following this, a second single from the album was released, &quot;My Plague&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Resident Evil&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Following the success of the band&#x27;s self-titled album, author Dick Porter wrote that the anticipation for a follow-up was intense. Prior to its release, Jordison proclaimed: &quot;Wait till you hear our fuckin&#x27; next record. It smokes our first album. The shit&#x27;s twice as technical, three times as heavy.&quot; 

Iowa earned generally favorable reviews. The &quot;College Music Journal&quot; reviewed it as &quot;brutal, unrelenting, scorching...&quot; Many noted its heavy themes: &quot;Alternative Press&quot; stated, &quot;[It is] like having a plastic bag taped over your head for an hour while Satan uses your scrotum as a speedbag...[It] is over the top… you&#x27;re going to be left in stitches.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; said that it is &quot;Exhilarating, brutal and good.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; credited the album for its originality, stating that &quot;nearly everything else in modern doom rock sounds banal.&quot; In its &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Yearbook&quot; (2001), &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared, &quot;Do not discount the purgative worth of Slipknot&#x27;s head-spinning riffage and singer Corey Taylor&#x27;s consumptive growl in &#x27;People = Shit&#x27; and &#x27;The Heretic Anthem&#x27;. &quot;Iowa&quot; is the sound of hell boiling over.&quot;

Producer Robinson was praised for his work: &quot;Uncut&quot; noted, &quot;The barely relenting, tumbling noise attack marshalled by nu metal uber-producer Ross Robinson is expert.&quot; Reviewing for Yahoo!, John Mulvey said, &quot;They&#x27;re an evolutionary dead end, the final, absolute triumph of nu metal.&quot;

The first single, &quot;Left Behind&quot;, was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 44th Grammy Awards. The second single, &quot;My Plague&quot;, was nominated in 2003 for the same award at the 45th Grammy Awards. The single &quot;Left Behind&quot; peaked in the top thirty for single sales the United States and the UK. In addition, &quot;My Plague&quot; reached the 43rd position on the UK charts. &quot;Iowa&quot; was ranked sixth in the &quot;50 Albums of the year&quot; by &quot;NME&quot; in 2001. The album reached the top position on the UK Albums Chart, and the second spot on the ARIA Charts in Australia. The album reached the third spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Finnish Albums Chart. On October 10, 2001, the album was certified Platinum in the United States. In Canada, the Canadian Recording Industry Association certified the album as Platinum, on September 5, 2001. The British Phonographic Industry has certified the album as Gold in the UK.

In 2009, &quot;Iowa&quot; was rated third in UK magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s &quot;The 50 Best Albums of the 21st century&quot; reader poll. &quot;Loudwire&quot; listed &quot;Iowa&quot; at number two in their &quot;Top 11 albums of the 2000s&quot; and number six in their &quot;Top 100 albums of the 21st century&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Iowa&quot; as 50th on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.&#x27; Later in 2023, the same magazine ranked the album&#x27;s second song, &quot;People = Shit&quot;, number sixty on their list on &quot;The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs&quot;.

<doc id="159162" wikidata="Q743725" url="?curid=159162" title="Slipknot (album)">
<text>Slipknot is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Slipknot. It was released on June 29, 1999, by Roadrunner Records, following a demo containing a few of the songs which had previously been released in 1998. Later, it was reissued in December 1999 with a slightly-altered track listing and mastering as the result of a lawsuit. It was the first release by the band to be produced by Ross Robinson, who sought to refine Slipknot&#x27;s sound rather than alter the group&#x27;s musical direction. This is the only album to feature original guitarist Josh Brainard who left at the end of recording in late 1998 while the band was taking a brief break. Jim Root, who recorded two tracks at this point, would appear full time on subsequent albums starting with their next album &quot;Iowa&quot;.

The album spans several genres, but is generally noted for its extensive percussion and overall heavy sound. It was well received by fans and critics alike and was responsible for bringing Slipknot a large increase in popularity. The album peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and has gone on to become certified double platinum in the United States, making it the band&#x27;s best-selling album. In 2011, it was voted the best debut album of the last 25 years by readers of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

==Recording and production==
In 1997, following the band&#x27;s demo release, &quot;Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.&quot;, the members of Slipknot continued to write new material and work in SR Audio, a local studio, with new vocalist Corey Taylor. The band began to work on a follow-up, but were never able to go further than pre-production. Songs written and recorded in this period include &quot;Slipknot&quot;, &quot;Gently&quot;, &quot;Do Nothing/Bitchslap&quot;, &quot;Tattered and Torn&quot;, &quot;Heartache and a Pair of Scissors&quot;, &quot;Me Inside&quot;, &quot;Coleslaw&quot;, &quot;Carve&quot;, &quot;Windows&quot;, and &quot;May 17&quot;. In 1998, Slipknot was receiving growing attention from record labels, including Epic and Hollywood Records.

On September 29, 1998, Slipknot left Des Moines, Iowa, and relocated at Indigo Ranch Studios in Malibu, California, anxious to record an album after a long wait to be signed. During that time, its members attended a show by avant-garde metal supergroup Fantômas, fronted by Mike Patton (whom the band already admired from his work with Mr. Bungle and Faith No More). Fantômas went on to greatly influence Slipknot&#x27;s new music. After recording a new demo, Slipknot released it to prospective labels and producers; the track &quot;Spit It Out&quot; was the main focus in it and, with help from their manager Sophia John, they were able to supply a copy of the eponymous demo to Ross Robinson. The band wanted him to work with them on their debut album, and, after meeting with the band, Robinson signed them to his own label, I Am, but later helped sign them to Roadrunner Records.

The album&#x27;s recording process was &quot;very aggressive and chaotic&quot;, as producer Robinson strove to capture the intensity that the band created when performing live. Within three days all the drums were recorded, which contributed to the raw, live sound on the album that the band considered integral to its musical direction. Robinson played a big part in the stylistic change of the band, convincing them to cut off the more experimental sections and guitar solos in favor of a straightforward metal sound. By November 11, 1998, the recording of the album seemed complete and the band returned to Des Moines. During the Christmas period, guitarist Josh Brainard, who recorded on all the tracks to that point, left the band. The reasons for his departure were unclear; it was widely thought to have been because of family constraints. However, Brainard dispelled these rumours, explaining that &quot;some decisions were made that I wasn&#x27;t particularly happy with.&quot; His replacement was Jim Root, with whom the band returned to the studio in February 1999. Slipknot finished recording during this period, with one new track called &quot;Purity&quot;. The mixing stages turned out to be very challenging, as drummer Joey Jordison and producer Robinson mixed the entire album with analog equipment, instead of the then more common method of using digital formats. &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; and &quot;Spit It Out&quot;, which also appeared on the demo prior to the album, were released on the album, also; the demo songs &quot;Interloper&quot; and &quot;Despise&quot; are available on the digipak version of the same album.

==Musical and lyrical themes==
Slipknot&#x27;s musical style is constantly contested; the genres in which the band are categorized vary depending on the source. However, this album is regarded as nu metal, while showing influences of other genres. Joey Jordison stated, &quot;The roots are death metal, thrash metal, speed metal, and I could go on and on about all those bands.&quot; The album also shows influences from alternative metal and even rap metal. Critics have also noted an industrial influence.

The band&#x27;s use of percussion, turntables, and samples gave the album a dense, layered sound. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; hailed the &quot;inventive sampling, creative guitar work and an absolute percussive overload&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot; described the album as &quot;a terrifying racket&quot;. &quot;Slipknot&quot; also includes melody, notably in the single &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot;.

&quot;742617000027&quot;, the intro, named after the barcode of &quot;Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.&quot;, contains guitar scratches and abstract sound samples by sampler Craig Jones. Some of the dialogue was taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is, &quot;The whole thing, I think it&#x27;s sick.&quot; In an interview shortly after the album was released, Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor&#x27;s, sped up. &quot;(sic)&quot;, recalled Jordison, was written &quot;at the very first rehearsal I had with Slipknot, on September 15, 1995. We were called The Pale Ones then and the song was originally called &quot;Slipknot&quot;. It sounded completely different as Corey wasn&#x27;t in the picture at that point.&quot; (Corey Taylor appeared on Slipknot&#x27;s second demo, which resulted in them signing to Roadrunner Records.) &quot;Paul &quot;[Gray, bassist]&quot; and I wrote the song together many years before we started Slipknot,&quot; said Shawn Crahan. &quot;We basically had the riff and the drum beat. But it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;(sic)&#x27; until everyone else was in the band and we brought it to &quot;[producer]&quot; Ross &quot;[Robinson]&quot;.&quot; &quot;All of us were in the same room when we recorded this. It was hilarious. Everyone had their headphones tied to their head so we could all slam and go crazy while we played. Ross was throwing potted plants at Joey. It was the most insane thing I&#x27;d ever seen.&quot;

Out of all the tracks on the album, the song &quot;Diluted&quot; is the only one to have never been performed live. Rick Anderson of AllMusic noted that on &quot;Scissors&quot;, Taylor &quot;sounds like he&#x27;s about to burst into tears.&quot; Taylor&#x27;s aggressive, expletive-filled lyrics were noted by AllMusic: &quot;[the] lyrics that are discernible are not generally quotable on a family website; suffice it to say that the members of Slipknot are not impressed with their fathers, their hometown or most anything else.&quot;

&quot;Eeyore&quot; – a hidden track at the end of &quot;Scissors&quot; – begins after dialogue shared among the band members, recorded while they were viewing a scene in a pornographic film that involved coprophilia. It has been played live many times and appears on the DVD &quot;Disasterpieces&quot; and the live album &quot;9.0: Live&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Slipknot&quot; received acclaim by critics and fans; following its release the band gained popularity beyond their own expectations. Reviewing for AllMusic, Rick Anderson called it &quot;an auspicious debut&quot; and proclaimed, &quot;You thought Limp Bizkit was hard? They&#x27;re The Osmonds. These guys are something else entirely. And it&#x27;s pretty impressive.&quot; The album&#x27;s aggression and heavy sound was widely praised; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated &quot;Slipknot&quot; is &quot;metal with a capital &quot;m&quot;&quot; and that they were &quot;the first death metal jam band&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; called the album &quot;raw and wholly uncompromising, each track delivered a powerful blow to the senses&quot;, and in 2001, &quot;Q&quot; included the album in their list &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time&quot;. CMJ ranked the album as the twelfth highest &quot;Editorial Pick&quot; for 1999. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; by Robert Dimery. Jon Hotten of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; described Slipknot&#x27;s &quot;scary, genre-busting debut&quot; as a &quot;clever synthesis of a slasher movie aesthetics with some grindingly heavy metal&quot; and judged the band as apparently not &quot;built to endure&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;Slipknot&quot; ranked at number 247 in &quot;Q&quot;″s readers poll of the &quot;250 Best Albums of the Last 25 Years&quot;. In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
A single from the album, &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot;, was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards, but lost to Deftones&#x27; &quot;Elite&quot;. The song was also named the 36th greatest metal song of all time by VH1. The release of the album and the touring which followed greatly increased the band&#x27;s popularity. The album became the &quot;biggest selling extreme metal album&quot; at the time. It was ranked by American SoundScan as the fastest-selling metal debut in SoundScan&#x27;s history. On May 2, 2000, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), a first for any album released by Roadrunner Records. On February 5, 2005, Slipknot&#x27;s self-titled album was certified double platinum by the RIAA. In Canada, the album was certified 2× Platinum by Music Canada on May 21, 2024. The British Phonographic Industry certified Slipknot&#x27;s self-titled album as platinum on October 17, 2008, in the UK.

==Controversy==
After the album&#x27;s release, the band had to remove two tracks after allegations of copyright infringement. &quot;Purity&quot; and &quot;Frail Limb Nursery&quot; were inspired by a story, published online, about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called &quot;Crime Scene&quot;, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website included no disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many readers believed the story to be true, including Corey Taylor: &quot;I still think the story&#x27;s real. It fucked our whole world up when we read it. Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? It just hurts your head.&quot;

&#x27;Purity&#x27;, said Taylor, &quot;was originally called &#x27;Despise&#x27; but it didn&#x27;t work when we tried to put it together… Ross &quot;[Robinson]&quot; took it and helped us restructure it.&quot; In a Q&amp;A, Taylor claimed the lyrics had been written five years prior to the song&#x27;s release, that only the name had been inspired by the Purity Knight story and that inspiration came from films such as &quot;Boxing Helena&quot; and &quot;The Collector&quot;, and not the story.

However, Slipknot, to prevent the entire album being pulled, removed &quot;Purity&quot; and &quot;Frail Limb Nursery&quot;. Slightly remastered standard and digipak versions of the album were issued in December 1999, replacing both tracks with &quot;Me Inside&quot;. Although &quot;Frail Limb Nursery&quot; was never rereleased, &quot;Purity&quot; was included on the DVD &quot;Disasterpieces&quot;, the live &quot;9.0: Live,&quot; the &#x27;best of&#x27; &quot;Antennas to Hell&quot;, and the 10th anniversary edition of &quot;Slipknot&quot;.

==10th Anniversary edition==
On September 9, 2009, Slipknot released a special edition version of the album to commemorate the tenth anniversary of its release. It was released in two forms, a digipak and a box set. The release date (09/09/09) is a reference to the fact that the band had nine members and had at that point sustained the same lineup since the original release of the album. The special edition box set includes: a CD and DVD set featuring all new digipak packaging, with a total of 25 songs including the original album with &quot;Purity&quot; (minus the prelude &quot;Frail Limb Nursery&quot;) plus several previously unreleased cuts and demo tracks. The DVD, which was directed by percussionist Shawn Crahan, features footage of the band in 1999 and 2000, titled &quot;Of the Sic: Your Nightmares, Our Dreams&quot;. The DVD also features all three music videos released in support of the album, an entire live concert recorded at the Dynamo Open Air, 2000 and &quot;other surprises&quot;. A &quot;super deluxe&quot; box set version of the re-release contains a T-shirt, patch, collectible cards, key chain, beanie and a note from vocalist Corey Taylor, and comes in packaging that resembles a safety deposit box.

<text>Bleda () was a Hunnic ruler, the brother of Attila the Hun.

As nephews to Rugila, Attila and his elder brother Bleda succeeded him to the throne. Bleda&#x27;s reign lasted for eleven years until his death. While it has been speculated by Jordanes that Attila murdered him on a hunting trip, it is unknown exactly how he died. One of the few things known about Bleda is that, after the great Hun campaign of 441, he acquired a Moorish dwarf named Zerco. Bleda was highly amused by Zerco and went so far as to make a suit of armor for the dwarf so that Zerco could accompany him on campaign.

==Etymology==
Greek sources have &quot;Βλήδας&quot; and &quot;Βλέδας&quot; (Bledas), Chronicon Paschale &quot;Βλίδας&quot; (Blidas), and Latin &quot;Bleda&quot;.

Otto Maenchen-Helfen considered the name to be of Germanic or Germanized origin, a short form of &quot;Bladardus&quot;, &quot;Blatgildus&quot;, &quot;Blatgisus&quot;. Denis Sinor considered that the name begins with consonant cluster, and as such it cannot be of Altaic origin. In 455 is recorded the Arian bishop Bleda along Genseric and the Vandals, and one of Totila generals also had the same name.

Omeljan Pritsak considered its root &quot;bli-&quot; had typical vocalic metathesis of Oghur-Bulgar language from &lt; &quot;*bil-&quot;, which is Old Turkic &quot;to know&quot;. Thus Hunnic &quot;*bildä&quot; &gt; &quot;blidä&quot; was actually Old Turkic &quot;bilgä&quot; (wise, sovereign).

==Bleda and Attila&#x27;s rule==

By 432, the Huns were united under Rugila. His death in 434 left his nephews Attila and Bleda (the sons of his brother Mundzuk) in control over all the united Hun tribes. At the time of their accession, the Huns were bargaining with Byzantine emperor Theodosius II&#x27;s envoys over the return of several renegade tribes who had taken refuge within the Roman Empire. The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at Margus (present-day Požarevac) and, all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner, negotiated a successful treaty: the Romans agreed not only to return the fugitive tribes (who had been a welcome aid against the Vandals), but also to double their previous tribute of 350 Roman pounds (ca. 114.5 kg) of gold, open their markets to Hunnish traders, and pay a ransom of eight &quot;solidi&quot; for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the empire and returned to their home, perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the walls of Constantinople, building the city&#x27;s first sea wall, and to build up his border defenses along the Danube.
For the next five years, the Huns stayed out of Roman sight as they tried to invade the Persian Empire. A crushing defeat in Armenia caused them to abandon this attempt and return their attentions to Europe. In 440, they reappeared on the borders of the Roman Empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been established by the treaty. Attila and Bleda threatened further war, claiming that the Romans had failed to fulfill their treaty obligations and that the Bishop of Margus had crossed the Danube to ransack and desecrate the royal Hun graves on the Danube&#x27;s north bank. They crossed the Danube and laid waste to Illyrian cities and forts on the river, among them, according to Priscus, Viminacium (present-day Kostolac), which was a city of the Moesians in Illyria. Their advance began at Margus, for when the Romans discussed handing over the offending bishop, he slipped away secretly to the Huns and betrayed the city to them.

Theodosius had stripped the river&#x27;s defenses in response to the Vandal Gaiseric&#x27;s capture of Carthage in 440 and the Sassanid Yazdegerd II&#x27;s invasion of Armenia in 441. This left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyria into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army, having sacked Margus and Viminacium, took Singidunum (modern Belgrade) and Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica) before halting. A lull followed in 442, and, during this time, Theodosius recalled his troops from North Africa and ordered a large new issue of coins to finance operations against the Huns. Having made these preparations, he thought it safe to refuse the Hunnish kings&#x27; demands.

Attila and Bleda responded by renewing their campaign in 443. Striking along the Danube, they overran the military centers of Ratiaria and successfully besieged Naissus (modern Niš) with battering rams and other siege engines (military sophistication that was new to the Hun repertory), then, pushing along the Nišava, they took Serdica (Sofia), Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and Arcadiopolis (Luleburgaz). They encountered and destroyed the Roman force outside Constantinople and were only halted by their lack of siege equipment capable of breaching the city&#x27;s massive walls. Theodosius admitted defeat and sent the court official Anatolius to negotiate peace terms, which were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (ca. 1,963 kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (ca. 687 kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to twelve &quot;solidi.&quot;

Their demands met for a time, the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire. According to Jordanes (following Priscus), sometime during the peace following the Huns&#x27; withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around 445), Bleda died (killed by his brother, according to the classical sources), and Attila took the throne for himself. A few sources indicate that Bleda tried to kill Attila first, to which Attila retaliated.

In 448, Priscus encountered Bleda&#x27;s widow, then governor of an unnamed village, while on an embassy to Attila&#x27;s court.
==Legacy==
Bleda is known by Hungarian literature as Buda. According to medieval sources, Buda the name of the historic capital of the Kingdom of Hungary derived from the name of its founder, Bleda, brother of Hunnic ruler Attila. The name of the capital city of Hungary, Budapest also comes from his name.

== Portrayals ==

* Ettore Manni portrayed Bleda in the 1954 Anthony Quinn film.
* Leo Gordon was Bleda in Sign of the Pagan, released the same year.

* Scottish actor Tommy Flanagan played Bleda in the 2001 mini-series, opposite Gerard Butler, as Attila.
