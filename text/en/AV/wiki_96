<text>Islamic philosophy is philosophy that emerges from the Islamic tradition. Two terms traditionally used in the Islamic world are sometimes translated as philosophy—&quot;falsafa&quot; (), which refers to philosophy as well as logic, mathematics, and physics; and &quot;kalam&quot; (), which refers to a rationalist form of Scholastic Islamic theology which includes the schools of Maturidiyah, Ashaira and Mu&#x27;tazila.

Early Islamic philosophy began with al-Kindi in the 2nd century of the Islamic calendar (early 9th century CE) and ended with Ibn Rushd (Averroes) in the 6th century AH (late 12th century CE), broadly coinciding with the period known as the Golden Age of Islam. The death of Averroes effectively marked the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the Islamic peripatetic school, and philosophical activity declined significantly in the west of the Islamic world, including al-Andalus and the Maghreb.

Islamic philosophy persisted for much longer in the east of the Islamic world, particularly in Safavid Iran, the Ottoman Empire, and the Mughal Empire, where several schools of philosophy continued to flourish: Avicennism, Averroism, Illuminationism, mystical philosophy, transcendent theosophy, and the school of Isfahan. Ibn Khaldun, in his Muqaddimah, made important contributions to the philosophy of history. Interest in Islamic philosophy revived during the Nahda (&quot;Awakening&quot;) movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and continues to the present day.

Islamic philosophy had a major impact in Christian Europe, where translation of Arabic philosophical texts into Latin &quot;led to the transformation of almost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval Latin world&quot;, with a particularly strong influence of Muslim philosophers being felt in natural philosophy, psychology and metaphysics.

== Introduction ==
Islamic philosophy refers to philosophy produced in an Islamic society. As it is not necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor exclusively produced by Muslims, many scholars prefer the term &quot;Arabic philosophy.&quot;

Islamic philosophy is a generic term that can be defined and used in different ways. In its broadest sense it means the world view of Islam, as derived from the Islamic texts concerning the creation of the universe and the will of the Creator. In another sense it refers to any of the schools of thought that flourished under the Islamic empire or in the shadow of the Arab-Islamic culture and Islamic civilization. In its narrowest sense it is a translation of &quot;Falsafa&quot;, meaning those particular schools of thought that most reflect the influence of Greek systems of philosophy such as Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism.

Some schools of thought within Islam deny the usefulness or legitimacy of philosophical inquiry. Some argue that there is no indication that the limited knowledge and experience of humans can lead to truth. It is also important to observe that, while &quot;reason&quot; (&quot;&#x27;aql&quot;) is sometimes recognised as a source of Islamic law, it has been claimed that this has a totally different meaning from &quot;reason&quot; in philosophy.
The historiography of Islamic philosophy is marked by disputes as to how the subject should be properly interpreted. Some of the key issues involve the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and of western thinkers such as Ibn Rushd, and also whether Islamic philosophy can be read at face value or should be interpreted in an esoteric fashion. Supporters of the latter thesis, like Leo Strauss, maintain that Islamic philosophers wrote so as to conceal their true meaning in order to avoid religious persecution, but scholars such as Oliver Leaman disagree.

== Formative influences ==
The main sources of classical or early Islamic philosophy are the religion of Islam itself (especially ideas derived and interpreted from the Quran) and Greek philosophy which the early Muslims inherited as a result of conquests, along with pre-Islamic Indian philosophy and Persian philosophy. Many of the early philosophical debates centered around reconciling religion and reason, the latter exemplified by Greek philosophy.

== Early Islamic philosophy ==

In early Islamic thought, which refers to philosophy during the &quot;Islamic Golden Age&quot;, traditionally dated between the 8th and 12th centuries, two main currents may be distinguished. The first is Kalam, which mainly dealt with Islamic theological questions, and the other is Falsafa, which was founded on interpretations of Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism. There were attempts by later philosopher-theologians at harmonizing both trends, notably by Ibn Sina (Avicenna) who founded the school of Avicennism, Ibn Rushd (Averroes) who founded the school of Averroism, and others such as Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī.

===&quot;Kalam&quot;===

&quot;ʿIlm al-Kalām&quot; () is the philosophy that seeks Islamic theological principles through dialectic. In Arabic, the word literally means &quot;speech&quot;.

One of the first debates was that between partisans of the &quot;Qadar&quot; ( meaning &quot;Fate&quot;), who affirmed free will; and the &quot;Jabarites&quot; ( meaning &quot;force&quot;, &quot;constraint&quot;), who believed in fatalism.

At the 2nd century of the Hijra, a new movement arose in the theological school of Basra, Iraq. A pupil of Hasan of Basra, Wasil ibn Ata, left the group when he disagreed with his teacher on whether a Muslim who has committed a major sin invalidates his faith. He systematized the radical opinions of preceding sects, particularly those of the Qadarites and Jabarites. This new school was called &quot;Mu&#x27;tazilite&quot; (from &quot;i&#x27;tazala&quot;, to separate oneself).

The Mu&#x27;tazilites looked in towards a strict rationalism with which to interpret Islamic doctrine. Their attempt was one of the first to pursue a rational theology in Islam. They were however severely criticized by other Islamic philosophers, both Maturidis and Asharites. The great Asharite scholar Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi wrote the work &quot;Al-Mutakallimin fi &#x27;Ilm al-Kalam&quot; against the Mutazalites.

In later times, &quot;Kalam&quot; was used to mean simply &quot;theology&quot;, i.e. the &quot;duties of the heart&quot; as opposed to (or in conjunction with) &quot;fiqh&quot; (jurisprudence), the &quot;duties of the body&quot;.

===&quot;Falsafa&quot;===
&quot;Falsafa&quot; is a Greek loanword meaning &quot;philosophy&quot; (the Greek pronunciation &quot;philosophia&quot; became &quot;falsafa&quot;). From the 9th century onward, due to Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun and his successor, ancient Greek philosophy was introduced among the Arabs and the Peripatetic School began to find able representatives. Among them were Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna and Averroes. Another trend, represented by the Brethren of Purity, used Aristotelian language to expound a fundamentally Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean world view.

During the Abbasid caliphate, a number of thinkers and scientists, some of them heterodox Muslims or non-Muslims, played a role in transmitting Greek, Hindu and other pre-Islamic knowledge to the Christian West. Three speculative thinkers, Al-Farabi, Avicenna and Al-Kindi, combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam.

Ahmad Sirhindi, 17th century Indian Islamic scholar, has viewed that the Greek philosophy about creations are incompatible with Islamic teaching by quoting several chapters of Quran. Furthermore, Sirhindi criticize the method of interpretating the meaning of Quran with philosophy.

===End of the classical period===
By the 12th century, &quot;Kalam&quot;, attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox, perished for lack of champions. At the same time, however, &quot;Falsafa&quot; came under serious critical scrutiny. The most devastating attack came from Al-Ghazali, whose work &quot;Tahafut al-Falasifa&quot; (&quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;) attacked the main arguments of the Peripatetic School.

Averroes, Maimonides&#x27; contemporary, was one of the last of the Islamic Peripatetics and set out to defend the views of the &quot;Falsafa&quot; against al-Ghazali&#x27;s criticism. The theories of Ibn Rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail, who only follow the teachings of Avicenna and Al-Farabi. Like all Islamic Peripatetics, Averroes admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world—hypotheses which, in the mind of the Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle&#x27;s doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter.

But while Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and other Persian and Muslim philosophers hurried, so to speak, over subjects that trenched on traditional beliefs, Ibn Rushd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress. Thus he says, &quot;Not only is matter eternal, but form is potentially inherent in matter; otherwise, it were a creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot;&quot; (Munk, &quot;Mélanges,&quot; p. 444). According to this theory, therefore, the existence of this world is not only a possibility, as Avicenna declared, but also a necessity.

== Logic ==
In early Islamic philosophy, logic played an important role. Sharia (Islamic law) placed importance on formulating standards of argument, which gave rise to a novel approach to logic in Kalam, but this approach was later displaced by ideas from Greek philosophy and Hellenistic philosophy with the rise of the Mu&#x27;tazili philosophers, who highly valued Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Organon&quot;. The works of Hellenistic-influenced Islamic philosophers were crucial in the reception of Aristotelian logic in medieval Europe, along with the commentaries on the &quot;Organon&quot; by Averroes. The works of al-Farabi, Avicenna, al-Ghazali and other Muslim logicians who often criticized and corrected Aristotelian logic and introduced their own forms of logic, also played a central role in the subsequent development of European logic during the Renaissance.

According to the &quot;Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;:

Important developments made by Muslim logicians included the development of &quot;Avicennian logic&quot; as a replacement of Aristotelian logic. Avicenna&#x27;s system of logic was responsible for the introduction of hypothetical syllogism, temporal modal logic and inductive logic. Other important developments in early Islamic philosophy include the development of a strict science of citation, the isnad or &quot;backing&quot;, and the development of a method to disprove claims, the ijtihad, which was generally applied to many types of questions.

===Logic in Islamic law and theology===
Early forms of analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning and categorical syllogism were introduced in Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century with the process of &quot;Qiyas&quot;, before the Arabic translations of Aristotle&#x27;s works. Later, during the Islamic Golden Age, there was debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term &quot;Qiyas&quot; refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that &quot;Qiyas&quot; refers to inductive reasoning. Ibn Hazm (994–1064) disagreed, arguing that &quot;Qiyas&quot; does not refer to inductive reasoning but to categorical syllogistic reasoning in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111; and, in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that &quot;Qiyas&quot; refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term &quot;Qiyas&quot; refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.

===Aristotelian logic===
The first original Arabic writings on logic were produced by al-Kindi (Alkindus) (805–873), who produced a summary on earlier logic up to his time. The first writings on logic with non-Aristotelian elements was produced by al-Farabi (Alfarabi) (873–950), who discussed the topics of future contingents, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between logic and grammar, and non-Aristotelian forms of inference. He is also credited for categorizing logic into two separate groups, the first being &quot;idea&quot; and the second being &quot;proof&quot;.

Averroes (1126–1198), author of the most elaborate commentaries on Aristotelian logic, was the last major logician from al-Andalus.

===Avicennian logic===
Avicenna (980–1037) developed his own system of logic known as &quot;Avicennian logic&quot; as an alternative to Aristotelian logic. By the 12th century, Avicennian logic had replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world.

The first criticisms of Aristotelian logic were written by Avicenna (980–1037), who produced independent treatises on logic rather than commentaries. He criticized the logical school of Baghdad for their devotion to Aristotle at the time. He investigated the theory of definition and classification and the quantification of the predicates of categorical propositions, and developed an original theory on &quot;temporal modal&quot; syllogism. Its premises included modifiers such as &quot;at all times&quot;, &quot;at most times&quot;, and &quot;at some time&quot;.

While Avicenna (980–1037) often relied on deductive reasoning in philosophy, he used a different approach in medicine. Ibn Sina contributed inventively to the development of inductive logic, which he used to pioneer the idea of a syndrome. In his medical writings, Avicenna was the first to describe the methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation which are critical to inductive logic and the scientific method.

Ibn Hazm (994–1064) wrote the &quot;Scope of Logic&quot;, in which he stressed on the importance of sense perception as a source of knowledge. Al-Ghazali (Algazel) (1058–1111) had an important influence on the use of logic in theology, making use of Avicennian logic in Kalam.

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;first figure&quot; and developed a form of inductive logic, foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). Systematic refutations of Greek logic were written by the Illuminationist school, founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1155–1191), who developed the idea of &quot;decisive necessity&quot;, an important innovation in the history of logical philosophical speculation, and in favour of inductive reasoning.

== Metaphysics ==

===Cosmological and ontological arguments===

Avicenna&#x27;s proof for the existence of God was the first ontological argument, which he proposed in the &quot;Metaphysics&quot; section of &quot;The Book of Healing&quot;. This was the first attempt at using the method of a priori proof, which utilizes intuition and reason alone. Avicenna&#x27;s proof of God&#x27;s existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a cosmological argument and an ontological argument. &quot;It is ontological insofar as ‘necessary existence’ in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a Necessary Existent&quot;. The proof is also &quot;cosmological insofar as most of it is taken up with arguing that contingent existents cannot stand alone and must end up in a Necessary Existent.&quot;

===Essence and existence===
Theologians, particularly among the Muʿtazilites, agreed with Aristotelian metaphysics that non-existence is a thing (&quot;s̲h̲ayʾ&quot;) and an entity (&quot;d̲h̲āt&quot;). According to Aristotelian philosophy, non-existence has to be distinguished by absolute non-existence, that is absolute nothingness, and relative non-existence. The latter can refer to the absence of a quality or the potentiality of something. Muʿtazilite thinkers such as al-Fārābī and ibn Sīnā hold the position that things had a relative existence prior to creation. God knew what he was going to create and God gave them the accident of existence. Contrarily, Asharites regard existence as essence.

Islamic philosophy, imbued as it is with Islamic theology, distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism the difference between essence and existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. This was first described by Avicenna&#x27;s works on metaphysics, who was himself influenced by al-Farabi.

Some orientalists (or those particularly influenced by Thomist scholarship) argued that Avicenna was the first to view existence (&quot;wujud&quot;) as an accident that happens to the essence (&quot;mahiyya&quot;). However, this aspect of ontology is not the most central to the distinction that Avicenna established between essence and existence. One cannot therefore make the claim that Avicenna was the proponent of the concept of essentialism &quot;per se&quot;, given that existence (&quot;al-wujud&quot;) when thought of in terms of necessity would ontologically translate into a notion of the &quot;Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself&quot; (&quot;wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi&quot;), which is without description or definition and, in particular, without quiddity or essence (&quot;la mahiyya lahu&quot;). Consequently, Avicenna&#x27;s ontology is &#x27;existentialist&#x27; when accounting for being–&quot;&quot;–existence in terms of necessity (&quot;wujub&quot;), while it is essentialist in terms of thinking about being–&quot;qua&quot;–existence in terms of &quot;contingency–&quot;qua&quot;–possibility&quot; (&quot;imkan&quot; or &quot;mumkin al-wujud&quot;, meaning &quot;contingent being&quot;).

Some argue that Avicenna anticipated Frege and Bertrand Russell in &quot;holding that existence is an accident of accidents&quot; and also anticipated Alexius Meinong&#x27;s &quot;view about nonexistent objects.&quot; He also provided early arguments for &quot;a &quot;necessary being&quot; as cause of all other existents.&quot;

The idea of &quot;essence preced[ing] existence&quot; is a concept which dates back to Avicenna and his school as well as Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi and his Illuminationist philosophy. &quot;Existence preced[ing] essence&quot;, the opposite (existentialist) notion, was developed in the works of Averroes and Mulla Sadra&#x27;s transcendent theosophy.
===Resurrection===
Ibn al-Nafis wrote the &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot; as a defense of &quot;the system of Islam and the Muslims&#x27; doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world.&quot; The book presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality of the human soul, using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus as forms of evidence. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to Avicenna&#x27;s metaphysical argument on spiritual resurrection (as opposed to bodily resurrection), which was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali.

===Soul and spirit===
The Muslim physician-philosophers, Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis, developed their own theories on the soul. They both made a distinction between the soul and the spirit, and in particular, the Avicennian doctrine on the nature of the soul was influential among the Scholastics. Some of Avicenna&#x27;s views on the soul included the idea that the immortality of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill. In his theory of &quot;The Ten Intellects&quot;, he viewed the human soul as the tenth and final intellect.

Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis (Ibn al-Nafis), Islamic philosophers and physicians who followed Aristotle, put forward a different theory about the soul than Aristotle&#x27;s, and made a distinction between soul (In. spirit) and soul (In. soul). [32] Especially Avicenna&#x27;s teaching on the nature of the soul had a great influence on the Scholastics. According to Ibn Sina, the soul is a spiritual substance separate from the body, it uses the body as a tool. The famous example given by Ibn Sina to show that the soul is a spiritual substance separate from the material body and to show one&#x27;s self-awareness, is known as &quot;insan-i tair&quot; (flying person) and was used throughout the West in the Middle Ages. In this example, he asks his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the sky (in the air), without any sensory contact, isolated from all sensations: The person in this state is still realizing himself even though there is no material contact. In that case, the idea that the soul (person) is dependent on matter, that is, any physical object, does not make sense, and the soul is a substance on its own. (Here, the concept of “I exist even though I am not in the dense-rough matter of the world” is treated.) This &quot;proving by reflection&quot; study by Ibn Sina was later simplified by René Descartes and expressed in epistemological terms as follows: “I can isolate myself from all supposed things outside of me. , but I can never (abstract) from my own consciousness.”. According to Ibn Sina, immortality of the soul is not a goal, but a necessity and consequence of its nature.

Avicenna generally supported Aristotle&#x27;s idea of the soul originating from the heart, whereas Ibn al-Nafis on the other hand rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul &quot;is related to the entirety and not to one or a few organs.&quot; He further criticized Aristotle&#x27;s idea that every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. Ibn al-Nafis concluded that &quot;the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul&quot; and he defined the soul as nothing other than &quot;what a human indicates by saying ‘I’.&quot;

===Thought experiments===

While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his &quot;Floating Man&quot; thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality of the soul. He referred to the living human intelligence, particularly the active intellect, which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. His &quot;Floating Man&quot; thought experiment tells its readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all , which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argues that, in this scenario, one would still have self-consciousness. He thus concludes that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing, and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms, but as a primary given, a substance.

This argument was later refined and simplified by René Descartes in epistemic terms when he stated: &quot;I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness.&quot;

===Time===
While ancient Greek philosophers believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, early medieval philosophers and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the creationism shared by Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher John Philoponus presented a detailed argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. Muslim and Arab Jewish philosophers like Al-Kindi, Saadia Gaon, and Al-Ghazali developed further arguments, with most falling into two broad categories: assertions of the &quot;impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite&quot; and of the &quot;impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition&quot;.

===Truth===
In metaphysics, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) defined truth as:

Avicenna elaborated on his definition of truth in his &quot;Metaphysics&quot;:

In his &quot;Quodlibeta&quot;, Thomas Aquinas wrote a commentary on Avicenna&#x27;s definition of truth in his &quot;Metaphysics&quot; and explained it as follows:

Early Islamic political philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion and the process of ijtihad to find truth.

Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself. In his &quot;Aporias against Ptolemy&quot;, Ibn al-Haytham further wrote the following comments on truth:



=== Free will and predestination ===

The issue of free will versus predestination is one of the &quot;most contentious topics in classical Islamic thought.&quot; In accordance with the Islamic belief in predestination, or divine preordainment (&quot;al-qadā wa&#x27;l-qadar&quot;), God has full knowledge and control over all that occurs. This is explained in Qur&#x27;anic verses such as &quot;Say: &#x27;Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector&#x27;...&quot; For Muslims, everything in the world that occurs, good or bad, has been preordained and nothing can happen unless permitted by God. According to Islamic tradition, all that has been decreed by God is written in &quot;al-Lawh al-Mahfūz&quot;, the &quot;Preserved Tablet&quot;.

== Natural philosophy ==
===Atomism===

Atomistic philosophies are found very early in Islamic philosophy, and represent a synthesis of the Greek and Indian ideas. Like both the Greek and Indian versions, Islamic atomism was a charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious orthodoxy. Yet it was such a fertile and flexible idea that, as in Greece and India, it flourished in some schools of Islamic thought.

The most successful form of Islamic atomism was in the Asharite school of philosophy, most notably in the work of the philosopher al-Ghazali (1058–1111). In Asharite atomism, atoms are the only perpetual, material things in existence, and all else in the world is &quot;accidental&quot; meaning something that lasts for only an instant. Nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else, except perception, as it exists for a moment. Contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes, but are the direct result of God&#x27;s constant intervention, without which nothing could happen. Thus nature is completely dependent on God, which meshes with other Asharite Islamic ideas on causation, or the lack thereof.

Other traditions in Islam rejected the atomism of the Asharites and expounded on many Greek texts, especially those of Aristotle. An active school of philosophers in Spain, including the noted commentator Averroes (1126-1198 AD) explicitly rejected the thought of al-Ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of Aristotle. Averroes commented in detail on most of the works of Aristotle and his commentaries did much to guide the interpretation of Aristotle in later Jewish and Christian scholastic thought.

===Cosmology===

There are several cosmological verses in the Qur&#x27;an which some modern writers have interpreted as foreshadowing the expansion of the universe and possibly even the Big Bang theory:


In contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, medieval philosophers and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the creation myth shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the first such argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. His reasoning was adopted by many, most notably; Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel). They used two logical arguments against an infinite past, the first being the &quot;argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite&quot;, which states:

:&quot;An actual infinite cannot exist.&quot;
:&quot;An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite.&quot;
:&quot;.•. An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist.&quot;

The second argument, the &quot;argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition&quot;, states:

:&quot;An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition.&quot;
:&quot;The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition.&quot;
:&quot;.•. The temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite.&quot;

Both arguments were adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians, and the second argument in particular became famous after it was adopted by Immanuel Kant in his thesis of the first antimony concerning time.

In the 10th century, the Brethren of Purity published the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot;, in which a heliocentric view of the universe is expressed in a section on cosmology:

Cosmological ideas maintained by scholars such as al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, have strong resemblance with the Neo-Platonistic emanation cosmology. They identified the different Intellects, dividing the cosmos into different spheres, as similar to the Islamic angels. However, Islamic scholars repeatedly insist that all heavenly spheres as a whole form a single body and are moved by God, in contrast to Aristotelian cosmology in which God only moves the outer sphere. According to ibn Sina, but differing from al-Farabi, God is not part of the scheme of emanation. God emanated things in accordance with his will. In his &quot;Theologia Aristotelis&quot; he shows that through the manifestation of God, the intellects are aware of God and their role in the universe. Further Ibn Sina seems to distinguishes between two types of angels: One completely unrelated to matter, and another one, which exists in form of a superior kind of matter. The latter ones can carry messages between the heavenly spheres and the sublunary world, appearing in visions. Therefore, the higher angels dwell in higher spheres, while their subordinate angels appear in an intermediary realm. Ibn Sina&#x27;s explanation might imply an attempt to consider revelation as part of the natural world. Also Qazwini lists a lower type of angels; earthly angels as indwelling forces of nature, who keep the world in order and never deviate from their duty. Qazwini believed that the existence of these angels could be proved by reason and effects of these angels on their assigned object.

===Evolution===

====Struggle for existence====
The Mu&#x27;tazili scientist and philosopher al-Jahiz (c. 776–869) was the only known medieval Arab philosopher to write on topics related to natural selection. Al-Jahiz&#x27;s ideas on the struggle for existence in the &quot;Book of Animals&quot; have been summarized as follows:

However, according to Frank Edgerton (2002), the claim made by some authors that al-Jahiz was an early evolutionist is &quot;unconvincing&quot;, but the narrower claim that Jahiz &quot;recognized the effect of environmental factors on animal life&quot; seems valid. Rebecca Stott (2013) writes of al-Jahiz&#x27;s work:

Jahiz was not concerned with argument or theorizing. He was concerned with witnessing;...Jahiz was not trying to work out how the world began or how species had come to be. He believed that God had done the making and that he had done it brilliantly...He also understood what we might call the survival of the fittest.

In Chapter 47 of &quot;India&quot;, entitled &quot;On Vasudeva and the Wars of the Bharata,&quot; Abu Rayhan Biruni attempted to give a naturalistic explanation as to why the struggles described in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; &quot;had to take place.&quot; He explains it using natural processes that include biological ideas related to evolution, which has led several scholars to compare his ideas to Darwinism and natural selection. This is due to Biruni describing the idea of artificial selection and then applying it to nature:

In the 13th century, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi explains how the elements evolved into minerals, then plants, then animals, and then humans. Tusi then goes on to explain how hereditary variability was an important factor for biological evolution of living things:

Tusi discusses how organisms are able to adapt to their environments:

====Transmutation of species====
Al-Dinawari (828–896), considered the founder of Arabic botany for his &quot;Book of Plants&quot;, discussed plant evolution from its birth to its death, describing the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit.

Ibn Miskawayh&#x27;s &quot;al-Fawz al-Asghar&quot; and the Brethren of Purity&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot; (&quot;The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa&quot;) developed theories on evolution that possibly had an influence on Charles Darwin and his inception of Darwinism, but has at one time been criticized as overenthusiastic.

English translations of the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot; were available from 1812, while Arabic manuscripts of the &quot;al-Fawz al-Asghar&quot; and &quot;The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa&quot; were also available at the University of Cambridge by the 19th century. These works likely had an influence on 19th-century evolutionists, and possibly Charles Darwin.

In the 14th century, Ibn Khaldun further developed the evolutionary ideas found in the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot;. The following statements from his 1377 work, the &quot;Muqaddimah&quot;, express evolutionary ideas:

Numerous other Islamic scholars and scientists, including the polymaths Ibn al-Haytham and Al-Khazini, discussed and developed these ideas. Translated into Latin, these works began to appear in the West after the Renaissance and may have influenced Western philosophy and science.

===Phenomenology of Vision===

The polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) is considered a pioneer of phenomenology. He articulated a relationship between the physical and observable world and that of intuition, psychology and mental functions. His theories regarding knowledge and perception, linking the domains of science and religion, led to a philosophy of existence based on the direct observation of reality from the observer&#x27;s point of view. Much of his thought on phenomenology was not further developed until the 20th century.

===Philosophy of mind===

The philosophy of mind was studied in medieval Islamic psychological thought, which refers to the study of the &quot;nafs&quot; (literally &quot;self&quot; or &quot;psyche&quot; in Arabic) in the Islamic world, particularly during the Islamic Golden Age (8th–15th centuries) as well as modern times (20th–21st centuries), and is related to psychology, psychiatry and the neurosciences.

===Place and space===
The Arab polymath al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen; died c. 1041) presented a thorough mathematical critique and refutation of Aristotle&#x27;s conception of place (&quot;topos&quot;) in his &quot;Risala/Qawl fi’l-makan&quot; (&quot;Treatise/Discourse on Place&quot;).

Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; (Book IV – &quot;Delta&quot;) stated that the place of something is the two-dimensional boundary of the containing body that is at rest and is in contact with what it contains. Ibn al-Haytham disagreed with this definition and demonstrated that place (&quot;al-makan&quot;) is the imagined (three-dimensional) void (&quot;al-khala&#x27; al-mutakhayyal&quot;) between the inner surfaces of the containing body. He showed that place was akin to space, foreshadowing Descartes&#x27;s notion of place as space qua &quot;Extensio&quot; or even Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;analysis situs&quot;. Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s mathematization of place rested on several geometric demonstrations, including his study on the sphere and other solids, which showed that the sphere (&quot;al-kura&quot;) is the largest in magnitude (volumetric) with respect to other geometric solids that have equal surface areas. For instance, a sphere that has an equal surface area to that of a cylinder, would be larger in (volumetric) magnitude than the cylinder; hence, the sphere occupies a larger place than that occupied by the cylinder; unlike what is entailed by Aristotle&#x27;s definition of place: that this sphere and that cylinder occupy places that are equal in magnitude. Ibn al-Haytham rejected Aristotle&#x27;s philosophical concept of place on mathematical grounds. Later, the philosopher &#x27;Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (13th century) tried to defend the Aristotelian conception of place in a treatise titled: &quot;Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan&quot; (&quot;A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s place&quot;), although his effort was admirable from a philosophical standpoint, it was unconvincing from the scientific and mathematical viewpoints.

Ibn al-Haytham also discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his &quot;Book of Optics&quot; (1021). His experimental proof of the intromission model of vision led to changes in the way the visual perception of space was understood, contrary to the previous emission theory of vision supported by Euclid and Ptolemy. In &quot;tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the
intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things.&quot;

== Philosophy of education ==

In the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school was known as a &quot;maktab&quot;, which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like madrasahs (which referred to higher education), a maktab was often attached to a mosque. In the 11th century, Ibn Sina (known as &quot;Avicenna&quot; in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter dealing with the &quot;maktab&quot; entitled &quot;The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children&quot;, as a guide to teachers working at &quot;maktab&quot; schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. Ibn Sina described the curriculum of a &quot;maktab&quot; school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a &quot;maktab&quot; school.

===Primary education===
Ibn Sina wrote that children should be sent to a &quot;maktab&quot; school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote that they should be taught the Qur&#x27;an, Islamic metaphysics, language, literature, Islamic ethics, and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).

===Secondary education===
Ibn Sina refers to the secondary education stage of &quot;maktab&quot; schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship, or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student&#x27;s emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.

== Philosophy of science ==
===Scientific method===
The pioneering development of the scientific method by the Arab Ash&#x27;ari polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) was an important contribution to the philosophy of science. In the &quot;Book of Optics&quot; (c. 1025 CE), his scientific method was very similar to the modern scientific method and consisted of the following procedures:

#Observation
#Statement of problem
#Formulation of hypothesis
#Testing of hypothesis using experimentation
#Analysis of experimental results
#Interpretation of data and formulation of conclusion
#Publication of findings

In &quot;The Model of the Motions&quot;, Ibn al-Haytham also describes an early version of Occam&#x27;s razor, where he employs only minimal hypotheses regarding the properties that characterize astronomical motions, as he attempts to eliminate from his planetary model the cosmological hypotheses that cannot be observed from Earth.

In &quot;Aporias against Ptolemy&quot;, Ibn al-Haytham commented on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge:

He held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge:

Ibn al-Haytham attributed his experimental scientific method and scientific skepticism to his Islamic faith. He believed that human beings are inherently flawed and that only God is perfect. He reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself. In &quot;The Winding Motion&quot;, Ibn al-Haytham further wrote that faith should only apply to prophets of Islam and not to any other authorities, in the following comparison between the Islamic prophetic tradition and the demonstrative sciences:

Ibn al-Haytham described his search for truth and knowledge as a way of leading him closer to God:

His contemporary Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī also introduced an early scientific method in nearly every field of inquiry he studied. For example, in his treatise on mineralogy, &quot;Kitab al-Jamahir&quot; (&quot;Book of Precious Stones&quot;), he is &quot;the most exact of experimental scientists&quot;, while in the introduction to his study of India, he declares that &quot;to execute our project, it has not been possible to follow the geometric method&quot; and develops comparative sociology as a scientific method in the field. He was also responsible for introducing the experimental method into mechanics, the first to conduct elaborate experiments related to astronomical phenomena, and a pioneer of experimental psychology.

Unlike his contemporary Avicenna&#x27;s scientific method where &quot;general and universal questions came first and led to experimental work&quot;, al-Biruni developed scientific methods where &quot;universals came out of practical, experimental work&quot; and &quot;theories are formulated after discoveries.&quot; During his debate with Avicenna on natural philosophy, al-Biruni made the first real distinction between a scientist and a philosopher, referring to Avicenna as a philosopher and considering himself to be a mathematical scientist.

Al-Biruni&#x27;s scientific method was similar to the modern scientific method in many ways, particularly his emphasis on repeated experimentation. Biruni was concerned with how to conceptualize and prevent both systematic errors and random errors, such as &quot;errors caused by the use of small instruments and errors made by human observers.&quot; He argued that if instruments produce random errors because of their imperfections or idiosyncratic qualities, then multiple observations must be taken, analyzed qualitatively, and on this basis, arrive at a &quot;common-sense single value for the constant sought&quot;, whether an arithmetic mean or a &quot;reliable estimate.&quot;

===Experimental medicine===
Avicenna (Ibn Sina) is considered the father of modern medicine, for his introduction of experimental medicine and clinical trials, the experimental use and testing of drugs, and a precise guide for practical experimentation in the process of discovering and proving the effectiveness of medical substances, in his medical encyclopedia, &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; (11th century), which was the first book dealing with experimental medicine. It laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new drugs or medications, which still form the basis of modern clinical trials:

#&quot;The drug must be free from any extraneous accidental quality.&quot;
#&quot;It must be used on a simple, not a composite, disease.&quot;
#&quot;The drug must be tested with two contrary types of diseases, because sometimes a drug cures one disease by Its essential qualities and another by its accidental ones.&quot;
#&quot;The quality of the drug must correspond to the strength of the disease. For example, there are some drugs whose heat is less than the coldness of certain diseases, so that they would have no effect on them.&quot;
#&quot;The time of action must be observed, so that essence and accident are not confused.&quot;
#&quot;The effect of the drug must be seen to occur constantly or in many cases, for if this did not happen, it was an accidental effect.&quot;
#&quot;The experimentation must be done with the human body, for testing a drug on a lion or a horse might not prove anything about its effect on man.&quot;

===Peer review===
The first documented description of a peer review process is found in the &quot;Ethics of the Physician&quot; written by Ishaq bin Ali al-Rahwi (854–931) of al-Raha, Syria, who describes the first medical peer review process. His work, as well as later Arabic medical manuals, state that a visiting physician must always make duplicate notes of a patient&#x27;s condition on every visit. When the patient was cured or had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical council of other physicians, who would review the practising physician&#x27;s notes to decide whether his/her performance have met the required standards of medical care. If their reviews were negative, the practicing physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient.

== Other fields ==

===Epistemology===
Avicenna&#x27;s most influential theory in epistemology is his theory of knowledge, in which he developed the concept of tabula rasa. He argued that the &quot;human intellect at birth is rather like a tabula rasa, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know&quot; and that knowledge is attained through &quot;empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts&quot; which is developed through a &quot;syllogistic method of reasoning; observations lead to prepositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts.&quot;

In the 12th century, Ibn Tufail further developed the concept of tabula rasa in his Arabic novel, &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqzan&quot;, in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child &quot;from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society&quot; on a desert island. The Latin translation of his work, entitled &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;, published by Edward Pococke the Younger in 1671, had an influence on John Locke&#x27;s formulation of tabula rasa in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;.

===Eschatology===

Islamic eschatology is concerned with the &quot;Qiyamah&quot; (end of the world; Last Judgement) and the final judgement of humanity. Eschatology relates to one of the six articles of faith (&quot;aqidah&quot;) of Islam. Like the other Abrahamic religions, Islam teaches the bodily resurrection of the dead, the fulfillment of a divine plan for creation, and the immortality of the human soul (though Jews do not necessarily view the soul as eternal); the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of &quot;Jannah&quot; (Heaven), while the unrighteous are punished in &quot;Jahannam&quot; (Hell). A significant fraction (one third, in fact) of the Quran deals with these beliefs, with many &quot;hadith&quot; elaborating on the themes and details. Islamic apocalyptic literature describing the Armageddon is often known as &quot;fitna&quot; (a test) and &quot;malahim&quot; (or &quot;ghayba&quot; in the Shi&#x27;a tradition).

Ibn al-Nafis dealt with Islamic eschatology in some depth in his &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot;, where he rationalized the Islamic view of eschatology using reason and science to explain the events that would occur according to Islamic eschatology. He presented his rational and scientific arguments in the form of Arabic fiction, hence his &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot; may be considered the earliest science fiction work.

===Legal philosophy===

Sharia () refers to the body of Islamic law. The term means &quot;way&quot; or &quot;path&quot;; it is the legal framework within which public and some private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islamic principles of jurisprudence. Fiqh is the term for Islamic jurisprudence, made up of the rulings of Islamic jurists. A component of Islamic studies, Fiqh expounds the methodology by which Islamic law is derived from primary and secondary sources.

Mainstream Islam distinguish &quot;fiqh&quot;, which means understanding details and inferences drawn by scholars, from &quot;sharia&quot; that refers to principles that lie behind the fiqh. Scholars hope that &quot;fiqh&quot; and &quot;sharia&quot; are in harmony in any given case, but they cannot be sure.

===Philosophical novels===
The Islamic philosophers, Ibn Tufail (Abubacer) and Ibn al-Nafis, were pioneers of the philosophical novel. Ibn Tufail wrote the first fictional Arabic novel &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot; (&quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;) as a response to al-Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;, and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a fictional novel &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot; as a response to Ibn Tufail&#x27;s &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;. Both of these novels had protagonists (Hayy in &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; and Kamil in &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot;) who were autodidactic individuals spontaneously generated in a cave and living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;, the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot;, developing into the first example of a science fiction novel.

Ibn al-Nafis described his book &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot; as a defense of &quot;the system of Islam and the Muslims&#x27; doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world.&quot; He presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality of the human soul, using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus to prove his case. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the metaphysical claim of Avicenna and Ibn Tufail that bodily resurrection cannot be proven through reason, a view that was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali.

A Latin translation of &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; was published in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger. The first English translation by Simon Ockley was published in 1708, and German and Dutch translations were also published at the time. &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; went on to have a significant influence on European literature, and became an influential best-seller throughout Western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. These translations later inspired Daniel Defoe to write &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, which also featured a desert island narrative and was regarded as the first novel in English.

&quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; also had a &quot;profound influence&quot; on modern Western philosophy. It became &quot;one of the most important books that heralded the Scientific Revolution&quot; and European Enlightenment, and the thoughts expressed in the novel can be found in &quot;different variations and to different degrees in the books of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Isaac Newton, and Immanuel Kant.&quot; The novel inspired the concept of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; developed in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1690) by Locke, who was a student of Pococke. &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; also developed the themes of empiricism, tabula rasa, nature versus nurture, condition of possibility, materialism, and Molyneux&#x27;s Problem. The novel also inspired Robert Boyle, another acquaintance of Pococke, to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, &quot;The Aspiring Naturalist&quot;. Other European scholars influenced by &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; include Gottfried Leibniz, Melchisédech Thévenot, John Wallis, Christiaan Huygens, George Keith, Robert Barclay, the Quakers, and Samuel Hartlib.

===Political philosophy===
Early Islamic political philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect &quot;all&quot; philosophy was &quot;political&quot; as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the Mutazilite philosophers, who held a more secular view and were supported by secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate. The only Greek political treatise known to medieval Muslims at the time was Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; and the &quot;Laws&quot;. By the end of the Islamic Golden Age, however, the Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed.

Islamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam, i.e. the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah, the words and practices of Muhammad. However, in the Western thought, it is generally known that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al-Farabi (Alfarabi), İbn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah, sultan, ummah, cemaa -and even the &quot;core&quot; terms of the Qur&#x27;an, i.e. ibada, din, rab and ilah- is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character.

The 14th-century Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist Ernest Gellner considered Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s definition of government, &quot;an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself&quot;, the best in the history of political theory.

===Philosophy of history===
The first detailed studies on the subject of historiography and the first critiques on historical methods appeared in the works of the Arab Ash&#x27;ari polymath Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), who is regarded as the father of historiography, cultural history, and the philosophy of history, especially for his historiographical writings in the &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; (Latinized as &quot;Prolegomena&quot;) and &quot;Kitab al-Ibar&quot; (&quot;Book of Advice&quot;). His &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history, and he discussed the rise and fall of civilizations.

Franz Rosenthal wrote in the &quot;History of Muslim Historiography&quot;:

===Philosophy of religion===
There is an important question on the relation of religion and philosophy, reason and faith and so on. In one hand there is extraordinary importance attached to religion in Islamic civilization and in other hand they created certain doctrines in respect to reason and religion.

===Social philosophy===
The social philosopher and Ash&#x27;ari polymath Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) was the last major Islamic philosopher from Tunis, North Africa. In his &quot;Muqaddimah&quot;, he developed the earliest theories on social philosophy, in formulating theories of social cohesion and social conflict. His &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; was also the introduction to a seven volume analysis of universal history.

Ibn Khaldun is considered the &quot;father of sociology&quot;, &quot;father of historiography&quot;, and &quot;father of the philosophy of history&quot; by some, for allegedly being the first to discuss the topics of sociology, historiography and the philosophy of history in detail.

===Judeo-Islamic philosophies===

Islamic philosophy found an audience with the Jews, to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the Christian world. A series of eminent men—such as the Ibn Tibbons, Narboni, Gersonides—joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Rushd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil Joseph ben Judah, spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Rushd&#x27;s commentary.

The oldest Jewish religio-philosophical work preserved in Arabic is that of Saadia Gaon (892–942), &quot;Emunot ve-Deot&quot;, &quot;The Book of Beliefs and Opinions&quot;. In this work Saadia treats the questions that interested the Mutakallamin, such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. Saadia criticizes other philosophers severely. For Saadia there was no problem as to creation: God created the world &quot;ex nihilo&quot;, just as the Bible attests; and he contests the theory of the Mutakallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter.

To prove the unity of God, Saadia uses the demonstrations of the Mutakallamin. Only the attributes of essence (&quot;sifat al-dhatia&quot;) can be ascribed to God, but not the attributes of action (&quot;sifat-al-fi&#x27;aliya&quot;). The soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the celestial spheres. Here Saadia controverts the Mutakallamin, who considered the soul an &quot;accident&quot; &quot;&#x27;arad&quot; (compare Guide for the Perplexed i. 74), and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position: &quot;Only a substance can be the substratum of an accident&quot; (that is, of a non-essential property of things). Saadia argues: &quot;If the soul be an accident only, it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom, joy, love,&quot; etc. Saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the Kalam; and if at times he deviated from its doctrines, it was owing to his religious views.

Since no idea and no literary or philosophical movement ever germinated on Persian or Arabian soil without leaving its impress on the Jews, Al Ghazali found an imitator in the person of Judah ha-Levi. This poet also took upon himself to free his religion from what he saw as the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the &quot;Kuzari,&quot; in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike. He passes severe censure upon the Mutakallimun for seeking to support religion by philosophy. He says, &quot;I consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them&quot; (&quot;Kuzari,&quot; v.). Then he reduced the chief propositions of the Mutakallamin, to prove the unity of God, to ten in number, describing them at length, and concluding in these terms: &quot;Does the Kalam give us more information concerning God and His attributes than the prophet did?&quot; (Ib. iii. and iv.) Aristotelianism finds no favor in Judah ha-Levi&#x27;s eyes, for it is no less given to details and criticism; Neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat, owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament.

Similarly the reaction in favour of stricter Aristotelianism, as found in Averroes, had its Jewish counterpart in the work of Maimonides. Later Jewish philosophers, such as Gersonides and Elijah Delmedigo, followed the school of Averroes and played a part in transmitting Averroist thought to medieval Europe.

In Spain and Italy, Jewish translators such as Abraham de Balmes and Jacob Mantino translated Arabic philosophic literature into Hebrew and Latin, contributing to the development of modern European philosophy.

== Later Islamic philosophy ==

The death of Ibn Rushd (Averroës) effectively marks the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the &quot;Peripatetic Arabic School&quot;, and philosophical activity declined significantly in western Islamic countries, namely in Islamic Spain and North Africa, though it persisted for much longer in the Eastern countries, in particular Iran and India. Contrary to the traditional view, Dimitri Gutas and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy consider the period between the 11th and 14th centuries to be the true &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Arabic and Islamic philosophy, initiated by Al-Ghazali&#x27;s successful integration of logic into the Madrasah curriculum and the subsequent rise of Avicennism.

Since the political power shift in Western Europe (Spain and Portugal) from Muslim to Christian control, the Muslims naturally did not practice philosophy in Western Europe. This also led to some loss of contact between the &#x27;west&#x27; and the &#x27;east&#x27; of the Islamic world. Muslims in the &#x27;east&#x27; continued to do philosophy, as is evident from the works of Ottoman scholars and especially those living in Muslim kingdoms within the territories of present-day Iran and India, such as Shah Waliullah and Ahmad Sirhindi. This fact has escaped most pre-modern historians of Islamic (or Arabic) philosophy. In addition, logic has continued to be taught in religious seminaries up to modern times.

After Ibn Rushd, there arose many later schools of Islamic Philosophy such as those founded by Ibn Arabi and Shi&#x27;ite Mulla Sadra. These new schools are of particular importance, as they are still active in the Islamic world. The most important among them are:
* School of Illumination (&quot;Hikmat al-Ishraq&quot;)
* Transcendent Theosophy (&quot;Hikmat Muta&#x27;aliah&quot;)
* Sufi philosophy
* Traditionalist School
* Avicennism(Hikmat Sinavi)

===Illuminationist school===

Illuminationist philosophy was a school of Islamic philosophy founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi in the 12th century. This school is a combination of Avicenna&#x27;s philosophy and ancient Iranian philosophy, with many new innovative ideas of Suhrawardi. It is often described as having been influenced by Neoplatonism.

In logic in Islamic philosophy, systematic refutations of Greek logic were written by the Illuminationist school, founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1155–1191), who developed the idea of &quot;decisive necessity&quot;, an important innovation in the history of logical philosophical speculation.

===Transcendent school===

Transcendent theosophy is the school of Islamic philosophy founded by Mulla Sadra in the 17th century. His philosophy and ontology is considered to be just as important to Islamic philosophy as Martin Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy later was to Western philosophy in the 20th century. Mulla Sadra bought &quot;a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of reality&quot; and created &quot;a major transition from essentialism to existentialism&quot; in Islamic philosophy, several centuries before this occurred in Western philosophy.

The idea of &quot;essence precedes existence&quot; is a concept which dates back to Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and his school of Avicennism as well as Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi and his Illuminationist philosophy. The opposite idea of &quot;Existence precedes essence&quot; was thus developed in the works of Averroes and Mulla Sadra as a reaction to this idea and is a key foundational concept of existentialism.

For Mulla Sadra, &quot;existence precedes the essence and is thus principle since something has to exist first and then have an essence.&quot; This is primarily the argument that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra&#x27;s Transcendent Theosophy. Sayyid Jalal Ashtiyani later summarized Mulla Sadra&#x27;s concept as follows:

More careful approaches are needed in terms of thinking about philosophers (and theologians) in Islam in terms of phenomenological methods of investigation in ontology (or onto-theology), or by way of comparisons that are made with Heidegger&#x27;s thought and his critique of the history of metaphysics.

===Contemporary Islamic philosophy===


The tradition of Islamic philosophy is still very much alive today, particularly among followers of Suhrawardi&#x27;s &quot;Hikmat al-Ishraq&quot; (&quot;Illumination Philosophy&quot;) and Mulla Sadra&#x27;s &quot;Hikmat-e-Mota&#x27;aliye&quot; (&quot;Transcendent Theosophy&quot;). Another figure is Muhammad Iqbal, who reshaped and revitalized Islamic philosophy among the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in the early 20th century. His &quot;The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam&quot;  is a milestone in the modern political philosophy of Islam.

In contemporary Islamic regions, the teaching of &quot;hikmat&quot; or &quot;hikmah&quot; has continued to flourish.
*Abdolkarim Soroush, born 1945, Iranian philosopher and religious reformist, exponent of Kantian categories within Islamic thought. 
* Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, was a teacher of the philosophical school of Hikmat-ul-Mutaliya. Before the Islamic Revolution, he was one of the few who formally taught philosophy at the Religious Seminary at Qom.
* Abdollah Javadi-Amoli, Grand Ayatollah is an Iranian Twelver Shi&#x27;a Marja. He is a conservative Iranian politician and one of the prominent Islamic scholars of the Hawza (seminary) in Qom.
* Ahmad Milad Karimi, Afghan philosopher of religion and professor of Islamic Philosophy at the University of Münster in Germany.
* Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, Grand Ayatollah is an Iranian Twelver Shi&#x27;a cleric. Advocate of Islamic philosophy, particularly Hikmat Mutaliyyah.
* Geydar Dzhemal, Russian Islamic philosopher, author of &quot;Orientation - North.&quot; Founding ideologist of Islamic Marxism.
* Muhammad Husayn Tabataba&#x27;i, Grand Ayatollah, Iranian Twelver Shi&#x27;a cleric (&quot;Allameh Tabatabaei&quot;), author of numerous works including the 27-volume Quranic commentary &quot;al-Mizan&quot; ().
* Hamka or Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amirullah was a prominent Indonesian author, Ulema politician, philosophical thinker, and author of Tafir Al Azhar. He was head of Indonesia&#x27;s mufti council (MUI). He resigned when his fatwa against the celebration of Christmas by Muslims was condemned by the Suharto regime. Highly respected in his country, he was also appreciated in Malaysia and Singapore.
* Murtaza Motahhari, the best student of Allamah Tabatabai, a martyr of the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and author of numerous books (an incomplete compilation of his works comprises 25 volumes). He, like his teachers Allama Tabatabai and Ayatollah Khomeini, belong to the philosophical schools of Hikmat-ul-Mutaliya
* Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, who is credited with creating modern Islamist political thought in the 20th century, was the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami and spent his life attempting to revive the Islamic intellectual tradition.

His two most important contributions to philosophy are his books &quot;Our Philosophy&quot; and &quot;The Logical Foundations of Induction.&quot; He is also widely known for his work on economics, including &quot;Our Economics&quot; and &quot;The Non-Usury Banking System&quot; which are two of the most influential works in contemporary Islamic economics.

==== Contemporary perspectives ====
In the contemporary era, some people like the Ali Shariati have considered Islamic philosophy as realism; But there is also a belief that Islam is beyond all of (other) &quot;isms&quot;.

== Criticism ==
Philosophy has not been without criticism amongst Muslims, both contemporary and past. The imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, for whom the Hanbali school of thought is named, rebuked philosophical discussion, once telling proponents of it that he was secure in his religion, but that they were &quot;in doubt, so go to a doubter and argue with him (instead).&quot; Today, Islamic philosophical thought has also been criticized by scholars of the modern Salafi movement.

There would be many Islamic thinkers who were not enthusiastic about the potential of philosophy, but it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed it simply because it was a &quot;foreign science&quot;. Oliver Leaman, an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at. Even the 11th century al-Ghazali, known for his &quot;Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot; critique of philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and logic. His criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions. In his view the three most serious of these were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things, though not all philosophers subscribed to these same views.

In recent studies by Muslim contemporary thinkers that aim at &quot;renewing the impetus of philosophical thinking in Islam,&quot; the philosopher and theorist Nader El-Bizri offers a critical analysis of the conventions that dominate mainstream academic and epistemic approaches in studying Islamic philosophy. These approaches, of methodology and historiography are looked at from archival standpoints within Oriental and Mediaevalist Studies, fail to recognize the fact that philosophy in Islam can still be a living intellectual tradition. He maintains that its renewal requires a radical reform in ontology and epistemology within Islamic thought. El-Bizri&#x27;s interpretations of Avicenna (Ibn Sina) from the standpoint of Heidegger&#x27;s critique of the history of metaphysics, and specifically against the background of the unfolding of the essence of technology, aim at finding new pathways in ontology that are not simply Avicennian nor Heideggerian, even though El-Bizri&#x27;s approach in rethinking &quot;falsafa&quot; amounts to a &quot;Neo-Avicennism&quot; that carries resonances with novel modern philosophical ways of reading Aristotelianism and Thomism. El-Bizri engages contemporary issues in philosophy through a fundamental critical analytic of the evolution of key concepts in the history of ontology and epistemology. Nader El-Bizri is a modernist in outlook since he aims at bringing newness to the tradition rather than simply reproduce it or being in rupture with it.

Maani’ Hammad al-Juhani, (a member of the Consultative Council and General Director, World Assembly of Muslim Youth) 
is quoted as declaring that because philosophy does not follow the moral guidelines of the Sunnah, 
&quot;philosophy, as defined by the philosophers, is one of the most dangerous falsehoods and most vicious in fighting faith and religion on the basis of logic, which it is very easy to use to confuse people in the name of reason, interpretation and metaphor that distort the religious texts&quot;.

<text>Johnny Reid Edwards (born June 10, 1953) is an American lawyer and former politician who represented North Carolina in the United States Senate from 1999 to 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the vice presidential nominee under US Senator John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. He also was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 and 2008.

Edwards defeated the incumbent Republican Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina&#x27;s 1998 Senate election. Toward the end of his six-year term, he declined to seek re-election, and instead sought the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2004 presidential election. Edwards suspended his campaign shortly after Super Tuesday, and later accepted the Democratic vice presidential nomination. 

Following Kerry&#x27;s loss to incumbent President George W. Bush, Edwards began working full-time at the One America Committee, a political action committee he established in 2001, and was appointed director of the Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law. He was also a consultant for Fortress Investment Group LLC.

After his 2008 presidential campaign, Edwards was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 3, 2011, on six felony charges of violating multiple federal campaign contribution laws to cover up an extramarital affair to which he eventually admitted. He was found not guilty on one count, and the judge declared a mistrial on the remaining five charges, as the jury was unable to come to an agreement. The Justice Department dropped the remaining charges and did not attempt to retry Edwards. Though he was not convicted of any crime, the revelation that he had engaged in an extramarital affair and fathered a child while his wife, Elizabeth Edwards, was dying of cancer, severely damaged his public image and effectively ended his political career.

Since the death of Kay Hagan on October 28, 2019, Edwards is the only surviving former Democratic senator from North Carolina.

==Early life and education==

Edwards was born on June 10, 1953, to Wallace Reid Edwards and Catharine Juanita &quot;Bobbie&quot; Edwards (née Wade) in Seneca, South Carolina. The family moved several times during Edwards&#x27;s childhood, eventually settling in Robbins, North Carolina, where his father worked as a textile mill floor worker and was eventually promoted to supervisor. His mother had a roadside antique-finishing business and then worked as a letter carrier when his father left his job. The family attended a Baptist church.

A football star in high school, Edwards was the first person in his family to attend college. He attended Clemson University for one semester before transferring to North Carolina State University. He graduated from NCSU with high honors with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in textile technology and a 3.8 GPA in 1974, and later earned his Juris Doctor from the University of North Carolina School of Law (UNC) with honors.

==Legal career==
After law school, Edwards clerked for federal judge Franklin Dupree in North Carolina, and in 1978 became an associate at the Nashville law firm of Dearborn &amp; Ewing, doing primarily trial work, defending a Nashville bank and other corporate clients. Lamar Alexander, a Republican and future governor of and U.S. Senator from Tennessee, was among Edwards&#x27;s co-workers. The Edwards family returned to North Carolina in 1981, settling in the capital of Raleigh, where he joined the firm of Tharrington, Smith &amp; Hargrove.

In 1984, Edwards was assigned to a medical malpractice lawsuit that had been perceived to be unwinnable; the firm had accepted it only as a favor to an attorney and state senator who did not want to keep it. Nevertheless, Edwards won a $3.7 million verdict on behalf of his client, who had suffered permanent brain and nerve damage after a doctor prescribed an overdose of the anti-alcoholism drug Antabuse during alcohol aversion therapy. In other cases, Edwards sued the American Red Cross three times, alleging transmission of AIDS through tainted blood products, resulting in a confidential settlement each time, and defended a North Carolina newspaper against a libel charge.

In 1985, Edwards represented a five-year-old child born with cerebral palsy – a child whose mother&#x27;s doctor did not choose to perform an immediate Caesarean delivery when a fetal monitor showed she was in distress. Edwards won a $6.5 million verdict for his client, but five weeks later, the presiding judge sustained the verdict on liability but overturned the damage award on grounds that it was &quot;excessive&quot; and that it appeared &quot;to have been given under the influence of passion and prejudice&quot;, adding that in his opinion &quot;the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.&quot; He offered the plaintiffs $3.25 million, half of the jury&#x27;s award, but the child&#x27;s family appealed the case and received $4.25 million in a settlement. Winning this case established the North Carolina precedent of physician and hospital liability for failing to determine whether the patient understood the risks of a particular procedure.

After this trial, Edwards gained national attention as a plaintiff&#x27;s lawyer. He filed at least twenty similar lawsuits in the years following, and achieved verdicts and settlements of more than $60 million for his clients. Similar lawsuits followed across the country. When asked about an increase in Caesarean deliveries nationwide, perhaps to avoid similar medical malpractice lawsuits, Edwards said, &quot;The question is, would you rather have cases where that happens instead of having cases where you don&#x27;t intervene and a child either becomes disabled for life or dies in utero?&quot;

In 1993, Edwards began his own firm in Raleigh (now named Kirby &amp; Holt) with a friend, David Kirby. He became known as the top plaintiffs&#x27; attorney in North Carolina. The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a girl who at five years old sustained pool suction-drain injury. She was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool drain pump when she sat on an open pool drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.

In his closing arguments, Edwards spoke to the jury for an hour and a half and made reference to his son, Wade, who had been killed shortly before testimony began. Mark Dayton, editor of &quot;North Carolina Lawyers Weekly&quot;, would later call it &quot;the most impressive legal performance I have ever seen.&quot; The jury awarded the family $25 million, the largest personal injury award in North Carolina history. The company settled for the $25 million while the jury was deliberating additional punitive damages, rather than risk a further award. For their part in this case, Edwards and law partner David Kirby earned the Association of Trial Lawyers of America&#x27;s national award for public service. The family said that they hired Edwards over other attorneys because he alone had offered to accept a smaller percentage as his fee unless the award was unexpectedly high, while all of the other lawyers they spoke with said they required the full one-third fee. The size of the jury award was unprecedented, and Edwards did receive the standard one-third-plus-expenses fee typical of contingency cases. The family was so impressed with his intelligence and commitment that they volunteered for his Senate campaign the next year.

After Edwards won a large verdict against a trucking company whose worker had been involved in a fatal accident, the North Carolina legislature passed a law prohibiting such awards unless the company had specifically sanctioned the employee&#x27;s actions.

In December 2003, during his first presidential campaign, Edwards (with John Auchard) published &quot;Four Trials&quot;, an autobiographical book focusing on cases from his legal career. According to this book, the success of the Sta-Rite case and his son&#x27;s death (Edwards had hoped his son would eventually join him in private law practice) prompted Edwards to leave the legal profession and seek public office.

Edwards, his daughter Cate, and David Kirby started a new law firm in 2013, named Edwards Kirby, with offices in Raleigh and in Washington, D.C.

==Political career==

===Policy positions===
Edwards promotes programs to eliminate poverty in the United States, including arguing in favor of creating one million housing vouchers over five years in order to place poor people in middle-class neighborhoods. Edwards has stated, &quot;If we truly believe that we are all equal, then we should live together too.&quot; He also supports &quot;College for Everyone&quot; initiatives.
Although Edwards initially supported the Iraq War, he later changed his position and in November 2005 wrote an op-ed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which he said he expressed regret for voting for the Iraq War Resolution and discussed three solutions for success in the conflict. He denounced the &quot;troop surge&quot; in Iraq, was a proponent for withdrawal, and urged Congress to withhold funding for the war without a withdrawal timetable.

On social policy, Edwards supports abortion rights and has a universal healthcare plan that requires all Americans to purchase healthcare insurance, &quot;requires that everybody get preventive care&quot;, and requires employers to provide health care insurance or be taxed to fund public health care. He supports a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, is opposed to a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage; and supports the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).

Edwards endorsed efforts to slow down global warming and was the first presidential candidate to describe his campaign as carbon-neutral.

===Senate tenure===

Edwards won election to the U.S. Senate in 1998 as a Democrat running against incumbent Republican Senator Lauch Faircloth. Despite originally being the underdog, Edwards beat Faircloth by 51.2% to 47.0% — a margin of some 83,000 votes. He served alongside fellow Republican Senator Jesse Helms until Helms left office in 2003, having chosen to not seek reelection in 2002.

During President Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1999 impeachment trial in the Senate, Edwards was responsible for the deposition of witnesses Monica Lewinsky and fellow Democrat Vernon Jordan, Jr. During the 2000 presidential campaign, Edwards was on Democratic nominee Al Gore&#x27;s vice presidential nominee short list (along with John Kerry and Joe Lieberman, Gore&#x27;s eventual pick).

In his time in the Senate, Edwards co-sponsored 203 bills. Among them was Lieberman&#x27;s 2002 Iraq War Resolution (S.J.Res.46), which he co-sponsored along with 15 other senators, but which did not go to a vote. He voted for replacement resolution (H.J Res. 114) in the full Senate to authorize the use of military force against Iraq, which passed by a vote of 77 to 23, On October 10, 2002, he stated that:

On October 10, 2004, Edwards further defended his vote during an appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;: 

Edwards subsequently changed his mind about the war and apologized for that military authorization vote. Edwards also voted in favor of the Patriot Act.

Among other positions, Edwards was generally pro-choice and supported affirmative action and the death penalty. One of his first sponsored bills was the &quot;Fragile X Research Breakthrough Act of 1999&quot;. He was also the first person to introduce comprehensive anti-spyware legislation with the &quot;Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act&quot;. He advocated rolling back the Bush administration&#x27;s tax cuts and ending mandatory minimum sentencing for non-violent offenders. Edwards generally supported expanding legal immigration to the United States while working with Mexico to provide better border security and stop illegal trafficking.

Edwards served on the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the U.S. Senate Committee on Judiciary, and was a member of the New Democrat Coalition.

Before the 2004 Senate election, Edwards announced his retirement from the Senate and supported Erskine Bowles, former White House Chief of Staff, as the successor to his seat; Bowles was defeated by Republican Richard Burr in the election.

===Post-Senate activities===
The day after his concession speech, he announced his wife Elizabeth had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Edwards told interviewer Larry King that he doubted he would return to practice as a trial lawyer and showed no interest in succeeding Terry McAuliffe as the Democratic National Committee chairman.

In February 2005, Edwards headlined the &quot;100 Club&quot; Dinner, a major fundraiser for the New Hampshire Democratic Party. That same month, Edwards was appointed as director of the Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for studying ways to move people out of poverty. That fall, Edwards toured ten major universities in order to promote &quot;Opportunity Rocks!&quot;, a program aimed at getting youth involved to fight poverty.

On March 21, 2005, Edwards recorded his first podcast with his wife. Several months later, in August, Edwards delivered an address to a potential key supporter in the Iowa caucus, the AFL–CIO in Waterloo, Iowa.

In the following month, Edwards sent an email to his supporters and announced that he opposed the nomination of Judge John G. Roberts to become Chief Justice of the United States. He was also opposed to the nomination of Justice Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice and Judge Charles Pickering&#x27;s appointment to the Federal bench.

During the summer and fall of 2005, he visited homeless shelters and job training centers and spoke at events organized by ACORN, the NAACP and the SEIU. He spoke in favor of an expansion of the earned income tax credit; in favor of a crackdown on predatory lending; an increase in the capital gains tax rate; housing vouchers for racial minorities (to integrate upper-income neighborhoods); and a program modeled on the Works Progress Administration to rehabilitate the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. In Greene County, North Carolina, he unveiled the pilot program for College for Everyone, an educational measure he promised during his presidential campaign, in which prospective college students would receive a scholarship for their first year in exchange for ten hours of work a week. The College for Everyone program was canceled in July 2008.

Edwards was co-chair of a Council on Foreign Relations task force on United States-Russia relations alongside Republican Jack Kemp, a former congressman, Cabinet official and vice presidential nominee. The task force issued its report in March 2006. On July 12, the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; published a related op-ed by Edwards and Kemp.

In October 2005, Edwards joined the Wall Street investment firm Fortress Investment Group as a senior adviser and consultant, a position for which a close aide reported he received an annual salary of $500,000. Fortress owned a major stake in Green Tree Servicing LLC, which rose to prominence in the 1990s selling subprime loans to mobile-home owners and now services subprime loans originated by others, but in an interview Edwards said he was unaware of this. Subprime loans allow buyers with poor credit histories to be funded, but they charge higher rates because of the risk, and sometimes carry hidden fees and increased charges over time. In August 2007, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that a portion of the Edwards family&#x27;s assets were invested in Fortress Investment Group, which had, in turn, invested a portion of its assets in subprime mortgage lenders, some of which had foreclosed on the homes of Hurricane Katrina victims. Upon learning of Fortress&#x27;s investments, Edwards divested funds and stated that he would try to help the affected families. Edwards later helped set up an ACORN-administered &quot;Louisiana Home Rescue Fund&quot; seeded with $100,000, much of it from his pocket, to provide loans and grants to the families who were foreclosed on by Fortress-owned lenders.

Edwards is now a personal injury lawyer in Pitt County, North Carolina. He was invited to and attended the 2024 Democratic National Convention, which was the first DNC he attended since his Vice-Presidential nomination in Boston, twenty years earlier.

===2004 presidential campaign===
In 2000, Edwards unofficially began his presidential campaign when he began to seek speaking engagements in Iowa, the site of the nation&#x27;s first party caucuses. On January 2, 2003, Edwards began fundraising without officially campaigning by forming an exploratory committee. On September 15, 2003, Edwards fulfilled a promise he made a year earlier as a guest on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; to unofficially announce his intention to seek the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination. The next morning, Edwards made the announcement officially from his hometown. He declined to run for reelection to the Senate in order to focus on his presidential run. Edwards&#x27;s campaign was chaired by North Carolina Democratic activist Ed Turlington.

As Edwards had been building support essentially since his election to the Senate, he led the initial campaign fundraising, amassing over $7 million during the first quarter of 2003 – more than half of which came from individuals associated with the legal profession, particularly Edwards&#x27;s fellow trial lawyers, their families, and employees. Edwards&#x27;s stump speech spoke of &quot;Two Americas&quot;, with one composed of the wealthy and privileged, and the other of the hard-working common man, causing the media to often characterize Edwards as a populist.

Edwards struggled to gain substantial support, but his poll numbers began to rise steadily weeks before the Iowa caucuses. In these he had a surprising second-place finish with the support of 32% of delegates, behind only John Kerry&#x27;s 39% and ahead of former front-runner Howard Dean at 18%. One week later in the New Hampshire primary, Edwards finished in fourth place behind Kerry, Dean and Wesley Clark, with 12%. During the February 3 primaries, Edwards won the South Carolina primary, lost to Clark in Oklahoma, and lost to Kerry in the other states. Edwards garnered the second-largest number of second-place finishes, again falling behind Clark.
Dean withdrew from the contest, leaving Edwards the only major challenger to Kerry. In the Wisconsin primary on February 17, Edwards finished second to Kerry with 34% of the vote. He largely avoided attacking Kerry until a February 29, 2004, debate in New York, in which he characterized him as a &quot;Washington insider&quot; and mocked Kerry&#x27;s plan to form a committee to examine trade agreements.

In the Super Tuesday primaries on March 2, Kerry finished well ahead in nine of the ten states voting, and Edwards&#x27;s campaign ended. In Georgia, Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry but, failing to win a single state, chose to withdraw from the race. He announced his official withdrawal at a press conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, on March 3. Edwards&#x27;s withdrawal made major media outlets relatively early on the evening of Super Tuesday, at about 6:30 pm CST, before polls had closed in California and before caucuses in Minnesota had even begun. It is thought that the withdrawal influenced many people in Minnesota to vote for other candidates, which may partially account for the strong Minnesota finish of Dennis Kucinich. Edwards did win the presidential straw poll conducted by the Independence Party of Minnesota.

After withdrawing from the race, he went on to win the April 17 Democratic caucuses in his home state of North Carolina, making him the only Democratic candidate besides Kerry to win nominating contests in two states in 2004.

===2004 vice presidential nomination===

On July 6, 2004, Kerry announced that Edwards would be his running mate; the decision was widely hailed in public opinion polls and by Democratic leaders. Though many Democrats supported Edwards&#x27;s nomination, others criticized the selection for Edwards&#x27;s perceived lack of experience. In the vice presidential debate, Dick Cheney told Edwards they had never met because of Edwards&#x27;s frequent absences from the Senate, but that was later proven to be incorrect. Videotape later surfaced of Cheney and Edwards shaking hands off-camera during a taping of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on April 8, 2001. On February 1, 2001, Cheney thanked Edwards by name and sat with him during a Senate prayer breakfast. George W. Bush&#x27;s campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt described the event as an &quot;inconsequential meeting&quot;. On January 8, 2003, they met when John Edwards accompanied then-Senator Elizabeth Dole to her swearing-in while Cheney was President of the Senate.

Kerry&#x27;s campaign advisor Bob Shrum later reported in &quot;Time&quot; magazine that Kerry said he wished he had never picked Edwards, and the two have since stopped speaking to each other. Edwards said in his concession speech, &quot;You can be disappointed, but you cannot walk away. This fight has just begun.&quot;

===2008 presidential campaign===
On December 28, 2006, John Edwards officially announced his candidacy for President in the 2008 election from the yard of a home in New Orleans, Louisiana, that was being rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina destroyed it. Edwards stated that his main goals were eliminating poverty, fighting global warming, providing universal health care, and withdrawing troops from Iraq.

National polls had Edwards placing third among the Democratic field beginning in January 2007, behind Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. By July 2007, the Edwards campaign had raised $23 million from nearly 100,000 donors, placing him behind Obama and Clinton in fundraising.

Edwards was first to boycott a Fox News-sponsored presidential debate in March 2007. Hillary Clinton, Bill Richardson, and Barack Obama followed suit.

On January 3, 2008, in the Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the nomination process, Edwards placed second with 29.75% of the vote to Obama (37.58%), with Clinton coming in third with 29.47% of the vote. On January 8, Edwards placed a distant third in the New Hampshire Democratic primary with just under 17% (48,818 votes). On January 26, Edwards again placed third in the primary in South Carolina – his birth state – which he had carried in 2004, and he placed third in the non-binding January 29 vote in Florida.
On January 30, 2008, following his primary and caucus losses, Edwards announced that he was suspending his campaign for the presidency. He did not initially endorse either Clinton or Obama, saying they both had pledged to carry forward his central campaign theme of ending poverty in America. In April 2008, he stated that he would not accept the 2008 vice presidential slot if asked. On May 14, 2008, Edwards officially endorsed Senator Obama at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

On June 15, 2008, Edwards stepped back from his initial outright denial of interest in the position of Vice President, saying, &quot;I&#x27;d take anything he asks me to think about seriously, but obviously this is something that I&#x27;ve done and it&#x27;s not a job I&#x27;m seeking.&quot; On June 20, 2008, the Associated Press reported that according to a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, the names of Edwards and Sam Nunn were on Obama&#x27;s vice presidential shortlist. Ultimately, then-Senator Joe Biden of Delaware was tapped to become Obama&#x27;s running mate.

==Personal life==

===Family===
While at UNC, he met Elizabeth Anania. They married in 1977 and had four children (Wade in 1979, Cate in 1982, Emma Claire in 1998, and Jack in 2000). In a widely-publicized extramarital affair, he fathered a daughter in 2008 with Rielle Hunter, a staffer on his 2008 presidential campaign. Edwards denied being the father until 2010.

Wade was killed in a car accident when strong winds swept his Jeep off a North Carolina highway in 1996. Three weeks before his death, he was honored by First Lady Hillary Clinton at The White House as one of the 10 finalists in an essay contest sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Voice of America for an essay he wrote on entering the voting booth with his father. Wade, accompanied by his parents and sister, went on to meet North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, who later entered Wade&#x27;s essay and his obituary into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;. Edwards and his wife began the Wade Edwards Foundation in their son&#x27;s memory; the purpose of the non-profit organization is &quot;to reward, encourage, and inspire young people in the pursuit of excellence.&quot; The foundation funded the Wade Edwards Learning Lab at Wade&#x27;s high school, Needham B. Broughton High School in Raleigh, along with scholarship competitions and essay awards.

On November 3, 2004, Elizabeth Edwards revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She was treated by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and continued to work within the Democratic Party and her husband&#x27;s One America Committee. On March 22, 2007, during his campaign for the 2008 Democratic nomination for the presidency, Edwards and his wife announced that her cancer had returned; she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, with newly discovered metastases to the bone and possibly to her lung. They said that the cancer was &quot;no longer curable, but is completely treatable&quot; and that they planned to continue campaigning together with an occasional break when she required treatment.

In June 2010, Elizabeth published a book called &quot;Resilience&quot;. Her book is about the struggles of her marriage and how she was affected by her husband&#x27;s affair. In the book, Elizabeth talks about how long she was in the dark about the affair and how many times her husband lied about the details of the affair. She never addresses John&#x27;s mistress by name but calls her a &quot;parasitic groupie&quot; and claims that she is &quot;pathetic&quot;. Elizabeth also opens up about how she tried to forgive her husband after she first learned of the affair but struggled to find forgiveness when he continued to lie. After Edwards&#x27;s January 21, 2010, admission that he fathered a child with his mistress, Elizabeth obtained a legal separation from him and intended to file for divorce after a mandatory one-year waiting period.

On December 7, 2010, Elizabeth died of metastatic breast cancer, aged 61.

===Residence===
In Washington, D.C., Edwards lived on Embassy Row, at 2215 30th Street NW. In 2004, he sold his house to the Hungarian Embassy to the United States.

===Extramarital affair===

In October 2007, &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; began a series of reports alleging an adulterous affair between Edwards and former campaign worker Rielle Hunter. By July 2008, several news media outlets speculated that Edwards&#x27;s chances for the vice presidency as well as other positions such as the attorney general were harmed by the allegations, which now included that he fathered a child with Hunter and had visited her and the baby girl at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. The story was not widely covered by the press for some time, until, after initially denying the allegations, Edwards admitted the affair.

In an August 8, 2008, statement, and an interview with Bob Woodruff of ABC News, Edwards admitted the affair with Hunter in 2006, but denied being the father of her child. He acknowledged that he had been dishonest in denying the entire &quot;Enquirer&quot; story, admitting that some of it was true, but said that the affair ended long before the time of the child&#x27;s conception. He further said he was willing to take a paternity test, but Hunter responded that she would not be party to a DNA test &quot;now or in the future&quot;. Initially, campaign aide Andrew Young claimed that he, not Edwards, was the child&#x27;s father. Young later renounced that statement, instead alleging that Edwards always knew he was the child&#x27;s father and had pleaded with him to falsely accept responsibility.

Young further claimed to have set up private meetings between Edwards and Hunter, and that Edwards once calmed an anxious Hunter by promising her that after his wife died he would marry her in a rooftop ceremony in New York with an appearance by the Dave Matthews Band. Young also maintains that Edwards asked him to &quot;Get a doctor to fake the DNA results ... and to steal a diaper from the baby so he could secretly do a DNA test to find out if this [was] indeed his child.&quot;

On January 21, 2010, John Edwards issued a press release to admit that he fathered Hunter&#x27;s child. On February 2, 2010, Young released a book detailing the affair. Young also began working with Aaron Sorkin on a movie about the affair based on the book &quot;The Politician&quot;. On February 23, 2012, an Orange County, North Carolina, judge ruled that Young and his wife could not publicize the movie. The judge also ruled that an alleged &quot;sex tape&quot; of Edwards and Hunter be destroyed by the court. The judge also allowed only the materials already in the public domain to be used for public purposes. All other photos and materials not yet released can be used for family purposes only.

Reports surfaced in late 2011 in &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; and &quot;RadarOnline.com&quot; that Edwards asked his former mistress to move into his North Carolina home, where he had once lived with his wife. In 2012, Rielle Hunter announced her breakup with Edwards the same day she released a book about their relationship.

In response to the scandal involving Edwards&#x27;s extramarital affair and attempts to cover it up, he has stated &quot;I am a sinner, but not a criminal.&quot;

===Legal troubles===
In May 2009, newspapers reported that Edwards&#x27;s campaign was being investigated for conversion of campaign money to personal use related to the affair. Edwards said that the campaign was complying with the inquiry. The relevant US attorney refused to comment. In the same month, George Stephanopoulos of ABC News reported that members of Edwards&#x27;s staff had told him that they had planned a &quot;doomsday strategy&quot; to derail Edwards&#x27;s campaign if he got close to the nomination. Joe Trippi, a senior advisor to the campaign, said the report was &quot;complete bullshit&quot;. In August 2009, Rielle Hunter appeared before the grand jury investigating this matter. On March 15, 2010, Hunter broke her silence during an interview with &quot;GQ&quot; magazine and provided new details about the affair. In March 2011, voicemail messages allegedly left by John Edwards were obtained, which Young says prove that Edwards arranged the cover-up of his affair with Hunter.

On May 24, 2011, ABC News and the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the U.S Department of Justice&#x27;s Public Integrity Section had conducted a two-year investigation into whether Edwards had used more than $1 million in political donations to hide his affair and planned to pursue criminal charges for alleged violations of campaign finance laws.

On June 3, 2011, Edwards was indicted by a federal grand jury in North Carolina on six felony charges, including four counts of collecting illegal campaign contributions, one count of conspiracy, and one count of making false statements.

After postponing the start of the trial while Edwards was treated for a heart condition in February 2012, Judge Catherine Eagles of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina scheduled jury selection to begin on April 12, 2012. Edwards&#x27;s trial began on April 23, 2012, as he faced up to 30 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine.

In a related development, on March 13, 2012, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Edwards&#x27;s campaign must repay $2.1 million in matching federal funds. Edwards&#x27;s lawyers claimed the money was used, and that the campaign did not receive all the funds to which it was entitled, but the Commission rejected the arguments.

Twelve jurors and four alternates were seated, and opening arguments began April 23, 2012. Closing arguments took place May 17, and the case went to the jury the next day.

On May 31, 2012, Edwards was found not guilty on Count 3, illegal use of campaign funding (contributions from Rachel &quot;Bunny&quot; Mellon), while mistrials were declared on all other counts against him. On June 13, 2012, the Justice Department announced that it dropped the charges and would not attempt to retry Edwards.

==Return to law practice==
After his political career ended, Edwards, along with attorneys David Kirby and William Bystrynski, founded the law firm Edwards Kirby in Raleigh, specializing in medical malpractice cases. In 2015, his daughter Cate was the managing attorney of the San Diego office of the firm.

<doc id="166164" wikidata="Q208571" url="?curid=166164" title="Agenda 21">
<text>Agenda 21 is a non-binding action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development. It is a product of the Earth Summit (UN Conference on Environment and Development) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. It is an action agenda for the UN, other multilateral organizations, and individual governments around the world that can be executed at local, national, and global levels. One major objective of the Agenda 21 initiative is that every local government should draw its own local Agenda 21. Its aim initially was to achieve global sustainable development by 2000, with the &quot;21&quot; in Agenda 21 referring to the original target of the 21st century.

== Structure ==

Agenda 21 is grouped into 4 sections:
* &quot;Section I: Social and Economic Dimensions&quot; is directed toward combating poverty, especially in developing countries, changing consumption patterns, promoting health, achieving a more sustainable population, and sustainable settlement in decision making.
* &quot;Section II: Conservation and Management of Resources for Development&quot; includes atmospheric protection, combating deforestation, protecting fragile environments, conservation of biological diversity (biodiversity), control of pollution and the management of biotechnology, and radioactive wastes.
* &quot;Section III: Strengthening the Role of Major Groups&quot; includes the roles of children and youth, women, NGOs, local authorities, business and industry, and workers; and strengthening the role of indigenous peoples, their communities, and farmers.
* &quot;Section IV: Means of Implementation&quot; includes science, technology transfer, education international institutions, and financial mechanisms.

==Development and evolution==
The full text of Agenda 21 was made public at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit), held in Rio de Janeiro on 13 June 1992, where 178 governments voted to adopt the program. The final text was the result of drafting, consultation, and negotiation, beginning in 1989 and culminating at the two-week conference.

===Rio+5 (1997)===
In 1997, the UN General Assembly held a special session to appraise the status of Agenda 21 (Rio +5). The Assembly recognized progress as &quot;uneven&quot; and identified key trends, including increasing globalization, widening inequalities in income, and continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly Resolution (S-19/2) promised further action.

===Rio+10 (2002)===
The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), affirmed UN commitment to &quot;full implementation&quot; of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other international agreements.

=== Agenda 21 for culture (2002) ===
The first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2002, came up with the idea to establish guidelines for local cultural policies, something comparable to what Agenda 21 was for the environment. They are to be included in various subsections of Agenda 21 and will be carried out through a wide range of sub-programs beginning with G8 countries.

===Rio+20 (2012)===

In 2012, at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development the attending members reaffirmed their commitment to Agenda 21 in their outcome document called &quot;The Future We Want&quot;. Leaders from 180 nations participated.

=== Sustainable Development Summit (2015) ===
Agenda 2030, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals, was a set of goals decided upon at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015. It takes all of the goals set by Agenda 21 and re-asserts them as the basis for sustainable development, saying, &quot;We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development…&quot; Adding onto those goals from the original Rio document, a total of 17 goals have been agreed on, revolving around the same concepts of Agenda 21; people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership.

==Implementation==
The Commission on Sustainable Development acts as a high-level forum on sustainable development and has acted as preparatory committee for summits and sessions on the implementation of Agenda 21. The UN Division for Sustainable Development acts as the secretariat to the Commission and works &quot;within the context of&quot; Agenda 21.

Implementation by member states remains voluntary, and its adoption has varied.

=== Local level ===

The implementation of Agenda 21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally, as recommended in Chapter 28 of the document. These programs are often known as &quot;Local Agenda 21&quot; or &quot;LA21&quot;. For example, in the Philippines, the plan is &quot;Philippines Agenda 21&quot; (PA21). The group, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, formed in 1990; today its members come from over 1,000 cities, towns, and counties in 88 countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda 21 implementation.

Europe turned out to be the continent where LA21 was best accepted and most implemented. In Sweden, for example, four small- to medium-sized municipalities in the south-east of Sweden were chosen for a 5-year study of their Local Agenda 21 (LA21) processes a Local Agenda 21 initiative.

==Regional levels==

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs&#x27; Division for Sustainable Development monitors and evaluates progress, nation by nation, towards the adoption of Agenda 21, and makes these reports available to the public on its website.

The Rio+10 report identified over 6400 local governments in 113 countries worldwide that were engaged in Local Agenda 21 (LA21) activities, a more than three-fold increase over less than five years. 80% = 5120 of these local governments, were located in Europe. A significant increase has been noted in the number of countries in which one or more LA21 processes were underway.

===Australia===
Australia is a signatory to Agenda 21 and 88 of its municipalities subscribe to ICLEI, an organization that promotes Agenda 21 globally. Australia&#x27;s membership is second only to that of the United States.

===Africa===
In Africa, national support for Agenda 21 is strong and most countries are signatories. But support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country; for example, in 2002 Sam Nujoma, who was then President of Namibia, spoke about the importance of adhering to Agenda 21 at the 2002 Earth Summit, noting that as a semi-arid country, Namibia sets a lot of store in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Furthermore, there is little mention of Agenda 21 at the local level in indigenous media. Only major municipalities in sub-Saharan African countries are members of ICLEI. Agenda 21 participation in North African countries mirrors that of Middle Eastern countries, with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa generally have poorly documented Agenda 21 status reports. By contrast, South Africa&#x27;s participation in Agenda 21 mirrors that of modern Europe, with 21 city members of ICLEI and support of Agenda 21 by national-level government.

===North America===
====United States====

The national focal point in the United States is the Division Chief for Sustainable Development and Multilateral Affairs, Office of Environmental Policy, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, U.S. Department of State. A June 2012 poll of 1,300 United States voters by the American Planning Association found that 9% supported Agenda 21, 6% opposed it, and 85% thought they didn&#x27;t have enough information to form an opinion.

===== Support =====
The United States is a signatory country to Agenda 21, but because Agenda 21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty, the United States Senate did not hold a formal debate or vote on it. It is therefore not considered to be law under Article Six of the United States Constitution. President George H. W. Bush was one of the 178 heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in 1992, and in the same year Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Eliot Engel and William Broomfield spoke in support of United States House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution 353, supporting implementation of Agenda 21 in the United States. Created by Executive Order 12852 in 1993, the President&#x27;s Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD) is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the President. The PCSD is composed of leaders from government and industry, as well as from environmental, labor and civil rights organizations. The PCSD submitted its report, &quot;Sustainable America: A New Consensus&quot;, to the President in early 1996. In the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the United States, the PCSD was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of Agenda 21. Executive Order 12852 was revoked by Executive Order 13138 in 1999. The PCSD set 10 common goals to support the Agenda 21 movement:

# Health and the environment 
# Economic Prosperity 
# Equity 
# Conservation of nature 
# Stewardship 
# Sustainable communities 
# Civic engagement 
# Population 
# International responsibility 
# Education.

In the United States, over 528 cities are members of ICLEI, an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the Agenda 21 and Local Agenda 21 concepts across the world. The United States has nearly half of the ICLEI&#x27;s global membership of 1,200 cities promoting sustainable development at a local level. The United States also has one of the most comprehensively documented Agenda 21 status reports. In response to the opposition, Don Knapp, U.S. spokesman for the ICLEI, has said &quot;Sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the U.N., but a bottom-up push from local governments&quot;.

===== Opposition =====
Agenda 21 fears have played a role in opposition to local government&#x27;s efforts to promote resource and land conservation, build bike lanes, and construct hubs for public transportation. The non-profit group ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability USA – was targeted by anti-Agenda 21 activists. In 2012, fears of Agenda 21 &quot;went mainstream&quot; when the Republican National Committee adopted a platform resolution stated that &quot;We strongly reject the U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of American sovereignty.&quot;

Several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing Agenda 21. Most such bills failed, &quot;either dying in committee, getting defeated on the statehouse floor or – in the case of Missouri&#x27;s 2013 bill – getting vetoed by the governor.&quot; In Texas, for example, broadly worded legislation that would prohibit any governmental entity from accepting from or granting money to any &quot;nongovernmental or intergovernmental organization accredited by the United Nations to implement a policy that originated in the Agenda 21 plan&quot; was defeated because it could have cut off funding for groups such as 4-H, the Boy Scouts of America, and the Texas Wildlife Association. In Arizona, a similarly sweeping bill was introduced in the Arizona State Legislature seeking to mandate that the state could not &quot;adopt or implement the creed, doctrine, or principles or any tenet&quot; of Agenda 21 and to prohibit the state &quot;implementing programs of, expending any sum of money for, being a member of, receiving funding from, contracting services from, or giving financial or other forms of aid to&quot; an array of sustainability organizations. The bill, which was opposed by the state chamber of commerce and the mayor of Phoenix, was defeated in 2012. Alabama was one state that did adopt an anti-Agenda 21 law, unanimously passing in 2012 a measure to block &quot;any future effort to &#x27;deliberately or inadvertently infringe or restrict private property rights without due process, as may be required by policy recommendations originating in, or traceable to &#x27;Agenda 21.&#x27;&quot;

In 2023, Tennessee enacted legislation to block the implementation of Agenda 21 and other programs “originating in, or traceable to, the United Nations or a subsidiary entity of the United Nations.”

===== Conspiracy theories =====
The right-wing John Birch Society described Agenda 21 as a plot, disguised as an environmental movement, to end individual freedom and establish a one-world government. Activists believed that the non-binding UN resolution was &quot;the linchpin in a plot to subjugate humanity under an eco-totalitarian regime.&quot; The conspiracy had its roots in anti-environmentalist ideology and opposition to land-use regulation.

Anti-Agenda 21 theories have circulated in the U.S. Some Tea Party movement activists and others promoted the notion that Agenda 21 was part of a UN plot to deny property rights, undermine U.S. sovereignty, or force citizens to move to cities.

Glenn Beck warned that Agenda 21 was a &quot;seditious&quot; conspiracy to cut the world population by 85%. He claimed it represents a move towards &quot;government control on a global level&quot; and the creation of a &quot;police state&quot; that would lead to &quot;totalitarianism.&quot; Beck described the dystopia it would cause if the world followed the UN plan in a 2012 novel he co-authored called &quot;Agenda 21&quot;.

===Europe===
The Rio+10 report identified 5120 of local governments in Europe having a &quot;Local Agenda 21&quot;. As most Europeans live in about 800 cities of +50.000 inhabitants, it is fair to say that just about all EU cities, communes and villages have a local Agenda 21.

For example:

By 1997, 70% of UK local authorities had committed to Agenda 21. Many, such as the London Borough of Enfield, employed Agenda 21 officers to promote the programme.

Sweden reported that 100% of the municipalities had adopted LA21 by 2002.

France, whose national government, along with 14 cities, is a signatory, promotes nationwide programs in support of the goals of Agenda 21.

Baltic nations formed the Baltic 21 coalition as a regional expression of Agenda 21.

<text>Antoine Héroet, surnamed La Maison-Neuve (died 1568) was a French poet.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris of a family connected with the well known chancellor François Olivier.
His poetry belongs to his early years, for after he had taken orders he ceased to write profane poetry, no doubt because he considered it out of keeping with his calling. He attained the dignity of bishop of Digue.

==Work==
His chief work is &quot;La Parfaicte Amye&quot; (Lyons, 1542) in which he developed the idea of a purely spiritual love, based chiefly on the reading of the Italian Neo-Platonists. The book aroused great controversy. La Borderie replied in &quot;L&#x27;Amie de cour&quot; with a description of a very much more human woman, and Charles Fontaine contributed a &quot;Contr&#x27;amye de court&quot; to the dispute.

Héroet, in addition to some translations from the classics, wrote the &quot;Complainte d&#x27;une dame nouvellement surprise d&#x27;amour&quot;, an &quot;Epistre a François Ier&quot;, and some pieces included in the now very rare &quot;Opuscules d&#x27;amour par Héroet&quot;, &quot;La Borderie et autres divins poetes&quot; (Lyons, 1547). Héroet belongs to the Lyonnese school of which Maurice Scève may be regarded as the leader. Clément Marot praises him, and Ronsard was careful to exempt him with one or two others from the scorn he poured on his immediate predecessors.

<text>Maurice Scève ( – ) was a French poet active in Lyon during the Renaissance period. He was the centre of the Lyonnese côterie that elaborated the theory of spiritual love, derived partly from Plato and partly from Petrarch. This spiritual love, which animated Antoine Héroet&#x27;s &quot;Parfaicte Amye&quot; (1543) as well, owed much to Marsilio Ficino, the Florentine translator and commentator of Plato&#x27;s works.

Scève&#x27;s chief works are &quot;Délie, objet de plus haulte vertu&quot; (1544); five anatomical blazons; the elegy &quot;Arion&quot; (1536) and the eclogue &quot;La Saulsaye&quot; (1547); and &quot;Microcosme&quot; (1562), an encyclopaedic poem beginning with the fall of man. Scève&#x27;s epigrams, which have seen renewed critical interest since the late 19th century, were seen as difficult even in Scève&#x27;s own day, although Scève was praised by Du Bellay Bellay, Ronsard, Pontus de Tyard and Des Autels for raising French poetry to new, higher aesthetic standards.

==Life==

Scève is believed to have been born in 1501. His father was a Lyonnese lawyer and municipal officer who served as Lyon&#x27;s ambassador to the court upon the accession of François I to the throne, giving the family a strong social standing in the city.

The Lyonnese school, of which Scève was the leader, included his friend Claude de Taillemont, Barthélemy Aneau, the physician Pierre Tolet and the women writers Jeanne Gaillarde—placed by Clément Marot on an equality with Christine de Pisan—Pernette du Guillet, Louise Labé, Clémence de Bourges and the poet&#x27;s sisters, Claudine and Sybille Scève.

==Work==

Scève&#x27;s first acclaim as a poet came in 1535, when he sent a pair of &quot;blasons&quot; to Marot in response to &quot;Le Blason du Beau Tétin&quot;. &quot;Le Sourcil&quot; (&quot;The Eyebrow&quot;) and &quot;La Larme&quot; (&quot;The Tear&quot;) were submitted as a part of a contest organized by Marot while in exile in Ferrara; the former was judged the winner, gaining notoriety for Scève in both France and Italy. These two poems were published along with others from the contest in 1536. Three additional Scève &quot;blasons&quot; (&quot;Le Front&quot;, &quot;La Gorge&quot; and &quot;Le Soupir&quot;) were published in the 1539 edition.

&quot;Délie&quot;, Scève&#x27;s most notable work, consists of 449 &quot;dizains&quot; (10-line epigrammes) preceded by a dedicatory &quot;huitain&quot; (8-line poem) to his mistress (&quot;A sa Délie&quot;). The title is sometimes understood to be an anagram for &quot;l&#x27;idée&quot; (&quot;the idea&quot;). &quot;Délie&quot; is the first French &quot;canzoniere&quot; or poetic collection modeled after Petrarch&#x27;s immensely-popular &quot;Canzoniere&quot;, a series of love poems addressed to a Lady.

Scève was also responsible for the translation of a sentimental novel, &quot;Grimalte y Gradissa&quot; by Juan de Flores, published as &quot;La Déplorable fin de Flamète&quot; in 1535, which was inspired by Giovanni Boccaccio.

Scève was a well versed musician as well as a poet; he cared very much for the musical value of the words he used, in this and in his erudition he forms a link between the school of Marot and the Pléiade.

==Further reading==

Important early literature on the poet includes Édouard Bourciez, &quot;La Littérature polie et les mœurs de cour sous Henri II&quot; (Paris, 1886); Jacques Pernetti, &quot;Recherches pour servir de l&#x27;histoire de Lyon&quot; (2 vols., Lyon, 1757), and especially F. Brunetière, &quot;&quot;Un Précurseur de la Pléiade, Maurice Scève&quot;,&quot; in his &quot;Etudes critiques&quot;, vol. vi. (1899).

More recent scholarship includes V. Saunier&#x27;s two-volume Sorbonne dissertation on the poet (Paris, 1948), as well as three excellent critical editions by Eugène Parturier (Paris, 1916, reissued 2001 with an introduction and bibliography by C. Alduy), I.D McFarlane (Cambridge, 1966) and Gérard Defaux (Geneva, 2004). McFarlane&#x27;s edition remains authoritative. Critical studies, with various approaches, by Dorothy Coleman, Jerry Nash, Nancy Frelick, Cynthia Skenazi, James Helgeson and Thomas Hunkeler are particularly useful; important articles on the poet have been written by François Rigolot, Enzo Giudici, Edwin Duval, Terence Cave, Gérard Defaux, and Richard Sieburth&#x27;s &quot;Introduction&quot; to &quot;Emblems of Desire: Selections from the &quot;Délie&quot;&quot;, a work which Sieburth translated and edited (see &quot;External links&quot; below for link to Sieburth&#x27;s &quot;Introduction&quot; available on-line).

A complete annotated bibliography of all works by and on Scève since his lifetime has recently been published (Cécile Alduy, &quot;Maurice Scève&quot;, Roma: Memini, 2006, 200pp.). It contains in particular all the critical literature, past and present, on Scève and his works.

<text>Thomas Muster (born 2 October 1967) is an Austrian former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Muster won 44 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including the 1995 French Open and eight Masters titles. One of the world&#x27;s leading clay court players in the 1990s, at his peak he was called &quot;The King of Clay&quot;. He is the first Austrian to win a major singles title, followed by Dominic Thiem at the 2020 US Open.

==Tennis career==
===Juniors===
Muster first came to prominence when he reached the final of the French Open junior tournament and the Orange Bowl juniors tournament in 1985.

===Pro tour===
Muster played his first matches at the top-level in 1984, as a junior player, at the age of 16. In 1984, he played his first match for Austria in the Davis Cup. He also played at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and in two tournaments on Austrian soil, the clay-court event in Kitzbühel and the indoor carpet event in Vienna.

Muster turned professional in 1985, regularly playing in Challenger tournaments throughout the year, winning in Belo Horizonte, as well as continuing to play in many top-level tournaments. Muster won his first top-level tournament at the Dutch Open in Hilversum in 1986.

In 1988, Muster reached six top-level tournament finals, winning four of them, in Boston, Bordeaux, Prague and Bari. Muster finished the year ranked 16th in the world.

Early in 1989, he became the first Austrian to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open, eventually losing in four sets to world No. 1, Ivan Lendl. Shortly after that, he became the first Austrian to reach the world top 10. On the night of 31 March 1989, he defeated Yannick Noah in five sets in the semifinals of the Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne, Florida, to set up a final against Lendl. However, in the early hours of 1 April 1989, just hours after his semifinal victory, he was struck by a drunk driver, severing ligaments in his left knee and forcing him to default the final. Muster flew back to Vienna to undergo surgery. With the aid of a special chair designed to allow him to practice hitting balls while recovering from knee surgery, he returned to competitive tennis in September 1989.

Muster&#x27;s comeback continued in 1990, when he won three top-level tournaments on clay (including the Italian Open, defeating Andrés Gómez in the semifinals and Andrei Chesnokov in the final) and one title on hardcourt. Muster reached the semifinals of the 1990 French Open, losing in straight sets to the eventual champion, Andrés Gómez. He also helped Austria reach the semifinals of the Davis Cup, where they were eliminated 3–2 by the United States, despite winning both of his singles rubbers against Michael Chang and Andre Agassi. That year, he was named the ATP Tour&#x27;s &quot;Comeback Player of the Year.&quot;

In 1990, Muster won the Austrian Sportsman of the Year award. He won two more top-level tournaments in 1991, and three more in 1992 (all on clay courts), with the biggest of these titles being the 1992 Monte Carlo title, where he defeated Aaron Krickstein in the final. In 1993, Muster won seven titles. Muster&#x27;s win–loss record on clay in 1993 was 55–10, although he failed to win any of the four big clay-court events of the year.

At both the 1992 and 1993 French Opens, Muster was defeated by the reigning French Open and Australian Open champion Jim Courier. At the 1994 French Open, he won his second round match against Andre Agassi in five sets but was then defeated by the serve-and-volley play of Patrick Rafter in the next round, with Rafter&#x27;s four set victory denying Muster a match against the reigning French Open champion Sergi Bruguera.

Muster won three clay-court titles in 1994. In March 1994, he defeated Michael Stich of Germany in a first round Davis Cup tie in Graz, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, 6–3, 12–10, after saving a match point when trailing at 7–8 in the fifth set. Despite Muster&#x27;s win over Stich bringing Austria level at 2–2 in the tie, it was Germany who eventually won the decisive fifth rubber.

In 1995, Muster enjoyed the best year of his career winning 12 tournaments, with 11 of those tournaments won on clay-courts. Between February and June 1995, Muster won 40 consecutive matches on clay (the longest winning streak on the surface since Björn Borg had won 46 matches between 1977 and 1979). At the 1995 Monte Carlo Masters, he defeated Andrea Gaudenzi in the semifinals, despite struggling heavily in the latter stages of the match due to having a shortage of glucose in his blood and suffering a 40° fever, which required a brief spell in hospital after the match. The next day, he won the final against Boris Becker, after a tough match, by 4–6, 5–7, 6–1, 7–6, 6–0, with Muster surviving two championship points in the fourth set tiebreak, the first of which saw Becker double-faulting after going for a big second serve. He went on to win his second Italian Open title, defeating Sergi Bruguera in the final. At the 1995 French Open, Muster won his first and only Grand Slam singles title, defeating Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the semifinals and comfortably beating 1989 champion Michael Chang in the final. Muster was the only Austrian to win a Grand Slam singles title until Dominic Thiem won the 2020 US Open. His win–loss record on clay in 1995 was a remarkable 65–2. Although his record on other surfaces was less impressive, a late season victory over Pete Sampras on fast indoor carpet during his run to the title of the 1995 Eurocard Open (October) – Singles Masters event in Essen, Germany, gave Muster an outside chance at finishing the year no. 1; however, Sampras finished the year at no. 1. Of the 12 tournaments that Muster won in 1995, he saved at least one match point held against him during six of them, with those six tournaments being held in Estoril, Barcelona, Monte Carlo, St. Pölten, Stuttgart Outdoor and Umag.

In 1995, Muster won the Austrian Sportsman of the Year award for the second time. He continued to rack up clay-court victories in 1996. He won seven tournaments, six of them titles he successfully defended after winning them the year before. These 1996 tournament victories included his third Monte Carlo title, where he defeated clay court specialist Albert Costa in the final, and his third Italian Open title, defeating Richard Krajicek in the final. Muster&#x27;s win–loss record on clay in 1996 was an impressive 46–3. This made his 1995–96 record on the surface 111–5, which was, at the time, the best two-year clay-court record since the open era began in 1968. Despite Muster&#x27;s continued dominance on clay-courts in 1996, he was upset in the Round of 16 at the 1996 French Open, losing to eventual finalist Michael Stich in four sets. In July 1996, in the final of the 1996 Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, Muster defeated newly crowned French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov in three straight sets.

In February 1996, Muster attained the world no. 1 ranking for the first time. He held the ranking initially for just one week, and then regained it for five weeks over March and April 1996. The validity of Muster&#x27;s number one ranking was called into question by top Americans Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, who argued that he had achieved the top spot based almost solely on his clay court results, although Muster had beaten Sampras on indoor carpet at the 1995 Masters event in Essen, Germany, and Agassi had only won tournaments on hardcourt in 1995.

In 1997, Muster enjoyed the best results of his career on hardcourt. He reached the semifinals of the 1997 Australian Open, losing to eventual champion Pete Sampras. He then went on to win the tournament in Dubai, defeating Goran Ivanišević in the final. Following a semifinal showing at the 1997 Newsweek Champions Cup and the State Farm Evert Cup in Indian Wells, California, Muster won his biggest title on hardcourt at the 1997 Miami Masters, the same tournament where his career had nearly ended eight years earlier. After a semifinal victory over Jim Courier—his third successive win over the American in early 1997—Muster defeated Sergi Bruguera in three straight sets in the final. Bruguera had defeated Sampras in the semifinals.

In August 1997, Muster made a hard-fought run to the championship round of the Cincinnati Masters before losing the final to Sampras. Having reached the semifinals or better in four of the five most important hard court events of the season to date, Muster was one of the favorites at the 1997 US Open – Men&#x27;s singles. However, as the fifth seed, Muster received a difficult first round draw and fell in four sets to Great Britain&#x27;s Tim Henman, then ranked world no. 21. Muster played decently indoors during the fall of 1997, reaching the semifinals of the 1997 IPB Czech Indoor in Ostrava, Czech Republic, and the quarterfinals of the 1997 Paris Open. As an injury-replacement alternate, the Austrian made his fourth and final appearance in the ATP&#x27;s year-end tournament, the 1997 ATP Tour World Championships – Singles, losing his lone match to Carlos Moyá. Muster finished 1997 ranked world no. 9.

For the season, Muster achieved a 29–8 win–loss record on hardcourt, but he only won nine out of 18 matches on clay. Muster&#x27;s 1997 French Open campaign ended in the third round when unseeded Gustavo Kuerten, then ranked at 66 in the world, defeated him in five sets despite Muster holding a 3–0 lead in the fifth set. Kuerten went on to win the 1997 French Open title and usher in a new era on clay.

With a renewed focus on clay and the 1998 French Open, Muster enjoyed a better April and May than he had the year prior. A strong run to the semifinals on the hard courts of Indian Wells—where he beat top-ranked Sampras along the way—in March 1998 buoyed Muster onto the European clay. In his next event and first clay appearance of 1998, Muster reached the last top-level tournament final of his career in Estoril, losing to Alberto Berasategui in three sets.

In early May 1998, Muster defeated sixth-ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov en route to the quarterfinals of the 1998 ATP German Open in Hamburg, Germany. At the 1998 French Open, Muster scored several nice wins to reach the quarterfinals before losing to Félix Mantilla in four sets, with Mantilla getting revenge for his contentious 1998 Italian Open defeat to Muster a few weeks prior.

Muster&#x27;s 1998 results faded after the spring, and he reached just one semifinal (Mallorca) and one quarterfinal (Boston) for the remainder of the year. Muster opened 1999 with a semifinal showing in Sydney before struggling over the next few months, winning just two of his 12 matches after Sydney. Following his first-round loss to Nicolás Lapentti at the 1999 French Open, Muster quietly disappeared from the ATP Tour at the age of 31. Muster remains the only world no. 1 singles player who never managed to win a men&#x27;s singles match at Wimbledon throughout his whole career (only made four appearances).

Muster only lost one Davis Cup singles match on clay in his career, when Goran Ivanišević defeated him in April 1997, 6–7, 7–5, 6–7, 6–2, 7–5, despite Muster having won 112 of his previous 117 matches on clay going into the match. Muster&#x27;s overall Davis Cup win–loss record, counting both singles and doubles matches, was 45–18. Muster&#x27;s win–loss record in Davis Cup singles matches was 36–8, while his win–loss record in Davis Cup singles matches on clay was 29–1. Muster has more match wins in Davis Cup than any other Austrian tennis player.

After he stopped playing tennis after the 1999 French Open, Muster moved to Noosa Heads, Australia, where he had officially resided since 1996, and married television presenter Jo Beth Taylor in 2000. The couple have a son, Christian, who was born in 2001. Muster and Taylor separated in 2002 and divorced in 2005. In 2003, Muster moved back to Austria, to work as a coach and captain of the Austrian Davis Cup team. He has played tennis on the ATP Champions Tour. In April 2010, Muster married Caroline Ofner, and they have a daughter, Maxim, who was born in 2009.

On 16 June 2010, at the age of 42, Muster announced his comeback to professional tennis. In July 2010, he played the first match of his comeback in a Challenger tournament in Braunschweig, where he lost in the first round. He went on to play in three Challenger tournaments in Kitzbühel, Como, and Rijeka. Eventually, in his fifth Challenger tournament in Ljubljana, Muster won his first comeback match, against Borut Puc of Croatia, which brought Muster back into the ATP singles ranking list at world number 988. Muster finished 2010 ranked at world number 980.

On 13 September 2011, Muster won a second match after his comeback, in the Todi Challenger, against the fifth seeded Argentinian Leonardo Mayer. His next opponent was countryman Martin Fischer, to whom Muster lost. On 19 September 2011, Muster reached world No. 847. He then lost his next match, at the Challenger tournament in Palermo, to Alessio di Mauro.

In October 2011, at the age of 44, Muster decided that he would play his last tennis match before retirement at the top-level Vienna tournament, where Muster lost to countryman, Dominic Thiem, in straight sets. However, three weeks after playing in Vienna, Muster was back again, this time in a Challenger tournament in Salzburg, playing against Dennis Blömke. He lost a close three-set battle. This was his last match to date.

== Records ==
In the 1995 season, Muster won 12 men&#x27;s singles tournament titles, a record for the ATP Tour (since 1990). In 2006 Roger Federer tied the record.

Muster has the highest winning percentage of singles tournament finals of all players who reached a minimum of 25 finals. Of his 55 finals, he won 44 with 11 defeats (80%).

<doc id="166171" wikidata="Q3425786" url="?curid=166171" title="River Etherow">
<text>The River Etherow in northern England is a tributary of the River Goyt. Although now passing through South Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Greater Manchester, it historically formed the ancient county boundary between Cheshire and Derbyshire. The upper valley is known as Longdendale. The river has a watershed of approximately , and the area an annual rainfall of .

==Course==

Rising in the Redhole Spring and Wike Head area of Pikenaze Moor in Derbyshire, the river broadens into the Longdendale Chain of reservoirs in the Peak District National Park. It emerges again in Tintwistle, Derbyshire, at the foot of Bottoms Reservoir dam and passes Melandra Castle in Gamesley, where it is joined by Glossop Brook. The Etherow enters the borough of Tameside at Hollingworth in Greater Manchester, passing into Stockport where it passes through Etherow Country Park. It flows into the River Goyt at Brabyns Park near Marple.

The modern accepted start of the River Mersey is at the confluence of the Tame and Goyt, in central Stockport, downstream. However, older definitions, and many older maps, place its start at the confluence of the Etherow and Goyt; for example the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica states &quot;It is formed by the junction of the Goyt and the Etherow a short distance below Marple in Cheshire on the first-named stream.&quot; John Stockdale&#x27;s map published on 12 April 1794 shows the Mersey River extending to at least Mottram, and forming the boundary between Cheshire and Derbyshire.

==Natural history==

The upper reaches of the River Etherow pass through peat moorland, inhabited by red foxes, voles and an introduced population of mountain hare. Red grouse, ring ouzel, wheatear and golden plover may be seen. Kestrels, merlins and short-eared owls nest here. The reservoirs attract mallards, and also teal, pochard, common sandpipers, black-headed gulls and Canada geese. The woodlands are home to redstart, great spotted woodpecker, and spotted flycatcher. Water rail have been recorded at Etherow Country Park.

==Geology==

Longdendale is a steep-sided V-shaped valley that is glacial in origin. Longdendale is in the Dark Peak, where a thick blanket of peat overlies the Millstone Grit sandstone, formed on a bed of shale through which flows the Etherow. Directly beneath the upper valley lie areas of Carboniferous Millstone Grit, shales and sandstone. It is on the edge of the Peak District Dome, at the southern edge of the Pennine anticline. The Variscan uplift has caused much faulting and Glossopdale was the product of glacial action in the last glaciation period that exploited the weakened rocks. The steep-sided valleys of the cloughs cause significant erosion and deposition. The layers of sandstone, mudstones and shale in the bedrock act as an aquifer to feed the springs. The valley bottoms have a thin deposit of boulder clay. The brooks are fed by the peaty soils of the moors and are, therefore, acidic (pH5.5–7.0).

==History==
The Etherow valley was an important trans-Pennine route, and in AD 78 the Romans under Agricola built the fort of Ardotalia (later known as Melandra or Melandra Castle) to defend it. The Mercians settled at Hollingworth about 650 AD. Many placenames of the area date from this period; for example, Mottram and Glossop. At the time of Domesday (1086) the river was firmly established as the boundary between Cheshire and Derbyshire, but the name &quot;Edrow&quot; or &quot;Etherow&quot; applied to this upper reach of the Mersey cannot be dated earlier than &quot;c&quot;.1772.
A packhorse route (known as a saltway) was maintained from the Middle Ages onwards to allow the export of salt from the Cheshire towns of Nantwich, Northwich and Middlewich across the Pennines. The saltway followed the Etherow to Ladyshaw, and at Salters Brook () it forked, with one route leading to Wakefield and another to Barnsley.

Water was an important source of power for industry, and the Etherow and its tributaries were fast flowing and constant. Watermills were used to grind meal and to full woollen cloth (Littlemoor 1781). Wool was transported along the turnpike road (1731) that ran from Ashton-under-Lyne, Stalybridge, Mottram, Woodhead and Lady&#x27;s Cross to Sheffield, to be woven on hand-looms in the dale.

From 1782 to 1820, water-powered cotton mills were built along many brooks feeding the Etherow, including six on the Glossop side of the river. With the adoption of steam to power the ever-larger mills, built closer to the coal fields, the river assumed a new role as a source of water for Manchester and Salford. In 1844 John Frederick Bateman advised Manchester Corporation that the River Etherow, which rose at the highest point of the Pennine chain, could provide water, collected in purpose-built reservoirs, &quot;nearly as pure as if it comes from the heavens.&quot; This led to the construction of the Longdendale Chain of reservoirs, the first scheme of its type in the world. Three reservoirs were built on the Etherow to impound drinking water, with another two to provide compensation water for the mills downstream.

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Etherow&quot; could be of Brittonic Celtic origin and derived from the ancient term &quot;*ador&quot;, meaning &quot;watercourse, channel&quot;. The settlement-name Tintwistle, however, implies that &quot;Etherow&quot; may be an Old English replacement for an earlier name of the &quot;*Tin-&quot; type (see River Tyne), derived from the hydronym &quot;*edre&quot;, which is possibly related to &quot;ēdre&quot;, &quot;vein&quot;.

==Economy==

The Longdendale Chain of reservoirs comprises three impounding reservoirs, Woodhead Reservoir, Torside Reservoir and Rhodeswood Reservoir, supplying of water a day by gravity to Manchester and Salford, and to Hyde and Denton through the Mottram tunnel. Valehouse Reservoir and Bottoms Reservoir are compensating reservoirs which have a combined holding capacity of .

===Woodhead railway line===

The Woodhead Line, which followed the river from Hadfield to the Woodhead Tunnel portal, was an important cross-Pennine route built in 1844 by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway. Three tunnels of were dug, connecting Woodhead with Dunford Bridge on the River Don. Though now closed to railway traffic, one tunnel is used to route electricity cables for the National Grid, with work in progress to use a second tunnel for a new cable, thus preventing the re-establishment of rail traffic.

==Recreation==

===Walking and cycling===

Following the closure of the railway line, the trackbed was taken up and the Longdendale Trail constructed along its route. This is now part of the Trans-Pennine Trail, Sustrans National Cycle Route 62. This, in its turn, is part of the European walking route E8 from Liverpool to Istanbul. The Pennine Way crosses Longdendale, descending from Bleaklow to the south and ascending Black Hill to the north. The youth hostel at Crowden is a traditional stop after the first day&#x27;s walking, from Edale.

The circular walk known as &#x27;The Longdendale Edges&#x27; takes in the high ground (at about the - level) on both sides of the valley. It is about long and is &#x27;not recommended in doubtful weather&#x27;. The detailed route, clockwise from Crowden Youth Hostel, is given in &quot;Peak District Walking Guide No.2&quot;, published by the Peak Park Planning Board.

===Sailing===
Torside Reservoir is home to Glossop &amp; District Sailing Club and Etherow Country Park is the home to Etherow Country Park Sailing Club.

===Country Park===

Etherow Country Park, in Compstall, close to the mouth of the Etherow, opened in 1968 as one of the UK&#x27;s first country parks. Originally it was an industrial area incorporating a mine, a mill and a mill pond. The River Etherow flows through the park and is the source for the mill pond. Etherow Country Park is associated with many local groups, including a small local community group, the Friends of Etherow, anglers, the afore-mentioned sailing club, and a model boat club.

Compstall Nature Reserve is a region of the park which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The area was given the designation in 1977 for its biological interest, in particular its wide range of habitats, including open water, tall fen, reed swamp, carr and mixed deciduous woodland.

<text>Stalybridge () is a town in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England. At the 2021 census, it had a population of 26,830.

Historically divided between Cheshire and Lancashire, it is east of Manchester and north-west of Glossop.

When a water-powered cotton mill was constructed in 1776, Stalybridge became one of the first centres of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The wealth created in the 19th century from the factory-based cotton industry transformed an area of scattered farms and homesteads into a self-confident town.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest evidence of human activity in Stalybridge is a flint scraper from the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age. Also bearing testament to the presence of man in prehistory are the Stalybridge cairns. The two monuments are on the summit of Hollingworthall Moor apart. One of the round cairns is the best-preserved Bronze Age monument in Tameside, and is protected as a scheduled monument. A branch of the Roman road between the forts at Manchester (&quot;Mamucium&quot;) and Melandra Castle (&quot;Ardotalia&quot;) is thought to run through Stalybridge to the fort of Castleshaw.

The settlement was originally called Stavelegh, which derives from the Old English &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;wood where the are got&quot;. The medieval Lords of the manor took &quot;de Stavelegh&quot; as their name, later becoming &quot;Stayley&quot; or &quot;Staley&quot;. The lordship of Longdendale was one of the ancient feudal estates of Cheshire and included the area of Stalybridge. Buckton Castle, near Stalybridge, was probably built by one of the earls of Chester in the 12th century. William de Neville was the first lord of Longdendale, appointed by the Earl of Chester between 1162 and 1186. The lordship of Longdendale included the manors of Staley, Godley, Hattersley, Hollingworth, Matley, Mottram, Newton, Tintwistle and Werneth; the manor of Staley was first mentioned between 1211 and 1225.

The first records of the de Stavelegh family as Lords of the Manor of Staley date from the early 13th century. Staley Hall was their residence. The present hall was built in the late 16th century on the same site as an earlier hall of the Stayley family which dated from before 1343.

Sir Ralph Staley (descendant of the de Stavelegh family) had no male heirs but an only daughter, Elizabeth Staley, who married Sir Thomas Assheton and united the manors of Ashton and Staley. Elizabeth and Thomas had two daughters and no sons. Margaret, the eldest of their two daughters, married Sir William Booth of Dunham Massey. The younger daughter Elizabeth was widowed and without children, and continued to live at Staley Hall until her death in 1553. In her will her share of the lordships of Staley and Ashton were left to the Booths.

The manor of Staley remained in the possession of the Booth family until the death of George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington on 2 August 1758. Upon his death, the Earldom of Warrington became extinct. His only daughter, Lady Mary Booth, the wife of Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford, inherited all the Booth estates. The manor of Staley was owned by the Grey family until the extinction of the Earldom of Stampford on the death of Roger Grey, 10th Earl of Stamford in 1976. At this point, the family estates were dispersed. Stamford Street, Grey Street, Groby Street, Stamford Park, Stamford Golf Club and the two Stamford Arms public houses in Stalybridge are all named after the Grey family.

===Industrial Revolution===

As Stayley expanded in the 18th century, it reached the banks of the River Tame. After the construction of a bridge in 1707, the settlement was commonly referred to as Stalybridge, meaning the bridge at Stayley. By the mid-18th century Stalybridge had a population of just 140. Farming and woolen spinning were the main means of subsistence at this time.

In 1776, the town&#x27;s first water-powered mill for carding and spinning cotton was built at Rassbottom. In 1789, the town&#x27;s first spinning mill using the principle of Arkwright&#x27;s Water Frame was built. By 1793, steam power had been introduced to the Stalybridge cotton industry; by 1803 there were eight cotton mills in the growing town containing 76,000 spindles. The Huddersfield Narrow Canal was completed in 1811 and still runs through the town.

The rapid growth of industry in Stalybridge was due to the introduction of machinery. This was, however, met with violent opposition. After the arrival of the Luddites in the area the doors of mills were kept locked day and night. Military aid was requested by the mill owners and a Scottish regiment under the Duke of Montrose was sent to the town. It was led by Captain Raines who made his headquarters at the Roe Cross Inn. Gangs of armed men destroyed power looms and fired mills. The disturbances in Stalybridge culminated with a night of violent rioting on 20 April 1812.

The social unrest did not curb the growth of Stalybridge. By 1814, there were twelve factories and, by 1818, the number had increased to sixteen. The Industrial Revolution led to a rapid increase in the town&#x27;s population in the early part of the 19th century. The population of the town by 1823 was 5,500. In the following two years, partly because of an influx of Irish families seeking better wages, the population rose to 9,000. Stalybridge was among the first wave of towns to establish a Mechanics&#x27; Institute with a view to educating the growing number of workers. Only a year after the establishment of Manchester Mechanics&#x27; Institute, Stalybridge founded an Institute of its own. Its doors opened on 7 September 1825 on Shepley Street with a reading room on Queen Street.

On 9 May 1828, the Stalybridge Police and Market Act received Royal Assent, establishing Stalybridge as an independent town with a board of 21 Commissioners. Every male over the age of 21 who was the occupier of a rateable property under the act was entitled to vote at the election of the Commissioners. On 30 December 1831, Stalybridge Town Hall was officially opened. In 1833, the Commissioners set up the Stalybridge Police Force, the first of its kind in the country. By this year, the population of the town had reached 14,216 with 2.357 inhabited houses.

In 1834, a second bridge was built over the Tame. It was downstream of Staley Bridge and constructed of iron.

The second Chartist petition was presented to Parliament in April 1842. Stalybridge contributed 10,000 signatures. After the rejection of the petition the first general strike began in the coal mines of Staffordshire. The second phase of the strike originated in Stalybridge. A movement of resistance to the imposition of wage cuts in the mills, also known as the Plug Riots, it spread to involve nearly half a million workers throughout Britain and represented the biggest single exercise of working class strength in 19th century Britain. On 13 August 1842, there was a strike at Bayley&#x27;s Cotton Mill in Stalybridge and roving cohorts of operatives carried the stoppage first to the whole area of Stalybridge and Ashton, then to Manchester, and subsequently to towns adjacent to Manchester, using as much force as was necessary to bring mills to a standstill. The movement remained, to outward appearances, largely non-political. Although the People&#x27;s Charter was praised at public meetings, the resolutions that were passed at these were in almost all cases merely for a restoration of the wages of 1820, a ten-hour working day, or reduced rents.

In writing &quot;The Condition of The Working Class in England&quot; (1844), Friedrich Engels used Stalybridge as an example:

... multitudes of courts, back lanes, and remote nooks arise out of [the] confused way of building ... Add to this the shocking filth, and the repulsive effect of Stalybridge, in spite of its pretty surroundings, may be readily imagined.

John Summers first established an iron forge in Stalybridge in the 1840s. Later, he and his sons developed this into a major business and employed over 1,000 local men in their factory, the largest in the town.

The Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway Company was formed on 19 July 1844 and the railway was connected to Stalybridge on 5 October 1846. On 9 July 1847, the company was acquired by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. On 1 August 1849, the Manchester, Stockport and Leeds Railway connected Stalybridge to Huddersfield and later to Stockport. This line later became part of the London and North Western Railway.

====The cotton famine====
On the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the Stalybridge cotton mills rapidly ran short of cotton. Thousands of operatives were laid off. In October 1862, a meeting was held in Stalybridge Town Hall that passed a resolution blaming the Confederate States of America and their actions in the American Civil War, rather than U.S. blockades of seaports, for the cotton famine in Lancashire. By the winter of 1862–63, there were 7,000 unemployed operatives in the town. Only five of the town&#x27;s 39 factories and 24 machine shops were employing people full-time. Contributions were sent from all over the world for the relief of the cotton operatives in Lancashire; and at one point three-quarters of Stalybridge workers were dependent on relief schemes. By 1863, there were 750 empty houses in the town. A thousand skilled men and women left the town, in what became known as &quot;The Panic&quot;.

In 1863, the relief committee decided to substitute a system of relief by ticket instead of money. The tickets were to be presented at local grocery shops. An organised resistance was organised culminating on Friday 20 March 1863.
In 1867, Stalybridge was disturbed by the arrival of William Murphy. Records of this man indicate that his sole interest was to sow the seeds of dissent between Roman Catholics, who by this time had grown to significant proportions, and Protestants. He succeeded in this goal only too well for a full year. During 1868, there were a number of violent disturbances and rioting created by this man who described himself as a &quot;renegade Roman Catholic&quot;. In his lectures to the public, &quot;pretending to expose the religious practices of the Roman Catholic Church&quot;, he became a master at whipping up a crowd into a frenzy. Newspaper reports of the time told of his common practice of waving a revolver in the air in &quot;a most threatening manner&quot;. On one occasion, he incited a riot of such proportions that Fr. Daley, the parish priest of St. Peter&#x27;s, took to the roof of the church to defend it. A man was shot. The parish priest was tried but eventually acquitted at the Quarter Sessions. Following this incident, the community began to settle down and Murphy chose to extend his political activities elsewhere.

In 1867, the Victoria Bridge on Trinity Street was built. Victoria Market Hall was constructed in 1868 and the public baths were opened in May 1870. The baths were presented as a gift to the town by philanthropists and benefactors Robert Platt (1802–1882), born in Stalybridge, and his wife Margaret Platt (1819–1888), born in Salford.

Stalybridge Borough Band was formed in March 1871, holding its first rehearsals and meetings at the Moulder&#x27;s Arms, Grasscroft Street, Castle Hall. The band was known as the 4th Cheshire Rifleman Volunteers (Borough Band) until 1896. The founder and first conductor was Alexander Owen, who conducted the band until at least 1907.

===20th century===
The character of Stalybridge altered over the 20th century. At the turn of the century, the cotton industry was still strong, and the population of the town reached its peak in 1901, at 27,623, but as trade dwindled the population began to decline, and despite the intensified employment of the war years, the main industry of Stalybridge continued to fail.
There were floods in Millbrook in May 1906.

Mrs Ada Summers was elected first woman mayor of Stalybridge in November 1919. At that time, mayors of boroughs were justices, as well as chairmen of borough benches, by right of office. However, it was not until the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 came into force on 23 December 1919 that women could become magistrates. Sitting ex-officio Ada Summers became the first woman magistrate in the country and was sworn in on 31 December. Ada Summers was, probably, the first woman to officially adjudicate in court. Ada Summers photo appeared in the weekly journal &quot;Great Thoughts&quot;, 5 June 1920, alongside an interview on &quot;The First Woman JP&quot; on her work. Ada Summers was the widow of a local ironmaster. She was an active suffragist and Liberal and used her wealth and position to support a number of schemes designed to improve conditions in the town. These included a maternity and child welfare clinic, clinics for the sick and poor and an unofficial employment centre. She later became an alderman and was appointed MBE. On 31 May 1939 she was awarded the Honorary Freedom of the Borough.

In 1929, with no room for expansion at Stalybridge, the Summers sheet rolling and galvanising plants were transferred to Shotton in North Wales, having devastating effects on local employment; the new plant later became a component in the British Steel Corporation. By 1932, seven of the town&#x27;s largest mills had closed and unemployment reached 7,000. In 1934, the borough council set up an Industrial Development Committee for the purpose of encouraging new industries to settle in the town. The committee purchased Cheetham&#x27;s Mill and rented it out to small firms engaged in a wide variety of enterprises. By 1939, unemployment in the town had almost disappeared.

====1939–2000====
Stalybridge experienced intensive black-out periods and frequent air-raid warning during the Second World War. Bombs dropped by enemy aircraft mainly landed in open country and there were no civilian casualties. On 19 July 1946, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Stalybridge. The town&#x27;s war memorial was extended after the war, to bear the names of an extra 124 men from the town; it was unveiled on 23 April 1950.

In the post-war period council housing was provided by the local authority as separate council estates. The Buckton Vale estate was built between January 1950 and March 1953, and the Stamford Park estate between January 1953 and January 1955; the Copley estate commenced building in August 1954 and the Ridgehill estate in January 1956.

In 1955, after the adoption of the first post-war slum clearance plan, new housing estates were built to replace the slums and, gradually, redundant textile mills were occupied by firms in the various light industries. New applications of engineering principles, the manufacture of rubber goods, plastics, chemicals and packaging materials were all introduced, as well as the addition of synthetic fibres to the textile trade, reducing unemployment. The plastics industry origin and growth are described by Craig and Bowes in &quot;Cotton Mills to Chemical Plants&quot; (2013).

The early 1970s saw the development of private semi-detached and detached housing estates, particularly in the Mottram Rise, Hough Hill, Hollins and Carrbrook areas; the redevelopment of Castle Hall was also completed. The construction of the Buckton Vale overspill estate also took place in the early 1970s.

The early 1980s saw the closure of the public baths after the completion of Copley Recreation Centre. One of the symbols of the late-19th century civic improvement, the baths were subsequently demolished.

In 1991, for the first time since 1901, there was an increase in the population of Stalybridge to 22,295. The 1990s saw the proliferation of Mock Tudor style estates at Moorgate and along Huddersfield Road, close to Staley Hall; this continued into the 21st century with the completion of the Crowswood estate in Millbrook.

===21st century===

The Huddersfield Narrow Canal, which had been culverted in the early 1970s, was reinstated to the town centre between 1999 and May 2001 as part of a two-year multimillion-pound refurbishment. The canal now runs under the legs of an electricity pylon. The market hall closed on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999 and became the Civic Hall in 2001. Four years later, the area designated for retail space became exhibition space. There were plans to reopen the market and let the retail hall out to private contractors, though this came to naught. The town&#x27;s cinema, the Palace, closed on 31 August 2003, with the last film being &quot;American Pie 3: The Wedding&quot;. The cinema has since been converted to become Rififi Nightclub and Amber Lounge Bar &amp; Restaurant, which itself was closed down late in 2012 after two violent incidents on the same night.

In 2004, the Metropolitan Borough Council announced that they had granted permission for a developer to build 16 homes next to Staley Hall. A condition of the planning consent was that the hall be restored. As of 2008, the hall is still deteriorating. It is now listed as being in &quot;very bad&quot; condition on the English Heritage buildings at risk register. As of 2015 Staley Hall has been renovated and redeveloped into apartments.

Stalybridge suffered from Storm Angus on 21 November 2016 when of rain fell on Tameside in five hours. Mottram Road and Huddersfield Road, Millbrook were flooded by water from a stream leading from the Walkerwood Reservoir.

In late June 2018, many properties in Stalybridge were threatened by a large wildfire advancing from Saddleworth Moor. 50 properties in the Carrbrook area of Stalybridge were evacuated on 26 June as the wildfire advanced towards them.

In December 2023, during Storm Gerrit, a tornado caused damage in the Millbrook and Carrbrook areas of Stalybridge.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Stalybridge, at metropolitan borough level: Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester.

===Administrative history===
As the town developed during the industrial revolution, it initially straddled two counties and three parishes: the township of Dukinfield in the parish of Stockport and the township of Stayley in the parish of Mottram in Longdendale in Cheshire, and the parish of Ashton-under-Lyne in Lancashire. Townships such as Dukinfield and Stayley were reclassified as civil parishes in 1866.
In 1828, a body of improvement commissioners was established to administer a newly-defined Stalybridge district, which straddled the townships of Dukinfield, Stayley, and Ashton-under-Lyne. In 1857, the commissioners&#x27; district was incorporated to become a municipal borough.
The town&#x27;s municipal charter established a council comprising a mayor, six aldermen and eighteen councillors. The borough was divided into three wards: Lancashire; Staley and Dukinfield. A list of burgesses was published on 21 April 1857 and the first election of councillors was held on 1 May 1857. The contesting parties were the &quot;whites&quot; and the &quot;yellows&quot;. The council met for the first time on 9 May 1857 and elected the first six aldermen. The first mayor was William Bayley. The council took over the commissioners&#x27; functions in January 1858.

The new borough council was granted a coat of arms later in 1857. The arms incorporated features from the coats of arms of the Stayley, Assheton, Dukinfield and Astley families who had all been land owners in the town. The motto, &quot;absque labore nihil&quot;, means &quot;nothing without labour&quot;.

Stayley township also included extensive areas outside the original borough boundaries of Stalybridge. The northern tip of Stayley township was included in the local government district of Mossley in 1864. In 1868, a separate Stayley local government district was created covering the parts of the township that were neither in the Mossley district nor the borough of Stalybridge, with Millbrook being the largest settlement in the Stayley district. The borough of Stalybridge was enlarged in 1881 to take in the area of the Stayley local government district, which was abolished, plus further parts of the parish of Ashton-under-Lyne, including Heyrod and Ridge Hill.

When elected county councils were established in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, boroughs such as Stalybridge which straddled county boundaries were placed entirely in the county which had the majority of the population. The part of Stalybridge north of the River Tame in Lancashire was therefore transferred to Cheshire. Parish boundaries were not changed by the 1889 county boundary alteration. In 1894 a new civil parish of Stalybridge was created which covered the same area as the borough. The borough was enlarged in 1936 to take in part of the abolished parish of Matley, formerly part of the Tintwistle Rural District.

In 1955, Stalybridge was twinned with Armentières, France.
The borough of Stalybridge was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester.

===Parliamentary representation===

As a county palatine Cheshire was unrepresented in Parliament until the Chester and Cheshire (Constituencies) Act 1542. From 1545 Cheshire was represented by two Knights of the Shire. On the passage of the Great Reform Act of 1832, the area of Stalybridge south of the Tame was included in the North Cheshire constituency.

Between the passing of the Second Reform Act in 1867, and the general election of 1918, the town was represented in its own right through the Stalybridge Borough constituency. Since the 1918 general election the town has been represented in Parliament by the member for the Stalybridge and Hyde county constituency. The current Member of Parliament is Jonathan Reynolds, a former Tameside Councillor.

==Geography==
At (53.483, −2.040) Stalybridge lies in the foothills of the Pennines, straddling the River Tame. The river forms part of the ancient boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire. On the boundary of the Peak District national park. The highest point in the town is the summit of Wild Bank at . Harridge Pike is the second highest peak at . Buckton Hill, the site of the mediaeval Buckton Castle, is another prominent landmark. The town centre itself is situated along the banks of the river between Ridge Hill to the north and Hough Hill to the south. Stalybridge Weather Station is staffed by volunteers and has been providing statistics since 1999. The local bedrock is millstone grit, covered by a thin layer of soil over clay, with surface rock outcrops.

Over the course of the 20th century the population of the town declined, after the demolition of the mid-19th century high-density housing. At the 2001 census Stalybridge had a population of 22,568. The town includes the localities of Heyheads, Buckton Vale, Carrbrook, Millbrook, Brushes Estate, Copley, Mottram Rise, Woodlands, Matley, Hough Hill, Castle Hall, Hollins Street, Hydes, Rassbottom, Waterloo, Cocker Hill, the Hague, Springs, Ridge Hill and Heyrod.


==Demography==
According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Stalybridge had a population of 22,568. The 2001 population density was , with a 100 to 95.0 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 29.2% were single (never married) and 41.6% married. Stalybridge&#x27;s 9,331 households included 29.1% one-person, 38.3% married couples living together, 9.7% were co-habiting couples, and 12.0% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 31.7% had no academic qualifications, below the average for Tameside (35.2%) but slightly higher than England (28.9%).

==Environment==

Much of the upland areas of the town are grouse moors. Boar Flat is part of the Dark Peak Site of Special Scientific Interest, as classified by Natural England. The slopes below the moors, particularly beneath Harridge Pike, are used for sheep grazing by the hill farms. The Stalybridge Country Park centres on two areas. Firstly, the Brushes Valley, with its four reservoirs running up into the Pennine Moors, and secondly Carrbrook, lying in the shadow of Buckton Castle. Linking the two areas, although outside the country park boundaries, is a good rights of way network, and areas of designated access land which take visitors into the Tame Valley, Longdendale and the Peak District. The country park affords views of the Cheshire Plain, Jodrell Bank and on very clear days the mountains of Snowdonia. Buckton Castle and Stalybridge cairn, a round cairn, west of Hollingworthhall Moor are both scheduled monuments.
The town&#x27;s two parks are the main open spaces in the town centre. Cheetham Park was opened in June 1932 to a crowd of 15,000 people. The park was left to the town under the will of John Frederick Cheetham along with his house, Eastwood, and his collection of paintings, which now form part of the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery collection. The park is landscaped informally with large areas of woodland. Adjacent to Cheetham&#x27;s Park lies the Eastwood Nature Reserve. Eastwood was one of the first reserves to be owned by the RSPB. It is managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve is a cut-over, lowland, raised mire SSSI, surrounded by a woodland fringe. Characteristic bog plants include sphagnum mosses, cotton grass and cross-leaved heath. Nine species of dragonfly and damselfly have been recorded on the reserve, along with the green hairstreak butterfly. The steep-sided broad-leaved woodland is bisected by Acres Brook and contains several old mill ponds. The geology is shale and sandstone, with a rich variety of plants and animals typical of woodland habitat on an acid soil. Access is from the A6018 Mottram Road. Car parking is available in Stalybridge Celtic FC&#x27;s car park. The reserve occupies .
Stamford Park is registered by English Heritage as being of special interest. In 1865, local mill owner Abel Harrison died and his home, Highfield House, and its extensive grounds, on the border with Ashton were bought by the two towns. Neighbouring land was donated by George Harry Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford and 3rd Earl of Warrington. The whole area was landscaped to become Stamford Park and opened by the Earl on 12 July 1873. The former mill reservoir, known as Chadwick Dams, was incorporated into the park in 1891. The reservoir was divided in two by an embankment, with the southern section becoming the present boating lake. This area includes waterfalls cascading over rock faces and gargoyles built into the bridges and walls. The park has tennis courts, bowling greens, a children&#x27;s playground, The park is the venue for the annual Tulip Sunday Festival.

==Culture==

===Music===
Stalybridge has an established musical tradition. Stalybridge Old Band was formed in 1809, perhaps the first civilian brass band in the world. The band currently contests in the second section. Carrbrook Brass currently contests in the fourth section and represent the town annually at the Armentières festival. An annual brass band contest has been held in the town on Whit Friday, since at least 1870. Other contests have been held on the same day in the surrounding villages of Millbrook, Carrbrook and Heyrod. There is now an established tradition of holding brass band contests on this day around Stalybridge, Mossley and Saddleworth. Bands travel by coach from all over the United Kingdom, and sometimes from other countries, to contest in as many different locations as possible on the day.
The song &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; was created in the Newmarket Tavern, by the composer Jack Judge, in 1912, after being challenged to write, compose, and produce a song in just one night;. It was first sung in public by him in the Grand Theatre on Corporation Street on 31 January 1912. On 31 January 1953 a memorial tablet was unveiled by Jack Hylton on the wall of the old Newmarket Tavern, where the song was composed. To coincide with the ceremony a wreath was laid on Jack Judge&#x27;s grave, by the mayor of Oldbury. Jack Judge is now also commemorated by a statue in Lord Pendry Square outside the Old Victoria Market Hall.

More recently a live folk music tradition has developed in the town. The Buffet Bar Folk Club meets every Saturday at 9 pm and the Free and Easy folk club meet at 9 pm on alternate Thursdays at the White House public house in the town centre. Some members of the Fivepenny Piece who sang traditional North Country music in the 1970s were from Stalybridge. and the band performed songs such as &quot;Stalybridge Station&quot; and &quot;Stalybridge Market&quot;. They also took &quot;In Bowton&#x27;s Yard&quot;, the work of local poet Samuel Laycock, and put it to music.

===Art===
Built as a gift to the town of Stalybridge by John Frederick Cheetham and his wife Beatrice Astley, the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery originally opened to the public as a lecture theatre on 14 January 1901. The space was turned into a gallery to house the Astley Cheetham Collection, bequeathed in 1932. This collection has grown with gifts and donations throughout the 20th century and is one of the most interesting small regional collections of 15th century Italian paintings. The collection of work by Italian old masters includes &#x27;Portrait of a Young Man&#x27; by Alessandro Allori. Also, British art of the 19th and 20th centuries is represented by artists such as John Linnell, Richard Parkes Bonington, George Price Boyce, Burne-Jones, Mark Gertler and Duncan Grant. Aske Hall by J. M. W. Turner is also part of the gallery&#x27;s collection. Alongside exhibitions of the collection, the gallery also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions by regional artists.

During the earlier part of the 20th century, Stalybridge was artistically captured by the painter L. S. Lowry. Some of his paintings were of the people of Stalybridge. Lowry continued painting pictures until his death in 1976. His house is marked with a blue plaque on Stalybridge Road, Mottram in Longdendale. There is also a statue of him, holding his sketch pad, on a bench near the Stalybridge Road bus stop. Sheila Vaughan is a Stalybridge artist working in oils and acrylic. Her work and that of other Stalybridge artists such as Keith Taylor are displayed at the Peoples Gallery on Melbourne Street.

The &quot;Lock Gates Sundial&quot; is a large piece of public art alongside the canal in Armentieres Square. It commemorates the reopening of the canal and was installed in 2008. The north facing balance beam forms the gnomon of the sundial, and heel stones mark the time.

===Literature===
As well as being described by Engels, Stalybridge was featured in Disraeli&#x27;s &quot;Coningsby&quot;. The children&#x27;s author Beatrix Potter visited Gorse Hall many times as a child as it was the home of her maternal grandmother. Samuel Laycock (1826–93) was a librarian at the Mechanics&#x27; Institute for two years. His poetry presents a vivid impression of the mid-19th century, working-class life, and he drew on his personal experience in the cotton industry. His best-loved poems are &quot;Bowton&#x27;s Yard&quot; and &quot;Bonny Brid&quot; – both written in Stalybridge. Tim Willocks, author of &quot;Bad City Blues&quot;, &quot;Green River Rising&quot; and &quot;Bloodstained Kings&quot; is from Stalybridge. Dolores Gordon-Smith, author of the &quot;Jack Haldean&quot; murder mystery series (published by Constable &amp; Robinson and currently by Severn House) and &quot;Frankies&#x27; Letter&quot; (on Kindle) is from Stalybridge and currently resides there. M. John Harrison describes Stalybridge in his short story &quot;The Ice Monkey&quot; as a place &quot;where nothing is clear-cut and there is neither town nor country, just a grim industrial muddle of the two&quot;.

===Traditions===

====Whit Friday====
Whit Friday is the name given to the first Friday after Whitsun in areas of northeast Cheshire, southeast Lancashire and the western fringes of Yorkshire. The day has a cultural significance in Stalybridge as the date on which the annual Whit Walks were traditionally held. It is also the day on which the traditional annual Whit Friday brass band contests are held.

====Wakes Week====
The wakes were originally religious festivals that commemorated church dedications. Particularly important was the Rushcart festival associated with Rogationtide. During the Industrial Revolution the tradition of the wakes was adapted into a regular summer break in the mill towns of Lancashire, where each locality would nominate a wakes week during which the cotton mills would all close at the same time. Stalybridge Wakes occurs in the third week of July. Wakes Week became the focus for fairs, and eventually for holidays where the mill workers would go to the seaside, eventually on the newly developing railways.

===Food and drink===
Stalybridge has the public house with the longest name in Britain – The Old Thirteenth Cheshire Astley Volunteer Rifleman Corps Inn, which closed in June 2016 but reopened in April 2019 – and also the one with the shortest, Q. The railway station is one of the last in Britain to retain its original buffet, the 1998 refurbishment of which won awards from CAMRA and English Heritage.

The restoration of the canal between 1999 and 2001 attracted new commercial ventures such as riverside cafés and boat trips. The reopening of the canal and the fact that the Tame runs through the town centre resulted in the nickname &quot;Little Venice&quot;. Stalybridge has in recent years acquired another nickname, &quot;Staly Vegas&quot;; the nickname became popular and was used ironically after the controversial conversion of premises in the shopping area into nightclubs and bars, the proliferation of takeaways and the refurbishment of some of the more traditional pubs.

The town&#x27;s traditional foods include Tater Hash (Potato Pie, or Meat and Potato Pie), a variation on Lancashire Hotpot, black peas, today mainly eaten on Whit Friday, and tripe. Stalybridge is the location of the region&#x27;s last remaining tripe shop.

===Media===
&quot;The Stalybridge Reporter&quot; weekly newspaper was established in 1855. With &quot;The North Cheshire Herald&quot; it now serves the wider district under the name &quot;The Tamesider Reporter&quot;.

==Religion==
Until the 18th century the Manor of Staley formed part of the parish of St Michael and All Angels, Mottram. The first church to be built in Stalybridge was Old St George&#x27;s Church, Cocker Hill which was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester on 25 July 1776. The church collapsed on 15 May 1778. After the Industrial Revolution, the rising population and the settlement of people from various parts of the country meant that Stalybridge became a centre for a wide range of denominations and sects. The history of these churches in the town is complex, with some churches having occupied many different sites. The influence of the churches in the town remained strong well into the 20th century and formed part of the basis of Stalybridge&#x27;s sense of identity.

The first Methodist chapel was erected in 1802 on the corner of Chapel Street and Rassbottom Street. The Baptist chapel on King Street, was opened by the Particular (Ebenezer) Baptists. This chapel was subsequently occupied by the Congregational Church on 3 October 1830. The Particular (Ebenezer) Baptists moved to a new chapel on Cross Leech Street on 28 October 1828.

===Churches===

;Church of England
St George&#x27;s is the parish church on the Lancashire side of the river in the Diocese of Manchester. It is known as New St George&#x27;s and its foundation stone was laid on 24 June 1840. On the Cheshire side, the parish church of Holy Trinity and Christ Church, Diocese of Chester, is on Trinity Street in the town centre, beside the former market hall. The foundation stone of the parish church of St Paul&#x27;s, Staley, was laid by Stapleton Stapleton-Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere on 2 February 1838. It is in the Diocese of Chester, as is St James&#x27;, Millbrook.
St Paul&#x27;s Church is on Huddersfield Road and is an active parish church.

;Roman Catholic
There are two Roman Catholic parishes – St Peter&#x27;s, Stalybridge, the foundation stone of which was laid on 8 June 1838, and St Raphael&#x27;s, Millbrook. In 2011 an estimated repair bill of £250,000 led to a decision to close St Raphael&#x27;s; a final Mass was held on 14 July 2011, and although it was Grade II listed in 2011, its future is now &quot;uncertain&quot;. Both parishes are in the Diocese of Shrewsbury.
;Methodist
The octagonal Stalybridge Methodist Church on High Street opened in 1966.

;Congregationalist
Stalybridge Congregational Church is to be found in a modern building on Baker Street, just off Acres Lane, behind the Organ public house. Its original building, which opened for worship in 1861 and was demolished around the turn of the 21st century, was between Melbourne Street and Trinity Street in the town centre.
;Unitarian
The Unitarian Church on Forester Drive was established in 1870 and is part of the East Cheshire Union of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches.
;Evangelical/Non-denominational
Stalybridge Revival Church, on Mount Street, formerly known as Stalybridge Evangelical Church, was established in 2009. The church has since moved to Millbrook but retains use of the building on Mount Street.

==Education==
Before 1910, primary education was provided by the church schools. In 1910 the borough opened its own school on Waterloo Road. In 1927, West Hill School, a central school for boys was opened. The central school for girls opened in 1930. Until 1980 secondary modern education was provided by schools in the town itself; and grammar school education by Hyde Grammar School. For Roman Catholic pupils, grammar school education was provided by Harrytown, Bredbury and Xaverian, Rusholme. Catholic secondary modern education was available from 1963 at St Peter and St Paul, Dukinfield.

In 1977 the Local Education Authority appealed to keep its grammar schools rather than be forced by the government to adopt a comprehensive system. The Lord of Appeal Lord Lane was personally critical of Fred Mulley, the Secretary of State for Education and Science for being &quot;far from frank&quot; about his reason for intervening in Tameside and joined in the judgement which found for Tameside and brought a halt to comprehensivisation. However, following the election of a Labour council in 1980 the local grammar schools were abolished and all the secondary modern and grammar schools in Stalybridge, Hyde and Dukinfield became comprehensives.

<text>Broadbottom is a village in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England. Historically in Cheshire, it stands on the River Etherow which forms the border with Derbyshire.

==Description==
Home Farm dates from 1604 and Broadbottom Hall from 1680.

There was a 14th-century water-powered corn mill and an 18th-century woollen mill, called &quot;Moss Mill&quot;, which converted to producing cotton in the 19th century.

Broadbottom has one remaining textile mill that is still operating called &quot;Lymefield Mill&quot;. The factory mill is next to the River Etherow and is currently occupied by Tiviot Prints Ltd.

==Landmarks==
East of the railway station is Broadbottom Viaduct that carries the railway line over the River Etherow. The official length of the viaduct is .

At Summerbottom, there is a row of 18th-century weavers&#x27; cottages; they had a communal top floor where the looms were stored.

Hodge Printworks started out as a woollen mill in 1798. In 1805, it was converted into a dyeworks. The dyed cloth was of such high quality that some pieces are still on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1986, a team of archaeologists excavated the dye vats.

Best Hill Mill was started in 1784 by John Marsland, but closed in 1884. The mill reopened early in the 20th century to make tape and webbing for use in World War I. It closed again in 1930.

Broad Mills was a collection of mills (factories), including a calico printing mill, run by the Sidebottom family. In the 1840s, it ran 25,000 spindles and 1,500 looms; by 1860, there were 1,200 people working there. The mill was bought by the John Hirst &amp; Sons in 1872. In 1889, it became part of Broadbottom Mills Ltd who also owned Lymefield Mill. In 1906, it passed to the Broad Mills Co. Ltd., who worked it until 1934 when they went into liquidation. A fire in the 1940s led to the mills&#x27; demolition in 1949. Lymefield Visitor Centre is close to the mills.

==Transport==

Broadbottom railway station is on the Glossop Line, east of Manchester Piccadilly. 

Services, operated by Northern Trains, run generally half-hourly between Manchester Piccadilly, Glossop and Hadfield.

==Community==
Broadbottom Community Association organises events throughout the year for the local residents; their programme can be found on their website. The BCA has published a book about the history of Broadbottom compiled by local resident Mollie Sayer.

Broadbottom Cricket Club plays in the Derbyshire and Cheshire League.

==Notable people==
Actress Millie Gibson, known for &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, hails from Broadbottom.

<text>Louise Charlin Perrin Labé ( – 25 April 1566), also identified as La Belle Cordière (&quot;The Fair Ropemaker&quot;) after her father&#x27;s job, was a French Renaissance poet from Lyon.

== Biography==
Louise Labé was born in Lyon, into a family of ropemakers, surgeons, and butchers. Her father, Pierre Charly, was a successful ropemaker, who started a business on rue de l&#x27;Arbre sec, at the base of Saint Sébastien Hill in Lyon. When his first wife died in 1515, he married Etiennette Roybet, and had five children: Barthélemy, Francois, Mathieu, Claudine, and Louise. It is presumed that Louise Labé was born at some point between her father&#x27;s wedding in 1516 and her mother&#x27;s death in 1523.

Records show that Labé&#x27;s father, despite his humble beginnings, eventually achieved some social prestige. For example, in 1534, he was summoned before the Assemblée de Consuls of the city of Lyon to approve and participate in the founding of a relief agency for the poor.

At some point, perhaps in a convent school, Labé received an education in foreign languages (Greek, Latin, Italian, and Spanish) and music, specifically the lute.

As a young woman, she was acclaimed as an extraordinary horsewoman and archer. Her early biographers called her &quot;la belle Amazone&quot; and report that she dressed in male clothing and fought as a knight on horseback in the ranks of the Dauphin (afterwards Henry II) at the siege of Perpignan. She was also said to have participated in tournament jousts performed in Lyon in honor of Henry II&#x27;s visit.

Between 1543 and 1545 she married Ennemond Perrin, also a Lyon ropemaker, a marriage dictated in her father&#x27;s will, and which established the succession of the rope manufacturing business he was involved in. The business must have been prosperous, since the couple purchased a townhouse with a large garden in 1551, and, in 1557, a country estate at Parcieux-en-Dombes near Lyon.

Lyon was the cultural centre of France in the first half of the sixteenth century and Labé hosted a literary salon that included many of the renowned Lyonnais poets and humanists, including Maurice Scève, Clement Marot, Claude de Taillemont, Pontus de Tyard, and Pernette du Guillet.

The poet Olivier de Magny, passing through Lyon on his way to Rome, fell in love with Labé, and is the likely subject of her love sonnets. Magny&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; contained a poem (&quot;A Sire Aymon&quot;) that mocked and belittled Labé&#x27;s husband (who had died by 1557).

Perhaps inspired by the posthumous publication of Pernette du Guillet&#x27;s collection of love poems in 1545, Labé began writing her own poetry. On March 13, 1555, Labé received from Henry II a privilège protecting her exclusive right to publish her works for a period of 5 years. Her &quot;Œuvres&quot; were printed in 1555, by the renowned Lyonnais printer Jean de Tournes. In addition to her own writings, the volume contained twenty-four poems in her honour, authored by her male contemporaries and entitled (&quot;Writings of diverse poets, in praise of Louise Labé of Lyons&quot;). The authors of these praise poems (not all of whom can be reliably identified) include Maurice Scève, Pontus de Tyard, Claude de Taillemont, Clément Marot, Olivier de Magny, Jean-Antoine de Baïf, Mellin de Saint-Gelais, Antoine du Moulin, and Antoine Fumee. Her contemporaries compare her to Sappho and hail Labé as the Tenth Muse.

Debate on whether Labé was or was not a courtesan began in the sixteenth century, and has continued up to the present day. In 1557 a popular song on the scandalous behavior of &quot;La Cordière&quot; was published in Lyon. In 1560 Jean Calvin referred to her cross-dressing and called her a &quot;plebeia meretrix&quot; or &quot;common whore.&quot; Scholars deliberate carefully over what status to accord to such statements published in a piece of religious propaganda by a writer whose tone has been described as vicious and hysterical, and similarly question to what extent the historian Paradin, writing in 1573, was aiming at neutral objectivity in writing &quot;She had a face more angelic than human, which was yet nothing in comparison with her spirit which was so chaste, so virtuous, so poetic and of such uncommon knowledge that it would seem to have been created by God so that we may wonder at it as something prodigious.&quot;

In 1564, the plague broke out in Lyon, taking the lives of some of Labé&#x27;s friends. In 1565, suffering herself from bad health, she retired to the home of her companion Thomas Fortin, a banker from Florence, who witnessed her will (a document that is extant). She died there in 1566, and was buried on her country property close to Parcieux-en-Dombes, outside Lyon.

Debates on whether or not she was a courtesan and other aspects of her life have not always been of interest to critics who have focussed increasing attention on her writings, especially her verse.

==Works and reception==

Her &quot;Œuvres&quot; include two prose works: a feminist preface, urging women to write, that is dedicated to a young noblewoman of Lyon, Clémence de Bourges; and a dramatic allegory in prose entitled &quot;Débat de Folie et d&#x27;Amour&quot; (translated into English by Robert Greene in 1608), which belongs to a long tradition with examples from antiquity through to the Middle Ages, a tradition that had gained contemporary prominence due to the controversial satire, Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Praise of Folly&quot;. The &quot;Débat,&quot; the most admired of her works in the sixteenth century, was used as the source for one of the fables of Jean de la Fontaine, and was translated into English by Robert Greene in 1584.

Her poetry consists of three elegies in the style of the &quot;Heroides&quot; of Ovid, and twenty-four sonnets that draw on the traditions of Neoplatonism and Petrarchism. The great theme of her sonnets are the longings, torments and satisfactions of a passionate love which, however noble, is very much of this world, with no metaphysical concepts evoked and no references to a more perfect world than this one. A critic such as Breghot du Lut, writing for the 1824 edition of her works, found that he must apologize to the reader for her explicitness of some of her works; Sainte-Beuve, in 1845, expressed something that was to become a refrain for readers and critics up to this day: despite her work showing that she was highly learned, this does not prevent her from seeming to speak to contemporary readers in a very direct way.

Her poetry was singled out among that of her contemporaries for special praise by Rilke, with Ferdinand Brunetière, in his 1900 article on the Pléiade and Lyonnese schools, writing that her poetry was the first time in French that passion was expressed with such vehemence and naiveté. Modern critics cite her rejection of the more showy or extravagant metaphors and poetic effects employed by poets such as Scève or Pernette du Guillet as one of the key components of her originality and appeal for the modern reader, with Jerry C. Nash writing in 1980

&quot;Labé&#x27;s lyrical voice is truly one of the best expressions in literature of artful simplicity, of a consistent and masterly synthesis of substance and form, of passion and poetry&quot;.

Readers have, from the middle of the last century, commented on how in her verse she presents women in a way that goes against prevailing attitudes about what a woman&#x27;s nature was or what made a woman either praiseworthy or blameworthy, a feature which makes her appear more in step with modern ideas than her contemporaries were. The frank expression of female desire had previously been confined to comic genres such as fabliaux.

In 2005, Labé&#x27;s work was included on the programme of a very prestigious exam in France, sparking a flurry of academic publications. The most remarked upon of these was the 2006 book &quot;Louise Labé: une créature de papier&quot; (Droz); discussed below.

The sonnets have been her most famous works following the early modern period, and were translated into German by Rainer Maria Rilke and into Dutch by Pieter Cornelis Boutens. They have been translated into English, maintaining the exact rhyme patterns of the originals, by poet Annie Finch (published in the same volume with a translation of Labé&#x27;s prose by Deborah Lesko Baker, University of Chicago Press, 2006), and by Richard Siebuth in a volume published by NYRB (2014).

=== Marc Fumaroli and Mireille Huchon ===

In her 2006 book the Sorbonne professor and specialist of Rabelais Mireille Huchon controversially argued that, despite over four centuries of scholarship and biographical evidence to the contrary, Louise Labé was not the author of the works signed with her name but rather that these works were by the Lyonnais poets Maurice Scève, Olivier de Magny, Claude de Taillemont, Jacques Peletier du Mans, Guillaume des Autels, and others, and by the publisher Jean de Tournes. The conservative critic Marc Fumaroli called Huchon&#x27;s argument &quot;irrefutable&quot; in the literature supplement of &quot;Le Monde&quot;. Numerous critics and scholars examined Huchon&#x27;s essay and frequently found her reasoning absurd, judging that her interpretation of the biographical evidence seemed to show inexplicable bias and reliance on unfounded assumptions. The lack of any evidence in support of her thesis was a further reason for the ease with which many dismissed her ideas as mistaken and considered Huchon&#x27;s work to have made no valuable contribution to scholarship. The list of eminent scholars opposing Huchon include Emmanuel Buron, Henri Hours, Bernard Plessy, Madeleine Lazard, Daniel Martin, Eliane Viennot, and many others. Despite strong objections from most Labé scholars, however, Huchon&#x27;s audacious thesis has not entirely disappeared from view.

<doc id="166178" wikidata="Q1502787" url="?curid=166178" title="Iconclass">
<text>Iconclass is a specialized library classification designed for classifying the subjects and content of images in art (their iconography). It was originally conceived by the Dutch art historian Henri van de Waal in the 1970s, and was further developed by a group of scholars after his death.

It is one of the largest classification systems for cultural content and probably the largest for visual arts content. Initially designed for historical imagery, it is now also used to create subject access to texts and to classify a wide range of images, including modern photography. At the moment it contains over 28,000 unique concepts (classification types) and has an entry vocabulary of 14,000 keywords. Like the Dewey Decimal Classification and Universal Decimal Classification systems, it has 10 main &quot;divisions&quot; or points of entry:

*0 Abstract, Non-representational Art
*1 Religion and Magic
*2 Nature
*3 Human being, Man in general
*4 Society, Civilization, Culture
*5 Abstract Ideas and Concepts
*6 History
*7 Bible
*8 Literature
*9 Classical Mythology and Ancient History

Each division has 9 or 10 subdivisions, and so on. It can be consulted with the help of the freely available Iconclass 2100 browser. Iconclass was developed in the Netherlands as a standard classification for recording collections, with the idea of assembling huge databases that will allow the retrieval of images featuring particular details, subjects or other common factors. It was developed in the 1970s and was loosely based on the Dewey Decimal System because it was meant to be used in art library card catalogs.

The content of Iconclass is maintained by the Henri van de Waal Foundation.

==Usage in data records==
The iconclass code represents a concept and objects can be assigned a code indicating that the object depicts that concept. For example, the iconclass code &quot;71H7131&quot; is for the subject of &quot;Bathsheba (alone) with David&#x27;s letter&quot;. The code is built from &quot;7&quot; for bible, &quot;71&quot; for &quot;Old Testament&quot;, &quot;71H&quot; the &quot;story of David&quot;, &quot;71H7&quot; for &quot;David and Bathsheba&quot;, &quot;71H71&quot; for &quot;David observing Bathsheba bathing&quot;, &quot;71H713&quot; for &quot;Bathsheba receiving a letter from David&quot; and &quot;71H7131&quot; for &quot;Bathsheba alone with David&#x27;s letter&quot;
===Depicting the iconclass concept===
To see all images in the RKDimages database that depict &quot;Bathsheba receiving a letter from David&quot;, the associated iconclass code 71H713 can be used as a special search term. On selecting one of these paintings and viewing its record in RKDimages, the code 71H713 can be seen under two sections; under the section for &quot;subject&quot; and under the section for &quot;suggested searches&quot;.

==== More examples ====
===The iconclass concept as a subject===
Everyone with an account can add to the iconclass hierarchy. Some of these hierarchies are quite detailed, such as for stories of the Old Testament that were popular in the arts during the 17th-century. The problems of using iconclass codes for concepts is that they are a bit too precise. In the previous search example for 71H713 in the RKDimages database, the painting record for Rembrandt&#x27;s Bathsheba in the Louvre was excluded from the search, because the iconclass code assigned to that painting in the RKDimages database is not 71H713, but 71H7131, and searching for that code will result in other images to be returned.

==Usage by organizations==
A number of collections of different types have been classified using Iconclass, notably many types of old master print, the collections of the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin and the German Marburger Index. These can be matched to each other through the iconclass &quot;hierarchy of somethings&quot; to the current classification structure of the holder&#x27;s collection. Completed iconclass projects are available, often online, but also published on DVD. Ideally however, iconclass coding is never finished, as it is also possible to keep adding codes to the system to identify more concepts. The system can also be used outside pure art history, though it is most often used in museum websites.

<text>Bonaventure des Périers (1544) was a French writer.

== Biography ==
He was born of a noble family at Arnay-le-duc in Burgundy at the end of the fifteenth century.

The circumstances of his education are sketchy, but it is known that he was attached to various noble houses in the capacity of tutor. In 1533 or 1534 Des Périers visited Lyon, then the most enlightened town of France, and a refuge for many liberal scholars who might elsewhere have had to suffer for their opinions. He gave some assistance to Robert Olivetan and Lefèvre d&#x27;Etaples in the preparation of the vernacular version of the Old Testament, and to Etienne Dolet in the &quot;Commentarii linguae latinae&quot;.

In 1536 he put himself under the protection of Marguerite de Navarre, queen of Navarre, who made him her &quot;valet de chambre&quot;. He acted as the queen&#x27;s secretary, and transcribed the &quot;Heptaméron&quot; for her. It is probable that his duties extended beyond those of a mere copyist, and some writers have gone so far as to say that the &quot;Heptaméron&quot; was his work.

The free discussions permitted at Marguerite&#x27;s court encouraged a licence of thought as displeasing to the Calvinists as to the Catholics. This free inquiry became scepticism in Bonaventure&#x27;s &quot;Cymbalum Mundi ...&quot; (1537) and the queen of Navarre thought it prudent to disavow the author, though she continued to help him privately until 1541. The book consisted of four dialogues in imitation of Lucian. Its allegorical form did not conceal its real meaning, and it was likely printed by Morin in early 1538. In March of that year, King Francis I asked that the book be examined and the Sorbonne confirmed the suppression of the edition in July 1538.

The dedication provides a key to the author&#x27;s intention: &quot;Thomas du Clevier&quot; (or Clenier) &quot;a son ami Pierre Tryocan&quot; was recognized by 19th century editors to be an anagram for &quot;Thomas l&#x27;Incrédule a son ami Pierre Croyant&quot; (Thomas the Incredulous to Peter the Believer). It is considered by some scholars to be the first atheist book in French literature, though its highly enigmatic nature has led to many other interpretations. The book was reprinted in Lyon in 1538, which made many bitter enemies for the author. Henri Estienne called it detestable, and Étienne Pasquier said it deserved to be thrown into the fire with its author if he were still living.

Des Périers prudently left Paris, and after some time settled at Lyon where he lived in poverty, until he reportedly (though this is dubious) committing suicide in 1544 by falling on his sword. In 1544 his collected works were printed at Lyon. The volume, &quot;Recueil des Œuvres de feu Bonaventure des Périers&quot;, included his poems, which are of small merit, the &quot;Traité des quatre venus cardinales après Sénèque&quot;, and a translation of the &quot;Lysis&quot; of Plato.

In 1558 the collection of stories and fables entitled the &quot;Nouvelles récréations et joyeux devis&quot; was released in Lyon. It is on this work that the claim put forward for Des Périers as one of the early masters of French prose rests. Some of the tales are attributed to the editors, Nicholas Denisot and Jacques Peletier, but their share is certainly limited to the later ones. The book leaves something to be desired on the score of morality, but the stories never lack point and are models of simple, direct narration in the vigorous and picturesque French of the 16th century.

<text>Étienne Pasquier (7 June 152930 August 30 1615) was a French lawyer and man of letters. By his own account he was born in Paris on 7 June 1529, but according to others he was born in 1528. He was called to the Paris bar in 1549.

In 1558 he became very ill by eating poisonous mushrooms and took two years to recover. This compelled him to occupy himself with literary work and in 1560 he published the first book of his &quot;Recherches de la France&quot;. In 1565, when he was thirty-seven he became famous after giving a speech in which he pleaded the cause of the University of Paris against the Jesuits and won it. Meanwhile, he pursued the &quot;Recherches&quot; steadily and published other miscellaneous work from time to time.

His literary and his legal occupations coincided in a curious fashion at the &quot;&quot; of Poitiers in 1579. These Grands Jours (an institution which fell into desuetude at the end of the 17th century, with bad effects on the social and political welfare of the French provinces) were a kind of irregular assize in which a commission of the parlement of Paris, selected and dispatched at short notice by the king, had full power to hear and determine all causes, especially those in which seignorial rights had been abused. At the &quot;Grands Jours&quot; of Poitiers of the date mentioned and at those of Troyes in 1583, Pasquier officiated; and each occasion has left a curious literary memorial of the jests with which he and his colleagues relieved their graver duties. The Poitiers work was the celebrated collection of poems on flea (&quot;La Puce de Madame Des Roches&quot;, published 1583; see Catherine Des Roches).

In 1585 Pasquier was appointed by Henry III advocate-general at the Paris &quot;cours des comptes&quot;, an important body having political as well as financial and legal functions. Here he distinguished himself particularly by opposing, sometimes successfully, the system of selling hereditary places and offices. The civil wars forced Pasquier to leave Paris and for some years he lived in Tours, working steadily on his great book, but he returned to Paris in Henry IV&#x27;s train in March 1594. He continued until 1604 with his work on the &quot;chambre des comptes&quot;; then he retired. He lived more than ten years in retirement, producing much literary work and died after a few hours&#x27; illness on 1 September 1615.

In so long and so laborious a life, Pasquier&#x27;s work was substantial but has never been fully collected or printed. The standard edition is that of Amsterdam (2 vols. fol., 1723). But for ordinary readers the selections of Leon Feugbre, published in Paris (2 vols. 8vo, 1849), with an elaborate introduction, are most accessible. As a poet Pasquier is chiefly interesting as a minor member of the Pléiade movement. As a prose writer he is much more accomplished. The three chief divisions of his prose work are his &quot;Recherches&quot;, his letters and his professional speeches. The letters are of much biographical interest and historical importance and the &quot;Recherches&quot; contain in a somewhat miscellaneous fashion invaluable information on a vast variety of subjects, literary, political, antiquarian and others.

==Recherches de la France==
Pasquier&#x27;s historical work is seen as an important predecessor to modern historiography, although he is indebted to the methods of other important Italian historians. He makes frequent use of primary sources (or contemporary chroniclers) and cites them as he goes along. Contrary to many other historical works of the time, Pasquier sought to create an accurate reconstruction of the past for the present needs of France, which he held to be in a period of crisis.

He looked to define France in terms of its customs and culture and wrote a distinctly national history. He began his story not with the origins of human civilization but with the origins of France in the Gauls. While he lamented his lack of sources on the subject, he tried to extract what he could from things such as Caesar&#x27;s writings on Gaul.

Pasquier attempted to contrast France with Rome and believed that the history of France is as great as the history of Rome, criticizing the widespread use of Latin, Roman law, etc. Instead, he had great respect for French literature and institutions without glorifying the history of France and its kings in the way of previous chroniclers.

<text>Victim is a 1961 British neo-noir suspense film directed by Basil Dearden and starring Dirk Bogarde and Sylvia Syms. The first British film to explicitly name homosexuality and deal with it sympathetically, it premiered in the UK on 31 August 1961 and in the US the following February.

On its release in the United Kingdom, the film proved highly controversial to the British Board of Film Censors, and in the US it was refused a seal of approval from the American Motion Picture Production Code. Despite this, it received acclaim and is now regarded as a British classic, and it has been credited with liberalising attitudes towards homosexuality in Great Britain.

==Plot==
Melville Farr is a successful barrister with a thriving London practice. He is on course to become a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, and people are already talking of him being appointed a judge. One day, Farr receives a call from Jack &quot;Boy&quot; Barrett, a young working-class gay man with whom he previously had a romantic friendship. Farr, who is apparently happily married to Laura, assumes Barrett wants to blackmail him about their relationship, so he does not listen and tells Barrett not to call him again. In reality, however, Barrett has been trying to reach Farr to appeal for help, because he has fallen prey to blackmailers who have a picture of Farr and Barrett in a vehicle together. The image is somewhat compromising, as Barrett is crying and Farr&#x27;s arm is around him, so Barrett stole £2,300 (£ today) from his employers to pay the blackmail, but he has been found out and now the police are pursuing him, so he needs financial assistance to flee the country. After managing to borrow £20 from a friend, Barrett is picked up by the police, who quickly deduce that he is being blackmailed, and even make a connection to Farr when they recover a scrapbook of articles that Barrett was unable to successfully destroy before his capture. Knowing it will only be a matter of time before he is forced to reveal the details of the blackmail scheme and Farr&#x27;s role, Barrett hangs himself in a police cell.

After learning the truth about how Barrett had tried to protect him, Farr decides to take on the blackmail ring, recruiting Eddy, Barrett&#x27;s friend and roommate, to identify others whom the blackmailers may be targeting. Eddy directs Farr to Henry, a hairdresser, but Henry refuses to identify his tormentors to Farr. When one of the blackmailers, a young man who goes by &quot;Sandy&quot;, visits Henry&#x27;s salon and begins to destroy it, Henry suffers a heart attack. Just before dying, he calls Farr&#x27;s house and leaves a mumbled message that names another victim of the blackmailers.

Following up on the lead, Farr contacts a prominent stage actor named Calloway, but Calloway also refuses to help, as he would prefer to continue paying and keep his sexuality secret. Laura finds out about Barrett&#x27;s suicide and confronts her husband. After a heated argument, during which Farr maintains that he has kept the promise he made when they married that he would no longer indulge his homosexual attraction, Laura decides that Farr has betrayed that promise by having a relationship with Barrett, even if it was not physical, and openly begins to consider leaving him.

Eddy identifies a car salesman named Phip as another victim of the blackmailers, and Farr gets Phip to let him go to an appointment with Sandy by offering to buy back the letters that are being used to blackmail Phip. Farr tells Sandy that he wants Phip&#x27;s letters and the negatives of the pictures of him and Barrett. Sandy consults with his partner, and then, to put pressure on Farr, vandalises Farr&#x27;s Chiswick home by painting &quot;FARR IS QUEER&quot; on the garage door.

Undeterred, Farr works with the police to capture the blackmailers after they pick up his money for the letters and negatives, and they discover that Sandy was working with Miss Benham, who wants to make homosexuals &quot;pay for their filthy blasphemy&quot;, and that the duo started getting information about their marks from Phip once he could no longer afford to keep paying them. Farr promises to testify at the blackmailers&#x27; trial, even though the ensuing press coverage will certainly destroy his career and reputation, as he hopes his involvement will help draw attention to the problems with the existing laws against homosexuality.

Surprised to find Laura still at home, Farr tells her to leave town before the ugliness of the trial. When she asks if she should return afterward, he says he will welcome her back, as he will &quot;need [her] so desperately.&quot; She responds that &quot;need&quot; is &quot;a bigger word than &#x27;love and says she thinks she has the strength to stand by him. After Laura leaves, Farr burns a print of the suggestive photograph of him and Barrett.

==Production==
===Background===
Homosexual acts between males were illegal in England and Wales until the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which implemented the recommendations of the Wolfenden report published a decade earlier. The fact that willing participants in consensual homosexual acts could be prosecuted made them vulnerable to entrapment, and the criminalisation of homosexuality was known as the &quot;blackmailer&#x27;s charter&quot;. Homosexuals were prosecuted and tabloid newspapers covered the court proceedings. By 1960, however, the police demonstrated little enthusiasm for prosecuting those engaged in homosexual activity. There was an inclination to &quot;turn a blind eye&quot; to homosexuality, because there was a feeling that the legal code violated basic liberties. However, public opprobrium, even in the absence of criminal prosecution, continued to require homosexuals to keep their identity secret and made them vulnerable to blackmail. The film treats homosexuality in a non-sensationalised manner.

The scriptwriter Janet Green had previously collaborated with Basil Dearden on a British &quot;social problem&quot; film, &quot;Sapphire&quot; (1959), which dealt with racism against Afro-Caribbean immigrants to the United Kingdom in the late 1950s. After reading the Wolfenden report, and knowing of several high-profile prosecutions of gay men, Green became a keen supporter of homosexual law reform. She wrote the screenplay with her husband John McCormick. Despite its then controversial subject, the film was, in other respects, quite conventional in being quite chaste. Farr has not had sex with Barrett, nor with the man he loved at university. The audience is allowed just one glimpse of the photo of Farr and Barrett (seen from the obverse of the print), and the screenplay underscores the fact that only Barrett&#x27;s tears suggest anything untoward, along with the breaking of social taboos in that they are different classes and far apart in age. In addition, the film promises that Farr and Laura will remain united and faithful to one another. As Pauline Kael wrote: 
The language the screenplay used to describe its controversial subject attracted comment. It used &quot;the familiar colloquial terms&quot;, wrote one reviewer without specifying them, even as he referred to &quot;homosexuality&quot;, &quot;the abnormality&quot;, and &quot;the condition&quot;. The term &quot;queer&quot; – then a pejorative term not yet adopted by advocates for LGBT rights – is used several times in the film, and &quot;FARR IS QUEER&quot; is painted on Farr&#x27;s garage door. The more polite term &quot;invert&quot; appears as well.

===Casting===
When the team of producer Michael Relph and director Basil Dearden first approached Bogarde, several actors had already turned down the role, including Jack Hawkins, James Mason, and Stewart Granger. In 1960, Bogarde was 39 and had been chosen by British audiences as their favourite British film star for years, having spent the past 14 years being cast as a matinée idol by The Rank Organisation. He had proven himself playing war heroes in films such as &quot;The Sea Shall Not Have Them&quot; (1954) and &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot; (1957), he was the star of the hugely successful &quot;Doctor&quot; film series, and he had been a reliable romantic lead in films such as &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1958). He was also flirting with a larger, Hollywood career, having recently played Franz Liszt in &quot;Song Without End&quot; (1960).

Bogarde was suspected to be homosexual and lived in the same house as his business manager, Anthony Forwood, so he was compelled to be seen occasionally in public with attractive young women. He seems not to have hesitated to accept the role of Farr, a married lawyer with a homosexual past that he has not quite put behind him. Reportedly, Bogarde himself wrote the scene in which Farr admits to his wife that he is gay and has continued to be attracted to other men, despite his earlier assurances to the contrary.

Of his first independent film project and 34th film, Bogarde said in 1965: &quot;For the first time I was playing my own age. At Rank, the fixed rule was that I had to look pretty. &quot;Victim&quot; ended all that nonsense.&quot; He wrote years later in his autobiography that his father had suggested he make an adaptation of &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, &quot;But I did Victim instead, ... playing the barrister with the loving wife, a loyal housekeeper, devoted secretary and the Secret Passion. It was the wisest decision I ever made in my cinematic life. It is extraordinary, in this over-permissive age [c. 1988], to believe that this modest film could ever have been considered courageous, daring or dangerous to make. It was, in its time, all three.&quot;

Similarly, though several actresses had turned down the role, Sylvia Syms readily accepted the part of Laura. English film critic Mark Kermode has noted her reasons for this included previous theatre work with John Gielgud, which exposed her to the laws surrounding homosexuality at the time, and that a family friend of hers had died by suicide after being accused of being gay. Consequently, Sims felt the film&#x27;s story had to be told. Some of the cast members who were gay in real life include Dennis Price and Hilton Edwards.

===Filming===
Syms later recalled that filming had to be completed in just 10 days. Shooting locations included The Salisbury, Covent Garden. The film&#x27;s original title of &quot;Boy Barrett&quot; was changed to &quot;Victim&quot; late in production. Relph and Dearden acknowledged that the film was designed to be &quot;an open protest against Britain&#x27;s law that being a homosexual is a criminal act&quot;.

==Censor reaction==
===British censor===
An official of the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) had set out its view of homosexuality in film: &quot;to the great majority of cinema-goers, homosexuality is outside their direct experience and is something which is shocking, distasteful and disgusting&quot;. Relph said that in &quot;Victim&quot;, by contrast: &quot;What I think we want to say is that the homosexual, although subject to a psychological or glandular variation from sexual normality, is a human being subject to all the emotions of other human beings, and as deserving of our understanding. Unless he sets out to corrupt others, it is wrong for the law to pillory him because of his inversion.&quot; He said &quot;Victim&quot; was &quot;a story not of glands but of love.&quot;

Although a number of controversial scenes were cut before the film&#x27;s release during discussions with the BBFC, including scenes with teenagers, the BBFC nevertheless gave the film an &quot;X&quot; rating—that is, &quot;recommended for adults only&quot;—a classification which was then usually reserved for erotica and horror films. In a letter to the filmmakers, the BBFC secretary raised four objections to the film. First, a male character says of another man: &quot;I wanted him&quot;. Second, references to &quot;self-control&quot; in the revised script were omitted from the filmed discussion of homosexuality, leaving the discussion &quot;without sufficient counterbalance&quot;. Third, the film implies that homosexuality is a choice, which &quot;is a dangerous idea to put into the minds of adolescents who see the film&quot;. Finally, the one blackmailer who unleashes a tirade against homosexuality is so unsympathetic that the views expressed will be discredited.

===US censor===
In the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America&#x27;s Production Code Administration, the film industry&#x27;s self-censorship board that enforced the guidelines established by the Motion Picture Production Code, denied &quot;Victim&quot; its seal of approval. A spokesperson cited the film&#x27;s &quot;candid and clinical discussion of homosexuality&quot; and its &quot;overtly expressed pleas for social acceptance of the homosexual, to the extent that he be made socially tolerable&quot;. He noted that the subject of homosexuality was acceptable under the recently relaxed Production Code if handled with &quot;care, discretion and restraint&quot;.

The head of the US distributor appealed the decision and announced the film would be released in February even if the appeal was denied. He described &quot;Victim&quot; as a &quot;tasteful film on a delicate subject&quot;. A few years before the release of &quot;Victim&quot;, the filmmakers of &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; (1959) had persuaded the code censors to allow that film to use homosexuality as a plot device, but only by presenting it through cryptic innuendos, and the film had to illustrate the &quot;horrors of such a lifestyle&quot;. &quot;Victim&quot;, in contrast, was deemed to be too frank in its treatment of homosexuality, and not initially approved by the censorship code.

In 1962, the Hollywood Production Code agreed to lift the ban on films using homosexuality as a plot device. A few years later, the code was replaced by the MPAA film rating system, which introduced an age-appropriate classification system for films. As attitudes became more liberal, the rating classifications for the film were revised, and when &quot;Victim&quot; was released on VHS in the US in 1986, it was rated PG-13.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Victim&quot; premiered at the Odeon Cinema in Leicester Square on 31 August 1961, and its US premiere occurred on 5 February 1962 at two theaters in New York. It was the only British entry in the Venice Film Festival in 1961, where an Italian critic commented: &quot;at last the British have stopped being hypocrites&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was not a major hit, but it was popular, and by 1971 it had earned an estimated profit of £51,762.

===Critical reception===
British reviews of the film praised Bogarde&#x27;s performance as his best and praised his courage in taking on the role. A London magazine called it &quot;the most startlingly outspoken film Britain has ever produced&quot;. An anonymous reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; commented that &quot;&quot;Victim&quot; may not say a great deal about&quot; the related issues of the nature of &#x27;love&#x27; and gay men&#x27;s &quot;genuine feeling&quot; for each other, &quot;but what it does say is reasoned and just; and it does invite a compassionate consideration of this particular form of human bondage&quot;. However, Terence Kelly of &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; saw problems with the film, and wrote that &quot;Victim&quot; contains &quot;a tour of the more respectable parts of the London homosexual underworld, with glimpses of the ways in which different men cope with or are destroyed by their abnormality&quot;, but he did comment that &quot;the film unequivocally condemns the way&quot; blackmail &quot;is encouraged by the present state of the law&quot;.

Bosley Crowther wrote that the film &quot;appears more substantial and impressive than its dramatic content justifies&quot; because &quot;it deals with a subject that heretofore has been studiously shied away from or but cautiously hinted at on the commercial screen&quot;. He found the script &quot;routine&quot; and &quot;shoddily constructed&quot; as drama, but successful as a political argument:

Crowther qualified his praise of Bogarde&#x27;s acting, saying that &quot;Dirk Bogarde does a strong, forceful, forthright job, with perhaps a little too much melancholy and distress in his attitude, now and again&quot;, and summed up his mixed view with the statement: &quot;While the subject is disagreeable, it is not handled distastefully. And while the drama is not exciting, it has a definite intellectual appeal.&quot;

Chris Waters has argued that &quot;&quot;Victim&quot; took for granted that homosexuality was a social problem that needed to be explored calmly and dispassionately&quot; as a result of the &quot;wake of the social dislocations associated with the war and the various anxieties to which they gave rise&quot;. He elaborated on this further by referring to Kenneth Soddy, a physician in the Department of Psychological Medicine at University College London Hospital, who wrote in 1954 that, while homosexuality itself did not trouble the community, its &quot;social disturbance&quot; during the war caused &quot;variations in social and sexual practices which engenders attacks of acute public anxiety.&quot; As such, Waters argues that the film portrays homosexuality in a sensationalised way that would have deliberately drawn public attention to the issue.

Before the film was released in the US, a news report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as a political work, saying: &quot;the movie is a dramatized condemnation, based on the Wolfenden Report, of Britain&#x27;s laws on homosexuality.&quot;

In relation to a BFI Southbank retrospective screening season of Bogarde&#x27;s films, Peter Bradshaw argued that &quot;it could be that &quot;Victim&quot; may come to be valued, 50 years on, not as a study of homosexuality, but of blackmail and paranoia.&quot; He pointed out that Farr never engages in homosexual acts, but, rather, &quot;appears&quot; to have a &quot;passionate, unconsummated infatuation with a young man at university&quot; and then, later, a liaison with a &quot;young building-site worker&quot;, both unconsummated arrangements to prove his interest. Bradshaw wrote that Bogarde&#x27;s lighting is more haunting than necessary in the confrontation scenes with his wife, and noticed similarities to the work of Patrick Hamilton, especially &quot;the seedy, nasty world of pubs and drinking holes around ... London&#x27;s West End&quot;, concluding his review with the statement: &quot;It is perhaps in its evocation of the strange, occult world of blackmail, conspiracy and shame, and the seediness of a certain type of London, that &quot;Victim&quot; holds up best.&quot;

&quot;Victim&quot; became a highly sociologically significant film, and many believe it played an influential role in liberalising attitudes and the laws in Britain regarding homosexuality. Alan Burton conducted a 2010 study of &quot;various documents relating to the Wolfenden Report, public opinion, censorship, and the production and reception of &quot;Victim&quot;,&quot; and found that the film, which &quot;has attracted much criticism and debate, largely in terms of its liberal prescriptions and its &#x27;timid&#x27; handling of a controversial theme&quot;, had &quot;significant impact on gay men who struggled with their identity and subjectivity at a time when their sexuality was potentially illegal&quot;.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in January 2011 as part of their &quot;Eclipse Series&quot; box set &quot;Basil Dearden’s London Underground&quot;. It was released on Blu-ray by Network in July 2014.

==Adaptations==
The film&#x27;s producers had a novelisation written by Arthur Calder-Marshall, who wrote under the name William Drummond. The novelisation differs from the film in some details—for example, &quot;Farr&quot; is &quot;Carr&quot; in the book—and there are some additional details—for example, in the book Carr wonders if he married Laura because she closely resembles her brother, with whom he has long been &quot;sentimentally in love&quot;.

In July 2017, marking the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a play dramatising the making of the film, with Ed Stoppard as Bogarde.

<text>The autonomic nervous system (ANS), sometimes called the visceral nervous system and formerly the vegetative nervous system, is a division of the nervous system that operates internal organs, smooth muscle and glands. The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions, such as the heart rate, its force of contraction, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal. The fight-or-flight response, also known as the acute stress response, is set into action by the autonomic nervous system.

The autonomic nervous system is regulated by integrated reflexes through the brainstem to the spinal cord and organs. Autonomic functions include control of respiration, cardiac regulation (the cardiac control center), vasomotor activity (the vasomotor center), and certain reflex actions such as coughing, sneezing, swallowing and vomiting. Those are then subdivided into other areas and are also linked to autonomic subsystems and the peripheral nervous system. The hypothalamus, just above the brain stem, acts as an integrator for autonomic functions, receiving autonomic regulatory input from the limbic system.

Although conflicting reports about its subdivisions exist in the literature, the autonomic nervous system has historically been considered a purely motor system, and has been divided into three branches: the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, and the enteric nervous system. Some textbooks do not include the enteric nervous system as part of this system. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for setting off the fight-or-flight response. The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for the body&#x27;s rest and digestion response. In many cases, both of these systems have &quot;opposite&quot; actions where one system activates a physiological response and the other inhibits it. An older simplification of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems as &quot;excitatory&quot; and &quot;inhibitory&quot; was overturned due to the many exceptions found. A more modern characterization is that the sympathetic nervous system is a &quot;quick response mobilizing system&quot; and the parasympathetic is a &quot;more slowly activated dampening system&quot;, but even this has exceptions, such as in sexual arousal and orgasm, wherein both play a role.

There are inhibitory and excitatory synapses between neurons. A third subsystem of neurons has been named as non-noradrenergic, non-cholinergic transmitters (because they use nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter) and are integral in autonomic function, in particular in the gut and the lungs.

Although the ANS is also known as the visceral nervous system and although most of its fibers carry non-somatic information to the CNS, many authors still consider it only connected with the motor side. Most autonomous functions are involuntary but they can often work in conjunction with the somatic nervous system which provides voluntary control.

==Structure==

The autonomic nervous system has been classically divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system only (i.e., exclusively motor). The sympathetic division emerges from the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar areas, terminating around L2-3. The parasympathetic division has craniosacral &quot;outflow&quot;, meaning that the neurons begin at the cranial nerves (specifically the oculomotor nerve, facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve) and sacral (S2-S4) spinal cord.

The autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ. The preganglionic, or first, neuron will begin at the &quot;outflow&quot; and will synapse at the postganglionic, or second, neuron&#x27;s cell body. The postganglionic neuron will then synapse at the target organ.

===Sympathetic division===

The sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the lateral grey column from T1 to L2/3. These cell bodies are &quot;GVE&quot; (general visceral efferent) neurons and are the preganglionic neurons. There are several locations upon which preganglionic neurons can synapse for their postganglionic neurons:
* paravertebral ganglia (3) of the sympathetic chain (these run on either side of the vertebral bodies)
# cervical ganglia (3)
# thoracic ganglia (12) and rostral lumbar ganglia (2 or 3)
# caudal lumbar ganglia and sacral ganglia
* prevertebral ganglia (celiac ganglion, aorticorenal ganglion, superior mesenteric ganglion, inferior mesenteric ganglion)
* chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (this is the one exception to the two-neuron pathway rule: the synapse is directly efferent onto the target cell bodies)
These ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervation of target organs follows. Examples of splanchnic (visceral) nerves are:
* cervical cardiac nerves and thoracic visceral nerves, which synapse in the sympathetic chain
* thoracic splanchnic nerves (greater, lesser, least), which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia
* lumbar splanchnic nerves, which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia
* sacral splanchnic nerves, which synapse in the inferior hypogastric plexus
These all contain afferent (sensory) nerves as well, known as GVA (general visceral afferent) neurons.

===Parasympathetic division===

The parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations: the brainstem (cranial nerves III, VII, IX, X) or the sacral spinal cord (S2, S3, S4). These are the preganglionic neurons, which synapse with postganglionic neurons in these locations:
* parasympathetic ganglia of the head: ciliary (cranial nerve III), geniculate (cranial nerve VII),
* pterygopalatine (cranial nerve VII and IX), and submandibular (cranial nerve VII and IX),
* ottic in inner ear space (cranial nerve IX)
* tympanic nerve of VII with C9, C10, C5 (cranial nerves VII, XI, X, V) in promontory plexus in middle ear space
* trigeminal ganglion specially sensory (only mastication motor) is common with other ones
* in or near the wall of an organ innervated by the vagus (cranial nerve X) or sacral nerves plexus (S2, S3, S4)
these ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervations of target organs follows. Examples are:
* the postganglionic parasympathetic splanchnic (visceral) nerves
* the vagus nerve, which passes through the thorax and abdominal regions innervating, among other organs, the heart, lungs, liver and stomach

===Enteric nervous system===

====Development of the enteric nervous system====
The intricate process of enteric nervous system (ENS) development begins with the migration of cells from the vagal section of the neural crest. These cells embark on a journey from the cranial region to populate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Concurrently, the sacral section of the neural crest provides an additional layer of complexity by contributing input to the hindgut ganglia. Throughout this developmental journey, numerous receptors exhibiting tyrosine kinase activity, such as Ret and Kit, play indispensable roles. Ret, for instance, plays a critical role in the formation of enteric ganglia derived from cells known as vagal neural crest. In mice, targeted disruption of the RET gene results in renal agenesis and the absence of enteric ganglia, while in humans, mutations in the RET gene are associated with megacolon. Similarly, Kit, another receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, is implicated in Cajal interstitial cell formation, influencing the spontaneous, rhythmic, electrical excitatory activity known as slow waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Understanding the molecular intricacies of these receptors provides crucial insights into the delicate orchestration of ENS development.

====Structure of the enteric nervous system====
The structural complexity of the enteric nervous system (ENS) is a fascinating aspect of its functional significance. Originally perceived as postganglionic parasympathetic neurons, the ENS earned recognition for its autonomy in the early 1900s. Boasting approximately 100 million neurons, a quantity comparable to the spinal cord, the ENS is often described as a &quot;brain of its own.&quot; This description is rooted in the ENS&#x27;s ability to communicate independently with the central nervous system through parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons. At the core of this intricate structure are the myenteric plexus (Auerbach&#x27;s) and the submucous plexus (Meissner&#x27;s), two main plexuses formed by the grouping of nerve-cell bodies into tiny ganglia connected by bundles of nerve processes. The myenteric plexus extends the full length of the gut, situated between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers. Beyond its primary motor and secretomotor functions, the myenteric plexus exhibits projections to submucosal ganglia and enteric ganglia in the pancreas and gallbladder, showcasing the interconnectivity within the ENS. Additionally, the myenteric plexus plays a unique role in innervating motor end plates with the inhibitory neurotransmitter nitric oxide in the striated-muscle segment of the esophagus, a feature exclusive to this organ. Meanwhile, the submucous plexus, most developed in the small intestine, occupies a crucial position in secretory regulation. Positioned in the submucosa between the circular muscle layer and the muscularis mucosa, the submucous plexus&#x27;s neurons innervate intestinal endocrine cells, submucosal blood arteries, and the muscularis mucosa, emphasizing its multifaceted role in gastrointestinal function. Furthermore, ganglionated plexuses in the pancreatic, cystic duct, common bile duct, and gallbladder, resembling submucous plexuses, contribute to the overall complexity of the ENS structure. In this intricate landscape, glial cells emerge as key players, outnumbering enteric neurons and covering the majority of the surface of enteric neuronal-cell bodies with laminar extensions. Resembling the astrocytes of the central nervous system, enteric glial cells respond to cytokines by expressing MHC class II antigens and generating interleukins. This underlines their pivotal role in modulating inflammatory responses in the intestine, adding another layer of sophistication to the functional dynamics of the ENS. The varied morphological shapes of enteric neurons further contribute to the structural diversity of the ENS, with neurons capable of exhibiting up to eight different morphologies. These neurons are primarily categorized into type I and type II, where type II neurons are multipolar with numerous long, smooth processes, and type I neurons feature numerous club-shaped processes along with a single long, slender process. The rich structural diversity of enteric neurons highlights the complexity and adaptability of the ENS in orchestrating a wide array of gastrointestinal functions, reflecting its status as a dynamic and sophisticated component of the nervous system.

===Sensory neurons===

The visceral sensory system - technically not a part of the autonomic nervous system - is composed of primary neurons located in cranial sensory ganglia: the geniculate, petrosal and nodose ganglia, appended respectively to cranial nerves VII, IX and X. These sensory neurons monitor the levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen and sugar in the blood, arterial pressure and the chemical composition of the stomach and gut content. They also convey the sense of taste and smell, which, unlike most functions of the ANS, is a conscious perception. Blood oxygen and carbon dioxide are in fact directly sensed by the carotid body, a small collection of chemosensors at the bifurcation of the carotid artery, innervated by the petrosal (IXth) ganglion.
Primary sensory neurons project (synapse) onto &quot;second order&quot; visceral sensory neurons located in the medulla oblongata, forming the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS), that integrates all visceral information. The nTS also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center, the area postrema, that detects toxins in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and is essential for chemically induced vomiting or conditional taste aversion (the memory that ensures that an animal that has been poisoned by a food never touches it again). All this visceral sensory information constantly and unconsciously modulates the activity of the motor neurons of the ANS.

===Innervation===
Autonomic nerves travel to organs throughout the body. Most organs receive parasympathetic supply by the vagus nerve and sympathetic supply by splanchnic nerves. The sensory part of the latter reaches the spinal column at certain spinal segments. Pain in any internal organ is perceived as referred pain, more specifically as pain from the dermatome corresponding to the spinal segment.

===Motor neurons===

Motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in &quot;autonomic ganglia&quot;. Those of the parasympathetic branch are located close to the target organ whilst the ganglia of the sympathetic branch are located close to the spinal cord.

The sympathetic ganglia here, are found in two chains: the pre-vertebral and pre-aortic chains. The activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by &quot;preganglionic neurons&quot; located in the central nervous system. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located in the spinal cord, at the thorax and upper lumbar levels. Preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are found in the medulla oblongata where they form visceral motor nuclei; the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve; the nucleus ambiguus, the salivatory nuclei, and in the sacral region of the spinal cord.

==Function==
Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions typically function in opposition to each other. But this opposition is better termed complementary in nature rather than antagonistic. For an analogy, one may think of the sympathetic division as the accelerator and the parasympathetic division as the brake. The sympathetic division typically functions in actions requiring quick responses. The parasympathetic division functions with actions that do not require immediate reaction. The sympathetic system is often considered the &quot;fight or flight&quot; system, while the parasympathetic system is often considered the &quot;rest and digest&quot; or &quot;feed and breed&quot; system.

However, many instances of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity cannot be ascribed to &quot;fight&quot; or &quot;rest&quot; situations. For example, standing up from a reclining or sitting position would entail an unsustainable drop in blood pressure if not for a compensatory increase in the arterial sympathetic tonus. Another example is the constant, second-to-second, modulation of heart rate by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, as a function of the respiratory cycles. In general, these two systems should be seen as permanently modulating vital functions, in a usually antagonistic fashion, to achieve homeostasis.
Higher organisms maintain their integrity via homeostasis which relies on negative feedback regulation which, in turn, typically depends on the autonomic nervous system. Some typical actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are listed below.
===Sympathetic nervous system===

Promotes a fight-or-flight response, corresponds with arousal and energy generation, and inhibits digestion
* Diverts blood flow away from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and skin via vasoconstriction
* Blood flow to skeletal muscles and the lungs is enhanced (by as much as 1200% in the case of skeletal muscles)
* Dilates bronchioles of the lung through circulating epinephrine, which allows for greater alveolar oxygen exchange
* Increases heart rate and the contractility of cardiac cells (myocytes), thereby providing a mechanism for enhanced blood flow to skeletal muscles
* Dilates pupils and relaxes the ciliary muscle to the lens, allowing more light to enter the eye and enhances far vision
* Provides vasodilation for the coronary vessels of the heart
* Constricts all the intestinal sphincters and the urinary sphincter
* Inhibits peristalsis
* Stimulates orgasm
The pattern of innervation of the sweat gland—namely, the postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers—allows clinicians and researchers to use sudomotor function testing to assess dysfunction of the autonomic nervous systems, through electrochemical skin conductance.

===Parasympathetic nervous system===

The parasympathetic nervous system has been said to promote a &quot;rest and digest&quot; response, promotes calming of the nerves return to regular function, and enhancing digestion. Functions of nerves within the parasympathetic nervous system include:
* Dilating blood vessels leading to the GI tract, increasing the blood flow.
* Constricting the bronchiolar diameter when the need for oxygen has diminished
* Dedicated cardiac branches of the vagus and thoracic spinal accessory nerves impart parasympathetic control of the heart (myocardium)
* Constriction of the pupil and contraction of the ciliary muscles, facilitating accommodation and allowing for closer vision
* Stimulating salivary gland secretion, and accelerates peristalsis, mediating digestion of food and, indirectly, the absorption of nutrients
* Sexual. Nerves of the peripheral nervous system are involved in the erection of genital tissues via the pelvic splanchnic nerves 2–4. They are also responsible for stimulating sexual arousal.

===Enteric nervous system===

The enteric nervous system is the intrinsic nervous system of the gastrointestinal system. It has been described as the &quot;second brain of the human body&quot;. Its functions include:
* Sensing chemical and mechanical changes in the gut
* Regulating secretions in the gut
* Controlling peristalsis and some other movements

===Neurotransmitters===


At the effector organs, sympathetic ganglionic neurons release noradrenaline (norepinephrine), along with other cotransmitters such as ATP, to act on adrenergic receptors, with the exception of the sweat glands and the adrenal medulla:
* Acetylcholine is the preganglionic neurotransmitter for both divisions of the ANS, as well as the postganglionic neurotransmitter of parasympathetic neurons. Nerves that release acetylcholine are said to be cholinergic. In the parasympathetic system, ganglionic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter to stimulate muscarinic receptors.
* At the adrenal medulla, there is no postsynaptic neuron. Instead, the presynaptic neuron releases acetylcholine to act on nicotinic receptors. Stimulation of the adrenal medulla releases adrenaline (epinephrine) into the bloodstream, which acts on adrenoceptors, thereby indirectly mediating or mimicking sympathetic activity.

A full table is at Table of neurotransmitter actions in the ANS.

===Autonomic nervous system and the immune system===
Recent studies indicate that ANS activation is critical for regulating the local and systemic immune-inflammatory responses and may influence acute stroke outcomes. Therapeutic approaches modulating the activation of the ANS or the immune-inflammatory response could promote neurologic recovery after stroke.

== History ==
The specialised system of the autonomic nervous system was recognised by Galen.

In 1665, Thomas Willis used the terminology, and in 1900, John Newport Langley used the term, defining the two divisions as the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

==Caffeine effects==
Caffeine is a bioactive ingredient found in commonly consumed beverages such as coffee, tea, and sodas. Short-term physiological effects of caffeine include increased blood pressure and sympathetic nerve outflow. Habitual consumption of caffeine may inhibit physiological short-term effects. Consumption of caffeinated espresso increases parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers; however, decaffeinated espresso inhibits parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers. It is possible that other bioactive ingredients in decaffeinated espresso may also contribute to the inhibition of parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers.

Caffeine is capable of increasing work capacity while individuals perform strenuous tasks. In one study, caffeine provoked a greater maximum heart rate while a strenuous task was being performed compared to a placebo. This tendency is likely due to caffeine&#x27;s ability to increase sympathetic nerve outflow. Furthermore, this study found that recovery after intense exercise was slower when caffeine was consumed prior to exercise. This finding is indicative of caffeine&#x27;s tendency to inhibit parasympathetic activity in non-habitual consumers. The caffeine-stimulated increase in nerve activity is likely to evoke other physiological effects as the body attempts to maintain homeostasis.

The effects of caffeine on parasympathetic activity may vary depending on the position of the individual when autonomic responses are measured. One study found that the seated position inhibited autonomic activity after caffeine consumption (75 mg); however, parasympathetic activity increased in the supine position. This finding may explain why some habitual caffeine consumers (75 mg or less) do not experience short-term effects of caffeine if their routine requires many hours in a seated position. It is important to note that the data supporting increased parasympathetic activity in the supine position was derived from an experiment involving participants between the ages of 25 and 30 who were considered healthy and sedentary. Caffeine may influence autonomic activity differently for individuals who are more active or elderly.

<text>The Soul Stirrers were an American gospel music group, whose career spans over eighty years. The group was a pioneer in the development of the quartet style of gospel, and a major influence on Soul, R&amp;B, Doo-wop, and Southern soul, some of the secular music that owed much to gospel.

==Biography==
===Formation===
The group was formed by (Silas) Roy Crain, launching his first quartet who sang in a jubilee style, in 1926 in Trinity, Texas, United States. In the early 1930s, after Crain moved to Houston, he joined an existing group on the condition that it change its name to &quot;The Soul Stirrers&quot;: this name yields from the description of one of Roy Crain&#x27;s earlier quartets as &quot;soul-stirring&quot;. Among the members of that group there was R.H. (Rebert) Harris, who soon became its musical leader. The Soul Stirrers, formed as a jubilee quartet, transformed their sound, influenced by hard gospel singers such as Mahalia Jackson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.

===Style===
Rebert Harris, also from Trinity, Texas, brought several changes to The Soul Stirrers that affected gospel quartet singing generally. He used a falsetto style that had its antecedents in African music, but which was new to the popular jubilee singing style of the time. He pioneered the &quot;swing lead&quot;, in which two singers would share the job of leading the song, allowing virtuoso singers to increase the emotional intensity of the song as the lead passed between them without disturbing the four part harmony. That innovation led The Soul Stirrers, while still called a quartet, to acquire five members.

The Soul Stirrers made other important changes in those years: ad-libbing lyrics, singing in delayed time, and repeating words in the background as both a rhythmic and emotional support for the lead singers. The Soul Stirrers along with other quartet performers, dropped the &quot;flatfooted&quot; style of jubilee quartets before them and expanded their repertoire from spirituals and traditional hymns to the newer gospel compositions. The group also loosened the rigid arrangements that jubilee quartets had favored to permit individual singers within the group more space for individual development.

===Recordings and performances===
In 1936, Alan Lomax recorded The Soul Stirrers for the Library of Congress&#x27;s American music project, and those four unissued recordings are in the American Folklife Center collection today. They later moved to Chicago, where they broadcast a weekly radio show (WIND) with other famous groups including The Golden Gate Quartet and &quot;The Famous Blue Jay Singers&quot;. As the gospel quartet style of singing became more popular, groups would perform in competitions called &quot;song battles&quot; to further increase the genre&#x27;s popularity.

As World War II began, it became more difficult for many gospel quartet groups to make a living. It resulted in some quartets supplementing their income by doing live performances at churches, schools, and neighborhood centers. Despite the economic situation, throughout the 1940s and leading into the 1950s, many gospel quartet groups were able to pursue their careers successfully. The Soul Stirrers&#x27; nationwide touring gained them an even larger audience.

The Soul Stirrers signed with Specialty Records, where they recorded a number of tracks, including &quot;By and By&quot; and &quot;In That Awful Hour&quot;. Harris quit in late 1950 to form a new group, citing dissatisfaction with what he viewed as the crookedness of the business and immoral behavior by musicians he saw on the &quot;Gospel Highway&quot; touring circuit. He was briefly replaced on lead by Paul Foster, then by Sam Cooke. Cooke joined the group at 19 and served as lead vocalist from 1950 to 1956.

One of the early singles with Cooke was &quot;Jesus Gave Me Water&quot;, a major hit that brought The Soul Stirrers acclaim. Thomas L. Breuster was replaced by Bob King and, briefly, Julius Cheeks. When Cooke left in 1957 to pursue a solo career in pop music, The Soul Stirrers&#x27; preeminence in gospel was essentially over, though a brief period of success with Johnnie Taylor sustained the group for a time. The group made several appearances performing on &quot;TV Gospel Time&quot; in early 1960s. Various line-ups continued touring and recording throughout the last half of the century to a small and devoted following.

===Awards===
The group – and all of its members – was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 as one of rock&#x27;s &#x27;Early Influences&#x27;, and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000. In 2022 their 1950 recording &quot;Jesus Gave Me Water&quot; was selected by the US Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

<doc id="166191" wikidata="Q1406773" url="?curid=166191" title="Lauch Faircloth">
<text>Duncan McLauchlin &quot;Lauch&quot; Faircloth (January 14, 1928 – September 14, 2023) was an American politician from North Carolina who served as a Republican member of the United States Senate for one term from 1993 to 1999. He was a member of the Democratic Party for most of his career in North Carolina politics until he joined the Republican Party in 1991.

Faircloth began his career as a political consultant to Senator W. Kerr Scott and Governor Terry Sanford. He was appointed to the state highway commission during Sanford&#x27;s tenure and served as its chairman from 1969 to 1973. He then served as North Carolina Secretary of Commerce before unsuccessfully running for governor in 1984. In 1991, Faircloth switched parties and became a Republican. He won the Republican nomination for the 1992 U.S. Senate election and defeated incumbent Senator Terry Sanford, his former boss, in the general election.

As a U.S. senator, Faircloth staunchly criticized President Bill Clinton and was a prominent figure in the Senate Whitewater investigations. He was also critical of first lady Hillary Clinton and called on her to testify in front of Congress. In 1997, Faircloth came to national attention after he stripped Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry of his powers to deal with a large deficit. His decision angered Barry and led to D.C. residents marching to North Carolina to protest. Although his political standing was damaged, Faircloth attempted to seek a second term in 1998, losing to Democrat John Edwards in the general election.

== Early life ==
Born on January 14, 1928, in Sampson County, North Carolina, Faircloth was the youngest of four sons born to James and Mary Faircloth; James owned a 2,500-acre cotton farm, which Lauch inherited after James&#x27; death. He attended Roseboro High School and graduated in 1945. He attended High Point University but dropped out in his freshman year after his father suffered a stroke.

In 1950, Faircloth purchased 1,000 acres of land in Sampson County, which he turned into a prominent cattle and hog farm. He also engaged in business ventures such as construction and auto dealerships. One impetus for his political activism was his disagreement with the increasing regulations targeting large hog farming operations such as his, fueled by an environmentalist and populist backlash.

== Early political career ==
Faircloth began his career as a Democrat. He worked on W. Kerr Scott&#x27;s successful 1948 gubernatorial campaign and his 1954 U.S. Senate campaign. Scott rewarded Faircloth by helping him get out of service in the Korean War via a hardship discharge in 1955. In 1960, Faircloth worked on Terry Sanford&#x27;s successful gubernatorial bid, and afterwards Sanford rewarded Faircloth with an appointment to the state highway commission, on which he served from 1961 to 1965. After helping Robert W. Scott in his bid for the governorship in 1968, Scott named Faircloth chairman of the commission, replacing Joe Hunt Jr., which he served as from 1969 to 1973.

When Jim Hunt was elected governor in 1976, he selected Faircloth serve as Secretary of Commerce. As Commerce Secretary, he was paid $32,580 a year. Manufacturing jobs in North Carolina grew 8.4 percent under Faircloth, the third highest in the southeast. The weekly wage increased from $170 when he took office to $297 when he left, which was virtually unchanged from national wages.

=== 1984 gubernatorial campaign === 
Faircloth, aspiring to the governor&#x27;s office himself, resigned as Commerce Secretary in June 1983. On July 25, he announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the 1984 gubernatorial election. While flying to a campaign stop on August 22, 1983, the small twin-engine plane he was aboard crashed into the Catawba River. According to one passenger, Faircloth forced the plane&#x27;s door open and helped all the occupants escape moments before the plane exploded. After the crash, Faircloth was transferred to Marion General Hospital for minor burns to his right hand.

In December 1983, Faircloth was endorsed by Terry Sanford, a former governor and the then-president of Duke University who had appointed Faircloth to the state highway commission 20 years prior. Sanford said that Faircloth was &quot;an old and trusted friend&quot; and &quot;the best qualified candidate we have in North Carolina&quot;. Faircloth was defeated in the 1984 primary by Rufus Edmisten, who lost the general election to congressman James G. Martin. Official Board of Elections reports showed that Faircloth spent $2,100,605.70 on his campaign.

=== Later activities ===
Faircloth was considered a potential candidate for the Senate seat being vacated by Senator John Porter East in 1986. He initially declined, but in November 1985 he said he was reconsidering his decision and launched a campaign committee. But in January 1986, he announced he would not run after Sanford entered the race; Sanford would go on to win the election. Afterward, Faircloth grew close with Republican Senator Jesse Helms and supported Helms&#x27; 1990 reelection campaign. On February 14, 1991, Faircloth switched his party registration to Republican, saying that Democrats had become &quot;too liberal&quot; and hinted at a potential run for the U.S. Senate in 1992, vying to face former ally Terry Sanford in the election.

== U.S. Senate ==
In April 1991, Faircloth announced he would run for the Republican Party nomination for the 1992 U.S. Senate election. He enjoyed the support of Senator Helms&#x27;s political organization, the National Congressional Club, and defeated Charlotte mayor Sue Myrick and former congressman Walter E. Johnston III in the primary. Sanford, the incumbent Senator, had helped Faircloth raise money for his failed gubernatorial bid in 1984, but provoked Faircloth&#x27;s anger two years later when Sanford allegedly denigrated Faircloth&#x27;s earlier bid for the Senate with alleged comments dismissing Faircloth&#x27;s chances in a statewide contest against him.

A year prior to the election, Sanford voted against authorizing military force in the Gulf War, which damaged his political standing. Faircloth attacked Sanford as a tax-and-spend liberal, and despite a mediocre performance in a televised debate that September, Faircloth won the seat by a vote of 1,297,892 (50%) to 1,194,015 (46%).

=== 103rd Congress === 

Faircloth was sworn in as North Carolina&#x27;s junior U.S. Senator on January 5, 1993. He joked that he wanted to be known as the &quot;conservative&quot; senator from North Carolina; in comparison to the state&#x27;s other seat held by the arch-conservative Helms. 

In his first two weeks in the Senate, Faircloth was appointed to serve on the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services. While on the Armed Service Committee, he opposed the inclusion of homosexuals in the military and claimed the number of AIDS-infected people in the military would only increase if it were to happen. He opposed the Clinton administration&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy and said it was a result of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s lack of military experience. That remark was condemned by Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said that, &quot;it is unfair to single out the president in this regard&quot;.

On the Environment and Public Works Committee, Faircloth sought to weaken anti-pollution measures regulating farms. He introduced a measure that would have lowered fines issued to farms that have polluted wetlands and proposed another measure that would have stopped the flow of federal money to environmental monitors. The committee did not vote on either measure. In 1994, the committee adopted a third measure by Faircloth – legislation that would have made it more difficult for farmers suspected of polluting to be taken to court – but it did not become law. Some claimed there was a conflict of interest in Faircloth&#x27;s policy proposals, given that he was a farmer, but he claimed he was working to benefit all farmers and not just himself.

In January 1994, Faircloth was among eight Republican senators to call for a congressional inquiry into the role President Bill Clinton had in the Whitewater controversy. In February, he was the lone Senator on the Senate Banking Committee to vote against approving Ricki Tigert as head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He argued that Tigert, who was appointed by Clinton, was not going to help uncover information in the investigation. Later that year, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; praised Faircloth&#x27;s aggressive efforts to uncover information. In June 1994, he proposed amending the House and Community Development Act to include a work-for-rent requirement, but it was voted down by Senate Democrats. Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois argued that his plan was &quot;dictatorial&quot;, and branded Faircloth as a communist.

Faircloth was often criticized for accepting thousands of dollars from several political action committees, despite having criticized them during his 1992 Senate campaign.

=== 104th Congress === 
When the 104th United States Congress convened in January 1995, Faircloth was named chairman of the United States Senate Environment Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate and Nuclear Safety and the United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development. In May, Faircloth and U.S. Senator John Warner of Virginia proposed implementing Interstate 73&#x27;s entry into South Carolina, but the proposal angered U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who effectively killed the deal after calling for a session in the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. In September 1995, Faircloth was the lone Republican Senator to join eleven Senate Democratics to vote against a landmark welfare spending bill, calling it a &quot;pot of Pablum&quot;. In January 1996, Faircloth earned the Taxpayers&#x27; Friend Award from the bipartisan National Taxpayers Union.

In April 1995, Faircloth accused the Clinton administration of pushing out Republican Sheila Bair as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to protect first lady Hillary Clinton&#x27;s trading profits. In response, the White House denounced his accusation as &quot;a baseless and irresponsible charge&quot;. When the United States Senate Whitewater Committee was established in May 1995, Faircloth sought to subpoena first lady Hillary Clinton. In a letter to the CFTC, Faircloth asked for records involving Clinton from 1978 to 1980. He called on Clinton to testify in front of Congress. In 1996, Faircloth delayed the nomination of Brooksley Born to chair the CFTC, demanding that he receive written assurances that would recuse Born from any investigations involving Hillary Clinton and Whitewater.

In 1996, Faircloth delayed the nomination of Susan Oki Mollway to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, arguing that she had &quot;very, very liberal ideas&quot; and raised questions over her affiliation with the American Civil Liberties Union. The delay led to Mollway having to wait over two years to be confirmed in the post. Hawaii&#x27;s senior Senator Daniel Inouye was critical of the delay.

=== 105th Congress ===

In September 1997, Faircloth voted to eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, although it failed with 77 Senators voting against the proposal.

In 1997, Faircloth, then-chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, stripped Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry of his authority to deal with a large deficit, handing it to a newly established District of Columbia Financial Control Board, and placing several city agencies into a receivership. The move angered Barry, who called it a &quot;rape of democracy&quot;. In response, a crowd of around 600 protesters, 400 of whom marched from D.C., surrounded Faircloth&#x27;s home in protest at his decision, although he was not home.

In April 1998, Henry Woods, a United States federal judge from Arkansas, alleged to &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; that in 1995 an aide to Faircloth came to him and asked for Woods&#x27; financial disclosures. The request was granted two weeks before Woods was to rule on whether or not Ken Starr had jurisdiction to prosecute key Whitewater figures. Woods said that he considered the request to be &quot;a crude attempt to intimidate me&quot;, and called on the United States Department of Justice to investigate. Around this time Faircloth sponsored an amendment to the Housing Act of 1937 to put a cap on the number of public housing units that are allowed to be operated on a federal level.

Official Senate records showed that between January 1993 and June 1998, Faircloth missed 68 out of 2,122 roll-call votes.

==== 1998 reelection campaign ==== 

Faircloth ran for reelection in 1998. He defeated Leonard Plyler and Steve Franks in the Republican primary and faced political newcomer, Democrat John Edwards, in the general election. In an August 1998 poll by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy, Faircloth&#x27;s approval rating among voters was 50 percent, with 44 percent disapproving. Despite originally being the marginal favorite, Faircloth lost his seat to Edwards by a vote of 1,029,237 (51%) to 945,943 (47%). In conceding to Edwards, Faircloth admitted to his supporters, &quot;I feel that I let you down...because we should have won.&quot; Afterwards, Barry said Faircloth had been &quot;so busy picking on me and the residents of Washington, D.C. that he neglected his constituents in North Carolina. Now he can go back and deal with the pigs. Goodbye, Faircloth.&quot;

== Post-Senate career ==
After leaving the Senate, Faircloth moved back to his home in Clinton, North Carolina. When Jesse Helms announced he would retire from the Senate after the 2002 election, Faircloth considered entering the race to replace him. He announced in September 2001 that he would not run.

== Personal life and death ==
Faircloth married and divorced Lady Lynn Talton, before marrying Nancy Bryan Faircloth in 1967, with whom he had one daughter. He divorced Bryan in 1986.

Faircloth died at his home from natural causes on September 14, 2023, at age 95.

==Electoral history==
 Write-in and minor candidate notes: in 1992, Bruce Kimball received 23 votes and Mary Ann Zakutney received 13 votes.

<text>A petrol engine (gasoline engine in American and Canadian English) is an internal combustion engine designed to run on petrol (gasoline). Petrol engines can often be adapted to also run on fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas and ethanol blends (such as &quot;E10&quot; and &quot;E85&quot;). They may be designed to run on petrol with a higher octane rating, as sold at petrol stations.

Most petrol engines use spark ignition, unlike diesel engines which run on diesel fuel and typically use compression ignition. Another key difference to diesel engines is that petrol engines typically have a lower compression ratio.

==History==

The first practical petrol engine was built in 1876 in Germany by Nicolaus August Otto and Eugen Langen, although there had been earlier attempts by Étienne Lenoir in 1860, Siegfried Marcus in 1864 and George Brayton in 1873.

==Design==

=== Thermodynamic cycle ===
Most petrol engines use either the four-stroke Otto cycle or the two-stroke cycle. Petrol engines have also been produced using the Miller cycle and Atkinson cycle.

=== Layout ===
Most petrol-powered piston engines are straight engines or V engines. However, flat engines, W engines and other layouts are sometimes used. 

Wankel engines are classified by the number of rotors used.

=== Compression ratio ===
===Cooling===
Petrol engines are either air-cooled or water-cooled.

===Ignition===

Petrol engines use spark ignition. High voltage for the spark this may be provided by a magneto or an ignition coil. In modern car engines, the ignition timing is managed by an electronic Engine Control Unit. Ignition modules can also function as a rev limiter in some cases to prevent overrevving and the consequences of it, such as valve float and connecting rod failure.

=== Primer ===

Primers may be used to help start the engine. They can draw fuel from fuel tanks and vaporize fuel directly into piston cylinders. Engines are difficult to start during cold weather, and the fuel primer helps because otherwise there will not be enough heat available to vaporize the fuel in the carburetor.

== Power output and efficiency ==
The power output of small- and medium-sized petrol engines (along with equivalent engines using other fuels) is usually measured in kilowatts or horsepower.

Typically, petrol engines have a thermodynamic efficiency of about 20-30% (approximately half that of some diesel engines).

==Applications==
Applications of petrol engines include automobiles, motorcycles, aircraft, motorboats and small engines (such as lawn mowers, chainsaws and portable generators). Petrol engines have also been used as &quot;pony engines&quot;, a type of engine used to start a larger, stationary diesel engine.

<doc id="166200" wikidata="Q837795" url="?curid=166200" title="Jewish philosophy">
<text>Jewish philosophy () includes all philosophy carried out by Jews or in relation to the religion of Judaism. Until the modern &quot;Haskalah&quot; (Jewish Enlightenment) and Jewish emancipation, Jewish philosophy was preoccupied with attempts to reconcile coherent new ideas into the tradition of Rabbinic Judaism, thus organizing emergent ideas that are not necessarily Jewish into a uniquely Jewish scholastic framework and worldview. With their admission into broader modern society, Jews with secular educations embraced or developed entirely new philosophies to meet the world&#x27;s demands in which they now found themselves.

Medieval rediscovery of ancient Greek philosophy among the &quot;Geonim&quot; of 10th-century Babylonian academies brought rationalist philosophy into Biblical-Talmudic Judaism. During the &quot;Geonic&quot; period, philosophy was generally in competition with Kabbalah. Both schools would become part of classic Rabbinic literature, though the decline of scholastic rationalism coincided with historical events that drew Jews to the Kabbalistic approach. For Ashkenazi Jews, emancipation and encounters with secular thought from the 18th century onwards altered how philosophy was viewed. Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities had comparatively later, more ambivalent interactions with secular cultures than those of Western Europe. In the varied responses to modernity, Jewish philosophical ideas were developed across a range of emerging religious movements. These developments could be seen as either the continuation of or breaks from the canon of Rabbinic philosophy of the Middle Ages and the other historical dialectic aspects of Jewish thought, resulting in diverse contemporary Jewish attitudes to philosophical methods.

== Ancient Jewish philosophy ==

=== Philo of Alexandria ===

Philo attempted to fuse and harmonize Greek and Jewish philosophy through allegory, which he learned from Jewish exegesis and Stoicism. Philo attempted to make his philosophy the means of defending and justifying Jewish religious &quot;truths&quot;. These &quot;truths&quot; he regarded as fixed and determinate, and philosophy was used as an aid to &quot;truth&quot;, and a means of arriving at it. To this end Philo chose from philosophical tenets of Greeks, refusing those that did not harmonize with Judaism such as Aristotle&#x27;s doctrine of the &quot;eternity and indestructibility of the world&quot;.

== Jewish scholarship after destruction of Second Temple ==
With the Roman destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Second Temple Judaism was in disarray. Still, Jewish traditions were preserved especially thanks to the shrewd maneuvers of Johanan ben Zakai, who saved the Sanhedrin and moved it to Yavne. Philosophical speculation was not a central part of Rabbinic Judaism, but some have seen the Mishnah as a philosophical work. Rabbi Akiva has also been viewed as a philosopher figure. He is credited with the following teachings in the Mishnah:

# &quot;How favored is man, for he was created after an image. For in an image, Elohim made man.&quot;(Gen. ix. 6)
# &quot;All things are foreseen [by God], yet the freedom to choose is given [unto man], and the world is judged on [its] merits, while everything is according to the preponderance of [good or bad] works.&quot; 

After the Bar Kokhba revolt, rabbinic scholars gathered in Tiberias and Safed to re-assemble and re-assess Judaism, its laws, theology, liturgy, beliefs, and leadership structure. In 219 CE, the Sura Academy (from which Jewish Kalam emerged many centuries later) was founded by Abba Arika. For the next five centuries, Talmudic academies focused on reconstituting Judaism, and little, if any, philosophic investigation was pursued.

=== Who influences whom? ===

Rabbinic Judaism had limited philosophical activity until it was challenged by Islam, Karaite Judaism, and Christianity—with Tanakh, Mishnah, and Talmud, there was previously no explicit requirement for a philosophic framework. From an economic viewpoint, Radhanite trade dominance was being usurped by coordinated Christian and Islamic forced conversions and torture, compelling Jewish scholars to apprehend nascent economic threats. These investigations yielded intellectual exchange between Jewish and Islamic scholars in jurisprudence, mathematics, astronomy, logic, and philosophy. Jewish scholars influenced Islamic scholars, and Islamic scholars influenced Jewish scholars. Contemporary scholars continue to debate who was Muslim and who was Jewish—some &quot;Islamic scholars&quot; were Jewish scholars prior to forced conversion to Islam, and there were episodic willing conversions of Jewish scholars to Islam (such as Abdullah ibn Salam). In contrast, others later reverted to Judaism, and still others, born and raised as Jews, were ambiguous in their public religious beliefs, such as ibn al-Rawandi. However, they lived according to the customs of their Muslim neighbors.

Around 700 CE, ʿAmr ibn ʿUbayd Abu ʿUthman al-Basri introduced two streams of thought that influenced Jewish, Islamic, and Christian scholars:
# &quot;Qadariyah&quot;
# &quot;Bahshamiyya&quot; &quot;Muʿtazila&quot;

The story of the &quot;Bahshamiyya Muʿtazila&quot; and &quot;Qadariyah&quot; is as important, if not more so, as the intellectual symbiosis of Judaism and Islam in Islamic Spain.

Around 733 CE, Mar Natronai ben Habibai moved to Kairouan, then to Spain, transcribing the Talmud &quot;Bavli&quot; for the Academy at Kairouan from memory—later taking a copy with him to Spain.

==== Karaism ====

Borrowing from the &quot;Mutakallamin&quot; of Basra, the Karaites were the first Jewish group to subject Judaism to &quot;Muʿtazila&quot;. Rejecting the Talmud and Rabbinical tradition, Karaites took radical liberty to reinterpret the Tanakh. This meant abandoning foundational Jewish belief structures. Some scholars suggest that the major impetus for the formation of Karaism was a reaction to the rapid rise of Shia Islam, which recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith but claimed it detracted from monotheism by deferring to rabbinic authority. Karaites absorbed certain aspects of Jewish sects such as the followers of Abu Isa (Shi&#x27;ism), Maliki (Sunnis), and Yudghanites (Sufis), who were influenced by East-Islamic scholarship yet deferred to the Ash&#x27;ari when contemplating the sciences.

==== Philosophic synthesis begins ====
The spread of Islam throughout the Middle East and North Africa rendered Islamic much that was previously Jewish. Greek philosophy, science, medicine, and mathematics were absorbed by Jewish scholars living in the Arab world due to Arabic translations of those texts in remnants of the Library of Alexandria. Early Jewish converts to Islam brought with them stories from Jewish tradition, known as &quot;Isra&#x27;iliyyat&quot;, which told of the &quot;Banu Isra&#x27;il&quot;: the pious men of ancient Israel. One of the most famous early mystics of Sufism, Hasan of Basra, introduced numerous &quot;Isra&#x27;iliyyat&quot; into Islamic scholarship—stories that went on to become representative of Islamic mystical ideas of the piety of Sufism.

Hai Gaon of Pumbedita Academy began a new phase in Jewish scholarship and investigation (&quot;hakirah&quot;); Hai Gaon augments Talmudic scholarship with non-Jewish studies. Hai Gaon was a savant with an exact knowledge of the theological movements of his time, so much so that Moses ibn Ezra called him a mutakallim. Hai was competent in arguing with followers of Qadariyyah and Mutazilites, sometimes adopting their polemic methods. Through correspondence with Talmudic Academies at Kairouan, Cordoba, and Lucena, Hai Gaon passes along his discoveries to Talmudic scholars therein.

The teachings of the Brethren of Purity were carried to the West by the Cordovan hadith scholar and alchemist Maslama al-Qurtubi (died 964), where they would be of central importance to the Jewish philosophers of Islamic Spain. One of the themes emphasized by the Brethren of Purity and adopted by most Spanish Jewish philosophers is the microcosm-macrocosm analogy. From the 10th century on, Spain became a center of philosophical learning as is reflected by the explosion of philosophical inquiry among Jews, Muslims and Christians.

== Jewish philosophy before Maimonides ==

=== &quot;Hiwi the Heretic&quot; ===
According to Sa&#x27;adya Gaon, the Jewish community of Balkh (Afghanistan) was divided into two groups: &quot;Jews&quot; and &quot;people that are called Jews&quot;; Hiwi al-Balkhi was a member of the latter. Hiwi is generally considered to be the very first &quot;Jewish&quot; philosopher to subject the Pentateuch to critical analysis. Hiwi is viewed by some scholars as an intellectually conflicted man torn between Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Gnostic Christianity, and Manichaean thought.

Hiwi espoused the belief that miraculous acts, described in the Pentateuch, are simply examples of people using their skills of reasoning to undertake, and perform, seemingly miraculous acts. As examples of this position, he argued that the parting of the Red Sea was a natural phenomenon, and that Moses&#x27; claim to greatness lay merely in his ability to calculate the right moment for the crossing. He also emphasized that the Egyptian magicians were able to reproduce several of Moses&#x27; &quot;miracles,&quot; proving that they could not have been so unique. According to scholars, Hiwi&#x27;s gravest mistake was having the Pentateuch redacted to reflect his own views - then had those redacted texts, which became popular, distributed to children. Since his views contradicted the views of both Rabbanite and Karaite scholars, Hiwi was declared a heretic. In this context, however, we can also regard Hiwi, while flawed, as the very first critical biblical commentator; zealous rationalistic views of Hiwi parallel those of Ibn al-Rawandi.

Saʿadya Gaon dedicated an entire treatise, written in rhyming Hebrew, to a refutation of Ḥīwī&#x27;s arguments, two fragments of which, preserved in the Cairo Geniza, have been published (Davidson, 1915; Schirmann, 1965). Ḥīwī&#x27;s criticisms are also noted in Abraham ibn Ezra&#x27;s commentary on the Pentateuch. Sa&#x27;adya Gaon denounced Hiwi as an extreme rationalist, a &quot;Mulhidun&quot;, or atheist/deviator. Abraham Ibn Daud described HIwi as a sectarian who &quot;denied the Torah, yet used it to formulate a new Torah of his liking&quot;.

=== Sa&#x27;adya Gaon ===
&quot;Saadia Gaon, son of a proselyte, is considered the greatest early Jewish philosopher after Solomon. During his early years in Tulunid Egypt, the Fatimid Caliphate ruled Egypt; the leaders of the Tulunids were Ismaili Imams. Their influence upon the Jewish academies of Egypt resonate in the works of Sa&#x27;adya. Sa&#x27;adya&#x27;s &quot;Emunoth ve-Deoth&quot; (&quot;Beliefs and Opinions&quot;) was originally called &quot;Kitab al-Amanat wal-l&#x27;tikadat&quot; (&quot;Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma&quot;); it was the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of Judaism, completed at Sura Academy in 933 CE.&quot;

Little known is that Saadia traveled to Tiberias in 915CE to study with Abū &#x27;l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ, &quot;a Jewish theologian and Bible translator. He is not mentioned in any Jewish source, and apart from the Andalusian heresiographer and polemicist Ibn Hazm, who mentions him as a Jewish mutakallim (rational theologian), our main source of information is the &quot;Kitāb al-Tanbīh&quot; by the Muslim historian al-Masʿūdī (d. 956). In his brief survey of Arabic translations of the Bible, al-Masʿūdī states that the Israelites rely for exegesis and translation of the Hebrew books—i.e., the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, twenty-four books in all, he says—on a number of Israelites whom they praise highly, almost all of whom he has met in person. He mentions Abū ʾl-Kathīr as one of them, and also Saadia (&quot;Saʿīd ibn Yaʿqūb al-Fayyūmī&quot;). Regardless of what we do not know, Saadia traveled to Tiberias (home of the learned scribes and exegetes) to learn and he chose Abū &#x27;l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabariya. The extent of Abū ʾl-Kathīr&#x27;s influence on Saadia&#x27;s thought cannot be established, however.&quot;

Abū ʾl-Kathīr&#x27;s profession is also unclear. al-Masʿūdī calls him a &quot;kātib&quot;, which has been variously interpreted as secretary, government official, (biblical) scribe, Masorete, and book copyist. For lack of further information, some scholars have tried to identify Abū ʾl-Kathīr with the Hebrew grammarian Abū ʿAlī Judah ben ʿAllān, likewise of Tiberias, who seems to have been a Karaite Jew. However, al-Masūdī unequivocally describes Abu ʾl-Kathīr (as well as his student Saadia) as an ashmaʿthī (Rabbanite).

In &quot;Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma&quot; Saadia declares the rationality of the Jewish religion with the caveat that reason must capitulate wherever it contradicts tradition. Dogma takes precedence over reason. Saadia closely followed the rules of the Muʿtazila school of Abu Ali al-Jubba&#x27;i in composing his works. It was Saadia who laid foundations for Jewish rationalist theology which built upon the work of the Muʿtazila, thereby shifting Rabbinic Judaism from mythical explanations of the rabbis to reasoned explanations of the intellect. Saadia advanced the criticisms of Muʿtazila by Ibn al-Rawandi.

=== David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas ===

David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas was author of the earliest known Jewish philosophical work of the Middle Ages, a commentary on the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;; he is regarded as the father of Jewish medieval philosophy. Al-Mukkamas was first to introduce the &quot;methods&quot; of Kalam into Judaism and the first Jew to mention Aristotle in his writings. He was a proselyte of Rabbinic Judaism (not Karaite Judaism, as some argue); al-Mukkamas was a student of physician, and renowned Christian philosopher, Hana. His close interaction with Hana, and his familial affiliation with Islam gave al-Mukkamas a unique view of religious belief and theology.

In 1898 Abraham Harkavy discovered, in Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, fifteen of the twenty chapters of David&#x27;s philosophical work entitled &quot;Ishrun Maḳalat&quot; (Twenty Chapters) of which 15 survive. One of the oldest surviving witnesses to early Kalām, it begins with epistemological investigations, turns to proofs of the creation of the world and the subsequent existence of a Creator, discusses the unity of the Creator (including the divine attributes), and concludes with theodicy (humanity and revelation) and a refutation of other religions (mostly lost).

In 915 CE, Sa&#x27;adya Gaon left for Palestine, where, according to al-Masʿūdī (Tanbīh, 113), he perfected his education at the feet of Abū &#x27;l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabari (d. 320/932). The latter is also mentioned by Ibn Ḥazm in his K. al-Fiṣlal wa &#x27;l-niḥal, iii, 171, as being, together with Dāwūd ibn Marwān al-Muqammiṣ and Sa&#x27;adya himself, one of the mutakallimūn of the Jews.

Since al-Muqammiṣ made few references to specifically Jewish issues and very little of his work was translated from Arabic into Hebrew, he was largely forgotten by Jewish tradition. Nonetheless, he had a significant impact on subsequent Jewish philosophical followers of the Kalām, such as Saʿadya Gaon.

=== Samuel ibn Naghrillah ===
Samuel ibn Naghrillah, born in Mérida, Spain, lived in Córdoba and was a child prodigy and student of Hanoch ben Moshe. Samuel ibn Naghrillah, Hasdai ibn Shaprut, and Moshe ben Hanoch founded the Lucena Yeshiva that produced such brilliant scholars as Isaac ibn Ghiyyat and Maimon ben Yosef, the father of Maimonides. Ibn Naghrillah&#x27;s son, Yosef, provided refuge for two sons of Hezekiah Gaon; Daud Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi and Yitzhak Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi. Though not a philosopher, he did build the infrastructure to allow philosophers to thrive. In 1070 the gaon Isaac ben Moses ibn Sakri of Denia, Spain traveled to the East and acted as &quot;rosh yeshivah&quot; of the Baghdad Academy.

=== Solomon ibn Gabirol ===

Solomon ibn Gabirol was born in Málaga then moved to Valencia. Ibn Gabirol was one of the first teachers of Neoplatonism in Europe. His role has been compared to that of Philo. Ibn Gabirol occidentalized Greco-Arabic philosophy and restored it to Europe. The philosophical teachings of Philo and ibn Gabirol were largely ignored by fellow Jews; the parallel may be extended by adding that Philo and ibn Gabirol both exercised considerable influence in secular circles; Philo upon early Christianity and Ibn Gabirol upon the scholars of medieval Christianity. Christian scholars, including Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, defer to him frequently.

=== Abraham bar-Hiyya Ha-Nasi ===

Abraham bar Hiyya, of Barcelona and later Arles-Provence, was a student of his father Hiyya al-Daudi and one of the most important figures in the scientific movement which made the Jews of Provence, Spain and Italy the intermediaries between Averroism, Muʿtazila and Christian Europe. He aided this scientific movement by original works, translations and as interpreter for another translator, Plato Tiburtinus. Bar-Hiyya&#x27;s best student was v. His philosophical works are &quot;Meditation of the Soul&quot;, an ethical work written from a rationalistic religious viewpoint, and an apologetic epistle addressed to Judah ben Barzillai.

=== Hibat Allah ===
Originally known by his Hebrew name Nethanel Baruch ben Melech al-Balad, Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī, known as &quot;Hibat Allah&quot;, was a Jewish philosopher and physicist and father-in-law of Maimonides who converted to Islam in his twilight years - once head of the Baghdad Yeshiva and considered the leading philosopher of Iraq.

Historians differ over the motive for his conversion to Islam. Some suggest it was a reaction to a social slight inflicted upon him because he was a Jew, while others suggest he was forcibly converted at the edge of a sword (which prompted Maimonides to comment upon Anusim). Despite his conversion to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna&#x27;s teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.

His writings include &quot;Kitāb al-Muʿtabar&quot; (&quot;The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection&quot;); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet, written in Arabic using Hebrew aleph bet; and the treatise &quot;On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime.&quot; According to Hibat Allah, &quot;Kitāb al-Muʿtabar&quot; consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work.

=== Nethan&#x27;el al-Fayyumi ===

Natan&#x27;el al-Fayyumi of Yemen, was the twelfth-century author of &quot;Bustan al-Uqul&quot; (&quot;Garden of Intellects&quot;), a Jewish version of Ismaili Shi&#x27;i doctrines. Like the Ismailis, Natan&#x27;el al-Fayyumi argued that God sent different prophets to various nations of the world, containing legislations suited to the particular temperament of each individual nation. Ismaili doctrine holds that a single universal religious truth lies at the root of the different religions. Some Jews accepted this model of religious pluralism, leading them to view Muhammad as a legitimate prophet, though not Jewish, sent to preach to the Arabs, just as the Hebrew prophets had been sent to deliver their messages to Israel; others refused this notion in entirety.

=== Bahya ben Joseph ibn Paquda ===

Bahye ben Yosef Ibn Paquda, of Zaragoza, was author of the first Jewish system of ethics &quot;Al Hidayah ila Faraid al-hulub&quot;, (&quot;Guide to the Duties of the Heart&quot;). Bahya often followed the method of the Arabian encyclopedists known as &quot;the Brethren of Purity&quot; but adopts some of Sufi tenets rather than Ismaili. According to Bahya, the Torah appeals to reason and knowledge as proofs of God&#x27;s existence. It is therefore a duty incumbent upon every one to make God an object of speculative reason and knowledge, in order to arrive at true faith. Baḥya borrows from Sufism and Jewish Kalam integrating them into Neoplatonism. Proof that Bahya borrowed from Sufism is underscored by the fact that the title of his eighth gate, &quot;Muḥasabat al-Nafs&quot; (&quot;Self-Examination&quot;), is reminiscent of the Sufi &quot;Abu Abd Allah Ḥarith Ibn-Asad&quot;, who has been surnamed &quot;El Muḥasib&quot; (&quot;the self-examiner&quot;), because—say his biographers—&quot;he was always immersed in introspection&quot;

=== Yehuda Ha-Levi and the Kuzari ===

Judah Halevi of Toledo, Spain defended Rabbinic Judaism against Islam, Christianity and Karaite Judaism. He was a student of Moses ibn Ezra whose education came from Isaac ibn Ghiyyat; trained as a Rationalist, he shed it in favor of Neoplatonism. Like al-Ghazali, Judah Halevi attempted to liberate religion from the bondage of philosophical systems. In particular, in a work written in Arabic &quot;Kitab al-Ḥujjah wal-Dalil fi Nuṣr al-Din al-Dhalil&quot;, translated by Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon, by the title &quot;Kuzari&quot; he elaborates upon his views of Judaism relative to other religions of the time.
=== Abraham ibn Daud ===
Abraham ibn Daud was a student of Rabbi Baruch ben Yitzhak Ibn Albalia, his maternal uncle. Ibn Daud&#x27;s philosophical work written in Arabic, &quot;Al-&#x27;akidah al-Rafiyah&quot; (&quot;The Sublime Faith&quot;), has been preserved in Hebrew by the title &quot;Emunah Ramah&quot;. Ibn Daud did not introduce a new philosophy, but he was the first to introduce a more thorough systematic form derived from Aristotle. Accordingly, Hasdai Crescas mentions Ibn Daud as the only Jewish philosopher among the predecessors of Maimonides. Overshadowed by Maimonides, ibn Daud&#x27;s &quot;Emunah Ramah&quot;, a work to which Maimonides was indebted, received little notice from later philosophers. &quot;True philosophy&quot;, according to Ibn Daud, &quot;does not entice us from religion; it tends rather to strengthen and solidify it. Moreover, it is the duty of every thinking Jew to become acquainted with the harmony existing between the fundamental doctrines of Judaism and those of philosophy, and, wherever they seem to contradict one another, to seek a mode of reconciling them&quot;.

== Maimonides ==

Maimonides wrote &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; — his most influential philosophic work. He was a student of his father, Rabbi Maimon ben Yosef (a student of Joseph ibn Migash) in Cordoba, Spain. When his family fled Spain, for Fez, Maimonides enrolled in the Academy of Fez and studied under Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan — a student of Isaac Alfasi. Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy and science with the teachings of Torah. In some ways his position was parallel to that of Averroes; in reaction to the attacks on Avicennian Aristotelism, Maimonides embraced and defended a stricter Aristotelism without Neoplatonic additions. The principles which inspired all of Maimonides&#x27; philosophical activity was identical those of Abraham Ibn Daud: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human intellect in science and philosophy. Maimonides departed from the teachings of Aristotle by suggesting that the world is not eternal, as Aristotle taught, but was created &quot;ex nihilo&quot;. In &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; (1:17 &amp; 2:11)&quot; Maimonides explains that Israel lost its Mesorah in exile, and with it &quot;we lost our science and philosophy — only to be rejuvenated in Al Andalus within the context of interaction and intellectual investigation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim texts.

== Medieval Jewish philosophy after Maimonides ==
Maimonides writings almost immediately came under attack from Karaites, Dominican Christians, Tosafists of Provence, Ashkenaz and Al Andalus. Scholars suggest that Maimonides instigated the Maimonidean Controversy when he verbally attacked Samuel ben Ali (&quot;Gaon of Baghdad&quot;) as &quot;one whom people accustom from his youth to believe that there is none like him in his generation,&quot; and he sharply attacked the &quot;monetary demands&quot; of the academies. Samuel ben Ali was an anti-Maimonidean operating in Babylon to undermine the works of Maimonides and those of Maimonides&#x27; patrons (the Al-Constantini family from North Africa). To illustrate the reach of the Maimonidean Controversy, Samuel ben Ali, the chief opponent of Maimonides in the East, was excommunicated by Daud Ibn Hodaya al Daudi (Exilarch of Mosul). Maimonides&#x27; attacks on Samuel ben Ali may not have been entirely altruistic given the position of Maimonides&#x27; in-laws in competing Yeshivas.

In Western Europe, the controversy was halted by the burning of Maimonides&#x27; works by Christian Dominicans in 1232. Avraham son of Rambam, continued fighting for his father&#x27;s beliefs in the East; desecration of Maimonides&#x27; tomb, at Tiberias by Jews, was a profound shock to Jews throughout the Diaspora and caused all to pause and reflect upon what was being done to the fabric of Jewish culture. This compelled many anti-Maimonideans to recant their assertions and realize what cooperation with Christians meant to them, their texts and their communities.

Maimonidean controversy flared up again at the beginning of the fourteenth century when Rabbi Shlomo ben Aderet, under influence from Asher ben Jehiel, issued a cherem on &quot;any member of the community who, being under twenty-five years, shall study the works of the Greeks on natural science and metaphysics.&quot;

Contemporary Kabbalists, Tosafists and Rationalists continue to engage in lively, sometimes caustic, debate in support of their positions and influence in the Jewish world. At the center of many of these debates are &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, &quot;13 Principles of Faith&quot;, &quot;Mishnah Torah&quot;, and his commentary on Anusim.

=== Yosef ben Yehuda of Ceuta ===
Joseph ben Judah of Ceuta was the son of Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan and a student of Maimonides for whom the &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; is written. Yosef traveled from Alexandria to Fustat to study logic, mathematics, and astronomy under Maimonides. Philosophically, Yosef&#x27;s dissertation, in Arabic, on the problem of &quot;Creation&quot; is suspected to have been written before contact with Maimonides. It is entitled &quot;Ma&#x27;amar bimehuyav ha-metsiut ve&#x27;eykhut sidur ha-devarim mimenu vehidush ha&#x27;olam&quot; (&quot;A Treatise as to (1) Necessary Existence (2) The Procedure of Things from the Necessary Existence and (3) The Creation of the World&quot;).

=== Jacob Anatoli ===
Jacob Anatoli is generally regarded as a pioneer in the application of the Maimonidean Rationalism to the study of Jewish texts. He was the son-in-law of Samuel ibn Tibbon, translator of Maimonides. Due to these family ties Anatoli was introduced to the philosophy of Maimonides, the study of which was such a great revelation to him that he, in later days, referred to it as the beginning of his intelligent and true comprehension of the Scriptures, while he frequently alluded to Ibn Tibbon as one of the two masters who had instructed and inspired him. Anatoli wrote the &quot;Malmad&quot; exhibiting his broad knowledge of classic Jewish exegetes, as well as Plato, Aristotle, Averroes, and the Vulgate, as well as with a large number of Christian institutions, some of which he ventures to criticize, such as celibacy and monastic castigation, as well as certain heretics and he repeatedly appeals to his readers for a broader cultivation of the classic languages and the non-Jewish branches of learning. To Anatoli, all men are formed in the image of God, although the Jews stand under a particular obligation to further the true cognition of God simply by reason of their election, &quot;the Greeks had chosen wisdom as their pursuit; the Romans, power; and the Jews, religiousness&quot;

=== Hillel ben Samuel ===
Firstly, Hillel ben Samuel&#x27;s importance in the history of medieval Jewish philosophy lies in his attempt to deal, systematically, with the question of the immortality of the soul. Secondly, Hillel played a major role in the controversies of 1289–90 concerning the philosophical works of Maimonides. Thirdly, Hillel was the first devotee of Jewish learning and Philosophy in Italy, bringing a close to a period of relative ignorance of Hakira in Verona (Italy). And finally, Hillel is one of the early Latin translators of &quot;the wise men of the nations&quot; (non-Jewish scholars).

Defending Maimonides, Hillel addressed a letter to his friend Maestro Gaio asking him to use his influence with the Jews of Rome against Maimonides&#x27; opponents (Solomon Petit). He also advanced the bold idea of gathering together Maimonides&#x27; defenders and opponents in Alexandria, in order to bring the controversy before a court of Babylonian rabbis, whose decision would be binding on both factions. Hillel was certain the verdict would favor Maimonides.

Hillel wrote a commentary on the 25 propositions appearing at the beginning of the second part of the Guide of the Perplexed, and three philosophical treatises, which were appended to Tagmulei ha-Nefesh: the first on knowledge and free will; the second on the question of why mortality resulted from the sin of Adam; the third on whether or not the belief in the fallen angels is a true belief.

=== Shemtob Ben Joseph Ibn Falaquera ===

Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera was a Spanish-born philosopher who pursued reconciliation between Jewish dogma and philosophy. Scholars speculate he was a student of Rabbi David Kimhi whose family fled Spain to Narbonne. Ibn Falaquera lived an ascetic live of solitude. Ibn Falaquera&#x27;s two leading philosophic authorities were Averroes and Maimonides. Ibn Falaquera defended the &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; against attacks of anti-Maimonideans. He knew the works of the Islamic philosophers better than any Jewish scholar of his time, and made many of them available to other Jewish scholars – often without attribution (&quot;Reshit Hokhmah&quot;). Ibn Falaquera did not hesitate to modify Islamic philosophic texts when it suited his purposes. For example, Ibn Falaquera turned Alfarabi&#x27;s account of the origin of philosophic religion into a discussion of the origin of the &quot;virtuous city&quot;. Ibn Falaquera&#x27;s other works include, but are not limited to Iggeret Hanhagat ha-Guf we ha-Nefesh, a treatise in verse on the control of the body and the soul.

* &quot;Iggeret ha-Wikkuaḥ&quot;, a dialogue between a religious Jew and a Jewish philosopher on the harmony of philosophy and religion.
* &quot;Reshit Ḥokmah&quot;, treating of moral duties, of the sciences, and of the necessity of studying philosophy.
* &quot;Sefer ha-Ma&#x27;alot&quot;, on different degrees of human perfection.
* &quot;Moreh ha-Moreh&quot;, commentary on the philosophical part of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;.

=== Joseph ben Abba Mari ibn Kaspi ===
Ibn Kaspi was a fierce advocate of Maimonides to such an extent that he left for Egypt in 1314 in order to hear explanations on the Guide of the Perplexed from Maimonides&#x27; grandchildren. When he heard that the Guide of the Perplexed was being studied in the Muslim philosophical schools of Fez, he left for that town (in 1332) in order to observe their method of study.

Ibn Kaspi began writing when he was 17 years old on topics which included logic, linguistics, ethics, theology, biblical exegesis, and super-commentaries to Abraham Ibn Ezra and Maimonides. Philosophic systems he followed were Aristotle&#x27;s and Averroes&#x27;. He defines his aim as &quot;not to be a fool who believes in everything, but only in that which can be verified by proof...and not to be of the second unthinking category which disbelieves from the start of its inquiry,&quot; since &quot;certain things must be accepted by tradition, because they cannot be proven.&quot; Scholars continue to debate whether ibn Kaspi was a heretic or one of Judaisms most illustrious scholars.

=== Gersonides ===

Rabbi Levi ben Gershon was a student of his father Gerson ben Solomon of Arles, who in turn was a student of Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera. Gersonides is best known for his work &quot;Milhamot HaShem&quot; (&quot;Wars of the Lord&quot;). &quot;Milhamot HaShem&quot; is modelled after the &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;. Gersonides and his father were avid students of the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias, Aristotle, Empedocles, Galen, Hippocrates, Homer, Plato, Ptolemy, Pythagoras, Themistius, Theophrastus, Ali ibn Abbas al-Magusi, Ali ibn Ridwan, Averroes, Avicenna, Qusta ibn Luqa, Al-Farabi, Al-Fergani, Chonain, Isaac Israeli, Ibn Tufail, Ibn Zuhr, Isaac Alfasi, and Maimonides. Gersonides held that God does not have complete foreknowledge of human acts. &quot;Gersonides, bothered by the old question of how God&#x27;s foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom, suggests that what God knows beforehand is all the choices open to each individual. God does not know, however, which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make.&quot;

=== Moses Narboni ===
Moses ben Joshua composed commentaries on Islamic philosophical works. As an admirer of Averroes, he devoted a great deal of study to his works and wrote commentaries on a number of them. His best-known work is his &quot;Shelemut ha-Nefesh&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Perfection of the Soul&quot;). Moses began studying philosophy with his father when he was thirteen, later studying with Moses ben David Caslari and Abraham ben David Caslari - both of whom were students of Kalonymus ben Kalonymus. Moses believed that Judaism was a guide to the highest degree of theoretical and moral truth. He believed that the Torah had both a simple, direct meaning accessible to the average reader as well as a deeper, metaphysical meaning accessible to thinkers. Moses rejected the belief in miracles, instead believing they could be explained, and defended man&#x27;s free will by philosophical arguments.

=== Isaac ben Sheshet Perfet ===
Isaac ben Sheshet Perfet, of Barcelona, studied under Hasdai Crescas and Rabbi Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi. Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi was a steadfast Rationalist who did not hesitate to refute leading authorities, such as Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, Moses ben Nahman, and Solomon ben Adret. The pogroms of 1391, against Jews of Spain, forced Isaac to flee to Algiers - where he lived out his life. Isaac&#x27;s responsa evidence a profound knowledge of the philosophical writings of his time; in one of Responsa No. 118 he explains the difference between the opinion of &quot;Gersonides&quot; and that of &quot;Abraham ben David of Posquières&quot; on free will, and gives his own views on the subject. He was an adversary of Kabbalah who never spoke of the Sefirot; he quotes another philosopher when reproaching kabbalists with &quot;&quot;believing in the &quot;Ten&quot; (Sefirot) as the Christians believe in the Trinity&quot;&quot;.

=== Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas ===

Hasdai Crescas, of Barcelona, was a leading rationalist on issues of natural law and free-will. His views can be seen as precursors to Baruch Spinoza&#x27;s. His work, &quot;Or Adonai&quot;, became a classic refutation of medieval Aristotelianism, and harbinger of the scientific revolution in the 16th century. Hasdai Crescas was a student of Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi, who in turn was a student of Reuben ben Nissim Gerondi. Crescas was a rabbi and the head of the Jewish community of Aragon, and in some ways of all Hispanic Jewry, during one of its most critical periods. Among his fellow students and friends, his best friend was Isaac ben Sheshet Perfet. Crescas&#x27; students won accolades as participants in the Disputation of Tortosa.

=== Simeon ben Zemah Duran ===
Influenced by the teaching of Rabbi Nissim of Gerona, via Ephraim Vidal&#x27;s Yeshiva in Majorca, Duran&#x27;s commentary &quot;Magen Avot&quot; (&quot;The Shield of the Fathers&quot;), which influenced Joseph Albo, is important. He was also a student of philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and especially of medicine, which he practiced for a number of years at Palma, in Majorca. &quot;Magen Avot&quot; deals with concepts such as the nature of God, the eternity of the Torah, the coming of the Messiah, and the Resurrection of the dead. Duran believed that Judaism has three dogmas only: the existence of God, the Torah&#x27;s Divine origin, and Reward and Punishment; in this regard he was followed by Joseph Albo.

=== Joseph Albo ===
Joseph Albo, of Monreal, was a student of Hasdai Crescas. He wrote &quot;Sefer ha-Ikkarim&quot; (&quot;Book of Principles&quot;), a classic work on the fundamentals of Judaism. Albo narrows the fundamental Jewish principles of faith from thirteen to three -
::::::* belief in the existence of God,
::::::* belief in revelation, and
::::::* belief in divine justice, as related to the idea of immortality.
Albo rejects the assumption that creation ex nihilo is essential in belief in God. Albo freely criticizes Maimonides&#x27; thirteen principles of belief and Crescas&#x27; six principles. According to Albo, &quot;belief in the Messiah is only a &#x27;twig&#x27; unnecessary to the soundness of the trunk&quot;; not essential to Judaism. Nor is it true, according to Albo, that every law is binding. Although every ordinance has the power of conferring happiness in its observance, it is not true that every law must be observed, or that through the neglect of a part of the law, a Jew would violate the divine covenant or be damned. Contemporary Orthodox Jews, however, vehemently disagree with Albo&#x27;s position believing that all Jews are divinely obligated to fulfill every applicable commandment.

=== Hoter ben Solomon ===

Hoter ben Shlomo was a scholar and philosopher in Yemen heavily influenced by Nethanel ben al-Fayyumi, Maimonides, Saadia Gaon and al-Ghazali. The connection between the &quot;Epistle of the Brethren of Purity&quot; and Ismailism suggests the adoption of this work as one of the main sources of what would become known as &quot;Jewish Ismailism&quot; as found in Late Medieval Yemenite Judaism. &quot;Jewish Ismailism&quot; consisted of adapting, to Judaism, a few Ismaili doctrines about cosmology, prophecy, and hermeneutics. There are many examples of the Brethren of Purity influencing Yemenite Jewish philosophers and authors in the period 1150–1550. Some traces of Brethren of Purity doctrines, as well as of their numerology, are found in two Yemenite philosophical midrashim written in 1420–1430: &quot;Midrash ha-hefez&quot; (&quot;Midrash of Desire&quot;) by Zechariah ha-Rofé (a.k.a. Yahya al-Tabib) and the &quot;Siraj al-&#x27;uqul&quot; (&quot;Lamp of Intellects&quot;) by Hoter ben Solomon.

=== Don Isaac Abravanel ===
Isaac Abravanel, statesman, philosopher, Bible commentator, and financier who commented on Maimonides&#x27; thirteen principles in his &quot;Rosh Amanah&quot;. Isaac Abravanel was steeped in Rationalism by the Ibn Yahya family, who had a residence immediately adjacent to the &quot;Great Synagogue of Lisbon&quot; (also built by the Ibn Yahya Family). His most important work, &quot;Rosh Amanah&quot; (&quot;The Pinnacle of Faith&quot;), defends Maimonides&#x27; thirteen articles of belief against attacks of Hasdai Crescas and Yosef Albo. &quot;Rosh Amanah&quot; ends with the statement that &quot;Maimonides compiled these articles merely in accordance with the fashion of other nations, which set up axioms or fundamental principles for their science&quot;.

Isaac Abravanel was born and raised in Lisbon; a student of the Rabbi of Lisbon, &quot;Yosef ben Shlomo Ibn Yahya&quot;. Rabbi Yosef was a poet, religious scholar, rebuilder of &quot;Ibn Yahya Synagogue of Calatayud&quot;, well versed in rabbinic literature and in the learning of his time, devoting his early years to the study of Jewish philosophy. The Ibn Yahya family were renowned physicians, philosophers and accomplished aides to the Portuguese Monarchy for centuries.

Isaac&#x27;s grandfather, Samuel Abravanel, was forcibly converted to Christianity during the pogroms of 1391 and took the Spanish name &quot;Juan Sanchez de Sevilla&quot;. Samuel fled Castile-León, Spain, in 1397 for Lisbon, Portugal, and reverted to Judaism - shedding his &quot;Converso&quot; after living among Christians for six years. Conversions outside Judaism, coerced or otherwise, had a strong impact upon young Isaac, later compelling him to forfeit his immense wealth in an attempt to redeem Iberian Jewry from coercion of the Alhambra Decree. There are parallels between what he writes, and documents produced by Inquisitors, that present conversos as ambivalent to Christianity and sometimes even ironic in their expressions regarding their new religion - crypto-jews.

=== Leone Ebreo ===
Judah Leon Abravanel was a Portuguese physician, poet and philosopher. His work &quot;Dialoghi d&#x27;amore&quot; (&quot;Dialogues of Love&quot;), written in Italian, was one of the most important philosophical works of his time. In an attempt to circumvent a plot hatched by local Catholic Bishops to kidnap his son, Judah sent his son from Castile to Portugal with a nurse, but by order of the king the son was seized and baptized. This was a devastating insult to Judah and his family, and was a source of bitterness throughout Judah&#x27;s life and the topic of his writings years later; especially since this was not the first time the Abravanel Family was subjected to such embarrassment at the hands of the Catholic Church.

Judah&#x27;s &quot;Dialoghi&quot; is regarded as the finest of Humanistic Period works. His neoplatonism is derived from the Hispanic Jewish community, especially the works of Ibn Gabirol. Platonic notions of reaching towards a nearly impossible ideal of beauty, wisdom, and perfection encompass the whole of his work. In &quot;Dialoghi d&#x27;amore&quot;, Judah defines love in philosophical terms. He structures his three dialogues as a conversation between two abstract &quot;characters&quot;: Philo, representing love or appetite, and Sophia, representing science or wisdom, Philo+Sophia (philosophia).

=== Criticisms of Kabbalah ===
The word &quot;Kabbalah&quot; was used in medieval Jewish texts to mean &quot;tradition&quot;, see Abraham Ibn Daud&#x27;s &quot;Sefer Ha-Qabbalah&quot; also known as the &quot;Book of our Tradition&quot;. &quot;Book of our Tradition&quot; does not refer to mysticism of any kind - it chronicles &quot;our tradition of scholarship and study&quot; in two Babylonian Academies, through the Geonim, into Talmudic Yeshivas of Spain. In Talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in Judaism, known as &quot;Maaseh Bereshith&quot; (the work of creation) and &quot;Maaseh Merkavah&quot; (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these texts as referring to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of Torah.

In the 13th century, however, a mystical-esoteric system emerged which became known as &quot;the Kabbalah&quot;. Many of the beliefs associated with Kabbalah had long been rejected by philosophers. Saadia Gaon had taught in his book &quot;Emunot v&#x27;Deot&quot; that Jews who believe in &quot;gilgul&quot; have adopted a non-Jewish belief. Maimonides rejected many texts of &quot;Heichalot&quot;, particularly &quot;Shi&#x27;ur Qomah&quot; whose anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical.

In the 13th century, Meir ben Simon of Narbonne wrote an epistle (included in &quot;Milhhemet Mitzvah&quot;) against early Kabbalists, singled out &quot;Sefer Bahir&quot;, rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the tanna R. Nehhunya ben ha-Kanah and describing some of its content:

== Renaissance Jewish philosophy and philosophers ==

Some of the Monarchies of Asia Minor and European welcomed expelled Jewish Merchants, scholars and theologians. Divergent Jewish philosophies evolved against the backdrop of new cultures, new languages and renewed theological exchange. Philosophic exploration continued through the Renaissance period as the center-of-mass of Jewish Scholarship shifted to France, Germany, Italy, and Turkey.

=== Elias ben Moise del Medigo ===
Elia del Medigo was a descendant of &quot;Judah ben Eliezer ha-Levi Minz&quot; and &quot;Moses ben Isaac ha-Levi Minz&quot;. Eli&#x27;ezer del Medigo, of Rome, received the surname &quot;Del Medigo&quot; after studying medicine. The name was later changed from &quot;Del Medigo&quot; to &quot;Ha-rofeh&quot;. He was the father and teacher of a long line of rationalist philosophers and scholars. Non-Jewish students of Delmedigo classified him as an &quot;Averroist&quot;, however, he saw himself as a follower of Maimonides. Scholastic association of Maimonides and Ibn Rushd would have been a natural one; Maimonides, towards the end of his life, was impressed with the Ibn Rushd commentaries and recommended them to his students. The followers of Maimonides (Maimonideans) had therefore been, for several generations before Delmedigo, the leading users, translators and disseminators of the works of Ibn Rushd in Jewish circles, and advocates for Ibn Rushd even after Islamic rejection of his radical views. Maimonideans regarded Maimonides and Ibn Rushd as following the same general line. In his book, Delmedigo portrays himself as defender of Maimonidean Judaism, and — like many Maimonideans — he emphasized the rationality of Jewish tradition.
=== Moses Almosnino ===
Moses Almosnino was born Thessaloniki 1515 - died Constantinople abt 1580. He was a student of Levi Ibn Habib, who was in turn a student of Jacob ibn Habib, who was, in turn, a student of Nissim ben Reuben. In 1570 he wrote a commentary on the Pentateuch titled &quot;&quot;Yede Mosheh&quot; (The Hands of Moses); also an exposition of the Talmudical treatise &quot;Abot&quot; (Ethics of the Fathers), published in Salonica in 1563; and a collection of sermons delivered upon various occasions, particularly funeral orations, entitled &quot;Meammeẓ Koaḥ&quot;&quot; (Re-enforcing Strength).

al-Ghazâlî&#x27;s &quot;Intentions of the Philosophers&quot; (&quot;De&#x27;ôt ha-Fîlôsôfîm or Kavvanôt ha-Fîlôsôfîm&quot;) was one of the most widespread philosophical texts studied among Jews in Europe having been translated in 1292 by Isaac Albalag. Later Hebrew commentators include Moses Narboni, and Moses Almosnino.

=== Moses ben Jehiel Ha-Kohen Porto-Rafa (Rapaport) ===
Moses ben Jehiel Ha-Kohen Porto-Rafa (Rapaport), was a member of the German family &quot;Rafa&quot; (from whom the Delmedigo family originates) that settled in the town of Porto in the vicinity of Verona, Italy, and became the progenitors of the renowned Rapaport rabbinic family. In 1602 Moses served as rabbi of Badia Polesine in Piedmont. Moses was a friend of Leon Modena.

=== Abraham ben Judah ha-Levi Minz ===
Abraham ben Judah ha-Levi Minz was an Italian rabbi who flourished at Padua in the first half of the 16th century, father-in-law of Meïr Katzenellenbogen. Minz studied chiefly under his father, Judah Minz, whom he succeeded as rabbi and head of the yeshiva of Padua.

=== Meir ben Isaac Katzellenbogen ===
Meir ben Isaac Katzellenbogen was born in Prague where together with Shalom Shachna he studied under Jacob Pollak. Many rabbis, including Moses Isserles, addressed him in their responsa as the &quot;av bet din of the republic of Venice.&quot; The great scholars of the Renaissance with whom he corresponded include &quot;Shmuel ben Moshe di Modena&quot;, &quot;Joseph Katz&quot;, &quot;Solomon Luria&quot;, &quot;Moses Isserles&quot;, &quot;Obadiah Sforno&quot;, and &quot;Moses Alashkar&quot;.
=== Elijah Ba&#x27;al Shem of Chelm ===
Rabbi Elijah Ba&#x27;al Shem of Chelm was a student of Rabbi Solomon Luria who was, in turn a student of Rabbi Shalom Shachna - father-in-law and teacher of Moses Isserles. Elijah Ba&#x27;al Shem of Chelm was also a cousin of Moses Isserles.

=== Eliezer ben Elijah Ashkenazi ===
Rabbi Eliezer ben Elijah Ashkenazi Ha-rofeh Ashkenazi of Nicosia (&quot;the physician&quot;) the author of &quot;Yosif Lekah&quot; on the Book of Esther.

=== Other notable Renaissance Jewish philosophers ===
* Francisco Sanches
* Miguel de Barrios
* Uriel da Costa

== Seventeenth-century Jewish philosophy ==
With expulsion from Spain came the dissemination of Jewish philosophical investigation throughout the Mediterranean Basin, Northern Europe and the Western Hemisphere. The center-of-mass of Rationalism shifted to France, Italy, Germany, Crete, Sicily and Netherlands. Expulsion from Spain and the coordinated pogroms of Europe resulted in the cross-pollination of variations on Rationalism incubated within diverse communities. This period is also marked by the intellectual exchange among leaders of the Christian Reformation and Jewish scholars. Of particular note is the line of Rationalists who migrated out of Germany, and present-day Italy into Crete, and other areas of the Ottoman Empire seeking safety and protection from the endless pogroms fomented by the House of Habsburg and the Roman Catholic Church against Jews.

Rationalism was incubating in places far from Spain. From stories told by Rabbi Elijah Ba&#x27;al Shem of Chelm, German-speaking Jews, descendants of Jews who migrated back to Jerusalem after Charlemagne&#x27;s invitation was revoked in Germany many centuries earlier, who lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century, were influenced by prevailing Mutazilite scholars of Jerusalem. A German-speaking Palestinian Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed &quot;Dolberger&quot;. When the knights of the First Crusade came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger&#x27;s family members rescued German-speaking Jews in Palestine and brought them back to the safety of Worms, Germany, to repay the favor. Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the eleventh century.

All of the foregoing resulted in an explosion of new ideas and philosophic paths.

=== Yosef Shlomo ben Eliyahu Dal Medigo ===
Joseph Solomon Delmedigo was a physician and teacher – Baruch Spinoza was a student of his works.

=== Baruch Spinoza ===

Baruch Spinoza founded Spinozism, broke with Rabbinic Jewish tradition, and was placed in &quot;herem&quot; by the Beit Din of Amsterdam. The influence in his work from Maimonides and Leone Ebreo is evident. Elia del Medigo claims to be a student of the works of Spinoza. Some contemporary critics (e.g., Wachter, &quot;Der Spinozismus im Judenthum&quot;) claimed to detect the influence of the Kabbalah, while others (e.g., Leibniz) regarded Spinozism as a revival of Averroism – a talmudist manner of referencing to Maimonidean Rationalism. In the centuries that have lapsed since the &quot;herem&quot; declaration, scholars have re-examined the works of Spinoza and find them to reflect a body of work and thinking that is not unlike some contemporary streams of Judaism. For instance, while Spinoza was accused of pantheism, scholars have come to view his work as advocating panentheism, a valid contemporary view easily accommodated by contemporary Judaism.

=== Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi ===
Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi was a student of his father, but most notably also a student of his grandfather Rabbi Elijah Ba&#x27;al Shem of Chelm.

=== Jacob Emden ===
Rabbi Jacob Emden was a student of his father Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi a rabbi in Amsterdam. Emden, a steadfast Talmudist, was a prominent opponent of the Sabbateans (Messianic Kabbalists who followed Sabbatai Tzvi). Although anti-Maimonidean, Emden should be noted for his critical examination of the Zohar concluding that large parts of it were forged.

=== Other seventeenth-century Jewish philosophers ===
* Jacob Abendana Sephardic Rabbi and Philosopher.
* Isaac Cardoso.
* David Nieto Sephardic Rabbi and Philosopher.
* Isaac Orobio de Castro Sephardic Rabbi and Philosopher.

=== Philosophical criticisms of Kabbalah ===

Rabbi Leone di Modena wrote that if we were to accept the Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would indeed be compatible with Judaism, as the Trinity closely resembles the Kabbalistic doctrine of the Sefirot.

== Eighteenth and nineteenth-century Jewish philosophy ==
A new era began in the 18th century with the thought of Moses Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn has been described as the &quot;&#x27;third Moses,&#x27; with whom begins a new era in Judaism,&quot; just as new eras began with Moses the prophet and with Moses Maimonides. Mendelssohn was a German Jewish philosopher to whose ideas the renaissance of European Jews, Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment) is indebted. He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism, although Reform spokesmen have been &quot;resistant to claim him as their spiritual father&quot;. Mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both Germans and Jews. His most significant book was &quot;Jerusalem oder über religiöse Macht und Judentum&quot; (&quot;Jerusalem&quot;), first published in 1783.

Alongside Mendelssohn, other important Jewish philosophers of the eighteenth century included:
* Menachem Mendel Lefin, anti-Hasidic Haskalah philosopher.
* Salomon Maimon, Enlightenment philosopher.
* Isaac Satanow, a Haskalah philosopher.
* Naphtali Ullman, Haskalah philosopher.

Important Jewish philosophers of the nineteenth century included:
* Elijah Benamozegh, a Sephardic rabbi and philosopher.
* Hermann Cohen, a neo-Kantian Jewish philosopher.
* Moses Hess, a secular Jewish philosopher and one of the founders of socialism.
* Samson Raphael Hirsch, leader of the Torah im Derech Eretz school of 19th century neo-Orthodoxy.
* Samuel Hirsch, a leader of Reform Judaism.
* Nachman Krochmal, Haskalah philosopher in Galicia.
* Samuel David Luzzatto a Sephardic rabbi and philosopher.
* Karl Marx, German economist and Jewish philosopher.

=== Traditionalist attitudes towards philosophy ===

Haredi traditionalists who emerged in reaction to the Haskalah considered the fusion of religion and philosophy as difficult because classical philosophers start with no preconditions for which conclusions they must reach in their investigation, while classical religious believers have a set of religious principles of faith that they hold one must believe. Most Haredim contended that one cannot simultaneously be a philosopher and a true adherent of a revealed religion. In this view, all attempts at synthesis ultimately fail. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, for example, viewed all philosophy as untrue and heretical. In this he represents one strand of Hasidic thought, with creative emphasis on the emotions.

Other exponents of Hasidism had a more positive attitude towards philosophy. In the Chabad writings of Schneur Zalman of Liadi, Hasidut is seen as able to unite all parts of Torah thought, from the schools of philosophy to mysticism, by uncovering the illuminating Divine essence that permeates and transcends all approaches. Interpreting the verse from Job, &quot;from my flesh I see HaShem&quot;, Shneur Zalman explained the inner meaning, or &quot;soul&quot;, of the Jewish mystical tradition in intellectual form, by means of analogies drawn from the human realm. As explained and continued by the later leaders of Chabad, this enabled the human mind to grasp concepts of Godliness, and so enable the heart to feel the love and awe of God, emphasised by all the founders of hasidism, in an internal way. This development, the culminating level of the Jewish mystical tradition, in this way bridges philosophy and mysticism, by expressing the transcendent in human terms.

== 20th and 21st-century Jewish philosophy ==
=== Jewish existentialism ===

A major trend in the timeline of modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism based on existentialism. Among the early Jewish existentialist philosophers was Lev Shestov (born Jehuda Leib Schwarzmann), a Russian-Jewish philosopher. Another of the most influential Jewish existentialists in the first half of the 20th century was Franz Rosenzweig. While researching his doctoral dissertation on the 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Rosenzweig reacted against Hegel&#x27;s idealism and developed an existential approach. For a time, Rosenzweig considered conversion to Christianity, but in 1913, he turned to Jewish philosophy. He became a philosopher and student of Hermann Cohen. Rosenzweig&#x27;s major work, &quot;Star of Redemption&quot;, expounded his philosophy, portraying the relationships between God, humanity, and the world as they are connected by creation, revelation, and redemption. Orthodox rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, and Conservative rabbis Neil Gillman and Elliot N. Dorff, have also been described as existentialists.

French philosopher and Talmudic commentator Emmanuel Levinas, whose approach grew out of the phenomenological tradition in philosophy, has also been described as a Jewish existentialist.

=== Jewish rationalism ===

Rationalism re-emerged as a popular perspective among Jews. Contemporary Jewish rationalism often draws on ideas associated with medieval philosophers such as Maimonides and modern Jewish rationalists such as Hermann Cohen.

Cohen was a German Jewish neo-Kantian philosopher who turned to Jewish subjects at the end of his career in the early 20th century, picking up on the ideas of Maimonides. In America, Steven Schwarzschild continued Cohen&#x27;s legacy. Another prominent contemporary Jewish rationalist is Lenn Goodman, who works out of the traditions of medieval Jewish rationalist philosophy. Conservative rabbis Alan Mittleman of the Jewish Theological Seminary and Elliot N. Dorff of American Jewish University also see themselves in the rationalist tradition, as does David Novak of the University of Toronto. Novak works in the natural law tradition, which is one version of rationalism.

Philosophers in Israel in the rationalist tradition included David Hartman and Moshe Halbertal.
Some Orthodox rationalists in Israel take a &quot;restorationist&quot; approach, reaching back in time for tools to simplify Rabbinic Judaism and bring all Jews, regardless of status or stream of Judaism, closer to the observance of &quot;Halakha&quot;, &quot;mitzvot&quot;, &quot;kashrut&quot;, and Maimonides&#x27; Jewish principles of faith. Dor Daim and Rambamists are two groups who reject mysticism as a &quot;superstitious innovation&quot; to an otherwise clear and succinct set of laws and rules. According to them, shame and disgrace are attached to failure to investigate matters of religious principle using the fullest powers of human reason and intellect. One cannot be considered wise or perceptive if one does not attempt to understand the origins and establish the correctness of one&#x27;s beliefs.

=== Holocaust theology ===

Judaism traditionally holds that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. These attributes raise complex questions about the existence of evil in the world. A significant challenge for monotheistic faiths is reconciling the existence of positive divine characteristics with the reality of evil. Key questions include the relationship between good and bad and the interplay between God and the concept of a devil. This is known as the problem of evil. Various theodicies have been proposed across monotheistic religions to address this issue. The scale of suffering observed during events such as the Holocaust has led many to re-examine classical theological perspectives. As a result, there is a discussion surrounding Jewish philosophies related to faith in the aftermath of the Holocaust, which is addressed in the field of Holocaust theology.

=== Reconstructionist theology ===

Perhaps the most controversial form of Jewish philosophy that developed in the early 20th century was the religious naturalism of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, whose theology was a variant of John Dewey&#x27;s pragmatist philosophy. Kaplan’s naturalism combined nontheist metaphysics with religious terminology to construct a philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional Judaism. In agreement with the classical, medieval Jewish thinkers, Kaplan affirmed that God is an impersonal being (if a &quot;being&quot; at all) and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of God are, at best, imperfect metaphors. Kaplan&#x27;s theology went beyond this to claim that God is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled, writing that &quot;to believe in God means to take for granted that it is man&#x27;s destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society.&quot;

=== Process theology ===
A recent trend has been to reframe Jewish theology through the lens of process philosophy—more specifically, process theology. Process philosophy suggests that fundamental elements of the universe are occasions of experience. According to this notion, what individuals consider concrete &quot;objects&quot; are successions of &quot;occasions&quot; of experience. Occasions of experience can be collected into groupings; something complex, such as a human being, is thus a grouping of many smaller occasions of experience. In this view, everything in the universe is characterized by experience (not to be confused with consciousness); this system has no mind-body duality because the &quot;mind&quot; is seen as a very developed kind of experiencing entity.

Intrinsic to this worldview is the notion that prior experiences influence all experiences and will influence all future experiences. This process of influencing is never deterministic; an occasion of experience consists of comprehending other experiences and then reacting to them. This is the &quot;process&quot; in &quot;process philosophy&quot;. Process philosophy gives God a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them; thus, process philosophy is a form of panentheism.

The original ideas of process theology were developed by Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000) and influenced a number of Jewish theologians, including British philosopher Samuel Alexander (1859–1938), and Rabbis Max Kadushin, Milton Steinberg, Levi A. Olan, Harry Slominsky, and Bradley Shavit Artson. Abraham Joshua Heschel has also been linked to this tradition.

=== Kabbalah and philosophy ===
Kabbalah continued to be central to Haredi Judaism, which generally rejected philosophy; the Chabad strain of Hasidic Judaism showed a more positive attitude towards philosophy. Meanwhile, non-Orthodox Jewish thought in the latter 20th century saw resurgent interest in Kabbalah. In academic studies, Gershom Scholem began the critical investigation of Jewish mysticism, while in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations, Jewish Renewal and Neo-Hasidism spiritualised worship. Many philosophers do not consider this a form of philosophy, as Kabbalah is a collection of esoteric methods of textual interpretation. Mysticism is generally understood as an alternative to philosophy, not a variant of philosophy.

Among the modern critics of Kabbalah was Yihhyah Qafahh, who wrote a book entitled &quot;Milhamoth ha-Shem&quot; (Wars of the Name) against what he perceived as the false teachings of the Zohar and the Kabbalah of Isaac Luria. He is credited with spearheading the Dor Daim. Yeshayahu Leibowitz publicly shared the views expressed in Rabbi Yihhyah Qafahh&#x27;s book &quot;Milhhamoth ha-Shem&quot; and elaborated upon these views in his many writings.

<text>White is a racial classification of people generally used for those of predominantly European ancestry. It is also a skin color specifier, although the definition can vary depending on context, nationality, ethnicity and point of view.

Description of populations as &quot;White&quot; in reference to their skin color is occasionally found in Greco-Roman ethnography and other ancient or medieval sources, but these societies did not have any notion of a White race or pan-European identity. The term &quot;White race&quot; or &quot;White people&quot;, defined by their light skin among other physical characteristics, entered the major European languages in the later seventeenth century, when the concept of a &quot;unified White&quot; achieved greater acceptance in Europe, in the context of racialized slavery and social status in the European colonies. Scholarship on race distinguishes the modern concept from pre-modern descriptions, which focused on physical complexion rather than the idea of race. Prior to the modern era, no European peoples regarded themselves as &quot;White&quot;; instead they defined their identity in terms of their religion, ancestry, ethnicity, or nationality.

Contemporary anthropologists and other scientists, while recognizing the reality of biological variation between different human populations, regard the concept of a unified, distinguishable &quot;White race&quot; as a social construct with no scientific basis.

== Physical descriptions in antiquity ==

According to anthropologist Nina Jablonski:
The Ancient Egyptian (New Kingdom) funerary text known as the &quot;Book of Gates&quot; distinguishes &quot;four groups&quot; in a procession. These are the Egyptians, the Levantine and Canaanite peoples or &quot;Asiatics&quot;, the &quot;Nubians&quot; and the &quot;fair-skinned Libyans&quot;. The Egyptians are depicted as considerably darker-skinned than the Levantines (persons from what is now Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and Jordan) and Libyans, but considerably lighter than the Nubians (modern Sudan).

The assignment of positive and negative connotations of &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Black&quot; to certain persons date to the very old age in a number of Indo-European languages, but these differences were not necessarily used in respect to skin colors. Religious conversion was sometimes described figuratively as a change in skin color. Similarly, the &quot;Rigveda&quot; uses &quot;black skin&quot; as a metaphor for irreligiosity. Ancient Egyptians, Mycenaean Greeks and Minoans generally depicted women as having pale or white skin while men were depicted as dark brown or tanned. As a result, men with pale or light skin, &quot;leukochrōs&quot; (λευκόχρως, &quot;white-skinned&quot;) could be considered weak and effeminate by Ancient Greek writers such as Plato and Aristotle. According to Aristotle &quot;Those whose skin is too dark are cowardly: witness Egyptians and the Ethiopians. Those whose skin is too light are equally cowardly: witness women. The skin color typical of the courageous should be halfway between the two.&quot; Similarly, Xenophon of Athens describes Persian prisoners of war as &quot;white-skinned because they were never without their clothing, and soft and unused to toil because they always rode in carriages&quot; and states that Greek soldiers as a result believed &quot;that the war would be in no way different from having to fight with women.&quot;

Classicist James H. Dee states &quot;the Greeks do not describe themselves as &#x27;White people&#x27;or as anything else because they had &quot;no&quot; regular word in their color vocabulary for themselves.&quot; People&#x27;s skin color did not carry useful meaning; what mattered is where they lived. Herodotus described the Scythian Budini as having deep blue eyes and bright red hair and the Egyptians – quite like the Colchians – as (, &quot;dark-skinned&quot;) and curly-haired. He also gives the possibly first reference to the common Greek name of the tribes living south of Egypt, otherwise known as Nubians, which was (, &quot;burned-faced&quot;). Later Xenophanes of Colophon described the Aethiopians as black and the Thracians as having red hair and blue eyes. In his description of the Scythians, Hippocrates states that the cold weather &quot;burns their white skin and turns it ruddy.&quot;

== Modern racial hierarchies ==

The term &quot;White race&quot; or &quot;White people&quot; entered the major European languages in the later seventeenth century, originating with the racialization of slavery at the time, in the context of the Atlantic slave trade and the enslavement of indigenous peoples in the Spanish Empire. It has repeatedly been ascribed to strains of blood, ancestry, and physical traits, and was eventually made into a subject of pseudoscientific research, which culminated in scientific racism, which was later widely repudiated by the scientific community. According to historian Irene Silverblatt, &quot;Race thinking… made social categories into racial truths.&quot; Bruce David Baum, citing the work of Ruth Frankenberg, states, &quot;the history of modern racist domination has been bound up with the history of how European peoples defined themselves (and sometimes some other peoples) as members of a superior &#x27;white race&#x27;.&quot; Alastair Bonnett argues that &quot;white identity&quot;, as it is presently conceived, is an American project, reflecting American interpretations of race and history.

According to Gregory Jay, a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee:
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, &quot;East Asian peoples were almost uniformly described as White, never as yellow.&quot; Michael Keevak&#x27;s history &quot;Becoming Yellow&quot;, finds that East Asians were redesignated as being yellow-skinned because &quot;yellow had become a &quot;racial&quot; designation,&quot; and that the replacement of White with yellow as a description came through pseudoscientific discourse.

=== A social category formed by colonialism ===

A three-part racial scheme in color terms was used in seventeenth-century Latin America under Spanish rule. Irene Silverblatt traces &quot;race thinking&quot; in South America to the social categories of colonialism and state formation: &quot;White, black, and brown are abridged, abstracted versions of colonizer, slave, and colonized.&quot; By the mid-seventeenth century, the novel term (&quot;Spaniard&quot;) was being equated in written documents with , or &quot;White&quot;. In Spain&#x27;s American colonies, Black African, Indigenous (), Jewish, or morisco ancestry formally excluded individuals from the &quot;purity of blood&quot; () requirements for holding any public office under the Royal Pragmatic of 1501. Similar restrictions applied in the military, some religious orders, colleges, and universities, leading to a nearly all-White priesthood and professional stratum. Blacks and were subject to tribute obligations and forbidden to bear arms, and black and women were forbidden to wear jewels, silk, or precious metals in early colonial Mexico and Peru. Those (people with dark skin) and (people of mixed African and European ancestry) with resources largely sought to evade these restrictions by passing as White. A brief royal offer to buy the privileges of Whiteness for a substantial sum of money attracted fifteen applicants before pressure from White elites ended the practice.

In the British colonies in North America and the Caribbean, the designation &quot;English&quot; or &quot;Christian&quot; was initially used in contrast to Native Americans or Africans. Early appearances of White race or White people in the Oxford English Dictionary begin in the seventeenth century. Historian Winthrop Jordan reports that, &quot;throughout the [thirteen] colonies the terms &quot;Christian&quot;, &quot;free&quot;, &quot;English&quot;, and &quot;white&quot; were ... employed indiscriminately&quot; in the seventeenth century as proxies for one another. In 1680, Morgan Godwyn &quot;found it necessary to explain&quot; to English readers that &quot;in Barbados, &#x27;white&#x27; was &#x27;the general name for Europeans.&#x27;&quot; Several historians report a shift towards greater use of &quot;White&quot; as a legal category alongside a hardening of restrictions on free or Christian blacks. &quot;White&quot; remained a more familiar term in the American colonies than in Britain well into the 18th century, according to historian Theodore W. Allen.

=== Scientific racism ===

Western studies of race and ethnicity in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries developed into what would later be termed scientific racism. Prominent European pseudoscientists writing about human and natural difference included a &quot;White&quot; or &quot;West Eurasian&quot; race among a small set of human races and imputed physical, mental, or aesthetic superiority to this White category. These ideas were discredited by twentieth-century scientists.

==== Eighteenth century beginnings ====
In 1758, Carl Linnaeus proposed what he considered to be natural taxonomic categories of the human species. He distinguished between &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and &quot;Homo sapiens europaeus&quot;, and he later added four geographical subdivisions of humans: white Europeans, red Americans, yellow Asians and black Africans. Although Linnaeus intended them as objective classifications, his descriptions of these groups included cultural patterns and derogatory stereotypes.

In 1775, the naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach asserted that &quot;The white color holds the first place, such as is that of most European peoples. The redness of the cheeks in this variety is almost peculiar to it: at all events it is but seldom to be seen in the rest&quot;.

In the various editions of his &quot;On the Natural Variety of Mankind&quot;, he categorized humans into four or five races, largely built on Linnaeus&#x27; classifications. But while, in 1775, he had grouped into his &quot;first and most important&quot; race &quot;Europe, Asia this side of the Ganges, and all the country situated to the north of the Amoor, together with that part of North America, which is nearest both in position and character of the inhabitants&quot;, he somewhat narrows his &quot;Caucasian variety&quot; in the third edition of his text, of 1795: &quot;To this first variety belong the inhabitants of Europe (except the Lapps and the remaining descendants of the Finns) and those of Eastern Asia, as far as the river Obi, the Caspian Sea and the Ganges; and lastly, those of Northern Africa.&quot; Blumenbach quotes various other systems by his contemporaries, ranging from two to seven races, authored by the authorities of that time, including, besides Linnæus, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Christoph Meiners and Immanuel Kant. 

In the question of color, he conducts a rather thorough inquiry, considering also factors of diet and health, but ultimately believes that &quot;climate, and the influence of the soil and the temperature, together with the mode of life, have the greatest influence&quot;. Blumenbach&#x27;s conclusion was, however, to proclaim all races&#x27; attribution to one single human species. Blumenbach argued that physical characteristics like skin color, cranial profile, etc., depended on environmental factors, such as solarization and diet. Like other monogenists, Blumenbach held to the &quot;degenerative hypothesis&quot; of racial origins. He claimed that Adam and Eve were Caucasian inhabitants of Asia, and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors such as the sun and poor diet. He consistently believed that the degeneration could be reversed in a proper environmental control and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian race.

==== Nineteenth and twentieth century: the &quot;Caucasian race&quot; ====
Between the mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries, race scientists, including most physical anthropologists classified the world&#x27;s populations into three, four, or five races, which, depending on the authority consulted, were further divided into various sub-races. During this period the Caucasian race, named after people of the Caucasus Mountains but extending to all Europeans, figured as one of these races and was incorporated as a formal category of both pseudoscientific research and, in countries including the United States, social classification.

There was never any scholarly consensus on the delineation between the Caucasian race, including the populations of Europe, and the Mongoloid one, including the populations of East Asia. Thus, Carleton S. Coon (1939) included the populations native to all of Central and Northern Asia under the Caucasian label, while Thomas Henry Huxley (1870) classified the same populations as Mongoloid, and Lothrop Stoddard (1920) classified as &quot;brown&quot; most of the populations of the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, and counted as &quot;White&quot; only the European peoples and their descendants, as well as some populations in parts of Anatolia and the northern areas of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Some authorities, following Huxley (1870), distinguished the &quot;Xanthochroi&quot; or &quot;light Whites&quot; of Northern Europe with the &quot;Melanochroi&quot; or &quot;dark Whites&quot; of the Mediterranean.

Although modern neo-Nazis often invoke Nazi iconography on behalf of White nationalism, Nazi Germany repudiated the idea of a unified White race, instead promoting Nordicism. In Nazi propaganda, Eastern European Slavs were often referred to as Untermensch (subhuman in English), and the relatively under-developed economic status of Eastern European countries such as Poland and the USSR was attributed to the racial inferiority of their inhabitants. Fascist Italy took the same view, and both of these nations justified their colonial ambitions in Eastern Europe on racist, anti-Slavic grounds. These nations were not alone in their view; during the long nineteenth century and interwar period, there were numerous casesregardless of the position in the political spectrum of the personwhere European ethnic groups and nations labeled or treated other Europeans as members of another, somehow &quot;inferior race&quot;. Between the Enlightenment era and interwar period, the racist worldviews fit well into the liberal worldview, and they were almost general among the liberal thinkers and politicians.

== Census and social definitions in different regions ==
Definitions of White have changed over the years, including the official definitions used in many countries, such as the United States and Brazil. Through the mid to late twentieth century, numerous countries had formal legal standards or procedures defining racial categories (see cleanliness of blood, casta, apartheid in South Africa, hypodescent). Some countries do not ask questions about race or colour at all in their census.

=== Africa ===

==== South Africa ====
White Dutch people first arrived in South Africa around 1652. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, some 2,000 Europeans and their descendants were established in the region. Although these early Afrikaners represented various nationalities, including German peasants and French Huguenots, the community retained a thoroughly Dutch character.

The Kingdom of Great Britain captured Cape Town in 1795 during the Napoleonic Wars and permanently acquired South Africa from Amsterdam in 1814. The first British immigrants numbered about 4,000 and were introduced in 1820. They represented groups from England, Ireland, Scotland, or Wales and were typically more literate than the Dutch. The discovery of diamonds and gold led to a greater influx of English speakers who were able to develop the mining industry with capital unavailable to Afrikaners. They have been joined in more subsequent decades by former colonials from elsewhere, such as Zambia and Kenya, and poorer British nationals looking to escape famine at home.

Both Afrikaners and English have been politically dominant in South Africa during the past; due to the controversial racial order under &quot;apartheid&quot;, the nation&#x27;s predominantly Afrikaner government became a target of condemnation by other African states and the site of considerable dissension between 1948 and 1991.

There were 4.6 million Whites in South Africa in 2011, down from an all-time high of 5.2 million in 1995 following a wave of emigration commencing in the late twentieth century. However, many returned over time.

=== Asia ===

====Philippines====
In the Far East at Southeast Asia, in the Philippines, a genetic study by the National Geographic, shows that 5% of the population are Southern Europeans that had arrived due to the Spanish colonization of the archipelago, most of which are Spanish Filipinos There is also the presence of about 300,000 mostly White American citizens in the country .

====Hong Kong====
In the 2021 census of Hong Kong, 61,582 people identified as white representing 0.8% of the resident population, while 70,124 people (0.9%) were listed as &quot;other&quot;, which includes people who identify as more than one ethnic group.

=== Australia and Oceania ===
==== Australia ====
From 1788, when the first British colony in Australia was founded, until the early nineteenth century, most immigrants to Australia were English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish convicts. These were augmented by small numbers of free settlers from the British Isles and other European countries. However, until the mid-nineteenth century, there were few restrictions on immigration, although members of ethnic minorities tended to be assimilated into the Anglo-Celtic populations.

People of many nationalities, including many non-White people, emigrated to Australia during the gold rushes of the 1850s. However, the vast majority was still White and the gold rushes inspired the first racist activism and policy, directed mainly at Chinese immigrants.

From the late nineteenth century, the Colonial/State and later federal governments of Australia restricted all permanent immigration to the country by non-Europeans. These policies became known as the &quot;White Australia policy&quot;, which was consolidated and enabled by the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, but was never universally applied. Immigration inspectors were empowered to ask immigrants to take dictation from any European language as a test for admittance, a test used in practice to exclude people from Asia, Africa, and some European and South American countries, depending on the political climate.

Although they were not the prime targets of the policy, it was not until after World War II that large numbers of southern European and eastern European immigrants were admitted for the first time. Following this, the White Australia Policy was relaxed in stages: non-European nationals who could demonstrate European descent were admitted (e.g., descendants of European colonizers and settlers from Latin America or Africa), as were autochthonous inhabitants (such as Maronites, Assyrians and Mandeans) of various nations from the Middle East, most significantly from Lebanon and to a lesser degree Iraq, Syria and Iran. In 1973, all immigration restrictions based on race and geographic origin were officially terminated.

Australia enumerated its population by race between 1911 and 1966, by racial origin in 1971 and 1976, and by self-declared ancestry alone since 1981, meaning no attempt is now made to classify people according to skin color. As at the 2016 census, it was estimated by the Australian Human Rights Commission that around 58% of the Australian population were Anglo-Celtic Australians with 18% being of other European origins, a total of 76% for European ancestries as a whole. The 2021 Australian census form does not use the term &quot;white&quot;.

==== New Zealand ====
The establishment of British colonies in Australia from 1788 and the boom in whaling and sealing in the Southern Ocean brought many Europeans to the vicinity of New Zealand. Whalers and sealers were often itinerant, and the first real settlers were missionaries and traders in the Bay of Islands area from 1809. Early visitors to New Zealand included whalers, sealers, missionaries, mariners, and merchants, attracted to natural resources in abundance. They came from the Australian colonies, Great Britain and Ireland, Germany (forming the next biggest immigrant group after the British and Irish), France, Portugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United States, and Canada.

In the 1860s, the discovery of gold started a gold rush in Otago. By 1860 more than 100,000 British and Irish settlers lived throughout New Zealand. The Otago Association actively recruited settlers from Scotland, creating a definite Scottish influence in that region, while the Canterbury Association recruited settlers from the south of England, creating a definite English influence over that region.

In the 1870s, MP Julius Vogel borrowed millions of pounds from Britain to help fund capital development such as a nationwide rail system, lighthouses, ports, and bridges, and encouraged mass migration from Britain. By 1870 the non-Māori population reached over 250,000. Other smaller groups of settlers came from Germany, Scandinavia, and other parts of Europe as well as from China and India, but British and Irish settlers made up the vast majority and did so for the next 150 years.

The 2023 New Zealand census form doesn&#x27;t use the term &quot;white&quot;.

=== Europe ===

==== France ====
White people in France are a broad racial-based, or skin color-based, social category in French society.

In statistical terms, the French government banned the collection of racial or ethnic information in 1978, and the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), therefore, does not provide census data on White residents or citizens in France. French courts have, however, made cases, and issued rulings, which have identified White people as a demographic group within the country.

White people in France are defined, or discussed, as a racial or social grouping, from a diverse and often conflicting range of political and cultural perspectives; in anti-racism activism in France, from right-wing political dialogue or propaganda, and other sources.

===== Background =====
Whites in France have been studied with regard the group&#x27;s historical involvement in French colonialism; how &quot;whites in France have played a major international role in colonizing areas of the globe such as the African continent.&quot;

They have been described as a privileged social class within the country, comparatively sheltered from racism and poverty. has reported how &quot;most white people in France only know the banlieues as a kind of caricature&quot;. Banlieues, outer-city regions across the country that are increasingly identified with minority groups, often have residents who are disproportionately affected by unemployment and poverty.

The lack of census data collected by the INED and INSEE for Whites in France has been analyzed, from some academic perspectives, as masking racial issues within the country, or a form of false racial color blindness. Writing for Al Jazeera, French journalist Rokhaya Diallo suggests that &quot;a large portion of White people in France are not used to having frank conversations about race and racism.&quot; According to political sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, &quot;whites in France lie to themselves and the world by proclaiming that they do not have institutional racism in their nation.&quot; Sociologist Crystal Marie Fleming has written; &quot;While many whites in France refuse to acknowledge institutionalized racism and white supremacy, there is widespread belief in the specter of &#x27;anti-white racism&#x27;&quot;.

===== Use in right-wing politics =====
Accusations of anti-White racism, suggestions of the displacement of, or lack of representation for, the group, and rhetoric surrounding Whites in France experiencing poverty have been, at times, utilised by various right-wing political elements in the country. University of Lyon&#x27;s political scientist Angéline Escafré-Dublet has written that &quot;the equivalent to a White backlash in France can be traced through the debate over the purported neglect of the &#x27;poor Whites&#x27; in France&quot;.

In 2006, French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen suggested there were too many &quot;players of colour&quot; in the France national football team after he suggested that 7 of the 23-player squad were White. In 2020, French politician Nadine Morano stated that French actress Aïssa Maïga, who was born in Senegal, should &quot;go back to Africa&quot; if she &quot;was not happy with seeing so many white people in France&quot;.

==== Republic of Ireland ====

According to the 2022 Irish census, 4,444,145 or 87.4% of the total population declared their race as “White Irish” and Other White, this was a decline from 92.4% in 2016 and 94.24% in 2011.

People who identified as “White Irish” in 2022 were 3,893,056 or 76.5% of the total population, a decline from 87.4% in 2006.

==== Malta ====
As of the 2021 census, 89.1% self-identified as Caucasian racial origin. Maltese-born natives make up the majority of the island with 386,280 people out of a total population of 519,562. However, there are minorities, the largest of which by European birthplace were: 15,082 from the United Kingdom, Italy (13,361) and Serbia (5,935). Among racial origins for the non-Maltese, 58.1% of all identified as Caucasian.

==== Historical White identities ====
Before the Industrial Revolutions in Europe, whiteness may have been associated with social status. Aristocrats may have had less exposure to the sun and therefore a pale complexion may have been associated with status and wealth. This may be the origin of &quot;blue blood&quot; as a description of royalty, the skin being so lightly pigmented that the blueness of the veins could be clearly seen. The change in the meaning of White that occurred in the colonies (see above) to distinguish Europeans from non-Europeans did not apply to the &#x27;home land&#x27; countries (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales). Whiteness therefore retained a meaning associated with social status for the time being, and, during the nineteenth century, when the British Empire was at its peak, many of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy developed extremely negative attitudes to those of lower social rank.

Edward Lhuyd discovered that Welsh, Gaelic, Cornish and Breton are all part of the same language family, which he termed the &quot;Celtic family&quot;, and was distinct from the Germanic English; this can be seen in context of the emerging romantic nationalism, which was also prevalent among those of Celtic descent.

Just as race reified whiteness in America, Africa, and Asia, capitalism without social welfare reified whiteness with regard to social class in nineteenth-century Britain and Ireland; this social distinction of whiteness became, over time, associated with racial differences. For example, George Sims in his 1883 book &quot;How the poor live&quot; wrote of &quot;a dark continent that is within easy reach of the General Post Office ... the wild races who inhabit it will, I trust, gain public sympathy as easily as [other] savage tribes&quot;.

==== Modern and official use ====
From the early 18th century, Britain received a small-scale immigration of black people due to the transatlantic slave trade. The oldest Chinese community in Britain (as well as in Europe) dates from the nineteenth century. Since the end of World War II, a substantial immigration from the African, Caribbean and South Asian (namely the British Raj) colonies changed the picture more radically, while the adhesion to the European Union brought with it a heightened immigration from Central and Eastern Europe.

Today the Office for National Statistics uses the term &quot;White&quot; as an ethnic category. The terms &quot;White British&quot;, &quot;White Irish&quot;, &quot;White Scottish&quot; and &quot;White Other&quot; are used. These classifications rely on individuals&#x27; self-identification, since it is recognised that ethnic identity is not an objective category. Socially, in the UK &quot;White&quot; usually refers only to people of native British, Irish and European origin. As a result of the 2011 census the White population stood at 85.5% in England (White British: 79.8%), at 96% in Scotland (White British: 91.8%), at 95.6% in Wales (White British: 93.2%), while in Northern Ireland 98.28% identified themselves as White, amounting to a total of 87.2% White population (or White British and Irish).

=== North America ===

==== Bermuda (U.K.) ====
At the 2016 census the number of Bermudians who identify as white was 19,466 or 31 percent of the total population. The White population of Bermuda made up the entirety of the Bermuda&#x27;s population, other than a black and an Indian slave brought in for a very short-lived pearl fishery in 1616, from settlement (which began accidentally in 1609 with the wreck of the Sea Venture) until the middle of the 17th century, and the majority until some point in the 18th century.

In 2010, census data found that White Bermudians accounted for 31% including 10% native Bermudians and 21% foreign-born.

==== Canada ====
Of the over 36 million Canadians enumerated in 2021 approximately 25 million reported being &quot;White&quot;, representing 69.8 percent of the population.

In the 1995 Employment Equity Act, &quot;&#x27;members of visible minorities&#x27; means persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour&quot;. In the 2001 Census, persons who selected Chinese, South Asian, African, Filipino, Latin American, Southeast Asian, Arab, West Asian, Middle Eastern, Japanese, or Korean were included in the visible minority population. A separate census question on &quot;cultural or ethnic origin&quot; (question 17) does not refer to skin color.

==== Costa Rica ====
The 2022 census counted a total population of 5,044,197 people. In 2022, the census also recorded ethnic or racial identity for all groups separately for the first time in more than ninety-five years since the 1927 census. Options included indigenous, Black or Afro-descendant, Mulatto, Chinese, Mestizo, white and other on section IV: question 7.
White people (including mestizo) make up 94%, 3% are black people, 1% are Amerindians, and 1% are Chinese. White Costa Ricans are mostly of Spanish ancestry, but there are also significant numbers of Costa Ricans descended from British, Italian, German, English, Dutch, French, Irish, Portuguese and Polish families, as well a sizable Jewish (namely Ashkenazi and Sephardic) community.

==== Cuba ====

White people in Cuba make up 64.1% of the total population according to the 2012 census with the majority being of diverse Spanish descent. However, after the mass exodus resulting from the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the number of white Cubans actually residing in Cuba diminished. Today various records claiming the percentage of Whites in Cuba are conflicting and uncertain; some reports (usually coming from Cuba) still report a less, but similar, pre-1959 number of 65% and others (usually from outside observers) report a 40–45%. Despite most White Cubans being of Spanish descent, many others are of French, Portuguese, German, Italian and Russian descent.

During the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early part of the twentieth century, large waves of Canarians, Catalans, Andalusians, Castilians, and Galicians emigrated to Cuba. Many European Jews have also immigrated there, with some of them being Sephardic. Between 1901 and 1958, more than a million Spaniards arrived to Cuba from Spain; many of these and their descendants left after Castro&#x27;s communist regime took power. Historically, Chinese descendants in Cuba were classified as White.

In 1953, it was estimated that 72.8% of Cubans were of European ancestry, mainly of Spanish origin, 12.4% of African ancestry, 14.5% of both African and European ancestry (mulattos), and 0.3% of the population was of Chinese and or East Asian descent (officially called &quot;amarilla&quot; or &quot;yellow&quot; in the census). However, after the Cuban revolution, due to a combination of factors, mainly mass exodus to Miami, United States, a drastic decrease in immigration, and interracial reproduction, Cuba&#x27;s demography changed. As a result, those of complete European ancestry and those of pure African ancestry have decreased, the mixed population has increased, and the Chinese (or East Asian) population has, for all intents and purposes, disappeared.

The Institute for Cuban and Cuban American Studies at the University of Miami says the present Cuban population is 38% White and 62% Black/Mulatto. The Minority Rights Group International says that &quot;An objective assessment of the situation of Afro-Cubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution. Estimates of the percentage of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously, ranging from 33.9 per cent to 62 per cent&quot;.

==== Dominican Republic ====

They are 18.7% of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s population, according to a 2022 survey by the United Nations Population Fund. The majority of white Dominicans have ancestry from the first European settlers to arrive in Hispaniola in 1492 and are descendants of the Spanish and Portuguese who settled in the island during colonial times, as well as the French who settled in the 17th and 18th centuries. About 9.2% of the Dominican population claims a European immigrant background, according to the 2021 Fondo de Población de las Naciones Unidas survey.

==== El Salvador ====

According to 2007 estimates, white people accounted for 12.7% of the population.

==== Guatemala ====

In 2010, 18.5% of Guatemalans belonged to the White ethnic group, with 41.7% of the population being Mestizo, and 39.8% of the population belonging to the 23 Indigenous groups. It is difficult to make an accurate census of Whites in Guatemala, because the country categorizes all non-indigenous people are mestizo or ladino and a large majority of White Guatemalans consider themselves as mestizos or ladinos. By the nineteenth century the majority of immigrants were Germans, many who were bestowed fincas and coffee plantations in Cobán, while others went to Quetzaltenango and Guatemala City. Many young Germans married mestiza and indigenous Q&#x27;eqchi&#x27; women, which caused a gradual whitening. There was also immigration of Belgians to Santo Tomas and this contributed to the mixture of black and mestiza women in that region.

==== Honduras ====

The &quot;World Factbook&quot; reports that white people are 1% of the population of Honduras.

==== Mexico ====

White Mexicans are Mexicans of total or predominantly European or West Asian ancestry. The Mexican government conducts ethnic censuses that allow individuals to identify as &quot;White&quot;, but the specific results of these censuses are not made public. Instead, the government releases data on the percentage of &quot;light-skinned Mexicans&quot; in the country, with nationwide surveys conducted by the Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Statistics and the National Council to Prevent Discrimination reporting results that estimate them at about one-third of the country&#x27;s population. The term &quot;Light-skinned Mexican&quot; is preferred by both the government and media to describe individuals in Mexico who possess European physical traits when discussing ethno-racial dynamics. However, &quot;White Mexican&quot; is still used at times.

Europeans began arriving in Mexico during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire; and while during the colonial period, most European immigration was Spanish (mostly from northern provinces such as Cantabria, Navarra, Galicia and the Basque Country,), in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries European and European-derived populations from North and South America did immigrate to the country. According to twentieth- and twenty-first-century academics, large-scale intermixing between the European immigrants and the native Indigenous peoples produced a Mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of Mexico&#x27;s population by the time of the Mexican Revolution. However, according to church and censal registers from the colonial times, the majority of Spanish men married Spanish women. Said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics, such as European immigrants who arrived to Mexico being almost exclusively men or that &quot;pure Spanish&quot; people were all part of a small powerful elite, as Spaniards were often the most numerous ethnic group in the colonial cities and there were menial workers and people in poverty who were of complete Spanish origin.

Another ethnic group in Mexico, the Mestizos, is composed of people with varying degrees of European and indigenous ancestry, with some showing a European genetic ancestry higher than 90%. However, the criteria for defining what constitutes a Mestizo varies from study to study, as in Mexico a large number of White people have been historically classified as Mestizos, because after the Mexican Revolution the Mexican government began defining ethnicity on cultural standards (mainly the language spoken) rather than racial ones in an effort to unite all Mexicans under the same racial identity.

Estimates of Mexico&#x27;s White population differ greatly in both, methodology and percentages given, extra-official sources such as the &quot;World Factbook&quot;, which use the 1921 census results as the base of their estimations, calculate Mexico&#x27;s White population as only 10% (the results of the 1921 census, however, have been contested by various historians and deemed inaccurate). other sources suggest rather higher percentages: using the presence of blond hair as reference to classify a Mexican as White, the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the percentage of said ethnic group at 23% within said institution. With a similar methodology, the American Sociological Association obtained a percentage of 18.8%. Another study made by the University College London in collaboration with Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Anthropology and History found that the frequencies of blond hair and light eyes in Mexicans are of 18% and 28% respectively.

A study performed in hospitals of Mexico City suggests that socioeconomic factors influence the frequency of Mongolian spots among newborns, as evidenced by the higher prevalence of 85% in newborns from a public institution, typically associated with lower socioeconomic status, compared to a 33% prevalence in newborns from private hospitals, which generally cater to families with higher socioeconomic status. The Mongolian spot appears with a very high frequency (85-95%) in Native American, and African children, but can be present in some individuals in the Mediterranean populations. The skin lesion reportedly almost always appears on South American and Mexican children who are racially Mestizos, while having a very low frequency (5–10%) in European children. According to the Mexican Social Security Institute (shortened as IMSS) nationwide, around half of Mexican babies have the Mongolian spot.

Mexico&#x27;s northern and western regions have the highest percentages of white population, with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly European ancestry. In the north and west of Mexico the indigenous tribes were substantially smaller and unlike those found in central and southern Mexico they were mostly nomadic, therefore remaining isolated from colonial population centers, with hostilities between them and Mexican colonists often taking place. This eventually led the northeast region of the country to become the region with the highest proportion of whites during the Spanish colonial period albeit recent migration waves have been changing its demographic trends. A number of settlements on which European immigrants have maintained their original culture and language survive to this day and are spread all over Mexican territory; among the most notable groups are the Mennonites who have colonies in states as variated as Chihuahua or Campeche and the town of Chipilo in the state of Puebla, inhabited nearly in its totality by descendants of Italian immigrants that still speak their Venetian-derived dialect.

==== Nicaragua ====
The &quot;World Factbook&quot; reports white people being 17% of the Nicaragua&#x27;s population, with an additional 69% of the population being Mestizo, which is described as mixed indigenous and white. In the nineteenth century, Nicaragua was the subject of central European immigration, mostly from Germany, England and the United States, who often married native Nicaraguan women. Some Germans were given land to grow coffee in Matagalpa, Jinotega and Esteli, although most Europeans settled in San Juan del Norte. In the late seventeenth century, pirates from England, France and Holland mixed with the indigenous population and started a settlement at Bluefields (Mosquito Coast).

==== Puerto Rico (U.S.)====

Puerto Rico had a small stream of predominantly European immigration. Puerto Ricans of Spanish, Italian and French descent comprise the majority.
According to the most recent 2020 census, the number of people who identified as &quot;White alone&quot; was 536,044 with an additional non-Hispanic 24,548, for a total of 560,592 or 17.1% of the population.

Previously in 1899, one year after the United States acquired the island, 61.8% or 589,426 people self-identified as White. One hundred years later (2000), the total increased to 80.5% or 3,064,862; due to a change of race perceptions, mainly because of Puerto Rican elites to portray Puerto Rico&#x27;s image as the &quot;White island of the Antilles&quot;, partly as a response to scientific racism.

Hundreds are from Corsica, France, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Scotland, and Germany, along with large numbers of immigrants from Spain. This was the result of granted land from Spain during the &quot;Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815&quot; (Royal Decree of Graces of 1815), which allowed European Catholics to settle on the island with a certain amount of free land.
Between 1960 and 1990, the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or color. Racial categories therefore disappeared from the dominant discourse on the Puerto Rican nation. However, the 2000 census included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico and, for the first time since 1950, allowed respondents to choose more than one racial category to indicate mixed ancestry. (Only 4.2% chose two or more races.) With few variations, the census of Puerto Rico used the same questionnaire as in the U.S. mainland. According to census reports, most islanders responded to the new federally mandated categories on race and ethnicity by declaring themselves &quot;White&quot;; few declared themselves to be Black or some other race. However, it was estimated that 20% of White Puerto Ricans may have Black ancestry.

==== Trinidad and Tobago ====

==== United States ====


The cultural boundaries separating White Americans from other racial or ethnic categories are contested and always changing. Professor David R. Roediger of the University of Illinois, suggests that the construction of the White race in the United States was an effort to mentally distance slave owners from slaves. By the eighteenth century, &quot;White&quot; had become well established as a racial term. Author John Tehranian has noted the changing classifications of immigrant ethnic groups in American history. At various times each of the following groups has been allegedly excluded from being considered White, despite generally having been considered legally White under the US census and US naturalization law: Germans, Greeks, White Hispanics, Arabs, Iranians, Afghans, Irish, Italians, Jews of European and Mizrahi descent, Slavs, and Spaniards. On several occasions Finns were &quot;racially&quot; discriminated against in their early years of immigration and not considered European but &quot;Asian&quot;. Some believed that they were of Mongolian ancestry rather than &quot;native&quot; European origin due to the Finnish language belonging to the Uralic and not the Indo-European language family.

During American history, the process of officially being defined as &quot;White&quot; by law often came about in court disputes over the pursuit of citizenship. The Immigration Act of 1790 offered naturalization only to &quot;any alien, being a free white person&quot;. In at least 52 cases, people denied the status of White by immigration officials sued in court for status as White people. By 1923, courts had vindicated a &quot;common-knowledge&quot; standard, concluding that &quot;scientific evidence&quot; was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian says that this was a &quot;performance-based&quot; standard, relating to religious practices, education, intermarriage, and a community&#x27;s role in the United States.

In 1923, the Supreme Court decided in &quot;United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind&quot; that people of Indian descent were not White men, and thus not eligible for citizenship. While Thind was a high caste Hindu born in the northern Punjab region and classified by certain scientific authorities as of the Aryan race, the court conceded that he was not White or Caucasian since the word Aryan &quot;has to do with linguistic and not at all with physical characteristics&quot; and &quot;the average man knows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences&quot; between Indians and White people. In &quot;United States v. Cartozian&quot; (1925), an Armenian immigrant successfully argued (and the Supreme Court agreed) that his nationality was White in contradistinction to other people of the Near EastKurds, Turks, and Arabs in particularon the basis of their Christian religious traditions. In conflicting rulings &quot;In re Hassan&quot; (1942) and &quot;Ex parte Mohriez&quot;, United States District Courts found that Arabs did not, and did qualify as White, respectively, under immigration law.

In the early twenty-first century, the relationship between some ethnic groups and whiteness remains complex. In particular, some Jewish and Arab individuals both self-identify and are considered as part of the White American racial category, but others with the same ancestry feel they are not White and may not always be perceived as White by American society. The United States Census Bureau proposed but withdrew plans to add a new category for Middle Eastern and North African peoples in the U.S. Census 2020. Specialists disputed whether this classification should be considered a White ethnicity or a race. According to Frank Sweet, &quot;various sources agree that, on average, people with 12 percent or less admixture appear White to the average American and those with up to 25 percent look ambiguous (with a Mediterranean skin tone)&quot;.

The current U.S. Census definition includes as White &quot;a person having origins in any of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.&quot; The U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Federal Bureau of Investigation describes White people as &quot;having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa through racial categories used in the Uniform Crime Reports Program adopted from the &quot;Statistical Policy Handbook&quot; (1978) and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce.&quot; The &quot;White&quot; category in the UCR includes non-black Hispanics.

White Americans made up nearly 90% of the population in 1950. A report from the Pew Research Center in 2008 projects that by 2050, non-Hispanic White Americans will make up 47% of the population, down from 67% projected in 2005. According to a study on the genetic ancestry of Americans, White Americans (stated &quot;European Americans&quot;) on average are 98.6% European, 0.2% African and 0.2% Native American. Whites born in those Southern states with higher proportions of African-American populations, tend to have higher percentages of African ancestry. For instance, according to the 23andMe database, up to 13% of self-identified White American Southerners have greater than 1% African ancestry. White persons born in Southern states with the highest African-American populations tended to have the highest percentages of hidden African ancestry. Robert P. Stuckert, member of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Ohio State University, has said that today the majority of the descendants of African slaves are White.

Black author Rich Benjamin, in his book, &quot;Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America&quot;, reveals how racial divides and White decline, both real and perceived, shape democratic and economic urgencies in America. The book examines how White flight, and the fear of White decline, affects the country&#x27;s political debates and policy-making, including housing, lifestyle, social psychology, gun control, and community. Benjamin says that such issues as fiscal policy or immigration or &quot;Best Place to Live&quot; lists, which might be considered race-neutral, are also defined by racial anxiety over perceived White decline.

==== One-drop rule ====

The &quot;one-drop rule&quot; – that a person with any amount of known black African ancestry (however small or invisible) is considered black – is a classification that was used in parts of the United States. It is a colloquial term for a set of laws passed by 18 U.S. states between 1910 and 1931. Such laws were declared unconstitutional in 1967 when the Supreme Court ruled on anti-miscegenation laws while hearing &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;; it also found that Virginia&#x27;s Racial Integrity Act of 1924, based on enforcing the one-drop rule in classifying vital records, was unconstitutional. The one-drop rule attempted to create a binary system, classifying all persons as either Black or White regardless of a person&#x27;s physical appearance. Previously persons had sometimes been classified as mulatto or mixed-race, including on censuses up to 1930. They were also recorded as Indian. Some people with a high proportion of European ancestry could pass as &quot;White&quot;, as noted above. This binary approach contrasts with the more flexible social structures present in Latin America (derived from the Spanish colonial era system), where there were less clear-cut divisions between various ethnicities. People are often classified not only by their appearance but by their class.

As a result of centuries of having children with White people, the majority of African Americans have some European admixture, and many people long accepted as White also have some African ancestry. Among the most notable examples of the latter is President Barack Obama, who is believed to have been descended from an early African enslaved in America, recorded as &quot;John Punch&quot;, through his mother&#x27;s apparently White line.

In the twenty-first century, writer and editor Debra Dickerson renewed questions about the one-drop rule, saying that &quot;easily one-third of black people have White DNA&quot;. She says that, in ignoring their European ancestry, African Americans are denying their full multi-racial identities. Singer Mariah Carey, who is multi-racial, was publicly described as &quot;another White girl trying to sing black&quot;. But in an interview with Larry King, she said that, despite her physical appearance and having been raised primarily by her White mother, she did not &quot;feel White&quot;.

Since the late twentieth century, genetic testing has provided many Americans, both those who identify as White and those who identify as black, with more nuanced and complex information about their genetic backgrounds.

====Other Caribbean====
=== South America ===
==== Argentina ====
Argentina, along with other areas of new settlement like Canada, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, the United States or Uruguay, is considered a country of immigrants where the vast majority originated from Europe. White people can be found in all areas of the country, but especially in the central-eastern region (Pampas), the central-western region (Cuyo), the southern region (Patagonia) and the north-eastern region (Litoral).

White Argentines are mainly descendants of immigrants who came from Europe and the Middle East in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After the regimented Spanish colonists, waves of European settlers came to Argentina from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Major contributors included Italy (initially from Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania, Calabria, and Sicily), and Spain (most are Galicians and Basques, but there are Asturians, Cantabrians, Catalans, and Andalusians). Smaller but significant numbers of immigrants include Germans, primarily Volga Germans from Russia, but also Germans from Germany, Switzerland, and Austria; French which mainly came from the Occitania region of France; Portuguese, which already conformed an important community since colonial times; Slavic groups, most of which were Croats, Bosniaks, Poles, but also Ukrainians, Belarusians, Russians, Bulgarians, Serbs and Montenegrins; Britons, mainly from England and Wales; Irish who migrated due to the Great Irish Famine or prior famines and Scandinavians from Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway. Smaller waves of settlers from Australia and South Africa, and the United States can be traced in Argentine immigration records.

By the 1910s, after immigration rates peaked, over 30 percent of the country&#x27;s population was from outside Argentina, and over half of Buenos Aires&#x27; population was foreign-born.
However, the 1914 National Census revealed that around 80% of the national population were either European immigrants, their children or grandchildren. Among the remaining 20 percent (those descended from the population residing locally before this immigrant wave took shape in the 1870s), around a third were White. European immigration continued to account for over half the nation&#x27;s population growth during the 1920s and was again significant (albeit in a smaller wave) following World War II. It is estimated that Argentina received over 6 million European immigrants during the period 1857–1940.

Since the 1960s, increasing immigration from bordering countries to the north (especially from Bolivia and Paraguay, which have Amerindian and Mestizo majorities) has lessened that majority somewhat.

Criticism of the national census states that data has historically been collected using the category of national origin rather than race in Argentina, leading to undercounting Afro-Argentines and Mestizos. (Living Africa) is a black rights group in Buenos Aires with the support of the Organization of American States, financial aid from the World Bank and Argentina&#x27;s census bureau is working to add an &quot;Afro-descendants&quot; category to the 2010 census. The 1887 national census was the final year where blacks were included as a separate category before it was eliminated by the government.

==== Bolivia ====

There is no present day data as the Bolivian census does not count racial identity for white people. However, past census data showed that in 1900, people who self-identified as &quot;Blanco&quot; (white) composed 12.7% or 231,088 of the total population. This was the last time data on race was collected. There were 529 Italians, 420 Spaniards, 295 Germans, 279 French, 177 Austrians, 141 English and 23 Belgians living in Bolivia.

==== Brazil ====


Recent censuses in Brazil are conducted on the basis of self-identification. According to the 2022 Census, they totaled 88,252,121 people and made up 43.5% of the Brazilian population.

As a term, &quot;White&quot; in Brazil is generally applied to people of European descent. The term may also encompass other people, such as Brazilians of West Asian descent, and in some contexts, East Asians. Though Brazilians of East Asian descent are, in other contexts, classified as &quot;Yellow&quot; (amarela). The census shows a trend of fewer Brazilians of a different descent (most likely mixed) identifying as White people as their social status increases. Nevertheless, light-skinned Mulattoes and Mestizos with European features were also historically deemed as more closely related to &quot;whiteness&quot; then unmixed Blacks.

==== Chile ====

Scholarly estimates of the White population in Chile vary dramatically, ranging from 20% to 52%. According to a study by the University of Chile about 30% of the Chilean population is Caucasian, while the 2011 Latinobarómetro survey shows that some 60% of Chileans consider themselves White.

During colonial times in the eighteenth century, an important flux of emigrants from Spain populated Chile, mostly Basques, who vitalized the Chilean economy and rose rapidly in the social hierarchy and became the political elite that still dominates the country. An estimated 1.6 million (10%) to 3.2 million (20%) Chileans have a surname (one or both) of Basque origin. The Basques liked Chile because of its great similarity to their native land: similar geography, cool climate, and the presence of fruits, seafood, and wine.

Chile was not an attractive place for European migrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries simply because it was far from Europe and difficult to reach. Chile experienced a tiny but steady arrival of Spanish, Italians, Irish, French, Greeks, Germans, English, Scots, Croats and Ashkenazi Jews, in addition to immigration from other Latin American countries.

The original arrival of Spaniards was the most radical change in demographics due to the arrival of Europeans in Chile, since there was never a period of massive immigration, in contrast to neighboring nations such as Argentina and Uruguay. Facts about the amount of immigration do not coincide with certain national chauvinistic discourse, which claims that Chile, like Argentina or Uruguay, would be considered one of the &quot;White&quot; Latin American countries, in contrast to the racial mixture that prevails in the rest of the continent. However, it is undeniable that immigrants have played a major role in Chilean society. Between 1851 and 1924 Chile only received 0.5% of the European immigration flow to Latin America, compared to the 46% received by Argentina, 33% by Brazil, 14% by Cuba, and 4% by Uruguay. This was because most of the migration occurred across the Atlantic before the construction of the Panama Canal. Europeans preferred to stay in countries closer to their homelands instead of taking the long trip through the Straits of Magellan or across the Andes. In 1907, European-born immigrants composed 2.4% of the Chilean population, which fell to 1.8% in 1920, and 1.5% in 1930.

After the failed liberal revolution of 1848 in the German states, a significant German immigration took place, laying the foundation for the German-Chilean community. Sponsored by the Chilean government to &quot;civilize&quot; and colonize the southern region, these Germans (including German-speaking Swiss, Silesians, Alsatians and Austrians) settled mainly in Valdivia, Llanquihue and Los Ángeles. The Chilean Embassy in Germany estimated 150,000 to 200,000 Chileans are of German origin.

Another historically significant immigrant group were Croatian immigrants. The Croatian Chileans, their descendants today, number at an estimated 380,000 persons, the equivalent of 2.4% of the population. Other authors claim on the other hand, that close to 4.6% of the Chilean population have some Croatian ancestry. Over 700,000 Chileans may have British (English, Scottish or Welsh) origin, 4.5% of Chile&#x27;s population. Chileans of Greek descent are estimated 90,000 to 120,000. Most of them live either in the Santiago area or in the Antofagasta area, and Chile is one of the 5 countries with the most descendants of Greeks in the world. The descendants of the Swiss reach 90,000 and it is estimated that about 5% of the Chilean population has some French ancestry. 184,000–800,000 (estimates) are descendants of Italians. Other groups of European descendants are found in smaller numbers.

==== Colombia ====
The Colombian government does not carry out official racial censuses, nor does it carry out self-identification racial censuses as is the case in Argentina, so the figures shown are usually based on data from populations considered &quot;non-ethnic&quot;, which are those (Whites and Mestizos). According to the 2018 census, approximately 87.6% of the Colombian population are White or Mestizo.

Many Spanish began their explorations searching for gold, while other Spanish established themselves as leaders of the native social organizations teaching natives the Christian faith and the ways of their civilization. Catholic priests would provide education for Native Americans that otherwise was unavailable. 100 years after the first Spanish settlement, 90 percent of all Native Americans in Colombia had died. The majority of the deaths of Native Americans were the cause of diseases such as measles and smallpox, which were spread by European settlers. Many Native Americans were also killed by armed conflicts with European settlers.

Between 1540 and 1559, 8.9 percent of the residents of Colombia were of Basque origin. It has been suggested that the present-day incidence of business entrepreneurship in the region of Antioquia is attributable to the Basque immigration and Basque character traits. Few Colombians of distant Basque descent are aware of their Basque ethnic heritage. In Bogota, there is a small colony of thirty to forty families who emigrated as a consequence of the Spanish Civil War or because of different opportunities. Basque priests were the ones who introduced handball into Colombia. Basque immigrants in Colombia were devoted to teaching and public administration. In the first years of the Andean multinational company, Basque sailors navigated as captains and pilots on the majority of the ships until the country was able to train its own crews.

In December 1941 the United States government estimated that there were 4,000 Germans living in Colombia. There were some Nazi agitators in Colombia, such as Barranquilla businessman Emil Prufurt. Colombia invited Germans who were on the U.S. blacklist to leave. SCADTA, a Colombian-German air transport corporation that was established by German expatriates in 1919, was the first commercial airline in the Western Hemisphere.

The Italians arrived on the Colombian coast, and quickly moved towards the expanding agricultural areas. There, some of them achieved success in the commercialization of livestock, agricultural products, and imported goods, which later led to the transfer of their lucrative activities to Barranquilla. Some important buildings were created by Italians in the nineteenth century, like the famous Colón Theater of the capital. It is one of the most representative theatres of Colombia, with neoclassic architecture: was built by the Italian architect Pietro Cantini and founded in 1892; has more than 2,400 square metres (26,000 sq ft) for 900 people. This famous Italian architect also contributed to the construction of the Capitolio Nacional of the capital. Oreste Sindici was an Italian-born Colombian musician and composer, who composed the music for the Colombian national anthem in 1887. Oreste Sindici died in Bogotá on 12 January 1904, due to severe arteriosclerosis. In 1937 the Colombian government honored his memory. After the Second World War, Italian emigration to Colombia was directed primarily toward Bogota, Cali and Medellin. They have Italian schools in Bogota (Institutes &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; and &quot;Alessandro Volta&quot;), Medellín (&quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;) &amp; Barranquilla (&quot;Galileo Galilei&quot;). The Italian migration government estimates that there are at least 2 million Colombians of Italian descent, making them the second largest and most numerous European group in the country after the Spanish.

The first and largest wave of immigration from the Middle East began around 1880 and remained during the first two decades of the twentieth century. They were mainly Maronite Christians from Greater Syria (Syria and Lebanon) and Palestine, fleeing the then colonized Ottoman territories. Syrians, Palestinians, and Lebanese continued since then to settle in Colombia. Due to poor existing information it is impossible to know the exact number of Lebanese and Syrians that immigrated to Colombia. A figure of 5,000–10,000 from 1880 to 1930 may be reliable. Whatever the figure, Syrians and Lebanese are perhaps the biggest immigrant group next to the Spanish since independence. Those who left their homeland in the Middle East to settle in Colombia left for different reasons such as religious, economic, and political reasons. Some left to experience the adventure of migration. After Barranquilla and Cartagena, Bogota stuck next to Cali, among cities with the largest number of Arabic-speaking representatives in Colombia in 1945. The Arabs that went to Maicao were mostly Sunni Muslim with some Druze and Shiites, as well as Orthodox and Maronite Christians. The mosque of Maicao is the second largest mosque in Latin America. Middle Easterns are generally called (Turkish).

====Ecuador====

According to the most-recent 2022 national census, 2.2% of Ecuadorians self-identified as European Ecuadorian, a decrease from 6.1% in 2010.

==== Guyana ====
In 2016, 0.3% of Guyana were of European descent, predominantly Portuguese Guyanese.

==== Paraguay ====

==== Peru ====
According to the 2017 census 5.9% or 1.3 million (1,336,931) people 12 years of age and above self-identified as White. There were 619,402 (5.5%) males and 747,528 (6.3%) females. This was the first time a question for ethnic origins had been asked. The regions with the highest proportion of self-identified Whites were in La Libertad (10.5%), Tumbes and Lambayeque (9.0% each), Piura (8.1%), Callao (7.7%), Cajamarca (7.5%), Lima Province (7.2%) and Lima Region (6.0%).

==== Suriname ====
In 2012, there were 1,667 or 0.3% of the population identified as white.
Many Dutch settlers left Suriname after independence in 1975 and this diminished Suriname&#x27;s Dutch population. Currently there are around 1,000 boeroes left in Suriname, and 3,000 outside Suriname.

==== Uruguay ====
Different estimates state that Uruguay&#x27;s population of 3.4 million is composed of 88% to 93% White Uruguayans. Though Uruguay has welcomed immigrants from around the world, its population largely consists of people of European origin, mainly Spaniards and Italians. Other European immigrants include Jews from Eastern and Central Europe.
According to the 2006 National Survey of Homes by the Uruguayan National Institute of Statistics: 94.6% self-identified as having a White background, 9.1% chose black ancestry, and 4.5% chose an Amerindian ancestry (people surveyed were allowed to choose more than one option).

==== Venezuela ====

According to the official Venezuelan census, the term &quot;White&quot; involves external issues such as light skin, shape, and color of hair and eyes, among other factors. Though the meaning and usage of the term &quot;White&quot; has varied in different ways depending on the time period and area, leaving its precise definition as somewhat confusing. The 2011 Venezuelan Census states that &quot;White&quot; in Venezuela is used to describe Venezuelans of European origin. The 2011 National Population and Housing Census states that 43.6% of the Venezuelan population (approx. 13.1 million people) identify as White. Genetic research by the University of Brasília shows an average admixture of 60.6% European, 23.0% Amerindian and 16.3% African ancestry in Venezuelan populations. The majority of White Venezuelans are of Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German descent. Nearly half a million European immigrants, mostly from Spain (as a consequence of the Spanish Civil War), Italy, and Portugal, entered the country during and after World War II, attracted by a prosperous, rapidly developing country where educated and skilled immigrants were welcomed.

Spaniards were introduced into Venezuela during the colonial period. Most of them were from Andalusia, Galicia, Basque Country and from the Canary Islands. Until the last years of World War II, a large part of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands, and its cultural impact was significant, influencing the development of Castilian in the country, its gastronomy, and customs. With the beginning of oil operations during the first decades of the twentieth century, citizens and companies from the United States, United Kingdom, and Netherlands established themselves in Venezuela. Later, in the middle of the century, there was a new wave of originating immigrants from Spain (mainly from Galicia, Andalucia and the Basque Country), Italy (mainly from southern Italy and Venice) and Portugal (from Madeira) and new immigrants from Germany, France, England, Croatia, Netherlands, and other European countries, among others, animated simultaneously by the program of immigration and colonization implanted by the government.

It features tools for developing and debugging C++ code, especially code written for the Windows API, DirectX and .NET.

Many applications require redistributable Visual C++ runtime library packages to function correctly. These packages are frequently installed separately from the applications they support, enabling multiple applications to use the package with only a single installation. These Visual C++ redistributable and runtime packages are mostly installed for standard libraries that many applications use.

== History ==
The predecessor to Visual C++ was called &quot;Microsoft C/C++&quot;. There was also a &quot;Microsoft QuickC&quot; 2.5 and a &quot;Microsoft QuickC for Windows&quot; 1.0. The Visual C++ compiler is still known as &quot;Microsoft C/C++&quot; and as of the release of Visual C++ 2015 Update 2, is on version 14.0.23918.0.

=== 16-bit versions ===
* Microsoft C 1.0, based on Lattice C, was Microsoft&#x27;s first C product in 1983. It was not K&amp;R C compliant.
* C 2.0 added large model support, allowing up to 1MiB for both the Code Segment and Data Segment.
* C 3.0 was the first version developed inside Microsoft. This version intended compatibility with K&amp;R and the later ANSI standard. It was being used inside Microsoft (for Windows and Xenix development) in early 1984. It shipped as a product in 1985.
* C 4.0 added optimizations and CodeView, a source-level debugger.
* C 5.0 added loop optimizations and huge memory model (arrays bigger than 64 KB) support.
* C 5.1 released in 1988 allowed compiling programs for OS/2 1.x. The fourteen 5.25&quot; disk (two of which were 1.2 MB, the others 360k) version included QuickC. The eleven 720k 3.5&quot; disk version included with the OS/2 Software Development Kit included MASM 5.1 (a single executable that worked under both MSDOS and OS/2 1.x).
* C 6.0 released in 1989 added support for tiny memory model and better support for the ANSI C89 standard (the documentation explicitly says that it is not 100% compliant but it appears to be close enough for practical purposes). It added the &quot;Programmer&#x27;s Workbench&quot; IDE, global flow analysis, a source browser, and a new debugger. To the surprise of many, C++ was not included even though competitors already had offerings.
* C/C++ 7.0 was released in 1992. Dropped OS/2 support. Compilation required a 386 processor plus the included DOS extender, 386MAX, though for users to be able to target DOS extenders in their own programs they write, one of several later-released third-party tools was required. Added built-in support for C++ and MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class Library) 1.0.
* Visual C++ 1.0, which included MFC 2.0, was the first version of &quot;Visual&quot; C++, released in February 1993. It was Cfront 2.1 compliant and available in two editions:
** Standard: replaced QuickC for Windows.
** Professional: replaced C/C++ 7.0. Included the ability to build both DOS and Windows applications, an optimizing compiler, a source profiler, and the Windows 3.1 SDK. The Phar Lap 286 DOS Extender Lite was also included.
* Visual C++ 1.5 was released in December 1993, included MFC 2.5, and added OLE 2.0 and ODBC support to MFC. It was the first version of Visual C++ that came only on CD-ROM.
** Visual C++ 1.51 and 1.52 were available as part of a subscription service.
** Visual C++ 1.52b is similar to 1.52, but does not include the Control Development Kit.
** Visual C++ 1.52c was a patched version of 1.5. It is the last, and arguably most popular, development platform for Microsoft Windows 3.x. It is available through Microsoft Developer Network.

=== Strictly 32-bit versions ===
* Visual C++ 1.0 (original name: Visual C++ 32-bit Edition) released in 1993 was the first version for 32-bit development (and requiring 32-bit Windows NT as a host) for the Intel 386 architecture. Although released when 16-bit version 1.5 was available, it did not include support for OLE2 and ODBC. It was also available in a bundle called Visual C++ 16/32-bit Suite, which included Visual C++ 1.5.
* Visual C++ 2.0, which included MFC 3.0, was the first version to be 32-bit only. In many ways, this version was ahead of its time, since Windows 95, then codenamed &quot;Chicago&quot;, was not yet released, and Windows NT had only a small market share. Microsoft included and updated Visual C++ 1.5 as part of the 2.x releases up to 2.1, which included Visual C++ 1.52, and both 16-bit and 32-bit version of the Control Development Kit (CDK) were included. Visual C++ 2.x also supported Win32s development. It is available through Microsoft Developer Network. There was a Visual C++ 2.0 RISC Edition for MIPS and Alpha processors, as well as a cross-platform edition for the Macintosh (68000 instruction set).
** Microsoft Visual C++ Cross-Development Edition for the Macintosh was an add-on for Visual C++ that introduced the Windows Portability Library, originally known as Windows Library for Macintosh or Windows Layer for the Macintosh (WLM), allowing developers to write applications against the Win32 and MFC APIs that could be compiled for 68000 architecture Macintosh computers.
** Visual C++ 2.1 and 2.2 were updates for 2.0 available through subscription.
* Visual C++ 4.0, released on 1995-12-11, introduced the Developer Studio IDE. Its then-novel tiled layout of non-overlapping panels—navigation panel, combination editor/source level debugger panel, and console output panel—continues through the Visual Studio product line (as of 2013). Visual C++ 4.0 included MFC 4.0, was designed for Windows 95 and Windows NT. To allow support of legacy (Windows 3.x/DOS) projects, 4.0 came bundled with the Visual C++ 1.52 installation CD. Updates available through subscription included Visual C++ 4.1, which came with the Microsoft Game SDK (later released separately as the DirectX SDK), and Visual C++ 4.2. Version number 3.0 was skipped to achieve version number parity between Visual C++ 4.0 and MFC 4.0.
* Visual C++ 4.2 did not support Windows 3.x (Win32s) development. This was the final version with a cross-platform edition for the Mac available and it differed from the 2.x version in that it also allowed compilation for the PowerPC instruction set.
* Visual C++ 5.0 (bundled with Visual Studio 97) which included MFC 4.21 and was released 1997-04-28, was a major upgrade from 4.2. Available in four editions: Learning, Professional, Enterprise, and RISC.
* Visual C++ 6.0 (commonly known as VC6, and available standalone in Standard, Professional and Enterprise editions, as well as bundled with Visual Studio 6.0), which included MFC 6.0, was released in 1998. The release was somewhat controversial since it did not include an expected update to MFC. Visual C++ 6.0 is still quite popular and often used to maintain legacy projects. There are, however, issues with this version under Windows XP, especially under the debugging mode (for example, the values of static variables do not display). The debugging issues can be solved with a patch called the &quot;Visual C++ 6.0 Processor Pack&quot;. Version number: 12.00.8804
* Visual C++ .NET 2002 (also known as Visual C++ 7.0), which included MFC 7.0, was released in 2002 with support for link time code generation and debugging runtime checks, .NET 1.0, and Visual C# and Managed C++. The new user interface used many of the hot keys and conventions of Visual Basic, which accounted for some of its unpopularity among C++ developers. Version number: 13.00.9466
* Visual C++ .NET 2003 (also known as Visual C++ 7.1), which included MFC 7.1, was released in 2003 along with .NET 1.1 and was a major upgrade to Visual C++ .NET 2002, and was the first version to support the C99 &quot;long long&quot; construct. It was considered a patch to Visual C++ .NET 2002. Accordingly, the English language upgrade version of Visual Studio .NET 2003 shipped for minimal cost to owners of the English-language version of Visual Studio .NET 2002. Windows 98 is the lowest officially supported version. Although simple programs will work on Windows 95 and NT 4.0, more complex programs may cause things like ws2_32.dll to be referenced, or functions missing in kernel32.dll. In later versions (Visual C++ 2005) of the compiler even simple programs won&#x27;t work (unless you replace the C library) because they have a reference to function IsDebuggerPresent in kernel32.dll which only exists in Windows 98 and later. Version number: 13.10.3077
* eMbedded Visual C++ in various versions was used to develop for some versions of the Windows CE operating system. Initially it replaced a development environment consisting of tools added onto Visual C++ 6.0. eMbedded Visual C++ was replaced as a separate development environment by Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.

=== 32-bit and 64-bit versions ===
* Visual C++ 2005 (also known as Visual C++ 8.0), which included MFC 8.0, was released in November 2005. This version supports .NET 2.0 and includes a new version of C++ targeted to the .NET framework (C++/CLI) with the purpose of replacing the previous version (Managed C++). Managed C++ for CLI is still available via compiler options, though. It also introduced OpenMP. With Visual C++ 2005, Microsoft also introduced Team Foundation Server. Visual C++ 8.0 has problems compiling MFC AppWizard projects that were created using Visual Studio 6.0, so maintenance of legacy projects can be continued with the original IDE if rewriting is not feasible. Visual C++ 2005 is the last version able to target Windows 98 and Windows Me. SP1 version (14.00.50727.762) is also available in Microsoft Windows SDK Update for Windows Vista.
* Visual C++ 2008 (also known as Visual C++ 9.0) was released in November 2007. This version supports .NET 3.5. Managed C++ for CLI is still available via compiler options. By default, all applications compiled against the Visual C++ 2008 Runtimes (static and dynamic linking) will only work on Windows 2000, Windows XP SP2 and later. A feature pack released for VC9, later included in SP1, added support for C++ TR1 library extensions. SP1 version (15.00.30729.01) is also available in Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7.
* Some versions of Visual C++ supported Itanium 2.
* Visual C++ 2010 (also known as Visual C++ 10.0) was released on April 12, 2010. It uses a SQL Server Compact database to store information about the source code, including IntelliSense information, for better IntelliSense and code-completion support. However, Visual C++ 2010 does not support Intellisense for C++/CLI. This version adds a C++ parallel computing library called the Parallel Patterns Library, partial support for C++11, significantly improved IntelliSense based on the Edison Design Group front end, and performance improvements to both the compiler and generated code. This version is built on .NET 4.0, but supports compiling to machine code. The partial C++11 support mainly consists of six compiler features: lambdas, rvalue references, auto, decltype, static_assert, and nullptr. C++11 also supports library features (e.g., moving the TR1 components from std::tr1 namespace directly to std namespace). Variadic templates were also considered, but delayed until some future version due to having a lower priority, which stemmed from the fact that, unlike other costly-to-implement features (lambda, rvalue references), variadic templates would benefit only a minority of library writers rather than the majority of compiler end users. By default, all applications compiled against Visual C++ 2010 Runtimes only work on Windows XP SP2 and later. The RTM version (16.00.30319) is also available in Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4 (WinSDK v7.1). SP1 version (16.00.40219) is available as part of Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 or through the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1 Compiler Update for the Windows SDK 7.1.
* Visual C++ 2012 (also known as Visual C++ 11.0) was released on August 15, 2012. It features improved C++11 support, and support for Windows Runtime development.
* Visual C++ 2013 (also known as Visual C++ 12.0) was released on October 17, 2013. It features further C++11 and C99 support, and introduces a REST SDK.
* Visual C++ 2015 (also known as Visual C++ 14.0) was released on July 20, 2015. It features improved C++11/14/17 support. Without any announcement from Microsoft, Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 started generating telemetry calls in compiled binaries. After some users contacted Microsoft about this problem, Microsoft said they would remove these telemetry calls when compiling with the future Visual Studio 2015 Update 3. The function in question was removed from the Visual C++ CRT static libraries in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3.
* Visual C++ 2017 (also known as Visual C++ 14.1) was released on March 7, 2017.
* Visual C++ 2019 (also known as Visual C++ 14.20) was released on April 2, 2019.
* Visual C++ 2022 (also known as Visual C++ 14.30) was released on November 8, 2021.

=== Internal version numbering ===
There are several different version numbers to consider when working with Visual C or C++. The oldest and most original of these is the compiler version number, which has been monotonically increased since the early Microsoft C compiler days. This is the version returned by running the command codice_1 on its own without any options. By taking two digits after the decimal and dropping the decimal point, this also becomes the value of the C pre-processor macro: codice_2, and the CMake variable: codice_3. A longer version of the C macro is codice_4 to make more finely-grained distinctions between builds of the compiler. An example of codice_2 is 1933 to represent version 19.33 of the Microsoft C/C++ compiler, and of codice_4 is 193331630.

The Visual product version, such as &quot;17.3.4&quot;, designates the version of Visual Studio with which version 19.33 of the compiler was packaged. Then there is the Microsoft Visual C/C++ Runtime Library version, e.g. &quot;14.3&quot;. From this, one can also deduce the toolset version, which can be obtained by taking the first three digits of the runtime library version and dropping the decimal, e.g. &quot;143&quot;. It includes the Visual C/C++ runtime library, as well as compilers, linkers, assemblers, other build tools, and matching libraries and header files. The following is a (scrapeable) table of the known correlated version numbers.

== Compatibility ==

=== ABI ===
The Visual C++ compiler ABI has historically changed between major compiler releases. This is especially the case for STL containers, where container sizes have varied a lot between compiler releases. Microsoft therefore recommends against using C++ interfaces at module boundaries when one wants to enable client code compiled using a different compiler version. Instead of C++, Microsoft recommends using C or COM interfaces, which are designed to have a stable ABI between compiler releases.

All 14.x MSVC releases have a stable ABI, and binaries built with these versions can be mixed in a forwards-compatible manner, noting the following restrictions:
* The toolset version used must be equal to or higher than the highest toolset version used to build any linked binaries.
* The MSVC Redistributable version must be equal to or higher than the toolset version used by any application component.
* Static libraries or object files compiled with /GL (Whole program optimisation) are not binary compatible between versions and must use the exact same toolset.

=== C runtime libraries ===
Visual C++ ships with different versions of C runtime libraries. This means users can compile their code with any of the available libraries. However, this can cause some problems when using different components (DLLs, EXEs) in the same program. A typical example is a program using different libraries. The user should use the same C Run-Time for all the program&#x27;s components unless the implications are understood. Microsoft recommends using the multithreaded, dynamic link library (/MD or /MDd compiler option) to avoid possible problems.

==== POSIX ====
Although Microsoft&#x27;s CRT implements a large subset of POSIX interfaces, the Visual C++ compiler will emit a warning on &quot;every&quot; use of such functions by default. The rationale is that C and C++ standards require an underscore prefix before implementation-defined interfaces, so the use of these functions are non-standard. However, systems that are actually POSIX-compliant would not accept these underscored names, and it is more portable to just turn off the warning instead.

=== C ===
Although the product originated as an IDE for the C programming language, for many years the compiler&#x27;s support for that language conformed only to the original edition of the C standard, dating from 1989, but not the C99 revision of the standard. There had been no plans to support C99 even in 2011, more than a decade after its publication.

Visual C++ 2013 finally added support for various C99 features in its C mode (including designated initializers, compound literals, and the codice_7 type), though it was still not complete. Visual C++ 2015 further improved the C99 support, with full support of the C99 Standard Library, except for features that require C99 language features not yet supported by the compiler.

Most of the changes from the C11 revision of the standard were still not supported by Visual C++ 2017. For example, generic selections via the codice_8 keyword are not supported by the compiler and result in a syntax error.

The preprocessor was overhauled in 2018, with C11 in sight:

codice_8 support has been committed to MSVC as of February 2020.

In September 2020, Microsoft announced C11 and C17 standards support in MSVC would arrive in version 16.8. This did not include optional features but Microsoft indicated that they were planning to add support for atomics and threads at a later date. In version 17.5, partial (since atomic locks are missing) and experimental (meaning hidden behind the compiler flag codice_10) support for atomics was added and in version 17.8, support for threads was added, this time not behind a compiler flag.

=== C++ ===
With default settings MSVC does not do two-phase name lookup which prevents it from flagging a wide range of invalid code. Most checks are deferred to template instantiation. More recent versions remedy this behavior, but it needs to be enabled by the command-line option codice_11.

==Reception==
Describing it as &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;BYTE&quot; in February 1989 approved of Microsoft C 5.1&#x27;s OS/2 support, QuickC for interactive development, and CodeView debugger. Although Watcom C produced slightly faster code, the magazine said that developers &quot;might still prefer Microsoft&#x27;s friendlier and more powerful tools&quot;.

<doc id="166206" wikidata="Q1171224" url="?curid=166206" title="Indirection">
<text>In computer programming, an indirection (also called a reference) is a way of referring to something using a name, reference, or container instead of the value itself. The most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating a value through its memory address. For example, accessing a variable through the use of a pointer. A stored pointer that exists to provide a reference to an object by double indirection is called an &quot;indirection node&quot;. In some older computer architectures, indirect words supported a variety of more-or-less complicated addressing modes.

Another important example is the domain name system which enables names such as codice_1 to be used in place
of network addresses such as codice_2. The indirection from human-readable names to network addresses means that the references to a web page become more memorable, and links do not need to change when a web site is relocated to a different server.

==Overview==
A famous aphorism of Butler Lampson that is attributed to David Wheeler goes: &quot;All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection&quot; (the &quot;fundamental theorem of software engineering&quot;).
This is often deliberately mis-quoted with &quot;abstraction layer&quot; substituted for &quot;level of indirection&quot;. A corollary to this aphorism, and the original conclusion from Wheeler, is &quot;...except for the problem of too many layers of indirection.&quot;

A humorous Internet memorandum, , insists that:
Object-oriented programming makes use of indirection extensively, a simple example being dynamic dispatch. Higher-level examples of indirection are the design patterns of the proxy and the proxy server. Delegation is another classic example of an indirection pattern. In strongly typed interpreted languages with dynamic data types, most variable references require a level of indirection: first the type of the variable is checked for safety, and then the pointer to the actual value is dereferenced and acted on.

Recursive data types are usually implemented using indirection, because otherwise if a value of a data type can contain the entirety of another value of the same data type, there is no limit to the size a value of this data type could need.

When doing symbolic programming from a formal mathematical specification the use of indirection can be quite helpful. To start with a simple example the variables &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; in an equation such as formula_1 can refer to any number. One could imagine objects for various numbers and then &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; could point to the specific numbers being used for a particular problem. The simple example has its limitation as there are infinitely many real numbers. In various other parts of symbolic programming there are only so many symbols. So to move on to a more significant example, in logic the formula &quot;α&quot; can refer to any formula, so it could be &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, &quot;δ&quot;, ... or &quot;η&quot;→&quot;π&quot;, &quot;ς&quot; ∨ &quot;σ&quot;, ... When set-builder notation is employed the statement Δ={&quot;α&quot;} means the set of all formulae — so although the reference is to &quot;α&quot; there are two levels of indirection here, the first to the set of all &quot;α&quot; and then the second to a specific formula for each occurrence of &quot;α&quot; in the set Δ.

<doc id="166208" wikidata="Q772835" url="?curid=166208" title="Linguistic anthropology">
<text>Linguistic anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of how language influences social life. It is a branch of anthropology that originated from the endeavor to document endangered languages and has grown over the past century to encompass most aspects of language structure and use.

Linguistic anthropology explores how language shapes communication, forms social identity and group membership, organizes large-scale cultural beliefs and ideologies, and develops a common cultural representation of natural and social worlds.

==Historical development==
Linguistic anthropology emerged from the development of three distinct paradigms that have set the standard for approaching linguistic anthropology. The first, now known as &quot;anthropological linguistics,&quot; focuses on the documentation of languages. The second, known as &quot;linguistic anthropology,&quot; engages in theoretical studies of language use. The third, developed over the past two or three decades, studies issues from other subfields of anthropology with linguistic considerations. Though they developed sequentially, all three paradigms are still practiced today.

===First paradigm: anthropological linguistics===

The first paradigm, anthropological linguistics, is devoted to themes unique to the sub-discipline. This area includes documentation of languages that have been seen as at-risk for extinction, with a particular focus on indigenous languages of native North American tribes. It is also the paradigm most focused on linguistics. Linguistic themes include the following:

* Grammatical description,
*Typological classification and
*Linguistic relativity

===Second paradigm: linguistic anthropology===
The second paradigm can be marked by reversing the words. Going from &quot;anthropological linguistics&quot; to &quot;linguistic anthropology&quot;, signals a more anthropological focus on the study. This term was preferred by Dell Hymes, who was also responsible, with John Gumperz, for the idea of ethnography of communication. The term &quot;linguistic anthropology&quot; reflected Hymes&#x27; vision of a future where language would be studied in the context of the situation and relative to the community speaking it. This new era would involve many new technological developments, such as mechanical recording.

This paradigm developed in critical dialogue with the fields of folklore on the one hand and linguistics on the other. Hymes criticized folklorists&#x27; fixation on oral texts rather than the verbal artistry of performance. At the same time, he criticized the cognitivist shift in linguistics heralded by the pioneering work of Noam Chomsky, arguing for an ethnographic focus on language in use. 

Hymes had many revolutionary contributions to linguistic anthropology, the first of which was a new unit of analysis. Unlike the first paradigm, which focused on linguistic tools like measuring of phonemes and morphemes, the second paradigm&#x27;s unit of analysis was the &quot;speech event&quot;. A speech event is defined as one with speech presented for a significant duration throughout its occurrence (ex., a lecture or debate). This is different from a speech situation, where speech could possibly occur (ex., dinner). Hymes also pioneered a linguistic anthropological approach to ethnopoetics. Hymes had hoped that this paradigm would link linguistic anthropology more to anthropology. However, Hymes&#x27; ambition backfired as the second paradigm marked a distancing of the sub-discipline from the rest of anthropology.

=== Third paradigm: anthropological issues studied via linguistic methods and data ===
The third paradigm, which began in the late 1980s, redirected the primary focus on anthropology by providing a linguistic approach to anthropological issues. Rather than prioritizing the technical components of language, third paradigm anthropologists focus on studying culture through the use of linguistic tools. Themes include:

* investigations of personal and social identities
* shared ideologies
* construction of narrative interactions among individuals

Furthermore, similar to how the second paradigm used new technology in its studies, the third paradigm heavily includes use of video documentation to support research.

== Areas of interest ==
Contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three paradigms described above:

# Documentation of languages
# Study of language through context
# The study of identity through linguistic means

The third paradigm, the study of anthropological issues through linguistic means, is an affluent area of study for current linguistic anthropologists.

===Identity and intersubjectivity===
A great deal of work in linguistic anthropology investigates questions of sociocultural identity linguistically and discursively. Linguistic anthropologist Don Kulick has done so in relation to identity, for example, in a series of settings, first in a village called Gapun in northern Papua New Guinea. He explored how the use of two languages with and around children in Gapun village: the traditional language (Taiap), not spoken anywhere but in their own village and thus primordially &quot;indexical&quot; of Gapuner identity, and Tok Pisin, the widely circulating official language of New Guinea. (&quot;indexical&quot; points to meanings beyond the immediate context.) To speak the Taiap language is associated with one identity: not only local but &quot;Backward&quot; and also an identity based on the display of hed (personal autonomy). To speak Tok Pisin is to index a modern, Catholic identity, based not on hed but on save, an identity linked with the will and the skill to cooperate. In later work, Kulick demonstrates that certain loud speech performances in Brazil called um escândalo, Brazilian &quot;travesti&quot; (roughly, &#x27;transvestite&#x27;) sex workers shame clients. The travesti community, the argument goes, ends up at least making a powerful attempt to transcend the shame the larger Brazilian public might try to foist off on them, again by loud public discourse and other modes of performance.

In addition, scholars such as Émile Benveniste, Mary Bucholtz and Kira Hall Benjamin Lee, Paul Kockelman, and Stanton Wortham (among many others) have contributed to understandings of identity as &quot;intersubjectivity&quot; by examining the ways it is discursively constructed.

===Socialization===
In a series of studies, linguistic anthropologists Elinor Ochs and Bambi Schieffelin addressed the anthropological topic of socialization (the process by which infants, children, and foreigners become members of a community, learning to participate in its culture), using linguistic and other ethnographic methods. They discovered that the processes of enculturation and socialization do not occur apart from the process of language acquisition, but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process. Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that baby talk is not universal, that the direction of adaptation (whether the child is made to adapt to the ongoing situation of speech around it or vice versa) was a variable that correlated, for example, with the direction it was held vis-à-vis a caregiver&#x27;s body. In many societies caregivers hold a child facing outward so as to orient it to a network of kin whom it must learn to recognize early in life.

Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that members of all societies socialize children both &quot;to&quot; and &quot;through&quot; the use of language. Ochs and Schieffelin uncovered how, through naturally occurring stories told during dinners in white middle class households in Southern California, both mothers and fathers participated in replicating male dominance (the &quot;father knows best&quot; syndrome) by the distribution of participant roles such as protagonist (often a child but sometimes mother and almost never the father) and &quot;problematizer&quot; (often the father, who raised uncomfortable questions or challenged the competence of the protagonist). When mothers collaborated with children to get their stories told, they unwittingly set themselves up to be subject to this process.

Schieffelin&#x27;s more recent research has uncovered the socializing role of pastors and other fairly new Bosavi converts in the Southern Highlands, Papua New Guinea community she studies. Pastors have introduced new ways of conveying knowledge, new linguistic epistemic markers—and new ways of speaking about time. And they have struggled with and largely resisted those parts of the Bible that speak of being able to know the inner states of others (e.g. the gospel of Mark, chapter 2, verses 6–8).

===Ideologies===
In a third example of the current (third) paradigm, since Roman Jakobson&#x27;s student Michael Silverstein opened the way, there has been an increase in the work done by linguistic anthropologists on the major anthropological theme of ideologies,—in this case &quot;language ideologies&quot;, sometimes defined as &quot;shared bodies of commonsense notions about the nature of language in the world.&quot; Silverstein has demonstrated that these ideologies are not mere false consciousness but actually influence the evolution of linguistic structures, including the dropping of &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; from everyday English usage. Woolard, in her overview of &quot;code switching&quot;, or the systematic practice of alternating linguistic varieties within a conversation or even a single utterance, finds the underlying question anthropologists ask of the practice—Why do they do that?—reflects a dominant linguistic ideology. It is the ideology that people should &quot;really&quot; be monoglot and efficiently targeted toward referential clarity rather than diverting themselves with the messiness of multiple varieties in play at a single time.

Much research on linguistic ideologies probes subtler influences on language, such as the pull exerted on Tewa, a Kiowa-Tanoan language spoken in certain New Mexican pueblos and on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona, by &quot;kiva speech&quot;, discussed in the next section.

Other linguists have carried out research in the areas of language contact, language endangerment, and &#x27;English as a global language&#x27;. For instance, Indian linguist Braj Kachru investigated local varieties of English in South Asia, the ways in which English functions as a lingua franca among multicultural groups in India. British linguist David Crystal has contributed to investigations of language death attention to the effects of cultural assimilation resulting in the spread of one dominant language in situations of colonialism.

===Heritage language ideologies===
More recently, a new line of ideology work is beginning to enter the field of linguistics in relation to heritage languages. Specifically, applied linguist Martin Guardado has posited that heritage language ideologies are &quot;somewhat fluid sets of understandings, justifications, beliefs, and judgments that linguistic minorities hold about their languages.&quot; Guardado goes on to argue that ideologies of heritage languages also contain the expectations and desires of linguistic minority families &quot;regarding the relevance of these languages in their children’s lives as well as when, where, how, and to what ends these languages should be used.&quot; Although this is arguably a fledgling line of language ideology research, this work is poised to contribute to the understanding of how ideologies of language operate in a variety of settings.

===Social space===
In a final example of this third paradigm, a group of linguistic anthropologists have done very creative work on the idea of social space. Duranti published a groundbreaking article on Samoan greetings and their use and transformation of social space. Before that, Indonesianist Joseph Errington, making use of earlier work by Indonesianists not necessarily concerned with language issues per se, brought linguistic anthropological methods (and semiotic theory) to bear on the notion of the exemplary center, the center of political and ritual power from which emanated exemplary behavior. Errington demonstrated how the Javanese priyayi, whose ancestors served at the Javanese royal courts, became emissaries, so to speak, long after those courts had ceased to exist, representing throughout Java the highest example of &quot;refined speech.&quot; The work of Joel Kuipers develops this theme vis-a-vis the island of Sumba, Indonesia. And, even though it pertains to Tewa Indians in Arizona rather than Indonesians, Paul Kroskrity&#x27;s argument that speech forms originating in the Tewa kiva (or underground ceremonial space) forms the dominant model for all Tewa speech can be seen as a direct parallel.

Silverstein tries to find the maximum theoretical significance and applicability in this idea of exemplary centers. He feels, in fact, that the exemplary center idea is one of linguistic anthropology&#x27;s three most important findings. He generalizes the notion thus, arguing &quot;there are wider-scale institutional &#x27;orders of interactionality,&#x27; historically contingent yet structured. Within such large-scale, macrosocial orders, in-effect ritual centers of semiosis come to exert a structuring, value-conferring influence on any particular event of discursive interaction with respect to the meanings and significance of the verbal and other semiotic forms used in it.&quot; Current approaches to such classic anthropological topics as ritual by linguistic anthropologists emphasize not static linguistic structures but the unfolding in realtime of a hypertrophic&#x27; set of parallel orders of iconicity and indexicality that seem to cause the ritual to create its own sacred space through what appears, often, to be the magic of textual and nontextual metricalizations, synchronized.&quot;

===Race, class, and gender===
Addressing the broad central concerns of the subfield and drawing from its core theories, many scholars focus on the intersections of language and the particularly salient social constructs of race (and ethnicity), class, and gender (and sexuality). These works generally consider the roles of social structures (e.g., ideologies and institutions) related to race, class, and gender (e.g., marriage, labor, pop culture, education) in terms of their constructions and in terms of individuals&#x27; lived experiences.

===Ethnopoetics===

Ethnopoetics is a method of recording text versions of oral poetry or narrative performances (i.e. verbal lore) that uses poetic lines, verses, and stanzas (instead of prose paragraphs) to capture the formal, poetic performance elements which would otherwise be lost in the written texts. The goal of any ethnopoetic text is to show how the techniques of unique oral performers enhance the aesthetic value of their performances within their specific cultural contexts. Major contributors to ethnopoetic theory include Jerome Rothenberg, Dennis Tedlock, and Dell Hymes. Ethnopoetics is considered a subfield of ethnology, anthropology, folkloristics, stylistics, linguistics, and literature and translation studies.

=== Endangered languages: language documentation and revitalization ===
Endangered languages are languages that are not being passed down to children as their mother tongue or that have declining numbers of speakers for a variety of reasons. Therefore, after a couple generations these languages may no longer be spoken. Anthropologists have been involved with endangered language communities through their involvement in language documentation and revitalization projects. 

In a language documentation project, researchers work to develop records of the language - these records could be field notes and audio or video recordings. To follow best practices of documentation, these records should be clearly annotated and kept safe within an archive of some kind. Franz Boas was one of the first anthropologists involved in language documentation within North America and he supported the development of three key materials: 1) grammars, 2) texts, and 3) dictionaries. This is now known as the Boasian Trilogy. 

Language revitalization is the practice of bringing a language back into common use. The revitalization efforts can take the form of teaching the language to new speakers or encouraging the continued use within the community. One example of a language revitalization project is the Lenape language course taught at Swathmore College, Pennsylvania. The course aims to educate indigenous and non-indigenous students about the Lenape language and culture. 

Language reclamation, as a subset of revitalization, implies that a language has been taken away from a community and addresses their concern in taking back the agency to revitalize their language on their own terms. Language reclamation addresses the power dynamics associated with language loss. Encouraging those who already know the language to use it, increasing the domains of usage, and increasing the overall prestige of the language are all components of reclamation. One example of this is the Miami language being brought back from &#x27;extinct&#x27; status through extensive archives. 

While the field of linguistics has also been focused on the study of the linguistic structures of endangered languages, anthropologists also contribute to this field through their emphasize on ethnographic understandings of the socio-historical context of language endangerment, but also of language revitalization and reclamation projects.

<text>Virginie Fernández (born 15 November 1976), known by her stage name Virginie Ledoyen (), is a French actress. She has appeared in French, English and American films.

==Life and career==
Ledoyen was born in Paris and raised in Aubervilliers, the daughter of Olga, a restaurateur, and Bernard Fernández, a merchant who sold cleaning products and knives. Her paternal grandfather was Spanish. She was a print model from the age of two and later took on the stage name &quot;Ledoyen&quot; after the maiden name of her maternal grandmother, who was a stage actress. 

Ledoyen&#x27;s film breakthrough came with &quot;A Single Girl&quot; (1995) (stylized &quot;la fille seule&quot;), for which she was nominated for a César Award for Most Promising Actress. She also received two César Award nominations for &quot;Les marmottes&quot; (1993) and &quot;L&#x27;eau froide&quot; (1994). Outside France, her best-known role is in &quot;The Beach&quot; (2000). In the fall of 2000, she signed a contract as a spokesmodel with the cosmetics company L&#x27;Oréal. She was featured alongside two models, Laetitia Casta and Noémie Lenoir.
She portrayed the character Cosette in the 2000 French television miniseries of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

On 29 September 2001, Ledoyen gave birth to her first child, a girl named Lila, with production designer Louis Soubrier, whom she met on the set of &quot;La fille seule&quot; in 1995. She was in a short-lived marriage with Iain Rogers, a film director, from 2006 to 2007. From 2007 to 2015, she was in a relationship with actor Arie Elmaleh, whose brother was her co-star in &quot;The Valet&quot;. Ledoyen and Elmaleh have a son, Isaac, born in July 2010, and a daughter, Amalia, born in April 2014.

In 2013 Ledoyen was named as a member of the jury at the 70th Venice International Film Festival.

<text>The human condition can be defined as the characteristics and key events of human life, including birth, learning, emotion, aspiration, reason, morality, conflict, and death. This is a very broad topic that has been and continues to be pondered and analyzed from many perspectives, including those of art, biology, literature, philosophy, psychology, and religion.

As a literary term, &quot;human condition&quot; is typically used in the context of ambiguous subjects, such as the meaning of life or moral concerns.

==Some perspectives==
Each major religion has definitive beliefs regarding the human condition. For example, Buddhism teaches that existence is a perpetual cycle of suffering, death, and rebirth from which humans can be liberated via the Noble Eightfold Path. Meanwhile, many Christians believe that humans are born in a sinful condition and are doomed in the afterlife unless they receive salvation through Jesus Christ.

Philosophers have provided many perspectives. An influential ancient view was that of the &quot;Republic&quot; in which Plato explored the question &quot;what is justice?&quot; and postulated that it is not primarily a matter among individuals but of society as a whole, prompting him to devise a utopia. Two thousand years later René Descartes declared &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; because he believed the human mind, particularly its faculty of reason, to be the primary determiner of truth; for this he is often credited as the father of modern philosophy. One such modern school, existentialism, attempts to reconcile an individual&#x27;s sense of disorientation and confusion in a universe believed to be absurd.

Many works of literature provide a perspective on the human condition. One famous example is Shakespeare&#x27;s monologue &quot;All the world&#x27;s a stage&quot; which pensively summarizes seven phases of human life.

Psychology has many theories, including Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs and the notions of identity crisis and terror management. It also has various methods, e.g. the logotherapy developed by Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl to discover and affirm a sense of meaning. Another method, cognitive behavioral therapy, has become a widespread treatment for clinical depression.

Charles Darwin established the biological theory of evolution, which posits that the human species is related to all others, living and extinct, and that natural selection is the primary survival factor. This led to subsequent beliefs, such as social Darwinism, which eventually lost its connection to natural selection, and theistic evolution of a creator deity acting through laws of nature, including evolution.

<text>The University of Tokyo (, abbreviated as Tōdai (東大) in Japanese and UTokyo in English) is a public research university in Bunkyō, Tokyo, Japan. Founded in 1877 as the nation&#x27;s first modern university by the merger of several pre-westernisation era institutions, its direct precursors include the Tenmongata, founded in 1684, and the Shoheizaka Institute.

Although established under its current name, the university was renamed in 1886 and was further retitled to distinguish it from other imperial universities established later. It served under this name until the official dissolution of the Empire of Japan in 1947, when it reverted to its original name. 

Today, the university consists of 10 faculties, 15 graduate schools, and 11 affiliated research institutes. As of 2023, it has a total of 13,974 undergraduate students and 14,258 graduate students. The majority of the university&#x27;s educational and research facilities are concentrated within its three main Tokyo campuses: Hongo, Komaba, and Kashiwa. Additionally, UTokyo operates several smaller campuses in the Greater Tokyo Area and over 60 facilities across Japan and globally. UTokyo&#x27;s total land holdings amount to 326 square kilometres (approximately 80,586 acres or 32,600 hectares), placing it amongst the largest landowners in the country.

==History==

=== Origins ===

The University of Tokyo traces its roots to three independent institutes founded during the Edo period (1603–1868). The oldest, a Shogun-funded Confucian school called , was founded in 1630 by Razan Hayashi in Ueno. This school was renamed the and came to be operated directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1791 as part of the &quot;Kansei Reforms&quot;. The &quot;Tenmongata&quot;, established in 1684, was the astronomical research and education arm of the Shogunate. It evolved into the , a school for Western learnings, after the Meiji Restoration. The Kanda Otamagaike Vaccination Centre, established in 1858, evolved into a school of Western medicine called . Although plans to establish the country&#x27;s first university had been in place just after the Meiji Restoration, it was not until around 1875 that it was decided to form the university by merging these schools.

=== Founding and early days ===

The University of Tokyo was chartered on April 12, 1877, by the Meiji government. Corresponding to the fields covered by the predecessor schools, it started with four faculties: Law, Science, Letters, and Medicine. The Imperial College of Engineering later merged into the university and became the Faculty of Engineering. In 1886, the university was renamed Imperial University, and it adopted the name Tokyo Imperial University in 1897 after the founding of the next imperial university, what is now Kyoto University. By 1888, all faculties had completed their relocation to the former site of the Tokyo house of the Maeda family in Hongo, where they continue to operate today. Among the few extant structures built before this relocation is a gate called Akamon, which has become a widely recognised symbol of the university.

During its initial two decades as a modern institution, UTokyo benefited from the contributions of European and American scholars. In 1871, the Meiji Government made a decision about the direction of academic disciplines: engineering was to be learnt from the United Kingdom, mathematics, physics, and international law from France, while politics, economics, and medicine were to be guided by German expertise. Additionally, agriculture and commercial law knowledge was to be sourced from the United States. Following this policy, UTokyo and its predecessor institutions sent their graduates to universities in these respective countries and also invited lecturers from them. However, by the 1880s, the Japanese government grew concerned over the spread of French republican and British constitutional monarchist ideals among the faculty and students, and eventually Minister of Education Takato Oki instructed the university to reduce the use of English as a language of instruction, and instead to switch to Japanese. This shift coincided with the return of UTokyo alumni who had completed their education in Europe, and these returnees began filling roles that had been predominantly held by foreign scholars.

=== Interwar period ===

The first half of the Interwar period in Japan was characterised by the spread of liberal ideas, collectively known as Taishō Democracy. This movement was ushered in by the concept of &quot;Minpon Shugi&quot; by Sakuzō Yoshino, as well as Tatsukichi Minobe&#x27;s interpretation of sovereignty as inherent to the state rather than the monarchy. Both were alumni and professors at the Faculty of Law. Taking advantage of the widespread acceptance of such ideas, prime minister Takaaki Katō, an alumnus of UTokyo, extended suffrage to all males aged 25 and over in 1925, as promised in his manifesto. This liberal tendency was also shared among students, exemplified by the labour movement organisation the UTokyo Association of New People (東大新人会, ) and the UTokyo Settlement (東大セツルメント, ). However, strong reactions against these liberal and socialist ideas also emerged at the university, notably from Shinkichi Uesugi, who mentored and greatly influenced three future prime ministers among his students at UTokyo: Nobusuke Kishi, Eisaku Satō, and Takeo Fukuda.

==== Great Kanto Earthquake ====

On September 1, 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake struck the Kanto Plain, inflicting immense damage upon the university. This damage included the complete destruction of almost all main buildings, including the library, as well as the loss of precious scientific and historical samples and data stored in them. This led to a university-wide debate as to whether it should relocate to a larger site, such as Yoyogi, but ultimately, such plans were rejected. Instead, the university purchased additional land in its vicinity, which was still owned by the Maeda family, and expanded there.

The reconstruction of the university and its library was brought up in the fourth general assembly of the League of Nations in September 1923, where it was unanimously decided to provide support. The League is said to have been sympathetic especially because the memory of the destruction of KU Leuven in Belgium during the First World War was still fresh. The American philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. personally donated $2 million (approximately $36 million in 2023). The United Kingdom formed a committee led by former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour, and made substantial financial and cultural contributions. Rockefeller Jr. and Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, a younger son of George V, visited the university in 1929, shortly after the new library was completed. Prince Henry&#x27;s visit marked the first Great Ball (大園遊会, &quot;Dai-Enyukai&quot;) in several years, which is now known as the May Festival (五月祭, &quot;Gogatsusai&quot;). A large portion of the buildings on Hongo Campus today were built during this reconstruction period, and their unique Collegiate Gothic style is known as Uchida Gothic () after Yoshikazu Uchida, the architect who designed them.

Another notable change the earthquake brought about at the university was the expansion of its seismology studies. Long having been the only university in the seismically active country, the university was already known for its seismology research, most notably the contributions made by its alumnus and professor, Fusakichi Omori, in quantitatively evaluating the aftershocks of earthquakes (Omori&#x27;s law) and developing a new type of seismometer capable of recording primary waves. The university set up an independent seismology department in November 1923 to delve into the causes and effects of earthquakes and to better prepare for future seismic events. In 1925, with a government grant, the Earthquake Research Institute was established within the university, and it has been in continuous operation up to today.

=== World War II ===

In 1941, the Empire of Japan attacked the American bases at Pearl Harbor and joined the World War II as an Axis power alongside Germany. By late 1943, as Japan faced significant defeats in the Pacific theatre, a decision was made to enlist university students studying humanities, sending them to battlefields. During the war, 1,652 students and alumni of UTokyo were killed, including those from varied civilian professions such as doctors, engineers, and diplomats, as well as those killed in action. They are commemorated in a memorial erected near the front gate of the Hongo Campus. Most students from faculties of engineering and science remained at university or worked as apprentice engineers, as the expertise of science and technology was deemed indispensable for the war effort. Leo Esaki, who was a student at the department of physics during the war, shared his memory of his university life in 2007: &#x27;The day after the Tokyo Air Raid of 9 March 1945, during which more than 100 thousand citizens were killed, professor Tanaka conducted class as usual, without mentioning the war at all&#x27;. The buildings and facilities of UTokyo were largely immune from air raids, allowing education and research activities to continue.

The increased demand brought about by the war for engineers, especially in the fields of aeronautics, machinery, electronics, and shipbuilding, led to the establishment of the Second Faculty of Engineering () at UTokyo in 1942. In the newly built Chiba Campus, around 800 students were enrolled at one time, and military engineering research activities were conducted. It was closed in 1951, and as a successor organisation, the Institute of Industrial Science was established on the site of the former headquarters of the Third Infantry Regiment in Roppongi. During the war, the Imperial Army attempted to use the university&#x27;s facilities several times, including plans to relocate the university to Sendai and use the Hongo Campus as a fortress for the anticipated Allied landing, Operation Downfall, to protect the Imperial Palace. President Yoshikazu Uchida consistently denied these requests by persuading them of the importance of culture, education and research for the country&#x27;s long-term development. In September 1945, efforts by Uchida and Shigeru Nambara, Dean of the Faculty of Law, prevented the campus from becoming the Allied Headquarters. Instead, the Dai-Ichi Seimei Building was chosen. Nambara succeeded Uchida as president in December 1945.

=== Post-war period ===

During the American occupation era following Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the university dropped the word &#x27;imperial&#x27; from its name and reverted to its original name, University of Tokyo. During this period, under American pressure to remove the role pre-war education was believed to have played in sustaining the class structure, Japan&#x27;s education system was reformed. President Nambara was appointed as the chairman of the National Educational Reform Committee and implemented these changes. As a result, UTokyo under merged with two Higher Schools, which were university preparatory boy&#x27;s boarding schools and thus became a four-year university instead of three-year as it is today in 1949. One of the higher schools that merged with UTokyo, the First Higher School, became the College of Arts and Sciences. This new college, operating on the same campus of Komaba as the higher school, took on the responsibility of educating all undergraduates for the first year and a half of their degrees. At the request of SCAP, the Department of Education was separated from the Faculty of Letters to establish the Faculty of Education. It was also during this period that UTokyo first opened its doors to female students. The first nineteen female students were matriculated in April 1946.

==== University of Tokyo Struggles ====
The 1960s saw an intensification of student protests across the world, including the Anti-Vietnam War protests and the May 68 events in France. This zeitgeist of the era was prominently felt in Japan as well, symbolised by the 1960 Anpo protests, in which the death of a UTokyo student, Michiko Kamba, caused public outrage. In 1968, the began with medical students demanding improvements in internship conditions, in which medical students were forced to work long hours without being paid before being licensed as a doctor.

The conflict intensified with the indefinite strike decision by the students in January 1968 and escalated further following a clash between the students and faculty. Tensions peaked when radical students, most of whom were members of the Zenkyōtō (the All-Campus Joint Struggle Committees), occupied Yasuda Auditorium, leading the university to eventually call in riot police in June— a move seen as abandoning university autonomy. Efforts to resolve the situation began with the resignation of university executives and the appointment of Ichiro Kato as interim president, who started negotiations. The conflict largely ended in January 1969 after a full-scale police operation to remove the occupying students. This operation involved more than 8,500 riot police officers confronting students who fought back with Molotov cocktails and marble stones taken from the auditorium&#x27;s interior. Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, who was an alumnus of UTokyo himself, visited the site the day after the protesters in the auditorium were forcibly removed, and decided to cancel that year&#x27;s admission process. This led top highschool students to apply reluctantly to other universities such as Kyoto University and Hitotsubashi University, resulting in many applicants who would have been admitted to those universities under normal circumstances failing to gain admission, since applicants are not allowed to apply to multiple prestigious national universities in Japan. The aftermath saw 633 prosecutions, and varied sentences, marking a turbulent chapter in the university&#x27;s history.

=== 21st century ===

==== Women&#x27;s education ====
The university first admitted female students in 1946. While the student body has remained predominantly male, various attempts have been made to achieve a more equal gender ratio. In 2023, women made up 23 per cent of first-year undergraduates, the highest percentage in the university&#x27;s history. A quarter of graduate students were female in 2022.

==== Reforms in the 21st century ====

When the British magazine Times Higher Education first published its world university rankings in partnership with QS in 2004, the University of Tokyo was ranked 12th in the world. In the latest 2024 edition of the rankings, it is ranked 29th. QS, now with its own rankings, placed the UTokyo at 28th. As these numbers suggest, there is a widely shared concern that the university is falling behind its counterparts in the world, and in the future it may struggle to provide a suitable environment for quality education and world-class research.

UTokyo faces a challenging reality. Japan&#x27;s long-lasting economic downturn since the 1990s has led to Japanese companies less willing to invest in research and development than before. Additionally, the government&#x27;s Management Expense Grant () has been reduced by one per cent annually since 2004. This policy, ostensibly aimed at decreasing the university&#x27;s reliance on the grant and fostering greater independence, has been blamed as one of the main reasons for the decline in the university&#x27;s competitiveness.

To address these challenges, UTokyo has implemented various reforms. In 2004, the University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC) was established. This venture capital firm, affiliated with the university, supports entrepreneurship arising from UTokyo&#x27;s research and development, aiming to drive innovation across society. In 2006, the first phase of development was completed at Kashiwa Campus. Situated in the suburb of Kashiwa, this research-focused campus spans 405,313 square metres (100 acres) and has been at the forefront of advanced scientific research since its inception. In 2010, in an attempt to further internationalise and diversify its student body, the university increased its autumn enrollment opportunities for international students. UTokyo plans to increase the proportion of female faculty members to above a quarter by newly creating positions for 300 female lecturers by 2027. In 2021, the newly elected President Teruo Fujii announced the UTokyo Compass, a guiding framework for the university during his tenure, focusing on diversity, dialogue, and creating a better future. It emphasises the university&#x27;s autonomy and creativity in a new era, advocating multifaceted perspectives on knowledge, people, and places. The Compass encourages dialogue throughout the university and society as a pivotal tool for understanding and questioning, fostering inclusivity, and tackling global challenges. In his announcement, he pledged to make UTokyo &#x27;a university that anyone in the world would like to join&#x27;.

== Student life ==

=== Admissions ===

The (東大入試, &quot;todai nyushi&quot;) is regarded as the most selective in Japan and is almost synonymous with something that is difficult to achieve. To apply, candidates must achieve high scores in the Common Test for University Admissions, a standardised multiple-choice examination. UTokyo applicants are required to take at least seven subjects in this examination. Applicants for natural sciences take two mathematics tests, Japanese (which consists of modern language, classics, and Chinese classics), one foreign language, sciences (two from physics, chemistry, biology, and geology), and one social study subject chosen from geography, Japanese history, or world history. Humanities candidates take two social studies subjects and one science subject instead.

Based on the scores from the Common Test, approximately three times the number of the final admission slots are invited to take the main examination in late February. Based on the idea that regardless of the field of specialisation, all students should have a solid understanding of mathematics and a good command of languages, mathematics, Japanese and one foreign language are compulsory for all applicants. For this examination, science candidates are tested in Advanced Mathematics, English, Japanese, and two science subjects. Humanities candidates take Mathematics, a foreign language, Advanced Japanese, and two social studies subjects (options are geography, Japanese history and world history). UTokyo is also known to be the only university that requires all applicants, including those who wish to study natural sciences, to take a non-multiple-choice Japanese and Chinese classics exam. Some applicants are called upon to take an interview.

Successful candidates are notified in March of the same year and are matriculated in April. The official acceptance rates for undergraduate degrees are relatively high, at around 30 per cent, which is due to the policy of restricting the number of students who can sit for the exam based on the scores from the Common Test. Additionally, Japan&#x27;s university admission policy does not allow applicants to apply to multiple prestigious national universities, hence non-prospective students tend to switch to other national universities where they are more likely to secure admission.

=== Junior division ===

The matriculation ceremony takes place on April 12, the foundation day of the university. All first-year students are matriculated at the College of Arts and Sciences at Komaba, which is a remnant of the time when the Komaba Campus served as the separate boarding school known as the First Higher School until 1949. There, they spend the first one and a half years of their degrees. Students are required to study a foreign language they have never learnt for at least a year, with classes formed based on their choices. Popular languages include Chinese, French, German, Korean, Spanish, and Russian. These classes are meant to be places where students can interact with peers from different backgrounds and forge long-lasting friendships, especially because they spend a considerable amount of time together. There is a tradition where the previous year&#x27;s class (, &quot;uekura&quot;) invites the juniors to overnight orientation camps (, &quot;ori gasshuku&quot;) in early April.

Intense academic competition is common among students in the junior division, as they face matriculation to the senior division (, &quot;shingaku sentaku&quot;, or colloquially , &quot;shinfuri&quot;) in September of their second year, where they are assigned to departments based on their grades for the first one and a half years at Komaba. The Department of Information Science, the Faculty of Medicine, and the Department of Sociology are amongst the most selective departments in the &quot;shingaku sentaku&quot;.

==== Student housing ====
Despite its roots as a boarding school, most undergraduates at the university either live with their families at home or in non-university accommodation. Since the closure of the (駒場寮, &quot;Komaba-ryo&quot;) in August 2001, there has been no on-campus accommodation for domestic students at the university. There are four university dormitories available for undergraduate students: Mitaka, Toshima, Oiwake and Mejirodai. In 2021, approximately five per cent of the undergraduate students lived in one of the university dormitories. The university offers more options for international students, with on-campus dormitories available for them at Komaba and Kashiwa.

==== Student newspapers and magazines ====
&quot;The Todai Shimbun&quot; (東大新聞) is the oldest university newspaper still in operation, with its first issue in 1920. The editing committee of the newspaper has produced multiple central figures in the country&#x27;s publishing industry. Recruit, a human resources company with the 13th largest market capitalisation among all publicly traded companies in the country as of March 2024, spun off from &quot;the Todai Shimbun&quot;&#x27;s advertisement branch in 1961. There are several other newer campus newspapers and magazines, the most notable of which is &quot;the Kokasha&quot; (). &quot;The Kokasha&quot;&#x27;s start-of-term issues include evaluations of lecturers by students from the previous year, and are widely read by students in the junior division to decide which modules to take at the beginning of terms. Additionally, there are several other relatively new student magazines, such as the biscUiT, &quot;the Todai Shimpo&quot; and &quot;the Komaba Times&quot;. Apart from those, student web media such as &quot;the UT-base&quot; and &quot;the UmeeT&quot; are widely read by students.

=== Senior division ===

After completing the &quot;Shingaku Sentaku&quot;, second-year students matriculate into senior division departments to specialise in their chosen fields. With the exception of the senior division of the College of Arts and Sciences and the Department of Mathematics, which are located in Komaba, all other senior departments are situated in Hongo. Consequently, approximately 85 per cent of the students start a new chapter of their university life there.

The Hongo Campus is located closer to the centre of Tokyo, and has more restaurants, cafes, and large museums in the vicinity compared to Komaba. In addition to these, the campus itself has fifteen refectories and restaurants, nine cafes, nine convenience stores and kiosks, one bookshop, two barbershops, and an underground gym with two 25-metre pools.
Graduation ceremonies take place towards the end of March. Approximately one-third of the graduates enter the workforce upon graduation, while the remainder continue their studies at graduate schools within the university or at universities abroad. Popular places of employment for UTokyo graduates include the university itself, government ministries, global conglomerates such as Sony and Hitachi, consulting firms such as McKinsey &amp; Company and PwC Consulting, trading companies such as Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui Corp, and investment banks.

=== International education ===
As of November 1, 2023, the University of Tokyo hosts 5,106 international students, who represent 17.7 per cent of the total student body. Of these, 4,874 are postgraduate students and 460 are undergraduates. Exchange students and postdoctoral researchers are not included in these numbers.

At the undergraduate level, there are mainly three routes for those who have not received their secondary education in Japanese to apply to the University of Tokyo. First, individuals with high Japanese proficiency can apply through the special admissions process for students educated overseas (). Students admitted via this route study alongside their peers who received secondary education in Japanese. International students who apply via this route sometimes spend a year studying the language at preparatory schools before matriculation. Second, there are undergraduate programmes called PEAK (Programs in English at Komaba), which accept applications based on international qualifications such as the A-level, SAT, and International Baccalaureate. All modules in these programmes are taught in English. However, learning Japanese is mandatory, and those confident in their Japanese ability can take modules taught in Japanese in other departments. Third, the university offers exchange programmes with universities worldwide. There are University-wide Student Exchange Programmes (USTEP) with universities such as Tsinghua University, Princeton University, National University of Singapore and Yale University. The College of Arts and Sciences has its own exchange programmes called KOMSTEP with universities such as University of Paris. The Faculty of Engineering also has its own exchange programmes, whose partner institutions include Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi, University of Cambridge, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Starting in Autumn 2027, UTokyo plans to offer a five-year programme called the College of Design. The programme aims to &#x27;redefine design as a broad concept (...) based on interdisciplinary knowledge that integrates the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, engineering and other fields&#x27;. Approximately 100 students will be matriculated annually, with half of them coming from overseas.

A wider variety of postgraduate programmes are offered in English, making the international student ratio significantly higher for postgraduate studies (31.32 per cent in November 2023).

== Organisation ==

The University of Tokyo operates under a centralised administrative structure, with key policies set by the administrative council, which is chaired by the president. However, due to the university&#x27;s historical development as a merger of various institutions, each of the constituent colleges, faculties, and research institutes maintains its own administrative board. Today, the University of Tokyo is organised into 10 faculties and 15 graduate schools.

The leader of the University of Tokyo is known as the and it is a substantive leadership role. The president is elected by the university&#x27;s board council from among the faculty members for a term of six years. The current president is Teruo Fujii, a scholar in applied microfluidics, who assumed the role in April 2021 and is expected to serve until March 2027.

=== Faculties and graduate schools ===
The University of Tokyo&#x27;s academic structure consists of 10 faculties and their affiliated graduate schools. This organisational structure was introduced as a result of reforms in the 1990s.

In addition to the graduate schools affiliated with specific faculties, the University of Tokyo also includes two independent graduate institutions: the Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies and the Graduate School of Public Policy (GraSPP).

=== Research institutes ===
Apart from the faculties and graduate schools, the University of Tokyo hosts eleven . Simultaneously, they function as educational institutions for the graduate schools.
=== UTokyo Institutes For Advanced Study (UTIAS) ===
UTokyo Institutes For Advanced Study (UTIAS) started in January 2011. Their primary objective is to improve academic excellence and foster an internationalised research environment. There are four UTIAS institutes as of November 2023:
=== University of Tokyo library system ===
The University of Tokyo Library System consists of three comprehensive libraries located on the main campuses—Hongo, Komaba, and Kashiwa—along with 27 other field-specific libraries operated by various faculties and research institutes. As of 2024, the University of Tokyo library has a collection of over 10 million books and numerous materials of historical importance. This collection ranks it as the second-largest library in Japan, surpassed only by the National Diet Library, which holds a collection of approximately 46.8 million books. It also subscribes to about 170,000 journals.

The headquarters of the library is situated in the General Library at Hongo, which underwent thorough renovation in the late 2010s. It now features a 46-metre-deep automated underground storage capable of housing approximately 3 million books.

=== University of Tokyo Hospital ===
The University of Tokyo Hospital is an academic health science centre operated by the Faculty of Medicine. The hospital finds its roots in the Kanda Otamagaike Vaccination Centre, established in 1858. It has 37 clinical examination rooms for a wide range of specialisations including Cardiovascular Medicine and Orthopaedic Surgery, among others. With a capacity of 1,210 beds, the hospital facilitated medical services for 389,830 inpatients and 794,454 outpatients in the fiscal year 2010. Newsweek&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Best Hospitals 2023&quot; ranks it 17th in the world, 2nd in Asia, and 1st in Japan. It serves as the primary hospital for the Imperial Family of Japan, with both the current emperor and the emperor emeritus having undergone major operations there.

=== Museums ===
The University of Tokyo operates eight museums, three of which fall under the purview of the University Museum (UMUT).

Apart from the aforementioned museums, the University of Tokyo operates several other public facilities, the most notable of which are two botanical gardens managed by the Faculty of Science: Koishikawa and Nikko.
=== Finances ===

In 2021-2022, the university had an income of 264.1 billion yen. Of this, 93.4 billion yen (35.1%) was funded by the government, primarily through the Expense Management Grant (運営費交付金). Despite being a national university, this grant from the government has been consistently reduced, dropping from 95.5 billion yen in 2005 to 79.9 billion yen in 2022. A total of 81.2 billion yen (30.5%) was self-earned, through sources such as the university hospitals (54.7 billion yen) and academic fees (16.6 billion yen). The remainder, 91.7 billion yen (34.4%), came from external funding, such as research grants and endowments. Although research grants are primarily earned by research groups and not by the university, the university can typically claim up to 30% of them for university operations, which is included in this number.

The total assets of the university are valued at 1.47 trillion yen as of March 31, 2024. Land holdings make up the largest percentage of this figure, valued at 878 billion yen. UTokyo&#x27;s endowment fund is relatively small, at 44 billion yen as of March 2023. This is because national universities in Japan, including UTokyo, were not allowed to invest in high-risk assets until 2018, so endowments were spent rather than invested until that point. The UTokyo Foundation is the primary fundraising arm of the university, and it accepts both endowments for the university as a whole and purpose-specific donations.

UTokyo&#x27;s tuition fees have been fixed at 535,000 yen annually for undergraduates and master&#x27;s students since 2005, regardless of their status (whether domestic or international). This makes up approximately 5% of the university&#x27;s income. However, the decline in government funding and the university&#x27;s international standing have brought about discussions on whether to raise these fees. 

== Notable research ==
Since its foundation in 1877, the University of Tokyo has been involved in a wide range of research across various disciplines. Below is a selection of recognised research efforts conducted by individuals and teams affiliated with the university during their work.

* In 1904, Hantaro Nagaoka, an alumnus and professor in the Department of Physics, devised the Saturnian model of the atom. Contrasting with J. J. Thomson&#x27;s then-popular plum pudding model, Nagaoka&#x27;s model proposed an atomic structure with a heavy nucleus at the centre and electrons revolving around it. Although this model assumed a far larger nucleus than in reality, it inspired Ernest Rutherford&#x27;s Rutherford model.
* Teiji Takagi, an alumnus and professor of the Department of Mathematics, proved the Takagi existence theorem in the 1910s. Alongside significant contributions to algebraic number theory, he also introduced the Blancmange curve, a well-known example of a self-affine curve.
* In 1951, Kiyoshi Ito, as a doctoral student in the Department of Mathematics, pioneered the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic differential equations, now known as Itô calculus. This theory is best known for its application in mathematical finance, namely in the Black–Scholes equation for option values.
* On February 11, 1970, a team at the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science of the University of Tokyo succeeded in launching the country&#x27;s first satellite, Ohsumi, making the country the fourth nation in the world to have the capability to send objects into orbit with their own launch vehicles. The satellite was carried on a Lambda 4S rocket, a joint project by the Institute of Industrial Science at the university and Nissan. The second satellite of the country, Tansei, was named after the school colour of the university (light blue). The institute left the purview of the university as part of a government-led project in the 1980s and eventually formed JAXA, but it still operates in close liaison with the university.
* Yoshinori Ohsumi made a breakthrough in the study of autophagy, a process for cellular waste management and recycling, when he was a professor at the College of Arts and Sciences at the university. Using yeast for his experiments, Ohsumi identified key genes involved in autophagy, shedding light on how cells respond to stress such as malnutrition and infections, and linking the process to various diseases including cancer. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2016 &#x27;for his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy&#x27;.
* On February 23, 1987, the Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment observatory, part of the Department of Physics, detected cosmic neutrinos for the first time in human history. This discovery significantly contributed to proving that the sun&#x27;s energy is generated from hydrogen atoms combining into helium(proton-proton reaction chain). Masatoshi Koshiba, leader of this research group, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. In 1998, an expanded version of this neutrino observatory (Super-Kamiokande) detected neutrino oscillation, demonstrating that the &#x27;lepton flavour&#x27; of neutrinos changes. This discovery, proving that neutrinos have mass, led to Takaaki Kajita receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015. As the successor to Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande is currently under construction, with the operation&#x27;s start planned for 2027.

==Academic rankings and reputation==
Due to its age and its academic and social status, the University of Tokyo is considered to be the most prestigious university in Japan, and reflecting this, its admission process for undergraduate degrees is regarded as the most selective in the country.

* The &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; ranked UTokyo 28th in the world in 2024 (1st in Japan). Its subject rankings ranked UTokyo 1st in the country for all subjects it covers. The &quot;Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings&quot; 2023 ranked UTokyo 10th in the world (1st in Japan, 2nd in Asia). In 2017, its &quot;Alma Mater Index&quot;, which measures universities around the world by the number of CEOs of &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500 companies among their alumni, ranked UTokyo 16th in the world.
* The &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; ranked UTokyo 28th in the world in 2023 (1st in Japan). Its subject rankings ranked UTokyo 1st in Japan for all academic disciplines the university covers except for Classics and Ancient History, for which KyotoU was recognised as the best. The university was ranked 11th in the world for Natural Sciences, 18th for Engineering and Technology, 35th for Social Sciences &amp; Management, and 32nd for Arts and Humanities.

* UTokyo has consistently been the largest recipient of the KAKENHI Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Japan&#x27;s largest national research grant) in the country. In FY2022, it alone received approximately 10 percent of the total grants awarded to 1,370 institutions across Japan.
* In 2023, &quot;Newsweek&quot; recognised the University of Tokyo Hospital as the 17th best hospital in the world (2nd in Asia after Singapore General Hospital, 1st in Japan).

=== Subject rankings ===


==Sites==
Apart from the three main campuses, the University of Tokyo operates a large number of other campuses and facilities globally. The university&#x27;s land holdings in Japan amount to 326 square kilometres. As of 31 March 2023, the university&#x27;s real estate holdings are valued at 1.14 trillion yen.

=== Hongo campus ===

The Hongo campus has been the university&#x27;s centre since 1884, when the university&#x27;s administration office relocated to the site. The campus faces Shinobazu Pond in Ueno Park to the east and has in its vicinity the electric district Akihabara, the city&#x27;s bookshop hub, Jimbōchō, and the city&#x27;s largest indoor stadium, Tokyo Dome. The campus is served by three Tokyo Metro stations: Hongo-sanchome, Todai-mae, and Nezu. It occupies the former estate of the Maeda family, Edo period feudal lords of Kaga Province. One of the university&#x27;s best known landmarks, Akamon (the Red Gate), is a relic of this era. The symbol of the university is the ginkgo leaf, from the trees found throughout the area. The Hongo campus also hosts UTokyo&#x27;s annual May Festival.

===Komaba Campus===
The Komaba Campus, serving as the educational hub for the first two years of undergraduate studies, provides general education to around 6,000 first and second year students. The campus, also home to the Graduate Schools of Arts, Sciences, and Mathematical Sciences, has advanced research facilities. It also provides specialised education for about 450 senior division undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences and 1,400 graduate students across various disciplines. It is served by Komaba-Todaimae Station on the Keio Inokashira line, which is directly connected to the main gate of the campus.

===Kashiwa Campus===
The Kashiwa Campus specialises in postgraduate education and research. It houses the Graduate School of Frontier Sciences along with advanced research institutes such as the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, the Institute for Solid State Physics, the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, and the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, equipped with extensive facilities and services.

===Shirokanedai Campus===

The relatively small Shirokanedai Campus hosts the Institute of Medical Science, which is entirely dedicated to postgraduate studies. The institute was originally established by Shibasaburo Kitasato and moved to the current site in Shirokanedai, Minato in 1906. The campus is focused on genome research, including among its research groups the Human Genome Center, which has at its disposal the largest supercomputer in the field. The main building of the building was designed by Yoshikazu Uchida in a style matching that of the adjacent Institute of Public Health, which is now opened to the public as Minato Local History Museum.

== Notable alumni ==
Throughout its history as a modern university since 1877, a considerable number of UTokyo alumni have become notable in various fields, both academic and otherwise. As of 2024, UTokyo&#x27;s alumni and faculty include 17 prime ministers of Japan out of 64, 20 Nobel Prize laureates, five astronauts, and a Fields Medalist. Additionally, UTokyo alumni have founded some of Japan&#x27;s largest companies, such as Toyota and Hitachi. UTokyo alumni also hold chief executive positions in approximately a quarter of the Nikkei 225 companies (47 in 2014), a fifth of the total seats in the National Diet (139 out of 713 in 2023), more than half of the prefectual governorships (27 out of 47 in 2023), and about two thirds of the justiceships at the Supreme Court of Japan (11 out of 15 in 2024).

Of the 20 Nobel Prize winners affiliated with UTokyo in some way, a total of twelve have earned degrees from the institution, with prizes won in five of the six categories, except for economics. This is the largest number among all universities in Asia. However, when including other affiliates such as non-alumnus faculty members, the total number is on a par with Kyoto University. The remainder consists of: Hideki Yukawa (Physics, 1949), who served as a professor from 1942 for a few years; Charles H. Townes (Physics, 1964), who was a visiting scholar for two years in the 1950s; Wolfgang Paul (Physics, 1989), who was a visiting lecturer in 1978; Anthony James Leggett (Physics, 2003), who was a visiting professor for two years beginning in 1972; Gérard Mourou, who was a visiting professor in 1994; Tasuku Honjo (Physiology or Medicine, 2018), who was an assistant professor for six years beginning in 1974; Harry Markowitz (Economics, 1990) and Leonid Hurwicz (Economics, 2007), both of whom served as visiting professors.

=== Other notable alumni and affiliates ===
Masako, Empress of Japan, attended UTokyo after finishing her first degree overseas, although she did not earn a degree from the university. The university&#x27;s other recent connections with the Imperial family include Takahito, Prince Mikasa, younger brother of Emperor Hirohito, who studied archaeology; Fujimaro, Marquess of Tsukuba, a younger son of Kikumaro, Prince Yamashina, who studied Japanese literature. Additionally, Crown Prince Fumihito, and his daughter Princess Mako both worked at the University Museum at different times. King Birendra of Nepal also attended UTokyo but did not earn a degree. UTokyo was a preferred educational institution for members of the Japanese aristocracy before any form of peerage, with the exception of the Imperial family, was prohibited with the 1947 constitution. Duke Iemasa Tokugawa, 17th head of the House of Tokugawa, studied law at the university and led a career as a diplomat. Other members of the clan who attended the university include Marquess Yoshichika Tokugawa, who became active as a botanist and patron of arts and sciences later in his life, and Earl Muneyoshi Tokugawa, who was the primary promoter of forestation movements in Japan. Earl Yoriyasu Arima studied agriculture and later served as the Minister of Agriculture. The &quot;Arima Kinen&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest betting horse race, was named in his honour. Marquess Yoshi Hijikata, with his strong communist sympathies, fled to Soviet Russia and was deprived of his title on account of this. Another communist sympathiser among UTokyo&#x27;s alumni, Hotsumi Ozaki, played a central role in Soviet espionage with Richard Sorge and was executed for high treason in 1944.

Chie Nakane, a social anthropologist, was one of the first nineteen female students matriculated at UTokyo in 1947, and she later became the first female professor in the university&#x27;s history. Hidesaburo Ueno, an agricultural scientist who studied and worked at the Faculty of Agriculture, is best known as the owner of the devoted dog Hachiko, who continued to wait for him for more than 9 years. Although the university is not particularly noted for athletics today, beginning with Yahiko Mishima, the first-ever Japanese Olympian who competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics, 33 UTokyo students and alumni have competed in the Olympics. Kusuo Kitamura, later a senior bureaucrat at the Ministry of Labour, won a gold medal in the Men&#x27;s 1500 metre freestyle swimming in the 1932 Summer Olympics. Judo, now an Olympic sport, was created by Jigoro Kano in 1882, the year he graduated from UTokyo. He was also the central figure in Japan&#x27;s successful bid to host the 1940 Summer Olympic Games, which had to be cancelled due to the Second World War.

<doc id="166223" wikidata="Q267605" url="?curid=166223" title="Herman Kahn">
<text>Herman Kahn (February 15, 1922 – July 7, 1983) was an American physicist and a founding member of the Hudson Institute, regarded as one of the preeminent futurists of the latter part of the twentieth century. He originally came to prominence as a military strategist and systems theorist while employed at the RAND Corporation. He analyzed the likely consequences of nuclear war and recommended ways to improve survivability during the Cold War. Kahn posited the idea of a &quot;winnable&quot; nuclear exchange in his 1960 book &quot;On Thermonuclear War&quot; for which he was one of the historical inspirations for the title character of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s classic black comedy film satire &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. In his commentary for &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, director Sidney Lumet remarked that the Professor Groeteschele character is also based on Herman Kahn.
Kahn&#x27;s theories contributed to the development of the nuclear strategy of the United States.

== Early life and education ==

Kahn was born in Bayonne, New Jersey, as one of three sons to Yetta (née Koslowsky) and Abraham Kahn, a tailor. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland. He was raised in the Bronx, then in Los Angeles following his parents&#x27; divorce in 1932. Raised Jewish, he later identified as an atheist. Kahn graduated from Fairfax High School in 1940 and enlisted in the United States Army in May 1943, serving during the Burma campaign in World War II in a non-combat capacity as a telephone lineman. He received a Bachelor of Science at UCLA and briefly attended Caltech to pursue a doctorate before dropping out with a Master of Science due to financial constraints. He joined the RAND Corporation as a mathematician after being recruited by fellow physicist Samuel Cohen.

== Cold War theories ==

Kahn&#x27;s major contributions were the several strategies he developed during the Cold War to contemplate &quot;the unthinkable&quot;namely, nuclear warfareby using applications of game theory. Kahn is often cited (with Pierre Wack) as a father of scenario planning.

Kahn argued for deterrence and believed that if the Soviet Union believed that the United States had a second strike capability then it would offer greater deterrence, which he wrote in his paper titled &quot;The Nature and Feasibility of War and Deterrence&quot;.

The bases of his work were systems theory and game theory as applied to economics and military strategy. Kahn argued that for deterrence to succeed, the Soviet Union had to be convinced that the United States had second-strike capability in order to leave the Politburo in no doubt that even a perfectly coordinated massive attack would guarantee a measure of retaliation that would leave them devastated as well:

In 1962, Kahn published a 16-step escalation ladder. By 1965 he had developed this into a 44-step ladder.

== Hudson Institute ==

In 1961, Kahn, Max Singer and Oscar Ruebhausen founded the Hudson Institute, a think tank initially located in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, where Kahn was living at the time. He recruited sociologist Daniel Bell, political philosopher Raymond Aron and novelist Ralph Ellison (author of the 1952 classic &quot;Invisible Man&quot;).

== &quot;The Year 2000&quot; ==

In 1967, Herman Kahn and Anthony J. Wiener published &quot;The Year 2000: A Framework for Speculation on the Next Thirty-Three Years&quot;, which included contributions from staff members of the Hudson Institute and an introduction by Daniel Bell. Table XVIII in the document contains a list called &quot;One Hundred Technical Innovations Very Likely in the Last Third of the Twentieth Century&quot;. The first ten predictions were:
# Multiple applications of lasers
# Extreme high-strength structural materials
# New or improved superperformance fabrics
# New or improved materials for equipment and appliances
# New airborne vehicles (ground-effect vehicles, giant or supersonic jets, VTOL, STOL)
# Extensive commercial applications of shaped-charge explosives
# More reliable and longer-range weather forecasting
# Extensive and/or intensive expansion of tropical agriculture and forestry
# New sources of power for fixed installations
# New sources of power for ground transportation

== Later years ==

In Kahn&#x27;s view, capitalism and technology held nearly boundless potential for progress, while the colonization of space lay in the near, not the distant, future. Kahn&#x27;s 1976 book &quot;The Next 200 Years&quot;, written with William Brown and Leon Martel, presented an optimistic scenario of economic conditions in the year 2176. He also wrote a number of books extrapolating the future of the American, Japanese and Australian economies and several works on systems theory, including the well-received 1957 monograph &quot;Techniques of System Analysis&quot;.

In 1970, Kahn published the book &quot;The Emerging Japanese Superstate&quot; in which he claimed that Japan would play a large role in the world equal to the Soviet Union and the United States. In the book, he claimed that Japan would pursue obtaining nuclear weapons and that it would pass the United States in per-capita income by 1990, and likely equal it in gross national product by 2000. During the mid-1970s, when South Korea&#x27;s GDP per capita was one of the lowest in the world, Kahn predicted that the country would become one of the top 10 most powerful countries in the world by the year 2000.

In his last year, 1983, Kahn wrote approvingly of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s political agenda in &quot;The Coming Boom: Economic, Political, and Social&quot; and bluntly derided Jonathan Schell&#x27;s claims about the long-term effects of nuclear war. On July 7 that year, he died of a stroke, aged 61.
==Personal life==
His wife was Rosalie &quot;Jane&quot; Kahn. He and Jane had two children, David and Debbie.

== Cultural influence ==

Along with John von Neumann, Edward Teller and Wernher von Braun, Kahn was an inspiration for the character &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; in the eponymous film by Stanley Kubrick released in 1964. After Kubrick read Kahn&#x27;s book &quot;On Thermonuclear War&quot;, he began a correspondence with him which led to face-to-face discussions between Kubrick and Kahn. In the film, Dr. Strangelove refers to a report on the Doomsday Machine by the &quot;BLAND Corporation&quot;, a parody of the RAND Corporation. Kahn gave Kubrick the idea for the &quot;Doomsday Machine&quot;, a device which would immediately cause the destruction of the entire planet in the event of a nuclear attack. Both the name and the concept of the weapon are drawn from the text of &quot;On Thermonuclear War&quot;. Louis Menand observes, &quot;In Kahn&#x27;s book, the Doomsday Machine is an example of the sort of deterrent that appeals to the military mind but that is dangerously destabilizing. Since nations are not suicidal, its only use is to threaten.&quot;

Kahn also inspired the character of Professor Groeteschele (Walter Matthau) in the 1964 film &quot;Fail Safe&quot;.

<text>Orioles are colourful Old World passerine birds in the genus Oriolus, the type genus of the corvoidean family Oriolidae. They are not closely related to the New World orioles, which are icterids (family Icteridae) that belong to the superfamily Passeroidea.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Oriolus&quot; was erected in 1766 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the 12th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The type species is, by tautonomy, &quot;Oriolus galbula&quot; Linnaeus, 1766. This is a junior synonym of &quot;Coracias oriolus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, the Eurasian golden oriole. In 1760, French ornithologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; used &quot;Oriolus&quot; as a subdivision of the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;, but the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled in 1955 that &quot;&quot;Oriolus&quot; Brisson, 1760&quot; should be suppressed. Linnaeus added more than a dozen additional genera when he updated his 10th edition, but he generally based new genera on those that had been introduced by Brisson in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot;. &quot;Oriolus&quot; is now the only genus for which Linnaeus&#x27;s 12th edition is cited as the original publication. The name is derived from the old French word &quot;oriol&quot;, which is echoic in origin, derived from the call of the bird, but some authors have suggested origins in classical Latin &quot;aureolus&quot; meaning &quot;golden&quot;. Various forms of &quot;oriole&quot; have existed in Romance languages since the 12th and 13th centuries.

===Extant species===
The genus contains 32 species:

=== Former species ===
Formerly, some authorities also considered these species (or subspecies) as species within the genus &quot;Oriolus:&quot;
* Green figbird (as&quot; Oriolus viridis&quot;)
* Brown-eared bulbul (squamiceps) (as&quot; Oriolus squamiceps&quot;)

==Distribution and habitat==
The orioles are a mainly tropical group, although one species, the Eurasian golden oriole, breeds in temperate regions.
