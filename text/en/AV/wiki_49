<text>In social psychology, an interpersonal relation (or interpersonal relationship) describes a social association, connection, or affiliation between two or more persons. It overlaps significantly with the concept of social relations, which are the fundamental unit of analysis within the social sciences. Relations vary in degrees of intimacy, self-disclosure, duration, reciprocity, and power distribution. The main themes or trends of the interpersonal relations are: family, kinship, friendship, love, marriage, business, employment, clubs, neighborhoods, ethical values, support and solidarity. Interpersonal relations may be regulated by law, custom, or mutual agreement, and form the basis of social groups and societies. They appear when people communicate or act with each other within specific social contexts, and they thrive on equitable and reciprocal compromises.

Interdisciplinary analysis of relationships draws heavily upon the other social sciences, including, but not limited to: anthropology, communication, cultural studies, economics, linguistics, mathematics, political science, social work, and sociology. This scientific analysis had evolved during the 1990s and has become &quot;relationship science&quot;, through the research done by Ellen Berscheid and Elaine Hatfield. This interdisciplinary science attempts to provide evidence-based conclusions through the use of data analysis.

== Types ==
=== Intimate relationships ===
==== Romantic relationships ====
Romantic relationships have been defined in countless ways, by writers, philosophers, religions, scientists, and in the modern day, relationship counselors. Two popular definitions of love are Sternberg&#x27;s Triangular Theory of Love and Fisher&#x27;s theory of love. Sternberg defines love in terms of intimacy, passion, and commitment, which he claims exist in varying levels in different romantic relationships. Fisher defines love as composed of three stages: attraction, romantic love, and attachment. Romantic relationships may exist between two people of any gender, or among a group of people, as in polyamory.
&lt;section begin=&quot;relationship types&quot; /&gt;On the basis of openness, all romantic relationships are of 2 types: open and closed. Closed relationships are strictly against romantic or sexual activity of partners with anyone else outside the relationships. In an open relationship, all partners remain committed to each other, but allow themselves and their partner to have relationships with others.

On the basis of number of partners, they are of 2 types: monoamorous and polyamorous. A monoamorous relationship is between only two individuals. A polyamorous relationship is among three or more individuals.&lt;section end=&quot;relationship types&quot; /&gt;

==== Romance ====

While many individuals recognize the single defining quality of a romantic relationship as the presence of love, it is impossible for romantic relationships to survive without the component of interpersonal communication. Within romantic relationships, love is therefore equally difficult to define. Hazan and Shaver define love, using Ainsworth&#x27;s attachment theory, as comprising proximity, emotional support, self-exploration, and separation distress when parted from the loved one. Other components commonly agreed to be necessary for love are physical attraction, similarity, reciprocity, and self-disclosure.

==== Life stages ====
Early adolescent relationships are characterized by companionship, reciprocity, and sexual experiences. As emerging adults mature, they begin to develop attachment and caring qualities in their relationships, including love, bonding, security, and support for partners. Earlier relationships also tend to be shorter and exhibit greater involvement with social networks. Later relationships are often marked by shrinking social networks, as the couple dedicates more time to each other than to associates. Later relationships also tend to exhibit higher levels of commitment.

Most psychologists and relationship counselors predict a decline of intimacy and passion over time, replaced by a greater emphasis on companionate love (differing from adolescent companionate love in the caring, committed, and partner-focused qualities). However, couple studies have found no decline in intimacy nor in the importance of sex, intimacy, and passionate love to those in longer or later-life relationships. Older people tend to be more satisfied in their relationships, but face greater barriers to entering new relationships than do younger or middle-aged people. Older women in particular face social, demographic, and personal barriers; men aged 65 and older are nearly twice as likely as women to be married, and widowers are nearly three times as likely to be dating 18 months following their partner&#x27;s loss compared to widows.

==== Significant other ====
The term &quot;significant other&quot; gained popularity during the 1990s, reflecting the growing acceptance of &#x27;non-heteronormative&#x27; relationships. It can be used to avoid making an assumption about the gender or relational status (e.g. married, cohabitating, civil union) of a person&#x27;s intimate partner. Cohabiting relationships continue to rise, with many partners considering cohabitation to be nearly as serious as, or a substitute for, marriage. In particular, LGBTQ+ people often face unique challenges in establishing and maintaining intimate relationships. The strain of internalized discrimination, socially ingrained or homophobia, transphobia and other forms of discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, and social pressure of presenting themselves in line with socially acceptable gender norms can affect their health, quality of life, satisfaction, emotions etc. inside and outside their relationships. LGBTQ+ youth also lack the social support and peer connections enjoyed by hetero-normative young people. Nonetheless, comparative studies of homosexual and heterosexual couples have found few differences in relationship intensity, quality, satisfaction, or commitment.

==== Marital relationship ====
Although nontraditional relationships continue to rise, marriage still makes up the majority of relationships except among emerging adults. It is also still considered by many to occupy a place of greater importance among family and social structures.

=== Family relationships ===

==== Parentchild ====
In ancient times, parentchild relationships were often marked by fear, either of rebellion or abandonment, resulting in the strict filial roles in, for example, ancient Rome and China. Freud conceived of the Oedipal complex, the supposed obsession that young boys have towards their mothers and the accompanying fear and rivalry with their fathers, and the Electra complex, in which the young girl feels that her mother has castrated her and therefore becomes obsessed with her father. Freud&#x27;s ideas influenced thought on parentchild relationships for decades.

Another early conception of parent–child relationships was that love only existed as a biological drive for survival and comfort on the child&#x27;s part. In 1958, however, Harry Harlow&#x27;s study &quot; The Hot Wire Mother&quot; comparing rhesus&#x27; reactions to wire surrogate &quot;mothers&quot; and cloth &quot;mothers&quot; demonstrated that affection was wanted by any caregiver and not only the surrogate mothers.

The study laid the groundwork for Mary Ainsworth&#x27;s attachment theory, showing how the infants used their cloth &quot;mothers&quot; as a secure base from which to explore. In a series of studies using the &quot;strange situation&quot;, a scenario in which an infant is separated from then reunited with the parent, Ainsworth defined three styles of parent-child relationship.
* Securely attached infants miss the parent, greet them happily upon return, and show normal exploration and lack of fear when the parent is present.
* Insecure avoidant infants show little distress upon separation and ignore the caregiver when they return. They explore little when the parent is present. Infants also tend to be emotionally unavailable.
* Insecure ambivalent infants are highly distressed by separation, but continue to be distressed upon the parent&#x27;s return; these infants also explore little and display fear even when the parent is present.
* Some psychologists have suggested a fourth attachment style, disorganized, so called because the infants&#x27; behavior appeared disorganized or disoriented.

Secure attachments are linked to better social and academic outcomes and greater moral internalization as research proposes the idea that parent-child relationships play a key role in the developing morality of young children. Secure attachments are also linked to less delinquency for children, and have been found to predict later relationship success.

For most of the late nineteenth through the twentieth century, the perception of adolescent-parent relationships was that of a time of upheaval. G. Stanley Hall popularized the &quot;Sturm und drang&quot;, or storm and stress, model of adolescence. Psychological research has painted a much tamer picture. Although adolescents are more risk-seeking and emerging adults have higher suicide rates, they are largely less volatile and have much better relationships with their parents than the storm and stress model would suggest Early adolescence often marks a decline in parent-child relationship quality, which then re-stabilizes through adolescence, and relationships are sometimes better in late adolescence than prior to its onset. With the increasing average age at marriage and more youths attending college and living with parents past their teens, the concept of a new period called emerging adulthood gained popularity. This is considered a period of uncertainty and experimentation between adolescence and adulthood. During this stage, interpersonal relationships are considered to be more self-focused, and relationships with parents may still be influential.

==== Siblings ====
Sibling relationships have a profound effect on social, psychological, emotional, and academic outcomes. Although proximity and contact usually decreases over time, sibling bonds continue to have effect throughout their lives. Sibling bonds are one of few enduring relationships humans may experience. Sibling relationships are affected by parent-child relationships, such that sibling relationships in childhood often reflect the positive or negative aspects of children&#x27;s relationships with their parents.

===Other examples of interpersonal relationship===
* Egalitarian and platonic friendship
* Enemy
* Frenemy — a person with whom an individual maintains a friendly interaction despite underlying conflict, possibly encompassing rivalry, mistrust, jealousy or competition
* Neighbor
* Familiar stranger
* Official
* Queerplatonic relationship

Business is generally held to be distinct from personal relations, a contrasting mode which other than excursions from the norm is based on non-personal interest and rational rather than emotional concerns.

== Ways that interpersonal relationships begin ==
Proximity:
Proximity increases the chance of repeated exposure to the same person. Long-term exposure that can develop familiarity is more likely to trigger like or hate.

Technological advance:
The Internet removes the problem of lack of communication due to long distance. People can communicate with others who live far away from them through video calls or text. Internet is a medium for people to be close to others who are not physically near them.   

Similarity:
People prefer to make friends with others who are similar to them because their thoughts and feelings are more likely to be understood.

==Stages==
Interpersonal relationships are dynamic systems that change continuously during their existence. Like living organisms, relationships have a beginning, a lifespan, and an end. They tend to grow and improve gradually, as people get to know each other and become closer emotionally, or they gradually deteriorate as people drift apart, move on with their lives and form new relationships with others. One of the most influential models of relationship development was proposed by psychologist George Levinger. This model was formulated to describe heterosexual, adult romantic relationships, but it has been applied to other kinds of interpersonal relations as well. According to the model, the natural development of a relationship follows five stages:

#&quot; Acquaintance and acquaintanceship&quot; – Becoming acquainted depends on previous relationships, physical proximity, first impressions, and a variety of other factors. If two people begin to like each other, continued interactions may lead to the next stage, but acquaintance can continue indefinitely. Another example is the association.
#&quot; Buildup&quot; – During this stage, people begin to trust and care about each other. The need for intimacy, compatibility and such filtering agents as common background and goals will influence whether or not interaction continues.
#&quot; Continuation&quot; – This stage follows a mutual commitment to quite a strong and close long-term friendship, romantic relationship, or even marriage. It is generally a long, relatively stable period. Nevertheless, continued growth and development will occur during this time. Mutual trust is important for sustaining the relationship.
#&quot; Deterioration&quot; – Not all relationships deteriorate, but those that do tend to show signs of trouble. Boredom, resentment, and dissatisfaction may occur, and individuals may communicate less and avoid self-disclosure. Loss of trust and betrayals may take place as the downward spiral continues, eventually ending the relationship. (Alternately, the participants may find some way to resolve the problems and reestablish trust and belief in others.)
#&quot; Ending&quot; – The final stage marks the end of the relationship, either by breakups, death or by spatial separation for quite some time and severing all existing ties of either friendship or romantic love.

=== Terminating a relationship ===
According to the latest &quot;Systematic Review of the Economic Literature on the Factors associated with Life Satisfaction&quot; (dating from 2007), stable and secure relationships are beneficial, and correspondingly, relationship dissolution is harmful.

The American Psychological Association has summarized the evidence on breakups. Breaking up can actually be a positive experience when the relationship did not expand the self and when the breakup leads to personal growth. They also recommend some ways to cope with the experience:

* Purposefully focusing on the positive aspects of the breakup (&quot;factors leading up to the break-up, the actual break-up, and the time right after the break-up&quot;)
* Minimizing the negative emotions
* Journaling the positive aspects of the breakup (e.g. &quot;comfort, confidence, empowerment, energy, happiness, optimism, relief, satisfaction, thankfulness, and wisdom&quot;). This exercise works best, although not exclusively, when the breakup is mutual.

Less time between a breakup and a subsequent relationship predicts higher self-esteem, attachment security, emotional stability, respect for your new partner, and greater well-being. Furthermore, rebound relationships do not last any shorter than regular relationships. 60% of people are friends with one or more ex. 60% of people have had an off-and-on relationship. 37% of cohabiting couples, and 23% of the married, have broken up and gotten back together with their existing partner.

Terminating a marital relationship implies divorce or annulment. One reason cited for divorce is infidelity. The determinants of unfaithfulness are debated by dating service providers, feminists, academics, and science communicators. According to Psychology Today, women&#x27;s, rather than men&#x27;s, level of commitment more strongly determines if a relationship will continue.

== Pathological relationships ==
Research conducted in Iran and other countries has shown that conflicts are common between couples, and, in Iran, 92% of the respondents reported that they had conflicts in their marriages. These conflicts can cause major problems for couples and they are caused due to multiple reasons.

===Abusive===
Abusive relationships involve either maltreatment or violence such as physical abuse, physical neglect, sexual abuse, and emotional maltreatment. Abusive relationships within the family are very prevalent in the United States and usually involve women or children as victims. Common individual factors for abusers include low self-esteem, poor impulse control, external locus of control, drug use, alcohol abuse, and negative affectivity. There are also external factors such as stress, poverty, and loss which contribute to likelihood of abuse.

===Codependent===
Codependency initially focused on a codependent partner enabling substance abuse, but it has become more broadly defined to describe a dysfunctional relationship with extreme dependence on or preoccupation with another person. There are some who even refer to codependency as an addiction to the relationship. The focus of codependents tends to be on the emotional state, behavioral choices, thoughts, and beliefs of another person. Often those who are codependent neglect themselves in favor of taking care of others and have difficulty fully developing an identity of their own.

===Narcissistic===
Narcissists focus on themselves and often distance themselves from intimate relationships; the focus of narcissistic interpersonal relationships is to promote one&#x27;s self-concept. Generally, narcissists show less empathy in relationships and view love pragmatically or as a game involving others&#x27; emotions.

Narcissists are usually part of the personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). In relationships, they tend to affect the other person as they attempt to use them to enhance their self-esteem. Specific types of NPD make a person incapable of having an interpersonal relationship due to their being cunning, envious, and contemptuous.

==Importance==
Human beings are innately social and are shaped by their experiences with others. There are multiple perspectives to understand this inherent motivation to interact with others.

===Need to belong===
According to Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, humans need to feel love (sexual/nonsexual) and acceptance from social groups (family, peer groups). In fact, the need to belong is so innately ingrained that it may be strong enough to overcome physiological and safety needs, such as children&#x27;s attachment to abusive parents or staying in abusive romantic relationships. Such examples illustrate the extent to which the psychobiological drive to belong is entrenched.

===Social exchange===
Another way to appreciate the importance of relationships is in terms of a reward framework. This perspective suggests that individuals engage in relations that are rewarding in both tangible and intangible ways. The concept fits into a larger theory of social exchange. This theory is based on the idea that relationships develop as a result of cost–benefit analysis. Individuals seek out rewards in interactions with others and are willing to pay a cost for said rewards. In the best-case scenario, rewards will exceed costs, producing a net gain. This can lead to &quot;shopping around&quot; or constantly comparing alternatives to maximize the benefits or rewards while minimizing costs.

===Relational self===
Relationships are also important for their ability to help individuals develop a sense of self. The relational self is the part of an individual&#x27;s self-concept that consists of the feelings and beliefs that one has regarding oneself that develops based on interactions with others. In other words, one&#x27;s emotions and behaviors are shaped by prior relationships. Relational self theory posits that prior and existing relationships influence one&#x27;s emotions and behaviors in interactions with new individuals, particularly those individuals that remind them of others in their life. Studies have shown that exposure to someone who resembles a significant other activates specific self-beliefs, changing how one thinks about oneself in the moment more so than exposure to someone who does not resemble one&#x27;s significant other.

==Power and dominance==
Power is the ability to influence the behavior of other people. When two parties have or assert unequal levels of power, one is termed &quot;dominant&quot; and the other &quot;submissive&quot;. Expressions of dominance can communicate an intention to assert or maintain dominance in a relationship. Being submissive can be beneficial because it saves time, limits emotional stress, and may avoid hostile actions such as withholding of resources, cessation of cooperation, termination of the relationship, maintaining a grudge, or even physical violence. Submission occurs in different degrees; for example, some employees may follow orders without question, whereas others might express disagreement but concede when pressed.

Groups of people can form a dominance hierarchy. For example, a hierarchical organization uses a command hierarchy for top-down management. This can reduce time wasted in conflict over unimportant decisions, prevents inconsistent decisions from harming the operations of the organization, maintain alignment of a large population of workers with the goals of the owners (which the workers might not personally share) and, if promotion is based on merit, help ensure that the people with the best expertise make important decisions. This contrasts with group decision-making and systems which encourage decision-making and self-organization by front-line employees, who in some cases may have better information about customer needs or how to work efficiently. Dominance is only one aspect of organizational structure.

A power structure describes power and dominance relationships in a larger society. For example, a feudal society under a monarchy exhibits a strong dominance hierarchy in both economics and physical power, whereas dominance relationships in a society with democracy and capitalism are more complicated.

In business relationships, dominance is often associated with economic power. For example, a business may adopt a submissive attitude to customer preferences (stocking what customers want to buy) and complaints (&quot;the customer is always right&quot;) in order to earn more money. A firm with monopoly power may be less responsive to customer complaints because it can afford to adopt a dominant position. In a business partnership a &quot;silent partner&quot; is one who adopts a submissive position in all aspects, but retains financial ownership and a share of the profits.

Two parties can be dominant in different areas. For example, in a friendship or romantic relationship, one person may have strong opinions about where to eat dinner, whereas the other has strong opinions about how to decorate a shared space. It could be beneficial for the party with weak preferences to be submissive in that area because it will not make them unhappy and avoids conflict with the party that would be unhappy.

The breadwinner model is associated with gender role assignments where the male in a heterosexual marriage would be dominant as they are responsible for economic provision.

==Relationship satisfaction==

Social exchange theory and Rusbult&#x27;s investment model show that relationship satisfaction is based on three factors: rewards, costs, and comparison levels (Miller, 2012). Rewards refer to any aspects of the partner or relationship that are positive. Conversely, costs are the negative or unpleasant aspects of the partner or their relationship. The comparison level includes what each partner expects of the relationship. The comparison level is influenced by past relationships, and general relationship expectations they are taught by family and friends.

Individuals in long-distance relationships, LDRs, rated their relationships as more satisfying than individuals in proximal relationship, PRs. Alternatively, Holt and Stone (1988) found that long-distance couples who were able to meet with their partner at least once a month had similar satisfaction levels to unmarried couples who cohabitated. Also, the relationship satisfaction was lower for members of LDRs who saw their partner less frequently than once a month. LDR couples reported the same level of relationship satisfaction as couples in PRs, despite only seeing each other on average once every 23 days.

Social exchange theory and the am investment model both theorize that relationships that are high in cost would be less satisfying than relationships that are low in cost. LDRs have a higher level of costs than PRs, therefore, one would assume that LDRs are less satisfying than PRs. Individuals in LDRs are more satisfied with their relationships compared to individuals in PRs. This can be explained by unique aspects of the LDRs, how the individuals use relationship maintenance behaviors, and the attachment styles of the individuals in the relationships. Therefore, the costs and benefits of the relationship are subjective to the individual, and people in LDRs tend to report lower costs and higher rewards in their relationship compared to PRs.

===Theories and empirical research===

====Confucianism====
Confucianism is a study and theory of relationships, especially within hierarchies. Social harmony—the central goal of Confucianism—results in part from every individual knowing their place in the social order and playing their part well. Particular duties arise from each person&#x27;s particular situation in relation to others. The individual stands simultaneously in several different relationships with different people: as a junior in relation to parents and elders; and as a senior in relation to younger siblings, students, and others. Juniors are considered in Confucianism to owe their seniors reverence and seniors have duties of benevolence and concern toward juniors. A focus on mutuality is prevalent in East Asian cultures to this day.

====Minding relationships====
The mindfulness theory of relationships shows how closeness in relationships may be enhanced. Minding is the &quot;reciprocal knowing process involving the nonstop, interrelated thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of persons in a relationship.&quot; Five components of &quot;minding&quot; include:
# Knowing and being known: seeking to understand the partner
# Making relationship-enhancing attributions for behaviors: giving the benefit of the doubt
# Accepting and respecting: empathy and social skills
# Maintaining reciprocity: active participation in relationship enhancement
# Continuity in minding: persisting in mindfulness

== In popular culture ==

=== Popular perceptions ===
Popular perceptions of intimate relationships are strongly influenced by movies and television. Common messages are that love is predestined, love at first sight is possible, and that love with the right person always succeeds. Those who consume the most romance-related media tend to believe in predestined romance and that those who are destined to be together implicitly understand each other. These beliefs, however, can lead to less communication and problem-solving as well as giving up on relationships more easily when conflict is encountered.

=== Social media ===
Social media has changed the face of interpersonal relationships. Romantic interpersonal relationships are no less impacted. For example, in the United States, Facebook has become an integral part of the dating process for emerging adults. Social media can have both positive and negative impacts on romantic relationships. For example, supportive social networks have been linked to more stable relationships. However, social media usage can also facilitate conflict, jealousy, and passive-aggressive behaviors such as spying on a partner. Aside from direct effects on the development, maintenance, and perception of romantic relationships, excessive social network usage is linked to jealousy and dissatisfaction in relationships.

A growing segment of the population is engaging in purely online dating, sometimes but not always moving towards traditional face-to-face interactions. These online relationships differ from face-to-face relationships; for example, self-disclosure may be of primary importance in developing an online relationship. Conflict management differs, since avoidance is easier and conflict resolution skills may not develop in the same way. Additionally, the definition of infidelity is both broadened and narrowed, since physical infidelity becomes easier to conceal but emotional infidelity (e.g. chatting with more than one online partner) becomes a more serious offense.

<doc id="161745" wikidata="Q314331" url="?curid=161745" title="Charles II of Naples">
<text>Charles II, also known as Charles the Lame (; ; 1254 – 5 May 1309), was King of Naples, Count of Provence and Forcalquier (1285–1309), Prince of Achaea (1285–1289), and Count of Anjou and Maine (1285–1290); he also was King of Albania (1285–1294), and claimed the Kingdom of Jerusalem from 1285. He was the son of Charles I of Anjouone of the most powerful European monarchs in the second half of the 13th centuryand Beatrice of Provence. His father granted Charles the Principality of Salerno in the Kingdom of Sicily (or &quot;Regno&quot;) in 1272 and made him regent in Provence and Forcalquier in 1279.

After the uprising known as the Sicilian Vespers against Charles&#x27;s father, the island of Sicily became an independent kingdom under the rule of Peter III of Aragon in 1282. A year later, his father made Charles regent in the mainland territories of the &quot;Regno&quot; (or the Kingdom of Naples). Charles held a general assembly where unpopular taxes were abolished and the liberties of the noblemen and clerics were confirmed. He could not prevent the Aragonese from occupying Calabria and the islands in the Gulf of Naples. The Sicilian admiral Roger of Lauria captured him in a naval battle near Naples in 1284. As he was still in prison when his father died on 7 January 1285, his realms were ruled by regents. The remainder of his rule was spent seeking a resolution to the Sicilian war, diplomatic moves concerning his inheritance, and administrating the new Kingdom of Naples.

==Early life==

Born in 1254, Charles was the son of Charles I of Anjou and Beatrice of Provence. He was the sole heir of his father&#x27;s vast dominion. By the time of Charles&#x27;s birth, his father had seized Provence and Forcalquier (in the Holy Roman Empire), Anjou and Maine (in France), and the Kingdom of Sicily (a fief of the Holy See). In the 1270s, his father also proclaimed himself King of Albania (in reference to his conquests along the Eastern coast of the Ionian Sea), partially asserted his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and inherited Achaea (in the Peloponnese). Charles&#x27;s mother died in 1267, but his father&#x27;s determination to keep his empire intact deprived Charles of his maternal inheritance during his father&#x27;s lifetime.

Charles I arranged a double marriage alliance with Stephen V of Hungary in 1269. Stephen&#x27;s daughter, Maria was engaged to Charles, and Charles&#x27;s sister, Isabelle to Maria&#x27;s brother, Ladislaus. Charles fell seriously ill in late 1271. To encourage prayers for his recovery, his father donated Charles&#x27;s wax sculptures to churches frequented by pilgrims in the whole kingdom. After Charles recovered, his father made a pilgrimage at the shrine of Saint Nicholas in Bari and sent gifts to the sanctuary of Mary the Virgin at Rocamadour.

Charles was dubbed with his brother, Philip, count of Taranto and some 100 Italian and French noble scions at the feast of Pentecost in 1272. On this occasion, his father Charles I granted him as appanage the Principality of Salerno, a fief customarily held by the heirs apparent to the throne by the previous royal house the Hauteville. The grant to Charles further stipulated that he could not claim more territories as a prince, thus keeping the area of Provence under direct royal rule.

==Regency==

However, by late 1279 his father appointed him to administer Provence. In December 1280 the duke accompanied his cousin, king Philip III of France, to Toulouse where he met with Peter III of Aragon. Peter III was the son-in-law of Manfred of Sicily who had lost the Kingdom of Sicily to Charles&#x27;s father in 1266 after the battle at Benevento. Peter insolently ignored Charles during the meeting, although both Philip III and James II of Majorca, who was also present, reminded Peter that Charles was closely related to him.

Meanwhile pope Nicholas III attempting to deter Charles I&#x27;s future power ambitions in Italy, not least to carve for his family a duchy, went in negotiations with Rudolf I the Holy Roman emperor for a reinstatement of the Kingdom of Arles that was to be given to Charles Martel, Charles I&#x27;s grandson. The dowager queen of France, Margaret of Provence, sister of Beatrice, wife of Charles I, opposed sharply to their plans. However, Charles I&#x27;s claims on territories of Alphonse of Poitiers on the latter&#x27;s death would increase substantially his rule on Provence. Pope Martin IV, a staunch supporter of Charles I, published the bull of that convention on the 24th of May 1281, where it prescribed that the erstwhile kingdom&#x27;s territories, along the duchies of Dauphiné, and Savoy with their vicinities were to be given to child couple, Charles Martel and Clemence, daughter of Rudolf, as appanage and Charles I&#x27;s son, Charles, duke of Salerno would be its regent. Margaret of Provence pursued the matter further and called the duke Robert ΙΙ of Burgundy, count Otto IV of Burgundy along with some lesser lords to a new meeting at Troyes in autumn of 1281, but as Charles I was preoccupied with the preparations for the full scale crusade against the Byzantine empire and the ruling of the court whether or not he was to inherit Alphonse&#x27;s lands, he had acknowledged his wife&#x27;s extent of territories and for the rest of the Burgundian land that they were held in fief, thus appeasing the duke Philip II and the matter ended there. 

The heavy taxation, forced loans and purveyance were among the reasons that had caused much discontent within the Italian subjects of Charles I, especially in Sicily, and that precipitated out of a seemingly insignificant cause the eruption of a civic unrest of magnitude that led to a generalised anti-French riot, known today in modern historiography as the Sicilian Vespers, in Palermo on 30 March 1282. The revolt having spread quickly put an end to the Angevin rule on the island, but since they needed a royal overlord they turned to Peter III of Aragon and Constance. Peter arrived in Sicily with a large fleet in late August and was declared king on the 4th of September 1282.

Peter III&#x27;s army arriving on Sicily meant going in war with Angevin and presumably his unbeknown arrival compelled the partial withdrawal of Charles I&#x27;s troops from the island. Peter&#x27;s advance allowed him to send forces to Calabria to attempt ousting the Angevin from the mainland too. However, the duke of Salerno headed a military reinforcement and met his father Charles I at Reggio Calabria. More troops arrived by his two nephew, Robert II, Count of Artois and Peter I of Alençon and checked the Aragonese advance. In late December 1282 Charles I challenged Peter III to a judicial duel to end their conflict on Sicily and it was agreed to take place in six months at Bordeaux. Before leaving in January 1283 Charles I appointed his son Charles, the duke of Salerno as regent of the kingdom. The inexperience of the duke led him to a chain of wrong decisions that by the time Charles I returned to Naples the kingdom was on the brink of collapsing. The news of the duke&#x27;s capture lit a flame of riot in Naples, but the papal legate Gerard of Parma crushed it at its beginning. Charles I tried to undo the situation and marched with his troops to Calabria and even besieged the town but on the Aragonese relief forces arrival he withdrew to San Martino di Taurianova.

A general assembly was held at the king&#x27;s camp near San Martino with the barons, prelates and envoys of the towns and it was decided that the royal monopoly on salt and exchanges of the petty coinage were to be abolished. The assembly also decided that the monarchs were allowed to levy the &quot;subventio generalis&quot;, a very unpopular tax only after having consulted with representatives of their subjects. The liberties of the noblemen and the clergy were reconfirmed, while the commoners&#x27; obligations to contribute in a corvée fashion to the maintenance of the royal fortresses and flee were reduced. The reforms adopted at the assembly made the continuation of his father&#x27;s active foreign policy impossible.

Charles in his father absence strengthened his ties with native aristocracy by appointing members of the Aquinas, Ruffo and Sanseverino families to his royal council. He also tried to make his father&#x27;s most unpopular officials scapegoats for some of the abuses that were made during the latter&#x27;s reign. In June 1283, he ordered the imprisonment of all male members of the della Marre and Rufouli families, two prominent noble families that had often been entrusted with the collection of the taxes and custom duties in Charles I&#x27;s reign. While the heads of those two families were executed to silence the popular voice, the rest of the incarcerated male members were held to ransom, the release of whom cost huge amounts of money to their relatives.

Charles as a regent could not finance a lengthy war and he resorted to borrowing some thousands of ounces of gold from the Holy See, the kings of France and England, the ruler of Tunis, Tuscan bankers, and from the rest of the towns of the mainland, known as the &quot;Regno&quot;. Gerard of Parma also persuaded the Southern Italian prelates to cede a part of their revenues to Charles for the war against the rebels and their supporters. He could then equip 40 new galleys in Provence. The Aragonese fleet had meanwhile imposed a blockade on the island of Malta. Charles dispatched his new fleet to the island, but the Sicilian admiral, Roger of Lauria, attacked and almost annihilated the Provençal galleys before reaching Malta. Lauria soon occupied the islands of Capri and Ischia, which enabled him to make frequent raids against the Bay of Naples, whereas the capturing of another islet that of Nisida, allowed for the imposion of a blockade in Naples. 

==Captivity==

The inhabitants of Naples urged Charles I to expel the Aragonese from Nisida. Although his father had forbidden him to attack the Aragonese until his arrival, Charles decided to invade the islet. Believing that most Aragonese ships had left the Bay of Naples, he sailed for Nisida on 5 June 1284, but the Aragonese galleys soon surrounded and defeated his fleet. During the battle, Charles fell into captivity. He was first taken to Messina where the crowd demanded his execution in revenge for Conradin (Manfred of Sicily&#x27;s young nephew, who had been beheaded at Charles I&#x27;s order in 1268). To save Charles&#x27;s life, Constance of SicilyPeter III of Aragon&#x27;s wifeimprisoned him at the fortress of Cefalù.

Charles I died on 7 January 1285. On his deathbed, he had made Robert of Artois regent for the minor Charles Martel who would rule as vicar general until Charles was released from captivity. The Provençal delegates held a general assembly at Sisteron and decided to do their utmost to secure Charles&#x27;s release. Pope Martin IV partially ignored Charles I&#x27;s last will. He did not acknowledge the right either of the captive Charles or of his minor son to rule, claiming that an interregnum followed the king&#x27;s death. The pope confirmed Artois&#x27; regency, but he made Cardinal Gerald co-regent, authorizing them to administer the kingdom on behalf of the Holy See. The regents appointed the most powerful ruler of the Peloponnese, William I de la Roche, Duke of Athens, bailiff of Achaea to secure the local lords&#x27; loyalty. Odo Poilechienwho had been made baillif during Charles I&#x27;s reigncontinued to rule Acre which was the only town to acknowledge Charles&#x27;s rule in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Pope Martin died on 29 March 1285. The crusade that he had declared against Aragon started in late May, but Peter III&#x27;s resistance forced the crusaders to withdraw in September. At Peter&#x27;s order, Charles was moved from Cefalù to Catalonia. Peter died on 10 November; his eldest sons, Alfonso III and James succeeded him in Aragon and Sicily, respectively. Henry II of Cyprus, who was regarded the lawful king of Jerusalem by most local lords, forced Odo Poilechien to leave Acre in June 1286. Since the Knights Templar and Hospitallers supported Henry, their estates were confiscated in the &quot;Regno&quot;.

Charles&#x27;s sons sent a letter to Edward I of England, asking him to intervene to secure their father&#x27;s release. Edward accepted their offer and mediated a fourteen-month truce in July 1286. James entered into negotiations with Charles about the conditions of Charles&#x27;s release. Charles was ready to renounce the island of Sicily and Calabria in favor of James for at least the rest of his own lifetime, but Pope Honorius IV sharply opposed this plan. After Honorius died on 3 April 1287, Edward I mediated a compromise, which was completed in the presence of the delegates of the College of Cardinals in Oloron-Sainte-Marie in July. However, Philip IV of France refused to sign it, because it did not arrange for the compensation of his younger brother, Charles of Valois, who had laid claim to Aragon.

The new pope, Nicholas IV, who was enthroned in February 1288, also disapproved the treaty, but allowed Edward I to continue the negotiations. A new agreement, repeating most terms of the previous compromise, was signed at Canfranc in October. According to the treaty, Charles was to be released for a ransom of 50,000 marks of silver, but he also had to promise to mediate a reconciliation between Aragon, France and the Holy See. He pledged that he would send his three sonsCharles Martel, Louis and Robertand 60 Provençal noblemen as hostages to Aragon to secure the fulfilment of his promise. He also promised that he would return to Aragon if he could not persuade his allies to make peace with Aragon in three years. After Edward I gave further guarantees, Alfonso III released Charles who went to Paris to start negotiations with Philip IV. Philip again repudiated the treaty and Charles left France for Italy to meet with the pope.

==Reign==

===Start of his reign===

Pope Nicholas IV crowned Charles king in Rieti on Whit Sunday 1289. To persuade Charles to continue the war for Sicily, the pope granted the tenth of Church revenues from Southern Italy to him. The pope also absolved Charles from the promises that he had made to secure his release. Edward I of England protested against the pope&#x27;s decision and continued to mediate between Charles and Alfonso III of Aragon. At Edward&#x27;s request, Alfonso III released Charles Martel in exchange for Charles&#x27;s fifth son, Raymond Berengar.

Influenced by Bartolomeo da Capua and his other advisors, Charles adopted a concept about the establishment of a purely Christian kingdom. He ordered the expulsion of the Jews and Lombards from Anjou and Maine, accusing them of usury, and the Jews of &quot;dwelling randomly&quot; with the Christian population and cohabiting with Christian women. He linked the expulsion of the Jews to general taxation of the population as &quot;recompense&quot; for lost income. Applying the blood libel against the Jews of Southern Italy, he forced many of them to convert to Christianity. He also introduced the Inquisition in the Regno.

Alfonso III invaded Charles&#x27;s realm and laid siege to Gaeta, because he thought that the burghers were ready to rise up against Charles, but the town resisted. Charles Martel and Robert of Artois led troops to the town and surrounded the besiegers. Edward I of England sent envoys to Charles, urging him to respect the treaty of Canfranc. The pope dispatched two cardinals to prevent the reconciliation, but Charles and Alfonse signed a two-year truce. To secure stability in Achaea, Charles decided to restore a line of local rulers in the principality. He arranged a marriage for Isabella of Villehardouinthe daughter of the last native prince, William IIwith a successful military commander, Florent of Hainaut. In September, he granted Achaea to them, but he kept his right to suzerainty over the principality and also stipulated that if Florent predeceased her, Isabella could not remarry without his consent.

===Negotiations===

Charles left Southern Italy to start new negotiations with Philip IV. Before visiting Paris, he went to the Aragonese frontier to offer himself for imprisonment on 1 November in accordance with the treaty of Canfranc, but nobody came to arrest him. Charles and Philip IV signed a treaty at Senlis on 19 May 1290. Charles gave his daughter, Margaret, in marriage to Charles of Valois, giving Anjou and Maine to him as her dowry in return for his promise to abandon his claim to Aragon with the pope&#x27;s consent. Philip IV also promised that he would make peace with Aragon as soon as Alfonso III and the Holy See were reconciled.

The envoys of all parties, but James of Sicily, started negotiations with the mediation of English delegates at Perpignan, and continued them in Tarascon in late 1290 and early 1291. They reached a compromise which was included in a treaty in Brignoles on 19 February 1291. The document confirmed most terms of the treaty of Senlis and restored the peace between Alfonso III, Philip IV and Charles. Charles received the districts of Avignon held by the French monarch. The Holy See also accepted the terms of the treaty because Alfonso of Aragon promised that he would lead a crusade against the Mamluks of Egypt.

The treaty of Brignoles deprived Alfonso&#x27;s brother, James of Sicily, of Aragonese support, but Alfonso unexpectedly died on 18 June. James succeeded Alfonso in Aragon, but he did not want to cede the island of Sicily and Calabria to Charles and made his younger brother, Frederick, his lieutenant. The Mamluks occupied the last strongholds in the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the summer of 1291. Pope Nicholas IV called for a new crusade and urged the Christian &quot;kings, princes and prelates&quot; to send their proposals about the recovery of the Holy Land. Charles was the only monarch to answer the pope. He suggested that the sole grand master of the united military orders, who should be appointed from about the royal princes, was to rule the reconquered Kingdom of Jerusalem.

After realising that his new subjects would not support a war for Sicily, James sent envoys to Rome to start negotiations about his submission shortly before Pope Nicholas died on 4 April 1292. Charles was also willing to reach a compromise, because he wanted to secure Hungary for his family. Charles&#x27;s brother-in-law, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, had been murdered on 10 July 1290. The Hungarian noblemen elected Ladislaus&#x27; cousin, Andrew III, king, although Andrew&#x27;s legitimacy was doubtful. Charles&#x27;s wife regarded herself Ladislaus&#x27; lawful heir. Claiming that Hungary was the fief of the Holy See, Pope Nicholas IV granted Hungary to her son, Charles Martel, in 1292. The most powerful noblemen in Croatia and Slavoniatwo realms ruled by the kings of Hungaryaccepted the pope&#x27;s decision. Charles made donations to them to secure their support, but Charles Martel could never assert his claim.

The death of Pope Nicholas IV gave rise to a prolonged interregnum. Charles continued the negotiations with James with the mediation of Sancho IV of Castile. An agreement was completed in Figueras in late 1293. James agreed to give up Sicily in return for a compensation. To put an end to the interregnum in Rome, Charles persuaded the cardinals to elect Peter of Morronea hermit who had been known for his apocalyptic visionspope. Being grateful to Charles, Pope Celestine V granted him Church revenues from France, the Holy Roman Empire and England to finance a new military campaign against Sicily. After Celestine abdicated in December 1294, the cardinals elected Benedetto Caetani pope. Pope Boniface VIII was determined to put an end to the war, because he wanted to declare a new crusade for the reconquest of the Holy Land.

===Peace===

Pope Boniface VIII confirmed the compromise between James and Charles in Anagni on 12 June 1295. However, the Sicilians refused the Treaty of Anagni and James of Aragon&#x27;s brother, Frederick, was crowned king of Sicily on 12 December 1295. Frederick soon made a raid against Basilicata.

An attempt was made to bribe Frederick into consenting to this arrangement, but being backed up by his people he refused, and was afterwards crowned King of Sicily. The ensuing war was fought on land and sea, but Charles, though aided by the Pope, his cousin Charles of Valois and James, was unable to conquer the island, and his son the prince of Taranto was taken prisoner at the Battle of La Falconara in 1299. Peace was at last made in 1302 at Caltabellotta. Charles gave up all rights to Sicily and agreed to the marriage of his daughter Eleanor and King Frederick; the treaty was ratified by the Pope in 1303. Charles spent his last years quietly in Naples, which city he improved and embellished.

He died in Naples in May 1309, and was succeeded by his son Robert the Wise, with his eldest grandson Charles I of Hungary excluded from Neapolitan succession.

==Family==

<text>Wilnelia, Lady Forsyth-Johnson (&quot;née&quot; Merced Cruz; born 12 October 1957) is a Puerto Rican former actress, model and beauty queen. She was crowned Miss World 1975, and was married to British entertainer Sir Bruce Forsyth from 1983 until his death in August 2017.

==Career==

Born in Caguas, Puerto Rico, Merced won Miss Mundo de Puerto Rico 1975 and went on to win the Miss World 1975 title at the Royal Albert Hall in London. She remained the only Puerto Rican to win the title until Stephanie Del Valle was crowned Miss World 2016 after serving as a judge for the pageant. She travelled widely during 1975 and was invited to El Salvador by the Salvadorean military government before the civil war. 

After passing on her crown in 1976, she was signed by Ford Models in New York City. In 1978, a giant poster of Wilnelia Merced was displayed in Times Square. She was introduced to British television entertainer Bruce Forsyth at the 1980 Miss World competition gala in London. While still a public figure at home in Puerto Rico, she retired from modelling after her marriage to Forsyth in 1983.

==Personal life==
Merced married Bruce Forsyth in New York in 1983. The couple&#x27;s son, Jonathan Joseph (&quot;JJ&quot;), was born in November 1986. She remained married to Forsyth until his death in August 2017. She now lives with her son near the Wentworth Estate in Surrey, England.

On 29 January 2018, for the first time, Merced spoke openly about the final days she spent with her husband before his death. She expressed her appreciation of being able to be with him at the last moment. She felt &quot;lucky&quot; that all the close family members managed to say goodbye at his deathbed. Merced recalled that Forsyth was surrounded by all his daughters, who kept him company and watched films together. Merced said that Forsyth had wished to celebrate his hundredth birthday at the London Palladium.

A portrait of Merced is displayed in the , with others, in their &quot;Women with their own style&quot; exhibit.

<text>Kotoka International Airport is an international airport in Accra, the capital of Ghana. The airport is operated by Ghana Airports Company Limited (GACL), which has its offices on the airport property. Until the upgrading of the Tamale and Kumasi airports to international standards, KIA, for a long time, was the sole international airport in Ghana.

In 2023, the airport served a record of 3.1 million passengers, a recovery from the 1.2 million in 2020 (reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic). It presently serves as a hub for domestic and regional operator Africa World Airlines, and a base for domestic operator Passion Air.

The airport consists of two passenger terminals, Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. Terminal 2 serves only domestic flights, while Terminal 3 serves regional, international, and long-haul operators. Terminal 1 is presently no longer in use but will be redeveloped into an FBO. Terminal 3 has the capacity for large aircraft such as the Airbus A380.

The airport has been recognized as the &quot;Best Airport in Africa&quot; (2-5 million pax per annum) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 by Airports Council International.

==History==

The airport was originally a military airport used by the British Royal Air Force during World War II. The facility was handed over to civilian authorities after the war. A development project was launched in 1956 by President Kwame Nkrumah to reconfigure the structure into a terminal building. The project was completed in 1958, turning the military base into an airport with a capacity of 500,000 passengers per year. The airport was originally named Accra International Airport.

In 1969, the Accra International Airport was renamed Kotoka International Airport, in honor of Lieutenant General Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka (1926–1967), a member of the National Liberation Council. Kotoka was killed in an abortive coup attempt at a location that is now the forecourt of the airport.

=== Terminal 3 ===
Construction officially commenced on 1 March 2016 on a new $274 million Terminal 3 which is capable of handling 5 million passengers a year, with an expansion potential of up to 6.5 million. The sod-cutting was done by President John Dramani Mahama and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan The new Terminal 3 will handle 1,250 passengers an hour, equipped with three business lounges, a large commercial and retail area and six boarding bridges. The terminal opened to passengers on 15 September 2018 and officially inaugurated on 2 October by President Nana Akufo-Addo.

=== Controversy over airport name ===
There has been considerable debate over the years as to whether it was fitting to rename the airport from Accra International Airport to Kotoka International Airport from General Kotoka. Many argue that the airport was built by Dr Kwame Nkrumah, and that it is not fitting to name it after Kotoka, who led a coup to overthrow Nkrumah&#x27;s government.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===

===Cargo===

Kotoka International Airport is served by numerous cargo airlines on a regularly scheduled basis, in addition to ad-hoc cargo flights.

* Air Ghana
* Cargolux
* DHL Aviation
* Emirates SkyCargo
* Ethiopian Airlines Cargo
* Qatar Airways Cargo
* Turkish Cargo

In 2016, Air Ghana opened the Ghana Airport Cargo Center, a 10,000 sq.m dedicated cargo warehouse facility supplemented by 9,000 sq.m of office space, in partnership with Ghana Airports Company Limited and Swissport.

== Statistics ==

The activity of passengers, cargo and flight movements through the airport each year is given in the table below :
== Airport City ==

Airport City Accra is an urban development centered around Kotoka International Airport.

The development is promoted by Ghana Airports Company Limited on the principle that airports have ceased to be mere terminals, but rather economic growth outlets to promote trade and generate employment.

Developments within Airport City include retail outlets such as Marina Mall, hotels such as Accra Marriott Hotel, ibis Styles Accra and Holiday Inn Accra Airport, as well as corporate offices for companies such as Africa World Airlines and Vodafone Ghana. Projects underway include the five-star Pullman Accra Airport City by Accor and the Protea Hotel by Marriott Accra Airport.

International airlines such as American Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Turkish Airlines also have their ticketing and sales offices located within Airport City.

Airport City is expected to host multiple stations on the proposed Accra Sky Train system.

==Military use==
The airport shares its facilities with Air Force Base Accra, an installation of the Ghana Air Force. It hosts a squadron of Airbus C295 transport aircraft, as well as a helicopter squadron with Harbin Z-9 and Mil Mi-17 utility helicopters.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 5 June 2000, a Ghana Airlink Fokker F-27 en route from Tamale to Accra crashed on approach to Kotoka International Airport. Six people were killed.
* On 28 January 2009, a Ghana International Airlines Boeing 757 operating from Accra to London Gatwick, United Kingdom, with 96 passengers and nine crew reported anomalies with the control systems when climbing out of Accra. The crew declared a mayday and made a safe return to Kotoka International Airport where the remains of a beetle-like creature were discovered to be obstructing the left pitot system.

* On 2 June 2012, an Allied Air Boeing 727 cargo aircraft operating from Lagos to Accra on behalf of DHL with 4 crew overshot the runway while landing in heavy rain. At least 12 people on the ground were killed. The 4 crew all survived.
* On 28 October 2014, a Starbow BAe 146-200 from Accra to Takoradi Airport with 77 people on board suffered a hydraulic failure during climb out. The crew were forced to make an emergency landing in Accra without flaps, resulting in damage to the landing gear and a fire. Two persons were injured in the resulting emergency evacuation. The aircraft was written off.

* On 10 January 2015, an ASKY Airlines Boeing 737-43QSF (leased from Ethiopian Airlines), was damaged beyond repair in a landing accident and runway excursion. The aircraft was written off and there were no fatalities.
* On 25 November 2017, a Starbow ATR 72-500 suffered a runway excursion due to the captain&#x27;s seat sliding backward during the take-off roll. The aircraft struck the airport perimeter fence before coming to a halt. Five passengers were injured, and the aircraft was written off with significant damage.

== COVID-19 pandemic ==

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic flights in Ghana were suspended from 30 March 2020, but resumed on 1 May 2020 under enhanced sanitary protocols. Ghana was the first African country to resume domestic flights after a COVID-related suspension.

The international air borders of Ghana reopened for travelers on 1 September 2020, subject to certain conditions. Passengers were required to undergo a PCR test in their country of origin no more than 72 hours prior to departure, and also undergo a further rapid antigen test upon arrival at Kotoka International Airport. A laboratory was set up at the airport for prompt processing of test results. The cost of the tests were set at US$50 for citizens of ECOWAS countries, and US$150 for all other citizens. Those testing negative on both tests were permitted to enter Ghana without any further quarantine or restrictions, subject to clearance by Ghana Immigration Service.

In February 2021, the process of awarding the contract for testing at the airport to Frontiers Healthcare came under scrutiny for its lack of transparency during the vetting hearings for various ministers appointed to the second cabinet of President Nana Akufo-Addo.

In March 2022, the parliamentary opposition threatened to demonstrate at the airport in protest against the continued high costs for on-arrival testing of passengers. Industry experts also warned that the high costs of testing were likely to suppress passenger numbers for 2022 if not addressed as a priority. In response to this, the testing requirements for fully vaccinated passengers were waived effective 28 March 2022.

<doc id="161757" wikidata="Q270648" url="?curid=161757" title="P. D. James">
<text>Phyllis Dorothy James White, Baroness James of Holland Park (3 August 1920 – 27 November 2014), known professionally as P. D. James, was an English novelist and life peer. Her rise to fame came with her series of detective novels featuring the police commander and poet, Adam Dalgliesh.

== Life and career ==
James was born in Oxford, the daughter of Sidney Victor James, a tax inspector, and his wife, Dorothy Mary James. She was educated at the British School in Ludlow and Cambridge High School for Girls. Her mother was committed to a mental hospital when James was in her mid-teens.

She had to leave school at the age of sixteen to work to take care of her younger siblings, sister Monica, and brother Edward, because her family did not have much money and her father did not believe in higher education for girls. She worked in a tax office in Ely for three years and later found a job as an assistant stage manager for the Festival Theatre in Cambridge. She married Ernest Connor Bantry White (called &quot;Connor&quot;), an army doctor, on 8 August 1941. They had two daughters, Clare and Jane.

White returned from the Second World War mentally ill and was institutionalised. With her daughters being mostly cared for by Connor&#x27;s parents, James studied hospital administration, and from 1949 to 1968 worked for a hospital board in London. She began writing in the mid-1950s, using her maiden name (&quot;My genes are James genes&quot;).

Her first novel, &quot;Cover Her Face&quot;, featuring the investigator and poet Adam Dalgliesh of New Scotland Yard, was published in 1962. Dalgliesh&#x27;s last name comes from a teacher of English at Cambridge High School and his first name is that of Miss Dalgliesh&#x27;s father. Many of James&#x27;s mystery novels take place against the backdrop of UK bureaucracies, such as the criminal justice system and the National Health Service, in which she worked for decades starting in the 1940s. Two years after the publication of &quot;Cover Her Face&quot;, James&#x27;s husband died on 5 August 1964. Prior to his death, James had not felt able to change her job: &quot;He [Connor] would periodically discharge himself from hospital, sometimes at very short notice, and I never knew quite what I would have to face when I returned home from the office. It was not a propitious time to look for promotion or for a new job, which would only impose additional strain. But now [after Connor&#x27;s death] I felt the strong need to look for a change of direction.&quot; She applied for the grade of Principal in the Home Civil Service and held positions as a civil servant within several sections of the Home Office, including the criminal section. She worked in government service until her retirement in 1979.

On 7 February 1991, James was created a life peer as Baroness James of Holland Park, of Southwold in the County of Suffolk. She sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative. She was an Anglican and a lay patron of the Prayer Book Society. Her 2001 work, &quot;Death in Holy Orders&quot;, displays her familiarity with the inner workings of church hierarchy. Her later novels were often set in a community closed in some way, such as a publishing house, barristers&#x27; chambers, a theological college, an island or a private clinic. &quot;Talking About Detective Fiction&quot; was published in 2009. Over her writing career, James also wrote many essays and short stories for periodicals and anthologies, which have yet to be collected. She said in 2011 that &quot;The Private Patient&quot; was the final Dalgliesh novel. However, at the time of her death, she had been planning another Dalgliesh novel, set in Southwold.

As guest editor of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme in December 2009, James conducted an interview with the Director General of the BBC, Mark Thompson, in which she seemed critical of some of his decisions. Regular &quot;Today&quot; presenter Evan Davis commented that &quot;She shouldn&#x27;t be guest editing; she should be permanently presenting the programme.&quot; In 2008, she was inducted into the International Crime Writing Hall of Fame at the inaugural ITV3 Crime Thriller Awards.

In August 2014, James was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

James&#x27; main home was her house at 58 Holland Park Avenue, in the area from which she took her title; she also owned homes in Oxford and Southwold.
James died from cancer at her home in Oxford on 27 November 2014, aged 94. She is survived by her two daughters, Clare and Jane, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

== Film and television ==
During the 1980s and 1990s, many of James&#x27;s mystery novels were adapted for television by Anglia Television for the ITV network in the UK. These productions have been broadcast in other countries, including the US on the PBS network. Roy Marsden played Adam Dalgliesh. According to James in conversation with Bill Link on 3 May 2001 at the Writer&#x27;s Guild Theatre, Los Angeles, Marsden &quot;is not my idea of Dalgliesh, but I would be very surprised if he were.&quot; The BBC adapted &quot;Death in Holy Orders&quot; in 2003, and &quot;The Murder Room&quot; in 2004, both as one-off dramas starring Martin Shaw as Dalgliesh. In &quot;Dalgliesh&quot; (2021), Bertie Carvel starred as the titular, enigmatic detective–poet. Six episodes, shown as three two-parters, premiered on Acorn TV on 1 November 2021 in the United States followed by a Channel 5 premiere on 4 November in the United Kingdom. A further six episodes started to air on Channel 5 in April 2023.

Her novel &quot;The Children of Men&quot; (1992) was the basis for the feature film &quot;Children of Men&quot; (2006), directed by Alfonso Cuarón and starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine. Despite substantial changes from the book, James was reportedly pleased with the adaptation and proud to be associated with the film.

A three-episode adaptation of her novel &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot;, written by Juliette Towhidi, was made into the TV series &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot; by Origin Pictures for BBC One. It was first shown in the UK over three nights from 26 December 2013 as part of the BBC&#x27;s Christmas schedule and stars Anna Maxwell Martin as Elizabeth, Matthew Rhys as Mr Darcy, Jenna Coleman as Lydia and Matthew Goode as Wickham.

<text>A poppy is a flowering plant in the subfamily Papaveroideae of the family Papaveraceae. Poppies are herbaceous plants, often grown for their colourful flowers. One species of poppy, &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;, is the source of the narcotic drug mixture opium, which contains powerful medicinal alkaloids such as morphine and has been used since ancient times as an analgesic and narcotic medicinal and recreational drug. It also produces edible seeds. Following the trench warfare in the poppy fields of Flanders, Belgium, during World War I, poppies have become a symbol of remembrance of soldiers who have died during wartime, especially in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other Commonwealth realms.

==Description==

Poppies are herbaceous annual, biennial or short-lived perennial plants. Some species are monocarpic, dying after flowering.

Poppies can be over tall with flowers up to across. Flowers of species (not cultivars) have 4 or 6 petals, many stamens forming a conspicuous whorl in the center of the flower and an ovary of from 2 to many fused carpels. The petals are showy, may be of almost any colour and some have markings. The petals are crumpled in the bud and as blooming finishes, the petals often lie flat before falling away.

In the temperate zones, poppies bloom from spring into early summer. Most species secrete latex when injured. Bees use poppies as a pollen source. The pollen of the oriental poppy, &quot;Papaver orientale&quot;, is dark blue, that of the field or corn poppy (&quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot;) is grey to dark green. The opium poppy, &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;, grows wild in Southeast Europe and Southeast Asia. It is believed that it originated in the Mediterranean region.
Poppies belong to the subfamily Papaveroideae of the family Papaveraceae, which includes the following genera:
* &quot;Papaver&quot; – &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot;, &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;, &quot;Papaver orientale&quot;, &quot;Papaver nudicaule&quot;, &quot;Papaver cambricum&quot;
* &quot;Eschscholzia&quot; – &quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;
* &quot;Meconopsis&quot; – &quot;Meconopsis napaulensis&quot;
* &quot;Glaucium&quot; - the horned poppies including &quot;Glaucium flavum&quot; and &quot;Glaucium corniculatum&quot;
* &quot;Stylophorum&quot; – celandine poppy
* &quot;Argemone&quot; – prickly poppy
* &quot;Romneya&quot; – matilija poppy and relatives
* &quot;Canbya&quot; – pygmy poppy
* &quot;Stylomecon&quot; – wind poppy
* &quot;Arctomecon&quot; – desert bearpaw poppy
* &quot;Hunnemannia&quot; – tulip poppy
* &quot;Dendromecon&quot; – tree poppy

==Uses and cultivation==

The flowers of most poppy species are attractive and are widely cultivated as annual or perennial ornamental plants. This has resulted in a number of commercially important cultivars, such as the Shirley poppy, a cultivar of &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot; and semi-double or double (flore plena) forms of the opium poppy &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; and oriental poppy (&quot;Papaver orientale&quot;). Poppies of several other genera are also cultivated in gardens.

Poppy seeds are rich in oil, carbohydrates, calcium and protein. Poppy oil is often used as cooking oil, salad dressing oil, or in products such as margarine. Poppy oil can also be added to spices for cakes or breads. Poppy products are also used in different paints, varnishes, and some cosmetics.

A few species have other uses, principally as sources of drugs and foods. The opium poppy is widely cultivated and its worldwide production is monitored by international agencies. It is used for production of dried latex and opium, the principal precursor of narcotic and analgesic opiates such as morphine, heroin, and codeine. 

=== Traditional medicine ===
Poppy seeds contain small quantities of both morphine and codeine, which are pain-relieving drugs. Poppy seeds and fixed oils can also be nonnarcotic because when they are harvested about twenty days after the flower has opened, the morphine is no longer present. Poppy cultivation is strictly regulated worldwide, with the exception of India where opium gum, which also contains the analgesic thebaine, is legally produced.

==History==
&quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; was domesticated by the indigenous people of Western and Central Europe between 6000 and 3500 BC. However, it is believed that its origins may come from the Sumerian people, where the first use of opium was recognized. Poppies and opium made their way around the world along the silk road. Juglets resembling poppy seed pods have been discovered with trace amounts of opium and the flower appeared in jewelry and on art pieces in Ancient Egypt, dated 1550–1292 BC.

The eradication of poppy cultivation came about in the early 1900s through international conferences due to safety concerns associated with the production of opium. In the 1970s the American war on drugs targeted Turkish production of the plant, leading to a more negative popular opinion of the U.S.

==In culture==
The girl&#x27;s given name &quot;Poppy&quot; is taken from the name of the flower.

A poppy flower is depicted on the reverse of the Macedonian 500-denar banknote, issued in 1996 and 2003. The poppy is also part of the coat of arms of North Macedonia.

Canada has issued special quarters (25-cent coins) with a red poppy on the reverse in 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2015. The 2004 Canadian &quot;poppy&quot; quarter was the world&#x27;s first coloured circulation coin.

==Symbolism==

Poppies have long been used as a symbol of sleep, peace, and death: Sleep because the opium extracted from them is a sedative, and death because of the common blood-red colour of the red poppy in particular. In Greek and Roman myths, poppies were used as offerings to the dead. Poppies used as emblems on tombstones symbolize eternal sleep. This symbolism was evoked in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s 1900 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, in which a magical poppy field threatened to make the protagonists sleep forever.

A second interpretation of poppies in Classical mythology is that the bright scarlet colour signifies a promise of resurrection after death.

Red-flowered poppy is unofficially considered the national flower of the Albanians in Albania, Kosovo and elsewhere. This is due to its red and black colours, the same as the colours of the flag of Albania. Red poppies are also the national flower of Poland. The California poppy, &quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;, is the state flower of California.

The powerful symbolism of &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot; has been borrowed by various advocacy campaigns, such as the White Poppy and Simon Topping&#x27;s black poppy.

===Wartime remembrance===
The poppy of wartime remembrance is &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot;, the red-flowered corn poppy. This poppy is a common plant of disturbed ground in Europe and is found in many locations, including Flanders, which is the setting of the famous poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; by the Canadian surgeon and soldier John McCrae. In Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, artificial poppies (plastic in Canada, paper in the UK, Australia, South Africa, Malta and New Zealand) are worn to commemorate those who died in war. This form of commemoration is associated with Remembrance Day, which falls on 11 November. In Canada, Australia and the UK, poppies are often worn from the beginning of November through to the 11th, or Remembrance Sunday if that falls on a later date. In New Zealand and Australia, soldiers are also commemorated on ANZAC day (25 April), although the poppy is still commonly worn around Remembrance Day. Wearing of poppies has been a custom since 1924 in the United States. Moina Michael of Georgia is credited as the founder of the Memorial Poppy in the United States.

Artificial poppies (called &quot;Buddy Poppies&quot;) are used in the veterans&#x27; aid campaign by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which provides money to the veterans who assemble the poppies and various aid programs to veterans and their families.

<text>The Rosetta Project is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to develop a contemporary version of the historic Rosetta Stone. Run by the Long Now Foundation, the project aims to create a survey and near-permanent archive of 1,500 languages that can enable comparative linguistic research and education and might help recover or revitalize lost languages in the future.

The project works through an open-contribution, open-review process similar to the one that created the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. The archive will be publicly available in three media: a HD-Rosetta micro-etched nickel alloy disc three inches (7.62 cm) across with a 2,000-year life expectancy; a single-volume monumental reference book; and a growing online archive. 

==Concept==
Half to 90 percent of the world&#x27;s languages are predicted to disappear in the next century, many with little or no significant documentation. Some of these languages have fewer than one thousand speakers left. Others are considered to be dying out because language policy based on an official language is increasing the prevalence of major languages that are used as the medium of instruction in public schools and national media. (For example, Tok Pisin is &quot;slowly crowding out&quot; other languages of Papua New Guinea.) 

Much linguistic description, especially the description of languages with few speakers, remains hidden in personal research files or poorly preserved in under-funded archives.

As part of the effort to secure this critical legacy of linguistic diversity, the Long Now Foundation plans a broad online survey and near-permanent physical archive of 1,500 of the approximately 7,000 human languages.

The project has three overlapping goals:

# to create an unprecedented platform for comparative linguistic research and education;
# to develop and widely distribute a functional linguistic tool that might help with the recovery of lost or compromised languages in unknown futures;
# to offer an aesthetic object that suggests the immense diversity of human languages as well as the very real threats to the continued survival of this diversity.

The 1,500-language corpus expands on the parallel-text structure of the original Rosetta Stone through archiving ten descriptive components for each of the 1,500 selected languages.

The goal is an open source &quot;Linux of Linguistics&quot;—an effort of collaborative online scholarship drawing on the expertise and contributions of thousands of academic specialists and native speakers around the world. The project is also organising formal archive research groups at Stanford, Yale, Berkeley, the American Library of Congress, and the American Summer Institute of Linguistics (and its offices in Dallas).

The resulting Rosetta archives are publicly available in three different media:

# a free and continually growing online archive, also available as a DVD;
# a single-volume monumental reference book;
# an extreme-longevity micro-etched disc.

In a direct analogy to its namesake, the Rosetta spacecraft carried a micro-etched pure nickel prototype of the Rosetta disc donated by the Long Now Foundation. The disc was inscribed with 6,500 pages of language translations. The Rosetta spacecraft, with the Rosetta disc launched on 2 March 2004. On 6 August 2014, the spacecraft reached the comet 67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko. On 30 September 2016, the Rosetta spacecraft ended its mission by hard-landing on the comet in its Ma&#x27;at region. The Rosetta disc, Rosetta spacecraft and comet are now all on a 6.44 year orbit around the Sun.

A &quot;Version 1.0&quot; of the HD-Rosetta disc was completed on 3 November 2008. The disc contains over 13,000 pages of information using over 1,500 languages, which can be read after magnifying by 650 times with a microscope.

In early 2017, the Rosetta Wearable Disk was released. It was developed using a similar manufacturing process as the first edition of the Rosetta Disk, the main difference being that the final archive is about in diameter, thus enabling wearing as an ornament on the human body. One side has instructions in eight different languages and scripts (Bahasa Indonesia, English, Hindi, Mandarin, Modern Standard Arabic, Spanish, Swahili, and Russian), and the other an archive of over 1000 human languages assembled in 2016. By November 2017, the initial run of 100 disks had all been sold, but new releases are planned.

<text>Spillers Records, established in 1894, is recognised as the worlds oldest record shop.

==History==
Spillers was founded in 1894 by Henry Spiller at its original location in Queens Arcade, where the shop specialised in the sale of phonographs, wax phonograph cylinders and shellac phonograph discs and also sold and repaired musical instruments. In the early 1920s, Spiller&#x27;s son Edward took over the running of the business and, with the aid of the popular accordionist and bandleader Joe Gregory, sold musical instruments alongside the pre-recorded music. In the late 1940s the shop moved around the corner to a larger premises on The Hayes.

In 2006, the shop&#x27;s future was made uncertain when the site rent was increased by Spillers&#x27; landlords, Helical Bar, who stated that they were keen for the shop to survive. A local campaign to save the shop was initiated, including a petition initiated by Owen John Thomas (then the Assembly Member for South Wales Central) and supported by members of the Welsh Assembly, Manic Street Preachers and Columbia Records. In 2010 Spillers moved to the nearby Morgan Arcade, initially on a temporary basis, with the expectation that the move will be made permanent if successful.

In 2019, Spillers called for a boycott of Morrissey and his music due to his support for a far-right political party.

<text>The Darley Arabian (–1730) was one of three dominant foundation sires of modern Thoroughbred horse racing bloodstock. The other two founders were the Godolphin Arabian and the Byerley Turk. This bay Arabian horse was bought in Aleppo, Syria, by Thomas Darley in 1704 and shipped to Aldby Park in England, as a present for his brother. 

One author in 1840 described Darley Arabian&#x27;s arrival in England during the reign of Queen Anne as the event which &quot;forms the great epoch from which the history of the Turf &quot;[as in &quot;turf racing&quot;]&quot; should be dated&quot;. 

There he stood at stud, usually private but sometimes open to outside mares. He was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1722. By all accounts, the Darley Arabian stood about 15 hands high and was of substantial beauty and refinement.

The Darley Arabian sired the undefeated Flying Childers. He also sired Bartlett&#x27;s Childers, an unraced brother of Flying Childers, who was the great-grandsire of the extremely influential Eclipse. The Darley Arabian was to become the most important sire in the history of the English Thoroughbred. His son Bulle Rock was the first Thoroughbred to be exported to America, in 1730.

Most Thoroughbreds can be traced back to Darley Arabian. In 95% of modern Thoroughbred racehorses, the Y chromosome can be traced back to this single stallion. This is mainly through his descendant, Eclipse, who is the direct male ancestor of 95% of all thoroughbreds and in the pedigree of many of the rest.

<doc id="161771" wikidata="Q1018502" url="?curid=161771" title="Byerley Turk">
<text>The Byerley Turk (), also spelled Byerly Turk, was the earliest of three stallions that were the founders of the modern Thoroughbred horse racing bloodstock (the other two are the Godolphin Arabian and the Darley Arabian).

==Background==
The biographical details of the stallion are the subject of much speculation. The entry in the &quot;General Stud Book&quot; simply states: &quot;&quot;BYERLY TURK, was Captain Byerly&#x27;s charger in Ireland, in King William&#x27;s wars (1689, &amp;c.)&quot;.&quot; As for his earlier history, the most popular theory is that the horse was captured at the Battle of Buda (1686) along with the Lister Turk, who was brought to England by the Duke of Berwick. Other sources speculate he was one of three Turkish stallions captured at the Battle of Vienna. It is even possible he was bred in England from previously imported stock. He was definitely the war horse and cavalry mount of Captain Robert Byerley, who was dispatched to Ireland in 1689 during King William&#x27;s War and saw further military service in the Battle of the Boyne. According to early records, Captain Byerley was nearly captured while reconnoitering the enemy, &quot;owing his safety to the superior speed of his horse&quot;.

As a general rule, the spelling of a name registered with the Jockey Club is considered definitive, even if it is an obvious error. However, the original edition of the &quot;General Stud Book&quot; was compiled nearly a century after the fact (in 1791) and contains several errors that have been subsequently corrected. Most sources consider the correct spelling of the horse&#x27;s name to follow the correct spelling of the owner&#x27;s name, Byerley.

The Byerley Turk was a dark brown or black horse of unknown breeding, but described in historic accounts as an Arabian. At the time, Turkish horses were described as descended from &quot;those of Arabia or Persia&quot;, but stated that they were longer in the body and of a larger size. He was described as a horse of elegance, courage and speed. Many of his offspring were also noted to have been either bay or black.

==Stud record==
In 1692, Captain Byerley married his cousin, Mary Wharton (sole heir to the estate of Goldsborough, near Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, England) and moved to live with her at her family home of Goldsborough Hall. After Byerley retired (as Colonel Byerley), the Byerley Turk retired to stud, first at Middridge Grange, then, from 1697, at Goldsborough Hall. The Byerley Turk died there in 1703 and it is believed he is buried close to the Hall. Goldsborough Hall is now a private family home that offers accommodation, which includes the commemorative Byerley suite.

He did not cover many well-bred mares, but his most significant sons include:

* Black Hearty, black colt born c. 1695, &quot;a famous Horse of Sir George Fletcher&quot;
* Grasshopper or Bristol Grasshopper, c. 1695, won the Town Plate at Nottingham under 10 stone
* Jigg, c. 1701, a bay colt of middling ability who became the sire of Partner, a four-time leading sire. Partner sired Tartar, who was the sire of Herod (1738). Herod founded one of the three sire lines from which all modern Thoroughbreds descend, the other lines being founded by Eclipse and Matchem.
* Basto, a nearly black colt born c. 1704, who won several match races from 1708 to 1710. Basto sired Old Ebony, the foundation mare of family #5.

The Byerley Turk also sired several highly influential daughters, most of whose names do not survive. They are generally classified by the female family that they belong to:
* Byerley Turk mare, a black or brown daughter out of Tarfollet Barb mare, through whom all modern members of family #1 descend. Family 1 is estimated to account for 15% of all thoroughbreds, and has been divided into several sub-families for ease of reference. For example, family 1-k, the family of Frankel among many others, traces back through several branches to family 1-a, Bonny Lass, a grand-daughter of the Byerley Turk mare. As of 2010, there were 33 Epsom Derby winners, 31 St. Leger winners, and 40 winners of The Oaks Stakes listed in family 1 as descendants of the Byerley Turk mare
* Bowes&#x27; Byerley Turk mare, the &quot;Dam of the Two True Blues&quot;, the taproot of family 3. Though not as widespread as family 1, many classic winners around the world trace back to family 3. As of 2010, there were 25 Derby winners, 26 Oaks winners and 20 St Leger winners from family 3
* The Byerley Turk mare out of Bustler Mare, the taproot of family 8, which has produced 7 Oaks winners, 11 Derby winners, and 15 St Leger winners including Nijinsky
* The Byerley Turk mare that was the taproot of family 17, which has produced 2 Oaks and 3 St Leger winners 
* The Byerley Turk mare that was the taproot of family 41

==Byerley Turk sire line==
The Byerley sire line persisted by producing a major sire every few generations, whose sons would create branches of their own. Most of these branches have died out over the course of time in the purebred Thoroughbred, but remain present in other horse breeds in which mares were bred to male descendants of the Byerley Turk. The line of descent to the present day is as follows:
* The Byerley Turk (~1680) sired Jigg in 1705, who sired Partner in 1718, who sired Tartar in 1743, who sired Herod in 1758. Herod was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland from 1777 to 1784.
* Herod sired Highflyer in 1774, leading sire in Great Britain from 1785-1796. Highflyer sired Sir Peter Teazle, who was leading sire in Great Britain from 1799-1802, 1804-1809. Highflyer&#x27;s line persisted for many generations, but died out by the mid-20th century.
* Herod sired Florizel (1768), who sired Diomed (1777). Diomed would become a foundation sire of the American turf. In turn, Diomed sired Sir Archy, who was the first great &quot;sire of sires&quot; in the United States. A few generations later through Sir Archy&#x27;s line came Lexington, who became the leading sire in North America sixteen times in the mid-19th century; his sire line died out in the late 20th century.
*Herod&#x27;s line continued through Woodpecker, foaled in 1773, who sired Buzzard (1787). Buzzard founded several sire lines that flourished in the 19th century, most of which withered away in the 20th century. Two lines through Buzzard survived into the 21st century, Castrel (1801), and Selim (1802). Castrel sired Pantaloon (1824), who sired Windhound (1847), who sired Thormanby (1857), who sired Atlantic (1871), who sired Le Sancy (1884), who sired Le Samaritain (1893), who sired Roi Herode (1904). Roi Herode’s son Royal Canopy (1914) sired Bonn Nuit (1934) who established a Show jumping dynasty that extended to the 21st century through champion show jumper Gem Twist, though that horse was a gelding. Buzzard&#x27;s son Selim was leading sire of 1814. Selim produced a flourishing sire line, most of which died away by the mid 20th century. Selim&#x27;s sire line continued through Sultan, born in 1816. Sultan was leading sire 6 times.

*Sultan in turn sired Bay Middleton (1833), who was leading sire in 1844 and 1849. Bay Middleton sired several sire sons but most of his line died out by the middle of the 20th century. Bay Middleton&#x27;s sire line continued through The Flying Dutchman, born in 1846. The Flying Dutchman sired several sons whose lines gradually died out over the course of the 20th century. The Flying Dutchman&#x27;s line continued through Dollar in 1860, who sired Androcles in 1870, who sired Cambyse in 1884, who sired Gardefeu in 1895, who sired Chouberski in 1902, who sired Bruleur in 1910. Bruleur sired Ksar in 1918.

*Ksar was a two-time winner of the Arc de Triomphe and the leading sire in France for 1931. Ksar sired Tourbillon in 1928. Tourbillon was three-time leading sire in France. As recently as the 1982 stallion register, four sons of Tourbillon were known to have active stallions (Ambiorix, Coaraze, Djebel, and Timor). Tourbillon&#x27;s sire line has not had a stallion in the top 100 turf horses as recently as 2018.
* Djebel sired My Babu, who also won the 2000 Guineas. The My Babu sire line persisted for several generations, leading to Cirrus des Aigles, a Group 1 winner as late as 2014. Unfortunately, Cirrus des Aigles was gelded so the My Babu sire line is on the brink of extinction, though as of 2023, sire Bulleton (Australia, 2003) still serves mares in N.S.W., Australia. His sire is Rubiton, by Century, by Better Boy (Ireland, 1951). Better Boy was 4-time Champion Sire in Australia (1965–66, 1970–71, 1971–72 and 1976–77), Sired 35 stakes winners and was Champion Broodmare Sire in Australia 1978-79. In addition, Japanese horse racing fans have attempted to keep the sire line of Tokai Teio (who is a descendant of My Babu through his son, Milesian) alive by means of crowdfunding, through his son, Quite Fine.
* Djebel also sired Clarion, born in 1944, who, though less successful than My Babu on the track, is the best hope for the survival of the Byerley Turk sire line. Clarion sired Klairon in 1952, whose son Luthier would lead the French sire list four times. Luthier&#x27;s sire line continued for a few generations but seems to have died out. Klairon also sired Lorenzaccio in 1965, who in turn sired Ahonoora in 1975. Ahonoora proved a very successful sire, with offspring including: Don&#x27;t Forget Me (2000 Guineas), Dr Devious (Epsom Derby), and Indian Ridge. The Indian Ridge line has hopes primarily through the lineage of five sons: Compton Place (1994), Indian Rocket (1994), Namid (1996), Linngari (2002), and Luck Money (2005). Pearl Secret (son of Compton Place) is at stud in Japan, Captain Chop (son of Indian Rocket) is at stud in France, Total Gallery (son of Namid) is at stud in India, Linngari is at stud in South Africa, and Luck Money is at stud in Argentina.

Thus, the continuation of the Byerley Turk sire line through Herod in the purebred Thoroughbred now largely depends on the descendants of Djebel, primarily through five descendants of his son Clarion (Pearl Secret, Captain Chop, Linngari, Total Gallery, and Luck Money, via the Indian Ridge line), and secondarily through two descendants of his son My Babu (Bulleton via the Better Boy line, and Quite Fine via the Milesian line).

;Continuation of direct sire line through reporting error
Recent research from 2017 and 2019 has brought into question the lineage of the sire Galopin. The research suggests that Galopin descends, not from the Darley Arabian sire line, but from the Byerley Turk. This is due to the descendants of Galopin possessing the Y chromosome Tb-oB1 rather than Tb-d, which is found in descendants of the Darley Arabian. This line of descent, which is a rare line via sire St. Simon (1881 – 1908), was found to exist as recently as 2023 in Saudi Arabia, from the sons of Pleasant Colony.

;Continuing influence other than direct sire line
Focusing on the sire line may underestimate the ongoing influence of the Byerley Turk; detailed pedigree analysis shows that he has a higher percentage of blood in the modern Thoroughbred than either of his fellow foundation sires through other lines of descent. Thormanby (1857–1875), a Byerley Turk descendant who sired almost 100 stakes winners, is present in the pedigrees of almost all modern Thoroughbreds through his daughter, Rouge Rose, who produced the Epsom Derby winner Bend Or (Darley Arabian line).

===Byerley Turk line in crossbreds===

;United States
The Byerley Turk sire line has carried on in other horse breeds through his direct male descendants such as Diomed (American Quarter Horse and Standardbred), Denmark (American Saddlebred), and Justin Morgan (Morgan horse). Denmark, Justin Morgan, and Sir Archy (son of Diomed), are key foundation sires for their breeds, with over 60% of American Saddlebreds in the early 1900s tracing their lineage back to Denmark son Gaines&#x27; Denmark. 

;Europe
The Kisbér Félvér of Hungary has a direct sire line link to the Byerley Turk. The lineage can be traced to the German-born Thoroughbred stallion Fenék (b. 1883), who was by the British stallion Buccaneer - a descendant of Herod (b. 1758) through Herod&#x27;s son, Highflyer (b. 1774) - out of the mare Hélène Triomphante, of the Godolphin Arabian line. Fenék was transferred to the Kisbér Stud in Hungary in 1894, where he had a stud fee of £30 for foreign-owned mares, and £20 for Hungarian-owned mares.

In the Trakehner, the Byerley Turk also had a major influence. Of the English Thoroughbred stallions who stood at the stud at Trakehnen, some were Byerley Turk sire line descendants, including Snyders (b. 1833), a male-line descendant of Herod (b. 1758); and Perfectionist, a member of the disputed Galopin line. The German Thoroughbred stallion Lehnsherr (b. 1927), a Byerley Turk male-line descendant through Atlantic (1871–1891) through his son, the French Thoroughbred stallion Le Sancy (b. 1884), would also become an influential sire in the Trakehner breed. Chamant (b. 1874), another Byerley Turk descendant, also influenced the Trakehner and the Westphalian.

The Byerley Turk sire line also lives on in Poland through the Anglo-Arabian stallion Ramzes (b. 1937), who was sired by the gray Belgian Thoroughbred stallion Rittersporn (b. 1917) out of the Shagya Arabian mare Jordi. Rittersporn was a male-line descendant of the English Thoroughbred racing stallion Herod (b. 1758) through Herod&#x27;s son, Woodpecker (b. 1773), and Woodpecker&#x27;s son, Buzzard (b. 1787). Ramzes was an influential warmblood sire of show jumping and dressage horses who stood at various studs, including the Janów Podlaski Stud Farm in Poland, and would go on to have a strong influence on the Westphalian, Holsteiner, and other German warmblood breeds. 

The Grand Prix and 1996 Olympic dressage team stallion Rubinstein I (1986 – 2000), a Westphalian, was one of Ramzes&#x27; most influential descendants among German warmblood and sport horse breeders, siring 89 state premium mares and 66 approved stallions. Rubinstein I sired over 400 mares in different German warmblood registries, as well as numerous sons recognized as Oldenburg and Hanoverian stallions. The performances of his get placed him 4th on the dressage index for older stallions. 

Another influential Hanoverian stallion of the Byerley Turk line includes Bolero (1975 – 1987), by the Thoroughbred stallion Black Sky (b. 1966) of the Djebel line, out of the Hanoverian/Thoroughbred mare Baronesse (b. 1970). One of Bolero&#x27;s best-known female descendants was the Hanoverian mare Brentina (1991 – 2021), the first American horse to take the FEI World Cup Final in 2003; made the shortlist for the 2004 Summer Olympics; and was named to the 2006 World Equestrian Games team, earning a bronze medal for the United States.

<text>The Godolphin Arabian (–1753), also known as the Godolphin Barb, was an Arabian horse who was one of three stallions that founded the modern Thoroughbred (the others were the Darley Arabian and the Byerley Turk). He was named after his best-known owner, Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin.

==Origins==
The Godolphin Arabian was foaled about 1724 in Yemen and moved several times before reaching England. At some early age, he was exported, probably via Syria, to the stud of the bey of Tunis. From there he was given to Louis XV of France in 1730. It is believed he was a present from monarch to monarch. Not valued by his new French owner, it is believed he was used as a carthorse.

The horse was then imported from France by Edward Coke and sent to his stud at Longford Hall, Derbyshire, where he remained until the death of his owner in 1733.

He was bequeathed to Roger Williams, &quot;proprietor of the St. James&#x27;s Coffee House&quot;, who inherited Coke&#x27;s stallions. He was bought by the 2nd Earl of Godolphin, and placed at his stud at Wandlebury, Cambridgeshire, until his death on Christmas Day 1753. A stone marks his grave under the archway of the stable block of Wandlebury House.

==Appearance==

The Godolphin Arabian was a bay colour with some white on the off heel behind. He stood at and was distinguished by an unnaturally high crest, which is noticeable from portraits of the horse. Most of his immediate offspring were also bay.

The veterinary surgeon Osmer described the Godolphin Arabian in the following manner,

==Breed controversy==

Controversy exists over the ancestry of this horse; some writers referred to him as a Barb, but Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud concludes that it is most widely believed that he was an Arabian or had primarily Arabian lineage.

&quot;Barb&quot; is a reference to his believed country of origin, Tunisia, on the Barbary Coast. Whyte in the 1840 &quot;History of the British Turf&quot;, refers to the horse as &quot;The Godolphin Barb, or &quot;as he has been improperly called&quot;, the Godolphin Arabian&quot; (emphasis added) before further clarifying, &quot;he was long considered an Arabian, although his points resembled more those of the highest breed of Barbs.&quot; However, portraits showing a horse with a high-carried tail and dished profile, features that differentiate the two types, lead modern experts to believe he was more likely an Arabian. The confusion is understandable, but while the breeds have some characteristics in common and are distantly related, their phenotypes are quite distinct. There was also an argument raised that he was actually a Turkomen, merely called an Arabian in order to raise the stud fee.

The Earl of Godolphin referred to the horse as an Arabian, and he was described as such by the painter George Stubbs. Lord Godolphin later bought a second stallion in 1750. This one he clearly called a &quot;barb&quot;. Both were of a similar bay colour, but the Barb had a star. Godolphin later bought a grey Barb, which has also caused some confusion over the years.

Recent DNA studies disprove the theory that he was a Barb, as his descendants&#x27; Y-DNA traces to the same general haplotype as the Darley Arabian, though to different sub-groups and there are relatively few male-line descendants of the Godolphin Arabian today. This group may have been of Turkoman horse or Arabian origins, as modern horses of both breeds have been linked to this haplotype.

==Breeding career==

The Godolphin Arabian was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1738, 1745 and 1747.

Originally, this small stallion was considered inferior to the larger European horses of the time and was not meant to be put to stud. Instead he was used as &#x27;teaser&#x27;, a stallion used to gauge the mare&#x27;s receptiveness. This changed when Hobgoblin refused to cover the mare Roxana, who was then covered by the Godolphin Arabian.

The result of this mating was Lath, the first of his offspring, who went on to win the Queen&#x27;s Plate nine times out of nine at the Newmarket races. The second colt from this pair was Cade, and the third was Regulus. All three were the same gold-touched bay as their sire, with the same small build and high-crested conformation. All were exceptionally fast on the track, and went on to sire many foals themselves. This was the start of the Godolphin Arabian&#x27;s prowess as a racing stud, and he spent the rest of his days as the Earl of Godolphin&#x27;s prize stallion, bred to England&#x27;s finest mares.

The American connection began with the filly Selima (born in 1745 out of Shireborn). She was purchased by Benjamin Tasker Jr. of the Province of Maryland in Colonial America, carried to the new world, and raced between 1750 and 1753. She won the biggest prize of the era, 2,500 pistoles at Gloucester, Virginia which marked &quot;the beginning of the remarkable racing contests between the rival colonies of Maryland and Virginia.&quot; After this, she became a successful broodmare at the Belair Stud in Collington, Maryland.

The Godolphin Arabian died on the Gog Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire in 1753, aged around 29. The horse&#x27;s grave in the stable block of Wandlebury House can be visited. When he was interred, the occasion was marked with ale and cake.

==Legacy==
Although today the majority of Thoroughbred horses&#x27; sire lines trace to the Darley Arabian, several famous North American horses of the past trace their sire line back to the Godolphin Arabian. These include Seabiscuit, Man o&#x27; War, and War Admiral. Today, the sire line is primarily supported by descendants of Relaunch and his son Cee&#x27;s Tizzy through dual Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic winner Tiznow.

In Europe, his influence survives mainly through the 2,000 Guineas winner Known Fact, and his son, the champion miler Warning. This line has produced outstanding sprinters such as Diktat (Haydock Sprint Cup), Avonbridge and Dream Ahead. The Derby has not been won by a sire line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian since Santa Claus in 1964 and is nowadays dominated by descendants of the Darley Arabian.

The major Thoroughbred sire Eclipse traces in his sire line to the Darley Arabian, but his dam was a daughter of Regulus and thus also traces to the Godolphin Arabian. This pattern continues to be seen today, with the Godolphin Arabian more heavily represented in dam lines and in the &quot;middle&quot; of pedigrees (as opposed to direct sire lines).

Conquérant, a founding stallion of the French Trotter breed, also belonged to the male lineage of the Godolphin Arabian.

==In fiction==
&quot;King of the Wind&quot; (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1948) is a fictional biography of the Godolphin Arabian by American author Marguerite Henry. She wrote many books about horses for children, and perhaps is best known for &quot;Misty of Chincoteague&quot; and its sequels. She won the Newbery Medal for &quot;King of the Wind&quot;, recognizing it as the year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot;. &quot;Misty&quot; became a film in 1961, but &quot;King of the Wind&quot; had to wait till 1990 for its adaptation, with Navin Chowdhry as the Arabian&#x27;s lifetime stable boy Agba.

In the novel, the Godolphin Arabian was foaled in Morocco and was called Sham. He came to Europe as a diplomatic gift to King Louis XV of France but, due to his poor condition on arrival and relatively small size, was given to the cook as a cart horse. He was soon sold to a woodcarter in Paris, where he was treated poorly and then purchased by the Quaker Edward Coke of Holkham Hall, older brother of the 1st Earl of Leicester 5th Creation, then sold to Francis, Earl of Godolphin, who maintained a stud in Suffolk, near the racing town of Newmarket.

<doc id="161773" wikidata="Q210371" url="?curid=161773" title="Kangaroo Island">
<text>Kangaroo Island (, ) is Australia&#x27;s third-largest island, after Tasmania and Melville Island. It lies in the state of South Australia, southwest of Adelaide. Its closest point to the mainland is Snapper Point in Backstairs Passage, which is from the Fleurieu Peninsula.

The native population of Aboriginal Australians that once occupied the island (sometimes referred to as the Kartan people) disappeared from the archaeological record sometime after the land became an island following the rising sea levels associated with the Last Glacial Period around 10,000 years ago. It was subsequently settled intermittently by sealers and whalers in the early 19th century, and from 1836 on a permanent basis during the British colonisation of South Australia.

Since then the island&#x27;s economy has been principally agricultural, with a southern rock lobster fishery and with tourism growing in importance. The largest town, and the administrative centre, is Kingscote. The island has several nature reserves to protect the remnants of its natural vegetation and native animals, with the largest and best-known being Flinders Chase National Park at the western end.

==Description==
The island is long west/east and between from its narrowest to widest north/south points. Its area covers . Its coastline is long, and its highest point of 307 metres (1007 ft) is in Flinders Chase National Park, west of the junction of the Playford and West End Highways. The second highest point is Mount MacDonnell at above sea level. It is separated from Yorke Peninsula to the northwest by Investigator Strait and from Fleurieu Peninsula to the northeast by Backstairs Passage. A group of islets, the Pages, lie off the eastern end of the island.

==History==
===Aboriginal use===
Kangaroo Island separated from mainland Australia around 10,000 years ago, due to rising sea level after the last glacial period. Known as (Karta) Pintingga (&#x27;Island of the Dead&#x27;) by the mainland Aboriginal peoples, the existence of stone tools and shell middens shows that Aboriginal people once lived on Kangaroo Island. It is thought that they occupied it as long ago as 16,000 years before the present and may have only disappeared from the island as recently as 2000 years ago. There is however evidence of the Kartan people on the mainland, for instance at Hallett Cove.

A mainland Aboriginal dreaming story tells of the Backstairs Passage flooding:

&quot;Long ago, Ngurunderi&#x27;s two wives ran away from him, and he was forced to follow them. He pursued them and as he did so he crossed Lake Albert and went along the beach to Cape Jervis. When he arrived there he saw his wives wading half-way across the shallow channel which divided Naroongowie from the mainland. He was determined to punish his wives, and angrily ordered the water to rise up and drown them. With a terrific rush the waters roared and the women were carried back towards the mainland. Although they tried frantically to swim against the tidal wave they were powerless to do so and were drowned.&quot;

===European settlement===

On 23 March 1802, British explorer Matthew Flinders, commanding , named the land &quot;Kanguroo &quot;(sic)&quot; Island&quot;, due to the endemic subspecies of the western grey kangaroo, &quot;Macropus fuliginosus fuliginosus&quot;, after landing near Kangaroo Head on the north coast of the Dudley Peninsula. He was closely followed by the French explorer Commander Nicolas Baudin, who was the first European to circumnavigate the Island and who mapped much of the island (which is why so many areas have French names).

Although the French and the British were at war at the time, the men met peacefully. They both used the fresh water seeping at what is now known as Hog Bay near Frenchman&#x27;s Rock and the site of present-day Penneshaw. Baudin named the Island &quot;Île Borda&quot;, in honour of Jean-Charles de Borda, although the French chart published by Louis de Freycinet after Baudin&#x27;s death referred to the Island as &quot;Île Decres&quot;.

A community of sealers and escaped convicts existed on Kangaroo Island from 1802 to the time of South Australia&#x27;s colonisation in 1836. A sealing gang led by Joseph Murrrell are reported landing at Harvey&#x27;s Return in 1806–07, and they established a camp on the beach. The sealers were rough men and several kidnapped Aboriginal women from Tasmania and mainland South Australia. The women were kept prisoner as wives and virtual slaves. At least two contemporary accounts (Taplin 1867, Bull 1884) report reputed crossings of Backstairs Passage from Kangaroo Island to the mainland by kidnapped women seeking to escape from their captors. &#x27;A fine specimen of her race&#x27; was pointed out to J. W. Bull as having swum the passage in 1835, and a woman and her baby were found dead on the beach after a presumed crossing in 1871. In 1803, sealers from the American brig built the schooner , the first ship built in South Australia, at what is now American River.

In 1812, Richard Siddins reached Kangaroo Island on the , which was engaged in salt harvesting on the island. When she was wrecked later that year, 30 tons of the mineral was recovered from her cargo.

Most ships of the &quot;First Fleet of South Australia&quot; that brought settlers for the new colony first stopped at Nepean Bay. The first was commanded by Captain Robert Clark Morgan on 27 or 28 July 1836; , under Robert Ross, arrived a day or two later. The arrival of the , under John Finlay Duff, in November that year, was notable for the deaths of E. W. Osborne and Dr. John Slater, who perished on an exploratory trek from Cape Borda to Kingscote.

A number of shore-based bay whaling stations operated on the coast in the 1840s. These were located at Doyle&#x27;s Bay, D&#x27;Estrees Bay and Hog Bay.

===Shipwrecks and lighthouses===

Numerous ships have been wrecked on the Kangaroo Island coastline. The earliest was the cutter &quot;William&quot; (20 tons), which was wrecked while trying to enter Hog Bay on 23 August 1847. The largest vessel lost was &quot;Portland Maru&quot; (5,865 tons), which sank at Cape Torrens on 20 March 1935. The greatest loss of life occurred with the wreck of &quot;Loch Sloy&quot; on 24 April 1899 at Maupertuis Bay, when 31 people were drowned, and one initial survivor subsequently perished. Twenty-seven people drowned at West Bay in September 1905, when &quot;Loch Vennachar&quot; was wrecked.

The first lighthouse built was erected at Cape Willoughby in 1852; this was also the first lighthouse to be erected in South Australia. This was followed by the Cape Borda Lightstation in 1858, the Cape du Couedic Lighthouse in 1906 and Cape St Albans Lighthouse in 1908. All lighthouses continue to be operational.

==Economy==
===Townships===
The biggest town on Kangaroo Island is Kingscote. Originally established at Reeves Point on 27 July 1836, it is South Australia&#x27;s first colonial settlement. It was later suggested that Kingscote could serve as the capital of South Australia, but the island&#x27;s resources were insufficient to support such a large community, so the settlement of Adelaide was chosen.

There are several smaller towns on the island. Penneshaw, the second largest town on Kangaroo Island, has a population of around 300 and is located on the north eastern tip of the Dudley Peninsula, on the eastern end of the island. It contains the ferry terminal, which brings most of the visitors to the island, along with all the necessary freight to sustain the local population. Parndana, in the centre of the island, has a population of about 150, but most do not live in the town; they are sprawled within a few kilometres. The historic area to the south-east of the township, known as the Research Centre to locals, was home to the research station that was set up in the 1940s and 1950s to research the viability of agriculture in the area and still has a small settlement of about 20 people.

American River, on the north coast between Kingscote and Penneshaw, has about 300 residents. Penneshaw and Parndana each have basic facilities, including a general store and fuel and are home to hotels. Facilities such as banking and large supermarkets are available in Kingscote and Penneshaw.

===Population===
According to the 2021 Census, the island has a population of 4,894. Population growth has slowed in past years, with the attraction of mainland Australia for younger adults being the key factor. Censuses show the number of residents aged 55 and over increased from 24.1% in 2001 to 29.8% in 2006, 34.9% in 2011, 41% in 2016, and 43.5% in 2021.

===Agriculture===
The economy is mostly agricultural (grapes, honey, wool, meat and grain). Traditionally, sheep grazing has been the key element in agriculture on the Island; however, in recent times, more diverse crops, such as potatoes and canola, have been introduced. Cattle farming has grown as well, with good quality beef cattle being raised in the higher rainfall areas. Tourism and fishing also play significant roles, with the island experiencing over 186,000 visitors per annum, and some of the best southern rock lobster being sourced from the island&#x27;s rugged south coast. Kangaroo Island has South Australia&#x27;s only eucalyptus oil distillery, with oil distilled from the endemic Kangaroo Island narrow leaf mallee.

The future of over 19,000 hectares, which had been planted (or were due to be planted) with blue gum for future harvesting, is now in doubt, following the collapse of Great Southern Plantation Ltd. in May 2009.

===Wine industry===

The island has 30 wine growers and 12 wineries. The first vineyard was planted near Eastern Cove in 1976 and the first wine made in 1982. This was blended with Tolleys Barossa wine and sold from the cellar door of Eastern Cove Wine as KI-Barossa blend. The Florance vineyard was established under supervision of B. Hayes, who produced its first wine – Eastern Cove Cygnet – and introduced it at the University of South Australia in 1990. The wine carried a Kangaroo Island appellation label as first wine 100% of the region.

===Ligurian bees===
Kangaroo Island is noted for its honey and its Ligurian honey bees. The island has the world&#x27;s only pure-bred and disease-free population of this type of bee. The exporting of pure-bred queen bees is a notable industry for the island. For this reason, there are significant quarantine restrictions on bringing bee products and bee-handling equipment onto the island.

&quot;The Advertiser&quot;, 24 December 1883, reported &quot;A few weeks since the Chamber of Manufactures forwarded an order to Mr. Carroll, a bee master, near Brisbane, for a swarm of Ligurian bees.&quot; &quot;The American Bee Journal&quot;, 25 November 1885, stated &quot;Several pure colonies were reared from this one, [the first hive from Queensland] and two of them were sent to Kangaroo Island, where they appear to thrive well.&quot; An almost word perfect report in the &quot;British Bee Journal&quot;, 1 November 1885, added &quot;They came from the apiary of Mr. Chas. Fullwood.&quot;

A. E. Bonney quickly commenced queen bee breeding near Adelaide at his Upper Kensington apiary in January 1884. In the &quot;South Australian Advertiser&quot;, 7 March 1884, Bonney stated &quot;About three weeks ago I divided the original colony, and the Chamber of Manufactures now possesses three good swarms of Ligurians; two of these will probably be ready to send out towards the end of the month.&quot; And on 9 May 1884 &quot;To show that I think highly of the Ligurians, I may say that in March I imported two more colonies from Queensland. … During Easter holidays Mr Justice Boucaut took one queen [bred and mated in Adelaide] in a full colony to Mr Buick, of American River, Kangaroo Island.&quot; From the South Australian Advertiser, 1 August 1884 &quot;On June 25 the original hive of Ligurian bees, imported by the chamber from Queensland, was sent safely to Mr Turner, at Smith&#x27;s Bay, Kangaroo Island.&quot;

===Tourism===

Kangaroo Island is one of South Australia&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, attracting over 140,000 visitors each year, with international visitors, primarily from Europe, accounting for more than 25% of these visits. There were 114 businesses operating in the sector in June 2016 and the visitor expenditure reached $123 million in December 2017. The expenditure is expected to reach the mark of $168 million by December 2020. Some of the most popular tourist spots are:
* Seal Bay Conservation Park with ranger guided walks among basking Australian sea lions.
* Flinders Chase National Park which includes Remarkable Rocks, Admiral&#x27;s Arch, lighthouses at Cape Borda and Cape du Couedic, and multiple walking trails and camping areas.
* Cape Willoughby
* Kelly Hill Caves
* Little Sahara, huge sand dunes on the south coast.
* The lookout Mount Thisby (officially designated Prospect Hill in 2002 to honour Matthew Flinders&#x27; original naming) with a 360-degree view around the island.
* Murray Lagoon with its abundant aquatic bird life.
* The Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park at Duncan includes local wildlife like koalas, kangaroos, little penguins and reptiles, but also animals such as brown capuchin monkeys, common marmosets, dingoes, meerkats and serval.
* Kangaroo Island Penguin Centre (formerly Kangaroo Island Marine Centre) at Kingscote is now closed but a local tour operator, Kangaroo Island Hire a Guide, is still organising nocturnal tours from Kingscote.
* Raptor Domain (In-flight bird of prey presentation and reptile show)
* The Hanson Bay Wildlife Sanctuary koala walk and Nocturnal tour offer visitors a chance to see the local wildlife.
* A number of farms that sell honey from the Ligurian bees
* The Emu Ridge Eucalyptus Oil Distillery which manufactures eucalyptus oil using a very old furnace
Kangaroo Island is also considered to be one of South Australia&#x27;s best locations for scuba diving, with many popular locations along the north coast. Many of South Australia&#x27;s iconic marine species can be seen there, including the Leafy seadragon. Penneshaw jetty is known for its Gorgonian corals and there are many other timber jetties and shipwrecks that can be dived and enjoyed around the island.

===Local government===
The Kangaroo Island Council provides local government for the entire island and was formed in 1996, following amalgamation of the previous District Councils of Kingscote and Dudley. Kangaroo Island is in the federal Division of Mayo and in the state Electoral district of Mawson.

A 2005 enquiry into the financial sustainability of local government in South Australia determined that 26 out of 68 councils in South Australia were considered unsustainable in the long term. Among these was Kangaroo Island Council, due to its large land area, extensive road network, low population and high tourism visitation. A long term financial plan adopted by council included a rate increase of 2% above CPI for the ten years from 2010.

On 13 May 2010, a development plan was authorised, representing a comprehensive review of Kangaroo Island&#x27;s planning regulations.

===Lifestyle===

Safe swimming is possible on the northern beaches, such as Emu Bay, Stokes Bay or Snellings Beach, and at Island Beach on the Dudley Peninsula. The south coast has dangerous undertows and is more suitable for stronger and experienced swimmers only. An ocean pool with easy shore and pontoon access exists at Kingscote and is free to use.

====Sports====
The island is home to the Kangaroo Island Football League and has several other organised sporting competitions.

===Electricity supply===
Kangaroo Island is connected to the main South Australian power grid by a pair of 33 kV subsea cables across Backstairs Passage. The original 30-year-old 10,000 kVA cable was retained when the second cable, with double its capacity, was laid in 2018 at a cost of $45 million.

Before the new cable was commissioned, University of Technology Sydney conducted a study to assess the viability of renewable energy technology being used to independently generate the island&#x27;s power with a combination of wind, solar and biomass. Although the study concluded that it was indeed possible for the island to sustainably produce its own power for around the same price as the new cable, SA Power Networks ultimately decided against the idea.

The Kangaroo Island power station has three 2 MWe Caterpillar 3516B diesel generators capable of providing a combined 6 MW through the Kingscote substation to provide stability of supply if the submarine cables are unavailable.

==Transport==
===Sea transport===
Kangaroo Island is reliant on ferry services for the majority of its transport to and from the mainland. Ferry services are currently provided by two companies, Kangaroo Island SeaLink which uses two ferries, the &quot;Sealion 2000&quot; and the &quot;Spirit of Kangaroo Island&quot;, to provide freight and passenger services, and Kangaroo Island Connect, which commenced services in June 2018 and provides passenger services only.

From 1907 to 1961, was the prime freight and passenger vessel operating between Port Adelaide and Kingscote.

Following withdrawal from service of &quot;Karatta&quot;, RW Miller operated the MV &quot;Troubridge&quot;, in later years as a joint venture with the South Australian Government. &quot;Troubridge&quot; was a roll on, roll off vessel of 1,996 tons, which used specially designed loading gantries at Port Adelaide, Port Lincoln and Kingscote.

&quot;Troubridge&quot; operated until 1 June 1987, when it was replaced by the Government run A$23 million &quot;Island Seaway&quot;. Built locally in Port Adelaide by Eglo Engineering, &quot;Island Seaway&quot; used the same loading platforms as &quot;Troubridge&quot;. &quot;Island Seaway&quot; was severely criticised as being unsuitable for the Backstairs Passage crossing. Seventy-five sheep and cattle died on the inaugural trip due to carbon monoxide poisoning, and the ship was once described as &#x27;steering like a shopping trolley&#x27;. The vessel subsequently underwent a A$1 million refit of its propulsion system in September 1989 which improved its reliability.

&quot;Island Seaway&quot; began to experience competition from Kangaroo Island SeaLink which began services from Cape Jervis to Penneshaw in 1989. SeaLink acquired the ferry service originally introduced by Peter March. His &quot;Philanderer Ferries&quot; pioneered the crossing from Cape Jervis to Penneshaw, with &quot;Philanderer 3&quot; being a passenger and vehicle carrying catamaran style vessel. In the 1980s, two passenger only services, &quot;Hydroflite H33&quot;, and &quot;Islander&quot;, operated for a short time from Glenelg to Kingscote.

SeaLink has outlasted several competing companies since it began operations. Boat Torque, a Western Australian company, operated &quot;Superflyte&quot; from 1994 until 1997, sailing from Glenelg to Kingscote. Kangaroo Island Ferries had a short-lived venture with &quot;SeaWay&quot;, which travelled from Wirrina Cove to Kingscote from September 2004 until February 2005. &quot;SeaWay&quot; could not handle rough weather as well as SeaLink vessels which impacted the service&#x27;s reliability. Under different proprietorship, &quot;SeaWay&quot; recommenced services in August 2007. However, in May 2008, the operator of &quot;SeaWay&quot; announced suspension of services until October 2008, citing increased fuel prices. In June 2008 the &quot;SeaWay&#x27;s&quot; operating company was placed in administration and the vessel advertised for sale.

With the introduction by SeaLink of the &quot;Island Navigator&quot;, the fate of &quot;Island Seaway&quot; was sealed, with the service subsequently withdrawn and SeaLink drawing on Government subsidies to operate all freight services to and from the Island. SeaLink now holds a virtual monopoly on sea transport to Kangaroo Island, primarily due to its long term lease of the Cape Jervis berth. Sealink&#x27;s agreement with the SA Government, expiring in 2024, precludes other operators from using the Cape Jervis facility for one hour before, and one hour after any scheduled SeaLink service. Kangaroo Island residents have expressed displeasure with the exclusive arrangement granted to SeaLink.

===Air transport===
Guinea Airways operated the first commercial service to Kangaroo Island, commencing in the 1930s. In 1959, the airline was acquired by Airlines of South Australia (ASA), a subsidiary of Ansett. The airline&#x27;s final service was on 4 April 1986. ASA primarily operated Convairs, Douglas DC-3 and Fokker F-27 aircraft. A Piaggio P.166 was used infrequently in the 1970s, whilst Rossair operated Cessna 402s in an arrangement with ASA to replace the F27s in off-peak times.

Following the withdrawal of ASA, Kendell Airlines (another Ansett subsidiary), operated 19-seat Fairchild Metroliners and 34-seat SAAB aircraft to the Island. Upon Ansett&#x27;s ultimate demise in 2002, Regional Express (Rex) acquired the Kendell aircraft and continued services to Kingscote Airport until early 2020, when it ceased operation citing competition from Qantas

In competition with the larger aircraft, and generally with more flexible timetables, a succession of smaller airlines from the 1970s tried with varying success to maintain a &#x27;second string&#x27; presence. Island Air and Pagas operated briefly in the 1970s, whilst the most successful, Emu Airways, commenced in 1980 and made its final flight in November 2005. Emu flew Piper Chieftain aircraft to Kingscote, American River, Penneshaw and Parndana, before air regulations dictated abandonment of all airstrips except Kingscote. Air Kangaroo Island (formerly Air Transit), flew Cessna 402s to the Island in the 1990s.

From 1986 to 1990, Lloyd Aviation operated Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante aircraft, before flying the Short 330. For several years in the 1980s, Commodore Airlines (eventually becoming State Air) offered another alternative service. QantasLink briefly operated a service after the demise of Emu Airways, commencing 18 December 2005, but withdrew less than six months later. QantasLink also operated direct flights from Kangaroo Island to Melbourne, the first time the route was operated. In January 2007, Air South commenced four services daily using Titan nine seat aircraft, but ceased flights in October 2009.

In June 2017, Qantas announced direct Qantaslink flights to Kangaroo Island from Adelaide and Melbourne from December 2017, offering five flights a week from Adelaide over the peak summer months, reducing to three flights a week after Easter, and two flights a week from Melbourne over the peak tourist season in December and January. An $18 million upgrade of the Kingscote Airport was completed in May 2018.

=== Rail transport ===

Around 1938, the Salt Company on Kangaroo Island used a rail tractor built by W. Day &amp; Sons of South Melbourne to transport salt on a short narrow gauge railway between its factory and the port in Muston. Salt was obtained from Muston Lake, White Lagoon, Salt Lagoon and smaller lagoons near Kingscote. It was sold to domestic and industrial users, e.g. for fish and meat preservation and tanning. The salt exports from Kangaroo Island to Adelaide rose from 13 tons in 1843 to 20,000 tons in 1913. Plans for further railway lines did not pass the planning stage.

==Environment==
===Climate===

Having a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;), the winters between June and September are mild and wet, the summers usually warm and dry. Tempered by the ocean, particularly on the coastline, maximum temperatures in summer rarely exceed .

Average temperatures in August range between and in February, the hottest month, between .

Between May and September the island receives two-thirds of its annual rainfall, varying from in Kingscote to around near Roo Lagoon on the top of the central plateau. The wettest month is July.

Nearly half of the island has never been cleared of vegetation, and a quarter of it is conserved in National Parks, Conservation Parks, and five Wilderness Protection Areas. The main protected areas are:
* Flinders Chase National Park
* Seal Bay Conservation Park
* Cape Gantheaume Conservation Park
* Cape Bouguer Wilderness Protection Area
* Ravine des Casoars Wilderness Protection Area

Because of its isolation from mainland Australia, foxes and rabbits are absent from and prohibited from entering the island.

The Kangaroo Island kangaroo, Rosenberg&#x27;s sand goanna, southern brown bandicoot, tammar wallaby, common brushtail possum, short-beaked echidna, Australian sea lion and long-nosed fur seal are native to the island, as well as six bat and frog species. The sole endemic vertebrate species is a small marsupial carnivore, the Kangaroo Island dunnart.

Feral cats are a major threat to endangered endemic native fauna, including the Kangaroo Island dunnart, the
Kangaroo Island echidna, and the Southern brown bandicoot. And also, because of their ability to spread livestock diseases such as Sarcocystis and Toxoplasmosis, a program to eradicate an estimated population of between 3,000 and 5,000 cats within 15 years was started in 2016. Then mayor Peter Clements said: &quot;We have to reach a point where we don&#x27;t have any cats on this island. The feral cat is an apex predator. It is ruining our species here on the island and we are totally committed to eliminating all cats.&quot; Registration and microchipping of cats is mandatory.

The koala, common ringtail possum and platypus have been introduced and still survive there. The introduced koalas have flourished, to the degree that their preferred food source, the manna gum, is at risk of local extinction. The idea of a cull of the burgeoning koala numbers is distasteful to the public, and the state government prefers to use sterilisation for population control. Although chlamydophila pneumoniae is widespread in most koala populations, the disease is not present on Kangaroo Island due to its isolation from other colonies.

====Conflict between conservation and development====
Conservation interests have come into conflict with proponents of various development proposals made since the 2000s. These include a helipad in the island&#x27;s south-western wilderness, a southern bluefin tuna pen on the north coast of the island (which resulted in the withdrawal of the proposal), The Cliffs Golf Resort near Pennington Bay (for which Crown land was considered for private sale or lease to developers) and a port proposal at Smith Bay to facilitate timber exports and cruise ship visitation.

===Birds===

An endemic species of emu, the Kangaroo Island emu, became extinct between 1802 and 1836. The island is the last South Australian refuge of an endangered subspecies of the glossy black cockatoo (&quot;Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus&quot;).

====Kangaroo Island Important Bird Area====
Kangaroo Island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of the vulnerable fairy tern, the near threatened bush stone-curlew, hooded plover and western whipbird, and the biome-restricted rock parrot and purple-gaped honeyeater. It also supports over 1% of the world populations of Cape Barren geese, black-faced cormorants, Pacific gulls and pied oystercatchers, and sometimes of musk ducks, blue-billed ducks, freckled ducks, Australian shelducks, chestnut teals and banded stilts.

====Little penguin colonies====
Little penguin colonies at Penneshaw and Kingscote can be accessed by joining guided nocturnal tours. Both colonies are currently in decline. Several colonies elsewhere on the island are believed to now be extinct, or contain only &#x27;a few&#x27; birds. Historic colonies on Kangaroo Island include Cape Gantheaume, Ravine des Casoars and Harvey&#x27;s Return. In 1950 and 1972, author Mervinia Masterman claimed that little penguins could be found at Flinders Chase in &quot;thousands&quot;. She described the population utilizing the limestone caves at Ravine de Casoars as &quot;innumerable&quot; and described watching &quot;dozens&quot; come ashore at Sandy Beach. Penguins were also present at Hanson Bay on the island&#x27;s south coast in the 1950s.

The decline of penguin populations has prompted expanded monitoring regimes from 2011 to the present. The 2013 Kangaroo Island little penguin census revealed that numbers had decreased by 44 to 100 percent at all surveyed colonies over the prior two years. The census included eight survey sites.

===Fires===
====2007 bushfires====
Lightning strikes on Thursday 6 December 2007 caused several fires on the Island. Before being contained on 16 December 2007, over 20% of the Island had been burnt, totaling , principally within National Park and Conservation Reserves.

The most serious outbreak occurred in Flinders Chase National Park, with 630 square kilometres (or 85% of the total park area) having been burnt.

====2020 bushfires====

In January 2020, the island was one of many places nationwide affected by bushfire as part of the 2019–2020 Australian bushfire season.

Across Kangaroo Island, several fires burnt in excess of , about 52 percent of the island. A bushfire emergency warning was issued on 3 January 2020 as the fire advanced towards Vivonne Bay, and the town of was evacuated. The fires were not declared contained until 21 January.

Two people died on Kangaroo Island due to the fires. A number of wildlife species, some unique to Kangaroo Island and some already endangered before the 2019–2020 bushfires, might be facing extinction in the wild as a result of the fires. Among these, an estimated 80% of the previously 50,000 koalas living on the island died in the fires.

The Flinders Chase National Park was again damaged in the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season.

===Fossils===

The northern coast of Kangaroo Island contains important fossil-bearing deposits, dating from the late Lower Cambrian, such as the Emu Bay Shale (late Botomian, 517 million years old). A variety of primordial marine arthropods left their remains in this Burgess shale type preservation, but the larger grain size of the Emu Bay rock means that the quality of preservation is lower.

A few genera of non-biomineralized arthropods, among them &quot;Squamacula&quot;, &quot;Kangacaris&quot;, and the megacheiran &quot;Tanglangia&quot;, are known only from the Emu Bay Shale and Chengjiang. The site is also the source of magnificent specimens of trilobites such as &quot;Redlichia takooensis&quot;, &quot;Emuella polymera&quot;, &quot;Balcoracania dailyi&quot;, &quot;Megapharanaspis nedini&quot;, &quot;Holyoakia simpsoni&quot;, and &quot;Estaingia (=Hsuaspis) bilobata&quot;. &quot;Balcoracania&quot; and &quot;Emuella&quot; are the only known genera of the distinctive &quot;Redlichiina&quot; family &quot;Emuellidae&quot;, known for possessing the greatest number of thoracic segments known for Trilobita as a whole (a record of 103 in one &quot;Balcoracania&quot; specimen), and so far entirely restricted to Australia and Antarctica.

The depositional environment of the majority of Burgess-Shale-type assemblages is outer shelf, deeper water. The Emu Bay Shale in contrast, appears to represent deposition in restricted basins on the inner shelf, indicating that soft tissue preservation occurred in a range of environmental settings during the Cambrian. Some Emu Bay fossils display extensive mineralization of soft tissues, most often of blocky apatite or fibrous calcium carbonate, including the oldest phosphatized muscle tissue – along with records from Sirius Passet in Greenland, the first thus far reported from the Cambrian. Mid-gut glands are preserved three-dimensionally in calcium phosphate in the arthropods &quot;Isoxys&quot; and &quot;Oestokerkus&quot;, as in related species from the Burgess Shale.

Pleistocene fossilised footprints indicate extinct Australian megafauna, such as diprotodons, short faced kangaroos, and thylacines were once distributed on the island.

==In film==
The 2024 drama feature film &quot;Kangaroo Island&quot;, directed by Tim Piper/Timothy David and written by his wife Sally Gifford, was filmed on the island. It has its world premiere on the closing night of the 2024 Adelaide Film Festival on 3 November 2024.

<text>Beerenberg is a stratovolcano dominating the northeastern end of the Norwegian island of Jan Mayen. It is high and is the world&#x27;s northernmost subaerial active volcano and the only active volcano in Norway. The volcano is topped by a mostly ice-filled crater about wide, with numerous peaks along its rim including the highest summit, Haakon VII Toppen, on its western side.

== Name ==
Its name is Dutch for &quot;Bear Mountain&quot; and comes from the polar bears seen there by Dutch whalers in the early 17th century.

== Description ==
The upper slopes of the volcano are largely ice-covered, with several major glaciers including five which reach the sea. The longest of the glaciers is the Weyprecht Glacier, which flows from the summit crater via a breach through the northwestern portion of the crater rim, and extends about down to the sea.

Beerenberg is composed primarily of basaltic lava flows with minor amounts of tephra. Numerous cinder cones have been formed along slope fissures.

== History ==
There was an Austrian attempt to reach the summit of Beerenberg, presumably whilst the Austrians had a weather station on the island in 1882–83, but the attempt failed due to poor weather. The first recorded ascent was in the summer of 1921, by an expedition led by Dr. Paul Louis Mercanton, joined by James Wordie, T.C. Lethbridge and three others. The British expedition was taken to the island by the Norwegian meteorological service, which was establishing a wireless station on the island.

Its most recent eruptions took place in 1970 and 1985, both of which were flank eruptions from fissures on the northeast side of the mountain. Other eruptions with historical records occurred in 1732, 1818, and 1851.

<text>Upernavik is a small town in the Avannaata municipality in northwestern Greenland, located on a small island of the same name. With 1,064 inhabitants as of 2024, it is the twelfth-largest town in Greenland. It contains the Upernavik Museum.

== History ==

The town was founded as Upernavik in 1772. From the former name of its island, it was sometimes known as Women&#x27;s Island; its name was also sometimes Anglicized to &quot;Uppernavik&quot;.

In 1824, the Kingittorsuaq Runestone was found outside the town. It bears runic characters left by Norsemen, probably from the late 13th century. The runic characters list the names of three Norsemen and mention the construction of a rock cairn nearby.

This is the furthest north that any Norse artifacts have been found, other than those small artifacts that could have been carried north by Inuit traders, and marks the northern known limit of Viking exploration.

Sailors searching for lost polar expeditions sometimes used the city as a staging ground.

==Transport==
Upernavik is served by Air Greenland, with scheduled flights from Upernavik Airport to Qaanaaq, Qaarsut, and Ilulissat. Most settlements in the archipelago are served during weekdays with the Bell 212 helicopter.

AUL ferries have ceased passenger services north of Ilulissat, leaving Upernavik totally dependent on Air Greenland services, which are frequently cancelled due to weather conditions. Cargo arrives several times a year on Royal Arctic Line when sea ice permits, usually beginning in early to mid May annually.

== Archipelago ==
Upernavik is located within Upernavik Archipelago, a vast archipelago of small islands on the coast of northeastern Baffin Bay. The archipelago extends from the northwestern coast of Sigguup Nunaa peninsula in the south at approximately to the southern end of Melville Bay () in the north at approximately .

== Population ==

With 1,092 inhabitants as of 2020, Upernavik is the third-largest town in the Avannaata municipality. The population has been relatively stable over the last two decades and has increased by more than 28% relative to the 1990 levels, with migrants from the smaller settlements in the archipelago helping keep the population level stable. Cyclist Hanne Malmberg was born in Upernavik. She represented Denmark at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Climate==
Upernavik has a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;ET&quot;). Winters are very cold and snowy and summers are quite cool. With a mean of just in July, trees are unable to grow. Autumn and winter are the wettest time of the year and spring is the driest.

<text>The Royal Academy of Arts (RA) is an art institution based in Burlington House in Piccadilly in London, England. Founded in 1768, it has a unique position as an independent, privately funded institution led by eminent artists and architects. Its purpose is to promote the creation, enjoyment and appreciation of the fine arts through exhibitions, education and debate.

==History==

The origin of the Royal Academy of Arts lies in an attempt in 1755 by members of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, principally the sculptor Henry Cheere, to found an autonomous academy of arts. Prior to this a number of artists were members of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, including Cheere and William Hogarth, or were involved in small-scale private art academies, such as the St Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy. Although Cheere&#x27;s attempt failed, the eventual charter, called an &#x27;Instrument&#x27;, used to establish the Royal Academy of Arts over a decade later was almost identical to that drawn up by Cheere in 1755.

The success of St Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy led to the formation of the Society of Artists of Great Britain and the Free Society of Artists. Sir William Chambers, a prominent architect and head of the British government&#x27;s architects&#x27; department, the Office of Works, used his connections with King George III to gain royal patronage and financial support for the Academy. The Royal Academy of Arts was founded through a personal act of King George III on 10 December 1768 with a mission &quot;to establish a school or academy of design for the use of students in the arts&quot; with an annual exhibition.
The painter Joshua Reynolds was made its first president, and Francis Milner Newton was elected the first secretary, a post he held for two decades until his resignation in 1788.

The instrument of foundation, signed by George III on 10 December 1768, named 34 founder members and allowed for a total membership of 40. The founder members were Reynolds, John Baker, George Barret, Francesco Bartolozzi, Giovanni Battista Cipriani, Augustino Carlini, Charles Catton, Mason Chamberlin, William Chambers, Francis Cotes, George Dance, Nathaniel Dance, Thomas Gainsborough, John Gwynn, Francis Hayman, Nathaniel Hone the Elder, Angelica Kauffman, Jeremiah Meyer, George Michael Moser, Mary Moser, Francis Milner Newton, Edward Penny, John Inigo Richards, Paul Sandby, Thomas Sandby, Dominic Serres, Peter Toms, William Tyler, Samuel Wale, Benjamin West, Richard Wilson, Joseph Wilton, Richard Yeo, Francesco Zuccarelli. William Hoare and Johann Zoffany were added to this list by the King in 1769.
The Royal Academy was initially housed in cramped quarters in Pall Mall, although in 1771 it was given temporary accommodation for its library and schools in Old Somerset House, then a royal palace. In 1780 it was installed in purpose-built apartments in the first completed wing of New Somerset House, located in the Strand and designed by Chambers, the Academy&#x27;s first treasurer. The Academy moved in 1837 to Trafalgar Square, where it occupied the east wing of the recently completed National Gallery (designed by another Academician, William Wilkins). These premises soon proved too small to house both institutions. In 1868, 100 years after the Academy&#x27;s foundation, it moved to Burlington House, Piccadilly, where it remains.

The first Royal Academy exhibition of contemporary art, open to all artists, opened on 25 April 1769 and ran until 27 May 1769. 136 works of art were shown and this exhibition, now known as the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, has been staged annually without interruption to the present day. Following the cessation of a similar annual exhibition at the British Institution, the Academy expanded its exhibition programme to include a temporary annual loan exhibition of Old Masters in 1870.

Britain&#x27;s first public lectures on art were staged by the Royal Academy, as another way to fulfil its mission. Led by Reynolds, the first president, the first program included a lecture by William Hunter.

In 2018, the Academy&#x27;s 250th anniversary, the results of a major refurbishment were unveiled. The project began on 1 January 2008 with the appointment of David Chipperfield Architects. Heritage Lottery Fund support was secured in 2012. On 19 October 2016 the RA&#x27;s Burlington Gardens site was closed to the public and renovations commenced. Refurbishment work included the restoration of 150 sash windows, glazing upgrades to 52 windows and the installation of two large roof lights. The &quot;New RA&quot; was opened to the public on 19 May 2018. The £56 million development includes new galleries, a lecture theatre, a public project space for students and a bridge linking the Burlington House and Burlington Gardens sites. As part of the process 10,000 works from the RA&#x27;s collection were digitised and made available online.

==Activities==

=== Charitable status ===

The Royal Academy receives funding from neither the State nor the Crown, and operates as a charity. The RA&#x27;s home in Burlington House is owned by the UK government and provided to the Academy on a peppercorn rent leasehold of 999 years.

=== Permanent collection and loans ===
One of its principal sources of revenue is hosting a programme of temporary loan exhibitions. These are comparable to those at the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery and leading art galleries outside the United Kingdom. In 2004 the highlights of the Academy&#x27;s permanent collection went on display in the newly restored reception rooms of the original section of Burlington House, which are now known as the John Madejski Fine Rooms.

=== Exhibitions ===
Under the direction of former exhibitions secretary Sir Norman Rosenthal, the Academy has hosted ambitious exhibitions of contemporary art. In its 1997 &quot;Sensation&quot;, it displayed the collection of work by Young British Artists owned by Charles Saatchi. The show was controversial for its display of Marcus Harvey&#x27;s portrait of Myra Hindley, a convicted murderer. The painting was vandalised while on display.

In 2004, the Academy attracted media attention for a series of financial scandals and reports of a feud between Rosenthal and other senior staff. These problems resulted in the cancellation of what were expected to have been profitable exhibitions. In 2006, it attracted the press by erroneously placing only the support for a sculpture on display, and then justifying it being kept on display. 

From 3 February to 28 April 2024, the RA shows the exhibition &quot;Entangled Pasts, 1768-now&quot; in order to reveal and discuss &quot;connections between art associated with the Royal Academy of Arts and Britain&#x27;s colonial histories.&quot; However, according to Colin Grant, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the exhibition &quot;appears to be tame&quot; though it attempts to &quot;critique the exclusive and impenetrable RA.&quot;

=== Summer Exhibition ===

The Academy hosts the Summer Exhibition an annual open art exhibition, which means anyone can enter their work to be considered for exhibition. Established in 1769, it is the oldest and largest open submission exhibition in the world and is included in London&#x27;s Social Season. The members of The Academy, also known as Royal Academicians select and hang the works. Art works in a variety of media are exhibited including painting, sculpture, film, architecture, photography and printmaking.

Tracey Emin exhibited in the 2005 show. In March 2007 Emin accepted the Academy&#x27;s invitation to become a Royal Academician, commenting in her weekly newspaper column that, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean that I have become more conformist; it means that the Royal Academy has become more open, which is healthy and brilliant.&quot;

=== Friends programme ===
In 1977, Sir Hugh Casson founded the Friends of the Royal Academy, a charity designed to provide financial support for the institution.

=== Literary collaborations ===
Pin Drop Studio hosts live events where well-known authors, actors and thinkers read a short story chosen as a response to the main exhibition programme. The literary evenings are hosted by Pin Drop Studio founder Simon Oldfield. Guests have included Graham Swift, Sebastian Faulks, Lionel Shriver, William Boyd, Will Self, Dame Eileen Atkins, Dame Siân Phillips, Lisa Dawn and Ben Okri.

The RA and Pin Drop Short Story Award is an open submission writing prize, held annually along similar principles of the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. The award ceremony features a live reading of the winning story in its entirety by a special guest. Past winning stories have been read by Stephen Fry, Dame Penelope Wilton, Juliet Stevenson and Gwendoline Christie.

==Presidents and officers==

On 10 December 2019, Rebecca Salter was elected the first female President of the Royal Academy on the retirement of Sir Christopher Le Brun.

In September 2007, Sir Charles Saumarez Smith became Secretary and Chief Executive of the Royal Academy, a newly created post. Saumarez Smith stepped down from the role at the end of 2018, and it was announced that Axel Rüger, director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, would fill the position from June 2019.

==Royal Academy Schools==
The Royal Academy Schools form the oldest art school in Britain, and have been an integral part of the Royal Academy of Arts since its foundation in 1768. A key principle of the RA Schools is that their three-year post graduate programme is free of charge to every applicant offered a place. 

The Royal Academy Schools was the first institution to provide professional training for artists in Britain. The Schools&#x27; programme of formal training was modelled on that of the French Académie de peinture et de sculpture, founded by Louis XIV in 1648. It was shaped by the precepts laid down by Sir Joshua Reynolds. In his fifteen &quot;Discourses&quot; delivered to pupils in the Schools between 1769 and 1790, Reynolds stressed the importance of copying the Old Masters, and of drawing from casts after the Antique and from the life model. He argued that such a training would form artists capable of creating works of high moral and artistic worth. Professorial chairs were founded in Chemistry, Anatomy, Ancient History and Ancient Literature, the latter two being held initially by Samuel Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith.

In 1769, the first year of operation, the Schools enrolled 77 students. By 1830 more than 1,500 students had enrolled in the Schools, an average intake of 25 students each year. They included men such as John Flaxman, J. M. W. Turner, John Soane, Thomas Rowlandson, William Blake, Thomas Lawrence, Decimus Burton, John Constable, George Hayter, David Wilkie, William Etty, Edwin Landseer, and Charles Lucy in 1838. The first woman to enrol as a student of the Schools was Laura Herford in 1860, and other female students have included Daisy Radcliffe Beresford. Charles Sims was expelled from the Schools in 1895. The Royal Academy made Sir Francis Newbolt the first Honorary Professor of Law in 1928.

In 2011 Tracey Emin was appointed Professor of Drawing, and Fiona Rae was appointed Professor of Painting – the first women professors to be appointed in the history of the Academy. Emin was succeeded by Michael Landy, and then David Remfry in 2016 while Rae was succeeded by Chantal Joffe in January 2016.

==Library, archive, and collections==
The first president of the Royal Academy, Sir Joshua Reynolds, gave his noted self-portrait, beginning the Royal Academy collection. This was followed by gifts from other founding members, such as Gainsborough and Benjamin West. Subsequently, each elected Member was required to donate an artwork (known as a &quot;Diploma Work&quot;) typical of his or her artistic output, and this practice continues today. Additional donations and purchases have resulted in a collection of approximately a thousand paintings and a thousand sculptures, which show the development of a British School of art. The Academy&#x27;s collection of works on paper includes significant holdings of drawings and sketchbooks by artists working in Britain from the mid-18th century onwards, including George Romney, Lord Leighton and Dame Laura Knight.

The photographic collection consists of photographs of Academicians, landscapes, architecture and works of art. Holdings include early portraits by William Lake Price dating from the 1850s, portraits by David Wilkie Wynfield and Eadweard Muybridge&#x27;s &quot;Animal Locomotion&quot; (1872–85).

===Wall and ceiling paintings===
Among the paintings decorating the walls and ceilings of the building are those of Benjamin West and Angelica Kauffman, in the entrance hall (Hutchison 1968, p. 153), moved from the previous building at Somerset House. In the centre is West&#x27;s roundel &quot;The Graces Unveiling Nature&quot;, , surrounded by panels depicting the elements, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. At each end are mounted two of Kauffman&#x27;s circular paintings, &quot;Composition&quot; at the west end, and &quot;Painting or Colour&quot; and &quot;Genius or Invention&quot; at the east end.

===Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Taddei Tondo&quot;===
The most prized possession of the Academy&#x27;s collection is Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Taddei Tondo&quot;, left to the Academy by Sir George Beaumont. The Tondo is usually on display in the Collection Gallery, which opened in May 2018. Carved in Florence in 1504–1506, it is the only marble by Michelangelo in the United Kingdom and represents the Virgin Mary and child with the infant St John the Baptist.

==War memorials==
In the entrance portico are two war memorials. One is in memory of the students of the Royal Academy Schools who fell in World War I and the second commemorates the 2,003 men of the Artists Rifles who gave their lives in that war with a further plaque to those who died in World War II.

==Membership==
Membership of the Royal Academy is composed of up to 80 practising artists, each elected by ballot of the General Assembly of the Royal Academy, and known individually as Royal Academicians (RA). The Royal Academy is governed by these Royal Academicians. The 1768 Instrument of Foundation allowed total membership of the Royal Academy to be 40 artists. Originally engravers were completely excluded from the academy, but at the beginning of 1769 the category of Associate-Engraver was created. Their number was limited to six, and unlike other associates, they could not be promoted to full academicians. In 1853 membership of the Academy was increased to 42, and opened to engravers. In 1922, 154 years after the founding of the Royal Academy, Annie Swynnerton became the first woman Associate of the Royal Academy.

<doc id="161779" wikidata="Q208048" url="?curid=161779" title="Band of Brothers (miniseries)">
<text>Band of Brothers is a 2001 American war drama miniseries based on historian Stephen E. Ambrose&#x27;s 1992 non-fiction book of the same name. It was created by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who also served as executive producers, and who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; Episodes first aired on HBO from September 9, to November 4, 2001. Critically acclaimed, the series won the Emmy and Golden Globe awards for best miniseries.

The series dramatizes the history of &quot;Easy&quot; Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. It begins during Easy Company&#x27;s paratrooper training and follows its participation in the Western Front of World War II. The events are based on Ambrose&#x27;s research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took some literary license, adapting history for dramatic effect and series structure. The characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Each episode begins with excerpts from interviews with some of the survivors, who are identified by name only at the end of the finale.

The title of the book and series comes from the St. Crispin’s Day speech in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry V&quot;, delivered by King Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book&#x27;s first page; this passage is recited by Carwood Lipton in the series finale.

==Plot==
Over the course of ten episodes, &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; depicts a dramatized account of Easy Company&#x27;s exploits during World War II.

Episodes include their training at Camp Toccoa, the American airborne landings in Normandy, Operation Market Garden, the Siege of Bastogne, the invasion of Germany, the liberation of the Kaufering concentration camp, the taking of the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; (Eagle&#x27;s Nest) in Berchtesgaden, the occupation of Germany, and finally the war&#x27;s end.

Richard Winters is the central character, shown working to accomplish the company&#x27;s missions and keep his men together and safe. While the series features a large ensemble cast, each episode generally focuses on a single character, following his action.

As the series is based on historical events, the fates of the characters reflect those of the persons on which they are based. Many either die or sustain serious wounds which lead to their being sent home. Other soldiers recover after treatment in field hospitals and rejoin their units on the front line. Their experiences, and the moral, mental, and physical hurdles they must overcome, are central to the story&#x27;s narrative.

It follows the story from their initial training starting in 1942 to the end of World War II. They parachuted behind enemy lines in the early hours of D-Day in support of the landings at Utah beach, participated in the liberation of Carentan and again parachuted into action during Operation Market Garden. They also liberated a concentration camp and were the first to enter Hitler&#x27;s mountain retreat in Berchtesgaden.

==Production==
The series was developed chiefly by Tom Hanks and Erik Jendresen, who spent months detailing the plot outline and individual episodes. Steven Spielberg served as &quot;the final eye&quot; and used &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, the film on which he and Hanks had collaborated, to inform the series, although Jendresen served as showrunner. Accounts of Easy Company veterans, such as Donald Malarkey, were incorporated into production to add historic detail.

===Budget and promotion===
&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; was at the time the most expensive TV miniseries to have been made by any network. Its budget was about $125 million, or an average of $12.5 million per episode.

An additional $15 million was allocated for a promotional campaign, which included screenings for World War II veterans. One was held at Utah Beach, Normandy, where U.S. troops had landed on June 6, 1944. On June 7, 2001, 47 Easy Company veterans were flown to Paris and then traveled by chartered train to the site, where the series premiered. Chrysler was a sponsor, as its Jeeps were used in the series. Chrysler spent $5 million to $15 million on its advertising campaign, using footage from &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. Each of the spots was reviewed and approved by the co-executive producers Hanks and Spielberg.

The BBC paid £7 million ($10.1 million) as co-production partner, the most it had ever paid for a bought-in program, and screened it on BBC Two. Originally, it was to have aired on BBC One but was moved to allow an &quot;uninterrupted ten-week run&quot;, with the BBC denying that this was because the series was not sufficiently mainstream. Negotiations were monitored by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who spoke personally to Spielberg.

===Location===
The series was shot over eight to ten months on Ellenbrook Fields, at Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire, England. This location had been used to shoot the film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. Various sets were built, including replicas on the large open field of 12 European towns, among them Bastogne, Belgium; Eindhoven, Netherlands; and Carentan, France. North Weald Airfield in Essex was used for shots depicting the take-offs for the D-Day Normandy landings.

The village of Hambleden, in Buckinghamshire, England, was used extensively in the early episodes to depict the company&#x27;s training in England, as well as in later scenes. The scenes set in Germany and Austria were shot in Switzerland, in and near the village of Brienz in the Bernese Oberland, and at the nearby Hotel Giessbach.

===Historical accuracy===
To preserve historical accuracy, the writers conducted additional research. One source was the memoir of Easy Company soldier David Kenyon Webster, &quot;Parachute Infantry: An American Paratrooper&#x27;s Memoir of D-Day and the Fall of the Third Reich&quot; (1994). This was published by LSU Press, following renewed interest in World War II and more than 30 years after his death in a boating accident. In &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; Ambrose quoted liberally from Webster&#x27;s unpublished diary entries, with permission from his estate.

The production team consulted Dale Dye, a retired United States Marine Corps captain and consultant on &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, as well as with most of the surviving Easy Company veterans, including Richard Winters, Bill Guarnere, Frank Perconte, Ed Heffron, and Amos Taylor. Dye (who portrays Colonel Robert Sink) instructed the actors in a 10-day boot camp at the Longmoor Military Camp in Hampshire, culminating with parachute training at RAF Brize Norton.

The production aimed for accuracy in the detail of weapons and costumes. Simon Atherton, the weapons master, corresponded with veterans to match weapons to scenes, and assistant costume designer Joe Hobbs used photos and veteran accounts.

Most actors had contact with the individuals they were to portray before filming, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site. Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: &quot;We&#x27;ve made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down a vast number of characters, fold other people&#x27;s experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But I still think it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this.&quot; As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.

Shortly after the premiere of the series, Tom Hanks asked Major Winters what he thought of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. The major responded, &quot;I wish that it would have been more authentic. I was hoping for an 80 percent solution.&quot; Hanks responded, &quot;Look, Major, this is Hollywood. At the end of the day we will be hailed as geniuses if we get this 12 percent right. We are going to shoot for 17 percent.&quot;
The liberation of one of the Kaufering subcamps of Dachau was depicted in episode 9 (&quot;Why We Fight&quot;); however, the 101st Airborne Division arrived at Kaufering Lager IV subcamp on the day after it was discovered by the 134th Ordnance Maintenance Battalion of the 12th Armored Division, on April 27, 1945. German historian and Holocaust researcher Anton Posset worked with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks as a consultant, providing photographs of the liberators and documentation of the survivors&#x27; reports he had collected over the years. The camp was reconstructed in England for the miniseries.

It is uncertain which Allied unit was first to reach the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot;. Several claim the honor, compounded by confusion with the town of Berchtesgaden, which was taken on May 4 by forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. Reputedly members of the 7th went as far as the elevator to the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot;, with at least one individual claiming he and a partner continued on to the top. However, the 101st Airborne maintains it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the Kehlsteinhaus. Elements of the French 2nd Armored Division, Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis and Paul Répiton-Préneuf, were present on the night of May 4 to 5, and took several photographs before leaving on May 10 at the request of US command, and this is supported by testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them.

Major Dick Winters, who commanded the 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 506th PIR in May 1945, stated that they entered Berchtesgaden shortly after noon on May 5. He challenged competing claims stating, &quot;If the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Division was first in Berchtesgaden, just where did they go? Berchtesgaden is a relatively small community. I walked into the Berchtesgaden Hof with Lieutenant Welsh and saw nobody other than some servants. Goering&#x27;s Officers&#x27; Club and wine cellar certainly would have caught the attention of a French soldier from LeClerc&#x27;s 2nd Armored Division, or a rifleman from the U.S. 3rd Division. I find it hard to imagine, if the 3rd Division was there first, why they left those beautiful Mercedes staff cars untouched for our men.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; has a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.1/10 and based on 34 reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; offers a visceral, intense look at the horrors of war – and the sacrifices of the millions of ordinary people who served.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, gives the miniseries a score of 87 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

CNN&#x27;s Paul Clinton said that the miniseries &quot;is a remarkable testament to that generation of citizen soldiers, who responded when called upon to save the world for democracy and then quietly returned to build the nation that we now all enjoy, and all too often take for granted&quot;. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an extraordinary 10-part series that masters its greatest challenge: it balances the ideal of heroism with the violence and terror of battle, reflecting what is both civilized and savage about war.&quot; James also remarked on the generation gap between most viewers and characters, suggesting this was a significant hurdle. Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that the series was &quot;significantly flawed and yet absolutely extraordinary—just like the men it portrays,&quot; rating the series four out of four stars. He noted however that it was hard to identify with individual characters during crowded battle scenes.

Philip French of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that he had &quot;seen nothing in the cinema this past year that impressed me as much as BBC2&#x27;s 10-part &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and Ken Loach&#x27;s &quot;The Navigators&quot; on Channel 4&quot;, and that it was &quot;one of the best films ever made about men in war and superior in most ways to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.&quot; Matt Seaton, also in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote that the film&#x27;s production was &quot;on such a scale that in an ad hoc, inadvertent way it gives one a powerful sense of what really was accomplished during the D-Day invasion - the extraordinary logistical effort of moving men and matériel in vast quantities.&quot;

Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that though the series is &quot;at times visually astonishing,&quot; it suffers from &quot;disorganization, muddled thinking and a sense of redundancy.&quot; Shales observed that the characters are hard to identify: &quot;Few of the characters stand out strikingly against the backdrop of the war. In fact, this show is all backdrop and no frontdrop. When you watch two hours and still aren&#x27;t quite sure who the main characters are, something is wrong.&quot;

&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; has become a benchmark for World War II series. The German series &quot;Generation War,&quot; for example, was characterized by critics as &quot;Band of Brüder&quot; (the German word for &quot;Brothers&quot;).

===Ratings===
&quot;Band of Brothers&quot;″ September 9, 2001 premiere drew almost 10 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the September 11 attacks occurred, and HBO immediately ceased its marketing campaign. The third episode drew 7.2 million viewers and the last episode received almost 5.1 million viewers, the smallest audience.

===Awards and nominations===
The series was nominated for 20 Primetime Emmy Awards and won seven, including Outstanding Miniseries and Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie, or Dramatic Special. It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television, American Film Institute Award for TV Movie or Miniseries of the Year, Producers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Producer of Long-Form Television, and the TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Movies, Miniseries, and Specials.

The show was selected for a Peabody Award for &quot;relying on both history and memory to create a new tribute to those who fought to preserve liberty.&quot; In September 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the show 68th on its list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century, stating that it &quot;expanded the horizons – and budgets – of prestige TV&quot;.

===&quot;He Has Seen War&quot;===
In 2011, HBO aired a documentary entitled &quot;He Has Seen War&quot; with Tom Hanks as executive producer and Mark Herzog as director about the postwar stories of and lasting effects of the war, including post-traumatic stress disorder, on not only Easy Company members but also members of the 1st Marine Division who were subjects of &quot;The Pacific&quot; after the division fought at Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Guarnere and Donald Malarkey both appear alongside their families, as does the family of Lynn &quot;Buck&quot; Compton and also the families of Corporal Eugene Sledge and Private Robert Leckie, two of the members of the 1st Marine Division who are central characters in &quot;The Pacific&quot;.

===&quot;Dick Winters: Hang Tough&quot;===
In 2012, the Richard D. Winters Leadership Monument near Sainte-Marie-du-Mont in Normandy recognizing all American junior officers, together with their divisions and corps, who led the way on D-Day, was unveiled on the 68th anniversary of the invasion. For the occasion, the World War II Foundation, which raised the funds for the monument, produced a biographical documentary entitled &quot;Dick Winters: Hang Tough&quot;. Damian Lewis, who played Winters, narrates the film in the American accent he used while playing him. Documentary filmmaker and World War II Foundation founder and president Tim Gray is the creator of the overall film, which includes actual photos, photos from the miniseries and interviews with the real-life Winters and other Easy Company members including a number who were portrayed in the show such as Guarnere, Malarkey, Edward &quot;Babe&quot; Heffron, Frank Perconte and Edward Tipper.

Special attention was paid to the Brécourt Manor Assault including the owners of Brécourt Manor to this day — the Vallavieille family, including Utah Beach Museum founder Michel de Vallavieille, who was wounded after being mistaken for a German soldier — and the creation of the bronze statue of Winters by sculptor Steven Spears.

===&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; Podcast===
In 2021, on the occasion of the miniseries&#x27; 20th anniversary, HBO produced an official podcast hosted by British-American author, broadcaster and filmmaker Roger Bennett of the Men in Blazers soccer show and podcast. After a prologue episode featuring Tom Hanks as executive producer, it progresses through each episode giving a brief summary before interviewing actors and crew members about their roles, their careers leading up to the miniseries, their experiences with the show and the specific episode.

<text>Covent Garden is a district in London, on the eastern fringes of the West End, between St Martin&#x27;s Lane and Drury Lane. It is associated with the former fruit-and-vegetable market in the central square, now a popular shopping and tourist site, and with the Royal Opera House, itself known as &quot;Covent Garden&quot;. The district is divided by the main thoroughfare of Long Acre, north of which is given over to independent shops centred on Neal&#x27;s Yard and Seven Dials, while the south contains the central square with its street performers and most of the historical buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the London Transport Museum and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

The area was fields until briefly settled in the 7th century when it became the heart of the Anglo-Saxon trading town of Lundenwic, then abandoned at the end of the 9th century after which it returned to fields. By 1200 part of it had been walled off by the Abbot of Westminster Abbey for use as arable land and orchards, later referred to as &quot;the garden of the Abbey and Convent&quot;, and later &quot;the Convent Garden&quot;. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was granted in 1552 by the young King Edward VI to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford (1485–1555), the trusted adviser to his father King Henry VIII. The 4th Earl commissioned Inigo Jones to build some fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Jones designed the Italianate arcaded square along with the church of St Paul&#x27;s. The design of the square was new to London and had a significant influence on modern town planning, acting as the prototype for new estates as London grew.

By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable market had developed on the south side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century it had become notorious for its abundance of brothels. An act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler&#x27;s neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the New Covent Garden Market about three miles (5 km) southwest at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.

Covent Garden falls within the London boroughs of Westminster and Camden and the parliamentary constituencies of Cities of London and Westminster and Holborn and St Pancras. The area has been served by the Piccadilly line at Covent Garden tube station since 1907; the journey from Leicester Square tube station is the shortest in London.

==History==

===Early history===
During the Roman period, what is now the Strand – running along the southern boundary of the area that was to become Covent Garden – was part of the route to Silchester, known as &quot;Iter VII&quot; on the Antonine Itinerary. Excavations in 2006 at St Martin-in-the-Fields revealed a group of late Roman graves, suggesting the site had been sacred since at least 350 AD. The area to the north of the Strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century, but theories by Alan Vince and Martin Biddle that there had been an Anglo-Saxon settlement to the west of the old Roman town of Londinium were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005. These revealed that a trading town, called Lundenwic, developed around 600 AD, stretching from Trafalgar Square to Aldwych, with Covent Garden at the centre. Alfred the Great gradually shifted the settlement into the old Roman town of Londinium from around 886 AD onwards, leaving no mark of the old town, and the site returned to fields.

The first mention of a walled garden comes from a document, , detailing land owned by the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of St Peter, Westminster. A later document, dated between 1250 and 1283, refers to &quot;the garden of the Abbot and Convent of Westminster&quot;. By the 13th century this had become a quadrangle of mixed orchard, meadow, pasture and arable land, lying between modern-day St Martin&#x27;s Lane and Drury Lane, and Floral Street and Maiden Lane. The use of the name &quot;Covent&quot;—an Anglo-French term for a religious community, equivalent to &quot;monastery&quot; or &quot;convent&quot;—appears in a document in 1515, when the Abbey, which had been letting out parcels of land along the north side of the Strand for inns and market gardens, granted a lease of the walled garden, referring to it as &quot;a garden called Covent Garden&quot;. This is how it was recorded from then on.

===Bedford Estate (1552–1918)===

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 under King Henry VIII, monastic lands in England reverted to the crown, including lands belonging to Westminster Abbey such as the Convent Garden and seven acres to the north called Long Acre. In 1552 King Edward VI granted it to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, his late father&#x27;s trusted adviser. The Russell family, who in 1694 were advanced in the peerage from Earl to Duke of Bedford, held the land until 1918.

Russell built Bedford House and garden on part of the land, with an entrance on the Strand, the large garden stretching back along the south side of the old walled-off convent garden. In 1630 Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford commissioned the architect Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around a large square or piazza. This had been prompted by King Charles I having taken offence at the poor condition of the road and houses along Long Acre, which were the responsibility of Russell and Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth. Russell and Carey complained that under the 1625 Proclamation concerning Buildings, which restricted building in and around London, they could not build new houses. For a fee of £2,000, the King then granted Russell a licence to build as many new houses on his land as he &quot;shall thinke fitt and convenient&quot;.

The houses initially attracted the wealthy, although they moved out when a market developed on the south side of the square around 1654, and coffee houses, taverns, and prostitutes moved in.

The Bedford Estate was expanded by the inheritance of the former manor of Bloomsbury to the immediate north of Covent Garden following the marriage of William Russell, Lord Russell (1639–1683) (third son of William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford of Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire) to Rachel Wriothesley, heiress of Bloomsbury, younger of the two daughters and co-heiresses of Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton (1607-1667). Rachel&#x27;s son and heir was Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford (1680–1711).

By the 18th century, Covent Garden had become a well-known red-light district, attracting notable prostitutes such as Betty Careless and Jane Douglas. Descriptions of the prostitutes and where to find them were provided by &quot;Harris&#x27;s List of Covent Garden Ladies&quot;, the &quot;essential guide and accessory for any serious gentleman of pleasure&quot;. In 1830 a market hall was built to provide a more permanent trading centre. In 1913 Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford agreed to sell the Covent Garden Estate for £2 million to the MP and land speculator Harry Mallaby-Deeley, who sold his option in 1918 to the Beecham family for £250,000.
===Modern changes===
The Covent Garden Estate was part of Beecham Estates and Pills Limited from 1924 to 1928, after which it was managed by a successor company called Covent Garden Properties, owned by the Beechams and other private investors. This new company sold some properties at Covent Garden, while becoming active in property investment in other parts of London. In 1962 the bulk of the remaining properties in the Covent Garden area, including the market, were sold to the newly established government-owned Covent Garden Authority for £3,925,000.

By the end of the 1960s, traffic congestion had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in Nine Elms, between Battersea and Vauxhall in southwest London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.

After consulting with residents and local businesses, Westminster Council drew up an action plan to improve the area while retaining its historic character in 2004. The market buildings, along with several other properties in Covent Garden, were bought by a Property company in 2006.

==Geography==
Historically, the Bedford Estate defined the boundary of Covent Garden, with Drury Lane to the east, the Strand to the south, St Martin&#x27;s Lane to the west, and Long Acre to the north. However, over time the area regarded as part of Covent Garden has expanded northwards past Long Acre to High Holborn. Since 1971, with the creation of the Covent Garden Conservation Area which incorporated part of the area between St Martin&#x27;s Lane and Charing Cross Road, Charing Cross Road has sometimes been taken as its western boundary. Long Acre is the main thoroughfare, running north-east from St Martin&#x27;s Lane to Drury Lane. Shelton Street, running parallel to the north of Long Acre, marks the London borough boundary between Camden and Westminster.

The area to the south of Long Acre contains the Royal Opera House, the market and central square, and most of the elegant buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the London Transport Museum; while the area to the north of Long Acre is largely given over to independent retail units centred on Neal Street, Neal&#x27;s Yard and Seven Dials; though this area also contains residential buildings such as Odhams Walk, built in 1981 on the site of the Odhams print works, and is home to 7,000 residents.

==Governance==
The Covent Garden estate was originally under the control of Westminster Abbey and lay in the parish of St Margaret. During a reorganisation in 1542 it was transferred to St Martin in the Fields, and then in 1645 a new parish was created, splitting governance of the estate between the parishes of St Paul Covent Garden and St Martin, both still within the Liberty of Westminster. St Paul Covent Garden was completely surrounded by the parish of St Martin in the Fields. It was grouped into the Strand District in 1855. In 1900 it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster and was abolished as a civil parish in 1922. The northern reaches of Covent Garden were within the ancient parish of St Giles in the Fields and outside the Liberty of Westminster. They were from 1855 to 1900 part of the St Giles District and from 1900 part of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn.

Covent Garden came within the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works from 1855 and in 1889 became part of the County of London. Since 1965 Covent Garden falls within the London boroughs of Westminster and Camden, and is in the Parliamentary constituencies of Cities of London and Westminster and Holborn and St Pancras. For local council elections it falls within the St James&#x27;s ward for Westminster, and the Holborn and Covent Garden ward for Camden.

==Economy==
Covent Garden Market reopened in 1980 as a shopping arcade with restaurants and a pub. The central hall has shops, cafes and bars alongside the Apple Market stalls selling antiques, jewellery, clothing and gifts; there are additional casual stalls in the Jubilee Hall Market on the south side of the square. In 2010, what was then the largest Apple Store in the world opened in The Piazza. Long Acre has clothes shops and boutiques, and Neal Street is noted for its numerous shoe shops. London Transport Museum and the side entrance to the Royal Opera House box office and other facilities are also located on the square. During the late 1970s and 1980s the &quot;Rock Garden&quot; music venue was popular with up-and-coming punk rock and new wave artists.

The market halls and several other buildings in Covent Garden were bought by Capital &amp; Counties Properties (now known as Shaftesbury Capital) in partnership with GE Real Estate in August 2006 for £421 million, on a 150-year head lease. The buildings are let to the Covent Garden Area Trust, who pay an annual peppercorn rent of one red apple and a posy of flowers for each head lease, and the Trust protects the property from being redeveloped. In March 2007 CapCo also acquired the shops located under the Royal Opera House. The complete Covent Garden Estate owned by CapCo consists of , and, as of 2007, has a market value of £650 million. 

==Landmarks==

===Royal Opera House===

The Royal Opera House, known as &quot;Covent Garden&quot;, was constructed as the &quot;Theatre Royal&quot; in 1732 to a design by Edward Shepherd. During the first hundred years or so of its history, the theatre was primarily a playhouse, with the Letters Patent granted by Charles II giving Covent Garden and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, exclusive rights to present spoken drama in London. In 1734, the first ballet was presented; a year later Handel&#x27;s first season of operas began. Many of his operas and oratorios were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premières here. It has been the home of The Royal Opera since 1945, and the Royal Ballet since 1946.

The current building is the third theatre on the site following destructive fires in 1808 and 1857. The façade, foyer and auditorium were designed by Edward Barry, and date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive £178 million reconstruction in the 1990s. The main auditorium is a Grade I listed building. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, previously a part of the old Covent Garden Market, created a large new public gathering place. In 1779 the pavement outside the playhouse was the scene of the murder of Martha Ray, mistress of the Earl of Sandwich, by her admirer the Rev. James Hackman.

===Covent Garden Piazza===
The central square in Covent Garden is simply called &quot;Covent Garden&quot;, often marketed as &quot;Covent Garden Piazza&quot; to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site&#x27;s owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones&#x27;s design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d&#x27;Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones&#x27;s overall design.

The church of St Paul&#x27;s was the first building and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the &quot;Great Piazza&quot; and that to the south of Russell Street as the &quot;Little Piazza&quot;. None of Inigo Jones&#x27;s houses remains, though part of the north group was reconstructed in 1877–79 as Bedford Chambers by William Cubitt to a design by Henry Clutton.

===Covent Garden market===

The first record of a &quot;new market in Covent Garden&quot; is in 1654 when market traders set up stalls against the garden wall of Bedford House. The Earl of Bedford acquired a private charter from Charles II in 1670 for a fruit and vegetable market, permitting him and his heirs to hold a market every day except Sundays and Christmas Day. The original market, consisting of wooden stalls and sheds, became disorganised and disorderly, and John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, requested an act of Parliament in 1813 to regulate it, then commissioned Charles Fowler in 1830 to design the neo-classical market building that is the heart of Covent Garden today. The &quot;greater part of the pillars&quot; were built from granite quarried from Cairngall in today&#x27;s Aberdeenshire. The contractor was William Cubitt and Company. Further buildings were added—the Floral hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market for foreign flowers was built by Cubitt and Howard.

By the end of the 1960s, traffic congestion was causing problems for the market, which required increasingly large lorries for deliveries and distribution. The redevelopment was considered, but protests from the Covent Garden Community Association in 1973 prompted the Home Secretary, Robert Carr, to give dozens of buildings around the square listed-building status, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market relocated to its new site, New Covent Garden Market, about three miles (5 km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980, with cafes, pubs, small shops and a craft market called the Apple Market. Among the first shops to relocate here was Benjamin Pollock&#x27;s Toy Shop. Another market, the Jubilee Market, is held in the Jubilee Hall on the south side of the square. The market halls and several other buildings in Covent Garden have been owned by the property company Capital &amp; Counties Properties (CapCo) since 2006. In 1980 the London Transport Museum opened in part of the old flower market buildings, and these were refurbished in around 2005 to re-open in 2007.

===Theatre Royal, Drury Lane===

The current Theatre Royal on Drury Lane is the most recent of four incarnations, the first of which opened in 1663, making it the oldest continuously used theatre in London. For much of its first two centuries, it was, along with the Royal Opera House, a patent theatre granted rights in London for the production of drama, and had a claim to be one of London&#x27;s leading theatres. The first theatre, known as &quot;Theatre Royal, Bridges Street&quot;, saw performances by Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart. After it was destroyed by fire in 1672, English dramatist and theatre manager Thomas Killigrew constructed a larger theatre on the same spot, which opened in 1674. Killigrew&#x27;s theatre lasted nearly 120 years, under leadership including Colley Cibber, David Garrick, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. In 1791, under Sheridan&#x27;s management, the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794. However, that survived only 15 years, burning down in 1809. The building that stands today opened in 1812. It has been home to actors as diverse as Shakespearean actor Edmund Kean, child actress Clara Fisher, comedian Dan Leno, the comedy troupe Monty Python (who recorded a concert album there), and musical composer and performer Ivor Novello. Since November 2008 the theatre has been owned by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and generally stages popular musical theatre. It is a Grade I listed building.

===London Transport Museum===

The London Transport Museum is in a Victorian iron and glass building on the east side of the market square. It was designed as a dedicated flower market by William Rogers of William Cubitt and Company in 1871, and was first occupied by the museum in 1980. Previously the transport collection had been held at Syon Park and Clapham. The first parts of the collection were brought together at the beginning of the 20th century by the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) when it began to preserve buses being retired from service. After the LGOC was taken over by the London Electric Railway (LER), the collection was expanded to include rail vehicles. It continued to expand after the LER became part of the London Passenger Transport Board in the 1930s and as the organisation passed through various successor bodies up to TfL, London&#x27;s transport authority since 2000. The Covent Garden building has on display many examples of buses, trams, trolleybuses and rail vehicles from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as artefacts and exhibits related to the operation and marketing of passenger services and the impact that the developing transport network has had on the city and its population.

===St Paul&#x27;s Church===

St Paul&#x27;s, commonly known as the Actors&#x27; Church, was built in 1633, at a cost of £4,000, though was not consecrated until 1638. In 1645 Covent Garden was made a separate parish and the church was dedicated to St Paul. How much of Jones&#x27;s original building is left is unclear, as the church was damaged by fire in 1795 during restoration work by Thomas Hardwick; the columns are thought to be original but the rest is mostly Georgian or Victorian reconstruction.

===Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court building===

The building, opposite the Royal Opera House, was opened in 1881 to house both a Magistrates&#x27; Court and a police station. As well as dealing with local petty criminals, a number of high-profile defendants appeared in the court, including Oscar Wilde, Dr Crippen and the Kray twins, and those facing extradition proceedings, such as Augusto Pinochet and James Earl Ray.

The police station closed in 1992, with its work moving to the more modern Charing Cross police station. The court building&#x27;s Grade II listed status meant it was not economic to update it to modern standards and the court closed in July 2006. Sold to developers, planning permission was obtained to convert the building into a hotel and museum. A 91-room hotel and a public restaurant, run by the New York based NoMad chain, opened in May 2021, as did a museum of local police history in the former police station.

===Freemasons&#x27; Hall===

Freemasons&#x27; Hall is the headquarters of the United Grand Lodge of England and the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England, as well as a meeting place for many Masonic Lodges in the London area. It is in Great Queen Street between Holborn and Covent Garden and has been a Masonic meeting place since 1775. Parts of the building are open to the public daily, and its preserved classic Art Deco style, together with its regular use as a film and television location, have made it a tourist destination.

== An Historically Diverse Community ==
London newspaper adverts printed in the 17th and 18th century confirm the presence of free and unfree men, women and children of African and Asian heritage living and working in the area. Like Sarah, a young enslaved woman of colour who ran away from a Mary Vernon, at Fishers Warehouse in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden in 1746.

RUN away from her Mistress on Saturday Morning last...Sarah, but is suppos’d to have been lately christen’d; she is about twenty Years of Age, short and thick, has one of her little Fingers bent inwards, and is mark’d on the Right Shoulder with the Letters IV, speaks pretty good English, and took away with her a white Linnen Gown, a blue and white Linnen Gown, and a brown Stuff Gown, of her own Apparel: Whoever will bring her to her Mistress, Mary Vernon, at Fisher’s Warehouse in Tavistock-Street, Covent-Garden, shall have Five Guineas Reward; or who yet will give Notice where she may be found, shall have  Guinea for their Trouble; and if she will voluntarily return to her Mistress, she shall be kindly receiv’d, and all her Faults forgiven; but whoever shall harbour or entertain her after the Publication thereof, will be prosecuted to the Rigour of the Law.

Mary Vernon is believed to be the daughter of James Vernon Senior (whose wife was also called Mary) who was clerk to the supreme court of Jamaica. Mary was, therefore, the sister of James Vernon Junior, and Admiral Edward Vernon who coined the term ‘grog’ and sailed a fleet to Jamaica in July 1739. Admiral Vernon would have been tended to by enslaved domestic servants like Sarah when in Jamaica, and it was relatively common for Royal Navy commanders to bring these individuals to Britain when they returned, often gifting unfree women and girls to their mothers, wives and daughters. The initials I and V branded on Sarah’s shoulders could indicate that she had belonged to a Vernon in Jamaica before coming to Britain. There were a number of plantation owners in Jamaica of the same name who were related to the Vernons of Westminster.

==Culture==
The Covent Garden area has long been associated with entertainment and shopping. Covent Garden has 13 theatres, and over 60 pubs and bars, with most south of Long Acre, around the main shopping area of the old market. The Seven Dials area in the north of Covent Garden was home to the punk rock club The Roxy in 1977, and the area remains focused on young people with its trendy mid-market retail outlets.

===Street performance===

Street entertainment at Covent Garden was noted in Samuel Pepys&#x27;s diary in May 1662, when he recorded the first mention of a Punch and Judy show in Britain. Impromptu performances of song and swimming were given by local celebrity William Cussans in the eighteenth century. Covent Garden is licensed for street entertainment, and performers audition for timetabled slots in a number of venues around the market, including the North Hall, West Piazza, and South Hall Courtyard. The courtyard space is dedicated to classical music only.

There are street performances at Covent Garden Market every day of the year, except Christmas Day. Shows run throughout the day and are about 30 minutes in length. In March 2008, the market owner, CapCo, proposed to reduce street performances to one 30-minute show each hour.

===Pubs and bars===
The Covent Garden area has over 60 pubs and bars; several of them are listed buildings, with some also on CAMRA&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors; some, such as The Harp in Chandos Place, have received consumer awards. The Harp&#x27;s awards include London Pub of the Year in 2008 by the Society for the Preservation of Beers from the Wood, and National Pub of the Year by CAMRA in 2010. It was at one time owned by the Charrington Brewery, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated to just The Harp, before Charrington sold it to Punch Taverns in 1997. It was eventually purchased by the landlady Binnie Walsh around 2010 then subsequently sold by her to Fuller&#x27;s Brewery in 2014. It continues to win regular CAMRA pub awards under its new owners.

The Lamb and Flag in Rose Street is possibly the oldest pub in the area. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772 (when it was called the Cooper&#x27;s Arms – the name changing to Lamb &amp; Flag in 1833); the 1958 brick exterior conceals what may be an early 18th-century frame of a house replacing the original one built in 1638. The pub acquired a reputation for staging bare-knuckle prize fights during the early 19th century when it earned the nickname &quot;Bucket of Blood&quot;. The alleyway beside the pub was the scene of an attack on John Dryden in 1679 by thugs hired by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.

The Salisbury in St Martin&#x27;s Lane was built as part of a six-storey block around 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names, including the Coach &amp; Horses and Ben Caunt&#x27;s Head; it is both Grade II listed, and on CAMRA&#x27;s National Inventory, due to the quality of the etched and polished glass and the carved woodwork, summed up as &quot;good fin de siècle ensemble&quot;. The Freemasons Arms on Long Acre is linked with the founding of the Football Association in 1863; however, the meetings took place at The Freemason&#x27;s Tavern on Great Queen Street, which was replaced in 1909 by the Connaught Rooms.

Other Grade II listed pubs include three 19th century rebuilds of 17th century/18th century houses, the Nell Gwynne Tavern in Bull Inn Court, the Nag&#x27;s Head on James Street, and the White Swan on New Row; a Victorian pub built by lessees of the Marquis of Exeter, the Old Bell on the corner of Exeter Street and Wellington Street; and a late 18th or early 19th century pub the Angel and Crown on St Martin&#x27;s Lane.

===Restaurants===
There is a wide range of restaurants, mainly in Covent Garden&#x27;s central area around the piazza, and in the St Martin&#x27;s Lane area bordering the West End; some of these with international reputations. Among the restaurants are the historic theatrical eating places, the oldest of which is Rules, which was founded in 1798, making it the oldest restaurant in London, followed by J. Sheekey, an oyster bar and fish restaurant founded in 1893 by market-stall holder Josef Sheekey in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s St Martin&#x27;s Court, and The Ivy, which was founded as an unlicensed Italian cafe by Abel Giandellini in 1917. Other restaurants include Gaby&#x27;s Deli, a Jewish cafe and restaurant serving falafels and salt beef sandwiches since 1965, and Mon Plaisir, founded in 1943, one of the oldest French restaurants in London. Covent Garden was home to some of London&#x27;s earliest coffee shops, such as Old Slaughter&#x27;s Coffee House, which ran from 1692 until 1843, and a Beefsteak Club, the Sublime Society of Beef Steaks, which was co-founded in 1736 by William Hogarth at the Theatre Royal (now the Royal Opera House).

===Cultural connections===
Covent Garden, and especially the market, have appeared in a number of works. It is the place where Job Trotter, character of the Pickwick Papers by Dickens, spends the nights. In 1867, Johann Strauss II from Austria composed &quot;Erinnerung an Covent Garden&quot; (Memory of Covent Garden, op. 329). Eliza Doolittle, the central character in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play, &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, and the musical adaptation by Alan Jay Lerner, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, is a Covent Garden flower seller. Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Frenzy&quot; about a Covent Garden fruit vendor who becomes a serial sex killer, was set in the market where his father had been a wholesale greengrocer. The daily activity of the market was the topic of a 1957 Free Cinema documentary by Lindsay Anderson, &quot;Every Day Except Christmas&quot;, which won the Grand Prix at the Venice Festival of Shorts and Documentaries.

===Covent Garden Festival===

The Covent Garden Festival, also known as the BOC Covent Garden Festival due to sponsorship by BOC, is or was a festival of music and musical theatre staged across various venues in early summer each year. It was run by administrator Kenneth Richardson from 1996 to 2001. Its impending closure was announced in late 2001, owing to lack of sponsorship for 2002. However, official company records show incorporation in 1989 and ongoing registration .

Venues used for the festival have included the Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court; the Covent Garden piazza; the Royal Opera House; Cochrane Theatre, Holborn; Peacock Theatre in Kingsway WC2, venues at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and The Temple; and the Royal Courts of Justice on The Strand.

Performances at the festival include:
*Handel&#x27;s &quot;Flavio&quot; (1994), by the (Irish) Opera Theatre Company
*Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;After the Ball&quot; (1999), at the Peacock Theatre, directed by Paul Curran

===Cinemas===

The Garden Cinema, which opened in March 2022, is located in Parker Street. The cinema is designed in Art Deco style, inside and out. It was founded by retired legal publisher Michael Chambers, of Orbach and Chambers, who bought the office building in 2010 and, after selling his business in 2018, had it converted by architects Burrell Foley Fischer. It was ready by 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed its opening. The cinema partners with a number of film festivals and other organisations, as well as hosting Q&amp;As, live music, and poetry recitals.

==Transport==
Covent Garden tube station is situated on the corner of Long Acre and James Street. It is served by Piccadilly line trains, which link the area directly to important Central London destinations including King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, South Kensington, and Heathrow Airport (). The station opened in 1907, and is one of the few in Central London for which platform access is only by lift or stairs.

The journey from Covent Garden to Leicester Square is London&#x27;s shortest tube journey, at less than 300 yards. Leicester Square tube station is on the Piccadilly and Northern lines. The Northern line links Covent Garden directly to destinations such as Waterloo, Euston, and Camden Town.

Other nearby tube stations include Charing Cross, Embankment, and Holborn. Charing Cross is the nearest National Rail (&#x27;mainline&#x27;) station to Covent Garden.

More than 30 London Buses routes run along Covent Garden&#x27;s perimeters, although no routes run directly through Covent Garden following the permanent withdrawal of the RV1 route in 2019.

The Quietway 1 cycle route passes through Covent Garden. The route is signposted and runs on quieter roads or contraflow cycle lanes. The route runs northbound towards the Bloomsbury, and southbound to the Strand and Waterloo Bridge, via Bow Street.

The Santander Cycles bike sharing scheme operates in Covent Garden, with several docking points throughout the area.

<text>Elsa Sullivan Lanchester (28 October 1902 – 26 December 1986) was a British actress with a long career in theatre, film and television.

Lanchester studied dance as a child and after the First World War began performing in theatre and cabaret, where she established her career over the following decade. She met the actor Charles Laughton in 1927, and they were married two years later. She began playing small roles in British films, including the role of Anne of Cleves with Laughton in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933). Her success in American films resulted in the couple moving to Hollywood, where Lanchester played small film roles.

Her role as the title character in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935) brought her recognition. She played the lead in &quot;Passport to Destiny&quot; (1944) and supporting roles through the 1940s and 1950s. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Come to the Stable&quot; (1949) and &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957), the last of twelve films in which she appeared with Laughton. Following Laughton&#x27;s death in 1962, Lanchester resumed her career with appearances in such Disney films as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), &quot;Pajama Party&quot; (1964), &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; (1965) and &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1968). The horror film &quot;Willard&quot; (1971) was highly successful, and one of her last roles was in &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976).

==Early life==
Elsa Sullivan Lanchester was born in Lewisham, London. Her parents, James &quot;Séamus&quot; Sullivan (1872–1945) and Edith &quot;Biddy&quot; Lanchester (1871–1966), were Bohemians, and refused to marry in a religious or legal way as a rebellion against Edwardian era society. Sullivan and Lanchester were both socialists, according to Lanchester&#x27;s 1970 interview with Dick Cavett. Elsa&#x27;s older brother, Waldo Sullivan Lanchester, born five years earlier, was a puppeteer, with his own marionette company based in Malvern, Worcestershire, and later in Stratford-upon-Avon. Elsa studied dance in Paris under Isadora Duncan, whom she disliked. When the school was discontinued due to outbreak of World War I, she returned to the UK. At that point (she was about twelve years of age) she began teaching dance in the Duncan style and gave classes to children in her south London district, through which she earned some welcome extra income for her household.

==Career==
After World War I, Lanchester started the Children&#x27;s Theatre, and later the Cave of Harmony, a nightclub at which modern plays and cabaret turns were performed. She revived old Victorian songs and ballads, many of which she retained for her performances in another revue entitled &quot;Riverside Nights&quot;. Her first film performance came in 1924 in the amateur production &quot;The Scarlet Woman&quot;, which was written by Evelyn Waugh who also appeared in two roles himself.

She became sufficiently famous for Columbia to invite her into the recording studio to make 78 rpm discs of four of the numbers she sang in these revues, with piano arrangement and accompaniment by Kay Henderson: &quot;Please Sell No More Drink to My Father&quot; and &quot;He Didn&#x27;t Oughter&quot; were on one disc (recorded in 1926) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell My Mother I&#x27;m Living in Sin&quot; and &quot;The Ladies Bar&quot; were on the other (recorded 1930). Her cabaret and nightclub appearances led to more serious stage work and it was in a play by Arnold Bennett called &quot;Mr Prohack&quot; (1927) that Lanchester first met another member of the cast, Charles Laughton. They were married two years later and continued to act together from time to time, both on stage and screen. She played his daughter in the stage play &quot;Payment Deferred&quot; (1931) though not in the subsequent Hollywood film version. Lanchester and Laughton appeared in the Old Vic season of 1933–34, playing Shakespeare, Chekhov and Wilde, and in 1936 she was Peter Pan to Laughton&#x27;s Captain Hook in J. M. Barrie&#x27;s play at the London Palladium. Their last stage appearance together was in Jane Arden&#x27;s &quot;The Party&quot; (1958) at the New Theatre, London.
Lanchester made her film debut in &quot;The Scarlet Woman&quot; (1925) and in 1928 appeared in three silent shorts written for her by H. G. Wells and directed by Ivor Montagu: &quot;Blue Bottles&quot;, &quot;Daydreams&quot; and &quot;The Tonic&quot;. Laughton made brief appearances in all of them. They also appeared together in a 1930 film revue entitled &quot;Comets&quot;, featuring British stage, musical and variety acts, in which they sang in duet &quot;The Ballad of Frankie and Johnnie&quot;. Lanchester appeared in several other early British talkies, including &quot;Potiphar&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1931), a film starring Laurence Olivier. She appeared opposite Laughton again as Anne of Cleves in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933), with Laughton in the title role. Laughton was by now making films in Hollywood, so Lanchester joined him there, making minor appearances in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1935) and &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1935). These and her appearances in British films helped her gain the title role in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), arguably the role with which she remains most identified. She and Laughton returned to Britain to appear together again in &quot;Rembrandt&quot; (1936) and later in &quot;Vessel of Wrath&quot; (US: &quot;The Beachcomber&quot;. 1938). They both returned to Hollywood, where he made &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939) although Lanchester didn&#x27;t appear in another film until &quot;Ladies in Retirement&quot; (1941). She and Laughton played husband and wife (their characters were named Charles and Elsa Smith) in &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; (1942) and they both appeared again in the all-star, mostly British cast of &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943). She received top billing in &quot;Passport to Destiny&quot; (1944) for the only time in her Hollywood career.

Lanchester played supporting roles in &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; and &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (both 1946). She appeared as the housekeeper in &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1947) with David Niven playing the bishop, Loretta Young his wife, and Cary Grant an angel. Lanchester played a comical role as an artist in the thriller, &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1948), in which Laughton starred as a press tycoon. She had a part as a painter specialising in nativity scenes in &quot;Come to the Stable&quot; (1949), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (1949). During the late 1940s and 1950s she appeared in small but highly varied supporting roles in a number of films while simultaneously appearing on stage at the &quot;Turnabout Theatre&quot; in Hollywood. Here she performed her solo vaudeville act in conjunction with a marionette show, singing somewhat off-colour songs which she later recorded for a couple of LPs. Onscreen, she appeared alongside Danny Kaye in &quot;The Inspector General&quot; (1949), played a blackmailing landlady in &quot;Mystery Street&quot; (1950), and was Shelley Winters&#x27;s travelling companion in &quot;Frenchie&quot; (1950). More supporting roles followed in the early 1950s, including a 2-minute cameo as the Bearded Lady in &quot;3 Ring Circus&quot; (1954), about to be shaved by Jerry Lewis. She had another substantial and memorable part when she appeared again with her husband in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957) a screen version of Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1953 play for which both received Academy Award nominations – she for the second time as Best Supporting Actress, and Laughton for the third time for Best Actor. Neither won. However she did win the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for the film.

Lanchester played the role of Aunt Queenie, a witch in &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1958), and appeared in such films as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), in which her husband&#x27;s goddaughter Karen Dotrice also starred, &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; (1965), and &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1968). She appeared on 9 April 1959, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. She performed in two episodes of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;. Additionally, she had memorable guest roles in an episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in 1956 and in episodes of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1965). Lanchester continued to make occasional film appearances, singing a duet with Elvis Presley in &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot; (1967), and playing the mother in the original version of &quot;Willard&quot; (1971), alongside Bruce Davison and Ernest Borgnine, which scored well at the box office. She was Jessica Marbles, a sleuth based on Agatha Christie&#x27;s Jane Marple, in the 1976 murder mystery spoof &quot;Murder by Death&quot;, and she made her last film in 1980 as Sophie in &quot;Die Laughing&quot;. She released three LP albums in the 1950s. Two (referred to above) were entitled &quot;Songs for a Shuttered Parlour&quot; and &quot;Songs for a Smoke-Filled Room&quot;, and were vaguely lewd and danced around their true purpose, such as the song about her husband&#x27;s &quot;clock&quot; not working. Laughton provided the spoken introductions to each number and even joined Lanchester in the singing of &quot;She Was Poor but She Was Honest&quot;. Her third LP was entitled &quot;Cockney London&quot;, a selection of old London songs for which Laughton wrote the sleeve-notes.

==Personal life==
Lanchester married Charles Laughton in 1929. In 1938 she published a book about her relationship with Laughton, &quot;Charles Laughton and I&quot;. In March 1983, she released an autobiography, titled &quot;Elsa Lanchester Herself&quot;. In that book, she writes that she and Laughton never had children because he was homosexual. However, Laughton&#x27;s friend and co-star Maureen O&#x27;Hara denied this was the reason for the couple&#x27;s childlessness. She claimed Laughton had told her that the reason he and his wife never had children was because of a botched abortion Lanchester had early in her career when performing burlesque. Lanchester admitted in her autobiography that she had two abortions in her youth (one being Laughton&#x27;s), but it is not clear if the second left her incapable of becoming pregnant again. According to biographer Charles Higham, the reason she did not have children was that she did not want any.

Lanchester was an atheist. She was a Democrat and she and Laughton were supportive of Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election. In 1984, Lanchester&#x27;s health took a turn for the worse. Within 30 months, she had suffered two strokes, becoming totally incapacitated. She required constant care and was confined to bedrest. In March 1986, the Motion Picture and Television Fund filed to become conservator of Lanchester and her estate, which was valued at $900,000.

==Death==
Lanchester died in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, on 26 December 1986, aged 84, at the Motion Picture Hospital from bronchial pneumonia. Her body was cremated on 5 January 1987, at the Chapel of the Pines in Los Angeles and her ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean.

<text>The Technion – Israel Institute of Technology is a public research university located in Haifa, Israel. Established in 1912 by Jews under the dominion of the Ottoman Empire, the Technion is the oldest university in the country.

The university offers degrees in science and engineering, and related fields such as architecture, medicine, industrial management, and education. It has 19 academic departments, 60 research centers, and 12 affiliated teaching hospitals. Since its founding, it has awarded more than 123,000 degrees and its graduates are cited for providing the skills and education behind the creation and protection of the State of Israel.

Technion&#x27;s 565 faculty members include three Nobel Laureates in chemistry. Four Nobel Laureates have been associated with the university. The current president of the Technion is Uri Sivan.

The selection of Hebrew as the language of instruction, defeating German in the War of the Languages, was an important milestone in Hebrew&#x27;s consolidation as Israel&#x27;s official language. The Technion is also a major factor behind the growth of Israel&#x27;s high-tech industry and innovation, including the country&#x27;s technical cluster in Silicon Wadi.

==History==
The Technikum was conceived in the early 1900s by the German-Jewish fund Ezrah as a school of engineering and sciences. It was to be the only institution of higher learning in the then Ottoman Palestine, other than the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem (founded in 1906). In October 1913, the board of trustees selected German as the language of instruction, provoking a major controversy known as the War of the Languages. After opposition from American and Russian Jews to the use of German, the board of trustees reversed itself in February 1914 and selected Hebrew as the language of instruction. The German name Technikum was also replaced by the Hebrew name Technion.

Technion&#x27;s cornerstone was laid in 1912, and studies began 12 years later in 1924. In 1923 Albert Einstein visited and planted the now-famous first palm tree, as an initiative of Nobel tradition. The first palm tree still stands today in front of the old Technion building, which is now the MadaTech museum, in the Hadar neighborhood. Einstein founded the first Technion Society, and served as its president upon his return to Germany.

In 1924, Arthur Blok became the Technion&#x27;s first president.

In the early 1950s, under the administration of Yaakov Dori, who had served as the Israel Defense Forces’ first chief of staff, the Technion launched a campaign to recruit Jewish and pro-Israel scientists from abroad to establish research laboratories and teaching departments in the natural and exact sciences.

==Campuses==

===Haifa===
Technion City generally refers to the 1.2-square-kilometer site located on the pine-covered north-eastern slopes of Mount Carmel. The campus comprises over 300 buildings. 

The Technion has two additional campuses. Its original building in midtown Haifa, in use by the Technion until the mid-1980s, now houses the Israel National Museum of Science, Technology and Space. The Rappaport Faculty of Medicine is located in the neighborhood of Bat Galim, adjacent to Rambam Hospital, the largest medical center in Northern Israel.

Recreational activities on the main campus include an Olympic-size swimming pool as well as gymnastics, squash, and tennis facilities. The Technion Symphony Orchestra and Choir are composed mainly of Technion students and staff. Each term, the Orchestra offers a series of daytime and evening concerts. Films and live performances by leading Israeli artists take place on campus on a regular basis.

In April 2022, a cable car station of the Rakvalit was opened at the main campus, connecting the Technion to Haifa University (higher up on Mount Carmel) and to the HaMifratz Central Bus Station and public transit hub at the foot of Mount Carmel.

===Tel Aviv===
Technion&#x27;s Division of Continuing Education and External Studies has been operating in the Tel Aviv area since 1958. In July 2013, the Technion moved to a new campus in Sarona. The Technion satellite campus in Sarona includes three buildings in a 1,800 sq. meter area, with a total of 16 modern classrooms. Among the programs that are taught at Sarona are the Technion&#x27;s International MBA program, which includes students from around the world and guest lecturers from universities such as London Business School, Columbia University, and INSEAD.

===Cornell Tech===

On 19 December 2011, a bid by a consortium of Cornell University and Technion won a competition to establish a new high-tier applied science and engineering institution in New York City. The competition was established by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in order to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city&#x27;s technology sector. The winning bid consisted of a state-of-the-art tech campus, built on Roosevelt Island, which had its first phase completed by 2017, with a temporary off-site campus opening in 2013 at the Google New York City headquarters building at 111 Eighth Avenue. The new school has been named the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute. Its Founding Director was Craig Gotsman, Technion&#x27;s Hewlett-Packard Professor of Computer Engineering.

In 2015, AOL announced an investment of $5 million in a video research project at the institute. Positive media coverage abounds, as well as some small scale protests from the margins of political and environmental activism.

===Guangdong Technion Israel Institute of Technology===
In September 2013 the Li Ka Shing Foundation and the Technion announced they would be joining forces to create a new institute for technology at Shantou University, Guangdong province, south-eastern China. The Li Ka Shing Foundation pledged a grant of US$130 million for the creation of the institute. The degrees taught, including Bachelors, Masters and Doctorates, will be accredited by the Technion. The total construction costs are $147 million. English will be GTIIT&#x27;s language of instruction. GTIIT will comprise three units: the College of Engineering; the College of Science; and the College of Life Science. The goal is to have about 5,000 students eventually. The institute will eventually grant Technion engineering degrees at all levels - Bachelor, Masters and PhD. Initially the courses offered are Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology and Food Engineering, Materials Engineering. By 2020 the institute will start teaching other disciplines from Mechanics to Aerospace Engineering.

==Faculties==
===Aerospace Engineering===
Founded in 1954, the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering conducts research and education in a wide range of aerospace disciplines. The Aerospace Research Center also consists of the Aerodynamics (wind tunnels) Laboratory, the Aerospace Structures Laboratory, the Combustion and Rocket Propulsion Laboratory, the Turbo and Jet Engine Laboratory, the Flight Control Laboratory and the Design for Manufacturing Laboratory.

<text>Vorarlberg ( ; ; , , or ) is the westernmost state () of Austria. It has the second-smallest geographical area after Vienna and, although it also has the second-smallest population, it is the state with the second-highest population density (also after Vienna). It borders three countries: Germany (Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg via Lake Constance), Switzerland (Grisons and St. Gallen), and Liechtenstein. The only Austrian state that shares a border with Vorarlberg is Tyrol, to the east.

The capital of Vorarlberg is Bregenz (29,698 inhabitants), although Dornbirn (49,845 inhabitants) and Feldkirch (34,192 inhabitants) have larger populations. Vorarlberg is also the only state in Austria where the local dialect is not Austro-Bavarian, but rather an Alemannic dialect; it therefore has much more in common culturally with (historically) Alemannic-speaking German-speaking Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Baden-Württemberg, Bavarian Swabia, and Alsace than with the rest of Austria, southeastern Bavaria, and South Tyrol.

Vorarlberg is to a large extent mountainous, and two-thirds of the state is situated above 1,000m elevation. About 37% () of its surface is forest.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Vorarlberg&quot; literally means &#x27;before the Arl mountain&#x27;. The name &quot;Arl&quot; or &quot;Arlberg&quot; can be traced back to 1218 in various spellings &quot;(Arle, Arlen, Mons Arula, Arlenperge)&quot; and is derived from the numerous Arlen bushes there, the so-called mountain pines.

Its nickname is &quot;Ländle&quot; (&#x27;small land&#x27;). The frame of reference for this was the much larger and more populous County of Tyrol, from which the small district west of the Arlberg tried to detach itself. In 1861, Vorarlberg was finally raised to a crown land with its own state parliament. On the way to the detachment from Tyrol, the identification with the &#x27;Ländle&#x27; remained of great importance.

== Geography ==

The main rivers in Vorarlberg are the Ill (running through the Montafon and Walgau valleys into the Rhine), the Rhine (forming the border with Switzerland), the Bregenzer Ache and the Dornbirner Ach. One of the shortest rivers is the Galina. Important lakes, apart from Lake Constance are Lüner Lake, Silvretta Reservoir, Vermunt Lake, Spuller Lake, the Kops Basin and Formarin Lake; the first four were created for the production of hydroelectric energy. However, even before the dam for the power plant was built, Lüner Lake was the largest mountain lake in the Alps. Most of this hydroelectric energy is exported to Germany at peak times. At night, energy from power plants in Germany is used to pump water back into some of the lakes.

There are several notable mountain ranges in Vorarlberg, such as the Silvretta, the Rätikon, the Verwall and the Arlberg with many well-known skiing regions and ski resorts.

The tallest mountain is Piz Buin, whose rocky peak of is surrounded by glaciers. The distance from Lake Constance and the plains of the Alpine Rhine valley across the medium altitude and high Alpine zones to the glaciers of the Silvretta range is a mere .

Lake Constance is bordered by Germany, Switzerland and Austria and is Austria&#x27;s and Germany&#x27;s largest lake. It is also the venue for the annual Bregenzer Festspiele.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Vorarlberg is divided into four large districts, from north to south: Bregenz, Dornbirn, Feldkirch and Bludenz. These districts appear on the automobile license plates in form of abbreviations: B, DO, FK and BZ.

=== Biosphere reserve Großes Walsertal ===
The Biosphere Reserve Großes Walsertal covers about 19,200 ha and hosts 3,420 inhabitants and around 180 farms (42% of which are organic as of 2022). The reserve strives for a sustainable economy and tourism in the region and provides a platform for discussion about society, politics and science. The Biosphere Reserve Großes Walsertal has been a UNESCO biosphere reserve since 2000. Biosphere reserves are the ecological counterpart of the cultural world heritage sites. The biosphere reserve&#x27;s aim is sustainable development, education and research as well as the protection of natural diversity.

The Nagelfluhkette Nature Park is a cross-border nature park between the German Allgäu and the Austrian Bregenzerwald. The nature park is 24,700 hectares in size. It comprises a high level of biodiversity which is the result of Alpine transhumance (the cultivation of the land by humans) and the geological diversity. The Nagelfluhkette Nature Park offers guided hiking tours.

==History==
Before the Romans conquered Vorarlberg, there were two Celtic tribes settled in this area: the Raeti in the highlands, and the Vindelici in the lowlands, i.e. the Lake Constance region and the Rhine Valley. One of the important settlements of the Vindelici was Brigantion (modern Bregenz), founded around 500 BC. The first settlements in and around Bregenz date from 1500 BC. A Celtic tribe named &quot;Brigantii&quot; is mentioned by Strabo as a sub-tribe in these region of the Alps. The area of Vorarlberg was conquered by the Romans in 15 BC and it became part of the Roman province of Raetia. It was later conquered by Allemanic tribes in c. 450 AD.

It then fell under the rule of the Bavarians and was subsequently settled by the Bavarians and the Lombards. It later fell under the rule of the Counts of Bregenz until 1160 and then to the Counts of Montfort until 1525, when the Habsburgs took control.

The historically-Germanic province, which was a gathering-together of former bishoprics, was still ruled in part by a few semi-autonomous counts and surviving prince-bishops until the start of World War I. Vorarlberg was a part of Further Austria, and parts of the area were ruled by the Counts Montfort of Vorarlberg.

 Following World War I there was a desire by many in Vorarlberg to join Switzerland. In the Vorarlberg annexation referendum held on 11 May 1919, 80.75% of those voting supported a proposal for the state to join the Swiss Confederation. However, the proposed union never took place. Within Switzerland, the Swiss French and Swiss Italians were reluctant to take in another German-speaking area, and Opposition came from outside Switzerland as well; for example, Italy wanted Switzerland to give up Ticino if there were any changes on Switzerland&#x27;s eastern frontier. Vienna and the Allies also objected, out of concern for the balance of power in central Europe. The government of Vorarlberg opposed union with Switzerland, but began half-hearted negotiations with Bern after the overwhelming result of the referendum. When it became apparent that the Swiss were lukewarm at best to absorbing Vorarlberg as well, Vorarlberg remained with Austria. If Vorarlberg had joined Switzerland, then Liechtenstein would have been enclaved by Switzerland, like the situation of Lesotho, San Marino and Vatican City.

Following the Second World War Vorarlberg found itself occupied by French troops from 1945 to 1955, along with most of the state of Tyrol.

==Demographics==
The population of Vorarlberg is 397,094 (as of 1 January 2020). The majority (86%) of residents are of Austrian-Germanic stock with a cultural connection with Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west and Germany to the north. A sizable proportion of the population&#x27;s ancestors came from the Swiss canton of Valais in migrations of &quot;Walsers&quot;, including the Swiss French in the 19th century by invitation during the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. There has been a sizable minority of Turkish descent since the 1960s.

With around 150 inhabitants per square kilometer, Vorarlberg is the second most densely populated province in Austria after Vienna. With the conurbation between Feldkirch and Hörbranz, it has one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. Due to the early industrialization in comparison to other Austrian states, Vorarlberg developed into a classic immigration state as early as the 19th century. The state, which is small in terms of area, has the highest proportion of immigrants next to Vienna. In 2015, this was around 16% of the total population. Residents of German origin make up the largest migrant group, closely followed by immigrants from Turkey. People from countries of the former Yugoslavia are by far the third-largest immigrant group in Vorarlberg.

According to 2021 figures of Statistics Austria, 60.7% of the population are Catholic, and 7.6% are followers of other Christian denominations (3.8% Orthodox Christians, 2.5% Protestants, 1.3% other Christians). The second-largest religion, with a share of 13% is Islam. 0.6% of Vorarlberg&#x27;s inhabitants profess another religion, while 18.9% profess no affiliation with any religion or denomination.

=== Population development ===
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==Economy and infrastructure==

=== Location ===

For several years, the Vorarlberg economy has been performing well above the Austrian average. At roughly 66%, its export ratio is the highest among all of Austria&#x27;s states. While the overall Austrian GDP in 2004 rose by 2.0% in real terms, Vorarlberg recorded an increase of 2.9%. This came as a surprise, particularly as the major trading partners in Germany and Italy did not fare well. Owing to this robust economic performance, Vorarlberg was able to boost its gross regional product in 2014 to 15.2 billion euros according to the Economic Policy Department of the Vorarlberg Chamber of Trade. This translates into a nominal increase of 3.4% (cf Austria as a whole +5.2%). The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 19.1 billion € in 2018, accounting for 4.9% of the Austria&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €43,000 or 143% of the EU27 average in the same year. Vorarlberg is the state with the third highest GDP per capita in Austria. Vorarlberg and especially the Rhine Valley is one of the wealthiest areas in the world, with a very high standard of living. 
By far the biggest company in Vorarlberg is Alpla (plastic packaging), followed by Blum, Grass, Gebrüder Weiss (transport and logistics), Zumtobel Group (lighting systems), Doppelmayr (cablecars), Rauch (beverages) and Wolford (textiles).

Currently, five breweries are located in Vorarlberg: Mohrenbrauerei August Huber (in Dornbirn, since 1834), Brauerei Fohrenburg (in Bludenz, since 1881), Brauerei Egg (in Egg, since 1894), Vorarlberger Brauereigenosschenschaft – Brauerei Frastanz (in Frastanz, since 1902), Grabhers Sudwerk (in Bregenz, since 2016).

Overall, the economic expansion of Vorarlberg is &quot;very positive and for the future rated more dynamic than for the other states&quot;. Vorarlberg plans to be self-sufficient in energy by 2050.

=== Agriculture ===
In addition to the flourishing textile, clothing, electronics, machinery and packing materials industries of the Alpine Rhine Valley, there is also a broad agricultural base, especially in the Bregenzerwald (Bregenzerwald), which is known for its dairy products and tourism.

==== Alpine transhumance and cheese production ====

The three-level movement farming (&quot;Dreistufenwirtschaft&quot;) is essential to the economy of the mountainous regions in Vorarlberg. It is also known as Alpine transhumance and describes a seasonal droving of grazing livestock between the valleys in winter and the high mountain pastures in summer.

Alpine transhumance has a strong impact on the production of cheese in the Alps. It ensures that the cattle produces high-quality aromatic milk, the so-called &quot;Heumilch&quot; (&quot;hay milk&quot;), based on its special diet of natural meadow grass in comparison to silage. The use of hay milk in cheese production contributes to the distinctive flavour that determines more than 30 Alpine cheeses, including Vorarlberger Alpkäse, Vorarlberger Bergkäse, Großwalsertaler Bergkäse, and Sura Kees.

With the aim to support and preserve the local dairy production and the traditional agricultural heritage, the Bregenzerwald Cheese Route was founded in 1998. It is an organisation which connects farmers, traders and craftsmen. Along the cheese route, visitors are invited to watch the cheese production process and participate in culinary tastings.

Many cultural habits like Yodel, Alphorn or Schwingen were developed during this time. This seasonal nomadism led to the rich culture, architecture and love for nature found in Vorarlberg. A significant cultural icon unique to this area is the festive movement of cattle from the pastures to the villages in autumn. This tradition is especially popular with tourists.

=== Energy sector ===
The energy sector is one of the founders of Vorarlberg&#x27;s economy, in which hydropower is the most important source of energy. This is mainly used for the production of peak current. Vorarlberg was the first region in Europe where more sustainable energy was produced than consumed. Green electricity from Vorarlberg is therefore also sold to the German Westallgäu, to Switzerland and to other Austrian provinces. The largest electricity producer in Vorarlberg is illwerke VKW. They produce 75% of the electricity in Vorarlberg, mainly by hydropower.

=== Education ===
Two higher education institutions in Vorarlberg are the &quot;Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences&quot; () in Dornbirn and the (German: &quot;Pädagogische Hochschule Vorarlberg&quot;) in Feldkirch.

Originally founded as technical school in 1989, the Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences achieved status of an officially recognized university in 1999. It offers Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in business, engineering and technology, design and social work. About 1350 students have enrolled for the term 2018/19. The Fachhochschule Vorarlberg is considered one of Austria&#x27;s best applied universities in the field of technology.
The University College of Teacher Education Vorarlberg was founded in 2007 and offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in primary and secondary education. It also administers its own elementary and middle school, in which students from the university can complete their student teaching.

The vai Vorarlberger Architektur Institut is an interface in the field of Baukultur. It brings together architects, other design professionals and clients with craftspeople and actors from business, academia, the arts, culture and politics and address the issue of architectural quality through exhibitions, events and publications.

For professionals it is a platform for networking and training. For clients and all those interested in cultural issues it offers a source of ideas and inspiration, as well as an initial contact with architecture for children.

=== Transportation ===

==== Road ====
Vorarlberg is crossed in a north–south direction by a motorway, the Rheintal/Walgau Autobahn (A14). It connects with the Bundesautobahn 96 at the Austria–Germany border near Hörbranz and follows the Alpine Rhine Valley southwards to Feldkirch. It then continues south-eastwards along the river Ill to Bludenz, where it connects with the Arlberg Schnellstraße (S16) to Tyrol over the Arlberg. The A14 is linked with the A13 motorway in Switzerland via a road that crosses the Austria-Switzerland border at Lustenau/Au.

==== Rail ====

The main line is the Vorarlberg railway line, which traverses the state in north–south direction and which extends northwards into Germany. South of Bregenz, it connects with the St. Margrethen–Lauterach line, which leads towards Switzerland. In Feldkirch, the main line meets the Feldkirch–Buchs railway line to Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The Vorarlberg railway line&#x27;s southern terminus is Bludenz, where it meets the Arlberg Railway to Tyrol and the Bludenz–Schruns railway (&quot;Montafonerbahn&quot;) line to Schruns in the Montafon Valley. Most of these lines are owned and operated by Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). Since December 2023, WESTbahn also operates between Wien Westbahnhof and Bregenz. Regional train services are provided by Vorarlberg S-Bahn, with some lines being also part of Bodensee S-Bahn.

There are also two heritage railway lines: Bregenz Forest Railway and International Rhine Regulation Railway.

== Tourism ==
The tourist industry employs a considerable number of Vorarlbergers. There are around 12,000 employees working in this industry which represent approximately 11% of the total workforce (107,575 in 2015). Arrivals are slightly higher in winter (1.23 million in 2015) than in summer (1.14 million in 2015). The real difference lies in overnight-stays indicating that Vorarlberg is a strong winter destination. Overnight-stays in winter reach as high as 5.11 million which is quite large when compared to the summer season with 3.7 million overnight stays.

The largest (and best-known) touristic regions are:

* the Bregenzerwald
* the Bludenz-District
* the Arlberg region (including the high-class ski resorts Lech and Zürs)
* the Brandnertal
* the Montafon

=== Winter ===
The greatest tourist attractions are the mountains and the numerous ski resorts. In the cold season, winter sports enthusiasts will find ideal conditions for their favourite sport: skiing, cross country skiing, freeriding, snowboarding, ice skating, sled dog rides, carriage rides, tobogganing, snow and fun parks.

Vorarlberg&#x27;s largest ski resorts include:

* Ski Arlberg
** Stuben am Arlberg
** Lech-Zürs and Oberlech
** Warth and Schröcken
* Silvretta Montafon (Ski area)
* Kleinwalsertal
* Brandnertal
* Damüls-Mellau (Ski area)
* Diedamskopf
* Großes Walsertal/Fontanella-Faschina
* Klostertal

The ski resorts Silvretta Montafon and Ski Arlberg (which is partly located in Tyrol) are the two largest ski areas in Vorarlberg. Ski Arlberg is the largest connected ski area in Austria since the season of 2016/17. It offers 305 km of slopes and 111 lifts. It includes Lech, Zürs, Oberlech, Warth, Schröcken, Stuben and the Tyrolean municipalities of St. Anton and St. Christoph.

The places Lech and Zürs are known for their exclusivity and luxury, for which reason many prominent people go to these ski resorts. An example of this is the Dutch royal family which goes there on skiing holidays every year and has been staying in the prestigious &quot;Gasthof Post&quot; for four generations. A famous ski race is &quot;Der Weiße Ring&quot; (&#x27;The White Ring&#x27;) where skiers race from Lech to Zürs. The 22 km long route is named after its ring-shaped track and the snowy conditions in this region. It is considered to be particularly difficult.

The &quot;Ski Ride Vorarlberg&quot; is a combination of skiing, touring and freeriding while crossing Vorarlberg. The route starts in the Kleinwalsertal in the north, continues through the Bregenz Forest, over the Arlberg and the Klostertal to the Montafon valley in the south. The guided tour usually takes up to 7 days and is intended for experienced skiers.

Damüls-Mellau is a notable ski area in terms of reliable snow conditions. In 2007, Damüls was named &#x27;snowiest village in the world&#x27;. During the measuring period, the average snow height per winter season was approximately 9.30 m.

Skiers from these regions include Anita Wachter, Egon Zimmermann, Gerhard Nenning, Mario Reiter, Hubert Strolz, and Hannes Schneider, as well as the ski-jumper Toni Innauer.

=== Summer ===
In the summer, mountain sports like hiking, mountain biking, climbing and trail-running play a big role in Vorarlberg&#x27;s tourism. In total, Vorarlberg has more than 5,500 kilometers of hiking trails in different heights for both experienced and inexperienced walkers. Many ski areas operate cable cars throughout summer which makes them ideal for mountaineers.

All over Vorarlberg, themed hikes are being offered, e.g., culinary hikes, herbal walks, educational hikes for children, and night walks. The theme route &quot;Gauertaler AlpkulTour&quot;, which extends through the cultural landscape of the Montafon in the Rätikon mountains, is a popular walking route among tourists. Lake Constance is a pivot for hikers, pilgrims, fishers and bird watchers. For a long time, it has served as a reference point for important pilgrims&#x27; paths, including the Lake Constance walking path, parts of the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela and the European hiking routes E1, E4 and E5.

Offering some 1,500 kilometers of marked mountain bike trails, Vorarlberg attracts cyclists of all skill levels. Guided mountain bike tours are held in the Brandnertal and Klostertal. The Bregenzerwald bike school offers various bike-related activities including bike camps, technique courses and racing bike tours.

The Vorarlberg Circular Hiking Trail (&quot;Min Weag&quot; - My trail/path) offers a variety of cultural and natural spaces in six regions. The elevation profiles range from the rolling hills of the Bregenzerwald to above the tree line in the Silvretta and Rätikon. The trail was developed by Vorarlberg Tourism in collaboration with local mountain guides Markus Moosbrugger, Hanno Dönz and Helmut Düringer, based on an idea by Joe Metzler.

== Culture ==
===Language===
Owing to their location isolated from the rest of Austria, most Vorarlbergers speak a very distinct German dialect, the High Alemannic German, that other Austrians might have difficulty understanding, since the dialects in the rest of Austria form part of the Bavarian-Austrian language group, whereas the Vorarlberg dialect is part of the Alemannic dialect continuum. Alemannic dialects are also spoken in Liechtenstein, Switzerland (as Swiss German), Baden-Württemberg, the south west of Bavaria and the Alsace region of France. The Vorarlberg dialect is further divided into a number of regional sub-dialects (e.g. that of the Montafon, the Bregenzerwald and Lustenau are some of the most distinct) which tend to differ considerably from each other. In fact even within these regions the dialects may vary from one town or village to the next.

=== Traditional clothing ===
Traditional costumes (&quot;tracht&quot;) have a long history in Vorarlberg. Many valleys and villages have their own kind of garb, each with special characteristics from certain style periods. The Bregenzerwälder garb is the oldest, it originated in the 15/16th century and is also called &quot;d&#x27;Juppô&quot; (Bavarian: &quot;Juppe&quot;). The Montafon garb is inspired by the baroque era. A whole set of Tracht consists of several elements: the &quot;Juppe&quot; (the apron), a headgear (caps, hats), a blouse, a &quot;Tschopa&quot; (jacket), and stockings. The hairstyle (for example braided hair) can also be part of the Tracht.

In the 1970s, very few Vorarlbergers wore tracht. The reason for this was strict regulations with regard to the people wearing Tracht. For example, Bregenzerwälder ladies with short hair ought not to wear tracht, because their hair was too short for the suitable hair style (&quot;Wälderzöpfe&quot;). It was only when the regulations were loosened and the clothes were individualised in the 1990s that wearing tracht became more popular. Today, traditional garb is mainly worn on festive occasions. In the Juppenwerkstatt Riefensberg, tracht is still traditionally manufactured. There is a &quot;national association for people wearing traditional costume&quot; (&quot;Landestrachtenverband&quot;) that supports Vorarlberg&#x27;s Tracht wearing inhabitants and music chapels.

=== Cuisine ===
The influence of the Alemannic cuisine of neighbouring countries works more on Vorarlberg cuisine than Austrian cuisine. Cheese and other dairy products play a major role in traditional Vorarlberg meals. Typical dishes from the Vorarlberg region are: &quot;Käsespätzle&quot; or &quot;Käsknöpfle&quot; (noodles of flour and eggs with cheese and onion), &quot;Riebel&quot; (dish of corn and wheat semolina, served spicy or sweet), &quot;Flädlesuppe&quot; (broth with savoury pancake strips), &quot;Grumpara mit Käs&quot; (peel pastry with cheese), &quot;Öpfelküachle&quot; (apples baked in pancake dough, topped with sugar and cinnamon). &quot;Mostbröckle&quot; (pickled and smoked sausage), originally from Switzerland, is also a very popular product.

==== Regional dairy products ====
* Bergkäse (&quot;mountain cheese&quot;). The texture of the Bergkäse is rather hard, sometimes with small holes or cracks, with a strong taste, which is sometimes nutty. In the strict sense, Bergkäse is a cheese produced in the low mountain range (between 600 and 1500 m). Examples of Vorarlberg&#x27;s Bergkäse are the Vorarlberger Bergkäse or &quot;Großwalsertaler Bergkäse&quot; named &quot;Walserstolz&quot;.
* Alpkäse (&quot;mountain pasture cheese&quot; or &quot;alp cheese&quot;). Alpkäse is a hard cheese that resembles Bergkäse in taste and texture. The difference between these cheeses lies in the period and place of production. Bergkäse is produced year-round, so even in winter, when the animals are in the stables and fed with hay. Alpkäse is a seasonal product, only produced in the summer between May and September on high mountain meadows above 1500 m (Alpine pastures or alps), where the animals graze Alpine herbs. An example is the &quot;Vorarlberger Alpkäse&quot;.
* Sura Kees (&quot;sour cheese&quot;). Originally from the Montafon valley, Sura Kees has been known there since the 12th century and resembles the Tyrolean grey cheese. It is a low-fat cheese with a mild aroma reminiscent of cream cheese, its taste varies from mildly spicy to sour, always with a salty undertone. The Sura Kees is usually served with vinegar, oil and onions, or alone on black bread or eaten with potatoes.

=== Festivals and annual events ===
Vorarlberg provides cultural attractions of all kinds. The Bregenzer Festspiele is the best known festival of the region and poses one of Austria&#x27;s cultural highlights since 1946. It annually takes place in the months of July and August. With operas and musicals such as &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (&quot;The Magic Flute&quot;), &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot;, the Bregenzer Festspiele draws hundreds of thousands of spectators every year. Noteworthy is the &quot;Seebühne&quot;, an impressive stage in Lake Constance where scenes are played.

=== Architecture ===
==== The baroque masters of the Guild of Au in the 17th/18th century ====
In 1651, Michael Beer founded the Auer Zunft (Guild of Au) which is an important community of Vorarlberg builders, sculptors and carpenters who specialized in baroque building. In Au-Schoppernau from 1670 to 1700, more than 90 percent of all male workers were builders. Master builders and craftsmen from the Bregenz Forest in particular, but also from other parts of today&#x27;s Vorarlberg, played a leading role in the 600 churches and monasteries that were built in the Baroque style in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The master craftsmen of Au trained over 1,800 apprentices during a long construction boom which followed the Thirty Years&#x27; War. These new master builders were active throughout the Lake Constance area, but also in Alsace, Bohemia and the South German region. Well-known works by baroque master builders include the monasteries and churches in Birnau, Weingarten and Einsiedeln.

Many important members of the Auer Zunft came from the architect families Beer, Moosbrugger and Thumb.

==== Traditional architecture ====
The independent architecture of the Bregenzerwälderhaus, the Montafonerhaus, the Rheintalhaus from the Dornbirn region and the &quot;Walserhaus&quot; are particularly relevant to historical architecture. Their designs trace back to the 15th century. The traditional materials used for building these houses are stone and wood. They are important features of the mountainous Alpine landscape.

==== Art Nouveau ====
The style that dominated in Vorarlberg at the turn of the century is characterised by the &quot;Heimatstil&quot;, the Southern German variant of Art Nouveau. An example for this style is the Löwenapotheke in the Rathausstraße in Bregenz by Otto Mallaun. Other notable representatives of Art Nouveau architecture in Vorarlberg are: Ernst Dittrich in Feldkirch (e.g., Feldkirch&#x27;s Regional Court, State Directorate of Finances) and Hanns Kornberger in Dornbirn (e.g., the mansions &quot;Grabenweg Nr. 8&quot; and &quot;Schulgasse Nr. 17)&quot; and in Hohenems (e.g., the former hospital).

==== Neue Vorarlberger Bauschule and contemporary architecture ====
The Neue Vorarlberger Bauschule evolved organically the second half of the 20th century, always involving craftsmen and locals in the building process. Today, it is regarded as one of the most important pioneers of the New Alpine architecture. With the typical architecture of Vorarlberg still recognizable, it combines tradition and modernity: clean lines, glass and local wood. Its harmonious mix creates interesting contrasts as in half-timbered houses. Comfort and quality of life are important criteria. Currently, many private houses and public buildings are renovated by architects, favoring local timber and limiting energy expenditure. Well-known award-winning architectural projects include the Kunsthaus Bregenz, vorarlberg museum in Bregenz, Michelehof Hard and Hotel Krone Hittisau.

Contemporary architecture in Vorarlberg has made a label for a demanding architecture of a fruitful confrontation between traditional construction and modern interpretation. Some examples of more recent architecture are:

* vorarlberg museum in Bregenz: The museum by Cukrowicz Nachbaur Architekten was awarded the International Architecture Award 2014, Best Architect&#x27;s Award 2014 in gold, Vorarlberg Client Award 2015, Austrian Museum Award 2016, among others.
* Kunsthaus Bregenz: The Kunsthaus was built by the Swiss architect and Pritzker Prize winner Peter Zumthor, received the Mies van der Rohe Award in 1998.
* LifeCycle-Tower ONE (LCT ONE) in Dornbirn: From 2010 onwards, Vorarlberg had been investing in research on renewable energy sources and energy-efficient houses in order to achieve self-set climate targets. In 2012, the first modular wooden hybrid complex of eight floors was built: the LifeCycle-Tower I. It is 27 m high and made of wood and concrete. In this architectural design, load-bearing elements are not covered. The benefits of this innovative project are environmental and energy efficiency, 90% less CO2 emissions, a much shorter construction and industrial production time of the components.
* in Krumbach: In 2014, the municipality of Krumbach in the Bregenz Forest constructed seven bus stops that were designed by international architect offices in partnership with local partner architects and craftsmen. The project goes under the name of . These extraordinary bus stops received special recognition as part of the Austrian National Architecture Awards as well as the National Award for PR.
* Skyspace Lech in Oberlech: A skyspace is an enclosed space which is open to the sky through a large hole in the ceiling. The architectural design puts the colour-changing light at the walls and in the sky during sunrise and sunset into focus. The Skyspace Lech is a walk-in art installation by James Turrell in Oberlech.
* Montforthaus Feldkirch: The convention centre was re-opened in 2015. The Montforthaus is a public venue for balls, conventions, concerts and theatre performances.

==== Architectural initiatives ====
The Werkraum Bregenzerwald is an association of craftsmen in the Bregenzerwald founded in 1999. It aims at networking and supporting craft, design and technology businesses in the area. The publicly accessible place is used to present the craftsmanship, to promote building culture in cooperation with architects and to increase design competence and quality of craftsmanship with the preferred involvement of young people.

Occupying the Werkraum Bregenzerwald since 2014, the travelling exhibition &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; demonstrates the quality of Vorarlberg&#x27;s architecture by means of 230 selected projects. It offers a distinct view of how building culture has evolved from the late 1950s until the present. Organized by the Austrian Cultural Forum network, the exhibition will be shown in over 20 locations around the world.

==== Architecture trails ====
The Vorarlberg Institute for Architecture (VAI) and the &quot;Vorarlberg Tourist Board&quot; collaborated for the development of the so-called architecture trails. Each trail has a different theme: &quot;New impressions&quot;, &quot;Art and culture&quot;, &quot;Timber and loam&quot;, &quot;Old and new&quot;, &quot;Revitalised villages&quot; and &quot;Architecture and landscape&quot;. These tours take visitors to both urban and rural regions in order to illustrate architectural variety in Vorarlberg by select examples. These examples are characterized by a functional mix, spatial versatility, formal radicalism, ecological far-sightedness and social integration.

<text>Bocage (, ) is a terrain of mixed woodland and pasture characteristic of parts of northern France, southern England, Ireland, the Netherlands, northern Spain and northern Germany, in regions where pastoral farming is the dominant land use.
&quot;Bocage&quot; may also refer to a small forest, a decorative element of leaves, or a type of rubble-work, comparable with the English use of &quot;rustic&quot; in relation to garden ornamentation. In the decorative arts, especially porcelain, it refers to a leafy screen spreading above and behind figures. Though found on continental figures, it is something of an English speciality, beginning in the mid-18th century, especially in Chelsea porcelain, and later spreading to more downmarket Staffordshire pottery figures. 

In English, &quot;bocage&quot; refers to a terrain of mixed woodland and pasture, with fields and winding country lanes sunken between narrow low ridges and banks surmounted by tall thick hedgerows that break the wind but also limit visibility. It is the sort of landscape found in many parts of southern England, for example the Devon hedge and Cornish hedge. However the term is more often found in technical than general usage in England. In France the term is in more general use, especially in Normandy, with a similar meaning. Bocage landscape in France is largely confined to Normandy, Brittany, Burgundy and parts of the Loire valley.

==Etymology==

&quot;Bocage&quot; is a Norman word that comes from the Old Norman &quot;boscage&quot; (Anglo-Norman , Old French ), from the Old French root &quot;bosc&quot; (&quot;wood&quot;) &gt; Modern French (&quot;wood&quot;) cf. Medieval Latin (first mentioned in 704 AD). The Norman place names retain it as &quot;Bosc-&quot;, &quot;-bosc&quot;, &quot;Bosc-&quot;, pronounced traditionally or . The suffix &quot;-age&quot; means &quot;a general thing&quot;. The &quot;boscage&quot; form was used in English for &quot;growing trees or shrubs; a thicket, grove; woody undergrowth&quot; and to refer to decorative design imitating branches and foliage or leafy decoration such as is found on eighteenth-century porcelain; since early twentieth century this usually called &quot;bocage&quot;. Similar words occur in Scandinavian (cf. Swedish ; Danish ) and other Germanic languages (cf. Dutch , ); the original root is thought to be the Proto-Germanic &quot;*bŏsk-&quot;. The &quot;boscage&quot; form seems to have developed its meaning under the influence of eighteenth-century romanticism.

The 1934 &quot;Nouveau Petit Larousse&quot; defined &quot;bocage&quot; as &quot;a &quot;bosquet&quot;, a little wood, an agreeably shady wood&quot; and a &quot;bosquet&quot; as &quot;a little wood, a clump of trees&quot;. By 2006, the &quot;Petit Larousse&quot; definition had become &quot;(Norman word) Region where the fields and meadows are enclosed by earth banks carrying hedges or rows of trees and where the habitation is generally dispersed in farms and hamlets.&quot;

==Historic role==
===England===
In southeast England, in spite of a sedimentary soil which would not fit this landscape, a bocage resulted from the movement to enclose what were once open fields.

During the 17th century, England developed an ambitious sea policy. One of the effects of this was the importation of Russian wheat, which was cheaper than English wheat at that time.
The enclosures common in the bocage countryside favoured sheep husbandry and limited English cereal grain production, and as a consequence of this policy, the rural exodus was amplified, accelerating the Industrial Revolution.
The surplus of agricultural workers migrated to the cities to work in factories.

===Normandy===
In Normandy, the bocage acquired a particular significance in the Chouannerie during the French Revolution.

The bocage was also significant during the Battle of Normandy in World War II, as it made progress against the German defenders difficult. Plots of land were divided by ancient rows of dirt alongside drainage ditches; thick vegetation on these dirt mounds could create walls up to 16 feet/4.8 metres high. A typical square mile on the battlefield might contain hundreds of irregular hedged enclosures.
In response, &quot;Rhino tanks&quot; fitted with bocage-cutting modifications were developed. American personnel usually referred to bocages as hedgerows. The German army also used sunken lanes to implement strong points and defences to stop the American troops on the Cotentin Peninsula and around the town of Saint-Lô.

===Ireland===

Almost all of lowland Ireland is characterised by bocage landscape, a consequence of pastoral farming which requires enclosure for the management of herds. Approximately 5% of Ireland&#x27;s land area is devoted to hedges, field walls and shelterbelts. In the more fertile areas these usually consist of earthen banks, which are planted with or colonised by trees and shrubs; this vegetation can give the impression of a wooded landscape, even where there is little or no woodland. This pattern of hedgerows was largely established in the late 18th and 19th centuries, a period when Ireland was virtually devoid of natural woodland. Modern intensive agriculture has tended to increase field size by removing hedgerows, a trend which for years was promoted by the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union and recently has been countered by the European Union&#x27;s agricultural policies favouring the conservation of wildlife habitats.

<doc id="161792" wikidata="Q3127834" url="?curid=161792" title="Harry Hill">
<text>Matthew Keith Hall (born 1 October 1964), known professionally as Harry Hill, is an English comedian, presenter and writer. He pursued a career in stand-up following years working as a medical doctor, developing an offbeat, energetic performance style that fused elements of surrealism, observational comedy, slapstick, satire and music. When performing, he usually wears browline glasses and a dress shirt with a distinctive oversized collar and cuffs.

He won the Perrier Award for Best Newcomer at the 1992 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and began his career in radio and television comedy with the radio series &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Fruit Corner&quot; (1993–1997). He has hosted his own television comedy shows &quot;Harry Hill&quot; (1997–2003) and &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot; (2001–2012), and narrated &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot; from 2004 to 2022. His other projects include &quot;The Harry Hill Movie&quot;, released in 2013.

==Early life, education and medical career==
Hill was born in Woking, Surrey on 1 October 1964 and grew up in Staplehurst, Kent, where he attended the local primary school. At the age of 14, Hill moved with his family to Hong Kong for two years and attended Island School there. He was later educated at Angley School and then Cranbrook School in Kent and St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School. He received his MBBS medical degree from the University of London in 1988. Hill worked as a Proctologist at Doncaster Royal Infirmary, before quitting the medical profession because he &quot;didn&#x27;t feel in control of what was happening&quot;; he is still registered on the General Medical Council&#x27;s list of Registered Medical Practitioners.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, Hill nearly returned to work at the temporary NHS Nightingale Hospital London, after filling in the form after &quot;A few drinks&quot;. He was asked if he could start immediately due to his last medical specialism being in Respiratory Emergencies. However, he turned down the role due to travel issues.

==Career==
===&quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Fruit Corner&quot; (1993–1997)===

Hill achieved his breakthrough in 1992, when he won the Perrier Award for Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Shortly after, a radio show starring Hill was commissioned by BBC Radio 4 entitled &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Fruit Corner&quot;. Hill hosted the show as himself, and each week he was joined by various guest performers, as well as regular character actors including Al Murray and Burt Kwouk. The show featured a variety of other celebrity guests during its run including Rolf Harris and Ronnie Corbett. Each episode is interspersed with Hill&#x27;s stand-up routines. &quot;Fruit Corner&quot; ran for four series on BBC Radio 4.

===&quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Fruit Fancies&quot; (1994)===
Hill made his television breakthrough in 1994, when he starred in BBC2 black-and-white silent comedy series &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Fruit Fancies&quot;. In a similar format to &quot;Fruit Corner&quot;, Hill performed a series of sketches, with celebrity guests making cameo appearances.

The series ran for six episodes on BBC2 between October and December 1994. For Christmas that year, a VHS containing a 100-minute compilation of the best material from the series, as well as unseen sketches, was released by BBC Video.

===&quot;Saturday Live&quot; (1996)===
Hill was a regular on &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, which was broadcast in 1996 on ITV for eight episodes.

===&quot;Harry Hill&quot; (1997–2003)===

Harry Hill got his own television series on Channel 4 in 1997. Among the regular characters were Harry Hill&#x27;s big brother, Alan, played by Al Murray, and his adopted son, Alan Jr., played by Matt Bradstock. Burt Kwouk also appeared in many episodes as Harry&#x27;s &quot;Chicken Catcher&quot; – and each week, he would come up with an excuse as to why he has not yet captured a chicken, followed by a performance of the song &quot;Hey Little Hen&quot;. In later series, Hill and Kwouk appeared in sketches as Karl Lagerfeld and Gianni Versace.

Hill&#x27;s screen wife Mai Sung also made several appearances on the show, mainly on the theme of trying to steal his Abbey National bank savings book. Another character that featured on the show was Stouffer the Cat, a glove puppet cat made from blue rubber. Stouffer would normally sit in a throne, supported by a rubber arm in the style of Rod Hull, and was employed to intimidate guests during Hill&#x27;s standup routines. Some of Stouffer&#x27;s catchphrases are &quot;he got a big face&quot; and &quot;sorted – respect due&quot;.

At the end of each episode, an event called &quot;The Badger Parade&quot; was supposed to take place. The parade featured a number of puppet badgers that included &quot;Gareth Southgate badger&quot; and &quot;Tasmin Archer badger&quot;, among others – however, every week, there would be some kind of problem, resulting in the badgers being unable to perform. In place of the badger parade, Hill would usually sing a song, with a guest that he had invited onto the show. A tie-in book relating to the series was released in October 1998, entitled &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Fun Book&quot;.

The series was cancelled in April 2000 but was revived by ITV in March 2003, as &quot;The All-New Harry Hill Show&quot;. It was broadcast along with episodes of &quot;TV Burp&quot;. Regular features on the ITV version included the Hamilton Challenge, featuring Neil and Christine Hamilton, and a butterfly in blue jeans. The Channel 4 series was revisited in August 2012, for a retrospective documentary entitled &quot;Whatever Happened to Harry Hill?&quot;.

===&quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot; (2001–2012)===

In October 2001, Hill moved to ITV in a lucrative deal, in which he created an all-new show, &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot;, where he would take a look at the week&#x27;s television, showing clips from various British television programmes, and framing them with funny commentary or intercutting additional footage.

The series would feature a regular stable of all new characters, including the Knitted Character, a small knitted rabbit, Wagbo, a demon love child whose parents are reportedly Wagner Carillho and Mary Byrne of &quot;X Factor&quot; fame, and an interpretation of Heather Trott from &quot;EastEnders&quot;, played by Steve Bernham, as well as a doll of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; star Alan Sugar, who would regularly rap before clips of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; were introduced.

The show was piloted in December 2001, before running for fifteen full series between 2002 and 2012, before being cancelled to allow Hill to work on other projects. Hill would occasionally say his catchphrase &quot;Chippy chips!&quot; and the show became known for another catchphrase &quot;You get the idea with that&quot; and Hill&#x27;s actual sideways look at a topic. The show won a number of BAFTA awards, and spawned five &quot;Best of TV Burp&quot; DVD compilations, and a book based on the series, which was released for Christmas 2009.

===&quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot; (2004–2022)===

From 2004 to 2022, Hill narrated 15 series of the comical clip show &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot;, often shortened to &quot;YBF!&quot;, replacing Jonathan Wilkes on the show. In February 2023, it was reported that the show had been axed by ITV.

===&quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Shark Infested Custard&quot; (2005)===

In October 2005, Hill wrote and starred in &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Shark Infested Custard&quot;, a thirteen-part show broadcast in the CITV children&#x27;s television slot, on ITV. While many of his well-known characters, such as Stouffer and Garry Hill, his fictional layabout son from his first marriage, remained, it also showcased several new characters, including Speed Camera Boy, an outsider who is half boy and half speed camera, and Evelynne Hussey, a one-woman band who played a number of different instruments.

While the show featured a game-show element, &quot;Help the Aged&quot;, it was very similar in structure to &quot;Harry Hill&quot;. In the show, Hill wore a pale yellow, custard-coloured shirt, with a giant collar, instead of his usual white collar.

The series was never released on DVD; however, it did spawn &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Whopping Great Joke Book&quot;, a book of children&#x27;s jokes, released in 2006. The book was also made available as an iPhone application. A second book, &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Bumper Book of Bloopers&quot;, was released for Christmas 2011.

===&quot;The Harry Hill Movie&quot; (2013)===

&quot;The Harry Hill Movie&quot; premiered in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2013. The film also stars Matt Lucas, Julie Walters, Johnny Vegas, Sheridan Smith, Simon Bird, Marc Wootton, Jim Broadbent, and band The Magic Numbers. The film sees Hill embark on a road trip to Blackpool with his Nan (Julie Walters) when he discovers that his hamster has only one week to live.

The 88-minute film was directed by Steve Bendelack and made $3,647,870 at the box office. It was also released on DVD on 14 April 2014.

===&quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; (2015)===

Hill presented a revived version of the ITV talent show &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;. The series aired for six episodes from 10 January until 14 February 2015. The revival has proved divisive. Fans of the original format were extremely critical of it, saying that Hill had made the show about himself rather than the contestants.

In April 2015, it was announced that the show had been axed by ITV, due to extremely poor ratings.

===&quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Tea Time&quot; (2016–2018)===
&quot;Tea Time&quot; saw Hill welcome guests to a spoof comedy kitchen and ask them to cook bizarre things. A new entertainment series for Sky 1, the first series debuted on 16 October 2016, and was viewed by 400,000 viewers. Ratings slipped the following week, when only 180,000 watched. Guests for the first series included Paul Hollywood, Joey Essex, Gok Wan, Martin Kemp and Jason Donovan.

&quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Tea Time&quot; was commissioned for a second series which began airing in January 2018.

===&quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Alien Fun Capsule&quot; (2017–2019)===
In March 2017, Hill began presenting six thirty-minute episode of &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Alien Fun Capsule&quot;, which aired on ITV on Thursday nights, 8.30 to 9 pm.

The panel show sees Harry welcoming two teams of two celebrity guests as they are tasked with saving planet Earth from alien invasion by sending evidence (via the &quot;fun capsule&quot; of the title) that Earthlings are good fun and therefore worthy of saving from destruction. Harry alludes to the premise of the show as being rather tenuous in a running joke during each show&#x27;s introduction, before introducing the two teams of guests, usually a mix of comedians and television stars.

In a similar style to &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot;, the show includes various clips from television and film, often attributed or related somehow to the current guests. The guests also partake in sketches and songs based on or directly spoofing the funny or bizarre items featured. There is a regular slot entitled &quot;Local News Round Up&quot;, accompanied by its own theme tune, which involves each of the guests taking turns to read out bizarre headlines from local newspapers. Alan the Alien also appears as a green extra-terrestrial&#x27;s arm, emerging from a box to aid Harry in some way.

Guests on the show included George Formby Society, Alison Hammond and Les Dennis.

The series has received positive reviews, with many pointing out the similarities to &quot;TV Burp&quot;.

The show moved to Saturday evenings between 7.30 pm and 8.00 pm for a second series, aired in 2018, and a third in 2019.

===&quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s World of TV&quot; (2020)===

In 2020, Harry Hill started presenting &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s World of TV&quot;. Using archive clips, this &quot;TV Burp&quot;-style show pokes fun at television, with each episode themed around a specific genre.

===Novels===
In 2002, Hill published a novel entitled &quot;Flight from Deathrow&quot;, based around the unlikely fictional antics of real-life celebrities and politicians, as seen through the eyes of a storyteller who drifts in and out of a coma. His second book, &quot;Tim the Tiny Horse&quot;, was published in October 2006, and featured the tale of a small horse who has to wear glasses because of poor eyesight.

Hill&#x27;s third book, &quot;The Further Adventures of the Queen Mum&quot;, was published in October 2007, and was a comic take on the life and times of the Queen Mother. His fourth novel, &quot;Tim the Tiny Horse at Large&quot;, which is a sequel to &quot;Tim the Tiny Horse&quot;, was published in October 2009.

In 2010, Hill released &quot;Livin&#x27; the Dreem&quot;, a fictional account of a year in his life with frequent references to pop culture. The book was reprinted in May 2011, with additional entries for events occurring between January and April of that year.

&quot;A Complete History of Tim (the Tiny Horse)&quot; was published in November 2012 which contains the first two &quot;Tim the Tiny Horse&quot; novels, with four new stories.

===Other projects===
Hill has recorded voice-overs on television commercials. Advertisements that Hill has provided a voice over for include the holiday adverts for Boots in 2004, the &quot;Bring on the Branston!&quot; adverts for the Branston Pickle brand during 2006 to 2007, adverts for the Green Flag car breakdown service, and adverts for the new yogurt, &quot;Danio by Danone&quot;. He also sang in 2001 &quot;This Charming Man&quot; by The Smiths as Morrissey in Stars in their Eyes.

In February 2001, and again in April, Hill appeared on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;. Hill has also appeared as a guest on the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, in the &quot;ChuckleVision&quot; episode &quot;Mind Your Manors&quot;, the first episode of the twentieth series, and as Joon Boolay in the Sky Atlantic sitcom &quot;This is Jinsy&quot;. Between July and October 2003, Hill presented a Sunday morning comedy and music show on Capital Radio called &quot;Funch&quot;. In October 2006, Hill presented his own episode of long running ITV series, &quot;An Audience With...&quot;, in which he revived several characters from &quot;Harry Hill&quot;. On 4 October 2004, he also appeared in an episode of &quot;Room 101&quot;.

In November 2010, Hill released his debut comic album, &#x27;Funny Times&#x27;. The album was preceded by the singles &#x27;I Wanna Baby&#x27;, &#x27;SuBo&#x27;, and &#x27;Ken!&#x27;, which features William Roache, as his &quot;Coronation Street&quot; character, Ken Barlow, is the feature of the song. Since October 2010, Hill has had his own comic strip in &quot;The Dandy&quot;, entitled &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Real Life Adventures in TV Land&quot;, drawn by Nigel Parkinson. Hill was directly involved in its creation and is co-credited with Parkinson. Between October and December 2010, Hill starred in a weekly online comedy series on the ChannelFlip website, entitled &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Little Internet Show&quot;. Ten episodes of the show were broadcast online.

==Awards==
In 2003, &quot;The Observer&quot; listed Hill as one of the fifty funniest acts in British comedy.

He also won again in 2011, but was unable to be there and sent Wagbo to collect it on his behalf. He was also nominated for 3 other awards, including the People&#x27;s Choice Award, which was won by Miranda Hart.

<text>Brown Peak is a stratovolcano and the highest point of the Balleny Islands. It is situated on the northern part of Sturge Island. Recent research suggests this may be as high as 2170m.

==Discovery and naming==
John Balleny discovered Brown Peak in February 1839, and named it for W. Brown, a merchant who provided financial support to the Enderby Brothers&#x27; expedition. In 1841, Captain James Clark Ross, who sighted the islands on his own expedition to Antarctica, gave it the name Russell Peak.

==Possible 2001 eruption==

Satellite imagery suggests that an eruption may have occurred on or about 12 June 2001.

<text>Sturge Island is one of the three main islands in the uninhabited Balleny Islands group located in the Southern Ocean. It lies southeast of Buckle Island and north-east of Belousov Point on the Antarctic mainland. The island, in Oates Land, also forms part of the Ross Dependency, claimed by New Zealand.

==Description==
The island is roughly a parallelogram in shape, with long east and west coasts and shorter coasts facing north-west and south-east. Of volcanic origin, it is about in width, with a maximum length of , between Cape Freeman in the north and Cape Smyth in the south. It is mostly covered by ice and snow throughout the year. The island&#x27;s highest point reaches with the unclimbed stratovolcano Brown Peak, the highest point in the Balleny chain.

==Discovery and naming==
The Balleny Islands were discovered by British mariner John Balleny in 1839. Sturge Island was named after Thomas Sturge, one of the London merchants who had financed Balleny&#x27;s expedition.

==Important Bird Area==
A 4,655 ha site on the island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports extensive breeding colonies of southern fulmars and snow petrels on ice free cliffs along the western and northern coasts.

As early as March 1933, two months after Hitler was appointed Chancellor, the Sturmabteiling began to attack trade union offices without legal consequences. Several union offices were occupied, their furnishings were destroyed, their documents were stolen or burned, and union members were beaten and in some cases killed; the police ignored these attacks and declared itself without jurisdiction. These early attacks occurred at random, carried out spontaneously by rank-and-file Nazis motivated by a desire to destroy Marxism, and the Nazi Party leadership only implemented a general policy in May. On 2 May, 1933, trade union headquarters throughout Germany were occupied, their funds were confiscated, and the unions were officially abolished and their leaders arrested. Many union leaders were beaten and sent to concentration camps, including some who had previously agreed to cooperate with the Nazis.

The German Labour Front (DAF) was then created in May 1933 as the organization that was to take over the assets seized from the former trade unions. Robert Ley, who had no previous experience in labour relations, was appointed by Hitler to lead the DAF upon its creation. Three weeks later, Hitler issued a decree that banned collective bargaining and stated that a group of labour trustees, appointed by him, would &quot;regulate labour contracts&quot; and maintain &quot;labour peace.&quot; This decree effectively outlawed strikes, since workers could not oppose the decisions of the trustees. Meanwhile, Robert Ley promised &quot;to restore absolute leadership to the natural leader of a factory—that is, the employer... Only the employer can decide.&quot;

The leadership of the DAF stressed that there was no need for antagonism between workers and employers in the new Nazi state. To underline this, its laws were couched in a neo-feudal language of reciprocity. This new system of industrial relations represented a major victory for the employers, backed by the Nazi leadership, who needed the co-operation of industry in their drive to rearm.

Unlike the trade unions it had replaced, the DAF did not aim to be an organization representing the interests of workers alone; it also included employers and members of the professions, and defined itself as &quot;the organization of creative Germans of brain and fist.&quot; The law establishing the DAF stated that its aim was not to protect workers but &quot;to create a true social and productive community of all Germans&quot; and &quot;to see that every single individual should be able to perform the maximum of work.&quot; The labour trustees, who had the power to set wages, in practice followed the wishes of employers and did not even consult the workers. There was also a mandate from Hitler to keep wages low, as he declared that the hourly wage should remain the same and workers should only be able to earn more through increased productivity. Although Germany experienced an economic recovery throughout the 1930s and employment greatly increased, wages remained as low as they had been during the Great Depression, and sometimes even lower.

The DAF also gave employers the ability to prevent their workers from seeking different jobs. In February 1935, the &quot;workbook&quot; system was introduced, which issued every worker with a workbook that recorded his skills and past employment. These workbooks were required for employment and they were kept by the employer; if a worker desired to quit his job, the employer could refuse to release his workbook, preventing the worker from being legally employed anywhere else.

To compensate for these restrictions on wages and employment, the DAF sought to provide workers with leisure and entertainment. Robert Ley explained his policy as aiming to &quot;divert the attention of the masses from material to moral values,&quot; as he believed that &quot;it is more important to feed the souls of men than their stomachs.&quot; Thus, the DAF established the Strength Through Joy organisation, which provided factory libraries and concerts, swimming pools, adult education programmes, variety performances, theatre visits, athletic events, subsidized tickets to the opera, and subsidised vacations with a focus on cruises. The number of people taking holiday cruises went from 2.3 million in 1934 to 10.3 million in 1938.

The DAF financed the building of ocean-going vessels that permitted German workers to pay minimal prices to sail to many foreign destinations. Up to six ocean liners were operating just before the start of World War II. According to the chief of the Associated Press in Berlin, Louis P. Lochner, ticket prices for ocean steamer vessels ranged from twelve to sixteen marks for &quot;a full week on such a steamer&quot;. For those who desired vacations closer to home, the DAF constructed spa and summer resort complexes. The most ambitious was the 4.5 km long Prora complex on Rugen island, which was to have 20,000 beds, and would have been the largest beach resort in the world. It was never completed and the massive complex largely remained an empty shell right through until the 21st century.

The DAF was one of the largest Nazi organizations, boasting of over 35,000 full-time employees by 1939. It operated one of the largest financial institutions—the Bank of German Labour—as well as various workplace programmes such as medical screening, occupational training, legal assistance and the Beauty of Labour organization. To help Hitler keep his promise to have every German capable of owning an affordable car (Volkswagen—the People&#x27;s Car) the DAF subsidised the construction of an automobile factory, which was partially paid from workers&#x27; payroll deductions. None of the 340,000 workers who were paying for a car ever received one, since the factory had to be retooled for war production after Nazi Germany invaded Poland.

DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Furthermore, many unemployed people were drafted into the Labour Front where they were given uniforms and tools and put to work; the disappearance of unemployed people from the streets contributed to the perception that the Nazis were improving the economic conditions of Germany. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 Rpf. to , depending on the category a member fell into, on a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total DAF revenue from fees was . In US dollars, the annual income from dues to the Labour Front came to $160,000,000 in 1937 and $200,000,000 by 1939.

==Organization==

There were two main components of the DAF:
* &quot;Nationalsozialistische Betriebszellenorganisation&quot; (NSBO; National Socialist Factory Cell Organization)
* &quot;Nationalsozialistische Handels- und Gewerbeorganisation&quot; (NSHAGO; National Socialist Trade and Industry Organization)

Several other sub-organizations were set up, including:
*&quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot; (KdF; Strength through Joy) – Organization giving the workers cheap/free holidays in addition to subsidised sporting and leisure facilities.
*&quot;Schönheit der Arbeit&quot; (SdA; Beauty of Labour) – Aimed to make workplaces more enticing to workers (e.g., renovations of outdated factories, new canteens for workers, smoking-free rooms, cleaner working spaces etc.).

The Front also organised the &quot;Reichsberufswettkampf&quot;, a national vocational competition.

<text>The Elymians () were an ancient tribal people who inhabited the western part of Sicily during the Bronze Age and Classical antiquity.

==Origins==
According to Thucydides, the Elymians were refugees coming from the destroyed Troy. Instead for Hellanicus of Lesbos they arrived in Sicily coming from Italy, driven out by the Oenotrians. Furthermore for the Greek historian, the Elymians would also have contributed to the formation of the Sicels. 

Today the thesis for an Italic origin of the Elymians is the most accredited, with the support of linguistic studies. Elymian, a language for which a different affiliation has long been sought in the past, indeed must be attributed to the Indo-European linguistic family; the ancient tradition according to which the Elymians came from Troy - so the theory of an Anatolian people - is corroborated by linguistic and archeological data; however a generally supported opinion see in Elymian an Italic language more or less similar to Latin. 

Greek historian Philistus refers to the presence of a people of Ligurian origin, although he does not identify it with the Elymians. In modern times, historians such as Heinrich Nissen and Karl Julius Beloch investigated the possibilities of a Ligurian origin following the numerous common epigraphic and toponymic references, still found in the cities of Lerici, Segesta and Entella.

Apart from mythological tales, there is little known about the identity and culture of the Elymians. They are indistinguishable from their Sicani neighbours in the archaeological record of the early Iron Age (c. 1100–c. 700 BC). Thereafter they appear to have adopted many aspects of the culture of the Greek colonists of Sicily, erecting the temple at Segesta and using the Greek alphabet to write their own language. As yet, no one has succeeded in deciphering the Elymian language.
==History==

The Elymians maintained friendly relations (and alliances) with Carthage but came into frequent conflict with the expansionist Greek colonies of western Sicily, especially Selinus. Boundary disputes with Selinus broke out into open warfare on several occasions after 580 BC. They sought to ally first with Athens against Selinus, provoking the disastrous Sicilian expedition of 415–413 BC. Following this failure they encouraged the Carthaginians to attack Selinus in 409 BC and succeeded in obtaining the destruction of their rivals.

However, they turned on Carthage during the First Punic War and allied with Rome instead. The Elymians were granted a privileged status under Roman rule and were exempted from taxes. This was said to have been in recognition of the Elymians&#x27; claim of Trojan ancestry, which was seen as making them cousins of the Roman people, who also claimed to have been descended from the Trojans. The Elymians appear to have largely disappeared from view under Roman rule, presumably becoming assimilated into the general Sicilian population.

==Areas of settlement==

The Elymi shared western Sicily with the Sicani, the Phoenicians, and later the Greeks. Their three most important cities were Segesta, the political centre; Eryx (the modern Erice), a religious centre; and Entella. Other cities were Elima, Halyciae (referred to as &quot;Alicia&quot; in modern Italian sources), Iaitas, Hypana, and Drepanon.

<doc id="161803" wikidata="Q316307" url="?curid=161803" title="Giovanni Battista Piranesi">
<text>Giovanni Battista (or Giambattista) Piranesi (; also known as simply Piranesi; 4 October 1720 – 9 November 1778) was an Italian classical archaeologist, architect, and artist, famous for his etchings of Rome and of fictitious and atmospheric &quot;prisons&quot; (&quot;Carceri d&#x27;invenzione&quot;). He was the father of Francesco Piranesi, Laura Piranesi and Pietro Piranesi.

==Biography==
Piranesi was born in Venice, in the parish of San Moisè, where he was baptised. His father was a stonemason. His brother Andrea introduced him to Latin literature and ancient Greco-Roman civilization, and later he was apprenticed under his uncle, Matteo Lucchesi, who was a leading architect in the &quot;Magistrato alle Acque&quot;, the state organization responsible for engineering and restoring historical buildings.

From 1740, he had an opportunity to work in Rome as a draughtsman for Marco Foscarini, the Venetian ambassador (and future Doge of Venice) to the new Pope Benedict XIV. He resided in the Palazzo Venezia and studied under Giuseppe Vasi, who introduced him to the art of etching and engraving of the city and its monuments. Giuseppe Vasi found Piranesi&#x27;s talent was much greater than that of a mere engraver. According to Legrand, Vasi told Piranesi that &quot;you are too much of a painter, my friend, to be an engraver.&quot;
After his studies with Vasi, he collaborated with pupils of the French Academy in Rome to produce a series of &quot;vedute&quot; (views) of the city; his first work was &quot;Prima parte di Architettura e Prospettive&quot; (1743), followed in 1745 by &quot;Varie Vedute di Roma Antica e Moderna&quot;.

In 1752 Piranesi married Angela Pasquini, with their son Francesco born in 1758/1759.

From 1743 to 1747, he was mainly in Venice where, according to some sources, he often visited Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, a leading artist in Venice. It was Tiepolo who expanded the restrictive conventions of reproductive, topographical and antiquarian engravings. He then returned to Rome, where he opened a workshop in Via del Corso. In 1748–1774, he created an important series of &quot;vedute&quot; of the city which established his fame. In the meantime Piranesi devoted himself to the measurement of many of the ancient buildings: this led to the publication of &quot;Le Antichità Romane de&#x27; tempo della prima Repubblica e dei primi imperatori&quot; (&quot;Roman Antiquities of the Time of the First Republic and the First Emperors&quot;). In 1761, he became a member of the Accademia di San Luca and opened a printing house of his own. In 1762, the &quot;Campo Marzio dell&#x27;antica Roma&quot; collection of engravings was printed.
The following year he was commissioned by Pope Clement XIII to restore the choir of San Giovanni in Laterano, but the work did not materialize. In 1764, one of the Pope&#x27;s nephews, Cardinal Rezzonico, appointed him to start his only architectural work, the restoration of the church of Santa Maria del Priorato in the Villa of the Knights of Malta, on Rome&#x27;s Aventine Hill. He combined Classical architectural elements, trophies and escutcheons with his own particular imaginative genius for the design of the facade of the church and the walls of the adjacent Piazza dei Cavalieri di Malta.

In 1767, he was made a knight of the Golden Spur, which enabled him to sign himself &quot;Cav[aliere] Piranesi&quot;. In 1769, his publication of a series of ingenious and sometimes bizarre designs for chimneypieces, as well as an original range of furniture pieces, established his place as a versatile and resourceful designer. In 1776, he created his best known work as a &#x27;restorer&#x27; of ancient sculpture, the &quot;Piranesi Vase&quot;, and in 1777–78 he published &quot;Avanzi degli Edifici di Pesto&quot; (Remains of the Edifices of Paestum).

He died in Rome in 1778 after a long illness, and was buried in the church he had helped restore, Santa Maria del Priorato. His tomb was designed by Giuseppi Angelini.

==The &quot;Views&quot; (&quot;Vedute&quot;)==

Even though the social structure by an aristocracy remained rigid and oppressive, Venice revived through the Grand Tour as the center of intellectual and international exchange in the eighteenth century. The ideas of the Enlightenment stimulated theorists and artists all over Europe including Paris, Dresden, and London. New forms of artistic expression emerged: veduta, capriccio, and veduta ideata, topographical view, architectural fantasy, accurate renderings of ancient monuments assembled with imaginary compositions in response to the demand of increased visitors.

The developing center of the Grand Tour was Rome. Rome became a new meeting place and intellectual capital of Europe for the leaders of a new movement in the arts. The city was attracting artists and architects from all over Europe beside the Grand Tourists, dealers and antiquarians. While many came through official institutions such as the French Academy, others came to see the new discoveries at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Coffee shops were frequent gathering places, most famously the Antico Caffè Greco, established 1760. The Caffe degli Inglesi opened several years later, at the foot of the Spanish Steps in Piazza di Spagna, with wall paintings by Piranesi. With his own print workshop and museo of antiquities nearby, Piranesi was able to cultivate relationships in both places with wealthy buyers on the tour, particularly English.

The remains of Rome kindled Piranesi&#x27;s enthusiasm. Informed by his experience in Venice and his study of the works of Marco Ricci and particularly Giovanni Paolo Panini, he appreciated not only the engineering of the ancient buildings but also the poetic aspects of the ruins. He was able to faithfully imitate the actual remains; his invention in catching the design of the original architect provided the missing parts. His masterful skill at engraving introduced groups of vases, altars, tombs that were absent in reality; his manipulations of scale; and his broad and scientific distribution of light and shade completed the picture, creating a striking effect from the whole view.

A number of the &quot;Views&quot; are notable for depicting human figures whose poverty, lameness, apparent drunkenness, and other visible flaws appear to echo the decay of the ruins. This is consistent with a familiar trope of Renaissance literature, in which the ruins of Rome are lamented as a metaphor for the imperfection and transience of human existence.

Some of his later work was completed by his children and several pupils. Piranesi&#x27;s son and coadjutor, Francesco, collected and preserved his plates, in which the freer lines of the etching-needle largely supplemented the severity of burin work. Twenty-nine folio volumes containing about 2000 prints appeared in Paris (1835–1837).

The late Baroque works of Claude Lorrain, Salvatore Rosa, and others had featured romantic and fantastic depictions of ruins; in part as a memento mori or as a reminiscence of a golden age of construction. Piranesi also made copies of a number of etchings by Israel Silvestre, whose works he apparently admired. Piranesi&#x27;s reproductions of real and recreated Roman ruins were a strong influence on Neoclassicism.

One of the main features of Neo-Classicism is the attitude towards nature and the uses of the past. Neo-Classicism was prompted by the discoveries at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Rediscovery and revaluation of Greece, Egypt, and Gothic was also active as well as the various expeditions of unfamiliar Roman empire. The view of a Golden Age was changing from static to mutable, inspired by Rousseau and Winckelmann in response to the dynamic growth of society.

The wider perspective on the past created a new way of expression. Artists developed a greater self-consciousness in confronting the limited authority of the ancient world, and there was a growing interest in civilizations and the destiny of nations. Piranesi was especially interested in the Graeco-Roman debate in the 1760s, between followers of Winckelmann who thought Greek culture and architecture superior to their Roman counterparts, and those who (like Piranesi) believed that the Romans had improved upon their Greek models. His free relationship to the past may be summarized in a phrase of his that become a mantra: &quot;col sporcar si trova&quot;; &quot;by messing about, one discovers&quot;.

Throughout his lifetime, Piranesi created numerous prints depicting the Eternal City; these were widely collected by gentlemen on the Grand Tour. The Lobkowicz Collections, housed at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague, contains a group of twenty-six of his engravings.

==The &quot;Prisons&quot; (&quot;Carceri&quot;)==
The &quot;Prisons&quot; (&quot;Carceri d&#x27;invenzione&quot; or &#x27;Imaginary Prisons&#x27;), is a series of 16 prints produced in first and second states that show enormous subterranean vaults with stairs and mighty machines. The series was started in 1745. The first state prints were published in 1750 and consisted of 14 etchings, untitled and unnumbered, with a sketch-like look. The original prints were 16&quot; x 21&quot;. For the second publishing in 1761, all the etchings were reworked and numbered I–XVI (1–16). Numbers II and V were new etchings to the series. Numbers I to IX were all done in portrait format (vertical), while X to XVI were landscape format (horizontal+).

In the second publishing, some of the illustrations appear to have been edited to contain (likely deliberate) impossible geometries.

==Archaeologist==

It is important to look at his contribution as an archaeologist, which was acknowledged at the time as he had been elected to the Society of Antiquaries of London. His influence of technical drawings in antiquarian publications is often overshadowed. He left explanatory notes in the lower margin about the structure and ornament. Most ancient monuments in Rome were abandoned in fields and gardens. Piranesi tried to preserve them with his engravings. To do this, Piranesi pushed himself to achieve realism in his work. A third of the monuments in Piranesi&#x27;s engravings have disappeared, and the stucco and surfacings were often stolen, or restored and modified clumsily. Piranesi&#x27;s precise observational skills allow people to experience the atmosphere in Rome in the eighteenth century. Piranesi may have recognised his role of disseminating remarkable information through meaningful images. He became the Director of the Portici Museum in 1751.

<text>The Africanized bee, also known as the Africanized honey bee (AHB) and colloquially as the &quot;killer bee&quot;, is a hybrid of the western honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;), produced originally by crossbreeding of the East African lowland honey bee (&quot;A. m. scutellata&quot;) with various European honey bee subspecies such as the Italian honey bee (&quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;) and the Iberian honey bee (&quot;A. m. iberiensis&quot;).

The East African lowland honey bee was first introduced to Brazil in 1956 in an effort to increase honey production, but 26 swarms escaped quarantine in 1957. Since then, the hybrid has spread throughout South America and arrived in North America in 1985. Hives were found in south Texas in the United States in 1990.

Africanized honey bees are typically much more defensive, react to disturbances faster, and chase people further () than other varieties of honey bees. They have killed some 1,000 humans, with victims receiving 10 times more stings than from European honey bees. They have also killed horses and other animals.

== History ==
There are 29 recognized subspecies of &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; based largely on geographic variations. All subspecies are cross-fertile. Geographic isolation led to numerous local adaptations. These adaptations include brood cycles synchronized with the bloom period of local flora, forming a winter cluster in colder climates, migratory swarming in Africa, enhanced (long-distance) foraging behavior in desert areas, and numerous other inherited traits.

The Africanized honey bees in the Western Hemisphere are descended from hives operated by biologist Warwick E. Kerr, who had interbred honey bees from Europe and southern Africa. Kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropical conditions than the European strain of honey bee then in use throughout North, Central and South America. The hives containing this particular African subspecies were housed at an apiary near Rio Claro, São Paulo, in the southeast of Brazil, and were noted to be especially defensive. These hives had been fitted with special excluder screens (called queen excluders) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of European bees. According to Kerr, in October 1957 a visiting beekeeper, noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees&#x27; movement, removed them, resulting in the accidental release of 26 Tanganyikan swarms of &quot;A. m. scutellata&quot;. Following this accidental release, the Africanized honey bee swarms spread out and crossbred with local European honey bee colonies.

The descendants of these colonies have since spread throughout the Americas, moving through the Amazon basin in the 1970s, crossing into Central America in 1982, and reaching Mexico in 1985. Because their movement through these regions was rapid and largely unassisted by humans, Africanized honey bees have earned the reputation of being a notorious invasive species. The prospect of killer bees arriving in the United States caused a media sensation in the late 1970s, inspired several horror movies, and sparked debate about the wisdom of humans altering entire ecosystems.

The first Africanized honey bees in the U.S. were discovered in 1985 at an oil field in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Bee experts theorized the colony had not traveled overland but instead &quot;arrived hidden in a load of oil-drilling pipe shipped from South America.&quot; The first permanent colonies arrived in Texas from Mexico in 1990. In the Tucson region of Arizona, a study of trapped swarms in 1994 found that only 15 percent had been Africanized; this number had grown to 90 percent by 1997.

== Characteristics ==
Though Africanized honey bees display certain behavioral traits that make them less than desirable for commercial beekeeping, excessive defensiveness and swarming foremost, they have now become the dominant type of honey bee for beekeeping in Central and South America due to their genetic dominance as well as ability to out-compete their European counterpart, with some beekeepers asserting that they are superior honey producers and pollinators.

Africanized honey bees, as opposed to other Western bee types:
* Tend to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees.
* Are more likely to migrate as part of a seasonal response to lowered food supply.
* Are more likely to &quot;abscond&quot;—the entire colony leaves the hive and relocates—in response to stress.
* Have greater defensiveness when in a resting swarm, compared to other honey bee types.
* Live more often in ground cavities than the European types.
* Guard the hive aggressively, with a larger alarm zone around the hive.
* Have a higher proportion of &quot;guard&quot; bees within the hive.
* Deploy in greater numbers for defense and pursue perceived threats over much longer distances from the hive.
* Cannot survive extended periods of forage deprivation, preventing introduction into areas with harsh winters or extremely dry late summers.
* Live in &quot;dramatically&quot; higher population densities.

== North American distribution ==

Africanized honey bees are considered an invasive species in the Americas. As of 2002, the Africanized honey bees had spread from Brazil south to northern Argentina and north to Central America, Trinidad (the West Indies), Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Florida, and southern California. In June 2005, it was discovered that the bees had spread into southwest Arkansas. Their expansion stopped for a time at eastern Texas, possibly due to the large population of European honey bee hives in the area. However, discoveries of the Africanized honey bees in southern Louisiana show that they have gotten past this barrier, or have come as a swarm aboard a ship.

On 11 September 2007, Commissioner Bob Odom of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry said that Africanized honey bees had established themselves in the New Orleans area. In February 2009, Africanized honey bees were found in southern Utah. The bees had spread into eight counties in Utah, as far north as Grand and Emery Counties by May 2017.

In October 2010, a 73-year-old man was killed by a swarm of Africanized honey bees while clearing brush on his south Georgia property, as determined by Georgia&#x27;s Department of Agriculture. In 2012, Tennessee state officials reported that a colony was found for the first time in a beekeeper&#x27;s colony in Monroe County in the eastern part of the state. In June 2013, 62-year-old Larry Goodwin of Moody, Texas, was killed by a swarm of Africanized honey bees.

In May 2014, Colorado State University confirmed that bees from a swarm which had aggressively attacked an orchardist near Palisade, in west-central Colorado, were from an Africanized honey bee hive. The hive was subsequently destroyed.

In tropical climates they effectively out-compete European honey bees and, at their peak rate of expansion, they spread north at almost two kilometers (about 1¼ mile) a day. There were discussions about slowing the spread by placing large numbers of docile European-strain hives in strategic locations, particularly at the Isthmus of Panama, but various national and international agricultural departments could not prevent the bees&#x27; expansion. Current knowledge of the genetics of these bees suggests that such a strategy, had it been tried, would not have been successful.

As the Africanized honey bee migrates further north, colonies continue to interbreed with European honey bees. In a study conducted in Arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of Africanized honey bees could take over weakened European honey bee hives by invading the hive, then killing the European queen and establishing their own queen. There are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either Africanized honey bees dominate, a mix of Africanized and European honey bees is present, or only non-Africanized honey bees are found, as in the southern portions of South America or northern North America.

African honey bees abscond (abandon the hive and any food store to start over in a new location) more readily than European honeybees. This is not necessarily a severe loss in tropical climates where plants bloom all year, but in more temperate climates it can leave the colony with not enough stores to survive the winter. Thus Africanized honey bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the southern states of the United States, reaching as far north as the Chesapeake Bay in the east. The cold-weather limits of the Africanized honey bee have driven some professional bee breeders from Southern California into the harsher wintering locales of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range. This is a more difficult area to prepare bees for early pollination placement in, such as is required for the production of almonds. The reduced available winter forage in northern California means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup.

The arrival of the Africanized honey bee in Central America is threatening the traditional craft of keeping &quot;Melipona&quot; stingless bees in log gums, although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other. The honey production from an individual hive of Africanized honey bees can be as high as . This value exceeds the much smaller of the various &quot;Melipona&quot; stingless bee species. Thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional stingless bees to the new reality of the Africanized honey bee. Whether this will lead to the extinction of the former is unknown, but they are well adapted to exist in the wild, and there are a number of indigenous plants that the Africanized honey bees do not visit, so the fate of the &quot;Melipona&quot; bees remains to be seen.

== Foraging behavior ==
Africanized honey bees begin foraging at young ages and harvest a greater quantity of pollen compared to their European counterparts (&quot;Apis mellifera ligustica&quot;). This may be linked to the high reproductive rate of the Africanized honey bee, which requires pollen to feed its greater number of larvae. Africanized honey bees are also sensitive to sucrose at lower concentrations. This adaptation causes foragers to harvest resources with low concentrations of sucrose that include water, pollen, and unconcentrated nectar. A study comparing &quot;A. m. scutellata&quot; and &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot; published by Fewell and Bertram in 2002 suggests that the differential evolution of this suite of behaviors is due to the different environmental pressures experienced by African and European subspecies.

=== Proboscis extension responses ===
Honey bee sensitivity to different concentrations of sucrose is determined by a reflex known as the proboscis extension response (PER). Different species of honey bees that employ different foraging behaviors will vary in the concentration of sucrose that elicits their proboscis extension response.

For example, European honey bees (&quot;Apis mellifera ligustica&quot;) forage at older ages and harvest less pollen and more concentrated nectar. The differences in resources collected during harvesting are a result of the European honey bee&#x27;s sensitivity to sucrose at higher concentrations.

=== Evolution ===
The differences in a variety of behaviors between different species of honey bees are the result of a directional selection that acts upon several foraging behavior traits as a common entity. Selection in natural populations of honey bees show that positive selection of sensitivity to low concentrations of sucrose are linked to foraging at younger ages and collecting resources low in sucrose. Positive selection of sensitivity to high concentrations of sucrose were linked to foraging at older ages and collecting resources higher in sucrose. Additionally of interest, &quot;change in one component of a suite of behaviors appear[s] to direct change in the entire suite.&quot;

When resource density is low in Africanized honey bee habitats, it is necessary for the bees to harvest a greater variety of resources because they cannot afford to be selective. Honey bees that are genetically inclined towards resources high in sucrose, such as concentrated nectar, will not be able to sustain themselves in harsher environments. The noted to low sucrose concentration in Africanized honey bees may be a result of selective pressure in times of scarcity when their survival depends on their attraction to low quality resources.

== Morphology and genetics ==
The popular term &quot;killer bee&quot; has only limited scientific meaning today because there is no generally accepted fraction of genetic contribution used to establish a cut-off between a &quot;killer&quot; honey bee and an ordinary honey bee. Government and scientific documents prefer &quot;Africanized honey bee&quot; as an accepted scientific taxon.

===Morphological tests===
Although the native East African lowland honey bees (&quot;Apis mellifera scutellata&quot;) are smaller and build smaller comb cells than the European honey bees, their hybrids are not smaller. Africanized honey bees have slightly shorter wings, which can only be recognized reliably by performing a statistical analysis on micro-measurements of a substantial sample.
One of the problems with this test is that there are other subspecies, such as &quot;A. m. iberiensis&quot;, which also have shortened wings. This trait is hypothesized to derive from ancient hybrid haplotypes thought to have links to evolutionary lineages from Africa. Some belong to &quot;A. m. intermissa&quot;, but others have an indeterminate origin; the Egyptian honeybee (&quot;Apis mellifera lamarckii&quot;), present in small numbers in the southeastern U.S., has the same morphology.

===DNA tests===
Currently testing techniques have moved away from external measurements to DNA analysis, but this means the test can only be done by a sophisticated laboratory. Molecular diagnostics using the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b gene can differentiate &quot;A. m. scutellata&quot; from other &quot;A. mellifera&quot; lineages, though mtDNA only allows one to detect Africanized colonies that have Africanized queens and not colonies where a European queen has mated with Africanized drones. A test based on single nucleotide polymorphisms was created in 2015 to detect Africanized bees based on the proportion of African and European ancestry.

===Western variants===
The western honey bee is native to the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. As of the early 1600s, it was introduced to North America, with subsequent introductions of other European subspecies 200 years later. Since then, they have spread throughout the Americas. The 29 subspecies can be assigned to one of four major branches based on work by Ruttner and subsequently confirmed by analysis of mitochondrial DNA. African subspecies are assigned to branch A, northwestern European subspecies to branch M, southwestern European subspecies to branch C, and Mideast subspecies to branch O. The subspecies are grouped and listed. There are still regions with localized variations that may become identified subspecies in the near future, such as &quot;A. m. pomonella&quot; from the Tian Shan Mountains, which would be included in the Mideast subspecies branch.

The western honey bee is the third insect whose genome has been mapped, and is unusual in having very few transposons. According to the scientists who analyzed its genetic code, the western honey bee originated in Africa and spread to Eurasia in two ancient migrations. They have also discovered that the number of genes in the honey bee related to smell outnumber those for taste. The genome sequence revealed several groups of genes, particularly the genes related to circadian rhythms, were closer to vertebrates than other insects. Genes related to enzymes that control other genes were also vertebrate-like.

===African variants===
There are two lineages of the East African lowland subspecies (&quot;Apis mellifera scutellata&quot;) in the Americas: actual matrilineal descendants of the original escaped queens and a much smaller number that are Africanized through hybridization. The matrilineal descendants carry African mtDNA, but partially European nuclear DNA, while the honey bees that are Africanized through hybridization carry European mtDNA, and partially African nuclear DNA. The matrilineal descendants are in the vast majority. This is supported by DNA analyses performed on the bees as they spread northwards; those that were at the &quot;vanguard&quot; were over 90% African mtDNA, indicating an unbroken matriline, but after several years in residence in an area interbreeding with the local European strains, as in Brazil, the overall representation of African mtDNA drops to some degree. However, these latter hybrid lines (with European mtDNA) do not appear to propagate themselves well or persist. Population genetics analysis of Africanized honey bees in the United States, using a maternally inherited genetic marker, found 12 distinct mitotypes, and the amount of genetic variation observed supports the idea that there have been multiple introductions of AHB into the United States.

A newer publication shows the genetic admixture of the Africanized honey bees in Brazil. The small number of honey bees with African ancestry that were introduced to Brazil in 1956, which dispersed and hybridized with existing managed populations of European origin and quickly spread across much of the Americas, is an example of a massive biological invasion as earlier told in this article. Here, they analysed whole-genome sequences of 32 Africanized honey bees sampled from throughout Brazil to study the effect of this process on genome diversity. By comparison with ancestral populations from Europe and Africa, they infer that these samples had 84% African ancestry, with the remainder from western European populations. However, this proportion varied across the genome and they identified signals of positive selection in regions with high European ancestry proportions. These observations are largely driven by one large gene-rich 1.4 Mbp segment on chromosome 11 where European haplotypes are present at a significantly elevated frequency and likely confer an adaptive advantage in the Africanized honey bee population.

== Consequences of selection ==
The chief difference between the European subspecies of honey bees kept by beekeepers and the African ones is attributable to both selective breeding and natural selection. By selecting only the most gentle, non-defensive subspecies, beekeepers have, over centuries, eliminated the more defensive ones and created a number of subspecies suitable for apiculture.

In Central and southern Africa there was formerly no tradition of beekeeping, and the hive was destroyed in order to harvest the honey, pollen and larvae. The bees adapted to the climate of Sub-Saharan Africa, including prolonged droughts. Having to defend themselves against aggressive insects such as ants and wasps, as well as voracious animals like the honey badger, African honey bees evolved as a subspecies group of highly defensive bees unsuitable by a number of metrics for domestic use.

As Africanized honey bees migrate into regions, hives with an old or absent queen can become hybridized by crossbreeding. The aggressive Africanized drones out-compete European drones for a newly developed queen of such a hive, ultimately resulting in hybridization of the existing colony. Requeening, a term for replacing out the older existing queen with a new, already fertilized one, can avoid hybridization in apiaries. As a prophylactic measure, the majority of beekeepers in North America tend to requeen their hives annually, maintaining strong colonies and avoiding hybridization.

=== Defensiveness ===
Africanized honey bees exhibit far greater defensiveness than European honey bees and are more likely to deal with a perceived threat by attacking in large swarms. These hybrids have been known to pursue a perceived threat for a distance of well over 500 meters (1,640 ft).

The venom of an Africanized honey bee is the same as that of a European honey bee, but since the former tends to sting in far greater numbers, deaths from them are naturally more numerous than from European honey bees. While allergies to the European honey bee may cause death, complications from Africanized honey bee stings are usually not caused from allergies to their venom. Humans stung many times by the Africanized honey bees can exhibit serious side effects such as inflammation of the skin, dizziness, headaches, weakness, edema, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Some cases even progress to affecting different body systems by causing increased heart rates, respiratory distress, and even renal failure. Africanized honey bee sting cases can become very serious, but they remain relatively rare and are often limited to accidental discovery in highly populated areas.

==Impact on humans==
=== Fear factor ===

The Africanized honey bee is widely feared by the public, a reaction that has been amplified by sensationalist movies (such as &quot;The Swarm&quot;) and some of the media reports. Stings from Africanized honey bees kill on average two or three people per year.

As the Africanized honey bee spreads through Florida, a densely populated state, officials worry that public fear may force misguided efforts to combat them:

=== Misconceptions ===
&quot;Killer bee&quot; is a term frequently used in media such as movies that portray aggressive behavior or actively seeking to attack humans. &quot;Africanized honey bee&quot; is considered a more descriptive term in part because their behavior is increased defensiveness compared to European honey bees that can exhibit similar defensive behaviors when disturbed.

The sting of the Africanized honey bee is no more potent than any other variety of honey bee, and although they are similar in appearance to European honey bees, they tend to be slightly smaller and darker in color. Although Africanized honey bees do not actively search for humans to attack, they are more dangerous because they are more easily provoked, quicker to attack in greater numbers, and then pursue the perceived threat farther, for as much as a quarter of a mile (400 metres).

While studies have shown that Africanized honey bees can infiltrate European honey bee colonies and then kill and replace their queen (thus usurping the hive), this is less common than other methods. Wild and managed colonies will sometimes be seen to fight over honey stores during the dearth (periods when plants are not flowering), but this behavior should not be confused with the aforementioned activity. The most common way that a European honey bee hive will become Africanized is through crossbreeding during a new queen&#x27;s mating flight. Studies have consistently shown that Africanized drones are more numerous, stronger and faster than their European cousins and are therefore able to out-compete them during these mating flights. The result of mating between Africanized drones and European queens is almost always Africanized offspring.

== Impact on apiculture ==
In areas of suitable temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized honey bee colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later and work under conditions that often keep European honey bees hive-bound. This is the reason why they have gained a reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. It is also becoming apparent that Africanized honey bees have another advantage over European honey bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues, including parasites such as &quot;Varroa destructor&quot;, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood, and even the mysterious colony collapse disorder which was plaguing beekeepers in the early 2000&#x27;s. Despite all its negative factors, it is possible that the Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.

=== Queen management ===
In areas where Africanized honey bees are well established, bought and pre-fertilized (i.e. mated) European queens can be used to maintain a hive&#x27;s European genetics and behavior. However, this practice can be expensive, since these queens must be bought and shipped from breeder apiaries in areas completely free of Africanized honey bees, such as the northern U.S. states or Hawaii. As such, this is generally not practical for most commercial beekeepers outside the U.S., and it is one of the main reasons why Central and South American beekeepers have had to learn to manage and work with the existing Africanized honey bee. Any effort to crossbreed virgin European queens with Africanized drones will result in the offspring exhibiting Africanized traits; only 26 swarms escaped in 1957, and nearly 60 years later there does not appear to be a noticeable lessening of the typical Africanized characteristics.

=== Gentleness ===

Not all Africanized honey bee hives display the typical hyper-defensive behavior, which may provide bee breeders a point to begin breeding a gentler stock (gAHBs). Work has been done in Brazil towards this end, but in order to maintain these traits, it is necessary to develop a queen breeding and mating facility in order to requeen colonies and to prevent reintroduction of unwanted genes or characteristics through unintended crossbreeding with feral colonies. In Puerto Rico, some bee colonies are already beginning to show more gentle behavior. This is believed to be because the more gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the European honey bee, although they also contain Africanized honey bee material. This degree of aggressiveness is surprisingly almost unrelated to individual genetics – instead being almost entirely determined by the entire hive&#x27;s proportion of aggression genetics.

=== Safety ===
While bee incidents are much less common than they were during the first wave of Africanized honey bee colonization, this can be largely attributed to modified and improved bee management techniques. Prominent among these are locating bee-yards much farther away from human habitation, creating barriers to keep livestock at enough of a distance to prevent interaction, and education of the general public to teach them how to properly react when feral colonies are encountered and what resources to contact. The Africanized honey bee is now considered the honey bee of choice for beekeeping in Brazil.

== Impact on pets and livestock ==

Africanized honey bees are a threat to outdoor pets, especially mammals. The most detailed information available pertains to dogs.

Less is known about livestock as victims. There is a widespread consensus that cattle suffer occasional Africanized honey bee attacks in Brazil, but there is little relevant documentation. It appears that cows sustain hundreds of stings if they are attacked, but can survive such injuries.

<doc id="161812" wikidata="Q569235" url="?curid=161812" title="Saturn Corporation">
<text>The Saturn Corporation, also known as Saturn LLC, was an American automobile manufacturer, a registered trademark established on January 7, 1985, as a subsidiary of General Motors. The company was an attempt by GM to compete directly with Japanese imports and transplants, initially in the US compact car market. The company was known for its &#x27;no-haggle&#x27; sales technique.

Saturn marketed itself as a &quot;different kind of car company&quot; and operated quasi-independently from its parent company,—comprehensively introducing a new car, dealer network, pricing structure, workforce and independently managed manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The first cars themselves launched five years after the company&#x27;s inception, and they advanced GM&#x27;s spaceframe construction—manifesting Saturn&#x27;s market proposition with their dent-resistant polymer exterior panels.

Over time, as Saturn drained resources from GM&#x27;s extensive brand network, the brand would be gradually re-integrated into the GM corporate hierarchy, losing its semi-independent nature and beginning to work on models that increasingly compromised the independence of the brand, first with mild use of shared GM products and platforms in their lineup, but later with a myriad of &quot;parts-bin&quot; cars built mostly or entirely from pre-existing GM equipment rather than independently-engineered material. As GM struggled in the onset of the 2008 economic recession, the parent company further curtailed Saturn&#x27;s development budgets, leaving Saturn to almost fully badge engineer products from other divisions, notably a series of federalized models from Opel. With the gradual shift in internal practices and external outcomes, Saturn lost its unique selling proposition, and the market lost interest. Annual sales achieved their highest level in 1994, with 286,003 vehicles marketed.

Following a failed attempt by Penske Automotive to acquire Saturn from GM in September 2009, Saturn ended production in October 2009, ended outstanding franchises in October 2010, and ceased operations 25 years after it began.

==History==
===1982–1989: Formation===
Alex C. Mair began discussions of a &quot;revolutionary new&quot; small car project, codenamed Saturn, in June 1982, soon after the GM J platform was introduced internationally. In November 1983, the Saturn idea was publicized by General Motors&#x27; Chairman Roger B. Smith and GM&#x27;s President F. James McDonald. Twelve months later, the first Saturn demonstration vehicle was revealed. On January 7, 1985, the Saturn Corporation was officially founded. Citing full disclosure, Saturn was founded as a private, employee-owned company, by former GM leadership. They remained private until GM bought them out, and effectively &quot;rewrote&quot; company history.

In the mid-1980s, GM released the Saturn Concept Car. The car, which resembled the first Saturn SL, was not originally meant to start up a brand; however, GM planned to release the Saturn car under one of its brands, which, at the time, were Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC. In 1985, GM changed their plan and founded Saturn as its own brand, with its first cars being the Saturn SC and Saturn SL. Production of both Saturn vehicles started in 1990 as early 1991 model year vehicles. The Saturn SW was later added for 1993. GM had plans for a sedan, a coupe, a convertible, a wagon, and even a sport utility vehicle; however, Saturn&#x27;s first sport utility vehicle, the Vue, did not appear until the 2002 model year and Saturn&#x27;s first convertible, the Sky, did not appear until the 2006 model year.

===1990–2000: &quot;A new kind of car company&quot;===

On July 30, 1990, the first Saturn was built, a red 1991 model-year Saturn SL2. The first Saturn dealership opened in Memphis, Tennessee. Saturn Corporation was launched as a &quot;different kind of car company&quot;, and Saturn even had its own unique car models (although later models shared platforms with other GM vehicles to be more cost effective in the market), and their own dealership network that was separate from the rest of GM.

Results at Saturn were more doubtful than positive. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the project was too ambitious, as &quot;everything at Saturn is new: the car, the plant, the workforce, the dealer network and the manufacturing process. Not even Toyota, a highly successful and experienced automaker, tackles more than two new items on any single project.&quot; While Saturn cars proved popular and successful in forming emotional connections with buyers, actual sales never met the optimistic projected targets, in part because of the early 1990s recession. It also proved cannibalistic, as 41% of Saturn buyers already owned a GM car. Its separation from the rest of its GM parent, plus the fact that it drained $5 billion from other car projects, stirred discontent within GM&#x27;s other divisions. Also, Saturn opened at considerably higher cost than the Japanese transplants (factories that Japanese automakers established in the United States).

The brand was immediately known for its &quot;no haggle&quot; prices. 
The first Saturn model, the S-Series, was initially quite successful, selling its highest recorded number of annual units in the company&#x27;s history just three years after first starting sales. 
A year later, Saturn entered the Canadian market. In 1993, Saturn&#x27;s 500,000th car, &quot;Carla&quot;, was built. In May 1995, Saturn&#x27;s one millionth car entered the market. In 1996, Saturn dealerships distributed the electric GM EV1, the first electric car released under the GM brand. In 1997, Saturn became the first General Motors North American vehicle to be fully built with right-hand-drive on the same assembly line as the left-hand-drive vehicles (the previous right-hand-drive GM North American vehicles were built in countries with a left-hand road rule using a knock-down kit, customized dashboard, and steering components) as it entered the Japanese market. 
In January 1999, Saturn rolled out its two millionth car. Also in 1999, Saturn began production of its all-new L-Series for the 2000 model year.

By the time the Saturn brand was launched in Japan, the Japanese economy was already in a sharp decline following the 1990 collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble. Resultantly, the surplus was mitigated with the retooling of the right-hand-drive SW models into SWP, or station wagon postal, models, which were then sold to the United States Postal Service.

===2000–2008: Model expansion===

Saturn&#x27;s first compact crossover SUV was introduced in 2001 for the 2002 model year as the Vue based on a globally used GM design. In 2002 for the 2003 model year, Saturn introduced the ION as a replacement for the S-Series. In 2004 for the 2005 model year Saturn began selling the Relay, a minivan and the first Saturn based on similar models from other GM brands. That same year, the L-Series was discontinued. The Sky roadster was introduced in 2006 as a 2007 model. 
In 2006 for the 2007 model year, the Aura midsize sedan made its way to dealerships, alongside the Outlook, a larger CUV than the Vue, and 2006 was the last year that the ION was produced. TheION was replaced by the European-built Astra in 2008. During the 2008 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS), Saturn revealed its Flextreme concept vehicle, which was a rebadged Opel Flextreme.

Saturn was believed to have had a disagreement with GM and was not very accepting of the company closing. In 2004, GM and the United Auto Workers dissolved their unique labor contract for the Spring Hill manufacturing plant, allowing Saturn operations to be integrated with the rest of GM.

===2008–2009: Attempt to sell brand, market changes===
In US Congressional hearings on December 2, 2008, General Motors announced its intentions to focus on their four core brands (Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC), with the sale, consolidation, or closure of Saturn and the remaining brands (Pontiac, Hummer, and Saab, with Oldsmobile having already discontinued production in 2004). General Motors chairman and former CEO Rick Wagoner announced during a news conference on February 17, 2009, that Saturn would remain in operation through the end of the planned life cycle for all Saturn products (2010–2011).

In February 2009, GM declared its intent to part with this brand by closing or selling the division, either to investors or to dealers, as part of restructuring plans dependent upon the receipt of a second round of government loans (&quot;bailout&quot; funding). It was the third such action for GM in the 21st century, following those of Oldsmobile, which ceased production in 2004, and Pontiac, which ended production for the 2010 model year by the end of 2009.

General Motors announced in June 2009 that it was selling the Saturn brand to Penske Automotive Group. The arrangement was similar to the deal under which Penske distributes Daimler AG&#x27;s Smart Car in the United States. Penske was not planning to buy the factories so it would eventually have had to contract other car companies to build cars sold as Saturns. GM would have built the Aura, Vue, and Outlook for Penske for the first two years. To replace GM as the brand&#x27;s manufacturer, Penske was in discussions with several global automakers, including Renault Samsung Motors of Korea, and the Renault-Nissan Alliance.

By the end of 2009, GM closed all of its 46 Saturn dealerships in Canada, even those Saturn dealerships also selling Saab vehicles. GM and Penske decided that they could no longer make a business case to distribute Saturn vehicles in Canada after the sale of the brand. Saturn&#x27;s customer service, parts, and warranty operations moved to other GM dealerships in Canada.

===2009-2010: Failed sale and company end===
On September 30, 2009, Penske ended its deal with General Motors because of Penske not finding another manufacturer to manufacture the Saturn cars. At one point Penske was in talks with car manufacturers including Renault Samsung Motors and the Renault-Nissan Alliance; however, talks with the Renault-Nissan Alliance had ended mainly because of objections from the Nissan part of the alliance. 
Another part of the deal between Penske and GM was for GM to continue making the Aura, the Outlook, and the Vue until 2011, and then another manufacturer would take over. Since Penske did not find another car manufacturer willing to continue production of Saturn vehicles, the deal between Penske and GM ended. As a result, General Motors announced that Saturn Corporation would be ceasing all operations in 2010, and that all Saturn dealerships would be closed by October 31, 2010, or until all of their inventory had been sold.

GM ended Saturn production October 7, 2009 and ended its outstanding franchises on October 31, 2010.

In February 2010, to aid customer retention, GM announced that it was offering existing Saturn owners up to US$2,000 in incentives to purchase a new Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, or GMC vehicle until March 31. Customers were required to have owned their Saturns for at least six months and were not required to trade them in to be eligible for the incentives.

Saturn Authorized Service Providers were introduced since the closing of the Saturn brand, available at GM dealers. Saturn Authorized Service Providers are responsible for all aspects of service, including warranty service, on Saturn vehicles.

Saturn&#x27;s last vehicle models were the Saturn Aura, the Saturn Outlook, the Sky, and the Saturn Vue. GM had continued to produce the Aura, the Outlook, the Sky, and the Vue into the 2010 model year.

In 2012, General Motors rebadged and reintroduced the discontinued Saturn Vue as the 2012 Chevrolet Captiva Sport. The Captiva Sport was mostly unchanged from the discontinued Saturn Vue. The Captiva Sport did not have a hybrid version available, like the Vue did.

==Models==
===Initial models===
Originally, the company&#x27;s products used a dedicated platform called the Z-body and a dedicated engine, the 1.9 L Saturn I4 engine, and a dedicated plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The original Saturns featured dent-resistant plastic body panels which were promoted as easily enabling quick styling revisions, which would happen repeatedly throughout the run of the S-Series, first in 1996 for the SL and SW models, next in 1997 for the SC models, and finally in 2000 across the board.

The Saturn S-Series family of cars were produced from 1991 to 2002 over three generations: First generation cars were produced from 1991 to 1995. For the 1995 model year Saturn used a &quot;first generation&quot; exterior and &quot;second generation&quot; interior. The exterior of the 1995 model looked the same as the first generation cars, but it had larger gauge faces on the instrument cluster and a redesigned center console. First generation engines were rated at for the single overhead cam engines, while the dual overhead cam engines were rated at for the entire run of S-Series cars (1991–2002). In 1996, the second generation S-Series sedan was introduced. Changes carried through until 1999 included a redesigned body and single overhead cam power being increased to . The third generation sedan received only minor design changes for the 2000–2002 production run. The exterior body panels were updated once again, and new paint colors were offered. The sedan retained many of the same mechanical components with an updated interior design. In 1997, the second generation of the sport coupe model was introduced with the front end being changed to accommodate a stationary headlight design, as opposed to the pop-up headlights found on 1990-1992 SC and 1993-1996 SC2 models. The 1999 coupe models received a suicide door behind the driver side door. The S-Series was produced in three variations: coupe (SC), sedan (SL), and wagon (SW). The wagon was introduced for the 1993 model year and it was produced until 2001. The SW model had a relatively obscure run as a USPS vehicle, which resulted from GM&#x27;s failed plan to attack the Japanese market directly with right-hand-drive Saturn S-Series vehicles. Upon its failure in the Japanese market, Saturn sold off its surplus of RHD wagons in an attempt to &quot;compete in the very narrow niche of providing right-hand drive vehicles to rural route carriers&quot;.

There was, even in the early stages of the company&#x27;s production, work on a concept car. As mentioned in the Saturn Owner&#x27;s Manuals from 1993 and occasionally in publications featuring Saturn executives, an SL3 was in the works. It was said to be aesthetically similar to an SL2, however it would sport the front bumper and retractable headlamps featured on the SC2 models. It was to be powered by a 2.5L inline 6 with five valves per cylinder, which would reportedly output roughly 250 horsepower (186 kW; 254 PS).

=== Intermediate Models ===
The first significant change in Saturn&#x27;s lineup came with the 2000 Saturn L-Series mid-size car. It shared the GM2900 platform with the Opel Vectra, along with its engine. It was built at a GM factory in Wilmington, Delaware. The 2000 model year cars were designated LS-1 (4 cylinder) and LS-2 (6 cylinder.) Since Lincoln-Mercury owned the LS designator, and to prevent a lawsuit, Saturn changed the designators to L200 and L300 for the model years 2001–2005. The Saturn L200 was discontinued after the 2003 model year. This shift in production marked a significant change to Saturn&#x27;s treatment as a pseudo-independent company from General Motors, which would only intensify with time.

Saturn introduced its long-awaited SUV model in 2002 with the release of the first generation Saturn Vue. The design featured a 5-door spaceframe layout with the plastic body panels long-familiar to the brand. The Vue released with, similarly to the L-Series, an Ecotec I4 (L61) and V6 (L81). In an unorthodox move for the traditionally American-branded, Japanese-competitive brand, the Vue shed the L81 V6 option in 2004, instead opting for a Honda J35S1 V6. The I4 also could be coupled with GM&#x27;s first passenger car CVT, albeit for only three years, as by 2005 the CVT option had been discontinued due to poor dependability. Both front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive were available, though for the first year and a half of sales, the V6 option was AWD exclusively. 2004 brought about the Red Line model, as well, which featured the same Honda V6 in addition to an AWD powertrain, lower suspension, larger wheels, different body cosmetics, and an overall more luxurious interior. In late 2006, the Vue Green Line was released as a mild hybrid model, featuring a 2.4L Ecotec I4 (LE5), however now also with an electric motor&#x27;s assistance. The Vue would be carried over into a second generation following 2007, even retaining its model trim levels, but it would not retain the definite Saturn-brand elements of the first generation. It would go on to lose its spaceframe construction and plastic body paneling in favor of the cues of the Opel Antara, that being the model it was badge-engineered from.

In 2003, the Saturn ION replaced the S-Series compact, marking the end of Saturn&#x27;s fully-original car designs. The Vue was left as the most original Saturn production, albeit even that used both global GM and Honda engines rather than in-house designs. Production of the Saturn ION was temporarily stopped for three weeks in 2003 due to Saturn dealerships having an overstock of ION vehicles.

The Saturn L-Series was discontinued after the 2005 model year due to poor sales, one year after Oldsmobile had been discontinued.

===Final model line===

In 2007, the two final Saturn models with plastic body panels were the Vue and ION. Plastic body panels were discontinued on all Saturn models after the 2007 model year. None of the 2008 Saturn models used plastic body panels.

The 2009 Saturn models were the Sky roadster, the Aura sedan, the Astra hatchback, the second generation Vue compact crossover SUV, and the Outlook full-size crossover SUV built off the GM Lambda platform.

Some of the final Saturns were virtually identical to certain European Opel/Vauxhall models. For example, the 2008 Saturn Vue was a rebadged Opel Antara, while the Opel GT was based on the Saturn Sky Red Line. The Saturn Astra was a rebadged version of the Opel Astra. The Saturn Astra was also the first Saturn to be built outside of North America. The Saturn Astra was built in Antwerp, Belgium. 
Saturn&#x27;s version of the Astra was available as a captive import from late 2007 until Saturn was discontinued following GM&#x27;s 2010 bankruptcy.

Saturn had featured two sub-lines of their vehicles: the Green Line and the Red Line. The Green Line Saturn models were environmentally-friendly, more economical mild hybrid vehicles, and the Red Line Saturn models were high-performance and driver-oriented vehicles.

=== Red Line Models ===

The Red Line trim vehicles were built from the same architecture as existing models, but with an emphasis heightened performance. Three models were given Red Line variants, those being (in chronological order) the Saturn ION Red Line, The Saturn Vue Red Line, and the Saturn Sky Red Line. The ION and Sky&#x27;s Red Line trims were badge-engineered variants on other GM divisions&#x27; higher-tier performance vehicles, those being the ION Red Line&#x27;s sister car of the Chevrolet Cobalt SS Supercharged and the Sky Red Line&#x27;s sister car of the Pontiac Solstice GXP (although the targa hardtop variant would not make it to the Sky). The Vue Red Line, however, was an original Saturn vehicle until 2008, where it was then launched in a second generation as a badge-engineered Opel Antara.

Both the ION and Sky Red Line trims used 2.0L Ecotec family powertrains. The ION Red Line and Sky Red Line featured forced-induction Ecotec I4 motors. The ION Red Line utilized a 2.0L LSJ engine equipped with an Eaton M62 roots-type supercharger. The Sky Red Line featured the 2.0L LNF engine equipped with a twin-scroll turbocharger. On the other hand, the Vue Red Line featured first a naturally aspirated 3.5L Honda J35A3 V6 from the years 2004 to 2007. After 2007, the Vue was given a second generation, which featured GM&#x27;s 3.6L naturally aspirated LY7 V6 also used in the Vue XR. This change in engine also came with an additional 7 horsepower (6 kW; 8PS) and 6 lb⋅ft (8 N⋅m) from the first generation Red Line models.

=== Green Line Models ===

Green Line trims, like Red Line trims, were models based upon pre-existing vehicles, however this iteration favored a focus on fuel economy. Two vehicles in the Saturn roster received Green Line variants, those being the Saturn Aura and the Saturn Vue. The Vue was initially given a 2007 Green Line variant during its first generation, making it Saturn&#x27;s only original hybrid vehicle. This would be done away with the following year, as the second generation Saturn Vue came out with a Green Line trim. The Saturn Aura would, shortly after its debut in 2007, offer a Green Line package in March.

Results of the Green Line models were not exceedingly remarkable, although it was advertised that the Vue Green Line could have up to a &quot;20-percent improvement in fuel economy, depending on driving conditions&quot;. The Aura Green Line gained similar, albeit somewhat enthusiastic reception, as it would be noted to have fuel economy that was &quot;15-20% better than the typical 4-cylinder mid-size sedan&quot; but with significant deficiencies to some of the Japanese hybrid competition of its day.

<text>The Chatuchak Weekend Market (, ), on Kamphaeng Phet 2 Road, Chatuchak, Bangkok, is the largest market in Thailand. Also known as JJ Market, it has more than 15,000 stalls and 11,505 vendors (2019), divided into 27 sections. Chatuchak Market sells many different kinds of goods, including plants, antiques, consumer electronics, cosmetics, pets, fresh and dry food and drinks, ceramics, furniture and home accessories, clothing, and books.

It is the world&#x27;s largest and most diverse weekend market, with over 200,000 visitors every weekend.

==History==
Chatuchak Market has been open since 1942. In 1948, Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram had a policy that every province was required to have its own market. Bangkok chose Sanam Luang as the market site. After a few months, the government moved the market to Sanam Chai. The market moved back to Sanam Luang in 1958. 

Starting in 1975, General Kriangsak Chamanan had the policy of using Sanam Luang as a place of recreational activity for the populace which would also be used for commemorating ceremony. As General Kriangsak Chamanan was the chairman of State Railway of Thailand at that time, he thus permitted the use of land on the south side of Chatuchak Park as a market. His plan was to recycle waste from the looming Din Daeng Garbage Mountain which had stacked up across the decades to use as landfills, and he recruited military engineers for the job. The park was fully completed in 1978, when General Kriangsak Chomanan became the Prime Minister. 

By 1983, all of the merchants had moved to Chatuchak. At that time the market was called Phahonyothin Market. In 1987, its name was changed to Chatuchak Market.

The clock tower is a distinctive landmark in the Chatuchuk Market. It was built in 1987 on the occasion of King Bhumibol Adulyadej&#x27;s 60th birthday on 5 December 1987, a cooperative effort of the market administration and Thai-Chinese Merchant Association.

On Tuesday 11 June 2024, at about 4am, a fire broke out in the ornamental fish zone in Srisomrat Market, also affectionately known as Sunday Market, adjacent to the bigger Chatuchak market, burning out 118 sales stalls, killing some 1,000 animals including snakes, spiders and Siamese fighting fish.

==Economics==
Monthly stall rent for vendors at the market ranges from 10,600 to 17,700 baht. A University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC) study found that most merchants have been selling at the weekend market for four to six years and have an average sales revenue of 139,500 baht per month.

==Trade in illegal wildlife==
Studies have shown that the Chatuchak Market is a centre for trade in illegal wildlife.

In a survey conducted on 28–29 March 2015, researchers counted 1,271 birds of 117 species for sale in 45 shops or stalls. Of the total, nine species were listed as &quot;Threatened&quot; on the IUCN Red List and eight species as &quot;Near Threatened&quot;.

<text>Donald Edward Keyhoe (June 20, 1897 – November 29, 1988) was an American Marine Corps naval aviator, writer of aviation articles and stories in a variety of publications, and tour manager of aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh.

In the 1950s, Keyhoe became a UFO researcher and writer, arguing that the U.S. government should conduct research into UFO matters, and should publicly release all its UFO files. A biography by Linda Powell—&quot;Against the Odds: Major Donald E. Keyhoe and His Battle to End UFO Secrecy&quot;—was published in 2023.

==Early life and career==
Keyhoe was born and raised in Ottumwa, Iowa. Upon receiving his B.S. degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1919, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps.

In 1922, his arm was injured during an airplane crash in Guam. During his long convalescence, Keyhoe began writing as a hobby. He eventually returned to active duty, but the injury gave Keyhoe persistent trouble, and, as a result, he resigned from the Marines in 1923. He then worked for the National Geodetic Survey and U.S. Department of Commerce.

In 1927, Keyhoe managed a coast-to-coast tour by Charles Lindbergh. This led to Keyhoe&#x27;s first book, 1928&#x27;s &quot;Flying With Lindbergh&quot;. The book was a success, and led to a freelance writing career, with Keyhoe&#x27;s articles and fictional stories (mostly related to aviation) appearing in a variety of publications.

Keyhoe returned to active duty during World War II in a Naval Aviation Training Division before retiring again at the rank of major.

== Writing for the pulps and glossies ==
By the time his UFO books appeared, Keyhoe was already an established author, with stories in the pulp magazines of the 1920s and 1930s. Four of his short stories were printed in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;: &quot;The Grim Passenger&quot; (1925), &quot;The Mystery Under the Sea&quot; (1926), &quot;Through the Vortex&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Master of Doom&quot; (1927). He also produced the lead novel for all three issues of a short-lived magazine &quot;Dr. Yen Sin&quot;: &quot;The Mystery of the Dragon&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (May–June 1936), &quot;The Mystery of the Golden Skull&quot; (July–August 1936) and &quot;The Mystery of the Singing Mummies&quot; (September–October 1936). The Doctor was opposed by a hero who could not sleep.

Keyhoe wrote a number of air adventure stories for &quot;Flying Aces&quot;, and other magazines, and created two larger-than-life superheroes in this genre. The first of these was Captain Philip Strange, referred to as &quot;the Brain Devil&quot; and &quot;the Phantom Ace of G-2.&quot; Captain Strange was an American intelligence officer during World War I who was gifted with ESP and other mental powers. His existence has been perpetuated beyond Keyhoe&#x27;s stories as a minor member of the Wold Newton universe.

Keyhoe&#x27;s other &quot;superpowered&quot; flying ace was Richard Knight, a World War I veteran who was blinded in combat but gained a supernatural ability to see in the dark. Knight featured in 35 adventure stories from 1936 to 1942.

Other series he wrote included the &quot;Eric Trent&quot; series in &quot;Flying Aces&quot; and the &quot;Vanished Legion&quot; in &quot;Dare-Devil Aces&quot;, and two long-running series: &quot;The Devildog Squadron&quot; in &quot;Sky Birds&quot; and &quot;The Jailbird Flight&quot; in &quot;Battle Aces&quot;.

Many of Keyhoe&#x27;s stories for the pulps were science fiction or Weird Fantasy, or contained a significant measure of these elements — a fact that was not lost on later critics of his UFO books.

He was also a freelancer for &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

==&quot;The Flying Saucers Are Real&quot;==
Interest in UFOs broke out across the United States following pilot Kenneth Arnold&#x27;s report of odd, fast-moving aerial objects in Washington State during the summer of 1947. Keyhoe began to follow the subject with some interest, though he was initially skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the UFO question. For some time, &quot;True&quot; (a popular American men&#x27;s magazine) had been inquiring of officials as to the flying saucer question, with little to show for their efforts. In the spring of 1949, after the U.S. Air Force had released contradictory information about the saucers, editor Ken Purdy turned to Keyhoe, who had written for the magazine, but who also had friends and contacts in the military and the Pentagon.

As their forms, flight maneuvers, speeds and light technology was apparently far ahead of any nation&#x27;s developments, Keyhoe became convinced that they must be the products of unearthly intelligences, and that the U.S. government was trying to suppress the whole truth about the subject. This conclusion was based especially on the response Keyhoe found when he quizzed various officials about flying saucers. He was told there was nothing to the subject, yet was simultaneously denied access to saucer-related documents. One way in which Keyhoe took it upon himself to quiz these officials was to send letters to an Executive Officer by the name of J. S. Earman. 3 letters can be found on the CIA&#x27;s official website in which Keyhoe inquires towards the CIA&#x27;s knowledge of UFOs. Earman&#x27;s answers appear to be unsatisfactory for Major Keyhoe but at some point after this he came to the conclusion that would lead him to write &quot;The Flying Saucers Are Real&quot;. It is worth mentioning that, like many declassified CIA documents, these letters have been largely marked up in post.

Keyhoe&#x27;s article &quot;Flying Saucers Are Real&quot; appeared in the January 1950 issue of &quot;True&quot; (published December 26, 1949) and caused a sensation. Though such figures are always difficult to verify, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of Project Blue Book, reported that &quot;It is rumored among magazine publishers that Don Keyhoe&#x27;s article in &quot;True&quot; was one of the most widely read and widely discussed magazine articles in history.&quot;

Capitalizing on the interest, Keyhoe expanded the article into a book, &quot;The Flying Saucers Are Real&quot; (1950); it sold over half a million copies in paperback. He argued that the Air Force knew that flying saucers were extraterrestrial, but downplayed the reports to avoid public panic. In Keyhoe&#x27;s view, the aliens — wherever their origins or intentions — did not seem hostile, and had likely been surveilling the Earth for two hundred years or more, though Keyhoe wrote that their &quot;observation suddenly increased in 1947, following the series of A-bomb explosions in 1945.&quot; Michael D. Swords characterized the book as &quot;a rather sensational but accurate account of the matter.&quot; (Swords, p. 100) Boucher and McComas praised it as &quot;cogent, intelligent and persuasive.&quot;

Keyhoe wrote several more books about UFOs. &quot;Flying Saucers from Outer Space&quot; (Holt, 1953) was largely based on interviews and official reports vetted by the Air Force. The book included a blurb by Albert M. Chop, the Air Force&#x27;s press secretary in the Pentagon, who characterized Keyhoe as a &quot;responsible, accurate reporter&quot; and further expressed approval for Keyhoe&#x27;s arguments in favor of the extraterrestrial hypothesis.

Carl Jung argued that Keyhoe&#x27;s first two books were &quot;based on official material and studiously avoid the wild speculations, &quot;naivete&quot; or prejudice of other [UFO] publications.&quot;

===&quot;The Flying Saucer Conspiracy&quot;===
In 1955, Keyhoe authored &quot;The Flying Saucer Conspiracy&quot;, which pointedly accused elements of United States government of engaging in a conspiracy to cover up knowledge of flying saucers. Keyhoe claims the existence of a &quot;silence group&quot; of orchestrating this conspiracy. Historian of folklore Curtis Peebles argues: &quot;&quot;The Flying Saucer Conspiracy&quot; marked a shift in Keyhoe&#x27;s belief system. No longer were flying saucers the central theme; that now belonged to the silence group and its coverup. For the next two decades Keyhoe&#x27;s beliefs about this would dominate the flying saucer myth.&quot;

The book features claims of a possible discovery of an &quot;orbiting space base&quot; or a &quot;Moon base&quot;, knowledge of which might trigger a public panic. &quot;The Flying Saucer Conspiracy&quot; also incorporated legends of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances. Keyhoe sensationalized claims, ultimately stemming from optical illusions, of unusual structures on the moon.

==The NICAP era==
In 1956, Keyhoe cofounded the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). He was one of several prominent professional, military or scientific figures on the board of directors, which lent the group a degree of legitimacy many of the other contemporary &quot;flying saucer clubs&quot; sorely lacked. NICAP published a newsletter, &quot;The UFO Investigator&quot;, which was mailed to its members. Although the newsletter was intended to be published on a regular monthly basis, due to financial problems it was often delivered on a more erratic basis. For example, in 1958 four issues were published, but only two issues were published in 1959.

NICAP founder Thomas Townsend Brown was ousted as director in early 1957 after facing repeated charges of financial ineptitude. Keyhoe replaced him; he was only slightly better at managing NICAP&#x27;s finances, and the organization often faced financial shortfalls and crises throughout Keyhoe&#x27;s twelve years as director. Even so, it would remain the largest and most influential civilian UFO research group in the United States from the late 1950s to the late 1960s.

With Keyhoe in the lead, NICAP pressed hard for Congressional hearings and investigation into UFOs. They scored some attention from the mass media, and the general public (NICAP&#x27;s membership peaked at about 15,000 during the early and mid-1960s) but only very limited interest from government officials.

However, there was increasing criticism of the Air Force&#x27;s Project Blue Book. Following a widely publicized wave of UFO reports in 1966, NICAP was among the chorus which called for an independent scientific investigation of UFOs. The Condon Committee was formed at the University of Colorado with this goal in mind, though it quickly became mired in infighting and later, in controversy. Keyhoe publicized the so-called &quot;Trick Memo&quot;, an embarrassing memorandum written by the Condon Committee coordinator which seemed to suggest that the ostensibly objective and neutral committee had determined to pursue a debunking operation well before even beginning their studies.

==Television appearances==
On January 22, 1958, Keyhoe appeared on a CBS live television show the &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot; to speak on the topic of UFOs. Keyhoe charged that a U.S. Congressional committee was evaluating evidence that &quot;will absolutely prove that the UFOs are machines under intelligent control&quot;. However CBS stopped the audio portion of the live broadcast. Herbert A. Carlborg, CBS director of editing stated &quot;this program had been carefully cleared for security reasons&quot;.

On March 8, 1958, Keyhoe appeared on &quot;The Mike Wallace Interview&quot; on ABC and spoke about flying saucers, contactees and the details of the &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot; censorship, which he blamed on the Air Force rather than CBS.

In 1967, Keyhoe appeared as himself on the May 23 episode of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, receiving three of four possible votes.

Keyhoe was portrayed by actor Adam Greydon Reid in an episode of the television series &quot;Project Blue Book&quot;. In the episode, &quot;The Lubbock Lights&quot; (aired January 22, 2019), Keyhoe is a writer (spelled in the IMDB credits as &quot;Donald Kehoe&quot;) who federal agents try to intimidate into clearing his UFO stories through them before publication.

==Later life==
NICAP&#x27;s membership plummeted in the late 1960s, and Keyhoe was blamed by critics within NICAP for the organization&#x27;s decline. Some NICAP members accused him of incompetent handling of NICAP&#x27;s finances and personnel, and of being too authoritarian in his leadership style. By July 1969 NICAP was facing bankruptcy, and Keyhoe was forced to lay off five of NICAP&#x27;s nine staff members. Additionally, &quot;The UFO Investigator&quot;, the organization&#x27;s newsletter, which was edited and published by Keyhoe, gradually moved from being delivered on a reliable monthly basis in the mid-1960s to an increasingly erratic and unreliable delivery schedule, which angered many NICAP subscribers. In 1969 Keyhoe turned his focus away from the military and focused on the CIA as the source of the UFO cover up. However, NICAP&#x27;s Board of Governors, headed by Colonel Joseph Bryan III, investigated NICAP&#x27;s finances and found that Social Security taxes had been withheld from employee&#x27;s paychecks, but not reported to the government, and that some NICAP members had not paid their annual dues for years, but were still receiving copies of &quot;The UFO Investigator&quot; and enjoying full NICAP membership rights. In December 1969, in what was described as a &quot;stormy meeting&quot;, the board forced Keyhoe to retire as NICAP chief. Colonel Bryan became the new director of NICAP. Under Bryan&#x27;s leadership, NICAP disbanded its local and state affiliate groups, and by 1973 it had been completely closed.

In 1973, Keyhoe wrote his final book about UFOs, &quot;Aliens from Space&quot;. It promoted &quot;Operation Lure&quot;, a plan to entice extraterrestrials to land on Earth, and described the problems Keyhoe had getting information from government agents.

Beyond this book, Keyhoe had little contact with ufology as he settled into retirement. However, he did speak at several UFO conferences after his ouster from NICAP. In 1981 he joined MUFON&#x27;s board of directors, but his membership was essentially in name only because of his declining health, and he had little to do with the organization. Donald Keyhoe died in 1988 at the age of 91.

Several of Keyhoe&#x27;s books are now in the public domain and are available online.

<text>Ludichrist is an American band formed in 1984 in Long Island, New York. Their musical style broke from the conventions of New York hardcore by adding aspects of rock, heavy metal and jazz, such as and extended guitar solos. Ludichrist is one of the crossover movement&#x27;s most prominent groups, alongside D.R.I. Drummer Dave Miranda saw Ludichrist as &quot;crossing into both, punk and metal without firmly belonging into either camp.&quot; He observed that &quot;the band was readily influenced by bands around them such as Crumbsuckers and Agnostic Front.&quot;

==History==
===Early history and recordings===
Ludichrist was founded in 1984 by Al Batross (aka Al Bazin) and Mark Durnex (aka Mark Kanabrocki) in Long Island, New York. The first line-up included
Batross on drums, Durnex on guitar, Chud on vocals, and Chuck Valle on bass. Batross, the group&#x27;s first wordsmith named the group and wrote the lyrics for the core group of songs the band played. Durnex wrote the songs. After a few months Tommy Franco (aka Tommy Christ) replaced Chud as vocalist, and the group produced a demo cassette tape titled &quot;Ludichrist&quot; and leveraged it to book performances at regional venues that allowed punk shows.

Guitarist Glen Cummings joined the group as lead guitarist, and after a few rehearsals the group decided to re-record its demo tape to highlight its new, denser sound. The group recorded &quot;Ludichrist, The Demo&quot;, and released it on cassette. The cassette features a graphic &quot;cover&quot; and a 16-page illustrated booklet designed by Christ and Cummings. The group purchased a half-page space in Maximum Rock n Roll fanzine to advertise the cassette.

===CBGBs Records===
The group performed mainly in NYC where there were existing venues and a hardcore scene, but the group first substantial following grew out of a series of shows at Club Anthrax in Connecticut, enabling the group to larger crowds around the east coast region. After a series of energized performances at his venue, CBGBs owner Hilly Kristal asked the group to release a live recording of their show on CBGBs record label which he was reviving through a series of cassette-only releases. Instead of releasing the live performance made on the venues mixing console earlier that day the group waited until the venue was closed then performed a more precise version of its set to only the engineer, Steve. This live recording was expertly combined with crowd sounds from the earlier matinee and released as &quot;CBGBs Live &quot;Off the Board&quot; Ludichrist&quot;.

Founding member, Mark Durnex (aka Mark Kanabrocki) who had written most of the first album&#x27;s songs appears only on the two demos and the CBGBs cassette – leaving the group before Immaculate Deception was recorded. Long Island native and ludichrist fan Joe Butcher joined the group as second guitarist, bringing his active musical sensibilities with him. Joe wrote the music for the album track &quot;Thinking of You&quot; - lyrics by Tommy Christ.

Per an interview with Cummings that was posted on Facebook in Nov. 2024 by Blasted By Britton, a reissue of the CBGBs cassette is being discussed with Megaforce Records.

===Immaculate Deception===

&quot;Immaculate Deception&quot; features the line-up: Batross, Butcher, Christ, Cummings, and Valle – and was recorded at Platinum Island Sounds in Manhattan with Randy Burns producing. 
The album track &quot;You Can&#x27;t Have Fun&quot; features guest vocalists Roger Miret, John Connelly, Chris Notaro, and Eddie Sutton from fellow New York bands Agnostic Front, Nuclear Assault, Crumbsuckers and Leeway. Drummer and founder Al Batross left the group after Immaculate Deception was recorded.
===Powertrip===
By the time their second album, &quot;Powertrip&quot;, was released, only two original members, singer Tommy and guitarist Glen, were left. The band became far more metallic in style, while retaining a range of musical influences and being more overtly humorous, they abandoned the early hardcore style and featured musicianship by Paul Neider (guitar) and Dave Miranda (drums) in particular. After the American tour bassist Mike Walter departed and Guy Bronga joined the group. After the European tour drummer Dave Miranda departed and Mike Boyko joined the group. 

Before the release of Ludichrist&#x27; third album &quot;Here Comes Trouble&quot; on In Effect Records, the group renamed itself Scatterbrain, to circumvent a boycott by conservative Christian record distributors.

In a Nov. 2024 interview with Blasted By Britton, Cummings shared that a three-song demo for &quot;Powertrip&quot;, known as both &quot;The Basement Demos&quot; and &quot;And We Mean That&quot;, will be issued in the future by F.O.A.D. Records.

===Post-Ludichrist===

Al Batross (Al Bazin) formed Big Sniff (with releases on both Mint Tone Records and Do iT! Records in Germany) with future members of The Arsons and Kill Your Idols in the 1990s. From 2001 through 2003 Batros played with MDC (Millions of Dead Cops). , Batross continues to live in NYC and has been the sole American member in three all-Japanese bands: The Plungers, The Spunks and Gelatine. Bazin is also a film and video editor.

Original bassist Chuck Valle joined Murphy&#x27;s Law, and had become an audio engineer (see Six and Violence), but was stabbed to death in California.

<doc id="161824" wikidata="Q1266300" url="?curid=161824" title="Neue Slowenische Kunst">
<text>Neue Slowenische Kunst (; NSK; ) is a political art collective that formed in Slovenia in 1984, when the Socialist Republic of Slovenia was part of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. NSK&#x27;s name was chosen to reflect the theme in its works of the complicated relationship Slovenes have had with Germans. The name of NSK&#x27;s music wing, Laibach, is also the German name of the Slovene capital Ljubljana. The name created controversy because some felt it evoked memories of the Nazi annexation of Slovenia during the Second World War. It also refers to Slovenia&#x27;s previous seven centuries as part of the Habsburg monarchy.

==Composition==

NSK was founded by the musical group Laibach. Other NSK members include groups such as IRWIN (visual art), Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre (also known as Red Pilot and Cosmokinetic Theatre Noordung), New Collective Studio (graphics; also known as New Collectivism), Retrovision (film and video), and the Department of Pure and Applied Philosophy (theory). The founding groups of the NSK were Laibach, IRWIN, and Scipion Nasice Sisters Theater. Membership has traditionally been open to all artistic groups who show an interest in challenging the norms and taboos of Slovene national identity.

==Characteristics==
NSK art often draws on symbols from totalitarian or extreme nationalist movements, often appropriating totalitarian kitsch in a visual style reminiscent of Dada. NSK artists often juxtapose symbols from different (and often incompatible) political ideologies. For example, a 1987 NSK-designed poster caused a scandal by winning a competition for the Yugoslavian Youth Day Celebration. The poster appropriated a painting by Nazi artist Richard Klein, replacing the flag of Nazi Germany with the Yugoslav flag and the German eagle with a dove. Intended as an ironic joke, the painting soon fell foul of the authorities, who interpreted it as equating Marshal Josip Broz Tito with Adolf Hitler. It was later reproduced on the cover of &quot;Mladina&quot; magazine, and that particular issue was subsequently banned.

The NSK was the subject of a 1996 documentary film entitled &quot;Predictions of Fire&quot; (&quot;Prerokbe Ognja&quot;), which was written and directed by Michael Benson. Among those interviewed is Slovenian intellectual Slavoj Žižek.

==NSK State==
Since 1991, the NSK has claimed to be a sovereign state of sorts. As such, displays of its members&#x27; work are performed under the guise of an embassy, or a territory of the supposed state. Since 1994, the NSK has maintained consulates in several cities, including Umag, Croatia. It has also issued passports and postage stamps. 
NSK passports are considered an art project. As such, they are not valid for travel. Laibach&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Volk&quot;, which consisted of songs based on national albums, included a national anthem of NSK, an arrangement of the Laibach song &quot;The Great Seal&quot;.
In 2010, the first NSK Citizens Congress was held in Berlin. It was followed by a &quot;NSK Rendez-Vous&quot; in Lyon, France, where Alexei Monroe revealed NSK&#x27;s aim : to make people &quot;aware that totalitarianism isn&#x27;t a discrete historical phenomenon which went on from 1933 to 1989 and then it&#x27;s over so let&#x27;s have a nice triumph of liberal democracy&quot;. On 26 February 2011, another &quot;NSK Rendez-Vous&quot; took place in London. In 2012, yet another &quot;NSK Rendez-Vous&quot; was set to take place in New York City&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art.
2017 saw NSK set up a pavilion at the Venice Biennale where Slavoj Žižek stated that &quot;the uniqueness of NSK is this idea of the &#x27;stateless state&#x27;.

<text>Chedworth is a village and civil parish in Gloucestershire, southwest England, in the Cotswolds. It is known as the location of Chedworth Roman Villa, administered since 1924 by the National Trust.

Chedworth Stream rises close to the village and flows east for about in a narrow valley before joining the River Coln at the point where it is crossed by the ancient Fosse Way.

==Roman villa==
The villa is a 1,700-year-old farmstead between Yanworth and Withington, about 3 miles (5.5 km) from Chedworth village by road, although it sits to the south of the River Coln and so is within Chedworth parish. It is connected with Chedworth village by two long-distance footpaths, the Macmillan Way and the Monarch&#x27;s Way, both about 1 mile in walking distance. The villa was discovered by chance in 1864. It is the remains of one of the largest Romano-British villas in England, featuring several mosaics, two bathhouses, hypocausts (underfloor heating), a water-shrine and a latrine. The water shrine became very special as the Romans used it to worship the goddess of the natural spring that gives it an endless amount of water. New visitor facilities opened in 2014.

==History==
The parish church of St Andrew is of 12th century Norman origin, but was much rebuilt in the second half of the 15th century. The south doorway has been described as &quot;a most notable piece of rich Perpendicular work&quot; and the south range of five Perpendicular windows has also been admired: &quot;The interior is very charming because these great Perpendicular windows are like a wall of clear tinted glass which reflects the light onto the plastered walls.&quot;

The medieval judge and cleric Thomas de Chaddesworth, or de Chedworth, Dean of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, and an unsuccessful candidate to be Archbishop of Dublin, was born here in about 1230, and took his surname from the village. He died in Ireland in 1311.

Between 1892 and 1961, the village had a railway station on the Midland and South Western Junction Railway.

In 1930, Rose Cottage in Chedworth was bought by Henry Ford, who paid for it to be dismantled and transported to Greenwich Village in Dearborn, Michigan, United States.

Until the 2015 district council elections, there was an electoral ward in the same name. This ward started in the south at Chedworth and stretched north to end at Dowdeswell. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 1,705.

Chedworth Parish Council was formed under the Local Government Act of 1894. Its first preliminary meeting was held on 4 December 1894, and the first full meeting on 3 January 1895, chaired by the Rev. Sackett Hope. Fifteen candidates stood for election to the seven seats available. Subsequently, in 1904 again 15 candidates stood for the seven seats, and none of the previous incumbents was re-elected. The Parish Council still has seven members, with the last election in 2023. The council holds monthly meetings on the second Monday of each month at the Village Hall.

==Amenities==
The Seven Tuns Inn is close to the church at the far western, &quot;upper&quot; end of the village. The &quot;tuns&quot; are variously chimneys or barrels, both of which have featured on the pub sign at different times. It is a Grade II listed building. Chedworth had a post office and village store for over 120 years before the final postmistress, Miss Lait, closed her Fields Road establishment in 1993, leaving Chedworth with no retail outlets. Following a vigorous campaign by local residents, Chedworth Farm Shop opened in 2006, using former dairy buildings at Denfurlong Farm on Fields Road. However, the farm shop closed permanently on 27 February 2021.

<doc id="161828" wikidata="Q1009261" url="?curid=161828" title="Caerleon">
<text>Caerleon ( ; ) is a town and community in Newport, Wales. Situated on the River Usk, it lies northeast of Newport city centre, and southeast of Cwmbran. Caerleon is of archaeological importance, being the site of a notable Roman legionary fortress, Isca Augusta, and an Iron Age hillfort. Close to the remains of Isca Augusta are the National Roman Legion Museum and the Roman Baths Museum. The town also has strong historical and literary associations: Geoffrey of Monmouth elevated the significance of Caerleon as a major centre of British history in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (c. 1136), and Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; (1859–1885) while staying in Caerleon.

==History==
===Pre-Roman history===
The area around Caerleon is of considerable archaeological interest, with a number of important Neolithic sites. By the Iron Age, the area was home to the powerful Silures tribe and appears to have been the centre of a wealthy trading network, both manufacturing and importing La Tène style goods. From the 5th century BC, the town was the location of a great Iron Age hillfort crowning a hill overlooking the River Usk and what would become the Roman port. The hillfort at Lodge Wood Camp is defended by three lines of massive ramparts and ditches, and is the largest fortified enclosure in South Wales.

The excavation in 2000 found that the hillfort had been continuously occupied from its founding in the 5th century BC until the construction and occupation of Isca Augusta (also called Isca Silurum) around 78 AD. There is no evidence that the fort was taken militarily, and the abandonment of the fort may have been part of the terms of peace. The fort was reoccupied during the Roman period and remained in use following the end of Roman rule in Britain, suggesting that some version of the Pre-Roman society survived the occupation.

===Roman era===

Caerleon is a site of considerable archaeological importance as the location of a Roman legionary fortress or &quot;castra&quot;. It was the headquarters for Legio II Augusta from about 75 to 300 AD, and on the hill above was the site of an Iron Age hillfort. The Romans called the site &quot;Isca&quot; after the River Usk (Welsh &quot;Wysg&quot;). The name &quot;Caerleon&quot; may derive from the Welsh for &quot;fortress of the legion&quot;; around 800 AD it was referred to as &quot;Cair Legeion guar Uisc&quot;.

Substantial excavated Roman remains can be seen, including the military amphitheatre, &quot;thermae&quot; (baths) and barracks occupied by the Roman legion. In August 2011 the remains of a Roman harbour were discovered in Caerleon. According to Gildas, followed by Bede, Roman Caerleon was the site of two early Christian martyrdoms, those of Julius and Aaron. Recent finds suggest Roman occupation of some kind as late as AD 380. Roman remains have also been discovered at The Mynde, itself a distinctive historical site.

===Middle Ages===
Caerleon features extensively in Medieval Welsh literature and Welsh Mythology, often as a model city against which other settlements are compared. When discussing the disastrous flooding of Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod in the time of Ambrosius Aurelianus, the author of the &quot;Triads of the Island of Britain&quot; notes that Medieval Caerleon is an exceptional city, &quot;superior to all the towns and fortifications in Cambria&quot;. 

Medieval Caerleon would remain an important administrative and religious centre for the Kingdom of Gwent, and was an early Metropolitan See associated with Saint Dubricius (who is commonly depicted with two crosiers, signifying the Bishoprics of Caerleon and Llandaff). At the Synod of Brefi in 545 AD, Dubricius is said to have given the See of Caerleon to Saint David, who would later move the seat to &quot;Mynyw&quot;. Caerleon was also the location of the Synod of Victory, officiated by Saint David around 569 AD. 

Another medieval saint, Cadoc, is associated with the church built over the &quot;principia&quot; (legionary headquarters). Saint Cadoc&#x27;s Church, is one of many churches associated with Cadoc&#x27;s travels, and may have been the location of a monastic cell in the 6th century.

===Norman era===
A Norman-style motte and bailey castle was built outside the eastern corner of the old Roman fort, possibly by the Welsh Lord of Caerleon, Caradog ap Gruffydd. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that a small colony of eight carucates of land (about 1.5 square miles) in the jurisdiction of Caerleon, seemingly just within the Welsh Lordship of Gwynllwg, was held by Turstin FitzRolf, standard bearer to William the Conqueror at Hastings, subject to William d&#x27;Ecouis, a magnate of unknown antecedents with lands in Hereford, Norfolk and other counties. Also listed on the manor were three Welshmen with as many ploughs and carucates, who continued their Welsh customs (&quot;leges Walensi viventes&quot;). Caerleon itself may have remained in Welsh hands, or may have changed hands frequently.

From the apparent banishment of Turstin by William II, Turstin&#x27;s lands were transferred in 1088 by Wynebald de Ballon, brother of Hamelin de Ballon who held Abergavenny further up the River Usk. At about the same time, Wynebald&#x27;s lands may have passed via his daughter to Henry Newmarch, possible illegitimate son of Bernard de Newmarch, c. 1155 the Welsh Lord of Caerleon, Morgan ab Owain, grandson of King Caradog ap Gruffudd, was recognized by Henry II. Subsequently, Caerleon continued in Welsh hands, subject to occasional battles with the Normans. Caerleon was an important market and port and possibly became a borough by 1171, although no independent charters exist. In 1171 Iorwerth ab Owain and his two sons destroyed the town of Caerleon and burned the Castle. Both castle and borough were seized by William Marshal from Morgan ap Hywel in 1217 and Caerleon castle was rebuilt in stone. The remains of many of the old Roman buildings stood to some height until this time and were probably demolished for their building materials.

===Glyndŵr Rising===
During the Glyndŵr Rising in 1402 Rhys Gethin, general for Owain Glyndŵr, took Caerleon castle by force, together with those of Newport, Cardiff, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Caerphilly and Usk. This was probably the last time Caerleon castle was ruined, though the walls were still standing in 1537 and the castle ruins only finally collapsed in 1739: their most obvious remnant is the Round Tower at the Hanbury Arms public house. The Tower is a Grade II* listed building.

===English Civil War===
Across the Afon Lwyd from Caerleon, in the region of Penrhos Farm, are two Civil War forts. In 1648 Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s troops camped overnight on Christchurch Hill, overlooking Newport, before their attack on Newport Castle the next day.

===18th and 19th centuries===

The old wooden bridge was destroyed in a storm in 1779 and the present stone bridge was erected in the early 19th century. Until the Victorian development of the downstream docks at Newport Docks, Caerleon acted as the major port on the River Usk. The wharf was located on the right bank, to the west of today&#x27;s river bridge which marked the limit of navigability for masted ships. A tinplate works and mills were established on the outskirts of the town, in Ponthir, around this time, and Caerleon expanded to become almost joined to Newport. A plaque on the Mynde wall in High Street references the Newport Rising of 1839 in which John Frost of Newport was a prominent figure in the Chartist movement. John Jenkins, owner of Mynde House and owner of Ponthir Tinplate Works, built the wall to keep demonstrators out. The name of the former Drovers&#x27; Arms on Goldcroft Common bore witness to the ancient drovers&#x27; road on the old road from Malpas. It is thought that the common itself was once the site of a cattle market.
===Modern histories===
An informative and wide-ranging history of Caerleon was published in 1970 by local amateur historian Primrose Hockey MBE, who was a founder member of Caerleon Local History Society. An archive of her local history collection is kept by the Gwent Record Office.

==In Welsh mythology and literature==
===Welsh mythology===
Caerleon features frequently in various works connected with Welsh mythology and Medieval Welsh literature.

In book three of his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniæ&quot;, Geoffrey of Monmouth gives the founder of the city as Belinus, the mythical King of the Britons. According to Geoffrey, Belinus repaired and founded many cities during a period of great wealth; he named this city &quot;Caerosc&quot; (The Caer on the Usk), and it became the most important of all the new cities he founded. Geoffrey also states that Belinus&#x27; son and heir, Gurguit Barbtruc was buried in Caerleon, which he fortified with walls and ornamented with new buildings.

Caerleon is also associated the legends around Dubricius and Saint David, and was commonly believed to be one of the earliest Metropolitan Sees in the Province of Britannia. In the &quot;Prophetiae Merlini&quot;, Geoffrey stated that &quot;St David&#x27;s shall put on the pall of the City of Legions&quot;; and most accounts state that Dubricius gave the see of Caerleon to St David voluntarily. David then translated the bishopric to &quot;Mynyw&quot; (known today as St David&#x27;s). Indeed in describing St David&#x27;s death, Geoffrey describes him as &quot;The pious archbishop of Legions, at the city of Menevia (Mynyw).&quot;

=== Arthurian legend ===
In his 1191 &quot;Itinerarium Cambriae&quot;, written about a tour of Wales in 1188 to recruit for the Third Crusade, the author Gerald of Wales says of Caerleon, &quot;the Roman ambassadors here received their audience at the court of the great king Arthur.&quot;

Geoffrey makes Arthur&#x27;s capital Caerleon and Thomas Malory has Arthur re-crowned there. The still extant amphitheatre at Caerleon has been associated with Arthur&#x27;s &#x27;Round Table; and has been suggested as a possible source for the legend.

For it was located in a delightful spot in Glamorgan, on the River Usk, not far from the Severn Sea. Abounding in wealth more than other cities, it was suited for such a ceremony. For the noble river I have named flows along it on one side, upon which the kings and princes who would be coming from overseas could be carried by ship. But on the other side, protected by meadow and woods, it was remarkable for royal palaces, so that it imitated Rome in the golden roofs of its buildings ... Famous for so many pleasant features, Caerleon was made ready for the announced feast. (&quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;)

Though the huge scale of the ruins, along with Caerleon&#x27;s importance as an urban centre in early medieval Kingdom of Gwent, may have inspired Geoffrey, the main historical source for Arthur&#x27;s link with &quot;the camp of the legion&quot; is the list of the twelve battles of Arthur in the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. However the &quot;urbs legionis&quot; mentioned there may be Chester – or even York. &quot;Camelot&quot; first appears in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Lancelot&quot;, though Chrétien also mentions Caerleon.
Caerleon also has associations with later Arthurian literature as the birthplace of the writer Arthur Machen who often used it as a location in his work. Alfred Tennyson lodged at The Hanbury Arms while he wrote his &quot;Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (later incorporated into his &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;). Today Caerleon has a modern statue of a knight, &quot;The Hanbury Knight&quot;, in reflecting stainless steel by Belgian sculptor Thierry Lauwers. In Michael Morpurgo&#x27;s novel &quot;Arthur, High King of Britain&quot;, Caerleon is the castle where Arthur unknowingly commits incest with his half-sister Morgaine, resulting in the conception of his son Mordred who will later bring about his downfall. Mary Stewart&#x27;s account of the Arthurian legends also mentions Caerleon as a place where Arthur held court. In that telling, the incest took place at Luguvalium.

==Modern Caerleon==
===Overview===
Caerleon is centred around a small common. Goldcroft Common is the only remaining of the seven commons of Caerleon. Most of the small businesses of Caerleon are near the common as is the Town Hall which has a World War I and World War II memorial garden. Caerleon library is located within the Town Hall and is associated with Newport Central Library. The intersection of High Street and Cross Street is known as The Square.

Buildings of note are Saint Cadoc&#x27;s Church, the National Roman Legion Museum, the Roman Baths Museum, The Mynde, The Priory Hotel, Caerleon Catholic Church and Rectory, Caerleon Endowed School, the Round Tower, the Toll House at Caerleon Bridge, The Malt House, former University of South Wales Caerleon Campus and St Cadoc&#x27;s Hospital. There are 86 listed buildings in Caerleon.

The historic remains of the Roman Legionary Fortress Isca Augusta is popular with tourists and school parties and there is a marked heritage trail in the town. The Millennium Wildlife Garden is a small nature garden on the banks of the River Usk. The hilltop vantage point at Christchurch provides panoramic views of the Vale of Usk and Bristol Channel.

The municipal playing fields are at Caerleon Broadway and a children&#x27;s playground is in Cold Bath Road. Private sport and leisure facilities are available at the Celtic Manor. Caerleon has a few restaurants, cafés and take-away food outlets and many public houses that have restaurant facilities. Ffwrrwm Arts and Crafts Centre is a small specialist shopping courtyard with a gallery restaurant and an eclectic display of sculpture.

===Governance===

Until January 2020 Caerleon was within the Wales European Parliament Constituency.

Caerleon is an electoral ward of Newport City Council, represented since 1995 by three councillors. The ward includes Christchurch and Bulmore. Caerleon is within the UK Parliamentary constituency of Newport East, the Senedd constituency of Newport West.

The community includes Christchurch and the Afon Gardens area of Ponthir.

===Geography===
The centre of Caerleon sits in the Vale of Usk and the River Usk forms part of the community&#x27;s southern boundary. In the north-west part of the town, across the railway bridges, the land rises sharply up to Lodge Wood and its hill fort. The community&#x27;s western boundary is formed by the A4042 road (Heidenheim Drive) and the northern boundary partly by the Malthouse Road and partly by the Afon Llwyd river which flows southwards to the River Usk along the town&#x27;s eastern side. Across the River Usk from Caerleon, to the south-east and east, St Julian&#x27;s Park, the village of Christchurch and the upland region around Christchurch Hill as far as the M4 motorway and the A449 road are also within the community, along with the hamlet of Ultra Pontem.

===Transportation===
====Road====

Caerleon is from Newport city centre and from Cwmbran. Caerleon is north of the M4 motorway. The B4596 (Caerleon Road) links Newport city centre to Caerleon via M4 Junction 25, crossing Caerleon Bridge into Caerleon High Street. The B4236 (Ponthir Road) links Caerleon to Cwmbran. The Usk Road links Caerleon to Usk.

A regular bus service links Caerleon to Newport city centre and Cwmbran. There is a limited City Sightseeing open-top bus service in summer months. A cycle and pedestrian walkway alongside the River Usk links Caerleon to Malpas and Newport city centre at Crindau, route 88 of the National Cycle Network.

====Rail====
Trains pass through Caerleon on the Welsh Marches Line, but do not stop at the closed Caerleon railway station. The nearest passenger stations are Newport, and Cwmbran. Transport for Wales have announced that Caerleon is a potential future station as part of the South Wales Metro project.

===Education===
Schools in Caerleon generally teach in English, with Welsh being taught as a second language. Welsh-medium education is provided at schools elsewhere in Newport. There are two primary schools in Caerleon: Charles Williams Church in Wales Primary School (one of the largest Church Primary Schools in Wales) and Lodge Hill Primary School. Welsh-medium primary education is provided at Ysgol Gymraeg Bro Teyrnon in Brynglas, Ysgol Gymraeg Casnewydd in Ringland and Ysgol Gymraeg Ifor Hael in Bettws. Caerleon Comprehensive School provides secondary education through the medium of English. Welsh-medium secondary education is provided at Ysgol Gyfun Gwent Is Coed, a comprehensive school in Duffryn that opened in 2016.

====Higher education====
A campus of the University of South Wales was located in Caerleon. The campus closed on 31 July 2016. The campus was the main campus of the University of Wales, Newport and the second largest campus of the University of South Wales after the merger of universities in 2013. It hosted a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, including education, sports and photography. The campus had extensive sports facilities, library, students&#x27; union shop, students&#x27; union bar and accommodation blocks.

During September 2014, It the University of South Wales announced that the Caerleon campus would close in 2016 with courses being integrated into the remaining campuses. The University sold the campus for housing development despite strong opposition to the proposed re-development from local residents. The Caerleon Civic Society asked Cadw, the body that looks after historic monuments and buildings in Wales, to give the Edwardian main building Grade II Listed building status to save it from demolition. In August 2016, the Welsh Government announced that they would recommend that the main building, gatehouses and gate piers be listed as &#x27;buildings of special architectural and historic interest&#x27;. The University of South Wales expressed their continued opposition to the proposed listing but the announcement was welcomed by local politicians and the Caerleon Civic Society. Grade II listing of the Main Building, the Principal&#x27;s Residence, Gate Piers and Caretaker&#x27;s / Gardener&#x27;s Lodge was confirmed on the 3 March 2017.

===Housing===
Historically housing was largely located on the west bank of the River Usk between Caerleon Bridge and Caerleon Common with a small number of houses on the east bank. A number of substantial housing developments have been created to the West of Caerleon: Lodge Hill, Home Farm, Roman Reach, Trinity View, Brooklea, and the Brades, as well as smaller cluster developments near the centre of the town. Substantial housing developments in nearby Ponthir and Cwmbran have increased traffic congestion in Caerleon.

===Historic public houses===

The town had a number of coaching inns in the early 19th century. A number remain including: The Priory (an abbey was first built here in 1179); the Olde Bull Inn (15th Century); the Hanbury Arms (1565); The Bell (originally built as a chapel in 1814); and the White Hart (a hotel later becoming a pub in 1815).

===Sport===
Caerleon has been home to a number of sporting competitions including:

====Newport Half Marathon====

It is a part of the Newport Half Marathon route, entering the town via the National Cycle Route 88 path, into the historic village centre past the Amphitheatre, over Caerleon Bridge and onto Caerleon Road back towards the city centre finish.

====Tour de Gwent====

On 8 July 2018 the Velothon Wales included Caerleon on a 140 km route, as well as two shorter routes of 125 km and 60 km.

In 2019 it was announced the Velothon Wales would not resume. Instead, the Tour de Gwent will be the main cycling event for South Wales each year, with a 93 mile route and other distances for different ability levels on offer. It will again start in Caerleon and head to Abergavenny, returning to Caerleon via the Wye Valley.

====Tour of Britain 2017–2018====

Caerleon has twice hosted the British national cycling tournament, in 2017 and 2018. It has welcomed international riders including Julian Alaphilippe, André Greipel, Tony Martin, and Geraint Thomas to the popular cycle routes in the area. It includes a category 2 climb at Belmont Hill which has proven popular with organisers.

On 10 September 2017 the Tour of Britain came to Caerleon along the 180.2 km (112 mi) western route from Worcester to the competition&#x27;s finish in Cardiff city centre. The peak of the British domestic cycling calendar, it saw a dramatic breakaway over Belmont Hill by riders Gorka Izagirre (Movistar) and Mark Stewart (An Post-Chain Reaction) which is a Category 2 climb and has been a feature of the Tour with a 9% average gradient. The riders were only eventually caught by the peloton near Cardiff at the close of the stage. The stage was won by Edvald Boasson Hagen of Team Dimension Data.
On 2 September 2018 Caerleon again hosted the Tour of Britain route as it headed east from Pembrey to Newport, a flat stage of 175 km (109 mi). The event was Welsh Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas&#x27; first competition following his success in France, with the route following near his birthplace in Cardiff. The stage was won by André Greipel of Lotto–Soudal. The event organisers sent riders from Newport city centre to Caerleon via Sustrans National Cycle Route 88, which was mostly flat along the Usk riverside. The route passed the Roman fortress towards the countryside around the Celtic Manor Resort, and then into Usk. The King of the Mountains stage was again set at nearby Belmont Hill, with Tour de France winner Thomas famously describing the climb as &#x27;too steep&#x27; after he lost lead position in the peloton to climber Alaphilippe.

====2010 Ryder Cup====
The local ward golf club was included in promotional material for the 2010 Ryder Cup which was hosted at the nearby Celtic Manor Resort.

Caerleon Golf Club is managed by the Celtic Manor Resort, and is a 9 hole municipal golf course, driving range and golf clubhouse. During winter months the golf course is prone to flooding due to its location alongside the River Usk.

====Other sports====
Caerleon Bowls Club has an outdoor green and recently became home of the city&#x27;s Newport Athletic Bowls Club which moved from Rodney Parade. The association football club Caerleon A.F.C. is based in Caerleon along with two rugby union clubs; Newport High School Old Boys RFC and Caerleon RFC whose grounds are less than a mile apart. Both rugby clubs have large junior sections and Caerleon Junior Youth Football Club is a substantial junior football club. Bulmore Lido was opened in Caerleon in July 1934 land with an open-air swimming pool, cafe and restaurant, closing in the 1980s.

Newport Racecourse at Caerleon staged National Hunt racing from the 1840s until its closure in 1948. It hosted the Welsh Grand National at Easter 1948, the only time the race was held at Newport. Following the closure of the course the Welsh Grand National was transferred to Chepstow. The racecourse also staged the International Cross Country Championships on six occasions between 1906 and 1951. The course was located on what is now the golf club and the comprehensive school.

===Culture and community===
====Caerleon Festival====

Caerleon has hosted an arts festival in July each year since 2003, established initially to welcome participants and sculptors from around the world. Many of the sizeable sculptures are retained around Caerleon as a Sculpture park and local landmarks. The arts festival coincides with the Roman military re-enactment in the amphitheatre which demonstrates Roman military armour, infantry tactics, cavalry tactics, equipment and siege engines such as ballistae. Recent developments with the festival have seen expansion, with the inclusion of a literary festival, food and drink offerings and music events staged at venues including Caerleon Town Hall and St Cadocs Church. The open-air Roman amphitheatre hosts an annual Shakespeare play. The &#x27;Big Free Weekend&#x27; alongside the River Usk is two full days of free live music and dance on three stages at the Hanbury Quay, the 17th century Bell Inn marquee and the Festival Meadow marquee. A diverse range of performers are featured including folk, idie, rock, choirs, celtic and international dance. The Festival field hosts displays, performances and vendors of crafts and visual arts.

====Mari Lwyd====

Writing in 1951, local historian and folklorist Fred Hando described the traditional journey through Caerleon of the Mari Lwyd or &quot;Venerable Mary&quot;, a tradition similar to that of Hoodening found in Kent, Padstow and Cheshire, and involving a man dressed with a horse&#x27;s skull. The jaw of the skull could be made to move, with the aid of rods. Hando&#x27;s informant, Gus Sergeant of Bulmoor, reported that the Mari Lwyd had not been seen in the town for at least 20 years, but he was still able to describe it:
We filled the eye-holes with wadding and &#x27;pop alleys&#x27; and fixed great ears made of wadding stiffened with cardboard; then we stuck rosettes on the sides of the skull and strung long coloured ribbons as reins.
One man acted as leader of the Mari, holding the ribbons, and then came the Mari itself draped in a white sheet. It was followed by three singers, who sang in Welsh although &quot;they didn&#x27;t understand the words&quot;. On occasion, the procession of the Mari Lwyd would start as far north as Newbridge-on-Usk and proceed through the town, ending as far south as Goldcliff. The party would be invited into houses along the way and given &quot;money and home-made cakes and gallons of beer&quot;. Another of Hando&#x27;s informants provides a description, dated 1841, of the Yuletide tradition:

The custom of chaunting at their neighbours&#x27; doors on the Twelfth Night ... on which occasion they are fantastically dressed with ribbons of various colours. One of the party carries a horse&#x27;s head decorated in the same manner. Representations of trees, to which are appended apples and oranges, are also carried about, and on one of the branches an artificial bird, called &quot;Aderyn Pica Llwyd&quot; (the grey hobgoblin bird) is placed.

<doc id="161835" wikidata="Q229351" url="?curid=161835" title="Tamara de Lempicka">
<text>Tamara Łempicka (; 16 June 1894 – 18 March 1980), known outside Poland as Tamara de Lempicka, was a Polish painter who spent her working life in France and the United States. She is best known for her polished Art Deco portraits of aristocrats and the wealthy, and for her highly stylized paintings of nudes.

Born in Warsaw, records have long asserted her birthname was &quot;Tamara Rozalia Gurwik-Górska&quot;, though documents have uncovered her true name as &quot;Tamara Rosa Hurwitz&quot;. She briefly moved to Saint Petersburg where she married Tadeusz Łempicki, a prominent Polish lawyer, then travelled to Paris. She studied painting with Maurice Denis and André Lhote. Her style was a blend of late, refined cubism and the neoclassical style, particularly inspired by the work of Jean-Dominique Ingres. She was an active participant in the artistic and social life of Paris between the wars. In 1928, she became the mistress of Baron Raoul Kuffner, a wealthy art collector from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, divorcing Tadeusz Łempicki that same year. After the death of Kuffner&#x27;s wife in 1933, Łempicka married Kuffner in 1934, and thereafter she became known in the press as &quot;The Baroness with a Brush&quot;.

Following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, she and her husband moved to the United States and she painted celebrity portraits, as well as still lifes and, in the 1960s, some abstract paintings. Her work was out of fashion after World War II, but made a comeback in the late 1960s, with the rediscovery of Art Deco. She moved to Mexico in 1974, where she died in 1980. At her request, her ashes were scattered over the Popocatépetl volcano.

==Early life==
===Warsaw and St. Petersburg (1894–1917)===
She was born on 16 June 1894 in either Warsaw, which was then part of Congress Poland, or in St. Petersburg, though the widely accepted place of birth is Warsaw. Her father was Boris (born Benno) Gurwik-Górski, a Russian-Jewish attorney for a French trading company, and her mother was Malwina Dekler, a Polish-Jewish socialite who had lived most of her life abroad and who met her husband at one of the European spas. Both of her parents were baptized in 1891 in the Warsaw congregation of the Polish Reformed Church; Tamara and her two siblings, Stanisław and Adrianna, were baptized as Protestant converts at Moscow&#x27;s Reformed Church in 1897. 

Tamara was raised in Warsaw by her mother and grandparents, Bernard and Klementyna Dekler, who were members of the social and Polish cultural elite – they were friends with Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Artur Rubinstein. Their family grave is located in the Jewish cemetery on Okopowa Street in Warsaw. When Tamara was ten, her mother commissioned a pastel portrait of her by a prominent local artist. She detested posing and was dissatisfied with the finished work. She took the pastels, had her younger sister pose, and made her first portrait.

In 1911, her parents sent her to a boarding school in Lausanne, Switzerland, but she was bored and she feigned illness to be permitted to leave the school. Instead, her grandmother took her on a tour of Italy, where she developed her interest in art. After her parents divorced in 1912, she chose to spend the summer with her wealthy Aunt Stefa in Saint Petersburg. There, in 1915, she met and fell in love with a prominent Polish lawyer, Tadeusz Łempicki (1888–1951). Her family offered him a large dowry, and they were married 30 December 1915 in a Roman Catholic church in Tsarskoye Selo (earlier studies claimed a 1916 marriage in the chapel of the Knights of Malta in St. Petersburg).

The Russian Revolution in November 1917 overturned their comfortable life. In December 1917, Tadeusz Łempicki was arrested in the middle of the night by the Cheka, the secret police. Tamara searched the prisons for him, and with the help of the Swedish consul, to whom she offered her favors, she secured his release. They traveled to Copenhagen then to London and finally to Paris, where Tamara&#x27;s family had also found refuge.

==Career==

===Paris (1918–1939)===
In Paris, the Łempickis lived for a while from the sale of family jewels. Tadeusz proved unwilling or unable to find suitable work. Their daughter, Maria Krystyna &quot;Kizette&quot;, was born around 1919, adding to their financial needs. Lempicka decided to become a painter at her sister&#x27;s suggestion, and studied both at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts and Académie de la Grande Chaumière with Maurice Denis and then with André Lhote, who was to have a greater influence on her style. Her first paintings were still lifes and portraits of her daughter Kizette and her neighbor. She sold her first paintings through the Galerie Colette-Weil, which allowed her to exhibit at the &quot;Salon des indépendents&quot;, the &quot;Salon d&#x27;automne&quot;, and the &quot;Salon des moins de trente ans&quot;, for promising young painters. She exhibited at the &quot;Salon d&#x27;automne&quot; for the first time in 1922. During this period, she signed her paintings &quot;Lempitzki&quot;—the masculine form of her name.

Her breakthrough came in 1925, with the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts, which later gave its name to the style Art Deco. She exhibited her paintings in two of the major venues, the &quot;Salon des Tuileries&quot; and the &quot;Salon des femmes peintres&quot;. Her paintings were spotted by American journalists from &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and other fashion magazines, and her name became known. In the same year, she had her first major exposition in Milan, Italy, organized for her by Count Emmanuele Castelbarco. For this show, Lempicka painted 28 new works in six months. During her Italian tour, she took a new lover, the Marquis Sommi Picenardi. She was also invited to meet the famous Italian poet and playwright Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio. She visited him twice at his villa on Lake Garda, seeking to paint his portrait; he, in turn, was set on seduction. After her unsuccessful attempts to secure the commission, she went away angry, while d&#x27;Annunzio also remained unsatisfied.

In 1927, Lempicka won her first major award, the first prize at the Exposition Internationale des Beaux Arts in Bordeaux, France, for her portrait of &quot;Kizette on the Balcony&quot;. In 1929, another portrait of Kizette, at her First Communion, won a bronze medal at the international exposition in Poznań, Poland.

In 1928 she was divorced from Tadeusz Łempicki. That same year, she met Raoul Kuffner, a baron of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and an art collector. His title was not an ancient one; his family had been granted the title by the second-to-last Austro-Hungarian Emperor, Franz-Joseph I, because Kuffner&#x27;s family had been the supplier of beef and beer to the imperial court. He owned properties of considerable size in eastern Europe. He commissioned her to paint his mistress, the Spanish dancer Nana de Herrera; after its completion, Lempicka and the baron began their relationship. She bought an apartment on rue Méchain in Paris and had it decorated by the modernist architect Robert Mallet-Stevens and her own sister Adrienne de Montaut.
The furniture was by René Herbst.
The austere, functional interiors appeared in decoration magazines.

In 1929, Lempicka painted one of her best-known works, &quot;Autoportrait (Tamara in a Green Bugatti)&quot;, for the cover of the German fashion magazine &quot;Die Dame&quot;. This showed her at the wheel of a Bugatti racing car wearing a leather helmet and gloves and wrapped in a gray scarf, a portrait of cold beauty, independence, wealth, and inaccessibility. In fact, she did not own a Bugatti automobile; her own car was a small yellow Renault, which was stolen one night when she and her friends were celebrating at La Rotonde in Montparnasse.

She traveled to the United States for the first time in 1929 to paint a portrait of Joan Jeffery, the fiancée of the American oilman Rufus T. Bush, and to arrange a show of her work at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. The exposition was a success, but the money she earned was lost when the bank she used collapsed following the stock market crash of 1929. The portrait of Jeffery was completed but put into storage following the couple&#x27;s divorce in 1932. It was sold by Christie&#x27;s in 2004 following the death of Joan (now Vanderpool). 

Lempicka&#x27;s career reached a peak during the 1930s. She painted portraits of King Alfonso XIII of Spain and Queen Elizabeth of Greece and museums began to collect her works. In 1933, she traveled to Chicago, where her pictures were shown alongside those of Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Santiago Martínez Delgado, and Willem de Kooning. Despite the Great Depression, she continued to receive commissions and showed her work at several Paris galleries.

The wife of Baron Kuffner died in 1933. De Lempicka married him on 3 February 1934 in Zurich. She became alarmed by the rise of the Nazis and persuaded her husband to sell most of his properties in Hungary and to move his fortune and his belongings to Switzerland.

===The United States and Mexico (1939–1980)===
In the winter of 1939, following the outbreak of World War II, Lempicka and her husband moved to the United States. They settled first in Los Angeles. The Paul Reinhard Gallery organized a show of her work, and they moved to Beverly Hills, settling into the former residence of the film director King Vidor. Shows of her work were organized at the Julian Levy Gallery in New York, the Courvoisier Galleries in San Francisco, and the Milwaukee Institute of Art, but her shows did not have the success she had hoped for. Her daughter Kizette was able to escape from occupied France via Lisbon and joined them in Los Angeles in 1941. Kizette married a Texas geologist, Harold Foxhall. In 1943, Baron Kuffner and de Lempicka relocated to New York City.

In the postwar years, she continued a frenetic social life, but she had fewer commissions for society portraits. Her art deco style looked anachronistic in the period of postwar modernism and abstract expressionism. She expanded her subject matter to include still lifes, and in 1960 she began to paint abstract works and to use a palette knife instead of her smooth earlier brushwork. She sometimes reworked earlier pieces in her new style. The crisp and direct &quot;Amethyste&quot; (1946) became the pink and fuzzy &quot;Girl with Guitar&quot; (1963). She had a show at the Ror Volmar Gallery in Paris in May and June 1961, but it did not revive her earlier success.

Baron Kuffner died of a heart attack in November 1961 on the ocean liner &quot;Liberté&quot; en route to New York. Following his death, Lempicka sold many of her possessions and made three around-the-world trips by ship. In 1963, Lempicka moved to Houston, Texas, to be with Kizette and her family and retired from her life as a professional artist. She continued to repaint her earlier works. She repainted her well-known &quot;Autoportrait&quot; (1929) twice between 1974 and 1979; &quot;Autoportrait II&quot; was sold, though she hung &quot;Autoportrait III&quot; in her retirement apartments, where it would remain until her death. The last work she painted was the fourth copy of her painting of St. Anthony.

In 1974, she decided to move to Cuernavaca, Mexico. After the death of her husband in 1979, Kizette moved to Cuernavaca to take care of de Lempicka, whose health was declining. De Lempicka died in her sleep on 18 March 1980. Following her wishes, her ashes were scattered over the volcano Popocatépetl.

==Rediscovery==
A resurgence of interest in Art Deco began in the late 1960s. A retrospective of her work was held at the Luxembourg Gallery in Paris in summer 1972, and received positive reviews. An extensive catalogue was published in Italy by editor Franco Maria Ricci in 1977. After her death, her early Art Deco paintings were being shown and purchased once again. A stage play, &quot;Tamara&quot;, was inspired by her meeting with Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio and was first staged in Toronto; it then ran in Los Angeles for eleven years (1984–1995) at the Hollywood American Legion Post 43, making it the longest running play in Los Angeles, and some 240 actors were employed over the years. The play was also subsequently produced at the Seventh Regiment Armory in New York City. In 2005, the actress and artist Kara Wilson performed &quot;Deco Diva&quot;, a one-woman stage play based on Lempicka&#x27;s life. Her life and her relationship with one of her models are fictionalized in Ellis Avery&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Nude&quot;, which won the American Library Association Stonewall Book Awards Barbara Gittings Literature Award for 2013.

==Style and subjects==

Lempicka&#x27;s own description of her work:I was the first woman to make clear paintings, and that was the origin of my success ... Among a hundred canvases, mine were always recognizable. The galleries tended to show my pictures in the best rooms, because they attracted people. My work was clear and finished. I looked around me and could only see the total destruction of painting. The banality in which art had sunk gave me a feeling of disgust. I was searching for a craft that no longer existed; I worked quickly with a delicate brush. I was in search of technique, craft, simplicity and good taste. My goal: never copy. Create a new style, with luminous and brilliant colors, rediscover the elegance of my models.

She was one of the best-known painters of the Art Deco style, a group which included Jean Dupas, Diego Rivera, Josep Maria Sert, Louis Lozowick, and Rockwell Kent, but unlike these artists, who often painted large murals with crowds of subjects, she focused almost exclusively on portraits.

Her first teacher at the Academie Ranson in Paris was Maurice Denis, who taught her according to his celebrated maxim: &quot;Remember that a painting, before it is a war horse, a nude woman or some anecdote, is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order&quot;. He was primarily a decorative artist, who taught her the traditional craftsmanship of painting. Her other influential teacher was André Lhote, who taught her to follow a softer, more refined form of cubism that did not shock the viewer or look out of place in a luxurious living room. Her cubism was far from that of Pablo Picasso or Georges Braque; for her, Picasso &quot;embodied the novelty of destruction&quot;. Lempicka combined this soft cubism with a neoclassical style, inspired largely by Ingres, particularly his famous &quot;Turkish Bath&quot;, with its exaggerated nudes crowding the canvas. Her painting &quot;La Belle Rafaëlla&quot; was especially influenced by Ingres. Lempicka&#x27;s technique, following Ingres, was clean, precise, and elegant, but at the same time charged with sensuality and a suggestion of vice. The cubist elements of her paintings were usually in the background, behind the Ingresque figures. The smooth skin textures and equally smooth, luminous fabrics of the clothes were the dominant elements of her paintings.

Known especially for her portraits of wealthy aristocrats, she also painted highly stylized nudes. The nudes are usually female, whether depicted alone or in groups; &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; (1931) features one of her few male nudes. After the mid-1930s, when her Art Deco portraits had gone out of fashion and &quot;a serious mystical crisis, combined with a deep depression during an economic recession, provoked a radical change in her work&quot;, she turned to painting more traditional subject matter in the same style. She painted a number of Madonnas and turbaned women inspired by Renaissance paintings, as well as mournful subjects such as &quot;The Mother Superior&quot; (1935), an image of a nun with a tear rolling down her cheek, and &quot;Escape&quot; (1940), which depicts refugees. Of these, art historian Gilles Néret wrote, &quot;The baroness&#x27;s more &#x27;virtuous&#x27; subjects are, it must be said, lacking in conviction when compared with the sophisticated and gallant works on which her former glory had been founded&quot;. Lempicka introduced elements of Surrealism in paintings such as &quot;Surrealist Hand&quot; (c. 1947) and in some of her still lifes, such as &quot;The Key&quot; (1946). Between 1953 and the early 1960s, Lempicka painted hard-edged abstractions that bear a stylistic similarity to the Purism of the 1920s. Her last works, painted in warm tones with a palette knife, have usually been considered her least successful.

==Personal life==
Lempicka placed a high value on working to produce her own fortune, famously saying, &quot;There are no miracles, there is only what you make&quot;. She took this personal success and created a hedonistic lifestyle for herself, accompanied by intense love affairs within high society.

Her daughter Kizette rarely saw Lempicka but was immortalized in her paintings. Lempicka painted her repeatedly, creating a striking portrait series: &quot;Kizette in Pink&quot; (1926), &quot;Kizette on the Balcony&quot; (1927), &quot;Kizette Sleeping&quot; (1934), &quot;Portrait of Baroness Kizette&quot; (1954–1955), among others. Some of Lempicka&#x27;s other paintings depict women who resemble Kizette.

=== Bisexuality ===
Lempicka was bisexual. Her affairs with both men and women were conducted in ways that were considered scandalous at the time. She often used formal and narrative elements in her portraits, and her nude studies included themes of desire and seduction. In the 1920s, she became closely associated with lesbian and bisexual women in writing and artistic circles, among them Violet Trefusis, Vita Sackville-West, and Colette. Her close friend and lover the French poet Ira Perrot was the subject of at least eight of Lempicka&#x27;s paintings as well as several drawings during the 1920s and 1930s. Most notable among these was Lempicka&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Portrait on Ira P.&quot; (1931), featuring Ira in a sinuous white satin gown and red shawl, holding an armful of white calla lilies. After Lempicka&#x27;s daughter Kizette, no other subject was featured as frequently in Lempicka&#x27;s art as Perrot. Lempicka also became involved with Suzy Solidor, a nightclub singer at the Boîte de Nuit, whose portrait she later painted.

==Legacy==
American singer Madonna is an admirer and collector of Lempicka&#x27;s work. Madonna has featured Lempicka&#x27;s work in her music videos for &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; (1987), &quot;Express Yourself&quot; (1989), &quot;Vogue&quot; (1990) and &quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot; (1998). She also used paintings by Lempicka on the sets of her 1987 Who&#x27;s That Girl, 1990 Blond Ambition, and 2023 Celebration Tour world tours.

Other notable Lempicka collectors include actor Jack Nicholson, singer-actress Barbra Streisand, and fashion designer Wolfgang Joop.

Robert Dassanowsky&#x27;s book &quot;Telegrams from the Metropole: Selected Poems 1980–1998&quot; includes the poems &quot;Tamara de Lempicka&quot; and &quot;La Donna d&#x27;Oro&quot; dedicated to Kizette de Lempicka.

Lempicka&#x27;s paintings are featured on the UK book covers of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; by Ayn Rand.

On 16 May 2018, in celebration of the 120th anniversary of her birth, Google made her the subject of the daily Google Doodle.

In July 2018, a biographical musical, &quot;Lempicka&quot;, premiered at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. The show later played at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2022 and on Broadway from April to May of 2024. The musical starred Eden Espinosa as Łempicka and was directed by Tony winner Rachel Chavkin. In April 2024, Espinosa was nominated for a Tony Award for her portrayal.

From September 2022 until March 2023, the National Museum in Kraków held a major exhibition of her works from museums and private collections in Europe and the USA entitled &quot;Łempicka&quot;.

In January 2023, Jeff Ruby Culinary Entertainment, a Cincinnati, Ohio-based, multistate restaurant company, named its first specialized event space The Lempicka to acknowledge the influence of her aesthetic on the interior design of its restaurants. The center opened in June 2023.

&quot;The True Story of Tamara de Lempicka &amp; The Art of Survival&quot; is a 2024 feature documentary about the painter through her artwork. The film covers her rise in 1920s Paris, her move to the United States, and her revival in the current art market. The documentary includes newly found archival evidence regarding Lempicka&#x27;s birthdate and the Hurwitz family&#x27;s conversion from Judaism to Calvinism.

==Art market==
In November 2019, the Lempicka painting &quot;La Tunique rose&quot; (1927) was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for $13.4 million. In February 2020, her painting &quot;Portrait of Marjorie Ferry&quot; (1932) set a record for a work by Lempicka by fetching £16.3 million ($21.2 million) at the Impressionist and Modern Art Evening Sale at Christie&#x27;s, London.

<doc id="161851" wikidata="Q1595409" url="?curid=161851" title="Muskingum River">
<text>The Muskingum River ( ; ) is a tributary of the Ohio River, approximately long, in southeastern Ohio in the United States. An important commercial route in the 19th century, it flows generally southward through the eastern hill country of Ohio. Via the Ohio, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. The river is navigable for much of its length through a series of locks and dams.

==Course==
The Muskingum is formed at Coshocton in east-central Ohio by the confluence of the Walhonding and Tuscarawas rivers. It flows in a meandering course southward past Conesville and Dresden to Zanesville, and then southeastward past South Zanesville, Philo, Gaysport, Malta, McConnelsville, Beverly, Lowell, Stockport and Devola. It joins the Ohio at Marietta.

Along its course the Muskingum collects Wills Creek near Conesville; Wakatomika Creek at Dresden; the Licking River at Zanesville; Moxahala Creek at South Zanesville; and Wolf Creek near Beverly.

==History==
The name &quot;Muskingum&quot; derives from the Shawnee word &quot;mshkikwam&quot; &#x27;swampy ground&#x27;. In Lenape &quot;Muskingum&quot; was taken to mean &#x27;elk&#x27;s eye&#x27; (&quot;mus wəshkinkw&quot;) by folk etymology, as if &lt; &quot;mus&quot; &#x27;elk&#x27; + &quot;wəshkinkw&quot; &#x27;its eye&#x27;. Moravian missionary David Zeisberger wrote that the Muskingum River was called Elk&#x27;s Eye &quot;because of the numbers of elk that formerly fed on its banks, these animals being found there even at the present time [1779-1780]...&quot; Historically, it was also the name of a large Wyandot town along the river.

As part of an expedition to assert French dominance throughout the entire Ohio valley, on August 15, 1749, a leaden plate claiming the region for France was buried at the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio rivers by Pierre Joseph Céloron.

Noted frontier explorer Christopher Gist reached the Big Sandy Creek tributary of the river on December 4, 1751. Traveling downriver, he recorded arriving on December 14 at the western Wyandot town of Muskingum, at present-day Coshocton. There he remained for the following month.

Marietta was founded in 1788 as the first permanent American settlement in the Northwest Territory, at the mouth of the Muskingum River on the Ohio River. The Big Bottom Massacre occurred along its banks in 1791.

Zanesville was settled by European Americans in 1799 at the site where Zane&#x27;s Trace crossed the Muskingum at the mouth of the Licking River. Later, the National (Cumberland) Road crossed the Muskingum at Zanesville. In the mid-19th century the Muskingum was an important commercial shipping route, with dams and locks controlling the water level to allow boats to travel up and down the river. With the decrease in use of water-based transportation in Ohio by the 1920s, the locks fell into disrepair.

Since the 1960s, the locks have been repaired to enable pleasure craft to travel the entire navigable length of the river. The Muskingum waterway is one of the few remaining systems in the US to use hand-operated river locks. The navigation system has been designated a national Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. In 2006, it was designated &quot;An Ohio Water Trail;&quot; this designation provides for increased canoe access on the river.

Located north of the Mason–Dixon line, from around 1812 to 1861 the Muskingum River was a major Underground Railroad route used by fugitive slaves escaping from the South on their journey north to Lake Erie and Canada.

==Nonprofit organizations==
The Friends of the Lower Muskingum River is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit land trust based in Marietta, Ohio, concerned with protection of the Muskingum River and adjacent lands. The Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District is a quasi-governmental entity concerned with flood control on the river.

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Muskingum River has also been known as:
* Big Muskingum River
* Elk River
* Mouskindom River
* Mushkingum River
* Muskingham River
* Riviere Chiagnez

<doc id="161853" wikidata="Q5654592" url="?curid=161853" title="Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays">
<text>The Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays (&quot;Coast Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays&quot; until 1925) (a.k.a. CD/HD Manila Bay) were a United States Army Coast Artillery Corps harbor defense command, part of the Philippine Department of the United States Army from circa 1910 through early World War II. The command primarily consisted of four forts on islands at the entrance to Manila Bay and one fort on an island in Subic Bay.

==Background and construction==
The United States acquired the Philippines as a territory as a result of the Spanish–American War in 1898. The Taft Board of 1905 recommended extensive, then-modern fortifications at the entrance to Manila Bay. The islands there had been declared military reservations on 11 April 1902. Accordingly, El Fraile, Carabao, Corregidor, Grande, and Caballo Islands in the Philippines were to be fortified and incorporated into the harbor defenses of Manila and Subic Bays, protecting the bases of the US Asiatic Fleet and the Philippines&#x27; capital and chief port of Manila. From circa 1905 to 1915 the following forts were built: Fort Mills (Corregidor), Fort Hughes (Caballo Island), Fort Drum (El Fraile Island), and Fort Frank (Carabao Island) at the entrance to Manila Bay, as well as Fort Wint (Grande Island) at the entrance to Subic Bay. The forts were designed for one purpose: to prevent enemy surface vessels from entering Manila Bay or Subic Bay. They were designed before airplanes became important in war, and (except for Fort Drum) were vulnerable to air and high-angle artillery attack, being protected only by camouflage. Except for the mortar batteries, the turrets of Fort Drum, and the two guns of the 1920s Batteries Smith and Hearn, the forts&#x27; guns had restricted arcs of fire of about 170°, and could only bear on targets entering the bay from the west.

In an exercise in 1907 at Subic Bay, a US Marine battalion of the Advanced Base Force commanded by Major Eli K. Cole emplaced forty-four heavy guns for coast defense in a ten-week period, due to the Eight-eight fleet war scare with Japan. These were operated by the Marines until circa 1910, when Fort Wint on Grande Island was completed.

Corregidor was by far the largest fortified island in the Philippines, strategically located at the mouth of Manila Bay. Fort Mills was built there and was substantially complete by 1911. At that time the island had six guns on disappearing carriages, twelve mortars, two disappearing guns, five disappearing guns, and four guns on pedestal mounts. Three additional batteries of two guns each followed within a few years; Battery Keyes in 1913 and Batteries Cushing and Hanna in 1919. As the only fort on a sizable island, Corregidor had most of the barracks along with administrative and headquarters buildings. The island also had 13 miles of electric railway, an unusual feature in US forts.

Fort Drum on El Fraile Island, completed in 1914, was the second-most powerful fort in Manila Bay and the most unusual. The island was partway between Corregidor and the Cavite province shore south of that island. El Fraile was razed to the waterline and a &quot;concrete battleship&quot; structure built on it. Fort Drum was both the only sea fort and the only fort with turrets in the post-1885 US fort systems. Two turrets housing two guns each were atop the fort. The 14-inch guns were the only M1909 14-inch guns deployed; they were specially designed for Fort Drum&#x27;s turrets. Each side of the fort housed a pair of guns in casemates. The turrets proved impregnable to both air attack and plunging fire from Japanese howitzers, remaining in action until the surrender on 6 May 1942.

Forts Hughes and Frank, both completed by 1914 (except Fort Hughes&#x27; mortars in 1919), were generally similar in that each had two one-gun batteries of guns. Fort Hughes was just south of Corregidor, while Fort Frank was at the southern entrance to Manila Bay, close to the Cavite province shore. In addition to the 14-inch guns, Fort Hughes also had four mortars, two disappearing guns, and two guns. Fort Frank also had eight 12-inch mortars and two 3-inch guns.

Fort Wint was completed in 1910, on Grande Island at the mouth of Subic Bay, at some distance from the other fort. It had the least armament; two disappearing guns, two disappearing guns, and four guns.

During the American participation in World War I CD Manila Bay had an authorized strength of 21 companies. In 1919 the defenses&#x27; commander was Colonel Calvin Hearn. The 59th Coast Artillery Regiment was transferred to the Philippines in 1921, including some GPF guns. From 1922 parts of the defenses were garrisoned by units of the Philippine Scouts, which were US Regular Army units primarily composed of Filipino enlisted men and US officers. In 1922-23 fifteen companies of Philippine Scouts were authorized, initially numbered the 257th through 289th companies of Coast Artillery. In 1924, as part of a forcewide conversion of the Coast Artillery Corps to a regimental system, the 59th CA was reorganized as a tractor drawn regiment and the 91st and 92nd Coast Artillery Regiments (Philippine Scouts) were created from the existing companies. In 1935 the 59th CA was further reorganized as a harbor defense regiment.

The last new armament in HD Manila Bay until 1940 was significant but small in quantity: Batteries Smith and Hearn at Fort Mills, completed in 1921. These had one M1895 gun each on an M1917 long-range carriage, with an elevation of 35° and 360° of traverse, with range increased from on a disappearing carriage to . The disadvantage was that the guns were completely unprotected. This type of battery was also built at eight other harbor defense commands in CONUS, Hawaii, and Panama. In 1923 the Washington Naval Treaty prohibited additional fortifications in the Pacific, thus the Philippine forts received no further weapons until after 1936, when Japan withdrew from the treaty, rendering it void. Ironically, had these batteries been modernized, they would have been casemated, restricting them to a 180° field of fire, and would have been less useful against the Japanese on Bataan. One result of the Washington Naval Treaty was the diversion of twelve 240 mm howitzers on a ship bound for the Philippines to Hawaii, where they were placed on fixed mountings on Oahu. The total lack of mobile high-angle artillery was a major impediment to the defense of the Philippines.

Spare gun barrels were provided near some batteries on Corregidor, including Smith and Hearn, due to the inability to re-line used barrels except at specialized facilities in the continental United States (CONUS).

===Minefields===
Manila Bay and Subic Bay had Army-operated minefields available from circa 1915 (not usually deployed in peacetime) as well as naval mines laid in 1941. These minefields were designed to stop all vessels except submarines and shallow-draft surface craft. In Manila Bay, two controlled minefields were placed, one extending west from Corregidor to La Monja Island, and the other extending north from Corregidor to the Bataan Peninsula east of Mariveles Bay. Both of these were operated from Corregidor. Also, in mid-1941 US Navy minefields of contact mines were laid between Mariveles Bay and La Monja Island, and between Corregidor and Carabao Islands, to close off the bay approaches not covered by Army mines. The Subic Bay minefield was laid in July 1941 and operated from Fort Wint, with the controlled Army mines in the ship channel, and naval mines to the sides of the channel.

On the night of 16–17 December 1941 the passenger ship SS &quot;Corregidor&quot; (formerly HMS &quot;Engadine&quot;) hit a mine and sank near Corregidor Island. The ship departed Manila that night without obtaining permission from the US Navy&#x27;s Inshore Patrol, which meant the minefield operators were not alerted that a friendly ship was departing the harbor. The minefield&#x27;s usual state in wartime was active, which meant they would detonate on contact. This probably applied to the mines in the designated ship channel as well. When the ship was spotted, some accounts state that Colonel Paul Bunker, commander of the Seaward Defenses, ordered that the minefield remain active. Due to wartime conditions, no official investigation was ever conducted, leaving many questions open. The location at which the ship sank has not been determined, for example. Accounts state that US Army officers informally told Filipino reporters that the mines were placed in safe mode immediately after the sinking. The ship was crowded with 1,200 to 1,500 persons, mostly Filipino civilians evacuating to Mindanao. 150 Philippine Army personnel and seven Americans were on board, along with several 2.95-inch mountain guns badly needed by the forces in the southern Philippines. Three PT boats (&quot;PT-32&quot;, &quot;PT-34&quot; and &quot;PT-35&quot;) picked up 282 survivors, of which seven later died.

===The Malinta Tunnel===

The main part of the Malinta Tunnel complex was built on Corregidor from 1932 to 1934, with construction continuing until the Philippines was invaded by Japan in December 1941. Most US forts of this era had only small underground facilities, and this tunnel complex was the largest in the US coastal defense system. Due to the Washington Naval Treaty&#x27;s prohibition on new fortifications, most of the complex was built without appropriated funds, using Filipino convict labor for unskilled tasks, and explosives slated for disposal. During the siege, the Malinta Tunnel proved important to the survival of the Philippine government, the military high command, the medical staff, and numerous civilians.

==World War II==

On 26 July 1941 Lieutenant General Douglas MacArthur was recalled to active duty and made the commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), which included the Philippine Scouts and the Philippine Commonwealth Army. MacArthur had been an official US advisor to the Philippine forces as a Philippine Field Marshal from 1935 to 1937, and had continued this function as a civilian since his retirement from the U.S. Army at the end of that period. In July 1941 the harbor defenses were commanded by Major General George F. Moore, whose Philippine Coast Artillery Command was headquartered at Fort Mills, on Corregidor. At this time there were 4,967 troops assigned to the Harbor Defenses.

The major units under the harbor defense command in World War II included:
* 59th Coast Artillery (Harbor Defense) (U.S. Regular Army)
* 91st Coast Artillery (HD) (Philippine Scouts)
* 92nd Coast Artillery (Tractor Drawn) (Philippine Scouts)
* 60th Coast Artillery AA (U.S. Regular Army)
* 1st Coast Artillery (Philippine Army)
* 2nd Coast Artillery (Philippine Army)

Other antiaircraft units in the Philippines included:
* 200th Coast Artillery AA (New Mexico National Guard) (arrived September 1941)
* 515th Coast Artillery AA (New Mexico National Guard, Philippine Army) (organized December 1941 from the 200th CA AA and Philippine Army)

===Antiaircraft units===
Chief of Coast Artillery Major General Joseph A. Green had recommended reassigning elements of the Harbor Defenses to anti-aircraft duty, but this proposal was rejected. However, a few harbor defense batteries manned AA batteries in the campaign. Most of the AA batteries at the harbor forts were manned by the 60th Coast Artillery (AA). The War Department had been intending to send three additional AA regiments and two brigade headquarters, however only one was sent before the Japanese invasion in December 1941. This was the 200th Coast Artillery (AA), which arrived in September 1941 and initially defended Fort Stotsenburg and Clark Field. The 515th Coast Artillery (AA) was formed in December 1941 using stored AA weapons and troops detached from the 200th, soon augmented by Philippine Army personnel. The regiment initially defended Manila. However, after Manila was declared an open city on 26 December, the 200th and 515th screened the withdrawal to Bataan and fought in the Battle of Bataan. When US forces in Bataan surrendered on 9 April 1942, these units were forced to join the Bataan Death March. With the exception of those areas covered by the 60th, 200th, and 515th CA AA regiments, the Philippine islands were virtually defenseless against air attack.

===The siege begins===

The Japanese invaded northern Luzon a few days after the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 that brought the US into the war. They advanced rapidly, with other landings elsewhere, notably at Legazpi in southeast Luzon on 12 December, Davao on Mindanao on 20 December, and Lingayen Gulf on 22 December. On 26 December 1941 Manila was declared an open city, with the Philippine government and MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters evacuated to the Malinta Tunnel. Amid the evacuations, a re-inauguration ceremony for Philippine President Manuel Quezon&#x27;s second term was held just outside the tunnel on 30 December. The Japanese entered Manila on 2 January 1942. Five days later the US and Philippine forces completed a fighting withdrawal to the Bataan peninsula, northwest of Corregidor, and prepared to defend it. All forces were withdrawn from Fort Wint and the Subic Bay area as part of this, reportedly due to a mistake by the commander of the Northern Luzon Force. A part of this withdrawal was the shipment of six 155 mm (6.1 in) GPF guns from the quartermaster depot at Los Baños (southeast of Manila) to Bataan; the field artillery units had few guns and these were a welcome addition. In the northern Philippines, this left only Bataan, Corregidor, and Forts Hughes, Frank, and Drum in Allied hands. This situation had been anticipated in the prewar War Plan Orange-3, under which the forces in the Philippines were expected to hold out at the mouth of Manila Bay for six months. By that time it was anticipated that a relief expedition from the US might arrive. General MacArthur had hoped to defend the Philippines more aggressively under the Rainbow Plan, and was able to get some reinforcements in the months prior to the U.S. entering the war, but this fell apart with the rapid Japanese advance in December 1941. With almost all of the US Pacific Fleet&#x27;s battleships sunk or damaged at Pearl Harbor, and the Japanese advancing in several parts of Southeast Asia at a much greater rate than expected, no relief was organized. Although extensive guerrilla operations were conducted by Filipinos with US support, US forces did not return to the Philippines in strength until the invasion of Leyte Gulf in October 1944.

On 3 February 1942 arrived at Corregidor with 3,500 rounds of 3-inch anti-aircraft ammunition. Along with mail and important documents, &quot;Trout&quot; was loaded with 20 tons of gold and silver previously removed from banks in the Philippines before departing.

One aspect of MacArthur&#x27;s Rainbow Plan was the Inland Seas Project, intended to defend a shipping route to keep his forces supplied. Part of this was a buildup of Philippine Commonwealth forces, and a projected deployment of coast artillery weapons manned by them in the central Philippines. In 1940-41 eight railway guns and 24 GPF guns were delivered to the Philippines, without crews as they were to be locally manned. The 8-inch guns were sent north in December 1941 to engage the invading Japanese forces, but six of them were destroyed by air attack. One gun was eventually placed on a fixed mount as Battery RJ-43 on Corregidor in March 1942; the other may have been at Bagac, Bataan. Reportedly the Corregidor gun fired only five proof rounds, then went unused for lack of a crew until knocked off its mount by bombing or shelling. The history of the Bataan gun is unknown. Most or all of the 24 155 mm GPF guns were eventually deployed at Corregidor and/or Bataan.

===Fall of Bataan===
Although the US and Filipino forces achieved success in defending Bataan through the end of February, they had taken 50 percent casualties and were worn out and poorly supplied. Also, the British fortress of Singapore had surrendered on 15 February, and the Japanese had taken several major islands of the Dutch East Indies, essentially preventing any reinforcement of the Philippines. Philippine President Manuel Quezon, with his family and senior officials, was evacuated to the southern Philippines by the submarine on 20 February. MacArthur was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to relocate to Australia to prevent his capture and to direct further operations. He departed Corregidor on 12 March 1942, initially by PT boat to Mindanao, completing his journey by air. On 20 March he made a speech with the famous phrase &quot;I shall return&quot;. He left Lieutenant General Jonathan M. Wainwright IV in a subordinate command in the Philippines, telling the key officers there that he (MacArthur) would control the military forces in the Philippines from Australia. However, he neglected to inform Washington of this arrangement, and Washington intended Wainwright to be in charge. It was not until 20 March that the extent of Wainwright&#x27;s authority and degree of independence from MacArthur was clarified by a message from General George C. Marshall, the Army chief of staff.

The Japanese in Bataan received substantial reinforcements and replacements in March, including 240 mm howitzers and aircraft, and prepared for an offensive scheduled for 3 April. It started with a five-hour air and artillery bombardment that destroyed many of the Allied defensive positions and stunned the defenders; a three-day assault threw them back along much of the line. On 6 April the US and Filipino forces attempted a counterattack, which ran into a fresh Japanese attack that eventually threw the Allies further back. Over the next two days many Allied units disintegrated, and on 9 April the Allied forces in Bataan surrendered. About 2,000 stragglers made it to Corregidor, while about 78,000 became prisoners of the Japanese and were transferred to camps in northern Luzon on the Bataan Death March.

===Fall of Corregidor===

Corregidor had been bombed intermittently since 29 December 1941. Supplies on the island were short, with food and water severely rationed and the defenders correspondingly weakened. Japanese artillery bombardment of Corregidor began immediately after the fall of Bataan on 9 April. It became intense over the next few weeks as more guns were brought up, and one day&#x27;s shelling was said to equal all the bombing raids combined in damage inflicted. However, after an initial response from a 155 mm GPF battery, Lt. Gen. Wainwright prohibited counter-battery fire for three days, fearing there were wounded POWs on Bataan who might be killed. Japanese aircraft flew 614 missions, dropping 1,701 bombs totaling some 365 tons of explosive. Joining the aerial bombardment were nine howitzers, thirty-four howitzers, and 32 other artillery pieces, which pounded Corregidor day and night. It was estimated that on 4 May alone, more than 16,000 shells hit Corregidor. Forts Frank and Drum had been bombarded from the Pico de Loro hills on the Cavite province shore since 6 February by a gradually increasing Japanese artillery force.

The bombardment by high-angle artillery and aircraft gradually destroyed the utility of almost all of Corregidor&#x27;s big guns, which had no overhead protection except for magazines and generators. The mortars of Battery Geary and Battery Way fared better until near the end; their battery arrangement did not require electric power for ammunition hoists. However, Battery Way at least had been out of service for years; only three mortars were restored to service and these not until 28 April, and by 5 May two of these were out of action. There was also a shortage of high explosive shells, and adapting the armor piercing shells for instantaneous detonation was time-consuming at only 25 shells per day. On 2 May a 240 mm shell penetrated one of Battery Geary&#x27;s magazines; the resulting explosion put the entire battery out of action, blowing one mortar from the battery and embedding another mortar entirely inside another magazine. Among the harbor forts, only Fort Drum&#x27;s turrets proved impregnable to attack; they remained in action until the surrender despite damage to other parts of the fort.

On the night of 4 May a submarine returning to Australia from patrol evacuated 25 persons. Among the passengers were Colonel Constant Irwin, who carried a complete roster of all Army, Navy, and Marine personnel still alive; Col. Royal G. Jenks, a finance officer, with financial accounts; Col. Milton A. Hill, the inspector general, 3 other Army and 6 Navy officers, and about 13 nurses. Included in the cargo sent from Corregidor were several bags of mail, the last to go out of the Philippines, and &quot;many USAFFE and USFIP records and orders&quot;.

The bombardment increased in intensity through 5 May, and the Japanese landed that night. Their initial landing was near the east end of the island, north of Kindley Field, the airstrip. This was somewhat east of their objective, which was between Infantry Point and Cavalry Point, due to a miscalculation of the current. The 4th Marine Regiment coordinated the ground forces, which included many soldiers and sailors from support units untrained in ground combat, many of them escapees from Bataan. Several coast artillery and antiaircraft batteries were abandoned to free their crews as ground forces. Of 229 officers and 3,770 enlisted men attached to the regiment, only around 1,500 were US Marines. The Japanese landed on the night of 5 May about 2300, with 75 mm and 37 mm guns deployed for beach defense reportedly causing them heavy casualties. At least three of the 155 mm guns were also still in action. However, by 0130 the Japanese captured Battery Denver, turning back three Allied counterattacks by 0400. At dawn, around 0440, more invasion barges were spotted and fire support from Fort Drum&#x27;s 14-inch (356 mm) guns was requested. Although smoke obscured the barges, Fort Drum was directed to fire &quot;anywhere between you and Cabcaben&quot; (in Bataan), and over 100 rounds were fired on the invasion route. By 1000 the Japanese were firmly lodged on the island. With 600-800 Allied troops killed and over 1,000 wounded, no reserves were left. No one was available to evacuate the wounded, and most of those who attempted to walk to the Malinta Tunnel were either further wounded or killed. General Wainwright felt certain that further Japanese troops would land in the night and seize the Malinta Tunnel, where they might massacre the wounded and noncombatants. He decided to sacrifice one day of freedom to save several thousand lives. After giving orders to his forces to destroy their weapons to prevent their use by the enemy, he surrendered.

The units in the south were in much better positions for both supplies and continued resistance than those at Bataan or Corregidor were, and their commanders believed Wainwright&#x27;s surrender orders were made under duress. It was not until 9 June that the Japanese accepted that all of the islands had surrendered. Some units never did surrender, and became nuclei for guerrilla operations that continued until the Japanese were mostly killed or captured in early 1945, following MacArthur&#x27;s return to the Philippines in force in October 1944.

The conquest of the Philippines by Japan is often considered the worst military defeat in United States history. About 23,000 American military personnel were killed or captured, while Filipino soldiers killed or captured totaled around 100,000.

The Philippines, Burma, and the Dutch East Indies were the last major territories the Japanese invaded in World War II. As Corregidor surrendered, the Battle of the Coral Sea was in progress, turning back a Japanese attempt to seize Port Moresby, New Guinea by sea. By the final surrender on 9 June, the Battle of Midway was over, blunting Japan&#x27;s naval strength with the loss of four large aircraft carriers and hundreds of skilled pilots. Both of these victories were costly to the US Navy as well, with two aircraft carriers lost, but the United States could replace their ships and train more pilots, and Japan, for the most part, could not do so adequately.

===Recapturing the forts===


US forces returned to the Philippines in a major invasion at Leyte beginning on 20 October 1944. The Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the invasion fleet on 23–26 October in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle of the war, but were repulsed with heavy losses. In December 1944 an empty Fort Wint was reclaimed &quot;without firing a shot&quot;. By early February 1945 much of the Manila area and part of Bataan had been secured. Corregidor was the biggest obstacle to reopening Manila Bay to shipping. A risky operation to recapture the island via near-simultaneous airborne and amphibious assault was devised. The invasion was set for 16 February and was preceded by air and naval bombardment. The airborne assault was to take place on Topside, the high ground in the west of the island. Only two small drop zones, the parade ground and the former golf course, were available. The overall plan was for the first airborne assault at 0830, the amphibious landing at 1030, and a second airborne lift at 1215. The airborne force was the 503rd Parachute Regimental Combat Team of Lieutenant Colonel George M. Jones, with a parachute field artillery battalion included. The amphibious assault was by the reinforced 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division.

The airborne assault began on schedule at 0833 on 16 February 1945. It achieved surprise and Japanese resistance was light. However, a higher drop altitude and stronger winds than planned, combined with the small drop zones, resulted in a 25 percent injury rate. Many troops landed outside the drop zones in wooded or rocky areas, or on ruined buildings and gun batteries. One group of paratroopers landed on an observation post that included the Japanese commander, and killed him. The amphibious assault at 1030 on the south shore of Bottomside at San Jose was also successful, despite encountering land mines. The surface of Malinta Hill was captured in half an hour, although numerous Japanese remained in the Malinta Tunnel below it. The second paratroop lift dropped at 1240, with a much lower injury rate than the first lift. The combined forces on Corregidor became known as &quot;Rock Force&quot;.

As well as the force in the Malinta Tunnel, the Japanese were dug in on various parts of the island, occupying numerous tunnels and small bunkers. Rock Force cleared the bunkers in the typical fashion of the war in the Pacific: air-delivered napalm bombs where needed, followed by assaults with flamethrowers and white phosphorus grenades among other weapons. The Japanese would sometimes reoccupy these positions at night. In some cases demolition charges were used to entomb the Japanese in their bunkers and tunnels. The Japanese occasionally made banzai charges at this point in the war, which mainly succeeded in increasing their own casualties. There were attempts made to persuade the Japanese to surrender, but few did so. On at least three occasions the Japanese were able to detonate ammunition caches near American troops, usually followed by an attack, though these tactics killed more Japanese than Americans. The most spectacular of these was the detonation of a large amount of explosives in the Malinta Tunnel on the night of 21 February. Apparently the intention was to shock the Americans on and near Malinta Hill and allow the force in the tunnel to escape eastward to the island&#x27;s tail. However, it appeared that the explosion was larger than intended, though perhaps several hundred Japanese out of an estimated 2,000 in the tunnel were able to join their main force on the tail. Two nights later more explosions shook Malinta Hill, probably the suicide of its remaining defenders. By this time the entire western part of the island was cleared and preparations made to clear the tail area. On 24 February the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry was relieved by the 2nd Battalion, 151st Infantry of the 38th Infantry Division. At 1100 on 26 February the Japanese apparently decided to finish themselves and take some Americans with them, setting off an ammunition-filled bunker at Monkey Point. Perhaps 200 Japanese were killed outright, along with 50 Americans killed and 150 wounded. Within a few hours the only Japanese left alive were in caves along the island&#x27;s waterline, who were mopped up in a few days. Corregidor was formally reclaimed with a flag-raising on 2 March, attended by General MacArthur.

The remaining forts were reclaimed from late March through mid-April. The first was Fort Hughes, on Caballo Island southeast of Corregidor. The reinforced 2nd Battalion, 151st Infantry, veterans of the final days of the Corregidor assault, reclaimed Fort Hughes, and later Company F and an engineer detachment of the 113th (both of the 38th Infantry Division) retook Fort Drum. The attack on Fort Hughes began on 27 March 1945. The landing force amphibiously assaulted the island, following a brief but intense air and naval bombardment. The Japanese had prepared positions around the batteries and were able to shelter in the tunnels. Initial assaults were unsuccessful; the terrain was such that tanks could not bring their guns to bear on the Japanese positions. On 31 March an attempt was made to burn out the defenders by pouring diesel fuel down the only vent shaft accessible to the Americans. However, this did not work, as the diesel fuel could not be delivered up the sides of the battery fast enough. The commander of the 113th Engineer Combat Battalion devised a solution using two diesel-filled ponton cubes from the naval forces and a pump and flex hose from the air forces. On 5 April over of diesel fuel were pumped down the vent shaft and ignited using white phosphorus mortar rounds. This was repeated twice more on 6 and 7 April, followed by two demolition charges. The next few days were occupied with probing infantry attacks and attempts to persuade the surviving Japanese to surrender. On 13 April the last defender was killed and the fort was reclaimed.

Fort Drum was reclaimed in a similar manner on 13 April 1945, using a Landing Ship Medium (LSM) modified with a bridge to allow troops to run from the ship onto the fort&#x27;s top deck. Company F of the 151st Infantry and a detachment of the 113th Engineer Combat Battalion took part. Over of fuel were pumped into the fort via a Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM), along with demolition charges totaling 600 pounds of TNT. The initial explosion was weak, but ten minutes later burning fuel apparently ignited an ammunition magazine, and the fort blew up. Secondary explosions and heat from the fires prevented entry into the fort until 18 April. 69 dead Japanese were counted.

Fort Frank on Carabao Island was assaulted on 16 April by the 1st Battalion of the 151st Infantry and Co. C of the 113th Engineer Combat Battalion. However, the Japanese had escaped to the mainland.
