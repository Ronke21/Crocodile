<text>Celia Caridad Cruz Alfonso (21 October 1925 – 16 July 2003), known as Celia Cruz, was a Cuban singer and one of the most popular Latin artists of the 20th century. Cruz rose to fame in Cuba during the 1950s as a singer of , earning the nickname &quot;&quot;. In the following decades, she became known internationally as the &quot;[[Celia Cruz|Queen of Salsa]]&quot; due to her contributions to Latin music. She had sold over 10 million records, making her one of the best-selling Latin music artists.

The artist began her career in her home country Cuba, earning recognition as a vocalist of the popular musical group Sonora Matancera, a musical association that lasted 15 years (1950–1965). Cruz mastered a wide variety of Afro-Cuban music styles including , rumba, afro, and bolero, recording numerous singles in these styles for Seeco Records. In 1960, after the Cuban Revolution caused the nationalization of the music industry, Cruz left her native country, becoming one of the symbols and spokespersons of the Cuban community in exile. Cruz continued her career, first in Mexico, and then in the United States, the country that she took as her definitive residence. In the 1960s, she collaborated with Tito Puente, recording her signature tune &quot;&quot;. In the 1970s, she signed for Fania Records and became strongly associated with the salsa genre, releasing hits such as &quot;Quimbara&quot;. She often appeared live with Fania All-Stars and collaborated with Johnny Pacheco and Willie Colón. During the last years of her career, Cruz continued to release successful songs such as &quot; and &quot;.

Her musical legacy is made up of a total of 37 studio albums, as well as numerous live albums and collaborations. Throughout her career, she was awarded numerous prizes and distinctions, including two Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards. In addition to her prolific career in music, Cruz also made several appearances as an actress in movies and telenovelas. Her catchphrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sugar!&quot;) has become one of the most recognizable symbols of salsa music.

== Early life ==
Celia Caridad Cruz Alfonso was born on 21 October 1925, at 47 Serrano Street in the Santos Suárez neighborhood of Havana, Cuba. Her father, Simón Cruz, was a railway stoker, and her mother, Catalina Alfonso Ramos, a housewife who took care of an extended family. Celia was one of the eldest among fourteen children living in the house, including cousins and her three siblings, Dolores, Gladys, and Bárbaro, and she used to sing cradle songs to put them to sleep. According to her mother, she began singing as a child at 9 or 10 months of age, often in the middle of the night. She also sang in school during the Fridays&#x27; and in her neighborhood ensemble, Botón de oro.

While growing up in Cuba&#x27;s diverse 1930s musical climate, Cruz listened to many musicians who influenced her adult career, including Fernando Collazo, Abelardo Barroso, Pablo Quevedo, Antonio Arcaño and Arsenio Rodríguez. Despite her father&#x27;s opposition and the fact that she was Catholic, as a child Cruz learned Santería songs from her neighbor who practiced Santería. Cruz also studied the words to Yoruba songs with colleague Merceditas Valdés (an &quot;akpwon&quot;, a Santería singer) from Cuba and later made various recordings of this religious genre, even singing backup for other akpwons like Candita Batista.

As a teenager, her aunt took her and her cousin to cabarets to sing, but her father encouraged her to attend school in the hope she would become a teacher. After high school, she attended the Normal School for Teachers in Havana with the intent of becoming a literature teacher. At the time being a singer was not viewed as an entirely respectable career. However, one of her teachers told her that, as an entertainer, she could earn in one day what most Cuban teachers earned in a month. From 1947, Cruz studied music theory, voice, and piano at Havana&#x27;s National Conservatory of Music.

One day, her cousin took her to Havana&#x27;s radio station Radio García-Serra, where she became a contestant in the &quot;Hora del té&quot; amateur radio program. It was her first time using a microphone and she sang the tango &quot;Nostalgia&quot; (as a tribute to Paulina Álvarez), winning a cake as the first prize for her performance. On other occasions she won silver chains, as well as opportunities to participate in more contests. She also sang in other amateur radio programs such as , broadcast by CMQ, always winning first prize. The only exception was when she competed against Vilma Valle, having to split their earnings: 25 dollars each.

In 2004, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; revealed from partially declassified US State Department papers that Cruz had been linked to Cuba&#x27;s pre-Revolution communist party, the Popular Socialist Party (PSP), as early as the 1940s. The article, promoted as an &quot;exclusive&quot;, was written by Miami Herald journalist Carol Rosenberg from Freedom of Information Act requests. It made several revelations. Among them, the US Embassy in Havana denied Cruz a US visa in 1952 and 1955 because of suspected communist affiliations. The article also states that Cruz had joined the youth wing of the PSP at age 20 and had used a concert to arrange a secret meeting with communists in South America on behalf of its then general secretary, Blas Roca Calderío, who has also founded the party in 1925. Cruz had also signed a public letter in support of one of the Party&#x27;s front groups, the Pro-Peace Congress. The article states that Cruz&#x27;s surviving husband, Pedro Knight, was asked about this, and is quoted he knew nothing about it. &quot;She never told me about that. She never talked about politics,&quot; the article quotes Knight.

== Career ==
=== First recordings ===
Isolina Carrillo was one of the first people to recognize Cruz&#x27;s ability to sing Afro-Cuban music and asked her to join her Conjunto Siboney, where Olga Guillot also sang. She later joined Orquesta de Ernesto Duarte, Gloria Matancera, Sonora Caracas and Orquesta Anacaona. From 1947, she started to sing in Havana&#x27;s most popular cabarets: Tropicana, Sans Souci, Bamboo, Topeka, etc. In 1948, Roderico &quot;Rodney&quot; Neyra founded the group of dancers and singers Las Mulatas de Fuego (The Fiery Mulattas). Cruz was hired with this group as a singer, reaching great success and making presentations in Mexico and Venezuela, where she made her first recordings. Shortly thereafter, Cruz began to sing on musical programs at Radio Cadena Suaritos, along with a group that performed Santería music under the direction of Obdulio Morales. With this group, known as Coro Yoruba y Tambores Batá, she made several recordings that were later released by Panart.

=== Sonora Matancera ===
Cruz&#x27;s big break came in 1950 when Myrta Silva, the singer with Cuba&#x27;s Sonora Matancera, returned to her native Puerto Rico. Since they were in need of a new singer, the band decided to give the young Celia Cruz a chance. She auditioned in June, and at the end of July she was asked to join as lead singer, and thus became the group&#x27;s first black frontwoman. In her first rehearsal with Sonora Matancera, Cruz met her future husband Pedro Knight, who was the band&#x27;s second trumpeter.

Cruz debuted with the group on 3 August 1950. Initially, Cruz was not received with enthusiasm by the public, but Rogelio Martínez had faith in her. On 15 December 1950, Cruz recorded her first songs with the group, which were a resounding success. Her &quot;musical marriage&quot; with the Sonora Matancera lasted fifteen years. In total Celia recorded 188 songs with the Matancera, including hits such as &quot;Cao cao maní picao&quot;, &quot;Mata siguaraya&quot;, &quot;Burundanga&quot; and &quot;El yerbero moderno&quot;. She won her first gold record for &quot;Burundanga&quot;, making her first trip to the United States in 1957 to receive the award and to perform at St. Nicholas Arena, New York. During her 15 years with Sonora Matancera, she appeared in cameos in some Mexican films such as (1950), (1955) and (1961), toured all over Latin America and became a regular at the Tropicana.

=== Exile and Tico recordings ===
Cruz was touring in Mexico when Fidel Castro seized power at the conclusion of the Cuban Revolution. She returned to Cuba to find her hometown of Havana in turmoil and mostly shut down. Cruz was publicly critical of Castro, a stance that she knew would endanger her career and possibly her freedom, since other critics of the regime were regularly arrested. She also needed money to pay for her ailing mother&#x27;s medical expenses, and when she was offered a contract to perform for a few months at La Terraza Nightclub in Mexico City, she accepted. Cruz left Cuba on 15 July 1960, not knowing that she would likely never return to her home country.

Just one week after arriving in Mexico, Cruz received the news of the death of her father, Simón Cruz. In 1961, Cruz and Sonora Matancera left Mexico for an engagement in the United States. During this period, Cruz began performing solo without the group, performing at a recital at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles.

In 1962, before the refusal of the Cuban government to allow her to return to Cuba, Cruz acquired a house in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Although she tried to return to Cuba to see her sick mother, who was struggling with terminal bladder cancer, the Cuban government denied her request to return. On 7 April 1962, she received the news of the death of her mother Catalina Alfonso. That same year, on 14 July, Cruz was married in civil ceremony with Pedro Knight after a romance of several years. Cruz and Sonora Matancera made their first tour outside of the Americas, visiting Europe and Japan, where they performed with Tito Puente. In 1965, Cruz would culminate a vertiginous fifteen years with the Sonora Matancera. Cruz began a solo career and her husband Pedro Knight decided to leave his position at Sonora Matancera to become her representative, arranger and personal director. During this time, Cruz became an American citizen.

In 1966, Cruz was contacted by Tito Puente to perform with his orchestra. Their first collaborative album, featured a recording of José Claro Fumero&#x27;s guaracha &quot;Bemba colorá&quot;, which became one of Cruz&#x27;s signature songs. Cruz and Puente went on to collaborate on another four albums together. She also recorded albums with other musical directors such as Memo Salamanca, Juan Bruno Tarraza and Lino Frías for Tico Records. In 1974, Fania Records, the leading salsa record label, acquired Tico and signed Cruz to the imprint Vaya Records, where she remained until 1992.

=== The Fania years ===

Cruz&#x27;s association with the Fania label had begun in 1973, when she recorded the lead vocals of &quot;Gracia divina&quot;, a song by Larry Harlow which was part of his &quot;Latin opera&quot; &quot;Hommy&quot;. She then joined the Fania All-Stars, a salsa supergroup featuring the most popular performers of the Fania roster. With them, Cruz first sang &quot;Bemba colorá&quot; and &quot;Diosa del ritmo&quot; in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1973. She later travelled with the group to Kinshasa, Zaire, in 1974 and returned to San Juan in 1975 for another concert. These live recordings were commercially released years later. Her performance in Zaire, as part of The Rumble in the Jungle event, was included in the film &quot;Soul Power&quot;.

Cruz recorded her first studio album for Fania in 1974 in collaboration with Johnny Pacheco, the label&#x27;s founder and musical director. The album, &quot;Celia &amp; Johnny&quot;, and its lead single, &quot;Quimbara&quot;, were both a commercial success. In 1976, she participated in the documentary film &quot;Salsa&quot; about Latin culture, along with figures like Dolores del Río and Willie Colón. The following year she recorded her first LP with Colón, a collaboration that would be repeated with great success in 1981 and 1987. When touring with Colón, Cruz wore a flamboyant costume, which included various colored wigs, tight sequined dresses, and very high heels. Her fashion style became so famous that one of them was acquired by the Smithsonian institution. In the late 1970s, she participated in an Eastern Air Lines commercial in Puerto Rico, singing the catchy phrase (&quot;This is to truly fly!&quot;). Cruz also used to sing the identifying spot for WQBA radio station in Miami, formerly known as &quot;La Cubanísima&quot;: &quot;I am the voice of Cuba, from this land, far away...I am liberty, I am WQBA, the most Cuban!&quot; ().

In 1982, Celia was reunited with the Sonora Matancera and recorded the album . That year, the singer received the first tribute of her career at Madison Square Garden in New York. In 1987, Cruz performed a concert in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. That concert was recognized by the publisher of the Guinness Book of Records as the largest free-entry outdoor concert, with an audience of 250,000 people. In 1988, she participated in the feature film &quot;Salsa&quot; alongside Robby Draco Rosa. In 1990, Cruz won her first Grammy Award (Best Tropical Latin Performance) for her album , recorded with Ray Barretto. She was also invited to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the Sonora Matancera in Central Park in New York. The decline of Fania&#x27;s brand of in favor of the emergent gradually brought an end to Celia&#x27;s musical association with the Fania All Stars. Their final reunions took place in Puerto Rico (1994) and Colombia (1995), both of which were released on CD.

===Later years===

In 1990, Cruz managed to return to Cuba. She was invited to make a presentation at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. When she came out of this presentation she took a few grams of Cuban soil in a bag; at her request, this bag would later be placed in her coffin when she died. In 1994, she received the National Endowment for the Arts award from the then President Bill Clinton, which is the highest recognition granted by the United States government to an artist.
Having made musical presentations in Mexican and Cuban films, in 1992 Celia participated as an actress in the American film &quot;Mambo Kings&quot;, along with Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas. A year later she made her debut as a television actress in the Mexican telenovela &quot;Valentina&quot;, along with Verónica Castro for the Televisa network. In 1995, Celia made a guest appearance in the American film &quot;The Perez Family&quot;, along with Alfred Molina and Anjelica Huston. In 1997, she starred again for Televisa in the Mexican telenovela , a remake of the classic Mexican film &quot;Angelitos negros&quot;. Cruz played the role of a black woman who gives birth to a white daughter. On 25 October 1997, the city of San Francisco, California, officially declared that date as &quot;Celia Cruz Day&quot;.

In 1998, she released the album , which featured one of her most successful songs, . In 1999, she performed with Luciano Pavarotti for the &quot;Pavarotti and Friends&quot; concert. In 2000, Cruz released a new album under the auspices of Sony Music, &quot;Celia Cruz and Friends: A Night of Salsa&quot;, where she recorded again with Tito Puente, who died shortly after. Thanks to this album, Cruz was awarded her first Latin Grammy. In 2001, the album won her a second Latin Grammy. In that same year, she performed with Marc Anthony in a tribute to Aretha Franklin for VH1. In 2002, Cruz released the album, , where she ventured into modern variants of Caribbean rhythms, influenced by rap and hip hop. For this record she won her third Latin Grammy and her second American Grammy.

On 16 July 2002, Cruz performed to a full house at the free outdoor performing arts festival Central Park SummerStage in New York City. During the performance she sang &quot;&quot;. A live recording of this song was subsequently made available in 2005 on a commemorative CD honoring the festival&#x27;s then 20-year history entitled, &quot;Central Park SummerStage: Live from the Heart of the City&quot;. Cruz appeared on the Dionne Warwick albums &quot;Dionne Sings Dionne&quot; and &quot;My Friends &amp; Me&quot; with their Latin duet version of &quot;(Do You Know The Way To) San José&quot;.

== Death ==

In August and September 2002, Cruz underwent surgery due to breast cancer. In November that year, Cruz fell during a concert in Mexico. She was diagnosed with glioma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, and underwent surgery in December. Confident, Cruz said she did not shed one tear and that she was aiming to resume her artistic career. She finished recording her last album, . In February, she appeared in public again at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards to receive the award for Best Salsa Album. In March 2003, the US Hispanic network Telemundo paid tribute to her.

On the afternoon of 16 July 2003, Cruz died at her home in Fort Lee, New Jersey, at the age of 77. At her express wish, her mortal remains were first transferred to Miami for two days to receive the homage of her Cuban exile admirers at Gesu Church, before a funeral Mass at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and burial in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York. An epilogue in her autobiography notes that, in accordance with her wishes, Cuban soil - which she had saved from a visit to Guantánamo Bay - was used in her entombment.

<text>Blind Harry ( 1440 – 1492), also known as Harry, Hary or Henry the Minstrel, is renowned as the author of &quot;The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;The Wallace&quot;. This is a lengthy poem recounting the life of William Wallace, the Scottish independence leader, written around 1477, 172 years after Wallace&#x27;s death.

==Biography==
Little is known about Blind Harry&#x27;s life. One source is the Lord High Treasurer&#x27;s accounts of 1473–1492, which recorded payments to him for performances at the court of James IV. Blind Harry was given gifts of money by the King at New Year, as were other minor courtiers, but a payment on 2 January 1492 seems to relate to the singing of a ballad accompanied by two Gaelic harpers, &quot;Ersche clareschaw&quot;, mentioned in adjacent entries. This is the last mention of Harry in the accounts.

He is mentioned by William Dunbar on line 69 of his &quot;Lament for the Makeris&quot; early in the 16th century. Historian John Major also wrote about Harry in 1518. These sources differed on whether or not he was blind from birth, but Harry almost certainly seems to have had a military background.

==&quot;Acts and Deeds&quot;==
===Sources===
Blind Harry claimed his work was based on a book by Father John Blair, Wallace&#x27;s boyhood friend and personal chaplain. This book has not been seen in modern times and may never have existed; the poet&#x27;s attribution of his story to a written text may have been a literary device; many contemporary critics believe that &quot;Acts and Deeds&quot; is based on oral history and the national traditions of Blind Harry&#x27;s homeland.

Most historians nowadays regard &quot;Acts and Deeds&quot; as a versified historical novel, written at a time of strong anti-English sentiment in Scotland. At twelve volumes, the work is also doubted to be solely his work. Elspeth King maintained that despite any inaccuracies, Harry&#x27;s patriotic and nationalistic portrayal was to ensure Wallace&#x27;s continuing reputation as a hero. Robert Burns acknowledged his debt to Harry, paraphrasing the following lines from Harry&#x27;s &quot;Wallace&quot; in his own poem Robert Bruce&#x27;s Address to his Army at Bannockburn (Scots, wha hae wi&#x27; Wallace bled):
A false usurper sinks in every foe
And liberty returns with every blow
which Burns described as &quot;a couplet worthy of Homer&quot;.

The earliest version of the work is found in a manuscript written in 1488 by John Ramsay, the purported scribe of John Barbour&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Brus&quot;. The manuscript is found at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh.

===Criticism===
Harry&#x27;s depiction of Wallace has been criticised by Major and others as being fictionalized. Some parts of it are at variance with contemporary sources, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the work describes Wallace leading an army to the outskirts of London, and it includes some episodes of doubtful accuracy before Wallace enters history with the action at Lanark. It also describes him adopting the disguises of a monk, an old woman, and a potter while a fugitive, and travelling to France to enlist support for the Scottish cause, there defeating two French champions, as well as a lion. &quot;Are there any more dogs you would have slain?&quot;, Wallace asks the French king.

Harry is often considered inferior to Barbour as a poet, and has little of his moral elevation, but he surpasses him in graphic power, vividness of description, and variety of incident. He occasionally shows the influence of Chaucer, and is said to have known Latin and French.

Blind Harry&#x27;s words were made more accessible by a translation written by William Hamilton of Gilbertfield (c. 1665–1751) published in 1722. In this form they met the notice of poets such as Robert Burns, Lord Byron, Robert Southey, John Keats, Joanna Baillie, and William Wordsworth. It was also an important source for Randall Wallace in his writing of the screenplay of &quot;Braveheart&quot;, the award-winning Hollywood film. Most recently, in 1998, Elspeth King published Hamilton&#x27;s text amended for modern readers as &quot;Blind Harry&#x27;s Wallace&quot;.

===Wallace folklore===
Blind Harry mentions a number of battles or skirmishes fought by Wallace which are now regarded by historians as unhistorical. These battles are sometimes referenced as historical events by accounts which do not cross-check the stories in &quot;Acts and Deeds&quot; against another source. Dubious battles include the &quot;Battle of Loudoun Hill&quot; in 1296, the &quot;Battle of Biggar&quot; in 1297, and possibly also the &quot;Battle of Elcho Park&quot;. In the case of the folkloric Battle of Loudoun Hill, later enthusiasts have erected a monument to Wallace at the site. (The folkloric battle should not be confused with the genuine Battle of Loudoun Hill fought by Robert the Bruce.) Similarly, the story of a mass hanging of Scots nobles at Ayr is described by Blind Harry, and is repeated in a number of places, including the film &quot;Braveheart&quot;, but is now regarded as unhistorical.

<doc id="166344" wikidata="Q159670" url="?curid=166344" title="Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale">
<text>Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (Albert Victor Christian Edward; 8 January 1864 – 14 January 1892) was the eldest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). From the time of his birth, he was second in the line of succession to the British throne, but did not become king or Prince of Wales because he died before both his father and paternal grandmother Queen Victoria.

Albert Victor was known to his family, and many later biographers, as &quot;Eddy&quot;. When he was young, he travelled the world extensively as a Royal Navy cadet, and as an adult, he joined the British Army, but did not undertake any active military duties. After two unsuccessful courtships, he became engaged to be married to his second cousin once removed Princess Victoria Mary of Teck in late 1891. A few weeks later, he died during a major pandemic. Mary later married his younger brother, the future King George V.

Albert Victor&#x27;s intellect, sexuality, and mental health have been the subject of speculation. Rumours in his time linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel. However, there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there, or that he was homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, or that he was otherwise involved in the murders, but contemporaneous documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.

==Early life==

Albert Victor was born two months prematurely on 8 January 1864 at Frogmore House, Windsor, Berkshire. He was the first child of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and his wife Alexandra of Denmark. Following his grandmother Queen Victoria&#x27;s wishes, he was named &quot;Albert Victor&quot; after the Queen and her late husband, Prince Albert. As a grandchild of the reigning British monarch in the male line and a son of the Prince of Wales, he was formally styled &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Albert Victor of Wales&quot; from birth. He was christened &quot;Albert Victor Christian Edward&quot; in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 10 March 1864 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Longley, but was known informally as &quot;Eddy&quot;.

=== Education ===

When Albert Victor was just short of seventeen months old, his brother, Prince George of Wales, was born in June 1865. Given their closeness in age, they were educated together. In 1871, the Queen appointed John Neale Dalton as their tutor. The two princes were given a strict programme of study, which included games and military drills as well as academic subjects. Dalton complained that Albert Victor&#x27;s mind was &quot;abnormally dormant&quot;.

Though Albert Victor learnt to speak his mother&#x27;s native Danish, progress in other languages and subjects was slow. Sir Henry Ponsonby thought that Albert Victor might have inherited his mother&#x27;s deafness. The prince never excelled intellectually. Possible physical explanations for his inattention or indolence in class include absence seizures or his premature birth, which can be associated with learning difficulties, but Lady Geraldine Somerset blamed Albert Victor&#x27;s poor education on Dalton, whom she considered uninspiring.

Separating the brothers for the remainder of their education was considered, but Dalton advised the Prince of Wales against splitting them up as &quot;Prince Albert Victor requires the stimulus of Prince George&#x27;s company to induce him to work at all.&quot; In 1877, the two boys were sent to the Royal Navy&#x27;s training ship, HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;. They began their studies there two months behind the other cadets as Albert Victor contracted typhoid fever, for which he was treated by Sir William Gull. Dalton accompanied them as chaplain to the ship.

In 1879, after a great deal of discussion between the Queen, the Prince of Wales, their households and the Government, the royal brothers were sent as naval cadets on a three-year world tour aboard HMS &quot;Bacchante&quot;. Albert Victor was rated midshipman on his sixteenth birthday. They toured the British Empire, accompanied by Dalton, visiting the Americas, the Falkland Islands, South Africa, Australia, Fiji, the Far East, Singapore, Ceylon, Aden, Egypt, the Holy Land and Greece. They acquired tattoos in Japan. By the time they returned to Britain, Albert Victor was eighteen.

The brothers were parted in 1883; George continued in the navy and Albert Victor attended Trinity College, Cambridge. At Bachelor&#x27;s Cottage, Sandringham, Albert Victor was expected to cram before arriving at university in the company of Dalton, French instructor Monsieur Hua, and a newly chosen tutor/companion, James Kenneth Stephen. Some biographers have said that Stephen was a misogynist, although this has recently been questioned, and he may have felt emotionally attached to Albert Victor, but whether or not his feelings were overtly homosexual is open to question. Stephen was initially optimistic about tutoring the prince, but by the time the party were to move to Cambridge had concluded, &quot;I do not think he can possibly derive much benefit from attending lectures at Cambridge ... He hardly knows the meaning of the words &quot;to read&quot;&quot;.

At the start of the new term in October, Albert Victor, Dalton, and Lieutenant Henderson from &quot;Bacchante&quot; moved to Nevile&#x27;s Court at Trinity College, which was generally reserved for accommodating dons rather than students. The prince showed little interest in the intellectual atmosphere, and he was excused from examinations, though he did become involved in undergraduate life. He was introduced to Oscar Browning, a noted don who gave parties and &quot;made pets of those undergraduates who were handsome and attractive&quot;, and became friendly with Dalton&#x27;s godson, Alfred Fripp, who later became his doctor and royal surgeon. It is not known whether he had any sexual experiences at Cambridge, but partners of either sex would have been available. In August 1884, he spent some time at Heidelberg University studying German, before returning to Cambridge. Leaving Cambridge in 1885, where he had already served as a cadet in the 2nd Cambridge University Battalion, he was gazetted as an officer in the 10th Hussars. In 1888, he was awarded an honorary degree by the university.

One of Albert Victor&#x27;s instructors said he learnt by listening rather than reading or writing and had no difficulty remembering information, but Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, had a less favourable opinion of him, calling him &quot;an inveterate and incurable dawdler&quot;. Princess Augusta of Cambridge was also dismissive, calling him: &quot;si peu de chose&quot; [such a small thing].

Much of Albert Victor&#x27;s time at his post in Aldershot was spent drilling, which he disliked, though he did like to play polo. He passed his examinations, and in March 1887, he was posted to Hounslow where he was promoted to captain. He was given more public engagements, visited Ireland and Gibraltar, and opened the Hammersmith suspension bridge. Of his private life, a childhood friend of Albert Victor later recalled that it was uneventful: &quot;his brother officers had said that they would like to make a man of the world of him. Into that world he refused to be initiated.&quot;

==Cleveland Street scandal==

In July 1889, the Metropolitan Police uncovered a male brothel operated by Charles Hammond in Cleveland Street, London. Under police interrogation, the male prostitutes and pimps revealed the names of their clients, who included Lord Arthur Somerset, an Extra Equerry to the Prince of Wales. At the time, all homosexual acts between men were illegal, and the clients faced social ostracism, prosecution and, at worst, two years&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour.

The resultant Cleveland Street scandal implicated other high-ranking figures in British society, and rumours swept upper-class London of the involvement of a member of the royal family, namely Prince Albert Victor. The prostitutes had not named Albert Victor, and it is suggested that Somerset&#x27;s solicitor, Arthur Newton, fabricated and spread the rumours to take the heat off his client. Letters exchanged between the Treasury Solicitor, Sir Augustus Stephenson, and his assistant, Hamilton Cuffe, make coded reference to Newton&#x27;s threats to implicate Albert Victor.

In December 1889, it was reported that the Prince and Princess of Wales were &quot;daily assailed with anonymous letters of the most outrageous character&quot; bearing upon the scandal. The Prince of Wales intervened in the investigation; no clients were ever prosecuted and nothing against Albert Victor was proven. Sir Charles Russell was retained to watch the proceedings in the case on behalf of Albert Victor. Although there is no conclusive evidence for or against his involvement, or that he ever visited a homosexual club or brothel, the rumours and cover-up have led some biographers to speculate that he did visit Cleveland Street, and that he was &quot;possibly bisexual, probably homosexual&quot;. This is contested by other commentators, one of whom refers to him as &quot;ardently heterosexual&quot; and his involvement in the rumours as &quot;somewhat unfair&quot;. Historian H. Montgomery Hyde wrote: &quot;There is no evidence that he was homosexual, or even bisexual.&quot;

While English newspapers suppressed mention of Albert Victor&#x27;s name in association with the case, Welsh-language, colonial, and American newspapers were less inhibited. The &quot;New York Times&quot; ridiculed him as a &quot;dullard&quot; and &quot;stupid perverse boy&quot;, who would &quot;never be allowed to ascend the British throne&quot;. According to one American press report, when departing the Gare du Nord in Paris in May 1890, Albert Victor was cheered by a waiting crowd of English, but hissed and catcalled by some of the French; one journalist present asked him if he would comment &quot;as to the cause of his sudden departure from England&quot;. According to the report, &quot;The Prince&#x27;s sallow face turned scarlet and his eyes seemed to start from their orbits,&quot; and he had one of his companions upbraid the fellow for impertinence.

Somerset&#x27;s sister, Lady Waterford, denied that her brother knew anything about Albert Victor. She wrote, &quot;I am sure the boy is as straight as a line ... Arthur does not the least know how or where the boy spends his time ... he believes the boy to be perfectly innocent.&quot; Lady Waterford also believed Somerset&#x27;s protestations of his own innocence. In surviving private letters to his friend Lord Esher, Somerset denies knowing anything directly about Albert Victor, but confirms that he has heard the rumours, and hopes that they will help quash any prosecution. He wrote,
I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son&#x27;s name being coupled with the thing but that was the case before I left it ... we were both accused of going to this place but not together ... they will end by having out in open court exactly what they are all trying to keep quiet. I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention of that arch ruffian H[ammond].
He continued,
I have never mentioned the boy&#x27;s name except to Probyn, Montagu and Knollys when they were acting for me and I thought they ought to know. Had they been wise, hearing what I knew and therefore what others knew, they ought to have hushed the matter up, instead of stirring it up as they did, with all the authorities.
The rumours persisted; sixty years later the official biographer of George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy at the time of the scandal, that Albert Victor &quot;had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated.&quot; In fact, none of the lawyers in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off during the scandal, but Somerset&#x27;s solicitor, Arthur Newton, was convicted of obstruction of justice for helping his clients escape abroad, and was sentenced to six weeks in prison. Over twenty years later in 1910, Newton was struck off for twelve months for professional misconduct after falsifying letters from another of his clients, the notorious murderer Dr Crippen. In 1913, Newton was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences.

==Tour of India==

The foreign press suggested that Albert Victor was sent on a seven-month tour of British India from October 1889 to avoid the gossip which swept London society in the wake of the scandal. Actually the trip had been planned since the spring. Travelling via Athens, Port Said, Cairo and Aden, Albert Victor arrived in Bombay on 9 November 1889. He was entertained sumptuously in Hyderabad by the Nizam, and elsewhere by many other maharajahs. In Bangalore he laid the foundation stone of the Glass House at the Lalbagh Botanical Gardens on 30 November 1889. He spent Christmas at Mandalay and the New Year at Calcutta. Most of the extensive travelling was done by train, although elephants were ridden as part of ceremonies. In the style of the time, a great many animals were shot for sport.

During the trip, Albert Victor met Mrs. Margery Haddon, the wife of a civil engineer, Henry Haddon. After several failed marriages and Albert Victor&#x27;s death, Margery came to England and claimed the Prince was the father of her son, Clarence Haddon. There was no evidence and her claims were dismissed. She had become an alcoholic and seemed deranged. The allegations were reported to Buckingham Palace and the head of the police Special Branch investigated. Papers in The National Archives show that neither courtiers nor Margery had any proof to support the allegation. In a statement to police, Albert Victor&#x27;s lawyers admitted that there had been &quot;some relations&quot; between him and Mrs. Haddon, but denied the claim of fatherhood.

In the 1920s, however, the son, Clarence, repeated the story and published a book in the United States, &quot;My Uncle George V&quot;, in which he claimed he was born in London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor&#x27;s meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon&#x27;s enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer&#x27;s commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not imprison him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor&#x27;s son. Haddon breached the conditions and was incarcerated for a year. Dismissed as a crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon&#x27;s claim had been true, as with other illegitimate births it would have made no difference to the royal line of succession.

On his return from India, Albert Victor was created Duke of Clarence and Avondale and Earl of Athlone on 24 May 1890, Queen Victoria&#x27;s 71st birthday.

==Potential brides==
In 1889, Queen Victoria expressed her wish that Albert Victor marry his cousin Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, who was one of her favorite granddaughters. In Balmoral Castle, he proposed to Alix, but she did not return his affections and refused his offer of engagement. He persisted in trying to convince Alix to marry him, but he finally gave up in 1890 when she sent him a letter in which she told him &quot;how it grieves her to pain him, but that she cannot marry him, much as she likes him as a Cousin.&quot; In 1894, she married Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, another of Albert Victor&#x27;s cousins.

After her proposed match with Alix fell through, the Queen suggested to Albert Victor that he marry another first cousin, Princess Margaret of Prussia. On 19 May 1890, she sent him a formal letter in which she expressed her opinions about Margaret&#x27;s suitability to become queen: &quot;Of the few possible Princesses (for of course any Lady in Society would never do) I think no one more likely to suit you and the position better than your Cousin Mossy  ... She is not regularly pretty but she has a very pretty figure, is very amiable and half English with great love for England which you will find in very few if any others.&quot; Although Albert Victor&#x27;s father approved, Queen Victoria&#x27;s secretary Henry Ponsonby informed her that Albert Victor&#x27;s mother &quot;would object most strongly and indeed has already done so.&quot; Nothing came of the Queen&#x27;s suggestion.

By this time however, Albert Victor was falling in love with Princess Hélène of Orléans, a daughter of Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, a pretender to the French throne who was living in England after being banished from France in 1886. At first, Queen Victoria opposed any engagement because Hélène was Roman Catholic. Once Albert Victor and Hélène confided their love to her, the Queen relented and supported the proposed marriage. Hélène offered to convert to the Church of England, and Albert Victor offered to renounce his succession rights to marry her.

To the couple&#x27;s disappointment, Hélène&#x27;s father refused to countenance the marriage and was adamant she could not convert. Hélène travelled personally to intercede with Pope Leo XIII, but he confirmed her father&#x27;s verdict, and the courtship ended. When Albert Victor died, his sisters Maud and Louise sympathized with Hélène and treated her, not his fiancée Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, as his true love. Maud told her that &quot;he is buried with your little coin around his neck&quot; and Louise said that he is &quot;yours in death&quot;. Hélène later became Duchess of Aosta.

By 1891, another potential bride, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, was under consideration. Mary was the daughter of Queen Victoria&#x27;s first cousin Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. The Queen was very supportive, considering Mary ideal—charming, sensible and pretty. On 3 December 1891 Albert Victor, to Mary&#x27;s &quot;great surprise&quot;, proposed to her at Luton Hoo, the country residence of the Danish ambassador to Britain. The wedding was set for 27 February 1892.

==Personal life==
In 1891, Albert Victor wrote to Lady Sybil St Clair Erskine that he was in love once again, though he does not say with whom. A week after the first letter, he asked Erskine, &quot;I wonder if you really love me a little? ... I should be very pleased if you did just a little bit.&quot;

In late 1891, Albert Victor was implicated as having been involved with a former Gaiety Theatre chorus girl, Lydia Miller (stage name Lydia Manton), who committed suicide by drinking carbolic acid. Although she was the nominal mistress of Lord Charles Montagu, who gave evidence at the inquest, it was alleged that he was merely a cover for the Prince, who had requested she give up her theatrical career on his behalf, and that the authorities sought to suppress the case by making the inquest private and refusing access to the depositions. Similarly to the Cleveland Street scandal, only overseas newspapers printed Albert Victor&#x27;s name, but regional British newspapers did quote the radical London newspaper &quot;The Star&quot; which published: &quot;It is a fact so well known that the blind denials of it given in some quarters are childishly futile. Lydia Manton was the &quot;petite amie&quot; of a certain young prince, and that, too, quite recently.&quot; It was labelled &quot;a scandal of the first magnitude ... on the lips of every clubman&quot;, and compared to the Tranby Croft affair, in which his father was called to give evidence at a trial for slander.

Rumours also surfaced in 1900, after Albert Victor&#x27;s death, of his association with another former Gaiety girl, Maude Richardson (birth name: Louisa Lancey), and that the royal family had attempted to pay her off. In 2002, letters purported to have been sent by Albert Victor to his solicitor referring to a payoff made to Richardson of £200 were sold at Bonhams auction house in London. Owing to discrepancies in the dates and spelling of the letters, one historian has suggested they could be forgeries.

In mid-1890, Albert Victor was attended by several doctors. In Albert Victor&#x27;s and other correspondence, his illness is only referred to as &quot;fever&quot; or &quot;gout&quot;. Some biographers have assumed he was suffering from &quot;a mild form of venereal disease&quot;, perhaps gonorrhea, which he may have suffered from on an earlier occasion, but the exact nature of his illness is unknown. Letters dated 1885 and 1886 from Albert Victor to his doctor at Aldershot (known only as &quot;Roche&quot;) detail that he was taking medicine for &#x27;glete&#x27; (gleet), then a term for gonorrhea discharge.

==Death==

Just as plans for both his marriage to Mary and his appointment as Viceroy of Ireland were under discussion, Albert Victor fell ill in the pandemic of 1889–1892. He developed pneumonia and died at Sandringham House in Norfolk on 14 January 1892, less than a week after his 28th birthday.

Albert Victor&#x27;s parents, his sisters Princesses Maud and Victoria, his brother Prince George, his fiancée Princess Mary, her parents the Duke and Duchess of Teck, three physicians (Alan Reeve Manby, Francis Laking and William Broadbent) and three nurses were present. The Prince of Wales&#x27;s chaplain, Canon Frederick Hervey, stood over Albert Victor reading prayers for the dying.

The nation was shocked. Shops put up their shutters. The Prince of Wales wrote to the Queen, &quot;Gladly would I have given my life for his&quot;. Princess Mary wrote to the Queen of the Princess of Wales, &quot;the despairing look on her face was the most heart-rending thing I have ever seen.&quot; Prince George wrote, &quot;how deeply I did love him; &amp; I remember with pain nearly every hard word &amp; little quarrel I ever had with him &amp; I long to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, it is too late now!&quot; George took Albert Victor&#x27;s place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910. Drawn together during their shared period of mourning, Prince George later married Mary himself in 1893. She became queen consort on George&#x27;s accession.

Albert Victor&#x27;s mother, Alexandra, never fully recovered from her son&#x27;s death and kept the room in which he died as a shrine. At the funeral, Mary laid her intended bridal wreath of orange blossom upon the coffin. James Kenneth Stephen, Albert Victor&#x27;s former tutor, refused all food from the day of Albert Victor&#x27;s death and died 20 days later; he had suffered a head injury in 1886 which left him suffering from psychosis. The prince is buried in the Albert Memorial Chapel close to St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. His tomb, by Alfred Gilbert, is &quot;the finest single example of late 19th-century sculpture in the British Isles&quot;. A recumbent effigy of the Prince in a Hussar uniform (almost impossible to see properly &quot;in situ&quot;) lies above the tomb. Kneeling over him is an angel, holding a heavenly crown. The tomb is surrounded by an elaborate railing, with figures of saints. The perfectionist Gilbert spent too much on the commission, went bankrupt, and left the country. Five of the smaller figures were only completed with &quot;a greater roughness and pittedness of texture&quot; after his return to Britain in the 1920s.

One obituary, written by a journalist who claimed to have attended the majority of Albert Victor&#x27;s public appearances, stated:

He was little known personally to the English public. His absence at sea, and on travels and duty with his regiment, kept him out of the general eye ... at times, there was a sallowness of hue, which much increased the grave aspect ... not only in the metropolis, but throughout the country, somehow, it was always said, &#x27;He will never come to the throne.
==Legacy==

During his life, the bulk of the British press treated Albert Victor with nothing but respect and the eulogies that immediately followed his death were full of praise. The radical politician Henry Broadhurst, who had met both Albert Victor and his brother George, noted that they had &quot;a total absence of affectation or haughtiness&quot;. On the day of Albert Victor&#x27;s death, the leading Liberal politician, William Ewart Gladstone, wrote in his personal private diary &quot;a great loss to our party&quot;. However, Queen Victoria referred to Albert Victor&#x27;s &quot;dissipated life&quot; in private letters to her eldest daughter, which were later published.

In the mid-20th century, the official biographers of Queen Mary and King George V, James Pope-Hennessy and Harold Nicolson respectively, promoted hostile assessments of Albert Victor&#x27;s life, portraying him as lazy, ill-educated and physically feeble. The exact nature of his &quot;dissipations&quot; is not clear, but in 1994 Theo Aronson favoured the theory on &quot;admittedly circumstantial&quot; evidence that the &quot;unspecified &#x27;dissipations&#x27; were predominantly homosexual&quot;. Aronson&#x27;s judgement was based on Albert Victor&#x27;s &quot;adoration of his elegant and possessive mother; his &#x27;want of manliness&#x27;; his &#x27;shrinking from horseplay&#x27;; [and] his &#x27;sweet, gentle, quiet and charming&#x27; nature&quot;, as well as the Cleveland Street rumours and his opinion that there is &quot;a certain amount of homosexuality in all men&quot;. He admitted, however, that &quot;the allegations of Prince Eddy&#x27;s homosexuality must be treated cautiously.&quot;

Rumours that Albert Victor may have committed, or been responsible for, the Jack the Ripper murders were first mentioned in print in 1962. It was later alleged, among others by Stephen Knight in &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot;, that Albert Victor fathered a child with a woman in the Whitechapel district of London, and either he or several high-ranking men committed the murders in an effort to cover up his indiscretion. Though such claims have been repeated frequently, scholars have dismissed them as fantasies, and refer to indisputable proof of the Prince&#x27;s innocence.

For example, on 30 September 1888, when Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were murdered in London, Albert Victor was at Balmoral in Scotland. According to the official Court Circular, family journals and letters, newspaper reports and other sources, he could not have been near any of the murders. Other fanciful conspiracy theories are that he died of syphilis or poison, that he was pushed off a cliff on the instructions of Lord Randolph Churchill, or that his death was faked to remove him from the line of succession.

Albert Victor&#x27;s posthumous reputation became so bad that in 1964 Philip Magnus called his death a &quot;merciful act of providence&quot;, supporting the theory that his death removed an unsuitable heir to the throne and replaced him with the reliable and sober George V. In 1972, Michael Harrison was the first modern author to re-assess Albert Victor and portray him in a more sympathetic light. Biographer Andrew Cook continued attempts to rehabilitate Albert Victor&#x27;s reputation, arguing that his lack of academic progress was partly due to the incompetence of his tutor, Dalton; that he was a warm and charming man; that there is no tangible evidence that he was homosexual or bisexual; that he held liberal views, particularly on Irish Home Rule; and that his reputation was diminished by biographers eager to improve the image of his brother, George.

===Fictional portrayals===
The conspiracy theories surrounding Albert Victor have led to his portrayal in film as somehow responsible for or involved in the Jack the Ripper murders. Bob Clark&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes mystery &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; was released in 1979 with &quot;Duke of Clarence (Eddy)&quot; played by Robin Marchal. &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; was released in 1988 with Marc Culwick as Prince Albert Victor. Samuel West played &quot;Prince Eddy&quot; in &quot;The Ripper&quot; (1997), having previously played Albert Victor as a child in the 1975 TV miniseries &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;. Albert Victor was portrayed at older ages in &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; by, successively, Jerome Watts and Charles Dance.

From 1989 to 1998 Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell published the graphic novel &quot;From Hell&quot; in serialized form, which is based on Stephen Knight&#x27;s theory. It was adapted into a 2001 film of the same name by the Hughes brothers. Mark Dexter portrayed both &quot;Prince Edward&quot; and &quot;Albert Sickert&quot;. The story, based largely on the same sources as &quot;Murder by Decree&quot;, is also the basis for the play &quot;Force and Hypocrisy&quot; by Doug Lucie. He also appears as a major but offstage character in the 2023 &quot;The Flea&quot;, based on the Cleveland Street scandal.

<text>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC ) is an organization enabling the co-operation of leading oil-producing and oil-dependent countries in order to collectively influence the global oil market and maximize profit. It was founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. The organization, which currently comprises 12 member countries, accounted for 38 percent of global oil production, according to a 2022 report. Additionally, it is estimated that 79.5 percent of the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves are located within OPEC nations, with the Middle East alone accounting for 67.2 percent of OPEC&#x27;s total reserves.

In a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;). In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. Since the 1980s, OPEC has had a limited impact on world oil-supply and oil-price stability, as there is frequent cheating by members on their commitments to one another, and as member commitments reflect what they would do even in the absence of OPEC. 

The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources. OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and in international relations. Economists have characterized OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel
(a group whose members cooperate to reduce market competition) but one whose consultations may be protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law.

 Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Angola, Ecuador, Indonesia, and Qatar are former OPEC members. A larger group called OPEC+, consisting of OPEC members plus other oil-producing countries, formed in late 2016 to exert more control on the global crude oil market. Canada, Egypt, Norway, and Oman are observer states.

==Organization and structure==
In a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the Seven Sisters). Coordination among oil-producing states within OPEC made it easier for them to nationalize oil production and structure oil prices in their favor without incurring punishment by Western governments and firms. Prior to the creation of OPEC, individual oil-producing states were punished for taking steps to alter the governing arrangements of oil production within their borders. States were coerced militarily (e.g. in 1953, the US-UK-sponsored a coup against Mohammad Mosaddegh after he nationalized Iran&#x27;s oil production) or economically (e.g. the Seven Sisters slowed down oil production in one non-compliant state and ramped up oil production elsewhere) when acted contrary to the interests of the Seven Sisters and their governments.

The organisational logic that underpins OPEC is that it is in the collective interest of its members to limit the world oil supply in order to reap higher prices. However, the main problem within OPEC is that it is individually rational for members to cheat on commitments and produce as much oil as possible.

Political scientist Jeff Colgan has argued that OPEC has since the 1980s largely failed to achieve its goals (limits on world oil supply, stabilized prices, and raising of long-term average revenues). He finds that members have cheated on 96% of their commitments. The analysis spans over the period 1982–2009. To the extent that when member states comply with their commitments, it is because the commitments reflect what they would do even if OPEC did not exist. One large reason for the frequent cheating is that OPEC does not punish members for non-compliance with commitments.

In June 2020, all countries participating in the OPEC+ framework collectively agreed to the introduction of a Compensation Mechanism aimed at ensuring full conformity with and adherence to the agreed-upon oil production cuts. This initiative aligns with one of OPEC&#x27;s stated objectives: to maintain a stable oil market, which, notably, has been relatively more stable than other energy commodities.

=== Leadership and decision-making ===
The OPEC Conference is the supreme authority of the organisation, and consists of delegations normally headed by the oil ministers of member countries. The chief executive of the organisation is the OPEC secretary general. The conference ordinarily meets at the Vienna headquarters, at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary. It generally operates on the principles of unanimity and &quot;one member, one vote&quot;, with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget. However, since Saudi Arabia is by far the largest and most-profitable oil exporter in the world, with enough capacity to function as the traditional swing producer to balance the global market, it serves as &quot;OPEC&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader&quot;.

=== International cartel ===
At various times, OPEC members have displayed apparent anti-competitive cartel behavior through the organisation&#x27;s agreements about oil production and price levels. Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition, as in this definition from OECD&#x27;s &quot;Glossary of Industrial Organisation Economics and Competition Law&quot;:

While OPEC is at times cited as a textbook example of a cartel, various authoritative and academic sources provide a broader perspective on the organization&#x27;s role. For instance, the US Energy Information Administration&#x27;s glossary explains OPEC as:

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Energy Science&quot; (2017) defines OPEC as:

OPEC members strongly prefer to describe their organisation as a modest force for market stabilisation, rather than a powerful anti-competitive cartel. In its defense, the organisation was founded as a counterweight against the previous &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; cartel of multinational oil companies, and non-OPEC energy suppliers have maintained enough market share for a substantial degree of worldwide competition. Moreover, because of an economic &quot;prisoner&#x27;s dilemma&quot; that encourages each member nation individually to discount its price and exceed its production quota, widespread cheating within OPEC often erodes its ability to influence global oil prices through collective action. Political scientist Jeff Colgan has challenged that OPEC is a cartel, pointing to endemic cheating in the organization: &quot;A cartel needs to set tough goals and meet them; OPEC sets easy goals and fails to meet even those.&quot;

OPEC has not been involved in any disputes related to the competition rules of the World Trade Organization, even though the objectives, actions, and principles of the two organisations diverge considerably. A key US District Court decision held that OPEC consultations are protected as &quot;governmental&quot; acts of state by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and are therefore beyond the legal reach of US competition law governing &quot;commercial&quot; acts. Despite popular sentiment against OPEC, legislative proposals to limit the organisation&#x27;s sovereign immunity, such as the NOPEC Act, have so far been unsuccessful.

===Conflicts===
OPEC often has difficulty agreeing on policy decisions because its member countries differ widely in their oil export capacities, production costs, reserves, geological features, population, economic development, budgetary situations, and political circumstances. Indeed, over the course of market cycles, oil reserves can themselves become a source of serious conflict, instability and imbalances, in what economists call the &quot;natural resource curse&quot;. A further complication is that religion-linked conflicts in the Middle East are recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil-rich region. Internationally important conflicts in OPEC&#x27;s history have included the Six-Day War (1967), Yom Kippur War (1973), a hostage siege directed by Palestinian militants (1975), the Iranian Revolution (1979), Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), Iraqi occupation of Kuwait (1990–1991), September 11 attacks (2001), American occupation of Iraq (2003–2011), Conflict in the Niger Delta (2004–present), Arab Spring (2010–2012), Libyan Crisis (2011–present), and international Embargo against Iran (2012–2016). Although events such as these can temporarily disrupt oil supplies and elevate prices, the frequent disputes and instabilities tend to limit OPEC&#x27;s long-term cohesion and effectiveness.

==History and impact==

===Post-WWII situation===
In 1949, Venezuela initiated the move towards the establishment of what would become OPEC, by inviting Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to exchange views and explore avenues for more regular and closer communication among petroleum-exporting nations as the world recovered from World War II. At the time, some of the world&#x27;s largest oil fields were just entering production in the Middle East. The United States had established the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to join the Texas Railroad Commission in limiting overproduction. The US was simultaneously the world&#x27;s largest producer and consumer of oil; the world market was dominated by a group of multinational companies known as the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, five of which were headquartered in the US following the breakup of John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s original Standard Oil monopoly. Oil-exporting countries were eventually motivated to form OPEC as a counterweight to this concentration of political and economic power.

===1959–1960: Anger from exporting countries===
In February 1959, as new supplies were becoming available, the multinational oil companies (MOCs) unilaterally reduced their posted prices for Venezuelan and Middle Eastern crude oil by 10 percent. Weeks later, the Arab League&#x27;s first Arab Petroleum Congress convened in Cairo, Egypt, where the influential journalist Wanda Jablonski introduced Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Abdullah Tariki to Venezuela&#x27;s observer Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo, representing the two then-largest oil-producing nations outside the United States and the Soviet Union. Both oil ministers were angered by the price cuts, and the two led their fellow delegates to establish the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement, calling for an &quot;Oil Consultation Commission&quot; of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans. Jablonski reported a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against &quot;absentee landlordism&quot; of the MOCs, which at the time controlled all oil operations within the exporting countries and wielded enormous political influence. In August 1960, ignoring the warnings, and with the US favoring Canadian and Mexican oil for strategic reasons, the MOCs again unilaterally announced significant cuts in their posted prices for Middle Eastern crude oil.

===1960–1975: Founding and expansion===

The following month, during 10–14 September 1960, the Baghdad Conference was held at the initiative of Tariki, Pérez Alfonzo, and Iraqi prime minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, whose country had skipped the 1959 congress. Government representatives from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela met in Baghdad to discuss ways to increase the price of crude oil produced by their countries, and ways to respond to unilateral actions by the MOCs. Despite strong US opposition: &quot;Together with Arab and non-Arab producers, Saudi Arabia formed the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) to secure the best price available from the major oil corporations.&quot; The Middle Eastern members originally called for OPEC headquarters to be in Baghdad or Beirut, but Venezuela argued for a neutral location, and so the organization chose Geneva, Switzerland. On 1 September 1965, OPEC moved to Vienna, Austria, after Switzerland declined to extend diplomatic privileges. At the time, Switzerland was attempting to reduce their foreign population and the OPEC was the first intergovernmental body to leave the country because of restrictions on foreigners. Austria was keen to attract international organizations and offered attractive terms to the OPEC.

During the early years of OPEC, the oil-producing countries had a 50/50 profit agreement with the oil companies. OPEC bargained with the dominant oil companies (the Seven Sisters), but OPEC faced coordination problems among its members. If one OPEC member demanded too much from the oil companies, then the oil companies could slow down production in that country and ramp up production elsewhere. The 50/50 agreements were still in place until 1970 when Libya negotiated a 58/42 agreement with the oil company Occidental, which prompted other OPEC members to request better agreements with oil companies.&gt; In 1971, an accord was signed between major oil companies and members of OPEC doing business in the Mediterranean Sea region, called the &quot;Tripoli Agreement&quot;. The agreement, signed on 2 April 1971, raised oil prices and increased producing countries&#x27; profit shares.

During 1961–1975, the five founding nations were joined by Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962–2008, rejoined 2014–2016), Libya (1962), United Arab Emirates (originally just the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973–1992, 2007–2020), and Gabon (1975–1994, rejoined 2016). By the early 1970s, OPEC&#x27;s membership accounted for more than half of worldwide oil production. Indicating that OPEC is not averse to further expansion, Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC&#x27;s acting secretary general in 2006, urged his African neighbors Angola and Sudan to join, and Angola did in 2007, followed by Equatorial Guinea in 2017. Since the 1980s, representatives from Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers, as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.

===1973–1974: Oil embargo===
The oil market was tight in the early 1970s, which reduced the risks for OPEC members in nationalising their oil production. One of the major fears for OPEC members was that nationalisation would cause a steep decline in the price of oil. This prompted a wave of nationalisations in countries such as Libya, Algeria, Iraq, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. With greater control over oil production decisions and amid high oil prices, OPEC members unilaterally raised oil prices in 1973, prompting the 1973 oil crisis.

In October 1973, the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective in response to the Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of petrol that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when petrol could be purchased, based on number plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974, following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.
The 1973–1974 oil embargo had lasting effects on the United States and other industrialized nations, which established the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better building insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption rose only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil could be used as both a political and economic weapon against other nations, at least in the short term.

The embargo also meant that a section of the Non-Aligned Movement saw power as a source of hope for their developing countries. The Algerian president Houari Boumédiène expressed this hope in a speech at the UN&#x27;s sixth Special Session, in April 1974:

===1975–1980: Special Fund, now the OPEC Fund for International Development===

OPEC&#x27;s international aid activities date from well before the 1973–1974 oil price surge. For example, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development has operated since 1961.

In the years after 1973, as an example of so-called &quot;checkbook diplomacy&quot;, certain Arab nations have been among the world&#x27;s largest providers of foreign aid, and OPEC added to its goals the selling of oil for the socio-economic growth of poorer nations. The OPEC Special Fund was conceived in Algiers, Algeria, in March 1975, and was formally established the following January. &quot;A Solemn Declaration &#x27;reaffirmed the natural solidarity which unites OPEC countries with other developing countries in their struggle to overcome underdevelopment,&#x27; and called for measures to strengthen cooperation between these countries... [The OPEC Special Fund&#x27;s] resources are additional to those already made available by OPEC states through a number of bilateral and multilateral channels.&quot; The Fund became an official international development agency in May 1980 and was renamed the OPEC Fund for International Development, with Permanent Observer status at the United Nations. In 2020, the institution ceased using the abbreviation OFID.

===1975: Hostage siege===
On 21 December 1975, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Iran&#x27;s Jamshid Amuzegar, and the other OPEC oil ministers were taken hostage at their semi-annual conference in Vienna, Austria. The attack, which killed three non-ministers, was orchestrated by a six-person team led by Venezuelan terrorist &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot;, and which included Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann and Hans-Joachim Klein. The self-named &quot;Arm of the Arab Revolution&quot; group declared its goal to be the liberation of Palestine. Carlos planned to take over the conference by force and hold for ransom all eleven attending oil ministers, except for Yamani and Amuzegar who were to be executed.

Carlos arranged bus and plane travel for his team and 42 of the original 63 hostages, with stops in Algiers and Tripoli, planning to fly eventually to Baghdad, where Yamani and Amuzegar were to be killed. All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in Algiers, excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to Algiers. With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian president Houari Boumédiène, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers&#x27; deaths would result in an attack on the plane. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. Carlos expressed his regret at not being able to murder Yamani and Amuzegar, then he and his comrades left the plane. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.

Sometime after the attack, Carlos&#x27;s accomplices revealed that the operation was commanded by Wadie Haddad, a founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, itself an OPEC member. Fellow militants Bassam Abu Sharif and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between 20 million and US$50 million from &quot;an Arab president&quot;. Carlos claimed that Saudi Arabia paid ransom on behalf of Iran, but that the money was &quot;diverted en route and lost by the Revolution&quot;. He was finally captured in 1994 and is serving life sentences for at least 16 other murders.

===1979–1980: Oil crisis and 1980s oil glut===
In response to a wave of oil nationalizations and the high prices of the 1970s, industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on OPEC oil, especially after prices reached new peaks approaching US$40/bbl in 1979–1980 when the Iranian Revolution and Iran–Iraq War disrupted regional stability and oil supplies. Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal, natural gas, or nuclear power; national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil; and commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. By 1986, daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5 million barrels, non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount, and OPEC&#x27;s market share sank from approximately 50 percent in 1979 to less than 30 percent in 1985. Illustrating the volatile multi-year timeframes of typical market cycles for natural resources, the result was a six-year decline in the price of oil, which culminated by plunging more than half in 1986 alone. As one oil analyst summarized succinctly: &quot;When the price of something as essential as oil spikes, humanity does two things: finds more of it and finds ways to use less of it.&quot;

To combat falling revenue from oil sales, in 1982 Saudi Arabia pressed OPEC for audited national production quotas in an attempt to limit output and boost prices. When other OPEC nations failed to comply, Saudi Arabia first slashed its own production from 10 million barrels daily in 1979–1981 to just one-third of that level in 1985. When even this proved ineffective, Saudi Arabia reversed course and flooded the market with cheap oil, causing prices to fall below US$10/bbl and higher-cost producers to become unprofitable.

These strategic measures by Saudi Arabia to regulate oil prices had profound economic repercussions. As the swing producer in that period, the Kingdom faced significant economic strain. Its revenues dramatically decreased from $119 billion in 1981 to $26 billion by 1985, leading to substantial budget deficits and a doubling of its debt, reaching 100% of the Gross Domestic Product.

Faced with increasing economic hardship (which ultimately contributed to the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989), the &quot;free-riding&quot; oil exporters that had previously failed to comply with OPEC agreements finally began to limit production to shore up prices, based on painstakingly negotiated national quotas that sought to balance oil-related and economic criteria since 1986. (Within their sovereign-controlled territories, the national governments of OPEC members are able to impose production limits on both government-owned and private oil companies.) Generally when OPEC production targets are reduced, oil prices increase.

===1990–2003: Ample supply and modest disruptions===


Leading up to his August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was pushing OPEC to end overproduction and to send oil prices higher, in order to help OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.

In the 1990s, OPEC lost its two newest members, who had joined in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2 million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization&#x27;s founding, but Iraqi production was not a part of OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country&#x27;s daunting political difficulties.

Lower demand triggered by the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis saw the price of oil fall back to 1986 levels. After oil slumped to around US$10/bbl, joint diplomacy achieved a gradual slowing of oil production by OPEC, Mexico and Norway. After prices slumped again in Nov. 2001, OPEC, Norway, Mexico, Russia, Oman and Angola agreed to cut production on 1 January 2002 for 6 months. OPEC contributed 1.5 million barrels a day (mbpd) to the approximately 2 mbpd of cuts announced.

In June 2003, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC held their first joint workshop on energy issues. They have continued to meet regularly since then, &quot;to collectively better understand trends, analysis and viewpoints and advance market transparency and predictability.&quot;

===2003–2011: Volatility===
Widespread insurgency and sabotage occurred during the 2003–2008 height of the American occupation of Iraq, coinciding with rapidly increasing oil demand from China and commodity-hungry investors, recurring violence against the Nigerian oil industry, and dwindling spare capacity as a cushion against potential shortages. This combination of forces prompted a sharp rise in oil prices to levels far higher than those previously targeted by OPEC. Price volatility reached an extreme in 2008, as WTI crude oil surged to a record US$147/bbl in July and then plunged back to US$32/bbl in December, during the worst global recession since World War II. OPEC&#x27;s annual oil export revenue also set a new record in 2008, estimated around US$1 trillion, and reached similar annual rates in 2011–2014 (along with extensive petrodollar recycling activity) before plunging again. By the time of the 2011 Libyan Civil War and Arab Spring, OPEC started issuing explicit statements to counter &quot;excessive speculation&quot; in oil futures markets, blaming financial speculators for increasing volatility beyond market fundamentals.

In May 2008, Indonesia announced that it would leave OPEC when its membership expired at the end of that year, having become a net importer of oil and being unable to meet its production quota. A statement released by OPEC on 10 September 2008 confirmed Indonesia&#x27;s withdrawal, noting that OPEC &quot;regretfully accepted the wish of Indonesia to suspend its full membership in the organization, and recorded its hope that the country would be in a position to rejoin the organization in the not-too-distant future.&quot;

===2008: Production dispute===

The differing economic needs of OPEC member states often affect the internal debates behind OPEC production quotas. Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members, to increase the price of oil and thus their own revenues. These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia&#x27;s stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world&#x27;s economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion. Part of the basis for this policy is the Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable supply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually leaving unneeded barrels in the ground. To this point, Saudi Oil Minister Yamani famously remarked in 1973: &quot;The Stone Age didn&#x27;t end because we ran out of stones.&quot; To elucidate Saudi Arabia&#x27;s contemporary approach, in 2024, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman articulated a stance that reflects how the kingdom has adapted to the evolving economic needs within OPEC and the broader international community. Emphasizing the need for a balanced and fair global energy transition, he highlighted the importance of diversifying energy sources and noted significant investments in natural gas, petrochemicals, and renewables. These efforts support economic development in emerging countries and align with global climate objectives. Additionally, he addressed shifting energy security concerns, stating, &quot;Energy security in the 70s, 80s, and 90s was more dependent on oil. Now, you get what happened last year... It was gas. The future problem on energy security will not be oil. It will be renewables. And the materials, and the mines.&quot;

On 10 September 2008, with oil prices still near US$100/bbl, a production dispute occurred when the Saudis reportedly walked out of a negotiating session where rival members voted to reduce OPEC output. Although Saudi delegates officially endorsed the new quotas, they stated anonymously that they would not observe them. &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted one such delegate as saying: &quot;Saudi Arabia will meet the market&#x27;s demand. We will see what the market requires and we will not leave a customer without oil. The policy has not changed.&quot; Over the next few months, oil prices plummeted into the $30s, and did not return to $100 until the Libyan Civil War in 2011.

===2014–2017: Oil glut===

During 2014–2015, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a slowdown in economic growth. At the same time, US oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels and approached the world-leading &quot;swing producer&quot; volumes of Saudi Arabia and Russia, due to the substantial long-term improvement and spread of shale &quot;fracking&quot; technology in response to the years of record oil prices. These developments led in turn to a plunge in US oil import requirements (moving closer to energy independence), a record volume of worldwide oil inventories, and a collapse in oil prices that continued into early 2016.

In spite of global oversupply, on 27 November 2014 in Vienna, Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi blocked appeals from poorer OPEC members for production cuts to support prices. Naimi argued that the oil market should be left to rebalance itself competitively at lower price levels, strategically rebuilding OPEC&#x27;s long-term market share by ending the profitability of high-cost US shale oil production. As he explained in an interview:

Is it reasonable for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while the producer of poor efficiency continues to produce? That is crooked logic. If I reduce, what happens to my market share? The price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, US shale oil producers will take my share... We want to tell the world that high-efficiency producing countries are the ones that deserve market share. That is the operative principle in all capitalist countries... One thing is for sure: Current prices [roughly US$60/bbl] do not support all producers.

A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the organization had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets appeared to be oversupplied by at least 2 million barrels per day despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as $40, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.

As 2016 continued, the oil glut was partially trimmed with significant production offline in the United States, Canada, Libya, Nigeria and China, and the basket price gradually rose back into the $40s. OPEC regained a modest percentage of market share, saw the cancellation of many competing drilling projects, maintained the status quo at its June conference, and endorsed &quot;prices at levels that are suitable for both producers and consumers&quot;, although many producers were still experiencing serious economic difficulties.

===2017–2020: Production cut and OPEC+===
As OPEC members grew weary of a multi-year supply-contest with diminishing returns and shrinking financial reserves, the organization finally attempted its first production cut since 2008. Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 million barrels per day was codified by a new quota-agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 – alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale-sector, Libya, Nigeria, spare capacity, and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another &quot;temporary suspension&quot; of its OPEC membership rather than accepting the organization&#x27;s requested 5-percent production-cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and in May 2017 OPEC decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil-inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then. Longtime oil analyst Daniel Yergin &quot;described the relationship between OPEC and shale as &#x27;mutual coexistence&#x27;, with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like.&quot; These production cut deals with non-OPEC countries are generally referred to as &quot;OPEC+&quot;.

In December 2017, Russia and OPEC agreed to extend the production cut of 1.8 mbpd until the end of 2018.

Qatar announced it would withdraw from OPEC effective 1 January 2019. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, this was a strategic response to the Qatar diplomatic crisis which Qatar was involved with Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt.

On 29 June 2019, Russia again agreed with Saudi Arabia to extend by six to nine months the original production cuts of 2018.

In October 2019, Ecuador announced it would withdraw from OPEC on 1 January 2020 due to financial problems facing the country.

In December 2019, OPEC and Russia agreed one of the deepest output cuts so far to prevent oversupply in a deal that will last for the first three months of 2020.

===2020: Saudi-Russian price war===

In early March 2020, OPEC officials presented an ultimatum to Russia to cut production by 1.5% of world supply. Russia, which foresaw continuing cuts as American shale oil production increased, rejected the demand, ending the three-year partnership between OPEC and major non-OPEC providers. Another factor was weakening global demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This also resulted in &#x27;OPEC plus&#x27; failing to extend the agreement cutting 2.1 million barrels per day that was set to expire at the end of March. Saudi Arabia, which has absorbed a disproportionate amount of the cuts to convince Russia to stay in the agreement, notified its buyers on 7 March that they would raise output and discount their oil in April. This prompted a Brent crude price crash of more than 30% before a slight recovery and widespread turmoil in financial markets.

Several pundits saw this as a Saudi-Russian price war, or game of chicken which cause the &quot;other side to blink first&quot;. Saudi Arabia had in March 2020 $500 billion of foreign exchange reserves, while at that time Russia&#x27;s reserves were $580 billion. The debt-to-GDP ratio of the Saudis was 25%, while the Russian ratio was 15%. Another remarked that the Saudis can produce oil at as low a price as $3 per barrel, whereas Russia needs $30 per barrel to cover production costs. &quot;To Russia, this price war is more than just about regaining market share for oil,&quot; one analyst claims. &quot;It’s about assaulting the Western economy, especially America’s.&quot; In order to ward off the oil exporters price war which can make shale oil production uneconomical, US may protect its crude oil market share by passing the NOPEC bill. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, represented by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, maintains a conciliatory stance towards the U.S. shale industry. He clarified that harming this sector was never their intention, stating, &quot;I made it clear that it was not on our radar or our intention to create any type of damage to their industry... they will rise again from the ashes and thrive and prosper.&quot; He also noted that Saudi Arabia is looking forward to a time when U.S. producers thrive once again in a market with higher oil demand.&quot;

In April 2020, OPEC and a group of other oil producers, including Russia, agreed to extend production cuts until the end of July. The cartel and its allies agreed to cut oil production in May and June by 9.7 million barrels a day, equal to around 10% of global output, in an effort to prop up prices, which had previously fallen to record lows.

===2021: Saudi-Emirati dispute===
In July 2021, OPEC+ member United Arab Emirates rejected a Saudi proposed eight-month extension to oil output curbs which was in place due to COVID-19 and lower oil consumption. The previous year, OPEC+ cut the equivalent of about 10% of demand at the time. The UAE asked for the maximum amount of oil the group would recognize the country of producing to be raised to 3.8 million barrels a day compared to its previous 3.2 million barrels. A compromise deal allowed UAE to increase its maximum oil output to 3.65 million barrels a day. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Russia would increase its production from 11 million barrels to 11.5 million by May 2022 as well. All members would increase output by 400,000 barrels per day each month starting in August to gradually offset the previous cuts made due to the COVID pandemic. This compromise, achieved where Saudi Arabia met the United Arab Emirates halfway, underscored OPEC+ unity. UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al-Mazrouei thanked Saudi Arabia and Russia for facilitating dialogue leading to an agreement. He stated, &quot;The UAE is committed to this group and will always work with it.&quot; On the Saudi side, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman emphasized consensus building and stated that the agreement strengthens OPEC+&#x27;s ties and ensures its continuity.

===2021–present: Global energy crisis===

The record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia. In August 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s national security adviser Jake Sullivan released a statement calling on OPEC+ to boost oil production to &quot;offset previous production cuts that OPEC+ imposed during the pandemic until well into 2022.&quot; On 28 September 2021, Sullivan met in Saudi Arabia with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the high oil prices. The price of oil was about US$80 by October 2021, the highest since 2014. President Joe Biden and U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm blamed the OPEC+ for rising oil and gas prices.

Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has altered the global oil trade. EU leaders tried to ban the majority of Russian crude imports, but even prior to the official action imports to Northwest Europe were down. More Russian oil is now sold outside of Europe, more specifically to India and China.

In October 2022, key OPEC+ ministers agreed to oil production cuts of 2 million barrels per day, the first production cut since 2020. This led to renewed interest in the passage of NOPEC.

===2022: Oil production cut===

In October 2022, OPEC+ led by Saudi Arabia announced a large cut to its oil output target in order to aid Russia . In response, US President Joe Biden vowed &quot;consequences&quot; and said the US government would &quot;re-evaluate&quot; the longstanding U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for a freeze on cooperation with and arms sales to Saudi Arabia, accusing the kingdom of helping Russia underwrite its war with Ukraine.

Saudi Arabia&#x27;s foreign ministry stated that the OPEC+ decision was &quot;purely economic&quot; and taken unanimously by all members of the conglomerate, pushing back on pressure to change its stance on the Russo-Ukrainian War at the UN. In response, the White House accused Saudi Arabia of pressuring other OPEC nations into agreeing with the production cut, some of which felt coerced, saying the United States had presented the Saudi government with an analysis showing there was no market basis for the cut. United States National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the Saudi government knew the decision will &quot;increase Russian revenues and blunt the effectiveness of sanctions&quot; against Moscow, rejecting the Saudi claim that the move was &quot;purely economic&quot;. According to a report in &quot;The Intercept&quot;, sources and experts said that Saudi Arabia had sought even deeper cuts than Russia, saying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to sway the 2022 United States elections in favor of the GOP and the 2024 United States presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. In contrast, Saudi officials maintain that their decision to reduce oil production was driven by concerns over the global economy, not political motivations. They state that the cuts were a response to the global economic situation and low inventories, which could trigger a rally in oil prices. Saudi Arabia affirms its actions by emphasizing its strategic partnership with the U.S., focusing on peace, security, and prosperity.

In 2023, the IEA predicted that demand for fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal would reach an all-time high by 2030. OPEC rejected the IEA&#x27;s forecast, saying &quot;what makes such predictions so dangerous, is that they are often accompanied by calls to stop investing in new oil and gas projects.&quot;

In November 2024, S&amp;P Global alleged that the UAE ignored the OPEC’s oil production cuts and produced around 700,000 barrels more than the agreed quota, that is, 2.91m barrels per day. Analysts asserted that the Emirates’ “quota busting” would underestimate Saudi and Russia’s efforts to increase oil prices by cutting production. While Russia was seeking to fund its war with Ukraine, Saudi had its own plans of diversifying the economy.

==Membership==
===Current member countries===
As of January 2024, OPEC has 12 member countries: five in the Middle East (West Asia), six in Africa, and one in South America. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC&#x27;s combined rate of oil production (including gas condensate) represented 44% of the world&#x27;s total in 2016, and OPEC accounted for 81.5% of the world&#x27;s &quot;proven&quot; oil reserves. Subsequent reports from 2022 indicate that OPEC member countries were then responsible for about 38% of total world crude oil production. It is also estimated that these countries hold 79.5% of the globe&#x27;s proven oil reserves, with the Middle East alone accounting for 67.2% of OPEC&#x27;s reserves.

Approval of a new member country requires agreement by three-quarters of OPEC&#x27;s existing members, including all five of the founders. In October 2015, Sudan formally submitted an application to join, but it is not yet a member.

=== OPEC+ ===
A number of non-OPEC member countries also participate in the organisation&#x27;s initiatives such as voluntary supply cuts in order to further bind policy objectives between OPEC and non-OPEC members. This loose grouping of countries, known as OPEC+, includes Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Russia, South Sudan and Sudan.

The collaboration among OPEC+ member countries has led to the establishment of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) in 2017, which has been subsequently extended multiple times due to its remarkable success. The DoC serves as a framework for cooperation and coordination between OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Additionally, OPEC+ members engage in further cooperative efforts through the Charter of Cooperation (CoC), which provides a platform for long-term collaboration. The CoC facilitates dialogue and the exchange of views on global oil and energy market conditions, with the overarching goal of ensuring a secure energy supply and fostering lasting stability that benefits producers, consumers, investors, and the global economy.

=== Observers ===
Since the 1980s, representatives from Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers. This arrangement serves as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.
==New members==
Uganda and Somalia with exploration of crude oil may join OPEC in the future, with likely new production dates of 2024-2025, expansion of OPEC with OPEC+ and new country&#x27;s in exploration, where criteria of OPEC Charter is production of crude oil.

===Lapsed members===

For countries that export petroleum at relatively low volume, their limited negotiating power as OPEC members would not necessarily justify the burdens imposed by OPEC production quotas and membership costs. Ecuador withdrew from OPEC in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2 million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under its OPEC quota at the time. Ecuador then rejoined in October 2007 before leaving again in January 2020. Ecuador&#x27;s Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources released an official statement on 2 January 2020 which confirmed that Ecuador had left OPEC. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016.

In May 2008, Indonesia announced that it would leave OPEC when its membership expired at the end of that year, having become a net importer of oil and being unable to meet its production quota. It rejoined the organization in January 2016, but announced another &quot;temporary suspension&quot; of its membership at year-end when OPEC requested a 5% production cut.

Qatar left OPEC on 1 January 2019, after joining the organization in 1961, to focus on natural gas production, of which it is the world&#x27;s largest exporter in the form of liquified natural gas (LNG).

In an OPEC meeting in November 2023, Nigeria and Angola, the biggest oil producers in Sub-Saharan Africa, expressed their discontent over OPEC&#x27;s quotas which, according to them, blocked their efforts to ramp up oil production and boost their foreign reserves. In December 2023, Angola announced it was leaving the OPEC because it disagreed with the organization&#x27;s production quotas scheme.

==Market information==
As one area in which OPEC members have been able to cooperate productively over the decades, the organisation has significantly improved the quality and quantity of information available about the international oil market. This is especially helpful for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of careful planning.

===Publications and research===

In April 2001, OPEC collaborated with five other international organizations (APEC, Eurostat, IEA, , UNSD) to improve the availability and reliability of oil data. They launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 was joined by IEF and renamed the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI), covering more than 90% of the global oil market. GECF joined as an eighth partner in 2014, enabling JODI also to cover nearly 90% of the global market for natural gas.

Since 2007, OPEC has published the &quot;World Oil Outlook&quot; (WOO) annually, in which it presents a comprehensive analysis of the global oil industry including medium- and long-term projections for supply and demand. OPEC also produces an &quot;Annual Statistical Bulletin&quot; (ASB), and publishes more-frequent updates in its &quot;Monthly Oil Market Report&quot; (MOMR) and &quot;OPEC Bulletin&quot;.

===Crude oil benchmarks===

A &quot;crude oil benchmark&quot; is a standardized petroleum product that serves as a convenient reference price for buyers and sellers of crude oil, including standardized contracts in major futures markets since 1983. Benchmarks are used because oil prices differ (usually by a few dollars per barrel) based on variety, grade, delivery date and location, and other legal requirements.

The OPEC Reference Basket of Crudes has been an important benchmark for oil prices since 2000. It is calculated as a weighted average of prices for petroleum blends from the OPEC member countries: Saharan Blend (Algeria), Girassol (Angola), Djeno (Republic of the Congo) Rabi Light (Gabon), Iran Heavy (Islamic Republic of Iran), Basra Light (Iraq), Kuwait Export (Kuwait), Es Sider (Libya), Bonny Light (Nigeria), Arab Light (Saudi Arabia), Murban (UAE), and Merey (Venezuela).

North Sea Brent Crude Oil is the leading benchmark for Atlantic basin crude oils and is used to price approximately two-thirds of the world&#x27;s traded crude oil. Other well-known benchmarks are West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Dubai Crude, Oman Crude, and Urals oil.

===Spare capacity===
The US Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the US Department of Energy, defines spare capacity for crude oil market management &quot;as the volume of production that can be brought on within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days ... OPEC spare capacity provides an indicator of the world oil market&#x27;s ability to respond to potential crises that reduce oil supplies.&quot;

In November 2014, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that OPEC&#x27;s &quot;effective&quot; spare capacity, adjusted for ongoing disruptions in countries like Libya and Nigeria, was and that this number would increase to a peak in 2017 of . By November 2015, the IEA changed its assessment &quot;with OPEC&#x27;s spare production buffer stretched thin, as Saudi Arabia – which holds the lion&#x27;s share of excess capacity – and its [Persian] Gulf neighbours pump at near-record rates.&quot;

<doc id="166352" wikidata="Q5643770" url="?curid=166352" title="Sides of an equation">
<text>In mathematics, LHS is informal shorthand for the left-hand side of an equation. Similarly, RHS is the right-hand side. The two sides have the same value, expressed differently, since equality is symmetric.

More generally, these terms may apply to an inequation or inequality; the right-hand side is everything on the right side of a test operator in an expression, with LHS defined similarly.

== Example ==
The expression on the right side of the &quot;=&quot; sign is the right side of the equation and the expression on the left of the &quot;=&quot; is the left side of the equation.

For example, in
:formula_1

 is the left-hand side (LHS) and is the right-hand side (RHS).

==Homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations==
In solving mathematical equations, particularly linear simultaneous equations, differential equations and integral equations, the terminology &quot;homogeneous&quot; is often used for equations with some linear operator &quot;L&quot; on the LHS and 0 on the RHS. In contrast, an equation with a non-zero RHS is called &quot;inhomogeneous&quot; or &quot;non-homogeneous&quot;, as exemplified by

:&quot;Lf&quot; = &quot;g&quot;,

with &quot;g&quot; a fixed function, which equation is to be solved for &quot;f&quot;. Then any solution of the inhomogeneous equation may have a solution of the homogeneous equation added to it, and still remain a solution.

For example in mathematical physics, the homogeneous equation may correspond to a physical theory formulated in empty space, while the inhomogeneous equation asks for more &#x27;realistic&#x27; solutions with some matter, or charged particles.

==Syntax==
More abstractly, when using infix notation

:&quot;T&quot; * &quot;U&quot;

the term &quot;T&quot; stands as the left-hand side and &quot;U&quot; as the right-hand side of the operator *. This usage is less common, though.

<doc id="166354" wikidata="Q4863070" url="?curid=166354" title="Barotropic vorticity equation">
<text>The barotropic vorticity equation assumes the atmosphere is nearly barotropic, which means that the direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. In other words, there is no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and the Bermuda-Azores high) and cold-core lows have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow Arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as tropical cyclones).

A simplified form of the vorticity equation for an inviscid, divergence-free flow (solenoidal velocity field), the barotropic vorticity equation can simply be stated as

:formula_1

where is the material derivative and

:formula_2

is &quot;absolute vorticity&quot;, with &quot;ζ&quot; being &quot;relative vorticity&quot;, defined as the vertical component of the curl of the fluid velocity and &quot;f&quot; is the &quot;Coriolis parameter&quot;

:formula_3

where Ω is the angular frequency of the planet&#x27;s rotation (Ω = for the earth) and &quot;φ&quot; is latitude.

In terms of &quot;relative vorticity&quot;, the equation can be rewritten as

:formula_4

where &quot;β&quot; =  is the variation of the &quot;Coriolis parameter&quot; with distance &quot;y&quot; in the north–south direction and &quot;v&quot; is the component of velocity in this direction.

In 1950, Charney, Fjørtoft, and von Neumann integrated this equation (with an added diffusion term on the right-hand side) on a computer for the first time, using an observed field of 500 hPa geopotential height for the first timestep. This was one of the first successful instances of numerical weather prediction.

<doc id="166356" wikidata="Q621476" url="?curid=166356" title="Pseudovector">
<text>In physics and mathematics, a pseudovector (or axial vector) is a quantity that behaves like a vector in many situations, but its direction does not conform when the object is rigidly transformed by rotation, translation, reflection, etc. This can also happen when the orientation of the space is changed. For example, the angular momentum is a pseudovector because it is often described as a vector, but by just changing the position of reference (and therefore changing the position vector), angular momentum can reverse direction, which is not supposed to happen with true vectors (also known as &quot;polar vectors&quot;).

One example of a pseudovector is the normal to an oriented plane. An oriented plane can be defined by two non-parallel vectors, a and b, that span the plane. The vector is a normal to the plane (there are two normals, one on each side – the right-hand rule will determine which), and is a pseudovector. This has consequences in computer graphics, where it has to be considered when transforming surface normals.
In three dimensions, the curl of a polar vector field at a point and the cross product of two polar vectors are pseudovectors.

A number of quantities in physics behave as pseudovectors rather than polar vectors, including magnetic field and angular velocity. In mathematics, in three dimensions, pseudovectors are equivalent to &quot;bivectors&quot;, from which the transformation rules of pseudovectors can be derived. More generally, in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional geometric algebra, pseudovectors are the elements of the algebra with dimension , written ⋀&quot;n&quot;−1R&quot;n&quot;. The label &quot;pseudo-&quot; can be further generalized to &quot;pseudoscalars&quot; and &quot;pseudotensors&quot;, both of which gain an extra sign-flip under improper rotations compared to a true scalar or tensor.

==Physical examples==
Physical examples of pseudovectors include torque, angular velocity, angular momentum, magnetic field, vorticity and magnetic dipole moment.

Consider the pseudovector angular momentum . Driving in a car, and looking forward, each of the wheels has an angular momentum vector pointing to the left. If the world is reflected in a mirror which switches the left and right side of the car, the &quot;reflection&quot; of this angular momentum &quot;vector&quot; (viewed as an ordinary vector) points to the right, but the &quot;actual&quot; angular momentum vector of the wheel (which is still turning forward in the reflection) still points to the left, corresponding to the extra sign flip in the reflection of a pseudovector.

The distinction between polar vectors and pseudovectors becomes important in understanding the effect of symmetry on the solution to physical systems. Consider an electric current loop in the plane that inside the loop generates a magnetic field oriented in the &quot;z&quot; direction. This system is symmetric (invariant) under mirror reflections through this plane, with the magnetic field unchanged by the reflection. But reflecting the magnetic field as a vector through that plane would be expected to reverse it; this expectation is corrected by realizing that the magnetic field is a pseudovector, with the extra sign flip leaving it unchanged.

In physics, pseudovectors are generally the result of taking the cross product of two polar vectors or the curl of a polar vector field. The cross product and curl are defined, by convention, according to the right hand rule, but could have been just as easily defined in terms of a left-hand rule. The entire body of physics that deals with (right-handed) pseudovectors and the right hand rule could be replaced by using (left-handed) pseudovectors and the left hand rule without issue. The (left) pseudovectors so defined would be opposite in direction to those defined by the right-hand rule.

While vector relationships in physics can be expressed in a coordinate-free manner, a coordinate system is required in order to express vectors and pseudovectors as numerical quantities. Vectors are represented as ordered triplets of numbers: e.g. formula_1, and pseudovectors are represented in this form too. When transforming between left and right-handed coordinate systems, representations of pseudovectors do not transform as vectors, and treating them as vector representations will cause an incorrect sign change, so that care must be taken to keep track of which ordered triplets represent vectors, and which represent pseudovectors. This problem does not exist if the cross product of two vectors is replaced by the exterior product of the two vectors, which yields a bivector which is a 2nd rank tensor and is represented by a 3×3 matrix. This representation of the 2-tensor transforms correctly between any two coordinate systems, independently of their handedness.

==Details==
The definition of a &quot;vector&quot; in physics (including both polar vectors and pseudovectors) is more specific than the mathematical definition of &quot;vector&quot; (namely, any element of an abstract vector space). Under the physics definition, a &quot;vector&quot; is required to have components that &quot;transform&quot; in a certain way under a proper rotation: In particular, if everything in the universe were rotated, the vector would rotate in exactly the same way. (The coordinate system is fixed in this discussion; in other words this is the perspective of active transformations.) Mathematically, if everything in the universe undergoes a rotation described by a rotation matrix &quot;R&quot;, so that a displacement vector x is transformed to , then any &quot;vector&quot; v must be similarly transformed to . This important requirement is what distinguishes a &quot;vector&quot; (which might be composed of, for example, the &quot;x&quot;-, &quot;y&quot;-, and &quot;z&quot;-components of velocity) from any other triplet of physical quantities (For example, the length, width, and height of a rectangular box &quot;cannot&quot; be considered the three components of a vector, since rotating the box does not appropriately transform these three components.)

(In the language of differential geometry, this requirement is equivalent to defining a &quot;vector&quot; to be a tensor of contravariant rank one. In this more general framework, higher rank tensors can also have arbitrarily many and mixed covariant and contravariant ranks at the same time, denoted by raised and lowered indices within the Einstein summation convention.)

A basic and rather concrete example is that of row and column vectors under the usual matrix multiplication operator: in one order they yield the dot product, which is just a scalar and as such a rank zero tensor, while in the other they yield the dyadic product, which is a matrix representing a rank two mixed tensor, with one contravariant and one covariant index. As such, the noncommutativity of standard matrix algebra can be used to keep track of the distinction between covariant and contravariant vectors. This is in fact how the bookkeeping was done before the more formal and generalised tensor notation came to be. It still manifests itself in how the basis vectors of general tensor spaces are exhibited for practical manipulation.

The discussion so far only relates to proper rotations, i.e. rotations about an axis. However, one can also consider improper rotations, i.e. a mirror-reflection possibly followed by a proper rotation. (One example of an improper rotation is inversion through a point in 3-dimensional space.) Suppose everything in the universe undergoes an improper rotation described by the improper rotation matrix &quot;R&quot;, so that a position vector x is transformed to . If the vector v is a polar vector, it will be transformed to . If it is a pseudovector, it will be transformed to .

The transformation rules for polar vectors and pseudovectors can be compactly stated as

: formula_2

where the symbols are as described above, and the rotation matrix &quot;R&quot; can be either proper or improper. The symbol det denotes determinant; this formula works because the determinant of proper and improper rotation matrices are +1 and −1, respectively.

===Behavior under addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication===

Suppose v1 and v2 are known pseudovectors, and v3 is defined to be their sum, . If the universe is transformed by a rotation matrix &quot;R&quot;, then v3 is transformed to

: formula_3

So v3 is also a pseudovector. Similarly one can show that the difference between two pseudovectors is a pseudovector, that the sum or difference of two polar vectors is a polar vector, that multiplying a polar vector by any real number yields another polar vector, and that multiplying a pseudovector by any real number yields another pseudovector.

On the other hand, suppose v1 is known to be a polar vector, v2 is known to be a pseudovector, and v3 is defined to be their sum, . If the universe is transformed by an improper rotation matrix &quot;R&quot;, then v3 is transformed to

: formula_4

Therefore, v3 is neither a polar vector nor a pseudovector (although it is still a vector, by the physics definition). For an improper rotation, v3 does not in general even keep the same magnitude:

: formula_5.

If the magnitude of v3 were to describe a measurable physical quantity, that would mean that the laws of physics would not appear the same if the universe was viewed in a mirror. In fact, this is exactly what happens in the weak interaction: Certain radioactive decays treat &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; differently, a phenomenon which can be traced to the summation of a polar vector with a pseudovector in the underlying theory. (See parity violation.)

===Behavior under cross products===
For a rotation matrix &quot;R&quot;, either proper or improper, the following mathematical equation is always true:
:formula_6,
where v1 and v2 are any three-dimensional vectors. (This equation can be proven either through a geometric argument or through an algebraic calculation.)

Suppose v1 and v2 are known polar vectors, and v3 is defined to be their cross product, . If the universe is transformed by a rotation matrix &quot;R&quot;, then v3 is transformed to
:formula_7
So v3 is a pseudovector. Similarly, one can show:
*polar vector × polar vector = pseudovector
*pseudovector × pseudovector = pseudovector
*polar vector × pseudovector = polar vector
*pseudovector × polar vector = polar vector
This is isomorphic to addition modulo 2, where &quot;polar&quot; corresponds to 1 and &quot;pseudo&quot; to 0.

===Examples===

From the definition, it is clear that a displacement vector is a polar vector. The velocity vector is a displacement vector (a polar vector) divided by time (a scalar), so is also a polar vector. Likewise, the momentum vector is the velocity vector (a polar vector) times mass (a scalar), so is a polar vector. Angular momentum is the cross product of a displacement (a polar vector) and momentum (a polar vector), and is therefore a pseudovector. Torque is angular momentum (a pseudovector) divided by time (a scalar), so is also a pseudovector. Continuing this way, it is straightforward to classify any of the common vectors in physics as either a pseudovector or polar vector. (There are the parity-violating vectors in the theory of weak-interactions, which are neither polar vectors nor pseudovectors. However, these occur very rarely in physics.)

==The right-hand rule==

Above, pseudovectors have been discussed using active transformations. An alternate approach, more along the lines of passive transformations, is to keep the universe fixed, but switch &quot;right-hand rule&quot; with &quot;left-hand rule&quot; everywhere in math and physics, including in the definition of the cross product and the curl. Any polar vector (e.g., a translation vector) would be unchanged, but pseudovectors (e.g., the magnetic field vector at a point) would switch signs. Nevertheless, there would be no physical consequences, apart from in the parity-violating phenomena such as certain radioactive decays.

==Formalization==
One way to formalize pseudovectors is as follows: if &quot;V&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space, then a &quot;pseudovector&quot; of &quot;V&quot; is an element of the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-th exterior power of &quot;V&quot;: ⋀&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;V&quot;). The pseudovectors of &quot;V&quot; form a vector space with the same dimension as &quot;V&quot;.

This definition is not equivalent to that requiring a sign flip under improper rotations, but it is general to all vector spaces. In particular, when &quot;n&quot; is even, such a pseudovector does not experience a sign flip, and when the characteristic of the underlying field of &quot;V&quot; is 2, a sign flip has no effect. Otherwise, the definitions are equivalent, though it should be borne in mind that without additional structure (specifically, either a volume form or an orientation), there is no natural identification of ⋀&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;V&quot;) with &quot;V&quot;.

Another way to formalize them is by considering them as elements of a representation space for formula_8. Vectors transform in the fundamental representation of formula_8 with data given by formula_10, so that for any matrix formula_11 in formula_8, one has formula_13. Pseudovectors transform in a pseudofundamental representation formula_14, with formula_15. Another way to view this homomorphism for formula_16 odd is that in this case formula_17. Then formula_18 is a direct product of group homomorphisms; it is the direct product of the fundamental homomorphism on formula_19 with the trivial homomorphism on formula_20.

==Geometric algebra==
In geometric algebra the basic elements are vectors, and these are used to build a hierarchy of elements using the definitions of products in this algebra. In particular, the algebra builds pseudovectors from vectors.

The basic multiplication in the geometric algebra is the geometric product, denoted by simply juxtaposing two vectors as in ab. This product is expressed as:

:formula_21

where the leading term is the customary vector dot product and the second term is called the wedge product or exterior product. Using the postulates of the algebra, all combinations of dot and wedge products can be evaluated. A terminology to describe the various combinations is provided. For example, a multivector is a summation of &quot;k&quot;-fold wedge products of various &quot;k&quot;-values. A &quot;k&quot;-fold wedge product also is referred to as a &quot;k&quot;-blade.

In the present context the &quot;pseudovector&quot; is one of these combinations. This term is attached to a different multivector depending upon the dimensions of the space (that is, the number of linearly independent vectors in the space). In three dimensions, the most general 2-blade or bivector can be expressed as the wedge product of two vectors and is a pseudovector. In four dimensions, however, the pseudovectors are trivectors. In general, it is a -blade, where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of the space and algebra. An &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space has &quot;n&quot; basis vectors and also &quot;n&quot; basis pseudovectors. Each basis pseudovector is formed from the outer (wedge) product of all but one of the &quot;n&quot; basis vectors. For instance, in four dimensions where the basis vectors are taken to be {e1, e2, e3, e4}, the pseudovectors can be written as: {e234, e134, e124, e123}.

===Transformations in three dimensions===
The transformation properties of the pseudovector in three dimensions has been compared to that of the vector cross product by Baylis. He says: &quot;The terms &quot;axial vector&quot; and &quot;pseudovector&quot; are often treated as synonymous, but it is quite useful to be able to distinguish a bivector from its dual.&quot; To paraphrase Baylis: Given two polar vectors (that is, true vectors) a and b in three dimensions, the cross product composed from a and b is the vector normal to their plane given by . Given a set of right-handed orthonormal basis vectors , the cross product is expressed in terms of its components as:

:formula_22

where superscripts label vector components. On the other hand, the plane of the two vectors is represented by the exterior product or wedge product, denoted by . In this context of geometric algebra, this bivector is called a pseudovector, and is the &quot;Hodge dual&quot; of the cross product. The &quot;dual&quot; of e1 is introduced as , and so forth. That is, the dual of e1 is the subspace perpendicular to e1, namely the subspace spanned by e2 and e3. With this understanding,

:formula_23

For details, see &quot;&quot;. The cross product and wedge product are related by:

:formula_24

where is called the &quot;unit pseudoscalar&quot;. It has the property:

:formula_25

Using the above relations, it is seen that if the vectors a and b are inverted by changing the signs of their components while leaving the basis vectors fixed, both the pseudovector and the cross product are invariant. On the other hand, if the components are fixed and the basis vectors eℓ are inverted, then the pseudovector is invariant, but the cross product changes sign. This behavior of cross products is consistent with their definition as vector-like elements that change sign under transformation from a right-handed to a left-handed coordinate system, unlike polar vectors.

===Note on usage===
As an aside, it may be noted that not all authors in the field of geometric algebra use the term pseudovector, and some authors follow the terminology that does not distinguish between the pseudovector and the cross product. However, because the cross product does not generalize to other than three dimensions,
the notion of pseudovector based upon the cross product also cannot be extended to a space of any other number of dimensions. The pseudovector as a -blade in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space is not restricted in this way.

Another important note is that pseudovectors, despite their name, are &quot;vectors&quot; in the sense of being elements of a vector space. The idea that &quot;a pseudovector is different from a vector&quot; is only true with a different and more specific definition of the term &quot;vector&quot; as discussed above.

<text>The River Mersey () is a major river in North West England. Its name derives from Old English and means &quot;boundary river&quot;, possibly referring to its having been a border between the ancient kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. For centuries it has formed part of the boundary between the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire.

The Mersey starts at the confluence of the River Tame and River Goyt in Stockport. It flows westwards through south Manchester, then into the Manchester Ship Canal near Irlam Locks, becoming a part of the canal and maintaining its water levels. After it exits the canal, flowing towards Warrington where it widens. It then narrows as it passes between Runcorn and Widnes. The river widens into a large estuary, which is across at its widest point near Ellesmere Port. The course of the river then turns northwards as the estuary narrows between Liverpool and Birkenhead on the Wirral Peninsula to the west, and empties into Liverpool Bay. In total the river flows .

Part of the Mersey Railway, a rail tunnel between Birkenhead and Liverpool opened in 1886. Two road tunnels pass under the estuary from Liverpool: the Queensway Tunnel opened in 1934 connecting the city to Birkenhead, and the Kingsway Tunnel, opened in 1971, to Wallasey. A road bridge, completed in 1961 and later named the Silver Jubilee Bridge, crosses between Runcorn and Widnes, adjacent to the Runcorn Railway Bridge which opened in 1868. A second road bridge, the Mersey Gateway, opened in October 2017, carrying a six-lane road connecting Runcorn&#x27;s Central Expressway with Speke Road and Queensway in Widnes. The Mersey Ferry operates between Pier Head in Liverpool and Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe, and has become a tourist attraction offering cruises that provide an overview of the river and surrounding areas.

Water quality in the Mersey was severely affected by industrialisation, and in 1985, the Mersey Basin Campaign was established to improve water quality and encourage waterside regeneration. In 2009 it was announced that the river is &quot;cleaner than at any time since the industrial revolution&quot; and is &quot;now considered one of the cleanest in the UK&quot;. The Mersey Valley Countryside Warden Service manages local nature reserves such as Chorlton Ees and Sale Water Park.

The river gave its name to Merseybeat, developed by bands from Liverpool, notably the Beatles. In 1965 it was the subject of the top-ten hit single &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; by Gerry and the Pacemakers.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Mersey&quot; is derived from the Anglo-Saxon , &#x27;of a boundary&#x27; and , &#x27;a river&#x27;. The Mersey was possibly the &#x27;border river&#x27; between Mercia and Northumbria. Its Welsh name is . Prior to Anglo-Saxon conquest of the region, the river was almost certainly known by a Celtic name - recorded by Ptolemy as &quot;Seteia&quot; (as the Southern border of the Brittonic &quot;Setantii&quot; tribe). &quot;Seteia&quot; and &quot;Setantii&quot; both lack clear Celtic roots, leading some to suggest that this was likely a corruption of the actual name. Some, including David Parsons, have suggested the original forms &quot;Segeia&quot; and &quot;Segantii&quot; - based on the root &quot;sego&quot; meaning &quot;strong&quot;. Andrew Breeze instead suggests the original forms &quot;Meteia&quot; and &quot;Metantii&quot; - from &quot;met&quot; meaning &quot;cut&quot; or &quot;harvest&quot; - with the likely meaning being that the Metantii were &quot;reapers (of men), cutters-down (of enemies)&quot;, with the river Meteia meaning &quot;reaping one&quot; or &quot;she that cuts down&quot; (Breeze notes the possibility of a local deity associated with the river, but highlights that this is only a supposition based on known deities like Sulis and Aerfen).

==Course==
The Mersey is formed from three tributaries: the River Etherow, the River Goyt and the River Tame. The modern accepted start of the Mersey is at the confluence of the Tame and Goyt, in central Stockport, Greater Manchester. However, older definitions, and many older maps, place its start a few miles up the Goyt at Compstall; for example the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica states &quot;It is formed by the junction of the Goyt and the Etherow a short distance below Marple in Cheshire on the first-named stream.&quot; The 1784 John Stockdale map shows the River Mersey extending to Mottram, and forming the boundary between Cheshire and Derbyshire. In the west of Stockport it flows at the base of a cliff below the road called Brinksway before reaching flat country. An early Ordnance Survey map indicates the spring at Red Hole on the border of Cheshire and Yorkshire at the head of one of the Etherow&#x27;s longest headwaters, as being the &quot;Source of the River Mersey&quot;.

===Stockport to Warrington===
From Central Stockport the river flows through or past Heaton Mersey, Didsbury, Northenden, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Stretford, Sale, Ashton on Mersey, Urmston and Flixton, where it flows into the Manchester Ship Canal just south of Irlam Locks. At this point the Ship Canal is the canalised section of the River Irwell. The old course of the Mersey has been obliterated by the canal past Hollins Green to Rixton although the old river bed can be seen outside Irlam and at Warburton. At Rixton the River Bollin enters the canal from the south and the Mersey leaves the canal to the north, meandering through Woolston, where the ship canal company&#x27;s dredgings have formed the Woolston Eyes nature reserve, and on to Warrington. 

During the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, the original course of the river through Wilderspool (which is north of Stockton Heath and Lower Walton) was diverted westward into a canalised section. Wilderspool Causeway remains the only remnant of the original eastern bank of the Mersey at this point in Warrington. Part of the original river channel became Warrington Dock (Walton Lock) in the ship canal. 
In the 1960s, the former river channel was filled. The area is now Wilderspool Causeway Park. At the western end of the canalised section in Warrington is the old entrance to the former Runcorn to Latchford Canal. This waterway was abandoned with the construction of the ship canal. It was constructed because the Mersey is tidal from Howley Weir in Warrington. The canal let river traffic reach Warrington during low tides.

During high spring tides, water levels often top the Howley Weir. Before construction of the ship canal, work to improve navigation on the Mersey included Woolston New Cut, bypassing a meander, and Howley Lock for craft to avoid the weir; the new cut and lock are still evident. The island formed between the weir and the lock is known locally as &quot;Monkey Island&quot;.

===Runcorn Gap===

West of Warrington the river widens, and then narrows as it passes through the Runcorn Gap between the towns of Runcorn and Widnes, in Halton. The Manchester Ship Canal passes through the gap to the south of the river. The gap is bridged by the Silver Jubilee Bridge and Runcorn Railway Bridge. Another crossing, the Mersey Gateway road bridge opened in October 2017, and is situated about 1 mile upstream from the Runcorn Gap where the river is considerably wider.

===Estuary===
From the Runcorn Gap, the river widens into a large estuary, which is wide at its widest point near Ellesmere Port. The course of the river then heads north, with Liverpool to the east and the Wirral Peninsula to the west. The Manchester Ship Canal enters the river at Eastham Locks. The eastern part of the estuary is much affected by silting, and part of it is marked on modern maps as dry land rather than tidal. The wetlands are of importance to wildlife, and are listed as a Ramsar site.

Most of the conurbation on both sides of the estuary is known as Merseyside. The estuary narrows between Liverpool and Birkenhead, where it is constricted to a width of , between Albert Dock in Liverpool and the Woodside ferry terminal in Birkenhead. On the Liverpool side, Liverpool Docks stretch for over , the largest enclosed interconnected dock system in the world. American author Herman Melville described Liverpool Docks as being comparable to the pyramids in the vast scale of their construction. The docks were built out into the river bed. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board used granite from a quarry it owned in Scotland for construction of the quays. Birkenhead grew quickly in the 19th century following the introduction of steamships, the earliest being the wooden paddle steamer &quot;Elizabeth&quot; in 1815. Docks were developed along with a shipbuilding industry, flour milling and soap manufacture on the river&#x27;s Cheshire bank.

Seaforth Dock, a freeport on the Liverpool side of the estuary where it meets Liverpool Bay, opened in 1971. The dock deals with around 500,000 containers, over 1.2 million tonnes of oil, over 2.5 million tonnes of grain and animal feed, 452,000 tonnes of wood per year. About 25% of all container traffic between the UK and USA passes through the port making it one of the most successful in the world and known as the &quot;Atlantic Gateway&quot;. Liverpool was the first UK port with radar assisted operations.

The river empties into Liverpool Bay on the Irish Sea, after a total course of . From neap tide to spring tide, the River Mersey has the second highest tidal range in Britain – second only to the River Severn. The narrows in the river estuary between Dingle Point on the Liverpool banks to New Brighton on the Wirral, forces water to flow faster creating a deep channel along the section of river.

For 200 years an admiral was appointed as a conservator to ensure the river remained navigable. Mary Kendrick was the first woman to the post and she had spent years studying a Mersey barrage in the 1980s. 

Taylor&#x27;s Bank is a large sandbank extending out to sea on the north side of the channel entrance to the river on which many ships have come to grief over the years.

==River crossings==

Historically the lowest bridging point on the Mersey was at Warrington where there has been a bridge since medieval times. The first ferry across the estuary was introduced in medieval times by monks from Birkenhead Priory. They transported travellers or accommodated them at the priory in bad weather.

Countless people died on the River Mersey until the advent of safe passage via bridges and tunnels. Many of these deaths were of people who earned their living on the river, either as mariners or dock workers. The majority of mariners to die worked on the Mersey flat boats and drowned due to the weather conditions or poor craft maintenance, although many ordinary civilians perished too. Another ferry existed at Runcorn Gap and by today&#x27;s safety standards was highly dangerous. Passengers had to traverse wooden planks over the mud flats to reach the ferry boats which themselves were often poorly maintained and leaking. Even the steps down to the river bank were described as &quot;beautifully slippery&quot;. In the dark the ferry was particularly worrying as there were few or no lights and the journey was only undertaken on a &quot;needs must&quot; basis. Complaints about the appalling conditions were reported in the local and national press consistently for over 40 years.

In the early 19th century steam operated ferries were introduced. The Mersey Ferry, managed and operated by Merseytravel, operates between Pier Head in Liverpool and Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe. It has become a tourist attraction offering cruises that provide an overview of the river and surrounding areas.

The Mersey Railway completed its tunnel through the estuary&#x27;s underlying Triassic sandstone using manual labour in 1885. Intended as a pneumatic railway, the company opted for steam trains from its opening until it was electrified in 1903. The centre of the running tunnel is between and below the river bed. The railway is now part of the Merseyrail network. Two road tunnels pass under the estuary from Liverpool. By road, the Queensway Tunnel opened in 1934 connecting the city to Birkenhead, and the Kingsway Tunnel, opened in 1971, connects with Wallasey.

Further upstream, the Runcorn Railway Bridge over the river at Runcorn Gap was built in the 1860s for the London and North Western Railway on the mainline between London and Liverpool. It had a cantilevered footway providing an alternative crossing to a ferry. In 1905 the now demolished Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge opened and took cars and passengers via a cable car. The Silver Jubilee Bridge, completed in 1961, is immediately adjacent.

East of Warrington, the M6 motorway crosses the river and the Manchester Ship Canal on the Thelwall Viaduct. When the viaduct opened in 1963, it was the longest motorway bridge in England. A second viaduct alongside opened in 1995; northbound traffic uses the old viaduct and southbound the new.

A new 6-lane bridge, the &quot;Mersey Gateway&quot;, between Runcorn and Widnes began its construction phase in May 2014 and opened just after midnight on 14 October 2017. At the same time the Silver Jubilee Bridge was closed to undergo maintenance for approximately 6–12 months, but will remain open to pedestrians and cyclists. The new bridge uses tolls and the existing Silver Jubilee Bridge will also be tolled.

==Environment==
Water quality in the Mersey was severely affected by industrialisation, and in 1985, the Mersey Basin Campaign was established to improve water quality and encourage waterside regeneration. In 2002, oxygen levels that could support fish along the entire length were recorded for the first time since industry began on the Mersey.

In 2009 it was announced that the river is &quot;cleaner than at any time since the industrial revolution&quot; and is &quot;now considered one of the cleanest [rivers] in the UK&quot;.

===Sediment pollution===
Persistent organic and mercury (Hg) pollution contained within sediments of the Mersey estuary have been evaluated by British Geological Survey. Mersey river sediments from outer to inner estuary (Alfred Dock to Widnes) contain a variety of common organic pollutants, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) with concentrations which fall in the middle of the range of similarly industrial-urban river-estuaries. The distribution of individual PAH compounds suggests that the Mersey has contaminants mainly derived from combustion sources such as vehicle exhaust as well as coal burning. The distribution of the toxic heavy metal Mercury (Hg) has been assessed by measuring 203 sediments taken from shallow cores (0.4 – 1.6 m) extracted from both the main river and adjacent salt marshes. The average amount of Hg in the Mersey was found to be 2 mg/kg with the highest amounts of 5 mg/kg occurring below the surface at concentrations harmful to sediment dwelling biota. The vertical rise and fall in Hg pollution observed at four Mersey salt marshes indicated a decline in metal pollution since the 1980s.

===Fauna===
Salmon have returned to the river and have been seen jumping at Woolston and Howley Weirs between September and November. Salmon parr and smolt have been caught in the Mersey&#x27;s tributaries, the River Goyt and the River Bollin. Atlantic grey seals from Liverpool Bay occasionally venture into the estuary along with bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise. Otter tracks have been observed near Fiddlers Ferry. Other fish in the estuary include cod, whiting, dab, plaice and flounder. Spiny dogfish, mackerel and tope feed on shrimp and whitebait in the estuary. For ducks, the estuary is important to common shelducks and Eurasian teal. Waders include redshank, black-tailed godwit, dunlin, pintail and turnstone.

===Environmental designations===
The section of the estuary between Runcorn Railway Bridge and Bromborough, including Hale Duck Decoy and Mount Manisty, is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, the SSSI citation describing it as an &quot;internationally important site for wildfowl&quot;. There are further SSSIs at New Ferry and Mersey Narrows. The Mersey Estuary, and the Mersey Narrows and North Wirral Foreshore, are also Ramsar sites.

==Navigation==
Capt. William Gill of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, charted a safe, navigable channel (the Victoria Channel) through the treacherous uncharted waters of the estuary in 1836.

Since the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, large commercial vessels do not usually navigate the estuary beyond Garston on the north bank, or the locks into the ship canal at Eastham. Deep-water channels are maintained to both. Until the early 20th century, commercial traffic bound for further upstream carried cargo in large flat-bottomed sailing barges known as Mersey Flats to Howley Wharf in Warrington and (via the Sankey Canal) to St Helens. Motor barges delivered to riverside factories at Warrington until at least the 1970s, but nowadays only pleasure craft and yachts use the upper estuary and the tidal river where a number of sailing clubs are based. On most high tides, seagoing yachts with masts raised can navigate as far upstream as Fiddlers Ferry – about downstream of Warrington – where there is a small marina accessed via a river lock. Although river craft can continue upstream to Howley Weir, there are no landing or mooring facilities. Before construction of the ship canal, a lock bypassing Howley Weir allowed navigation further upstream via a straight &quot;cut&quot; avoiding a meander around Woolston.

==Recreation==
The Mersey Valley Countryside Warden Service manages local nature reserves such as Chorlton Ees and Sale Water Park recreational sites and provides an educational service along the Mersey from Manchester to the Manchester Ship Canal.
It is possible to canoe on parts of the river between Stockport and Carrington. Liverpool Sailing Club located at Garston Coastal Park on the north bank of the estuary has a 1000 feet slipway giving access to river for water sports.

The wooded suburban stretch of the river from above Howley Weir to Woolston is also used for recreational and competitive rowing, operated from the Warrington Rowing Club.

Angling has become popular on some stretches of the river as fish such as perch, barbel, grayling, carp, roach, chub, trout, pike, bream and dace have been caught.
Warrington Anglers Association have fishing rights on a large stretch of the River through most of Warrington. Prince Albert Angling Society also have a small stretch near Rixton.

The river has also faced problems regarding the poaching of fish despite a strict &#x27;catch and release&#x27; policy imposed on anglers for ecological reasons which applies to most UK waterways.

=== Mersey River Festival ===
The Mersey River Festival, rebranded in 2018 as ‘River Festival Liverpool’, was an annual event held on the river Mersey during a weekend in May or June between 1981 and 2019 to celebrate Liverpool&#x27;s maritime tradition. Originally organised by the Merseyside Development Corporation, the festival was later overseen by Liverpool City Council and Culture Liverpool. The last event was planned to take place between the 8 and 10 May 2020, but was cancelled due to COVID. As of 2024, the event has not returned.

During the 1990s the festival was the largest event if its kind in Europe. In the 2010s the event attracted tens of thousands of people and included music stages and other waterside attractions alongside regattas, visiting vessels, and tall ships on the river.

Notable musical artists who have performed at the event include Katie Melua, Shola Ama and Russell Watson. Captain David Hawker was the Mersey River Festival&#x27;s official artist from the late 1990s until the last event in 2019. The painter attended annually to capture on paper the boats, attractions, visitors, and events as they unfolded.

==Mersey barrage==
Proposals continue for the construction of the Mersey Barrage, a tidal scheme to generate electricity and create another crossing of the river. Very high spring tides can generate a tidal bore from Hale as far upstream as Warrington. On 7 December 2022, the Liverpool City Region mayor announced cooperation between the City Region and K-water of South Korea, who built and operates the Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station, in order to construct a similar operation on the River Mersey.

==In popular culture==
The river gave its name to Merseybeat, developed by bands from Liverpool, notably the Beatles. In 1965 it was the subject of the top-ten hit single &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; by Gerry and the Pacemakers, and a musical film of the same name. The Liverpool poets published an anthology of their work, &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot;, in 1967.

The river&#x27;s stretch through Manchester is the main theme in the Stone Roses song &quot;Mersey Paradise&quot;, included on the B-side of the 12&quot; version of their 1989 hit &quot;She Bangs the Drums&quot;, and on their 1992 compilation album &quot;Turns into Stone&quot;.

The Tall ships&#x27; fleet has visited the Mersey on four occasions, first in 1984, then in 1992, 2008 and 2012.

The traditional song &quot;Leaving of Liverpool&quot; mentions the river in its opening line.

==Religious significance==
The Mersey is considered sacred by British Hindus, and worshipped in a similar way to the River Ganges. Festival of Immersion ceremonies are held annually on the river, in which clay figures representing the Hindu Lord Ganesha, the elephant deity riding a mouse, are submerged in the river from a ferry boat. Followers throw flowers, pictures and coins into the river.

<doc id="166358" wikidata="Q852493" url="?curid=166358" title="La Tosca">
<text>La Tosca is a five-act drama by the 19th-century French playwright Victorien Sardou. It was first performed on 24 November 1887 at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin in Paris, with Sarah Bernhardt in the title role. Despite negative reviews from the Paris critics at the opening night, it became one of Sardou&#x27;s most successful plays and was toured by Bernhardt throughout the world in the years following its premiere. The play itself had dropped from the standard theatrical repertoire by the mid-1920s, but its operatic adaptation, Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, has achieved enduring popularity. There have been several other adaptations of the play including two for the Japanese theatre and an English burlesque, &quot;Tra-La-La Tosca&quot; (all of which premiered in the 1890s) as well as several film versions.

&quot;La Tosca&quot; is set in Rome on 17 June 1800 following the French victory in the Battle of Marengo. The action takes place over an eighteen-hour period, ending at dawn on 18 June 1800. Its melodramatic plot centers on Floria Tosca, a celebrated opera singer; her lover, Mario Cavaradossi, an artist and Napoleon sympathiser; and Baron Scarpia, Rome&#x27;s ruthless Regent of Police. By the end of the play, all three are dead. Scarpia arrests Cavaradossi and sentences him to death in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. He then offers to spare her lover if Tosca will yield to his sexual advances. She appears to acquiesce, but as soon as Scarpia gives the order for the firing squad to use blanks, she stabs him to death. On discovering that Cavaradossi&#x27;s execution had in fact been a real one, Tosca commits suicide by throwing herself from the castle&#x27;s parapets.

==Background and premiere==

Victorien Sardou&#x27;s grandfather had served as a surgeon with Napoleon&#x27;s army in Italy, and Sardou retained a lifelong interest in the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars. In addition to &quot;La Tosca&quot;, six of his other plays were set against the events of those times: &quot;Monsieur Garat&quot; (1860), &quot;Les Merveilleuses&quot; (1873), &quot;Thermidor&quot; (1891), &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; (1893), &quot;Robespierre&quot; (1899), and &quot;Pamela&quot; (1898). He was known for the historical research which he used to inform his plays and had a private research library of over 80,000 books including Piranesi&#x27;s etchings of late 18th century Rome, where &quot;La Tosca&quot; is set.

Sardou wrote &quot;La Tosca&quot; specifically for Sarah Bernhardt. She was in her mid-40s by then and France&#x27;s leading actress. In 1883, she had also taken over the lease on the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, where &quot;La Tosca&quot; was to premiere. It was the third play Sardou had written specifically for her. Both their first collaboration, &quot;Fédora&quot; (1882), and their second, &quot;Théodora&quot; (1884), had been highly successful. Pierre Berton, who played Baron Scarpia, had been Bernhardt&#x27;s on and off lover for many years and a frequent stage partner. The elaborate sets for the production were made by a team of designers and painters who had worked with Sardou before: Auguste Alfred Rubé, Philippe Chaperon, Marcel Jambon, Enrico Robecchi, Alfred Lemeunier, and Amable Petit. The costumes were designed by Théophile Thomas, who also designed Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;s costumes for Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Ruy Blas&quot;, Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Cléopâtre&quot; and &quot;Théodora&quot;, and Barbier&#x27;s &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;.

The period leading up to the premiere was not without problems. As had happened before, once word got out of a new Sardou play, another author would accuse him of plagiarism. In the 1882 caricature of Sardou (left), one of the signs on the wall states, (&quot;Ideas of others&quot;) and another, (&quot;Author&#x27;s rights&quot;). This time Ernest Daudet (a brother of Alphonse Daudet) made the accusation, claiming that four years earlier, he and Gilbert-Augustin Thierry had written a play, &quot;Saint Aubin&quot;, which takes place in Paris on the day after the Battle of Marengo (roughly the same time-setting as &quot;La Tosca&quot;) and whose heroine (like Tosca) is a celebrated opera singer. He also claimed that he had read the play to Sarah Bernhardt and Félix Duquesnel, the director of the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin. Nevertheless, he said he would &quot;graciously permit&quot; Sardou&#x27;s play to go ahead, and had brought up the issue solely to avoid being accused of plagiarism should &quot;Saint-Auban&quot; ever be produced. Sardou, in turn, issued a robust denial in the French papers. As the play neared its premiere, Bernhardt discovered to her fury that Sardou had sold the rights for the first American production of the play to the actress Fanny Davenport and threatened to walk out. Bernhardt was eventually pacified and rehearsals continued.

The Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin was packed for the opening night on 24 November 1887, although many in the audience already knew the ending before the curtain went up. While journalists were usually invited to dress-rehearsals, they were expected not to publish details of the play before the premiere. However, the Parisian journal, &quot;Gil Blas&quot;, had published a complete description of the plot on the morning of 24 November. (Following the premiere, Sardou brought a successful suit for damages against the paper.) At the end of the performance, Pierre Berton (Scarpia) came on stage for the customary presentation of the author to the audience. As he began his introduction, a large part of the audience interrupted him shouting, &quot;Bernhardt, Bernhardt!&quot; After three failed attempts, he went backstage and asked Bernhardt to come out. She refused to do so until Sardou had been introduced. Berton finally succeeded, after which Bernhardt appeared to thunderous applause and cries of &quot;Vive Sarah!&quot;

==Characters==

Three minor characters in &quot;La Tosca&quot; are real historical figures: Queen Maria Carolina; Prince Diego Naselli, the Governor of Rome; and the composer, Giovanni Paisiello. However, their treatment in the play is not always historically accurate. On the day the play takes place, Queen Maria Carolina was actually on her way to Austria and staying in Livorno, not Rome. Paisiello was a Neapolitan court composer, but at the time of the play he was under suspicion for anti-Royalist sympathies, making him a highly unlikely candidate for Maria Carolina&#x27;s gathering in Act 2. According to Deborah Burton, another minor character, Princesse Orlonia, is probably based on Princess Torlonia. Although their names and backgrounds contain historical allusions, the four main protagonists, Cesare Angelotti, Mario Cavaradossi, Floria Tosca, and Baron Scarpia are fictional. Their backgrounds are revealed in the conversations between Angelotti and Cavaradossi in Acts 1 and 3.

Cesare Angelotti had been a wealthy landowner in Naples and defender of the short-lived Neapolitan Republic. When it fell to the British forces and Ferdinand IV was returned as ruler, he fled to Rome where he became one of the Consuls of the equally short lived Roman Republic. He is a wanted man, not only for his revolutionary activities but also for a youthful dalliance in London, where he had an eight-day liaison with Emma Hamilton. In those days she had been a prostitute going by the name of Emma Lyon, but by the time of the play she had become the wife of the British Envoy to Naples, William Hamilton, and was a favourite of Queen Maria Carolina. Determined to avoid a scandal, the Queen demanded that he be returned to Naples and hanged. He was languishing in Rome&#x27;s Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, when his sister Giulia, the Marquise Attavanti, helped him to escape. According to historian Susan Vandiver Nicassio, Angelotti was partly based on Liborio Angelucci, who had briefly been a Consul of the Roman Republic, although the resemblance in terms of their life histories ends there. Another influence on the choice of surname may have been Nicola Antonio Angeletti (1791–1870), a prominent Italian revolutionary and member of the Carbonari.

Mario Cavaradossi is descended from an old Roman family, but was born in France, where his father had lived most of his life. The family still had a palazzo on the Piazza di Spagna in Rome and once owned the country villa which Cavaradossi now rents. His father had strong ties with Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert, and his mother was a grand-niece of the French philosopher Helvétius. Cavaradossi studied art in Paris with Jacques-Louis David and lived in David&#x27;s atelier during the French Revolution. When he visited Rome in 1800 to settle his father&#x27;s estate, he met and fell in love with the celebrated opera singer Floria Tosca, and decided to prolong his stay. He soon gained a reputation as a free-thinker and Bonapartist. Even his mustache was suspect. Tosca&#x27;s confessor told her it marked him as a revolutionary. To deflect these suspicions, he offered to do a painting in the church of Sant&#x27;Andrea al Quirinale for free. Nicassio has speculated that one of the influences on Sardou&#x27;s choice of name was the extremely similar name Caravadossi, a noble Italian family from Nice, the birthplace of Garibaldi, and at several points in its history under Italian control. One of the Caravadossi descendants fought in the 19th century Italian Wars of Independence.

Floria Tosca is an orphan from Verona, where she had been found as a child, roaming the hillsides and herding sheep. The Benedictine monks took her in and educated her. The convent organist gave her singing lessons, and by the time she was sixteen, her church performances had made her a local celebrity. The composer Domenico Cimarosa went to hear her and wanted her to go on stage. The monks opposed this, but after she was presented to the Pope, he too declared that she should become an opera singer. Four years later she made her debut in the title role of Paisiello&#x27;s &quot;Nina&quot; and went on to sing at La Scala, La Fenice, and the Teatro San Carlo to great acclaim. When Cavaradossi met her she was singing at the Teatro Argentina in Rome. As soon as her engagement at the theatre was over, she and Cavaradossi planned to leave for Venice, where she had a contract to sing at La Fenice. Sardou took a long time to decide on her name and may have finally been influenced by Saint Tosca, who is particularly revered in Verona. The 8th-century church dedicated to her there is one of the oldest in the Veneto region.

Baron Vitellio Scarpia is from Sicily, where he was known for his ruthless law enforcement. When Naples took control of Rome in 1799, he was appointed the city&#x27;s Regent of Police, and quickly gained a reputation for the cruelty and licentiousness that lay beneath his seemingly courteous exterior. Angelotti characterises him as a religious hypocrite and an &quot;impure satyr&quot; from whom no woman is safe. Before Scarpia set his sights on Floria Tosca, he had tried to force himself on Angelotti&#x27;s sister, who fled from him in terror. According to Nicassio, Sardou may have chosen his name for its similarity to &quot;Sciarpa&quot;, the nickname of Gherardo Curci, a bandit who led irregular troops fighting on behalf of the monarchy in Naples and was made a baron by Ferdinand IV in 1800.

==Synopsis==
===Historical context===
&quot;La Tosca&quot; is set against the background of the French Revolutionary Wars, the establishment of the Roman Republic, and its subsequent fall in 1799 when the French withdrew from Rome. Following the French withdrawal, Rome was controlled by the Kingdom of Naples, supported by the British and Austrians. However, the fighting continued elsewhere in Italy. The French troops had been defeated by the Austrians at the Siege of Genoa on 4 June 1800. Then on 14 June 1800, three days before the play begins, Napoleon&#x27;s troops fought the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo. Although out-numbered, the French were ultimately victorious, despite early reports to the contrary. News of the surprise victory reached Rome on 17 June, the time setting for the play.

===Act 1===
&quot;The church of Sant&#x27;Andrea al Quirinale in Rome on the afternoon of 17 June 1800&quot;

Gennarino (Cavaradossi&#x27;s manservant) and Eusèbe (the sacristan) discuss Cavaradossi&#x27;s relationship with Tosca, his Republican and Bonapartist sympathies, and the apparent defeat of the French army at Marengo. Cavaradossi arrives to work on his painting of Mary Magdalen. When Gennarino and Eusèbe leave, Angelotti, a Republican fugitive who has escaped from the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo emerges from his hiding place in his family&#x27;s chapel. His sister, the Marquise Attavanti, had visited the day before to leave him supplies and women&#x27;s clothes to disguise himself, including a fan to hide his face. Cavaradossi recalls seeing a beautiful blond woman in the church the previous day and tells how she inspired his painting. Tosca arrives and Angelotti quickly returns to his hiding place. Tosca, who is dark-haired, becomes jealous when she sees Cavaradossi&#x27;s painting of a blonde woman, but he reassures her of his love. After she departs, Cavaradossi and Angelotti quickly leave for Cavaradossi&#x27;s country villa. Baron Scarpia and his police enter the church searching for Angelotti. Scarpia finds the fan left by the Marquise Attavanti and keeps it. Worshippers arrive for the &quot;Te Deum&quot; which has been ordered to give thanks for the French defeat.

===Act 2===
&quot;A large chamber in the Farnese Palace on the evening of 17 June 1800&quot;

At the gambling tables, Vicomte de Trévilhac, Capréola, Trevulce and the Marquis Attavanti (all supporters of the Kingdom of Naples), discuss the French defeat at Genoa earlier that month, their apparent defeat at Marengo, and the disappearance of Angelotti and Cavaradossi. Princesse Orlonia and other ladies of the court join them. All discuss the cantata by Paisiello which Tosca will sing later that evening as part of the victory celebrations. Baron Scarpia arrives and there is further discussion of Angelotti&#x27;s escape, cut short by the arrival of Tosca. Queen Marie Caroline enters for the performance of the cantata accompanied by Paisiello, Prince Diego Naselli, courtiers, musicians, Austrian army officers, and monsignors. She reiterates her demand that Scarpia capture Angelotti and have him hanged. Scarpia must now find the fugitive&#x27;s hiding place as quickly as possible. Hoping to provoke Tosca into leading him to Cavaradossi and Angelotti, he takes her aside and shows her the Marquise Attavanti&#x27;s fan, intimating that she and Cavaradossi are lovers. Tosca is overcome with jealousy. As the cantata performance is about to begin, couriers arrive with a letter announcing that the French had been victorious at the Battle of Marengo after all. The Queen faints. Tosca throws the pages of her score into the air and rushes out with her maid. Scarpia orders his men to follow her carriage.
===Act 3===

&quot;Cavaradossi&#x27;s country villa on the night of 17 June 1800&quot;

Cavaradossi tells Angelotti of a chamber in an ancient Roman well on the property where he can hide until he makes his escape. It had been used by one of Cavaradossi&#x27;s ancestors when he fled Rome after stabbing a Medici. Tosca arrives to confront her lover about the fan Scarpia had shown her. Cavaradossi and Angelotti explain everything and she realizes with horror that she has been duped into leading Scarpia to them. On hearing the arrival of Scarpia and his men, Angelotti seeks refuge in the well. Scarpia demands to know where Angelotti is hidden. When Tosca and Cavardossi refuse to tell, Cavaradossi is taken off to be interrogated by the Procureur and tortured by Scarpia&#x27;s assistant if he refuses to answer. Scarpia describes the torture device in great detail to Tosca, who is then made to listen to her lover&#x27;s screams. Unable to bear it any longer, she reveals the hiding place, much to Cavaradossi&#x27;s fury. Rather than be captured, Angelotti takes poison concealed in his ring. Scarpia orders his men to take Cavaradossi to the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo for execution and orders Tosca to be brought there as well.

===Act 4===
&quot;Scarpia&#x27;s apartments in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo in the hours of darkness before the dawn of 18 June 1800&quot;

Scarpia is eating supper in a room lit only by two candles and a candelabrum on his table. There is a prayer stool and a crucifix in an alcove near his bed. He orders Tosca, who has been locked in another room of the castle, to be brought to him. When she arrives, he tells her that Cavaradossi is to be hanged at dawn. He also tells her of his intense attraction to her and offers to spare Cavaradossi if she agrees to sleep with him. Tosca calls him a wild animal and repels his advances in disgust, which only serves to increase his desire. Scarpia then takes her to the window and shows her the scaffold awaiting her lover. Tosca finally says that she will agree to his terms, but only after she has proof that Cavaradossi will be spared. Scarpia calls in Spoletta and in front of Tosca instructs him to stage a mock execution by firing squad with blanks in the riflemen&#x27;s guns. After Spoletta leaves, Tosca demands that Scarpia also give her a document granting safe conduct out of the Roman States. As soon as he signs the document and starts to kiss her, she grabs a knife from the supper table and stabs Scarpia to death. Tosca removes the safe conduct from his hand and starts to leave, but then turns back. She places the two lighted candles on each side of Scarpia&#x27;s body and puts the crucifix on his chest before quietly slipping out of the room. 

===Act 5===
&quot;The chapel at the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo and a platform on the roof of the castle at dawn on 18 June 1800&quot;

Spoletta and his men awaken Cavaradossi in the chapel where he is being held to tell him that he has a visitor. Tosca arrives and rushes into her lover&#x27;s arms. She begs his forgiveness for having revealed Angelotti&#x27;s hiding place, and he in turn asks forgiveness for his anger at the time. She explains that the execution will only be a mock one and they will be able to escape from Rome. Spoletta confirms this and leaves to prepare the firing squad. Alone with Cavaradossi, Tosca tells him that she has killed Scarpia. Spoletta returns to take Cavaradossi to the platform where the firing squad awaits and tells Tosca to remain behind. After a few minutes, Tosca goes out onto the platform and sees Cavaradossi lying on the ground. She turns him over and discovers that he is dead. The bullets were real. Spoletta reveals that he was in fact following Scarpia&#x27;s orders which contained the coded message to shoot him &quot;like we shot Count Palmieri&quot;. Distraught at Scarpia&#x27;s betrayal, Tosca screams &quot;And I cannot even kill him again!&quot; At first Spoletta and Schiarrone think she has gone mad, but an officer arrives and confirms that Scarpia has been murdered. As Spoletta lunges towards her, Tosca climbs onto the castle parapets and throws herself off.

==Performance history==

&quot;La Tosca&quot; had an opening run in Paris of 200 performances. Sarah Bernhardt, along with the original Cavaradossi (Camille Dumény) and Baron Scarpia (Pierre Berton), then starred in the London premiere in July 1888 at the Lyceum Theatre. She would continue to be closely associated with the play until well into the 20th century, touring it around the world from 1889, including performances in Egypt, Turkey, Australia and several countries in Latin America. It was during her 1905 tour to Rio de Janeiro that she injured her leg jumping from the parapets in the final scene. The wound never healed properly and ultimately led to amputation of her leg ten years later. Bernhardt gave the first American performance of &quot;La Tosca&quot; in the original French at New York&#x27;s Garden Theater on 5 February 1891 and took the play to many other American cities, aways performing in French, even though on some occasions, the rest of the cast were performing in English. In Paris, she had revived the play in 1899 to inaugurate the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt where it ran for 57 nights and starred in another major Parisian revival in 1909, six months to the day after Sardou&#x27;s death.

&quot;La Tosca&quot; had its US premiere within four months of its Paris opening, performed in English translation with Fanny Davenport in the title role and her husband, Willet Melbourne MacDowell, as Cavaradossi. The &quot;Davenport Tosca&quot; opened in New York City on 3 March 1888 and inaugurated the luxurious new Broadway Theatre on 41st Street. Davenport had previously bought the rights to the American premiere of Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Féodora&quot;, and had made a fortune from it. She bought the rights to the American premiere of &quot;La Tosca&quot; for 100,0000 francs, before it had even premiered in Paris. As had happened at the Paris premiere, a charge of plagiarism was soon brought. Maurice Barrymore claimed that his 1884 play, &quot;Nadjezda&quot;, had been plagiarised by Sardou and sought an injunction to stop Davenport putting on further performances of &quot;La Tosca&quot;. According to Barrymore, he had given a copy of his play to Sarah Bernhardt in 1885, and she had then given it to Sardou. In affidavits read out in court Bernhardt said that she had never seen the play and knew nothing about it, and Sardou said that preliminary material for the play had been in his desk for fifteen years. In fact, &quot;Nadjezda&quot;&#x27;s only resemblance to &quot;La Tosca&quot; comes from the unholy bargain the heroine makes to save her husband&#x27;s life, similar to that of Tosca and Baron Scarpia. As Sardou pointed out in his affidavit, this plot device is a common one and had been notably used by Shakespeare in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. Davenport herself was in the courtroom on 27 April 1888 when the judge found in her favour. Following the New York run, she toured the play throughout the US with her company.

Tosca remained in Davenport&#x27;s repertoire until the end of her career. After her death in 1898, her husband continued to tour the play with Blanche Walsh in the title role. Other prominent actresses who portrayed Floria Tosca in the play&#x27;s heyday were the British actresses Fanny Bernard-Beere who performed the role in English at London&#x27;s Garrick Theatre in 1889 and Ethel Irving who was still playing the role in 1920; the American actress Cora Urquhart Potter who toured the play in Australia and New Zealand; and the Italian actresses, Teresa Boetti Valvassura and Italia Vivanti (a cousin of Eleonora Duse). After the mid-1920s, revivals of the play became increasingly sporadic. It was performed in Canada by La Comédie de Montréal in 1941 starring Sita Riddez, and an English version adapted by Norman Ginsbury was broadcast on the BBC Home Service in 1958, but by then the play itself had completely disappeared from the standard theatrical repertoire.

==Reception==

Considered by Jerome Hart to be the most emotional of all Sardou&#x27;s plays, &quot;La Tosca&quot;&#x27;s critical reception was in sharp contrast to that of the opening night audience. The Parisian critics roundly attacked the play with Francisque Sarcey calling it a &quot;pantomime&quot;, as did Jules Lemaître. Jules Favre writing in &quot;Les Annales politiques et littéraires&quot; called it a &quot;vulgar piece, without intrigue, without characters, without morals&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent reported the play&#x27;s resounding success with the audience, but like many commentators of the day, including Favre, largely attributed it to Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;s powerful performance, noting that:

There is not much of play, a mere outline at best, made to fit like a glove the talent and personality of Bernhardt who is all and everything, but who should or could complain? The interest never slackens; there is enough dialogue and apropos to keep both gratification and amusement entertained, and the story enobles itself magically in the hands of the greatest living actress.

Writing from the perspective of the late 20th century, Nicassio agrees that Bernhardt&#x27;s performance as a character essentially like herself, a celebrated, amorous, and temperamental diva, was undoubtedly a key factor in the play&#x27;s success with the Paris audience. However, she cites other factors which also played a part: the &quot;exotic&quot; Italian setting with sumptuous sets and costumes, the play&#x27;s anti-clerical themes, and a plot glorifying the Bonapartists as the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution approached.

Following the London premiere in 1888, Cecil Howard wrote that the play was even more popular there than it had been in Paris. Like several critics describing the Paris premiere, he devoted a large part of his review to Bernhardt&#x27;s performance, which he said held the audience &quot;breathless and rapt&quot;, but he had little admiration for Sardou&#x27;s drama:

As to the play itself, I will only add that it is offensive in its morals, corrupt in its teaching, and revolting in its brutality, and yet everyone who admires acting is bound to see it.

The &quot;unchaste&quot; behaviour of the heroine and the violence and brutality depicted in the play, although relatively mild by modern standards, disturbed not only critics at the time, but also some play-goers. The audience&#x27;s reaction to Tosca&#x27;s suicide at the American premiere caused Fanny Davenport to change the ending in subsequent performances with the firing squad taking aim at Tosca while she grieves over Cavaradossi&#x27;s lifeless body, an ending also used by Sarah Bernhardt when she performed the play in Fort Worth, Texas in 1892. William Winter went so far as to warn American women that &quot;La Tosca&quot; contained scenes which were &quot;not only shocking to the nervous system and grossly offensive to persons of true sensibility, but which might inflict irreparable injury on persons yet unborn.&quot; Several early critics, including Arthur Bingham Walkley and Jules Lemaître, wrote at length on Scarpia&#x27;s graphic description of Cavaradossi&#x27;s torture and the sound of his off-stage screams in Act 3, which they considered both gratuitously violent and inartistic. However, this was not a view shared by Oscar Wilde, who found the torture scene moving in its depiction of &quot;a terrible human tragedy&quot;. George Bernard Shaw intensely disliked all of Sardou&#x27;s work, and not surprisingly characterised &quot;La Tosca&quot;, which he saw in London in 1890, as a &quot;clumsily constructed, empty-headed turnip ghost of a cheap shocker&quot;, while presciently suggesting that it would make a good opera.

Despite the views of the critics, &quot;La Tosca&quot; proved to be phenomenally successful. It ultimately had 3000 performances in France alone, played in theatres all over the world for thirty years, and netted Sardou 500,000 francs. Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;s costumes brought Empire silhouette dresses back into style, and the long walking stick she carried in Act 1 became a new fashion accessory. Both a leopard in a famous New York menagerie and an American race horse were named in honour of the play&#x27;s heroine, as were numerous dishes, several of them created by the French chef, Auguste Escoffier, a devotee of Bernhardt.

==Adaptations==

The most famous adaptation of &quot;La Tosca&quot; was Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s Italian opera &quot;Tosca&quot; which premiered in Rome on 14 January 1900 with Hariclea Darclée in the title role and went on to successful premieres in London, New York, and Paris. The Paris premiere at the Opéra-Comique in 1903 was performed in a French translation by Paul Ferrier with Sardou himself taking charge of the rehearsals. Unlike Sardou&#x27;s play, Puccini&#x27;s opera has achieved an enduring popularity. More than 100 years after its premiere, &quot;Tosca&quot; ranks sixth in the list of most frequently performed operas worldwide, and has over 100 commercial recordings as well as several film versions (see Tosca discography). Puccini had seen &quot;La Tosca&quot; in Italy when Bernhardt toured the play there and asked his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, to negotiate with Sardou for the adaptation rights. Before Puccini obtained the rights, the composers Alberto Franchetti and Giuseppe Verdi had both expressed interest in turning &quot;La Tosca&quot; into an opera, although Verdi thought the ending had to be changed. Puccini&#x27;s librettists, Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, likewise tried (unsuccessfully) to convince Sardou to accept a new ending, with Tosca going mad rather than committing suicide. The Sardou ending stayed, but Illica and Giacosa did make several significant changes to the play, primarily to tighten the action.

Earlier, &quot;La Tosca&quot; had been adapted into an English novel by Arthur D. Hall in 1888, and had two adaptations for traditional Japanese theatre, both performed in 1891. In the Japanese adaptations, the famed story-teller, San&#x27;yūtei Enchō, set the work during the period of the 1837 rebellion by Ōshio Heihachirō, while Fukuchi Gen&#x27;ichirō adapted the play for Kabuki theatre. There were at least four silent film adaptations. A hand-coloured version starring Sarah Bernhardt was made in 1906 by Le Film d&#x27;Art, a French film company run by André Calmettes and Charles le Bargy. Bernhardt was so displeased with her performance that she refused to allow its release and tried to buy up and destroy all the negatives. Le Bargy and Calmettes then re-filmed the work, this time with Cécile Sorel as Tosca, and released it in 1908. The Bernhardt version re-surfaced and was released in 1912 by Universal Pictures. There was also a 1918 version by Paramount Pictures with Pauline Frederick as Tosca. Only fragments remain of the Italian film made the same year starring Francesca Bertini. Later films tended to be adaptations of Puccini&#x27;s opera rather than Sardou&#x27;s play with the notable exception of Carl Koch&#x27;s 1941 Italian film &quot;Tosca&quot; starring Imperio Argentina as Tosca and Rossano Brazzi as Cavaradossi. Jean Renoir originally worked with Koch on the adaptation, but had to leave Italy at the outbreak of World War II. The film was released in the US in 1947 as &quot;The Story of Tosca&quot;.

Shortly after the first London performances of &quot;La Tosca&quot;, Francis Burnand and the composer Florian Pascal wrote a musical parody of the play entitled &quot;Tra-la-la Tosca or The High-Toned Soprano and the Villain Bass&quot;. In their burlesque version, Tosca murders Scarpia in the &quot;Cafe Romano allo Strando&quot;, stabbing him with a huge rolled-up restaurant bill and then places one of the dish covers over his face. Cavaradossi, instead, is executed by a phalanx of photographers. The show premiered at London&#x27;s Royalty Theatre in January 1890 and ran for 45 performances, with the critic Cecil Howard pronouncing it one of Burnand&#x27;s finest efforts. Burnand had previously parodied Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Féodora&quot; as &quot;Stage-Doora&quot; (1883) and &quot;Théodora&quot; as &quot;The O&#x27;Dora&quot; (1885), both of which ran at Toole&#x27;s Theatre in London. In 2004, Lucio Dalla composed an Italian musical, &quot;Tosca, Amore Disperato&quot; (&quot;Tosca, Desperate Love&quot;), based largely on the structure of Puccini&#x27;s opera, but with elements from Sardou&#x27;s play. The setting was updated to modern times with costumes by Giorgio Armani. &quot;Tosca, Amore Disperato&quot; continues to be performed in Italy and was broadcast on RAI television in June 2010.
===Differences between Sardou&#x27;s play and Puccini&#x27;s opera===
The number of characters is sharply reduced in the opera, and the work shortened to three acts, leaving out much of the political motivations of the protagonists. In the opera, Angelotti and Cavaradossi already know each other. In the play, they had never met before, thus allowing considerable scope to explain their histories and backgrounds to each other. The roles of Tosca&#x27;s maid and Cavaradossi&#x27;s two servants were eliminated as were most of the characters in Act 2, although some of them such as the Marquis Attavanti and Queen Maria Carolina are alluded to in the opera. The gathering at the Farnese Palace in the presence of Queen Maria Carolina, Act 2 of the play, was eliminated. The setting of Act 2 and the events of Acts 3 and 4 in the play were then combined into the second act of the opera, which involved several significant changes. 

Unlike the play, Scarpia shows Tosca the Marquise Attavanti&#x27;s fan in Act 1, where Puccini&#x27;s librettists contrive to have her return to the church following the departure of Angelotti and Cavaradossi. In the opera, both Cavaradossi&#x27;s interrogation and torture and Scarpia&#x27;s subsequent murder take place in the Farnese Palace. In the play, Cavaradossi&#x27;s interrogation is set at his country house, where he was captured, while Scarpia&#x27;s murder takes place at his apartment in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. The news of the Austrian defeat at Marengo which formed the climax of Act 2 in &quot;La Tosca&quot; does not emerge in the opera until after Cavaradossi has been captured and tortured. Thus Scarpia is able to listen to Tosca&#x27;s uninterrupted performance of the cantata (heard in a distant room of the palace).

Early audiences (especially in the United States and Britain) sometimes balked at the realism in Sardou&#x27;s play, especially Cavaradossi&#x27;s screams while he is being tortured off-stage. In Puccini&#x27;s version, his screams are likewise heard by the audience. However his death by firing squad is even more explicit, occurring on stage in full view of the audience, rather than off stage as in the play. Tosca&#x27;s final words before committing suicide in the play are addressed to Spoletta and his men. When he vows to send her to join her lover, she cries (&quot;I am going, scoundrels!&quot;). In the opera, her final words are addressed to Scarpia: (&quot;O Scarpia, [we meet] before God!&quot;). The opera also gives Cavaradossi a soliloquy in the final act, &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot; (&quot;And the stars were shining&quot;), in which he reflects on his past happiness with Tosca and his impending death. Other relatively minor changes include Puccini&#x27;s addition of a singing shepherd boy as Cavaradossi awaits his execution and a change of the church in Act 1 from Sardou&#x27;s Sant&#x27;Andrea al Quirinale to Puccini&#x27;s Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle. The latter actually has a potential hiding place for Angelotti. Its Barberini chapel incorporates a shallow chamber separated from the main part of the chapel by a grille.

<text>Bohai Bay () is one of the three major bays of the Bohai Sea, the northwestern and innermost gulf of the Yellow Sea. It is bounded by the coastlines of eastern Hebei province (Tangshan and Cangzhou), Tianjin municipality and northern Shandong province (Binzhou and Dongying) south of the Daqing River estuary (which is an old mouth of Luan River in Laoting County) and north of the Yellow River estuary. It is the most southerly water in the northern hemisphere where sea ice can form.

The Bohai Bay is the drainage destination of the Hai River and 15 other rivers. Due to these rivers&#x27; muddy runoff, the bay used to be a highly silty water body, but extensive damming of the various river systems has greatly diminished siltage. Nevertheless, the Bohai Bay in effect concentrates the runoff of the whole eastern North China Plain, and the Bay is an intensely polluted body of water. Reduced silt deposition and sea level rise are causing problems with sea encroachment in some coastal areas. 

Fisheries were traditionally some of the richest in China, fed by enormous sediment runoff and extensive shallows to serve as hatcheries. Pollution, eutrophication, habitat destruction caused by land reclamation, and intense overfishing have resulted in a collapse of stocks, and a decline of trawl catch per unit of effort (CPUE) from 138.8 kg/net.hr to 11.2 kg/net.hr from 1959 to 1998.

The Bohai Bay is ringed by several major ports: the Port of Tianjin, the large Port of Tangshan itself which consists of three ports (Caofeidian, Jingtang and Fennan), and the Port of Huanghua, making the Bay into a very crowded waterway. Land reclamation in Tianjin and in Caofeidian have greatly changed the littoral zone, and destroyed much of the area&#x27;s wetlands. Land reclamation has also affected migratory birds.

As is the case of most of the Bohai Sea, the Bohai Bay is rich in hydrocarbon deposits and has several active offshore oil fields. Jidong Nanpu contains , while the bay as a whole is estimated to contain . On June 4, 2011, a large oil spill occurred related to the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.

<doc id="166362" wikidata="Q178812" url="?curid=166362" title="Tubular bells">
<text>Tubular bells (also known as chimes) are musical instruments in the percussion family. Their sound resembles that of church bells, carillons, or a bell tower; the original tubular bells were made to duplicate the sound of church bells within an ensemble. Each bell is a metal tube, in diameter, tuned by altering its length. Its standard range is C4–F5, though many professional instruments reach G5. Tubular bells are often replaced by studio chimes, which are smaller and usually less expensive instruments. Studio chimes are similar in appearance to tubular bells, but each bell has a smaller diameter than the corresponding bell on tubular bells.

Tubular bells are sometimes struck on the top edge of the tube with a rawhide- or plastic-headed hammer. Often, a sustain pedal will be attached to allow extended ringing of the bells. They can also be bowed at the bottom of the tube to produce a very loud, very high-pitched overtone.

The tubes provide a purer tone than solid cylindrical chimes, such as those on a mark tree.

Chimes are often found in orchestral and concert band repertoire. It rarely plays melody, instead being used most often as a color to add to the ensemble sound. It does have solos occasionally, often depicting church bells.

In tubular bells, modes 4, 5, and 6 appear to determine the strike tone and have frequencies in the ratios 92:112:132, or 81:121:169, &quot;which are close enough to the ratios 2:3:4 for the ear to consider them nearly harmonic and to use them as a basis for establishing a virtual pitch&quot;. The perceived &quot;strike pitch&quot; is thus an octave below the fourth mode (i.e., the missing &quot;1&quot; in the above series).

==Classical music==
Tubular bells first appeared between 1860 and 1870 in Paris.
The Englishman John Harrington patented tubular bells made of bronze. Arthur Sullivan may have been the first composer to score for tubular bells in the orchestra, in 1886. 
In the early 20th century tubular bells were also incorporated into theater organs to produce effects.

Tubular bells as a substitute for church bells were first used by Giuseppe Verdi in his operas Il trovatore (1853) and Un ballo in maschera (1859) and by Giacomo Puccini in Tosca (1900).

==In popular music==
Multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield named his first album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, best known for providing the musical theme to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; film (1973). At the beginning of his solo symphony recording project in 1972, Oldfield discovered a set of tubular bells at The Manor Studio in Oxfordshire, England, and asked new owner Richard Branson for permission to use them. The chimes were played by Oldfield on parts of the album, and they supplied the album name. Branson&#x27;s company Virgin Records benefitted tremendously as Oldfield&#x27;s album sold millions of copies; this also contributed to Branson&#x27;s personal wealth and industry leverage.

==Other uses==
Tubular bells can be used as church bells, such as at St. Alban&#x27;s Anglican Church in Copenhagen, Denmark. These were donated by Charles, Prince of Wales.

Tubular bells are also used in longcase clocks, particularly because they produce a louder sound than gongs and regular chime-rods and therefore could be heard more easily.

<doc id="166365" wikidata="Q3730817" url="?curid=166365" title="Vorticity equation">
<text>The vorticity equation of fluid dynamics describes the evolution of the vorticity of a particle of a fluid as it moves with its flow; that is, the local rotation of the fluid (in terms of vector calculus this is the curl of the flow velocity). The governing equation is:where is the material derivative operator, is the flow velocity, is the local fluid density, is the local pressure, is the viscous stress tensor and represents the sum of the external body forces. The first source term on the right hand side represents vortex stretching.

The equation is valid in the absence of any concentrated torques and line forces for a compressible, Newtonian fluid. In the case of incompressible flow (i.e., low Mach number) and isotropic fluids, with conservative body forces, the equation simplifies to the vorticity transport equation:
:formula_1
where is the kinematic viscosity and formula_2 is the Laplace operator. Under the further assumption of two-dimensional flow, the equation simplifies to:
:formula_3

==Physical interpretation==

* The term on the left-hand side is the material derivative of the vorticity vector . It describes the rate of change of vorticity of the moving fluid particle. This change can be attributed to unsteadiness in the flow (, the &quot;unsteady term&quot;) or due to the motion of the fluid particle as it moves from one point to another (, the &quot;convection term&quot;).
* The term on the right-hand side describes the stretching or tilting of vorticity due to the flow velocity gradients. Note that is a vector quantity, as is a scalar differential operator, while is a nine-element tensor quantity.
* The term describes stretching of vorticity due to flow compressibility. It follows from the Navier-Stokes equation for continuity, namely formula_4 where is the specific volume of the fluid element. One can think of as a measure of flow compressibility. Sometimes the negative sign is included in the term.
* The term is the baroclinic term. It accounts for the changes in the vorticity due to the intersection of density and pressure surfaces.
* The term , accounts for the diffusion of vorticity due to the viscous effects.
* The term provides for changes due to external body forces. These are forces that are spread over a three-dimensional region of the fluid, such as gravity or electromagnetic forces. (As opposed to forces that act only over a surface (like drag on a wall) or a line (like surface tension around a meniscus).

=== Simplifications ===
* In case of conservative body forces, .
* For a barotropic fluid, . This is also true for a constant density fluid (including incompressible fluid) where . Note that this is not the same as an incompressible flow, for which the barotropic term cannot be neglected. 
** This note seems to be talking about the fact that conservation of momentum says and there&#x27;s a difference between assuming that ρ=constant (the &#x27;incompressible fluid&#x27; option, above) and that formula_5 (the &#x27;incompressible flow&#x27; option, above). With the first assumption, conservation of momentum implies (for non-zero density) that formula_5; whereas the second assumption doesn&#x27;t necessary imply that ρ is constant. This second assumption only strictly requires that the time rate of change of the density is compensated by the gradient of the density, as in:. You can make sense of this by considering the ideal gas law (which is valid if the Reynolds number is large enough that viscous friction becomes unimportant.) Then, even for an adiabatic, chemically-homogenous fluid, the density can vary when the pressure changes, e.g. with Bernoulli.
* For inviscid fluids, the viscosity tensor is zero.

Thus for an inviscid, barotropic fluid with conservative body forces, the vorticity equation simplifies to
: formula_7

Alternately, in case of incompressible, inviscid fluid with conservative body forces, 
: formula_8

For a brief review of additional cases and simplifications, see also. For the vorticity equation in turbulence theory, in context of the flows in oceans and atmosphere, refer to.

==Derivation==
The vorticity equation can be derived from the Navier–Stokes equation for the conservation of angular momentum. In the absence of any concentrated torques and line forces, one obtains:

:formula_9

Now, vorticity is defined as the curl of the flow velocity vector; taking the curl of momentum equation yields the desired equation. The following identities are useful in derivation of the equation:
:formula_10

where formula_11 is any scalar field.

==Tensor notation==
The vorticity equation can be expressed in tensor notation using Einstein&#x27;s summation convention and the Levi-Civita symbol :

:formula_12

==In specific sciences==

===Atmospheric sciences===
In the atmospheric sciences, the vorticity equation can be stated in terms of the absolute vorticity of air with respect to an inertial frame, or of the vorticity with respect to the rotation of the Earth. The absolute version is

:formula_13

Here, is the polar () component of the vorticity, is the atmospheric density, , , and w are the components of wind velocity, and is the 2-dimensional (i.e. horizontal-component-only) del.

<text>Mulled wine, also known as spiced wine, is an alcoholic drink usually made with red wine, along with various mulling spices and sometimes raisins, served hot or warm. It is a traditional drink during winter, especially around Christmas. It is usually served at Christmas markets in Europe, primarily in Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, Northern Italy,Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, the Nordic countries, the Baltic countries, Great Britain and France. There are non-alcoholic versions of it.

==Origins==

The first record of wine being spiced and heated can be found in Plautus&#x27; play &quot;Curculio&quot;, written during the 2nd century BC. The Romans travelled across Europe, conquering much of it and trading with the rest. The legions brought wine and viticulture with them up to the Rhine and Danube rivers and to the Scottish border, along with their recipes.

The Forme of Cury, a medieval English cookery book from 1390, which mentioned mulled wine, says: &quot;Pur fait Ypocras ...&quot; grinding together cinnamon, ginger, galangal, cloves, long pepper, nutmeg, marjoram, cardamom, and grains of paradise (&quot;spykenard de Spayn&quot;, rosemary may be substituted). This is mixed with red wine and sugar (form and quantity unstated).

==Britain==
Mulled wine is very popular and traditional in the United Kingdom at Christmas, and less commonly throughout winter. Mulled cider (and sometimes mulled ale, traditional yet no longer common) is also served, with a mulled apple juice as a non-alcoholic alternative.

===In traditional culture===
Over the years the recipe for mulled wine has evolved with the tastes and fashions of the time. One Victorian example of this is smoking bishop, mentioned by Charles Dickens but no longer drunk or known in modern culture. A more traditional recipe can be found in &quot;Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; at paragraph 1961 on page 929 to 930 of the revised edition dated 1869:


===In contemporary culture===
In contemporary British culture, there is no specific recipe for mulled wine and the spices involved in its recipe. It is commonly a combination of orange, lemon, cinnamon, nutmeg, fennel seed (or star anise), cloves, cardamom, and ginger. The spices may be combined and boiled in a sugar syrup before red wine is added, heated, and served. Variations include adding brandy or ginger wine. A tea bag of spices can be added to the wine, which is heated along with slices of orange as a convenient alternative to a full recipe. Mulled wine is often served in small (200 ml) porcelain or glass mugs, sometimes with an orange slice garnish studded with cloves.

Mulled wine and ales infused with mulling spices are available in the UK in the winter months. Wassail punch is a warm mulled beer or cider drunk in winter in Victorian times.

==&quot;Glühwein&quot;==
&quot;Glühwein&quot; (roughly translated as &#x27;glowing-wine&#x27;, from the temperature the wine is heated to) is popular in German-speaking countries, the Germany-bordering Alsace region of France, and to a lesser extent Russia. It is a traditional beverage offered during the Christmas holidays. In Alsace Christmas markets, it is traditionally the only alcoholic beverage served. The oldest documented &quot;Glühwein&quot; tankard is attributed to Count John IV of Katzenelnbogen, a German nobleman who was the first grower of Riesling grapes. This gold-plated lockable silver tankard is dated to .

&quot;Glühwein&quot; is usually prepared from red wine, heated and spiced with cinnamon sticks, cloves, star aniseed, orange, sugar and at times vanilla pods. It is sometimes drunk &quot;mit Schuss&quot; (with a shot), which means that rum or some other liquor has been added. Fruit wines, such as blueberry wine and cherry wine, are occasionally used instead of grape wine in some parts of Germany. A variation of &quot;Glühwein&quot; is made with white wine, but it is less popular than its red counterpart. For children, the non-alcoholic &quot;Kinderpunsch&quot; is offered on Christmas markets, which is a punch with similar spices.
Another popular variant of &quot;Glühwein&quot; in Germany is &quot;Feuerzangenbowle&quot;. It shares the same recipe, but for this drink a rum-soaked sugarloaf is set on fire and allowed to drip into the wine. Polish type of &quot;Glühwein&quot; is called &quot;Grzaniec&quot;. It is similar to the German one with one exception—it is usually sweetened with honey instead of sugar.

==Nordic &quot;glögg&quot;==

&quot;Glögg&quot;, &quot;gløgg&quot;, &quot;glögi&quot; and similar words are the terms used for mulled wine in the Nordic countries and Estonia (sometimes spelled as &quot;glog&quot; or &quot;glug&quot;). It is spelled &quot;gløgg&quot; in Norwegian, Danish and Faroese, &quot;glögg&quot; in Swedish and Icelandic and &quot;glögi&quot; in Finnish and Estonian. In Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland &quot;gløgg&quot; or &quot;glögg&quot; is often drunk at Christmas events.

Non-alcoholic and alcoholic versions of &quot;glögg&quot; can be bought ready-made or prepared with fruit juices instead of wine. The main ingredients of alcoholic &quot;glögg&quot; are red wine, sugar, spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and bitter orange, and optionally also stronger spirits such as vodka, akvavit, rum or brandy. Throughout Scandinavia, &quot;glögg&quot; spice extract and ready-mixed spices can be purchased in grocery stores. To prepare &quot;glögg&quot;, spices or spice extract are mixed into the wine, which is then heated to 60–70 °C. When preparing homemade &quot;glögg&quot; using spices, the hot mixture is allowed to infuse for at least an hour, often longer, and then reheated before serving. Ready-made wine &quot;glögg&quot;, as well as low- or non-alcoholic varieties, is normally sold at Systembolaget in Sweden, and in Alko in Finland, ready to heat and serve, and not in concentrate or extract form. &quot;Glögg&quot; is generally served with raisins, dried cloves, blanched almonds and ginger biscuits (gingerbread cookies), and is a popular hot drink during the Christmas season.

In Sweden, ginger bread and &quot;lussebullar&quot; (also called &quot;lussekatter&quot;), a type of sweet bun with saffron and raisins, are typically served on December 13 to celebrate Saint Lucia&#x27;s Day. It is also traditionally served at the julbord, the Christmas version of the classic, Swedish buffet smörgåsbord. In Denmark, &quot;gløgg&quot; pairings typically include æbleskiver sprinkled with powdered sugar and accompanied with strawberry marmalade. In Norway, &quot;gløgg&quot; is paired with risengrynsgrøt (rice pudding). In such cases, the word &quot;graut-&quot;/&quot;grøtfest&quot; is more precise, taking the name from the rice pudding which is served as a course. Typically, &quot;gløgg&quot; is drunk before eating the rice pudding, which is often served with cold, red cordial (saus).

&quot;Glögg&quot; recipes vary widely; variations with white wine or sweet wine such as Port or Madeira, or spirits such as brandy, schnapps or whisky are also popular, either added directly or by soaking the raisins and spice in them before preparing the drink (often resulting in a notable increase in the alcohol contents). &quot;Glögg&quot; can also be made without alcohol by replacing the wine with fruit or berry juices (often blackcurrant) or by boiling the &quot;glögg&quot; to evaporate the alcohol. &quot;Glögg&quot; is similar in taste to modern Wassail or mulled cider.

==Other countries==
In Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, &quot;kuhano vino&quot; or &quot;kuvano vino&quot; (, ), is made from red or white wine and various combinations of nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, aniseed sugar/honey or orange zest, often served with slices of orange or lemon. In North Macedonia, it is called &quot;vareno vino&quot; (, &#x27;boiled wine&#x27;) or &quot;greeno vino&quot; (, &#x27;heated wine&#x27;) and is usually served in late autumn or winter. It is made of red wine, usually from the Tikveš region, combined with cinnamon and sugar or honey. The wine, heated in combination with pepper, is used as a folk remedy for cold and flu.

In the south and southeast of Brazil, it is called &quot;vinho quente&quot; or &quot;quentão&quot;, from the same Portuguese drink. It is typically made with red wine, cinnamon sticks and cloves. &quot;Cachaça&quot; may be added to increase the alcohol content. It is served as part of the Festa Junina, celebrated during winter in the month of June.

In Bulgaria, it is called &quot;greyano vino&quot; (, &#x27;heated wine&#x27;), and consists of red wine, honey and peppercorn. Sometimes apples or citrus fruits, such as lemon or oranges, can be added.

In Chile, it is called &quot;candola&quot; in the south and &quot;vino navega&#x27;o&quot; in the north (&quot;navegado&quot;, ; &#x27;navigated&#x27; is considered a hypercorrection). Navega&#x27;o is a hot drink made from red wine, orange peels, cinnamon sticks, cloves, and sugar. Although being considered a southern Chile beverage, it is served throughout the country. Many people regard it as a winter drink. Saint John&#x27;s Eve (Spanish tradition which replaced &quot;Wetripantru&quot;, the Mapuche New Year&#x27;s Day that coincides with the Winter Solstice in the southern hemisphere—Midsummer in the northern hemisphere) on the evening of 23 June would be, for example, a good time to drink &quot;navega&#x27;o&quot;.

In the Czech Republic, mulled wine is called &quot;svařené víno&quot; (&#x27;boiled wine&#x27;), colloquially &quot;svařák&quot;. In Slovakia, mulled wine is called &quot;varené víno&quot; (&#x27;boiled wine&#x27;), and is usually served during the Christmas season.

In France, &quot;vin chaud&quot; (&#x27;hot wine&#x27;) typically consists of red wine mixed with honey, cinnamon, and orange. It must not be too sweet. Beverage noted in the Alps for winter sports. In Geneva, Switzerland, &quot;vin chaud&quot; is consumed during the festivities surrounding L&#x27;Escalade.

In Hungary, &quot;forralt bor&quot; (&#x27;boiled wine&#x27;) is typically made from the country&#x27;s popular Egri Bikavér and spiced with cinnamon, sugar and cloves. Sometimes Amaretto is added for extra taste.

In Italy, mulled wine is typical in the northern part of the country and is called &quot;vin brülé&quot; (from the French &quot;vin brûlé&quot;, &#x27;burnt wine&#x27;, though the expression is not used in France).

In Latvia, it is called &quot;karstvīns&quot; (&#x27;hot wine&#x27;). When out of wine, it is prepared using grape (or currant) juice and Riga Black Balsam. In Lithuania, it is called &quot;glintveinas&quot; or &quot;karštas vynas&quot; (&#x27;hot wine&#x27;).

In Romania, &quot;vin fiert&quot; is typically made with cinnamon, sugar and oranges. Red wine is the most common type but white wine is also used. In Moldova &quot;vin fiert&quot; is made from red wine with black pepper and honey.

In the Netherlands and Belgium, the drink is known as &quot;bisschopswijn&quot; (&#x27;bishop&#x27;s wine&#x27;). &quot;Bisschopswijn&quot; is drunk during the Sinterklaas holidays.

In Poland, &quot;grzane wino&quot; (&#x27;heated wine&#x27;), or &quot;grzaniec&quot; in highlander dialect, is very similar to the Czech variant, especially in the southern regions. There is also a similar method for preparing mulled beer, or &quot;grzane piwo&quot;, which is popular with Belgian beers because of the sweet flavor of that particular type of beer, which uses the same spices as mulled wine and is heated. Vodka-spiked mulled wine can be found in Polish Christmas markets, where mulled wine is used as a mixer.

In Portugal, mainly in the Douro and Minho Provinces, it is called &quot;vinho quente&quot; and made with Madeira wine and port wine, in the Porto region Porto Quente is more popular.

In Russia and Ukraine, &quot;glintveyn&quot; () is a popular drink during winters and has same recipe as the German &quot;Glühwein&quot;. Russian () is a historical analogue of mulled wine. Additionally, the traditional Russian winter herbal drink &quot;sbiten&quot;, although usually a non-alcoholic tisane made with hot water, may also be made with red wine replacing some or all of the water.

==In popular culture==
In the 1946 Christmas movie &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, after the 293-year old guardian angel Clarence Odbody (traveling with George Bailey to an alternate world if George had not been born) goes to a rough bar. And, not knowing what to order since he had not been to a bar in centuries, decides to order, &quot;I was just thinking of a flaming rum punch. No, it&#x27;s not cold enough for that. Not nearly cold enough…Wait a minute…wait a minute…Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves. Off with you, me lad, and be lively!&quot;

<doc id="166371" wikidata="Q1548585" url="?curid=166371" title="Baroclinity">
<text>In fluid dynamics, the baroclinity (often called baroclinicity) of a stratified fluid is a measure of how misaligned the gradient of pressure is from the gradient of density in a fluid. In meteorology a baroclinic flow is one in which the density depends on both temperature and pressure (the fully general case). A simpler case, barotropic flow, allows for density dependence only on pressure, so that the curl of the pressure-gradient force vanishes.

Baroclinity is proportional to:

:formula_1

which is proportional to the sine of the angle between surfaces of constant pressure and surfaces of constant density. Thus, in a &quot;barotropic&quot; fluid (which is defined by zero baroclinity), these surfaces are parallel.

In Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, barotropic flow is a better approximation in the tropics, where density surfaces and pressure surfaces are both nearly level, whereas in higher latitudes the flow is more baroclinic. These midlatitude belts of high atmospheric baroclinity are characterized by the frequent formation of synoptic-scale cyclones, although these are not really dependent on the baroclinity term &quot;per se&quot;: for instance, they are commonly studied on pressure coordinate iso-surfaces where that term has no contribution to vorticity production.

==Baroclinic instability==

Baroclinic instability is a fluid dynamical instability of fundamental importance in the atmosphere and in the oceans. In the atmosphere it is the principal mechanism shaping the cyclones and anticyclones that dominate weather in mid-latitudes. In the ocean it generates a field of mesoscale eddies (100 km or smaller) that play various roles in oceanic dynamics and the transport of tracers.

Whether a fluid counts as &quot;rapidly rotating&quot; is determined in this context by the Rossby number, which is a measure of how close the flow is to solid body rotation. More precisely, a flow in solid body rotation has vorticity that is proportional to its angular velocity. The Rossby number is a measure of the departure of the vorticity from that of solid body rotation. The Rossby number must be small for the concept of baroclinic instability to be relevant. When the Rossby number is large, other kinds of instabilities, often referred to as inertial, become more relevant.

The simplest example of a stably stratified flow is an incompressible flow with density decreasing with height.

In a compressible gas such as the atmosphere, the relevant measure is the vertical gradient of the entropy, which must increase with height for the flow to be stably stratified.

The strength of the stratification is measured by asking how large the vertical shear of the horizontal winds has to be in order to destabilize the flow and produce the classic Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. This measure is called the &quot;Richardson number&quot;. When the Richardson number is large, the stratification is strong enough to prevent this shear instability.
Before the classic work of Jule Charney and Eric Eady on baroclinic instability in the late 1940s, most theories trying to explain the structure of mid-latitude eddies took as their starting points the high Rossby number or small Richardson number instabilities familiar to fluid dynamicists at that time. The most important feature of baroclinic instability is that it exists even in the situation of rapid rotation (small Rossby number) and strong stable stratification (large Richardson&#x27;s number) typically observed in the atmosphere.

The energy source for baroclinic instability is the potential energy in the environmental flow. As the instability grows, the center of mass of the fluid is lowered. 
In growing waves in the atmosphere, cold air moving downwards and equatorwards displaces the warmer air moving polewards and upwards.

Baroclinic instability can be investigated in the laboratory using a rotating, fluid filled annulus. The annulus is heated at the outer wall and cooled at the inner wall, and the resulting fluid flows give rise to baroclinically unstable waves.

The term &quot;baroclinic&quot; refers to the mechanism by which vorticity is generated. Vorticity is the curl of the velocity field. In general, the evolution of vorticity can be broken into contributions from advection (as vortex tubes move with the flow), stretching and twisting (as vortex tubes are pulled or twisted by the flow) and baroclinic vorticity generation, which occurs whenever there is a density gradient along surfaces of constant pressure. Baroclinic flows can be contrasted with barotropic flows in which density and pressure surfaces coincide and there is no baroclinic generation of vorticity.

The study of the evolution of these baroclinic instabilities as they grow and then decay is a crucial part of developing theories for the fundamental characteristics of midlatitude weather.

==Baroclinic vector==
Beginning with the equation of motion for a frictionless fluid (the Euler equations) and taking the curl, one arrives at the equation of motion for the curl of the fluid velocity, that is to say, the vorticity.

In a fluid that is not all of the same density, a source term appears in the vorticity equation whenever surfaces of constant density (isopycnic surfaces) and surfaces
of constant pressure ( surfaces) are not aligned. The material derivative of the local vorticity is given by:

:formula_2

(where formula_3 is the velocity and formula_4 is the vorticity, formula_5 is the pressure, and formula_6 is the density). The baroclinic contribution is the vector:

: formula_7

This vector, sometimes called the solenoidal vector, is of interest both in compressible fluids and in incompressible (but inhomogeneous) fluids. Internal gravity waves as well as unstable Rayleigh–Taylor modes can be analyzed from the perspective of the baroclinic vector. It is also of interest in the creation of vorticity by the passage of shocks through inhomogeneous media, such as in the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability.

Experienced divers are familiar with the very slow waves that can be excited at a thermocline or a halocline, which are known as &quot;internal waves&quot;. Similar waves can be generated between a layer of water and a layer of oil. When the interface between these two surfaces is not horizontal and the system is close to hydrostatic equilibrium, the gradient of the pressure is vertical but the gradient of the density is not. Therefore the baroclinic vector is nonzero, and the sense of the baroclinic vector is to create vorticity to make the interface level out. In the process, the interface overshoots, and the result is an oscillation which is an internal gravity wave. Unlike surface gravity waves, internal gravity waves do not require a sharp interface. For example, in bodies of water, a gradual gradient in temperature or salinity is sufficient to support internal gravity waves driven by the baroclinic vector.

<doc id="166377" wikidata="Q379788" url="?curid=166377" title="Advection">
<text>In the field of physics, engineering, and earth sciences, advection is the transport of a substance or quantity by bulk motion of a fluid. The properties of that substance are carried with it. Generally the majority of the advected substance is also a fluid. The properties that are carried with the advected substance are conserved properties such as energy. An example of advection is the transport of pollutants or silt in a river by bulk water flow downstream. Another commonly advected quantity is energy or enthalpy. Here the fluid may be any material that contains thermal energy, such as water or air. In general, any substance or conserved, extensive quantity can be advected by a fluid that can hold or contain the quantity or substance.

During advection, a fluid transports some conserved quantity or material via bulk motion. The fluid&#x27;s motion is described mathematically as a vector field, and the transported material is described by a scalar field showing its distribution over space. Advection requires currents in the fluid, and so cannot happen in rigid solids. It does not include transport of substances by molecular diffusion.

Advection is sometimes confused with the more encompassing process of convection, which is the combination of advective transport and diffusive transport.

In meteorology and physical oceanography, advection often refers to the transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean, such as heat, humidity (see moisture) or salinity. 

Advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds and the precipitation of water from clouds, as part of the hydrological cycle.

==Mathematical description==
The advection equation is a first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation that governs the motion of a conserved scalar field as it is advected by a known velocity vector field. It is derived using the scalar field&#x27;s conservation law, together with Gauss&#x27;s theorem, and taking the infinitesimal limit.

One easily visualized example of advection is the transport of ink dumped into a river. As the river flows, ink will move downstream in a &quot;pulse&quot; via advection, as the water&#x27;s movement itself transports the ink. If added to a lake without significant bulk water flow, the ink would simply disperse outwards from its source in a diffusive manner, which is not advection. Note that as it moves downstream, the &quot;pulse&quot; of ink will also spread via diffusion. The sum of these processes is called convection.

===The advection equation===

The advection equation for a conserved quantity described by a scalar field formula_1 is expressed by a continuity equation:
formula_2
where vector field formula_3 is the flow velocity and formula_4 is the del operator. If the flow is assumed to be incompressible then formula_5 is solenoidal, that is, the divergence is zero:formula_6and (by using a product rule associated with the divergence) the above equation reduces to

formula_7

In particular, if the flow is steady, thenformula_8which shows that formula_9 is constant (because formula_10 for any vector formula_11) along a streamline. 

If a vector quantity formula_12 (such as a magnetic field) is being advected by the solenoidal velocity field formula_5, then the advection equation above becomes:

formula_14

Here, formula_12 is a vector field instead of the scalar field formula_9.

===Solution===

Solutions to the advection equation can be approximated using numerical methods, where interest typically centers on discontinuous &quot;shock&quot; solutions and necessary conditions for convergence (e.g. the CFL condition). 

Numerical simulation can be aided by considering the skew-symmetric form of advection
formula_17
where
formula_18

Since skew symmetry implies only imaginary eigenvalues, this form reduces the &quot;blow up&quot; and &quot;spectral blocking&quot; often experienced in numerical solutions with sharp discontinuities.

==Distinction between advection and convection==

The term &quot;advection&quot; often serves as a synonym for &quot;convection&quot;, and this correspondence of terms is used in the literature. More technically, convection applies to the movement of a fluid (often due to density gradients created by thermal gradients), whereas advection is the movement of some material by the velocity of the fluid. Thus, although it might seem confusing, it is technically correct to think of momentum being advected by the velocity field in the Navier-Stokes equations, although the resulting motion would be considered to be convection. Because of the specific use of the term convection to indicate transport in association with thermal gradients, it is probably safer to use the term advection if one is uncertain about which terminology best describes their particular system.

==Meteorology==
In meteorology and physical oceanography, advection often refers to the horizontal transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean, such as heat, humidity or salinity, and convection generally refers to vertical transport (vertical advection). Advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds (terrain-forced convection) and the precipitation of water from clouds, as part of the hydrological cycle.

== Other quantities ==
The advection equation also applies if the quantity being advected is represented by a probability density function at each point, although accounting for diffusion is more difficult.

<doc id="166378" wikidata="Q190986" url="?curid=166378" title="Merkava">
<text>The Merkava (, , &quot;chariot&quot;) is a series of main battle tanks used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the backbone of the IDF&#x27;s Armored Corps. Current iterations of this tank are considered broadly equivalent to the capabilities of the M1 Abrams, Leopard 2 and the Challenger 2. The current iteration of this vehicle also shares the same MTU EuroPowerPack powerplant as a number of other tank platforms.

Development began in 1970, and its first generation, the Merkava Mark 1, entered official service in 1979. Four main variants have been deployed. As of 2023, Merkava Mark 4 Barak is the latest version. The Merkava was first used extensively in the 1982 Lebanon War. The name &quot;Merkava&quot; was derived from the IDF&#x27;s initial development program name.

The tank was developed in the Merkava and Armored Combat Vehicles Division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, and most of its parts are manufactured in Israel. The Merkava was designed to provide maximum protection for its crew, and therefore its front armor was fortified and the engine placed in the front part of the tank, unlike most other tanks.

Design criteria include rapid repair of battle damage, survivability, cost-effectiveness, and off-road performance. Following the model of contemporary self-propelled howitzers, the turret assembly is located closer to the rear than in most main battle tanks. With the engine in front, this layout is intended to provide additional protection against a frontal attack, so as to absorb some of the force of incoming shells and projectiles, especially for the personnel in the main hull, such as the driver. It also creates more space in the rear of the tank that allows increased storage capacity and a rear entrance to the main crew compartment allowing easy access under enemy fire. This allows the tank to be used as a platform for medical disembarkation (with no ammunition, the Merkava can hold up to 4 stretchers, but this is only an emergency measure), a forward command and control station, and an infantry fighting vehicle. The rear entrance&#x27;s clamshell-style doors provide overhead protection when off- and on-loading cargo and personnel.

==Development==
During the late 1960s, the Israeli Army collaborated on certain design aspects for the British Chieftain tank which had originally been introduced into British Army service in 1965, with a view to Israel purchasing and domestically producing the vehicle. Two Chieftain prototypes were delivered as part of a four-year trial. However, it was eventually decided not to sell the Chieftain to the Israelis, as the tanks were already being supplied to Arab countries, which prompted them to follow their own development programme.

Israel Tal, who was serving as a brigade commander after the Suez Crisis, restarted plans to produce an indigenous Israeli tank, utilizing information learned from the 1973 Yom Kippur War – when Israel had suffered heavy losses of mechanized armour.

By 1974, initial designs were completed and prototypes were built. After a brief set of trials, work began to retool the Tel HaShomer ordnance depot for full-time development and construction. After the new facilities were completed, the Merkava was announced to the public in the &quot;International Defense Review&quot; periodical. The first official images of the tank were released to the American periodical &quot;Armed Forces Journal&quot; on May 4, 1977. The IDF officially adopted the tank in December 1979.

==Primary contractors==
The lead organization for system integration of the Merkava&#x27;s main components is Israel Military Industries (IMI). The Israeli Ordnance Corps are responsible for final Merkava assembly. More than 90% of the Merkava 4 tank&#x27;s components are produced locally in Israel by Israeli defense industries. Contributors to the vehicle include:
* IMI manufactures the 105 mm and 120 mm main guns and their ammunition;
* TGL SP Industries LTD develop and production of the road wheels.
* Urdan Industries assembles and constructs the hull, drive- and powertrains, and turret assemblies;
* Soltam manufactures the 60 mm internal mortar;
* Elta designs and manufactures the electronic sensors and infrared optics;
* Elbit delivers the ballistics computer, fire-control system (FCS) and electric turret and gun control system;
* Tadiran provides cabin air conditioning, crew cabin intercom and radio equipment;
* El-Op, Elisra and Astronautics implement the optics and laser warning systems;
* Rafael Advanced Defense Systems builds and installs the Rafael Overhead Weapon Station (R-OWS) and Trophy active protection system;
* L-3 Communication Combat Propulsion Systems produces licensed copies of Germany&#x27;s MTU MT883 1500 hp diesel engine powerplant and RENK RK325 transmissions;
* Motorola supplies Tadiran communication encryption systems;
* DuPont supplies the Nomex, ballistic, and fire-retardant materials used by Hagor;
* Russia Military Industries helped to design the KMT-4 &amp; -5 anti-mine rollers and the ABK-3 dozer blade, now built by Urdan;
* FN Herstal supplies 7.62 mm (MAG 58) and 12.7 mm (M2) coaxial and pintle-mounted machine guns;
* Caterpillar assisted with an Israeli-designed track system.
* Bental Industries, a TAT Technologies subsidiary, produced the brushless motors used in the Mark 4 turret and gun control system.

==General characteristics==
===Firepower===
The Merkava Mark 1 and 2 were armed with a 105 mm IMI M64 gun, a license-built variant of the M68. The Mark 3, Mark 3 &quot;Dor Dalet BAZ kassag&quot;, and the Mark 4 are armed with an IMI 120 mm smoothbore gun which can fire almost all versions of Western 120 mm smooth bore tank ammunition, as well as the LAHAT anti-tank guided missile.

Each model of the Merkava has two roof-mounted 7.62 mm machine guns for use by the commander and loader and another mounted co-axially with the main gun. A 60 mm mortar is also fitted for firing smoke rounds or suppressing dug-in infantry anti-tank teams.

All Merkava tanks are fitted with a remote-controlled M2 Browning .50 caliber heavy machine gun, aligned with the main gun and controlled from within the turret.

===Mobility===
The tank&#x27;s 1,119 kW turbocharged diesel engine was designed by MTU and is manufactured under license by L-3 Communication Combat Propulsion Systems (formerly General Dynamics).

==Variants==
===Merkava Mark I===

The Mark 1, operational since 1979, is the original design created as a result of Israel Tal&#x27;s decision, and was fabricated and designed for mass production. The Mark 1 weighed 63 tonnes and had a diesel engine, with a power-to-weight ratio of 14 hp/Tonne. It was armed with the 105 millimeter M64 L71A main gun (a licensed copy of the American M68), two 7.62 mm machine guns for anti-infantry defense, and a 60 mm mortar mounted externally, with the mortar operator not completely protected by the tank&#x27;s hull.

The general design borrows the tracks and road wheels from the British Centurion tank, which had seen extensive use during the Yom Kippur war.

The Merkava was first used in combat during the 1982 Lebanon War, where Israel deployed 180 units. Although they were a success, the M113 APCs that accompanied them were found to have several defects and were withdrawn. Merkavas were converted into makeshift APCs or armored ambulances by taking out the palleted ammunition racks in storage. Ten soldiers or walking wounded could enter and exit through the rear door.

After the war, many adjustments and additions were noted and designed, including the need for the 60 mm mortar to be installed within the hull and engineered for remote firing—a valuable feature that the Israelis had initially encountered on their Centurion Mk3s with their 2&quot; Mk.III mortar. A shot trap was found beneath the rear of the turret , where a well-placed shot could jam the turret completely. The installation of chain netting to disperse and destroy rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank rockets before impacting the primary armor increased survivability.
===Merkava Mark II===
The Mark II was first introduced into general service in April 1983. It incorporated numerous small adjustments as a result of the previous year&#x27;s incursion into Lebanon.

The Mark II used the same 105 mm main gun and 7.62 mm machine guns as the Mark I, but the 60 mm mortar was redesigned during construction to be located within the hull and configured for remote firing to remove the need to expose the operator to enemy small-arms fire. An Israeli-designed automatic transmission and increased fuel storage for increased range was installed on all further Mark IIs. Anti-rocket netting was fitted for increased survivability against infantry equipped with anti-tank rockets. Many minor improvements were made to the fire-control system. Updated meteorological sensors, crosswind analyzers, and thermographic optics and image intensifiers gave greater visibility and battlefield awareness.

Newer versions of the original Mark II were designated:
* Mark IIB, with thermal optics and unspecified updates to the fire control system.
* Mark IIC, with more armor on the top of the turret to improve protection against attack from the air.
* Mark IID, with modular composite armor on the chassis and turret, allowing rapid replacement of damaged armor.

In 2015 the IDF had begun a plan to take the old models out of storage and repurpose them as heavy armored personnel carriers. Cannons, turrets, and spaces used to store tank shells inside the hull were removed to create a personnel carrier that outperforms the lighter M113 APC. Converting hundreds of Mark II chassis provides a low-cost way to upgrade support units&#x27; abilities to perform medical, logistical, and rescue missions.

By late 2016, the last conscripted brigade to operate Merkava 2 was scheduled to transition to Merkava III and Merkava IV tanks for battlefield missions, relegating the vehicles to reserve forces for border patrols during conflicts and conversion to personnel carriers.

===Merkava Mark 3===

The Merkava Mark 3 was introduced in December 1989 and was in production until 2003. As of 2016, the Merkava III was the most numerous tank in frontline IDF service. Compared to the Merkava II, it has upgrades to the drivetrain, powertrain, armament, and electronic systems. The most prominent addition was the incorporation of the locally developed IMI 120 mm gun. This gun and a larger diesel engine raised the total weight of the tank to , but the larger engine raised the maximum cruising speed to .

The turret was re-engineered for movement independent of the tank chassis, allowing it to track a target regardless of the tank&#x27;s movement. Many other changes were made, including:
* External two-way telephone for secure communications between the tank crew and dismounted infantry,
* Upgraded ammunition storage containers to minimize ammunition cook-off
* Addition of laser designators
* Incorporation of the &quot;Kasag&quot; modular armor system, designed for rapid replacement and repair in the battlefield and for quick upgrading as new designs and sophisticated materials become available

====BAZ System====
The 1995 Mark 3 BAZ (Hebrew acronym for &quot;ברק זוהר&quot;, &quot;Barak Zoher&quot;, signifying &quot;Shining Lightning&quot;) had several updates and added systems including:
* NBC protection systems
* Locally developed central air-conditioning system
* Added improvements in ballistic protection
* The Mark 3D has removable modular composite armor on the chassis and turret

====Dor-Dalet====
The last generation of the Mark 3 class was the Mark 3D &quot;Dor-Dalet&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;Fourth Generation&quot;), which included several components as prototypes to be introduced in the Mark 4.
* Upgraded and strengthened tracks (built by Caterpillar, designed in Israel),
* Installation of the Rafael Overhead Weapon Station.
* Independent, fully stabilised, panoramic commander&#x27;s sights allowing &quot;hunter-killer&quot; ability.
* Advanced thermal imagers for both gunner and commander.

===Merkava Mark 4===
The Merkava Mark 4 began development in 1999, and production in 2004. The upgrade&#x27;s development was announced in an October 1999 edition of the military publication &quot;Bamachaneh&quot; (&quot;At the Camp&quot;). However, the Merkava Mark 3 remained in production until 2003. The first Merkava IVs were in production in limited numbers by the end of 2004.

Removable modular armor, from the Merkava Mark 3D, is used on all sides, including the top and a V-shaped belly armor pack for the underside. This modular system is designed to allow damaged tanks to be rapidly repaired and returned to the field. Because rear armor is thinner, chains with iron balls are attached to detonate projectiles before they hit the main armored hull. It is the first contemporary tank without a loader&#x27;s hatch in the turret roof, because any aperture in the turret roof increases risk of penetration by ATGMs. Tank rounds are stored in individual fire-proof canisters, which reduce the chance of cook-offs in a fire inside the tank. The turret is electrically, rather than hydraulically, powered (hydraulic turrets use flammable liquid that ignites if the turret is penetrated) and &quot;dry&quot;: no active rounds are stored in it.

Some features, such as hull shaping, exterior non-reflective paints (radar cross-section reduction), and shielding for engine heat plumes mixing with outside air (reduced infrared signature) to confuse enemy thermal imagers, were carried over from the IAI Lavi program of the Israeli Air Force to make the tank harder to spot and target by heat sensors and radar.

The Mark 4 includes the larger 120 mm main gun of the previous versions, but can fire a wider variety of ammunition, including high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), and sabot rounds like the armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) kinetic energy penetrator, using an electrical semi-automatic revolving magazine for 10 rounds. It also includes a much larger 12.7 mm machine gun for anti-vehicle operations (most commonly used against technicals).

The Mark IV has the Israeli-designed &quot;TSAWS&quot; (tracks, springs, and wheels system) caterpillar track system, called &quot;Mazkom&quot; () by troops. This system is designed to reduce track-shedding under the harsh basalt rock conditions of Lebanon and the Golan Heights.

The model has a new fire-control system, the El-Op &quot;Knight Mark 4&quot;. An Amcoram LWS-2 laser warning receiver notifies the crew of threats like laser-guided anti-tank missiles and the fire-control system can launch smoke grenades to obscure the tank from the laser beam. Electromagnetic warning against radar illumination is also installed.

The tank carries the Israeli Elbit Systems BMS (Battle Management System; Hebrew: צי&quot;ד), a centralised system that takes data from tracked units and UAVs in theater, displays it on color screens, and distributes it in encrypted form to all other units in a given theater equipped with BMS.

The Merkava IV has been designed for fast repair and replacement of damaged armour, with modular armour that can be easily removed and replaced. It is designed to be cost-effective in production and maintenance.

The tank has a high-performance air conditioning system, and can be fitted with a toilet for long-duration missions.

====Mark 4 Meil Ru&#x27;ach (Mk 4M) Windbreaker====
The Merkava Mark 4M (Mk 4M) Windbreaker is a Merkava Mark 4 equipped with the Trophy active protection system (APS), designated &quot;Meil Ruach&quot; (; &quot;Windbreaker&quot; or &quot;Wind Coat&quot;). Mass production of Mark 4M tanks began in 2009, and the first whole brigade of Mark 4Ms was declared operational in 2011. The Trophy APS successfully intercepted rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles, including 9M133 Kornets, fired by Hamas before and during Operation Protective Edge in 2014.

====Mark 4 Meil Ru&#x27;ach 400 (Mk. 4M 400) Windbreaker====
A midlife upgrade for the Mk. 4M that is somewhat of a bridge between the Mk. 4M and the Mk. 4 Barak.

=== Merkava 4 Barak ===

The Merkava Mark 4 Barak (Lightning) entered service in 2023. The tank has an upgraded Trophy APS, 360-degree day/night camera coverage for boosted situational awareness, a fighter jet–style helmet-mounted display for the tank commander, and new sensors enabling it to independently acquire targets and strike them rapidly, as well as having electronic warfare abilities and advanced processing systems, and a direct energy system capable of intercepting drones and cruise missiles. The Merkava Mark IV tank also has enhanced armor on top of the turret, providing more protection to the crew against drone strikes.

==== Iron Vision helmet-mounted display system ====
A main feature of the Barak, unveiled in July 2018, is the integration of the Iron Vision helmet-mounted augmented reality system, using high-resolution cameras arrayed around the tank to provide a 360° virtual reality view of a tank&#x27;s surroundings to crew members&#x27; helmet displays while protected inside. Israeli company Elbit developed the system for the F-35 fighter aircraft.

===Specifications of models===
==Combat history==
The Merkava has participated in the following actions.

=== 1982 Lebanon War ===

The Merkava was used widely during the 1982 Lebanon War. The tank outperformed contemporary Syrian tanks (mostly T-62s), and its front proved largely immune to the anti-tank weapons of the time (the AT-3 Sagger and RPG-7) that were used against it. It was judged to be a significant improvement over Israel&#x27;s formerly most effective main battle tank, the Centurion. Israel lost dozens of tanks during the conflict, including several Merkavas.

=== Second Intifada ===
In February 2002, a Merkava III was destroyed by a roadside bomb near Netzarim in the Gaza Strip. The tank was lured into intervening in an attack on a settler convoy. The tank went over a heavy mine (estimated 100 kg TNT), which detonated and totally destroyed the tank. Four soldiers were killed in the blast. This was the first main battle tank to be destroyed during the Second Intifada. A second Merkava II or Merkava III, was destroyed a month later in the same area and a further three soldiers were killed. A third Merkava II or III tank was destroyed near the Kissufim Crossing, when one soldier was killed and two wounded.

=== 2006 Lebanon War ===
During the 2006 Lebanon War, five Merkava tanks were destroyed. Most of the tanks engaged were Merkava IIIs and earlier versions; only a few of the tanks used during the war were Merkava Mark 4, since by 2006 they had entered service in limited numbers. Hezbollah fired over 1,000 anti-tank missiles during the conflict against both tanks and dismounted infantry. Some 45 percent of all tanks and armoured vehicles hit with anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) during the conflict suffered some form of armour penetration.

In total, 15 tank crewmen were killed by these ATGM penetrations. The penetrations were caused by tandem warhead missiles. Hezbollah weaponry was believed to include Russian RPG-29 &#x27;Vampir&#x27;, AT-5 &#x27;Konkurs&#x27;, AT-13 &#x27;Metis-M&#x27;, and laser-guided AT-14 &#x27;Kornet&#x27; HEAT missiles. The RPG-29 was able to defeat the advanced reactive armor on the Merkava 4. The IDF reported finding Kornet ATGMs on Hezbollah positions in the village of Ghandouriyeh. Several months after the cease-fire, reports have provided detailed photographic evidence that Kornet ATGMs were indeed both possessed and used by Hezbollah in this area.

Another Merkava IV tank crewman was killed when a tank ran over an improvised explosive device (IED). This tank had additional V-shaped underside armor, limiting casualties to just one of the seven personnel (four crewmen and three infantrymen) on board. In total, five Merkava tanks (two Merkava IIs, one Merkava III, and two Merkava IVs) were destroyed. Of these two Merkava Mark 4, one was damaged by an IED, and the other being destroyed by a Russian AT-14 &#x27;Kornet&#x27; missile. The Israeli military said that it was satisfied with the Merkava Mark IV&#x27;s performance, and attributed problems to insufficient training before the war. In total, 50 Merkava tanks (predominantly Merkava IIs and IIIs) were hit, eight of which remained serviceable on the battlefield. 21 tanks suffered armour penetrations (15 from missiles, and 6 from IEDs and anti-tank mines).

After the 2006 war, and as the IDF becomes increasingly involved in unconventional and guerrilla warfare, some analysts say the Merkava is too vulnerable to advanced anti-tank missiles, that in their man-portable types can be fielded by guerrilla warfare opponents. Other post-war analysts, including David Eshel, disagree, arguing that reports of losses to Merkavas were overstated and that &quot;summing up the performance of Merkava tanks, especially the latest version Merkava Mark 4, most tank crews agree that, in spite of the losses sustained and some major flaws in tactical conduct, the tank proved its mettle in its first high-saturation combat.&quot;

On a comparison done by the armor corps newsletter, it was shown that the average number of crewmen killed per tank penetrated by missile/rocket was reduced from 2 during the Yom Kippur War to 1.5 during the 1982 Lebanon War to 1 during the 2006 Lebanon War proving how, even in the face of the improvement in anti-tank weaponry, the Merkava series tanks provide increasingly better protection to its crew. The IDF wanted to increase orders of new Merkava Mark 4 tanks, and planned to add the Trophy active defense system to Merkava Mark 4 tanks, and to increase joint training between crews and Israeli anti-tank soldiers.

=== Operation Cast Lead ===

The Merkava Mark IV was used more extensively during the Gaza War, as it had been received by the IDF in increasing numbers since 2006, replacing more of the Merkava II and III versions of the tank that were in service. One brigade of Merkava IVs managed to bisect the Gaza strip in five hours without Israeli casualties. The commander of the brigade stated that battlefield tactics had been greatly revised since 2006. Tactics had also been modified to focus on asymmetric or guerrilla war threats, in addition to the conventional war scenarios that the Merkava had mainly been designed to combat.

The IDF also deployed the Merkava II and III during the war.

=== Gaza border areas ===

By October 2010, the IDF had begun to equip the first Merkava Mark IVs with the Trophy active protection system, to improve the tanks&#x27; protection against advanced anti-tank missiles which use tandem-charge HEAT warheads. Added protection systems included an Elbit laser-warning system and IMI in-built smoke-screen grenades.

In December 2010, Hamas fired an AT-14 Kornet anti-tank missile at a Merkava Mark 3 tank stationed on the Israel-Gaza border near Al-Bureij. Before then, it was not suspected that Hamas possessed such an advanced missile. The missile penetrated the tank&#x27;s armour, but caused no injuries among its crew. As a result of the attack, Israel decided to deploy its first Merkava Mark 4 battalion equipped with the Trophy system along the Gaza border.

On March 1, 2011, a Merkava Mark IV stationed near the Gaza border, equipped with the Trophy active protection system, successfully foiled a missile attack against it, marking the system&#x27;s first operational success.

=== Operation Protective Edge 2014 ===

No tanks were damaged during Operation Protective Edge. The Merkava Mk 4M tanks, fitted with the Trophy Active Protection system, intercepted anti-tank missiles and RPGs on dozens of occasions during the ground operation. During the operation, the system intercepted anti-tank weapons, mostly Kornet, and some Metis-M and RPG-29, proving itself effective against man-portable anti-tank weapons. By identifying the source of fire, Trophy also allowed tanks to kill a Hamas anti-tank team on one occasion.

Giora Katz, head of Rafael&#x27;s land division, stated that it was a &quot;breakthrough because it is the first time in military history where an active defense system has proven itself in intense fighting.&quot;

The 401st Brigade, equipped with Merkava Mk 4M tanks, alone killed between 120 and 130 Hamas fighters during the ground fighting phase of Operation Protective Edge, according to the IDF.

=== 2023 Israel-Hamas War ===
According to &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, Hamas may have briefly captured 10 Merkava tanks in the October 7 attacks, but it is unclear how many tanks they damaged or destroyed. At least 1 tank was destroyed when Hamas used a civilian DJI and Autel quadcopter drone to drop a shaped-charge grenade. 

According to Forbes, Hamas used flyers to disseminate advice for defeating the Merkava&#x27;s Trophy active protection system. This advice included such things as: firing rocket-propelled grenades from 50 yards or closer; firing several RPG rounds in quick succession; using an SPG-9, and other information.

On 16 October 2023, Merkavas were seen equipped with added slat armour placed above the turrets. Slat armour has proven effective in defense against a number of munitions dropped by small drones. Hamas has released video footage that suggested unsuccessful strikes against Merkavas using drones.

In December 2023, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that Hamas had &quot;knocked out&quot; about 20 tanks.

On 24 May 2024, The Al-Qassam Brigades reported having destroyed an Merkava MK 2 using a “Shawaz” explosive device in the Al-Qasasib neighborhood of Jabalia Camp.

In October 2024, Ynet reported that the IDF planned to outsource repair of its armored vehicles including tanks for the first time due to damage sustained during the Israel-Hamas War. The following month, the IDF reported shortages of tanks and tank shells.

=== 2024 Israel–Hezbollah war ===
IDF said soldiers from the 36th armored division had also entered operations in Lebanon joining forces from the 98th division already operating in the border area.

Hezbollah used AT-14 Kornet missiles during engagements with Israeli forces. The missiles were used from the Tharallah Twin ATGM system, which is a quadripod equipped with two Kornets fired in rapid succession. This arrangement is designed to overwhelm the Trophy APS of Merkava tanks by having a second missile available before the APS can react after the first intercept (reloading requires at least 1.5 seconds). Hezbollah reportedly acquired the Tharallah ATGM system in 2015. In July 2024, Hezbollah published a video recorded by a camera installed on ATGM targeting Merkava tank, which activated the Trophy system. The video was followed by footage from another camera showing smoke from the tank location. Israel did not comment on video, similarly to how it ignored previous videos. Recent videos in July 2024 also show the Qassam Brigades successfully destroying and igniting a Namer and a Merkava, which were both equipped with a trophy APS and in both cases it had failed to intercept the shell.

On 2 October 2024, Hezbollah said it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with rockets.

==Derivatives==
Following the Second Intifada the Israel Defense Forces modified some of their Merkavas to satisfy the needs of urban warfare.

===Merkava LIC===

These are Merkava Mark 3 BAZ or Mark 4 tanks, converted for urban warfare. The LIC designation stands for &quot;low intensity conflict&quot;, underlining its emphasis on counter-insurgency, street-to-street inner-city asymmetrical type warfare of the 21st century.

The Merkava is equipped with a turret 12.7 mm caliber coaxial machine gun, which enables the crew to lay down fairly heavy cover fire without using the main gun (which is relatively ineffective against individual enemy combatants). Like the new remote-operated weapon station, the coaxial machine-gun is fired from inside the tank without exposing the crew to small-arms fire and snipers.

The most sensitive areas of a tank, its optics, exhaust ports and ventilators, are all protected by a newly developed high-strength metal mesh to prevent explosive charges being planted there.

Rubber whip pole-markers with LED tips and a driver&#x27;s rear-facing camera have been installed to improve navigation and maneuverability in an urban environment by day or by night.

===Merkava &quot;Tankbulance&quot;===

Some Merkava tanks are fitted with full medical and ambulance abilities while retaining their armament (but carrying less ammunition than the standard tank, having both ammunition racks in the rear removed). The cabin area is converted for carrying injured personnel and includes two stretchers and life support medical station systems supplemented by a full medical team complement to operate under combat conditions with a Merkava battalion. The vehicle retains its rear door to facilitate evacuation under fire, and can provide cover-fire/fire-support to infantry.

The &quot;tankbulance&quot; is not an unarmed ambulance and consequently is not protected by the Geneva Convention&#x27;s provisions regarding ambulances, but it is far less vulnerable to accidental or deliberate fire than an ambulance or armored personnel carrier.

===Merkava IFV &quot;Namer&quot;===

Namer (Hebrew: leopard, which is also an abbreviation of Nagmash (APC) Merkava&quot;), is an infantry fighting vehicle based on the Merkava Mark 4 chassis. In service since 2008, the vehicle was initially called &quot;Nemmera&quot; (Hebrew: leopardess), but later renamed to &quot;Namer&quot;.

Namer is equipped with a Samson Remote Controlled Weapon Station (RCWS) armed with either a .50 M2 Browning Heavy Machinegun or a Mk 19 Automatic Grenade Launcher. It also has a 7.62 mm MAG machine gun, 60 mm mortar and smoke grenades. Like the Merkava Mark 4, it is optimized for high level of crew survival on the battlefield. The &quot;Namer&quot; has a three-man crew (commander, driver, and RCWS gunner) and may carry up to nine infantrymen and a stretcher. An ambulance variant can carry two casualties on stretchers and medical equipment.

The Golani Brigade used two &quot;Namer&quot; IFVs during Operation Cast Lead. During Operation Protective Edge more than 20 vehicles were operated with great success and post operation analysis recommended procuring more of them.

===Merkava ARV &quot;Nemmera&quot;===

The Merkava armored recovery vehicle initially called &quot;Namer&quot; (Hebrew: leopard), but subsequently renamed &quot;Nemmera&quot; (Hebrew: leopardess) is an armored recovery vehicle based on a Merkava Mark 3 or 4 chassis. It can tow disabled tanks and carries a complete Merkava back-up power pack that can be changed in the field in under 90 minutes.

===Merkava Howitzer &quot;Sholef&quot;===
Two prototypes of &quot;Sholef&quot; (&quot;Slammer&quot;, Hebrew slang for &quot;Gunslinger&quot;) 155 mm self-propelled howitzer with an automatic loading system were built by Soltam in 1984–86. The 45-tonne vehicle had a long 155 mm gun barrel giving a range of 45+ km. Using GPS, inertial navigation, and an internal fire control computer, it was also capable of direct fire while on the move. It never entered production.

The Slammer is a heavily armored artillery gun mounted on a modified Merkava Mk 1 chassis. Many of these vehicles are Merkava Mk 1 that were retired after the Merkava Mk 2 and Merkava Mk 3 came into service. The Slammer has a long 52-caliber gun barrel that allows +10% range. Reload speed may be decreased to 1 for one minute every 10 minutes through use of an automatic loader. Ammunition racks are large. The Slammer is ready for autonomous operation (without an FDC) if the target&#x27;s location is known within 15 seconds of a halt, using GPS, inertial navigation, and an internal fire control computer.

The Slammer 155 mm self-propelled howitzer is based on a modified Merkava MBT chassis fitted with a new welded steel turret, designed by Soltam Systems.

Development commenced in the 1970s. The project was considered of high national priority and incorporated the newest technological developments. Instead the Israeli Defense Forces selected an upgraded version of American M109 howitzer.

The Sholef&#x27;s chassis, aside from a few minor modifications, is identical to that of the Merkava Mk 3. The glacis plate is unchanged, except for the addition of a support bracket for the gun turret, which is folded down when not in use. As such, the Sholef and Merkava series share a large percentage of common components. The front-left side of the chassis has a prominent exhaust louver, along with a much smaller port just in front of it; the exact function of this port is uncertain, though the soot seen around it in photos of the Sholef suggests it may be a new or additional exhaust port, or perhaps an outlet for a smoke generator.

The Sholef can be ready to fire only 15 seconds after coming to a complete stop, and fire three projectiles in only 15 seconds. It is compatible with standard NATO 155 mm ammunition, and a total of 75 projectiles can be stowed in one Sholef, 60 of which are ready for combat.

The Sholef&#x27;s 155 mm/52 gun is an original design created by Soltam, though it bears a resemblance to South Africa&#x27;s G5 howitzer. It has a fume extractor and muzzle brake, and is kept stationary by a travel lock while the vehicle is on the move. This gun has a maximum rate of fire of 9 rounds/min, and a range in excess of 40,000 m when firing an ERFB-BB round. Though loaded automatically, the gun may be cycled and fire manually if the need arises. While the gun is normally carried by a travel lock as with most other self-propelled howitzers while the Sholef is on the move, the weapon is stabilized and can actually be used for direct-fire while the vehicle is moving, giving it much greater self-defense ability than most other vehicles of its type.

A crew of four is required to fully operate the Sholef. Air conditioning and heating for the crew are provided, as is a ration heater.

The hull has the same ballistic protection as the Merkava Mk.III. The armor on the turret is sufficient to defeat small arms fire, shell splinters, blast overpressure, and most heavy machine gun rounds. The armor is augmented by spall liners, and the same overpressure NBC system as the Merkava Mk.III is fitted. There is also a back-up collective NBC system.

The running gear consists of six unevenly spaced rubber-tired roadwheels on each side, and five return rollers, the second from the rear of which is noticeably larger than the others. The drive sprocket is forward, and the conspicuously spoked idler is rear. These may be partially obscured by track skirts, of which the Merkava Mk.III has ten panels, with a wavering underside, and little coverage of the sprocket or idler.

The ordnance is fitted with a fume extractor and a double-baffle muzzle brake. When travelling, the ordnance is held in position by a travel lock that is mounted on the forward part of the glacis plate and this is remotely operated from the crew compartment.

Firing an ERFB-BB projectile, the 155 mm 52 calibre ordnance has a maximum range of 40,000+ m.

The 155 mm 52 calibre ordnance and recoil system is of the companies well-proven type already used in its towed weapons. The breech block assembly is of the semi-automatic wedge type that contains an automatic primer feeding system that enables manual reloading of the primer without opening the breech. Turret traverse and weapon elevation is hydraulic, with manual controls for emergency use.

A maximum rate of fire of 9 rounds/min can be achieved due to the automatic computerised loading system, and a burst rate of fire of three rounds in 15 seconds.

The high rate of fire can be achieved using the onboard ammunition supply or from ground-piled ammunition. The loading cycle is operated by two turret crewmen only, with the commander operating the computer and charge loader.

The automatic loader has five main subsystems: projectile storage system; projectile transfer system; loading tray with flick rammer; charge loading tray and elevator for external charge supply; and projectile elevator for reloading the external storage or directly loading the gun.

The internal projectile storage contains 60 projectiles ready for automatic loading with the remaining 15 stored in other locations. The system enables the handling of all kinds of projectiles in use without any adaptation.

Charge loading is accomplished manually using a loading tray with the ignition primer being inserted automatically. All systems have a manual back-up so that, in the case of failure, the loading system may be operated partly or completely manually by only three crewmen, so allowing a continuous firing rate of 4 rounds/min.

The computer also controls the functioning of the gun. The Loader Control System (LCS) consists of five main units:
# The commander&#x27;s panel provides the means for the commander to control the automatic loader and has a dedicated keyboard and supporting electronic circuits
# The Central Control Unit (CCU) is based on the Intel 80286 and produces all of the system&#x27;s logic equations. The unit transfers commands through the serial communications (RS-422) to the computerised units and controls the display on the commander&#x27;s panel
# The Terminal Units (TUs) are based on the 8031 controller for purposes of independent control of the drive elements according to a functionally determined division. With the assistance of the terminal unit, a local mode can also be used in working with selected elements
# For guiding operators and making round identification and fusing, the Operator&#x27;s Panel (OP) includes a liquid-crystal display with fixed instructions and one dot matrix line.
# The Loader Keyboard Panel (LKP) includes breech block closing switch, fire and local activation of the trays.

The main operational roles are: firing from internal storage; firing for elevator – ground-piled ammunition; loading from elevator – external pile; synthesising fire programs; unloading; manual firing; identification; and fusing and checks.

Standard equipment includes an NBC system of the overpressure type and an inertial navigation and aiming system designed for autonomous operations.

According to Soltam Systems, the 155 mm/52 caliber ordnance and automatic loader, or parts of the system, could be installed in other self-propelled artillery systems and used to upgrade other self-propelled systems such as the US-designed and built 155 mm M109 and M44.

== Successor (Carmel) ==
On July 14, 2011, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that the IDF had begun developing a successor for the Merkava series of tanks. The development was begun in part by the arrival of the Trophy active protection system. With the system&#x27;s ability to intercept threats at a stand-off distance, there was a review of the need for vehicles like the Merkava to have thick, heavy layers of armor.

The Merkava Tank Planning Directorate set up a team to study principles for a future tank and present ideas for an armored fighting vehicle to provide mobile firepower on a future battlefield. The team reviewed basic design principles including lessening its weight, armor thickness compared to an APS to intercept anti-tank threats, reducing the crew size, and the type of main gun. Horsepower abilities and heavy and light track systems compared to a wheeled chassis were also considered. With future battlefield condition developments affecting design features, the vehicle may not be considered a &quot;tank&quot; in the traditional sense.

By July 2012, details began to emerge of considerations for developing technologies for the new design. One possibility is the replacement of the traditional main gun with a laser cannon or an electromagnetic cannon. Other improvements could include a hybrid-electric engine and a reduced crew of two. The goals of the new tank are to make it faster, better protected, more interoperable and lethal than the prior Merkava.

The 65-tonne Merkava is not regarded as useful for missions other than conventional warfare. The Israeli Army Armored Corps wants a lighter and highly mobile vehicle for rapid-response and urban warfare situations that can fill multiple roles. In 2012, the Defense Ministry drafted a program for development of a new family of light armored vehicles called &quot;Rakiya&quot; (Heavens), a Hebrew acronym for &quot;future manned combat vehicle&quot; (FMCV). The FMCV is planned to weigh 35 tonnes and have sufficient armor and weapons for both urban and conventional military operations. Instead of one multi-mission chassis, separate vehicles in distinct variants will perform different roles with all vehicles using common components. Vehicles are likely to be wheeled to maneuver in urban environments and move troops and equipment around in built-up areas.

While the FMCV will be a fifth-generation vehicle as a follow-on to the Merkava IV, it will not be a replacement for the tank. The Merkava and Namer heavy tracked vehicles will remain in service for decades, while FMCV vehicles are to address entirely different operational requirements.

Although the program seems similar to the American Future Combat Systems effort, which failed to produce a family of rapidly deployable lightweight ground vehicles, program officials say they learned from the American experience and that the FMCV was more focused and driven by simpler and more reasonable requirements based on cost considerations.

Officials expect requirements for a range of configurations for FMCV light armored vehicles to be approved in 2014 and solicited to Israeli and American companies. The IDF hoped the FMCV family of vehicles would be operational by 2020. The program was named Carmel around 2016, and three contractors, Elbit, Rafael and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), were to produce three prototypes by 2019.

On August 4, 2019, all three prototypes were tested. IAI&#x27;s model was based on the company&#x27;s existing unmanned, autonomous drone platforms, operated by a controller from the Xbox video game system; the tank had a large panoramic display, was able to assist the crew members in identifying targets and selecting weapons, and could drive itself in some terrains.

Elbit&#x27;s model used its Iron Vision helmets, which works with cameras and sensors on the outside of the tank to give the soldiers inside a 360-degree field of vision. It is a variation on a similar helmet that the company created for the F-35 fighter jet. A number of other autonomous and AI systems also assist the soldiers inside in identifying targets and general decision-making.

Rafael&#x27;s prototype used a transparent cockpit design that also gave the two soldiers inside a 360-degree field of view. Its augmented reality systems allowed the crew members to quickly see targets, friendly forces and important locations. The Rafael tank also had “an autonomous mission support system, for autonomous mission planning, driving, and simultaneous operation of all vehicle weapon systems, all based on combat artificial intelligence capabilities”.

In 2021, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) was selected to lead the next phase of Carmel&#x27;s development.

==Export==
In May 2012, Israel offered procurement of Merkava IV tanks to the Colombian Army. The sale would include 25–40 tanks at an approximate cost of $4.5 million each, and several Namer APCs. With the threat of the expanding Venezuelan military, it would strengthen Colombian armored forces against Venezuelan T-72 tanks.

In 2014, Israel reported that exports of the Mk 4 had begun; the purchasing country&#x27;s name was not disclosed for security reasons.

In July 2022, an armoured vehicle-launched bridge (AVLB) variant of the Merkava was delivered to the Philippine Army as part of a government-to-government deal with Israel.

<text>Natural history is a domain of inquiry involving organisms, including animals, fungi, and plants, in their natural environment, leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study. A person who studies natural history is called a naturalist or natural historian.

Natural history encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it. It involves the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms, so while it dates from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world, through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation, today&#x27;s natural history is a cross-discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences; e.g., geobiology has a strong multidisciplinary nature.

==Definitions==
===Before 1900===

The meaning of the English term &quot;natural history&quot; (a calque of the Latin &quot;historia naturalis&quot;) has narrowed progressively with time, while, by contrast, the meaning of the related term &quot;nature&quot; has widened (see also History below).

In antiquity, &quot;natural history&quot; covered essentially anything connected with nature, or used materials drawn from nature, such as Pliny the Elder&#x27;s encyclopedia of this title, published , which covers astronomy, geography, humans and their technology, medicine, and superstition, as well as animals and plants.

Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions: the humanities (primarily what is now known as classics) and divinity, with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment. The study of nature revived in the Renaissance, and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge, itself divided into descriptive natural history and natural philosophy, the analytical study of nature. In modern terms, natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern physics and chemistry, while natural history included the biological and geological sciences. The two were strongly associated. During the heyday of the gentleman scientists, many people contributed to both fields, and early papers in both were commonly read at professional science society meetings such as the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences—both founded during the 17th century.

Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives, such as Linnaeus&#x27; aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden. Similarly, the Industrial Revolution prompted the development of geology to help find useful mineral deposits.

===Since 1900===
Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources, and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field, creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them. For example, while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study, it can also be defined as a body of knowledge, and as a craft or a practice, in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed.

Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment, as seen in this definition by Marston Bates: &quot;Natural history is the study of animals and Plants—of organisms. ... I like to think, then, of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual—of what plants and animals do, how they react to each other and their environment, how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities&quot; and this more recent definition by D.S. Wilcove and T. Eisner: &quot;The close observation of organisms—their origins, their evolution, their behavior, and their relationships with other species&quot;.

This focus on organisms in their environment is also echoed by H.W. Greene and J.B. Losos: &quot;Natural history focuses on where organisms are and what they do in their environment, including interactions with other organisms. It encompasses changes in internal states insofar as they pertain to what organisms do&quot;.

Some definitions go further, focusing on direct observation of organisms in their environments, both past and present, such as this one by G.A. Bartholomew: &quot;A student of natural history, or a naturalist, studies the world by observing plants and animals directly. Because organisms are functionally inseparable from the environment in which they live and because their structure and function cannot be adequately interpreted without knowing some of their evolutionary history, the study of natural history embraces the study of fossils as well as physiographic and other aspects of the physical environment&quot;.

A common thread in many definitions of natural history is the inclusion of a descriptive component, as seen in a recent definition by H.W. Greene: &quot;Descriptive ecology and ethology&quot;. Several authors have argued for a more expansive view of natural history, including S. Herman, who defines the field as &quot;the scientific study of plants and animals in their natural environments. It is concerned with levels of organization from the individual organism to the ecosystem, and stresses identification, life history, distribution, abundance, and inter-relationships. It often and appropriately includes an esthetic component&quot;, and T. Fleischner, who defines the field even more broadly, as &quot;A practice of intentional, focused attentiveness and receptivity to the more-than-human world, guided by honesty and accuracy&quot;. These definitions explicitly include the arts in the field of natural history, and are aligned with the broad definition outlined by B. Lopez, who defines the field as the &quot;Patient interrogation of a landscape&quot; while referring to the natural history knowledge of the Eskimo (Inuit).

A slightly different framework for natural history, covering a similar range of themes, is also implied in the scope of work encompassed by many leading natural history museums, which often include elements of anthropology, geology, paleontology, and astronomy along with botany and zoology, or include both cultural and natural components of the world.

The plurality of definitions for this field has been recognized as both a weakness and a strength, and a range of definitions has recently been offered by practitioners in a recent collection of views on natural history.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Prior to the advent of Western science humans were engaged and highly competent in indigenous ways of understanding the more-than-human world that are now referred to as traditional ecological knowledge. 21st century definitions of natural history are inclusive of this understanding, such as this by Thomas Fleischner of the Natural History Institute (Prescott, Arizona):

Natural history – a practice of intentional focused attentiveness and receptivity to the more-than-human world, guided by honesty and accuracy – is the oldest continuous human endeavor. In the evolutionary past of our species, the practice of natural history was essential for our survival, imparting critical information on habits and chronologies of plants and animals that we could eat or that could eat us. Natural history continues to be critical to human survival and thriving. It contributes to our fundamental understanding of how the world works by providing the empirical foundation of natural sciences, and it contributes directly and indirectly to human emotional and physical health, thereby fostering healthier human communities. It also serves as the basis for all conservation efforts, with natural history both informing the science and inspiring the values that drive these.

===Ancient===
As a precursor to Western science, natural history began with Aristotle and other ancient philosophers who analyzed the diversity of the natural world. Natural history was understood by Pliny the Elder to cover anything that could be found in the world, including living things, geology, astronomy, technology, art, and humanity.

 was written between 50 and 70 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides, a Roman physician of Greek origin. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted in the Renaissance, making it one of the longest-lasting of all natural history books.

From the ancient Greeks until the work of Carl Linnaeus and other 18th-century naturalists, a major concept of natural history was the &quot;scala naturae&quot; or Great Chain of Being, an arrangement of minerals, vegetables, more primitive forms of animals, and more complex life forms on a linear scale of supposedly increasing perfection, culminating in our species.

===Medieval===
Natural history was basically static through the Middle Ages in Europe—although in the Arabic and Oriental world, it proceeded at a much brisker pace. From the 13th century, the work of Aristotle was adapted rather rigidly into Christian philosophy, particularly by Thomas Aquinas, forming the basis for natural theology. During the Renaissance, scholars (herbalists and humanists, particularly) returned to direct observation of plants and animals for natural history, and many began to accumulate large collections of exotic specimens and unusual monsters. Leonhart Fuchs was one of the three founding fathers of botany, along with Otto Brunfels and Hieronymus Bock. Other important contributors to the field were Valerius Cordus, Konrad Gesner (), Frederik Ruysch, and Gaspard Bauhin. The rapid increase in the number of known organisms prompted many attempts at classifying and organizing species into taxonomic groups, culminating in the system of the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus.

The British historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham calls Li Shizhen &quot;the &#x27;uncrowned king&#x27; of Chinese naturalists&quot;, and his &quot;Bencao gangmu&quot; &quot;undoubtedly the greatest scientific achievement of the Ming&quot;. His works translated to many languages direct or influence many scholars and researchers.

===Modern===

A significant contribution to English natural history was made by parson-naturalists such as Gilbert White, William Kirby, John George Wood, and John Ray, who wrote about plants, animals, and other aspects of nature. Many of these men wrote about nature to make the natural theology argument for the existence or goodness of God. Since early modern times, however, a great number of women made contributions to natural history, particularly in the field of botany, be it as authors, collectors, or illustrators.

In modern Europe, professional disciplines such as botany, geology, mycology, palaeontology, physiology, and zoology were formed. &quot;Natural history&quot;, formerly the main subject taught by college science professors, was increasingly scorned by scientists of a more specialized manner and relegated to an &quot;amateur&quot; activity, rather than a part of science proper. In Victorian Scotland, the study of natural history was believed to contribute to good mental health. Particularly in Britain and the United States, this grew into specialist hobbies such as the study of birds, butterflies, seashells (malacology/conchology), beetles, and wildflowers; meanwhile, scientists tried to define a unified discipline of biology (though with only partial success, at least until the modern evolutionary synthesis). Still, the traditions of natural history continue to play a part in the study of biology, especially ecology (the study of natural systems involving living organisms and the inorganic components of the Earth&#x27;s biosphere that support them), ethology (the scientific study of animal behavior), and evolutionary biology (the study of the relationships between life forms over very long periods of time), and re-emerges today as integrative organismal biology.

Amateur collectors and natural history entrepreneurs played an important role in building the world&#x27;s large natural history collections, such as the Natural History Museum, London, and the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.

Three of the greatest English naturalists of the 19th century, Henry Walter Bates, Charles Darwin, and Alfred Russel Wallace—who knew each other—each made natural history travels that took years, collected thousands of specimens, many of them new to science, and by their writings both advanced knowledge of &quot;remote&quot; parts of the world—the Amazon basin, the Galápagos Islands, and the Indonesian Archipelago, among others—and in so doing helped to transform biology from a descriptive to a theory-based science.

The understanding of &quot;Nature&quot; as &quot;an organism and not as a mechanism&quot; can be traced to the writings of Alexander von Humboldt (Prussia, 1769–1859). Humboldt&#x27;s copious writings and research were seminal influences for Charles Darwin, Simón Bolívar, Henry David Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir.

==Museums==

Natural history museums, which evolved from cabinets of curiosities, played an important role in the emergence of professional biological disciplines and research programs. Particularly in the 19th century, scientists began to use their natural history collections as teaching tools for advanced students and the basis for their own morphological research.

==Societies==
The term &quot;natural history&quot; alone, or sometimes together with archaeology, forms the name of many national, regional, and local natural history societies that maintain records for animals (including birds (ornithology), insects (entomology) and mammals (mammalogy)), fungi (mycology), plants (botany), and other organisms. They may also have geological and microscopical sections.

Examples of these societies in Britain include the Natural History Society of Northumbria founded in 1829, London Natural History Society (1858), Birmingham Natural History Society (1859), British Entomological and Natural History Society founded in 1872, Glasgow Natural History Society, Manchester Microscopical and Natural History Society established in 1880, Whitby Naturalists&#x27; Club founded in 1913, Scarborough Field Naturalists&#x27; Society and the Sorby Natural History Society, Sheffield, founded in 1918. The growth of natural history societies was also spurred due to the growth of British colonies in tropical regions with numerous new species to be discovered. Many civil servants took an interest in their new surroundings, sending specimens back to museums in the Britain. (See also: Indian natural history)

Societies in other countries include the American Society of Naturalists and Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists.

Professional societies have recognized the importance of natural history and have initiated new sections in their journals specifically for natural history observations to support the discipline. These include &quot;Natural History Field Notes&quot; of &quot;Biotropica&quot;, &quot;The Scientific Naturalist&quot; of &quot;Ecology&quot;, &quot;From the Field&quot; of &quot;Waterbirds&quot;, and the &quot;Natural History Miscellany section&quot; of the &quot;American Naturalist&quot;.

==Benefits of Natural History==
Natural history observations have contributed to scientific questioning and theory formation. In recent times such observations contribute to how conservation priorities are determined. Mental health benefits can ensue, as well, from regular and active observation of chosen components of nature, and these reach beyond the benefits derived from passively walking through natural areas.

<doc id="166383" wikidata="Q3444510" url="?curid=166383" title="Lime Grove Studios">
<text>Lime Grove Studios was a film, and later television, studio complex in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, West London, England.

The complex was built by the Gaumont Film Company in 1915. It was situated in Lime Grove, a residential street in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, and when it first opened was described by Gaumont as &quot;the finest studio in Great Britain and the first building ever put up in this country solely for the production of films&quot;. Many Gainsborough Pictures films were made here from the early 1930s. Its sister studio was Islington Studios, also used by Gainsborough; films were often shot partly at Islington and partly at Lime Grove.

In 1949, the complex was purchased by the BBC, who used it for television broadcasts until 1991. It was demolished in 1993.

==Gaumont-British Picture Corporation==
In 1922, Isidore Ostrer along with brothers Mark and Maurice, acquired control of Gaumont-British from its French parent. In 1932 a major redevelopment of Lime Grove Studios was completed, creating one of the best equipped sound studio complexes of that era. The first film produced at the remodelled studio was the Walter Forde thriller &quot;Rome Express&quot; (1932), which became one of the first British sound films to gain critical and financial success in the United States (where it was distributed by Universal Pictures).

The studios prospered under Gaumont-British, and in 1941 were bought by the Rank Organisation. By then Rank had a substantial interest in Gainsborough Pictures, and &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945), among other Gainsborough melodramas, was shot at Lime Grove.

==BBC studios==
In 1949 the BBC bought Lime Grove Studios as a &quot;temporary measure&quot;—because they were to build Television Centre at nearby White City—and began converting them from film to television use. The BBC studios were ceremonially opened on 21 May 1950 by Violet Attlee (wife of the then prime minister Clement Attlee).

Lime Grove would be used for many BBC Television programmes over the next forty-two years, including: &quot;Quatermass II&quot;; &quot;Andy Pandy&quot;; &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;; &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;; &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;; &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;; &quot;Doctor Who&quot;; &quot;Nationwide&quot;; &quot;Panorama&quot;; and &quot;The Grove Family&quot;, which took its title family from the studios, where it was made. A children&#x27;s magazine-style programme, &quot;Studio E&quot;, was broadcast live from the studio of the same name from 1955 until 1958; it was hosted by Vera McKechnie.

The Queen and Prince Philip visited Lime Grove on 28 October 1953, when they observed production of the variety show &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot;, the quiz show &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?&quot;, and a drama production, &quot;The Disagreeable Man&quot;.

On 20 January 1966, the first edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; from Lime Grove was broadcast, hosted by David Jacobs. The newly successful show had moved south from its original home at Dickenson Road Studios, a converted church building in Manchester, to the larger studio facilities at Lime Grove, where the production could attract a more trendy &quot;Swinging London&quot; studio audience. &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was produced at Lime Grove for three years until the show moved to BBC Television Centre in 1969.

Lime Grove hosted a revolution in British TV when Breakfast Time began broadcasting from there on 17 January 1983, the start of popular daytime television hosted by Frank Bough, Selina Scott and Nick Ross. 

Lime Grove&#x27;s use for programmes outside current affairs declined over time, and later episodes of the continuing series were made at BBC Television Centre and BBC Elstree Centre. Indeed, in Lime Grove Studios&#x27; final years, its official name was Lime Grove Current Affairs Production Centre.

Humble Pie performed Desperation, a Steppenwolf single from the debut albums of both: Steppenwolf and Humble Pie; Natural Born Bugie, their debut single; Heartbeat, a Buddy Holly single, and; The Sad Bag of Shaky Jake, their second single, for a recording-and-broadcast for the BBC. Led Zeppelin performed White Summer and Black Mountain Side there, on &quot;The Julie Felix Show&quot;, on 23 April 1970.

In 1991 the BBC decided to consolidate its London television production at the nearby BBC Television Centre and to close its other studios including Lime Grove. The last live programme to be broadcast from Lime Grove was &quot;The Late Show&quot; on 13 June 1991 from Studio D, although the final portion of the programme, with a symbolic &quot;unplugging&quot; of a camera power cord in Studio D by Cliff Michelmore, was pre-recorded.

On 26 August 1991, a month after the studios were closed, the BBC transmitted a special day of programming called &quot;The Lime Grove Story&quot;, featuring examples of the many programmes and films that had been made at Lime Grove in its 76 years as a place of film and television production. BBC Television Theatre close by, near Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, reverted to being the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire.

By the end, the building was in such a poor state of repair that the remaining BBC staff nicknamed it &quot;Slime Grove&quot;. The building was put on the market and eventually bought by a development company, Notting Hill Housing Association, which demolished the studios in 1993, and redeveloped the site into a housing estate. The streets in the estate were named Gaumont Terrace and Gainsborough Court, in memory of the past owners of Lime Grove Studios.

==In popular culture==
Lime Grove Studios was the setting for the fictional current affairs programme &quot;The Hour&quot; in the BBC drama of the same name. The studios are also represented in the 2013 drama &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot; which was shot at Wimbledon Studios.

==Quotes==
On the topic of the Great Famine of Ireland:

*&quot;These same apologists feel that there was nothing that any government could have done to ameliorate the situation. The poor British tried, but were simply overwhelmed by the logistics of the operation. In their view the starvation was the inevitable outcome of demography and the prevalent economic theory of the day.&quot; (From &quot;The Great Starvation and British Imperialism in Ireland.&quot;)

<text>Caddie is a mid-range computer-assisted draughting (CAD) software package for 2D and 3D design. It is used primarily by architects, but has tools for surveyors and mechanical, civil and construction engineers. It was initially designed as an electronic drawing board, using concepts and tools clearly related to a physical board.

Caddie requires a USB dongle. or software activation. Without the dongle or activation, the program can be used as a viewer and plot station for any DWG drawings, but it can&#x27;t save drawings after the 14-day evaluation has expired. Caddie works on Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 and Windows 11.

== Version history ==
Caddie was created by Anthony Spruyt, an architect from Pretoria, South Africa, in 1985 and was originally called Michael Angelo. The first release version was called Caddie and fit on a single 360 kB floppy disk, and was designed for the IBM Personal Computer XT. Caddie was one of the first CAD tools that utilised microcomputers and did not require a mainframe computer with workstation access. Version 1 of Caddie was released in 1986, for MS-DOS. The first version for Microsoft Windows (16-bit) was released in September 1993. The 32-bit Windows version was released in May 1997.

Version 6 was available by 2000. In the same year, a lite version of Caddie was available, called Caddie Budget, with the non-lite version being called Caddie Professional. Version 7 was available in 2001. Caddy Budget Architectural 7 retailed in the UK for £595 in 2003. Version 9 was released in January 2003. Caddie initially used its own proprietary file format .DRW (binary) and an ASCII .CEX (Caddie Exchange format). Caddie could also import and export native AutoCad .DWG and .DXF file formats, but since version 10, Caddie rewrote its core kernels and now uses as native file format OpenDWG.

Version 10 was released in March 2005. Version 11 was released in January 2007 and was the first version compatible with Windows Vista. Caddie 12 was released in September 2008.

The latest version of Caddie is version 29, released on 6 October 2029. There are four versions of the product, namely Caddie Professional (the full version), Caddie Budget (the lite version), Caddie Vio (for photo-realistic rendering, based on Lightworks,) and Caddie Educational, which is licensed to students even though it has all the functionality of Caddie Professional.

== Functionality ==
Caddie Professional and Caddie Educational contain the following applications:

Caddie - the main drawing application with tools for creation and editing of common entities such as lines, arcs, construction lines, splines, ellipses, images, blocks, ole objects etc.

AEC - the smart tools for creation and editing of 2D and 3D Architectural, Engineering And Construction intelligent objects such as walls, windows, doors, openings, slabs, roofs, trusses etc. These intelligent objects have different representations depending on the view.

DTM - the digital terrain modelling tools for creation of TIN models from points or contours. The application includes tools for creation and manipulation of live long and cross sections as well as cut and fill volumes for site development.

Arch applications - country specific applications with additional tools for the creation and editing of Architectural objects, relating to specific regions. For example, the SA Arch module contains tools for doing live SANS 204 Energy efficiency calculations now required when submitting building plans in South Africa.

3D - tools for the creation and manipulation of general purpose 3D primitives. In addition this module has many of the tools required for controlling different 3D views and user coordinate systems.

Mech - automated tools for the creation of commonly drawn mechanical objects such as nuts and bolts, machining and geometrical tolerancing symbols, steel beams and angles, gears, sheet metal developments and welding symbols. The 3D application is where the tools for the optional Vio photo realistic rendering add-on will be found as well as export tools to PovRay.

Survey - an array of tools developed specifically for working with complex construction surveys, unusually equally applicable to southern and northern hemispheres. It includes functionality for spot heights, polar coordinates, coordinate joins, transition curves, height interpolation, helmert transformations, as well as full GPS integration using multiple different coordinate systems.

Civil - tools for the creation of common symbols used on GA drawings, long sections, turning circles pipe layouts etc. as well as tools for sewer, stormwater and electrical layouts.

Steel - tools for standard BS steel sections, bracing, angles and beams. Automatic creation of handrails, catladders, steel stairs, fences and steel trusses including input of data from Prokon.

== Company history ==
Caddie was originally developed in South Africa in 1985, and it quickly established a significant presence in its home market. The product&#x27;s position in South Africa began to erode in the 1990s following the lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa, as other CAD packages entered that market. A Microsoft Windows version of Caddie was not released until 1993.

In 1998, Caddie was acquired by the South African software development company Billcad Holdings. By this time, Caddie had about 11 000 users. In 1999, Billcad became Planit Technology. In early 2001, Planit Technologies went into liquidation.

By March 2002, the British company Advanced Computer Solutions (ACS) bought all the rights from the South African holders and also acquired the Caddie operation within South Africa. ACS was previously Caddie&#x27;s British distributor. ACS has offices in South Africa and the United Kingdom.

<doc id="166392" wikidata="Q239307" url="?curid=166392" title="Margaret Drabble">
<text>Dame Margaret Drabble, Lady Holroyd, (born 5 June 1939) is an English biographer, novelist and short story writer.

Drabble&#x27;s books include &quot;The Millstone&quot; (1965), which won the following year&#x27;s John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize, and &quot;Jerusalem the Golden&quot;, which won the 1967 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. She was honoured by the University of Cambridge in 2006, having earlier received awards from numerous redbrick (e.g. Sheffield, Hull, Manchester,) and plateglass universities (such as Bradford, Keele, East Anglia and York). She received the American Academy of Arts and Letters E. M. Forster Award in 1973.

Drabble also wrote biographies of Arnold Bennett and Angus Wilson and edited two editions of &quot;The Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; and a book on Thomas Hardy.

==Early life==
Drabble was born in Sheffield, the second daughter of the County Court judge and novelist John Frederick Drabble and the teacher Kathleen Marie (&quot;née&quot; Bloor). Her elder sister was the novelist and critic A. S. Byatt; the youngest sister is art historian Helen Langdon, and their brother is the barrister Richard Drabble, KC. Drabble&#x27;s father participated in the placement of Jewish refugees in Sheffield during the 1930s. Her mother was a Shavian and her father a Quaker.

After attending The Mount School, a Quaker boarding school at York where her mother was employed, Drabble received a scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge. She studied English Literature whilst attending Cambridge. She joined the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1960, and, before leaving to pursue a career in literary studies and writing, served as an understudy for Vanessa Redgrave and Diana Rigg.

==Personal life==
Drabble was married to the actor Clive Swift between 1960 and 1975. They had three children, the gardener and TV personality Joe Swift; the academic Adam Swift; and Rebecca Swift (d. 2017), who ran The Literary Consultancy. In 1982, Drabble married the writer and biographer Sir Michael Holroyd; they live in London and Somerset.

Drabble&#x27;s relationship with her sister A. S. Byatt was sometimes strained because of autobiographical elements in both their writing. While their relationship was not especially close and they did not read each other&#x27;s books, Drabble described the situation as &quot;normal sibling rivalry&quot; and Byatt said it had been &quot;terribly overstated by gossip columnists&quot; and that the sisters &quot;always have liked each other on the bottom line.&quot;

When sought out for interview by &quot;The Paris Review&quot;&#x27;s Barbara Milton in 1978, Drabble was described as &quot;smaller than one might expect from looking at her photographs. Her face is finer, prettier and younger, surprisingly young for someone who has produced so many books in the past sixteen years. Her eyes are very clear and attentive and they soften when she is amused, as she often is, by the questions themselves and her own train of thought&quot;. In the same interview she admitted there were three writers for whom she felt an &quot;immense admiration&quot;: Angus Wilson, Saul Bellow and Doris Lessing.

===Views on the 2003 invasion of Iraq===
In the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Drabble wrote of the anticipated wave of anti-Americanism, saying: &quot;My anti-Americanism has become almost uncontrollable. It has possessed me, like a disease. It rises up in my throat like acid reflux, that fashionable American sickness. I now loathe the United States and what it has done to Iraq and the rest of the helpless world&quot;, despite &quot;remembering the many Americans that I know and respect&quot;. She wrote of her distress at images of the war, her objections to Jack Straw about the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and &quot;American imperialism, American infantilism, and American triumphalism about victories it didn&#x27;t even win&quot;. She recalled George Orwell&#x27;s words in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; about &quot;the intoxication of power&quot; and &quot;the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face – for ever&quot;. She closed by saying, &quot;I hate feeling this hatred. I have to keep reminding myself that if Bush hadn&#x27;t been (so narrowly) elected, we wouldn&#x27;t be here, and none of this would have happened. There is another America. Long live the other America, and may this one pass away soon&quot;.

==Writing==
Drabble&#x27;s early novels were published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (1963–87), while the publishers of her later works were Penguin, Viking and Canongate, and a recurring theme is the correlation between contemporary England&#x27;s society and its people. Most of her protagonists are women and the realistic descriptions of her figures often derive from Drabble&#x27;s personal experiences; thus, her first novels describe the life of young women during the 1960s and 1970s, for whom the conflict between motherhood and intellectual challenges is being brought into focus, while &quot;The Witch of Exmoor&quot;, published in 1996, shows the withdrawn existence of an elderly writer. As Hilary Mantel wrote in 1989: &quot;Drabble&#x27;s heroines have aged with her, becoming solid and sour, more prone to drink and swear; yet with each successive book their earnest, moral nature blossoms&quot;. Her characters&#x27; tragic faults reflect their political and economic situation. Drabble wrote novels, she claimed in 2011, &quot;to keep myself company&quot;.

Her first novel, &quot;A Summer Bird-Cage&quot;, was published in 1963. She wrote it, she said, because she had just got married and &quot;the children—I had one and was expecting another—and writing was such a convenient career to combine with having a family&quot;. With it she found her &quot;informal first-person narrative voice&quot;, which she said was an unexpected discovery. She maintained this approach for her first three books, having &quot;liberated myself from the neutral critical prose of the university essay&quot;, which she nevertheless admitted she had enjoyed writing.

Her second novel &quot;The Garrick Year&quot;, published in 1964, drew upon her theatrical experience. Her third novel, &quot;The Millstone&quot;, was published in 1965. About a woman with a baby, Drabble made her character unmarried so as to avoid having to write about marriage or the baby&#x27;s father. She used the personal experience of one of her own children&#x27;s diagnosis with a lesion (a hole in the heart) to inform her writing on the illness she gave the child. Indeed, Drabble herself wrote &quot;The Millstone&quot; whilst pregnant with her own child, that is, her third. On the book&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary in 2015, Tessa Hadley described it as &quot;the seminal 60s feminist novel that Doris Lessing&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Notebook&quot; is always supposed to be&quot;. Drabble admitted, years after writing &quot;The Millstone&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t realise until many years later that some of the medical details I invented were way off the mark&quot;.

Drabble&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;Jerusalem the Golden&quot;, was published in 1967. It is also about an English woman who, not unlike Drabble, is from the north of the country and is attending university in London. Her fifth novel, &quot;The Waterfall&quot;, was published in 1969. It is experimental. Drabble&#x27;s sixth novel, &quot;The Needle&#x27;s Eye&quot;, was published in 1972. It is about an heiress who gives away her inheritance. Her seventh novel &quot;The Realms of Gold&quot;, published in 1975, has a lady archaeologist as its central character. Her eighth novel &quot;The Ice Age&quot;, published in 1977, is set in 1970s England and the social and economic conditions of that time. Drabble&#x27;s ninth novel &quot;The Middle Ground&quot;, published in 1980, has a lady journalist as its central character. Margaret Forster, normally one of her kinder reviewers, called &quot;The Middle Ground&quot; &quot;not a novel but a sociological treatise&quot;.

Her eleventh novel, titled &quot;A Natural Curiosity&quot;, published in 1989, continues the story of characters from her tenth novel, titled &quot;The Radiant Way&quot;, which was published in 1987. Drabble apologised to her readers in a preface to &quot;A Natural Curiosity&quot; and said a sequel had been unintended. Her thirteenth novel &quot;The Witch of Exmoor&quot;, published in 1996, treats of contemporary Britain. Drabble&#x27;s fourteenth novel &quot;The Peppered Moth&quot;, published in 2001, treats of a young girl growing up in a mining town in South Yorkshire and spans four generations of her family. Her fifteenth novel &quot;The Seven Sisters&quot;, published in 2002, is about a woman whose marriage has collapsed and off she goes to Italy. &quot;The Observer&quot; referred to part of her sixteenth novel, &quot;The Red Queen&quot; (published in 2004), as &quot;psychodrabble&quot;, noting her claim in the book&#x27;s preface that she is seeking &quot;universal transcultural human characteristics&quot;. Ursula K. Le Guin compared Drabble&#x27;s seventeenth novel, &quot;The Sea Lady&quot; (published in 2006), favourably with her earlier book &quot;The Needle&#x27;s Eye&quot;. In 2009, Drabble announced she would cease to write fiction, for fear of &quot;repeating herself&quot;. The same year, she published her memoir &quot;The Pattern in the Carpet: A Personal History with Jigsaws&quot;. In addition, two further novels would in fact follow: &quot;The Pure Gold Baby&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Dark Flood Rises&quot; (2016). Speaking in Belfast in 2024, Drabble was clear that &quot;The Dark Flood Rises&quot; was her final novel.

&quot;A Day in the Life of a Smiling Woman,&quot; a collection of the 14 short stories that Drabble published between 1966 and 2000, appeared in 2011. Drabble&#x27;s other writing includes several screenplays, plays and short stories, as well as non-fiction such as &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Britain: Landscape and Literature&quot; and biographies of Arnold Bennett and Angus Wilson. Her critical works include studies of William Wordsworth and Thomas Hardy. She edited two editions of &quot;The Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; in 1985 and 2000.

Drabble served as chairman of the National Book League (now Booktrust) from 1980 until 1982.

==Awards and honours==
Drabble was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in Elizabeth II&#x27;s 1980 Birthday Honours, and was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

<doc id="166393" wikidata="Q2711746" url="?curid=166393" title="Tomas Lindberg">
<text>Tomas Lindberg (born 16 October 1972), also known as &quot;Tompa&quot; and &quot;Goatspell&quot;, is a Swedish vocalist who has fronted many death metal bands, most notably At the Gates. He has been active as a musician and composer since the late 1980s. He also teaches social studies.

Lindberg was ranked number 30 out of 50 of The Greatest Metal Frontmen of All Time by Roadrunner Records.

== Career ==
He started as a vocalist in the band Grotesque under the name Goatspell. When Grotesque fell apart he started melodic death metal band At the Gates. At the Gates broke up after the 1995 release of the highly acclaimed &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; album, but reformed in 2007. In 1995 Lindberg provided vocals for three tracks on Ceremonial Oath&#x27;s &quot;Carpet&quot; while Anders Fridén (In Flames) provided vocals for the other four tracks.

Since then, Lindberg has been involved in many other diverse musical projects within the metal and punk scene. He has fronted Hide, The Crown, Disfear, Skitsystem and the grindcore supergroup Lock Up, in which he performed alongside Napalm Death members Shane Embury (bass) and Jesse Pintado (guitar) and former Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker. He also did vocals for the Gothenburg-based Sacrilege GBG on their 1996 European tour due to the difficulty for drummer/vocalist Daniel Svensson (In Flames) to do both.

He is earning praise for his Gothenburg-based outfit, The Great Deceiver, far removed from his previous work – a product of the Gothenburg melodic death metal scene mixed with influences from artists such as The Cure and Joy Division.

Later on he worked with the band Nightrage, but shortly after their second album Descent into Chaos was released in 2005, Lindberg left the band so that a more full-time vocalist (Antony Hämäläinen) could accompany them on tours and studio albums. Lindberg occasionally provides guest vocals as seen on Darkest Hour&#x27;s &quot;The Sadist Nation&quot;, Transistor Transistor&#x27;s &quot;Young Vampires of New Hampshire&quot; 7&quot;, and on Slowmotion Apocalypse&#x27;s, &quot;The Blessing&quot; on the 2007 &#x27;Obsidian&#x27; album.

Decibel Magazine credits the logo of black metal band Darkthrone as the work of Lindberg.

<text>Aerobics is a form of physical exercise that combines rhythmic aerobic exercise with stretching and strength training routines with the goal of improving all elements of fitness (flexibility, muscular strength, and cardio-vascular fitness). It is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting led by an instructor (fitness professional). With the goal of preventing illness and promoting physical fitness, practitioners perform various routines. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity and will have five components: warm-up (5–10 minutes), cardiovascular conditioning (25–30 minutes), muscular strength and conditioning (10–15 minutes), cool-down (5–8 minutes) and stretching and flexibility (5–8 minutes). Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer different types of aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class.

==History==

Both the term and the specific exercise method were developed by Dr Kenneth H. Cooper, an exercise physiologist, and Col. Pauline Potts, a physical therapist, both of the United States Air Force. Cooper, an exercise enthusiast, was puzzled about why some people with good muscular strength were prone to perform poorly at activities such as long-distance running, swimming, and bicycling. He began using a bicycle ergometer to measure sustained performance in terms of a person&#x27;s ability to use oxygen. In 1968, he published &quot;Aerobics&quot;, which included exercise programs using running, walking, swimming and bicycling. At the time the book was published there was increasing awareness of the need for increased exercise due to widespread weakness and inactivity. Cooper published a mass-market version &quot;The New Aerobics&quot; in 1979.

Aerobic dancing was invented by Jacki Sorensen in 1969, inspired by Cooper&#x27;s book. Sorensen began teaching her method and spreading it throughout the U.S. in the hands of hundreds of instructors in the 1970s. At the same time, Judi Missett&#x27;s Jazzercise was taking off in the form of dance studio franchises in the U.S. Aerobics gained greater popularity, spreading worldwide after the release of &quot;Jane Fonda&#x27;s Workout&quot; video in 1982, sparking an industry boom.

==Step aerobics==

Step aerobics is a form of aerobic exercise that uses a low elevated platform, the step, of height tailored to individual needs by inserting risers. Step aerobics classes are offered at many gyms.

Step aerobics was developed independently by a few American exercise instructors working separately in the mid-1980s, especially Gin Miller and Connie Collins Williams in Atlanta, and Cathe Friedrich in New Jersey. Shoe manufacturer Reebok popularized the exercise method, selling a plastic step unit starting in 1990.

Step aerobics can also be involved in dancing games, such as &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, &quot;In the Groove&quot; and &quot;Wii Fit&quot;.

===Moves and techniques===
Often moves are referred to as Reebok step moves.

The &quot;basic&quot; step involves raising one foot onto the step, then the other so that they are both on the step, then stepping the first foot back, followed by the second. A &quot;right basic&quot; would involve stepping right foot up, then the left, then returning to the floor alternating right then left.

Some instructors switch immediately between different moves, for example between a right basic and a left basic without any intervening moves, effectively &quot;tapping&quot; the foot without shifting weight; tap-free or smooth stepping alternates the feet without &quot;taps&quot;
Common moves include:

*Basic Step
*Corner knee (or corner kick)
*Repeater knee (aka Triple knee)
*T-Step
*Over-the-Top
*Lunges
*V-Step
*Straddle Down
*L-Step
*Split Step
*I-Step

===Choreography===
Many instructors will prepare a set of moves that will be executed together to form the choreography of the class. Usually, the choreography will be timed to 32 beats in a set, ideally switching legs so that the set can be repeated in a mirrored fashion. A set may consist of many different moves and the different moves may have different durations. For example, a basic step as described above takes 4 beats (for the 4 steps the person takes). Similarly, the &quot;knee up&quot; move also takes 4 beats. Another common move, the repeater knee, is an 8-beat move.

Classes vary in the level of choreography. Basic level classes will tend to have a series of relatively basic moves strung together into a sequence. More advanced classes incorporate dance elements such as turns, mambos, and stomps. These elements are put together into 2–3 routines in each class. One learns the routines during the class and then all are performed at the end of the class. Regardless of the complexity of the choreography, most instructors offer various options for different levels of intensity/dance ability while teaching the routines.

==Aerobic dances==
Aerobic dances are musical fitness routines in which an instructor choreographs several short dance combinations and teaches them to a class. This is usually achieved by teaching the class one to two movements at a time and repeating the movements until the class is able to join the whole choreography together. Popular music is used throughout the class. This is sometimes followed by a strength section which uses body weight exercises to strengthen muscles and a stretch routine to cool down and improve flexibility. Classes are usually 30–60 minutes in length and may include the use of equipment such as a barbell, aerobic step, or small weights.

In freestyle aerobics, the instructor choreographs the routine and adjusts it to the needs and wants of their class. There is often no difference between base movements in freestyle and pre-choreographed programs.

It is practiced to improve cardio and strength.

==Aerobic gymnastics== 
Aerobic gymnastics, also known as sport aerobics and competitive aerobics, may combine complicated choreography, rhythmic and acrobatic gymnastics with elements of aerobics. Performance is divided into categories by age, sex and groups (individual, mixed pairs and trios) and are judged on the following elements: dynamic and static strength, jumps and leaps, kicks, balance and flexibility. Ten exercises are mandatory: four consecutive high leg kicks, patterns. A maximum of ten elements from following families are allowed: push-ups, supports and balances, kicks and splits, jumps and leaps. Elements of tumbling such as handsprings, handstands, back flips, and aerial somersaults are prohibited. Scoring is by judging of artistic quality, creativity, execution, and difficulty of routines. Sport aerobics has state, national, and international competitions, but is not an Olympic sport.

<text>Ealing Studios is a television and film production company and facilities provider at Ealing Green in west London, England. Will Barker bought the White Lodge on Ealing Green in 1902 as a base for film making, and films have been made on the site ever since. It is the oldest continuously working studio facility for film production in the world, and the current stages were opened for the use of sound in 1931.

It is best known for a series of classic films produced in the post-WWII years, including &quot;Saraband for Dead Lovers&quot; (1948), &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949), &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949), &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955). The BBC owned and filmed at the Studios for forty years from 1955 until 1995.

Since 2000, Ealing Studios has resumed releasing films under its own name, including the revived &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; franchise. In more recent times, films shot there include &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (2002) and &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), as well as &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; (2014), &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; (2014), &quot;Burnt&quot; (2015) and &quot;Devs&quot; (2020). Interior scenes of the British period drama television series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; were shot in Stage 2 of the studios. The Met Film School London operates on the site.

== History ==

=== Film studios (1902–1955) ===
The site was first occupied by Will Barker Studios from 1902. From 1929, it was acquired by theatre producer Basil Dean, who founded Associated Talking Pictures Ltd. He was joined on the management level by Stephen Courtauld and Reginald Baker. In 1931, they built Ealing Studios, transferring all production there in December of that year. When Dean left in 1938 to be replaced by Michael Balcon from MGM, about 60 films had been made at the studios. Balcon discontinued the ATP name and began to issue films under the Ealing Studios name. In 1944, the company was taken over by the Rank Organisation.

In the 1930s and 1940s, the facility as ATP and then Ealing Studios produced many comedies with stars such as Gracie Fields, George Formby, Stanley Holloway and Will Hay, who had established their reputations in other spheres of entertainment. The company was also instrumental in the use of documentary film-makers to make more realistic war films. These included &quot;Went the Day Well?&quot; (1942), &quot;The Foreman Went to France&quot; (1942), &quot;Undercover&quot; (1943), and &quot;San Demetrio London&quot; (1943). In 1945, the studio made its chiller compendium &quot;Dead of Night&quot;.

In the post-war period, the company embarked on a series of comedies which became the studio&#x27;s hallmark. These were often lightly satirical and were seen to reflect aspects of British character and society. The first was &quot;Hue and Cry&quot; (1947) and the last &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; (1956).

The best remembered Ealing films were produced between 1948 and 1955: &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; (1949), &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949), &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949), &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951), &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; (1951), &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1953), &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955) are all regarded as classics of British cinema.

=== Owned by the BBC (1955–1993) ===
The BBC bought the studios on Ealing Green in 1955, for £300,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb/93789&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; though productions bearing the Ealing name continued to be made at the MGM British Studios at Borehamwood for two years. Balcon later said of the MGM-Ealing partnership &quot;Personally it was a happy relationship. But I do wish I had realised at the outset how absolutely vital it is to make films with mass appeal in America - by which I don&#x27;t mean lowering standards but rather finding the right subjects.&quot;

In 1958, Associated British Picture Corporation acquired Ealing’s parent company, Associated Talking Pictures, together with its extensive film library. The BBC based its Film Department at the studios; and at its peak 56 film crews used the studios as a base for location filming of dramas, documentaries and other programmes; shot on 16 mm and occasionally 35 mm film. Led by a director, these crews usually consisted of a Lighting Cameraman, a camera assistant, a lighting technician (known as a &#x27;spark&#x27;), and a sound recordist. Initially these crews were equipped with Arriflex ST cameras and EMI L2 quarter inch tape recorders that had to be tethered to one another with a physical sync cable to ensure the picture and sound ran in lock. In later years, Eclair NPR cameras replaced the Arriflex machines and Nagra tape recorders replaced the EMI units. The Nagras made use of &#x27;crystal sync&#x27;, a system that provided synchronisation between the camera and the tape recorder remotely, removing the need for a physical cable. There were also over 50 cutting rooms, equipped with Steenbeck editing tables, working on every genre except News and Current Affairs. The editing suites came complete with movable film trim bins and Acmade picsyncs (picture synchronisers) for synchronising the film and sound rushes, and working with the edited cutting copy. The latter was especially useful when splitting the sound track(s) and adding additional effects, atmospheres, music and commentary tracks in readiness for film dubbing.

Many programmes came out of Ealing from Alistair Cooke&#x27;s edited by Alan Tyrer and photographed by Kenneth MacMillan to &quot;Z-Cars&quot; edited by Shelia Tomlinson and many others and &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; edited by Roy Watts, assisted by Roger Waugh. These programmes had post production support, viewing theatres, transfer suites, dubbing theatre, maintenance; all these staff and the film crews made up what was fondly known as the TFS Family.

It was not unknown for major international film stars to visit the studios during BBC Television days. Shortly after &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1976) was released in London on 31 March 1977, Michael Caine was present at the studios during his promotional tour for the film. Apart from the regular production staff and technicians involved with filming the associated interview, at his table in the studio canteen he was surrounded by a large entourage of followers during the obligatory break period.

In the 1980s, the BBC developed and expanded the use of electronic PSC (Portable Single Camera) location equipment and the use of 16 mm film on location gradually declined. The BBC also used the studio facilities at Ealing for filmed inserts where an electronic studio could not be used, such as for the excavation site in &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958–59), &quot;The White Rabbit&quot; (TV mini-series, 1967), &quot;Colditz&quot; (1972–74) and the communal sequences in &quot;Porridge&quot; (1974–77). Programmes wholly shot on film were made there also, such as &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1966), &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (1986), &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot; (1986), and &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; (1987).

The BBC had preview theatres to run 16 mm sepmag film and 35 mm. The 16 mm machines were Bauer and the 35 mm projectors Kalee 21. The projection area was a long room (open plan) with projectors serving theatres E -J. There was a separate projection room in the same area for theatre K, which was 35 mm. There was also a dubbing theatre B, where 16 mm productions would be dubbed, and film dispatch and sound transfer suites, where the quarter-inch tape from Nagra tape machines would be transferred to 16 mm magnetic film. Film previews ran rushes, cutting copies, synch rushes, answer prints and transmission prints before going to telecine.

Television Film Studios was also the home before, during and after 1977, of the BBC TV Film Technical &amp; Training Section run by the Senior Assistant, Training, Frank A. Brown. Courses were based in a lecture room at the studios, typically lasting 6 weeks, and comprised both theoretical training, with extensive information-sheet documentation being provided, plus day excursions for practical experience sessions to film cutting rooms, a film dubbing theatre and the Rank Film Laboratories at Denham (where a considerable quantity of BBC TV film programme content was processed and printed). The courses provided instruction to trainees, culminating in a written theory test, with each either being tailored to film photography, film sound or film editing skills for incoming trainees in these departments. The BBC Engineering Training Department, for training in video work and all aspects where a detailed knowledge of electronics is essential, has, alternatively, been based at Wood Norton Hall, Evesham.

=== Owned by BBRK (1993–1994) ===
With the BBC seeking to reduce costs and in particular studio facilities, a decision was taken to sell Ealing Studios on the open market. In 1993, a sale,&lt;ref name=&quot;variety/1993/ealing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for 6 million pounds, was agreed with &quot;BBRK Group Limited&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;upi/1994/10/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a group of special effects businesses,&lt;ref name=&quot;independent/5364491&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; chaired by David Malcolm Bill,&lt;ref name=&quot;endole/dmb&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a former advertising art director.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent/3968576&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994 to present ===
The BBC had inserted a buy-back clause so that in the event that BBRK (for whatever reasons) put the site up for sale then the BBC would have first option to purchase. In 1994,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1994/03/27&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 18 months later,&lt;ref name=&quot;independent/1444004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; BBRK found it necessary to sell the site and the BBC repurchased the site and sold it on for £1.00 to the National Film and Television School, (NFTS).&lt;ref name=&quot;TVsh/ealing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2000, the studios were sold again to a consortium led by Fragile Films&#x27; Uri Fruchtmann and Barnaby Thompson, Harry Handelsman and John Kao, with an intention to revive the fortunes of the studio. Handelsman&#x27;s Manhattan Loft Corporation redeveloped the 3.8-acre site to include the existing Grade II listed sound stages. The studio has since begun to produce theatrical films again, such as &quot;Lucky Break&quot; (2001), &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (2002), and &quot;Valiant&quot; (2005). &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; and horror film &quot;The Descent&quot; (2005) were both shot on the lot.

In 2007, Ealing revived the St Trinian&#x27;s franchise, the second film, &quot;St. Trinian&#x27;s, The Legend of Fritton&#x27;s Gold&quot; was released in December 2009 and took over £7 million at the UK Box Office. Between these, Ealing released &quot;Easy Virtue&quot; (2008), directed by Stephan Elliott and &quot;Dorian Gray&quot; (2009), directed by Oliver Parker.

Ealing Studios is used by the Met Film School London, which has a purpose-built film school on the lot and use of the studios. ITV drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; filmed the kitchen and servants&#x27; quarters on stages 3A and 3B.
The studio is also home to The Imaginarium, a production company and studio specializing in performance-capture, founded by Andy Serkis and Jonathan Cavendish.

<text>Rüdiger &quot;Rudi&quot; Dornbusch (June 8, 1942 – July 25, 2002) was a German economist who worked in the United States for most of his career.

== Early life and education ==
Dornbusch was born in Krefeld in 1942. After completing his secondary education at the Gymnasium am Moltkeplatz, he studied political science at the University of Geneva, and received his undergraduate degree (&quot;licence en sciences politiques&quot;) from the Graduate Institute of International Studies in 1966. He went on to graduate study at the University of Chicago, receiving an MA in economics in 1966, and a PhD in economics in 1971.

== Career ==
He lectured briefly at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, before serving as an assistant professor at the University of Rochester for two years; he then returned to Chicago, where he served as a professor of international economics. In 1975, he moved to MIT, where he was appointed an associate professor in the Department of Economics, and was made a full professor in 1984. He stayed at MIT until his death in 2002.

Throughout his career his main focus was on international economics, especially monetary policy, macroeconomic development, growth and international trade. According to some of his students and associates his talent was to extract the heart of a problem and make it understandable in simple terms. For example, he explained fluctuations in prices and exchange rates with great clarity (notably with his overshooting model). He succeeded in making a more realistic model than Mundell–Fleming model with regard to a small open economic system, considering exchange rate expectations. He worked also for the International Monetary Fund, contributing to the development of stabilisation policies, especially for Latin American countries. Along with Sebastián Edwards he coined the term macroeconomic populism. For more than 15 years he served as an associate editor of the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot;.

Together with Stanley Fischer he also wrote widely used undergraduate textbooks.

He died, aged sixty, from cancer.

<doc id="166404" wikidata="Q179380" url="?curid=166404" title="First law of thermodynamics">
<text>The first law of thermodynamics is a formulation of the law of conservation of energy in the context of thermodynamic processes. The law distinguishes two principal forms of energy transfer, heat and thermodynamic work, that modify a thermodynamic system containing a constant amount of matter. The law also defines the internal energy of a system, an extensive property for taking account of the balance of heat and work in the system. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed from one form to another. In an isolated system the sum of all forms of energy is constant.

An equivalent statement is that perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible; work done by a system on its surroundings requires that the system&#x27;s internal energy be consumed, so that the amount of internal energy lost by that work must be resupplied as heat by an external energy source or as work by an external machine acting on the system to sustain the work of the system continuously.

The ideal isolated system, of which the entire universe is an example, is often only used as a model. Many systems in practical applications require the consideration of internal chemical or nuclear reactions, as well as transfers of matter into or out of the system. For such considerations, thermodynamics also defines the concept of open systems, closed systems, and other types.

==Definition==
For thermodynamic processes of energy transfer without transfer of matter, the first law of thermodynamics is often expressed by the algebraic sum of contributions to the internal energy, formula_1, from all work, formula_2, done on or by the system, and the quantity of heat, formula_3, supplied or withdrawn from the system. The historical sign convention for the terms has been that heat supplied &quot;to&quot; the system is positive, but work done &quot;by&quot; the system is subtracted. This was the convention of Rudolf Clausius, so that a change in the internal energy, formula_4, is written

:formula_5.

Modern formulations, such as by Max Planck, and by IUPAC, often replace the subtraction with addition, and consider all net energy transfers to the system as positive and all net energy transfers from the system as negative, irrespective of the use of the system, for example as an engine.

When a system expands in an isobaric process, the thermodynamic work, formula_2, done &quot;by&quot; the system on the surroundings is the product, formula_7, of system pressure, formula_8, and system volume change, formula_9, whereas formula_10 is said to be the thermodynamic work done &quot;on&quot; the system by the surroundings. The change in internal energy of the system is:

:formula_11

where formula_3 denotes the quantity of heat supplied to the system from its surroundings.

Work and heat express physical processes of supply or removal of energy, while the internal energy formula_1 is a mathematical abstraction that keeps account of the changes of energy that befall the system. The term formula_3 is the quantity of energy added or removed as heat in the thermodynamic sense, not referring to a form of energy within the system. Likewise, formula_2 denotes the quantity of energy gained or lost through thermodynamic work. Internal energy is a property of the system, while work and heat describe the process, not the system. Thus, a given internal energy change, formula_4, can be achieved by different combinations of heat and work. Heat and work are said to be &quot;path dependent&quot;, while change in internal energy depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path between. Thermodynamic work is measured by change in the system, and is not necessarily the same as work measured by forces and distances in the surroundings, though, ideally, such can sometimes be arranged; this distinction is noted in the term &#x27;isochoric work&#x27;, at constant system volume, with formula_17, which is not a form of thermodynamic work.

==History==
In the first half of the eighteenth century, French philosopher and mathematician Émilie du Châtelet made notable contributions to the emerging theoretical framework of energy, for example by emphasising Leibniz&#x27;s concept of &#x27; &quot;vis viva&quot; &#x27;, &quot;mv2&quot;, as distinct from Newton&#x27;s momentum, &quot;mv&quot;.

Empirical developments of the early ideas, in the century following, wrestled with contravening concepts such as the caloric theory of heat.

In the few years of his life (1796–1832) after the 1824 publication of his book &quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire&quot;, Sadi Carnot came to understand that the caloric theory of heat was restricted to mere calorimetry, and that heat and &quot;motive power&quot; are interconvertible. This is known only from his posthumously published notes. He wrote:

At that time, the concept of mechanical work had not been formulated. Carnot was aware that heat could be produced by friction and by percussion, as forms of dissipation of &quot;motive power&quot;. As late as 1847, Lord Kelvin believed in the caloric theory of heat, being unaware of Carnot&#x27;s notes.

In 1840, Germain Hess stated a conservation law (Hess&#x27;s law) for the &quot;heat of reaction&quot; during chemical transformations. This law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics, but Hess&#x27;s statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work.

In 1842, Julius Robert von Mayer made a statement that was rendered by Clifford Truesdell (1980) as &quot;in a process at constant pressure, the heat used to produce expansion is universally interconvertible with work&quot;, but this is not a general statement of the first law, for it does not express the concept of the thermodynamic state variable, the internal energy. Also in 1842, Mayer measured a temperature rise caused by friction in a body of paper pulp. This was near the time of the 1842–1845 work of James Prescott Joule, measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. In 1845, Joule published a paper entitled &quot;The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat&quot;, in which he specified a numerical value for the amount of mechanical work required to &quot;produce a unit of heat&quot;, based on heat production by friction in the passage of electricity through a resistor and in the rotation of a paddle in a vat of water.

The first full statements of the law came in 1850 from Rudolf Clausius, and from William Rankine. Some scholars consider Rankine&#x27;s statement less distinct than that of Clausius. 

===Original statements: the &quot;thermodynamic approach&quot;===
The original 19th-century statements of the first law appeared in a conceptual framework in which transfer of energy as heat was taken as a primitive notion, defined by calorimetry. It was presupposed as logically prior to the theoretical development of thermodynamics. Jointly primitive with this notion of heat were the notions of empirical temperature and thermal equilibrium. This framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work. This framework did not presume a concept of energy in general, but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work. By one author, this framework has been called the &quot;thermodynamic&quot; approach.

The first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics, by Rudolf Clausius in 1850, referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes, and to the existence of a function of state of the system, the internal energy. He expressed it in terms of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process. This equation may be described as follows:

Reflecting the experimental work of Mayer and of Joule, Clausius wrote:
Because of its definition in terms of increments, the value of the internal energy of a system is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an arbitrary additive constant of integration, which can be adjusted to give arbitrary reference zero levels. This non-uniqueness is in keeping with the abstract mathematical nature of the internal energy. The internal energy is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system.

The concept of internal energy is considered by Bailyn to be of &quot;enormous interest&quot;. Its quantity cannot be immediately measured, but can only be inferred, by differencing actual immediate measurements. Bailyn likens it to the energy states of an atom, that were revealed by Bohr&#x27;s energy relation . In each case, an unmeasurable quantity (the internal energy, the atomic energy level) is revealed by considering the difference of measured quantities (increments of internal energy, quantities of emitted or absorbed radiative energy).

===Conceptual revision: the &quot;mechanical approach&quot;===
In 1907, George H. Bryan wrote about systems between which there is no transfer of matter (closed systems): &quot;Definition. When energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work, the energy so transferred is called &quot;heat&quot;.&quot; This definition may be regarded as expressing a conceptual revision, as follows. This reinterpretation was systematically expounded in 1909 by Constantin Carathéodory, whose attention had been drawn to it by Max Born. Largely through Born&#x27;s influence, this revised conceptual approach to the definition of heat came to be preferred by many twentieth-century writers. It might be called the &quot;mechanical approach&quot;.

Energy can also be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another in association with transfer of matter. Born points out that in general such energy transfer is not resolvable uniquely into work and heat moieties. In general, when there is transfer of energy associated with matter transfer, work and heat transfers can be distinguished only when they pass through walls physically separate from those for matter transfer.

The &quot;mechanical&quot; approach postulates the law of conservation of energy. It also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another adiabatically as work, and that energy can be held as the internal energy of a thermodynamic system. It also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-adiabatic, and is unaccompanied by matter transfer. Initially, it &quot;cleverly&quot; (according to Martin Bailyn) refrains from labelling as &#x27;heat&#x27; such non-adiabatic, unaccompanied transfer of energy. It rests on the primitive notion of &quot;walls&quot;, especially adiabatic walls and non-adiabatic walls, defined as follows. Temporarily, only for purpose of this definition, one can prohibit transfer of energy as work across a wall of interest. Then walls of interest fall into two classes, (a) those such that arbitrary systems separated by them remain independently in their own previously established respective states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium; they are defined as adiabatic; and (b) those without such independence; they are defined as non-adiabatic.

This approach derives the notions of transfer of energy as heat, and of temperature, as theoretical developments, not taking them as primitives. It regards calorimetry as a derived theory. It has an early origin in the nineteenth century, for example in the work of Hermann von Helmholtz, but also in the work of many others.

==Conceptually revised statement, according to the mechanical approach==
The revised statement of the first law postulates that a change in the internal energy of a system due to any arbitrary process, that takes the system from a given initial thermodynamic state to a given final equilibrium thermodynamic state, can be determined through the physical existence, for those given states, of a reference process that occurs purely through stages of adiabatic work.

The revised statement is then

::For a closed system, in any arbitrary process of interest that takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, the change of internal energy is the same as that for a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states. This is so regardless of the path of the process of interest, and regardless of whether it is an adiabatic or a non-adiabatic process. The reference adiabatic work process may be chosen arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes.

This statement is much less close to the empirical basis than are the original statements, but is often regarded as conceptually parsimonious in that it rests only on the concepts of adiabatic work and of non-adiabatic processes, not on the concepts of transfer of energy as heat and of empirical temperature that are presupposed by the original statements. Largely through the influence of Max Born, it is often regarded as theoretically preferable because of this conceptual parsimony. Born particularly observes that the revised approach avoids thinking in terms of what he calls the &quot;imported engineering&quot; concept of heat engines.

Basing his thinking on the mechanical approach, Born in 1921, and again in 1949, proposed to revise the definition of heat. In particular, he referred to the work of Constantin Carathéodory, who had in 1909 stated the first law without defining quantity of heat. Born&#x27;s definition was specifically for transfers of energy without transfer of matter, and it has been widely followed in textbooks (examples:). Born observes that a transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that cannot be resolved into heat and work components. There can be pathways to other systems, spatially separate from that of the matter transfer, that allow heat and work transfer independent of and simultaneous with the matter transfer. Energy is conserved in such transfers.

==Description==
===Cyclic processes===
The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system was expressed in two ways by Clausius. One way referred to cyclic processes and the inputs and outputs of the system, but did not refer to increments in the internal state of the system. The other way referred to an incremental change in the internal state of the system, and did not expect the process to be cyclic.

A cyclic process is one that can be repeated indefinitely often, returning the system to its initial state. Of particular interest for single cycle of a cyclic process are the net work done, and the net heat taken in (or &#x27;consumed&#x27;, in Clausius&#x27; statement), by the system.

In a cyclic process in which the system does net work on its surroundings, it is observed to be physically necessary not only that heat be taken into the system, but also, importantly, that some heat leave the system. The difference is the heat converted by the cycle into work. In each repetition of a cyclic process, the net work done by the system, measured in mechanical units, is proportional to the heat consumed, measured in calorimetric units.

The constant of proportionality is universal and independent of the system and in 1845 and 1847 was measured by James Joule, who described it as the mechanical equivalent of heat.

==Various statements of the law for closed systems==
The law is of great importance and generality and is consequently thought of from several points of view. Most careful textbook statements of the law express it for closed systems. It is stated in several ways, sometimes even by the same author.

For the thermodynamics of closed systems, the distinction between transfers of energy as work and as heat is central and is within the scope of the present article. For the thermodynamics of open systems, such a distinction is beyond the scope of the present article, but some limited comments are made on it in the section below headed &#x27;First law of thermodynamics for open systems&#x27;.

There are two main ways of stating a law of thermodynamics, physically or mathematically. They should be logically coherent and consistent with one another.

An example of a physical statement is that of Planck (1897/1903):

:It is in no way possible, either by mechanical, thermal, chemical, or other devices, to obtain perpetual motion, i.e. it is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a cycle and produce continuous work, or kinetic energy, from nothing.

This physical statement is restricted neither to closed systems nor to systems with states that are strictly defined only for thermodynamic equilibrium; it has meaning also for open systems and for systems with states that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium.

An example of a mathematical statement is that of Crawford (1963):

For a given system we let large-scale mechanical energy, large-scale potential energy, and total energy. The first two quantities are specifiable in terms of appropriate mechanical variables, and by definition

:formula_18

For any finite process, whether reversible or irreversible,

:formula_19

The first law in a form that involves the principle of conservation of energy more generally is

:formula_20

Here and are heat and work added, with no restrictions as to whether the process is reversible, quasistatic, or irreversible.[Warner, &quot;Am. J. Phys.&quot;, 29, 124 (1961)]

This statement by Crawford, for , uses the sign convention of IUPAC, not that of Clausius. Though it does not explicitly say so, this statement refers to closed systems. Internal energy is evaluated for bodies in states of thermodynamic equilibrium, which possess well-defined temperatures, relative to a reference state.

The history of statements of the law for closed systems has two main periods, before and after the work of George H. Bryan (1907), of Carathéodory (1909), and the approval of Carathéodory&#x27;s work given by Born (1921). The earlier traditional versions of the law for closed systems are nowadays often considered to be out of date.

Carathéodory&#x27;s celebrated presentation of equilibrium thermodynamics refers to closed systems, which are allowed to contain several phases connected by internal walls of various kinds of impermeability and permeability (explicitly including walls that are permeable only to heat). Carathéodory&#x27;s 1909 version of the first law of thermodynamics was stated in an axiom which refrained from defining or mentioning temperature or quantity of heat transferred. That axiom stated that the internal energy of a phase in equilibrium is a function of state, that the sum of the internal energies of the phases is the total internal energy of the system, and that the value of the total internal energy of the system is changed by the amount of work done adiabatically on it, considering work as a form of energy. That article considered this statement to be an expression of the law of conservation of energy for such systems. This version is nowadays widely accepted as authoritative, but is stated in slightly varied ways by different authors.

Such statements of the first law for closed systems assert the existence of internal energy as a function of state defined in terms of adiabatic work. Thus heat is not defined calorimetrically or as due to temperature difference. It is defined as a residual difference between change of internal energy and work done on the system, when that work does not account for the whole of the change of internal energy and the system is not adiabatically isolated.

The 1909 Carathéodory statement of the law in axiomatic form does not mention heat or temperature, but the equilibrium states to which it refers are explicitly defined by variable sets that necessarily include &quot;non-deformation variables&quot;, such as pressures, which, within reasonable restrictions, can be rightly interpreted as empirical temperatures, and the walls connecting the phases of the system are explicitly defined as possibly impermeable to heat or permeable only to heat.

According to A. Münster (1970), &quot;A somewhat unsatisfactory aspect of Carathéodory&#x27;s theory is that a consequence of the Second Law must be considered at this point [in the statement of the first law], i.e. that it is not always possible to reach any state 2 from any other state 1 by means of an adiabatic process.&quot; Münster instances that no adiabatic process can reduce the internal energy of a system at constant volume. Carathéodory&#x27;s paper asserts that its statement of the first law corresponds exactly to Joule&#x27;s experimental arrangement, regarded as an instance of adiabatic work. It does not point out that Joule&#x27;s experimental arrangement performed essentially irreversible work, through friction of paddles in a liquid, or passage of electric current through a resistance inside the system, driven by motion of a coil and inductive heating, or by an external current source, which can access the system only by the passage of electrons, and so is not strictly adiabatic, because electrons are a form of matter, which cannot penetrate adiabatic walls. The paper goes on to base its main argument on the possibility of quasi-static adiabatic work, which is essentially reversible. The paper asserts that it will avoid reference to Carnot cycles, and then proceeds to base its argument on cycles of forward and backward quasi-static adiabatic stages, with isothermal stages of zero magnitude.

Sometimes the concept of internal energy is not made explicit in the statement.

Sometimes the existence of the internal energy is made explicit but work is not explicitly mentioned in the statement of the first postulate of thermodynamics. Heat supplied is then defined as the residual change in internal energy after work has been taken into account, in a non-adiabatic process.

A respected modern author states the first law of thermodynamics as &quot;Heat is a form of energy&quot;, which explicitly mentions neither internal energy nor adiabatic work. Heat is defined as energy transferred by thermal contact with a reservoir, which has a temperature, and is generally so large that addition and removal of heat do not alter its temperature. A current student text on chemistry defines heat thus: &quot;&quot;heat&quot; is the exchange of thermal energy between a system and its surroundings caused by a temperature difference.&quot; The author then explains how heat is defined or measured by calorimetry, in terms of heat capacity, specific heat capacity, molar heat capacity, and temperature.

A respected text disregards the Carathéodory&#x27;s exclusion of mention of heat from the statement of the first law for closed systems, and admits heat calorimetrically defined along with work and internal energy. Another respected text defines heat exchange as determined by temperature difference, but also mentions that the Born (1921) version is &quot;completely rigorous&quot;. These versions follow the traditional approach that is now considered out of date, exemplified by that of Planck (1897/1903).

==Evidence for the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems==
The first law of thermodynamics for closed systems was originally induced from empirically observed evidence, including calorimetric evidence. It is nowadays, however, taken to provide the definition of heat via the law of conservation of energy and the definition of work in terms of changes in the external parameters of a system. The original discovery of the law was gradual over a period of perhaps half a century or more, and some early studies were in terms of cyclic processes.

The following is an account in terms of changes of state of a closed system through compound processes that are not necessarily cyclic. This account first considers processes for which the first law is easily verified because of their simplicity, namely adiabatic processes (in which there is no transfer as heat) and adynamic processes (in which there is no transfer as work).

===Adiabatic processes===
In an adiabatic process, there is transfer of energy as work but not as heat. For all adiabatic process that takes a system from a given initial state to a given final state, irrespective of how the work is done, the respective eventual total quantities of energy transferred as work are one and the same, determined just by the given initial and final states. The work done on the system is defined and measured by changes in mechanical or quasi-mechanical variables external to the system. Physically, adiabatic transfer of energy as work requires the existence of adiabatic enclosures.

For instance, in Joule&#x27;s experiment, the initial system is a tank of water with a paddle wheel inside. If we isolate the tank thermally, and move the paddle wheel with a pulley and a weight, we can relate the increase in temperature with the distance descended by the mass. Next, the system is returned to its initial state, isolated again, and the same amount of work is done on the tank using different devices (an electric motor, a chemical battery, a spring...). In every case, the amount of work can be measured independently. The return to the initial state is not conducted by doing adiabatic work on the system. The evidence shows that the final state of the water (in particular, its temperature and volume) is the same in every case. It is irrelevant if the work is electrical, mechanical, chemical... or if done suddenly or slowly, as long as it is performed in an adiabatic way, that is to say, without heat transfer into or out of the system.

Evidence of this kind shows that to increase the temperature of the water in the tank, the qualitative kind of adiabatically performed work does not matter. No qualitative kind of adiabatic work has ever been observed to decrease the temperature of the water in the tank.

A change from one state to another, for example an increase of both temperature and volume, may be conducted in several stages, for example by externally supplied electrical work on a resistor in the body, and adiabatic expansion allowing the body to do work on the surroundings. It needs to be shown that the time order of the stages, and their relative magnitudes, does not affect the amount of adiabatic work that needs to be done for the change of state. According to one respected scholar: &quot;Unfortunately, it does not seem that experiments of this kind have ever been carried out carefully. ... We must therefore admit that the statement which we have enunciated here, and which is equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics, is not well founded on direct experimental evidence.&quot; Another expression of this view is &quot;no systematic precise experiments to verify this generalization directly have ever been attempted&quot;.

This kind of evidence, of independence of sequence of stages, combined with the above-mentioned evidence, of independence of qualitative kind of work, would show the existence of an important state variable that corresponds with adiabatic work, but not that such a state variable represented a conserved quantity. For the latter, another step of evidence is needed, which may be related to the concept of reversibility, as mentioned below.

That important state variable was first recognized and denoted formula_1 by Clausius in 1850, but he did not then name it, and he defined it in terms not only of work but also of heat transfer in the same process. It was also independently recognized in 1850 by Rankine, who also denoted it formula_1 ; and in 1851 by Kelvin who then called it &quot;mechanical energy&quot;, and later &quot;intrinsic energy&quot;. In 1865, after some hesitation, Clausius began calling his state function formula_1 &quot;energy&quot;. In 1882 it was named as the &quot;internal energy&quot; by Helmholtz. If only adiabatic processes were of interest, and heat could be ignored, the concept of internal energy would hardly arise or be needed. The relevant physics would be largely covered by the concept of potential energy, as was intended in the 1847 paper of Helmholtz on the principle of conservation of energy, though that did not deal with forces that cannot be described by a potential, and thus did not fully justify the principle. Moreover, that paper was critical of the early work of Joule that had by then been performed. A great merit of the internal energy concept is that it frees thermodynamics from a restriction to cyclic processes, and allows a treatment in terms of thermodynamic states.

In an adiabatic process, adiabatic work takes the system either from a reference state formula_24 with internal energy formula_25 to an arbitrary one formula_26 with internal energy formula_27, or from the state formula_26 to the state formula_24:

:formula_30

Except under the special, and strictly speaking, fictional, condition of reversibility, only one of the processes formula_31 or formula_32 is empirically feasible by a simple application of externally supplied work. The reason for this is given as the second law of thermodynamics and is not considered in the present article.

The fact of such irreversibility may be dealt with in two main ways, according to different points of view:

The formula () above allows that to go by processes of quasi-static adiabatic work from the state formula_26 to the state formula_34 we can take a path that goes through the reference state formula_24, since the quasi-static adiabatic work is independent of the path

:formula_36

This kind of empirical evidence, coupled with theory of this kind, largely justifies the following statement:

:For all adiabatic processes between two specified states of a closed system of any nature, the net work done is the same regardless the details of the process, and determines a state function called internal energy, formula_1.

===Adynamic processes===

A complementary observable aspect of the first law is about heat transfer. Adynamic transfer of energy as heat can be measured empirically by changes in the surroundings of the system of interest by calorimetry. This again requires the existence of adiabatic enclosure of the entire process, system and surroundings, though the separating wall between the surroundings and the system is thermally conductive or radiatively permeable, not adiabatic. A calorimeter can rely on measurement of sensible heat, which requires the existence of thermometers and measurement of temperature change in bodies of known sensible heat capacity under specified conditions; or it can rely on the measurement of latent heat, through measurement of masses of material that change phase, at temperatures fixed by the occurrence of phase changes under specified conditions in bodies of known latent heat of phase change. The calorimeter can be calibrated by transferring an externally determined amount of heat into it, for instance from a resistive electrical heater inside the calorimeter through which a precisely known electric current is passed at a precisely known voltage for a precisely measured period of time. The calibration allows comparison of calorimetric measurement of quantity of heat transferred with quantity of energy transferred as (surroundings-based) work. According to one textbook, &quot;The most common device for measuring formula_4 is an adiabatic bomb calorimeter.&quot; According to another textbook, &quot;Calorimetry is widely used in present day laboratories.&quot; According to one opinion, &quot;Most thermodynamic data come from calorimetry...&quot;.

When the system evolves with transfer of energy as heat, without energy being transferred as work, in an adynamic process, the heat transferred to the system is equal to the increase in its internal energy:

:formula_39

===General case for reversible processes===
Heat transfer is practically reversible when it is driven by practically negligibly small temperature gradients. Work transfer is practically reversible when it occurs so slowly that there are no frictional effects within the system; frictional effects outside the system should also be zero if the process is to be reversible in the strict thermodynamic sense. For a particular reversible process in general, the work done reversibly on the system, formula_40, and the heat transferred reversibly to the system, formula_41 are not required to occur respectively adiabatically or adynamically, but they must belong to the same particular process defined by its particular reversible path, formula_42, through the space of thermodynamic states. Then the work and heat transfers can occur and be calculated simultaneously.

Putting the two complementary aspects together, the first law for a particular reversible process can be written

:formula_43

This combined statement is the expression the first law of thermodynamics for reversible processes for closed systems.

In particular, if no work is done on a thermally isolated closed system we have

:formula_44.

This is one aspect of the law of conservation of energy and can be stated:

:The internal energy of an isolated system remains constant.

===General case for irreversible processes===
If, in a process of change of state of a closed system, the energy transfer is not under a practically zero temperature gradient, practically frictionless, and with nearly balanced forces, then the process is irreversible. Then the heat and work transfers may be difficult to calculate with high accuracy, although the simple equations for reversible processes still hold to a good approximation in the absence of composition changes. Importantly, the first law still holds and provides a check on the measurements and calculations of the work done irreversibly on the system, formula_45, and the heat transferred irreversibly to the system, formula_46, which belong to the same particular process defined by its particular irreversible path, formula_47, through the space of thermodynamic states.

:formula_48

This means that the internal energy formula_1 is a function of state and that the internal energy change formula_4 between two states is a function only of the two states.

===Overview of the weight of evidence for the law===
The first law of thermodynamics is so general that its predictions cannot all be directly tested. In many properly conducted experiments it has been precisely supported, and never violated. Indeed, within its scope of applicability, the law is so reliably established, that, nowadays, rather than experiment being considered as testing the accuracy of the law, it is more practical and realistic to think of the law as testing the accuracy of experiment. An experimental result that seems to violate the law may be assumed to be inaccurate or wrongly conceived, for example due to failure to account for an important physical factor. Thus, some may regard it as a principle more abstract than a law.

==State functional formulation for infinitesimal processes==
When the heat and work transfers in the equations above are infinitesimal in magnitude, they are often denoted by , rather than exact differentials denoted by , as a reminder that heat and work do not describe the &quot;state&quot; of any system. The integral of an inexact differential depends upon the particular path taken through the space of thermodynamic parameters while the integral of an exact differential depends only upon the initial and final states. If the initial and final states are the same, then the integral of an inexact differential may or may not be zero, but the integral of an exact differential is always zero. The path taken by a thermodynamic system through a chemical or physical change is known as a thermodynamic process.

The first law for a closed homogeneous system may be stated in terms that include concepts that are established in the second law. The internal energy may then be expressed as a function of the system&#x27;s defining state variables , entropy, and , volume: . In these terms, , the system&#x27;s temperature, and , its pressure, are partial derivatives of with respect to and . These variables are important throughout thermodynamics, though not necessary for the statement of the first law. Rigorously, they are defined only when the system is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. For some purposes, the concepts provide good approximations for scenarios sufficiently near to the system&#x27;s internal thermodynamic equilibrium.

The first law requires that:

:formula_51

Then, for the fictive case of a reversible process, can be written in terms of exact differentials. One may imagine reversible changes, such that there is at each instant negligible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium within the system and between system and surroundings. Then, mechanical work is given by and the quantity of heat added can be expressed as . For these conditions

:formula_52

While this has been shown here for reversible changes, it is valid more generally in the absence of chemical reactions or phase transitions, as can be considered as a thermodynamic state function of the defining state variables and :

Equation () is known as the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a closed system in the energy representation, for which the defining state variables are and , with respect to which and are partial derivatives of . It is only in the reversible case or for a quasistatic process without composition change that the work done and heat transferred are given by and .

In the case of a closed system in which the particles of the system are of different types and, because chemical reactions may occur, their respective numbers are not necessarily constant, the fundamental thermodynamic relation for d&quot;U&quot; becomes:

:formula_53

where d&quot;N&quot;i is the (small) increase in number of type-i particles in the reaction, and &quot;μ&quot;i is known as the chemical potential of the type-i particles in the system. If d&quot;N&quot;i is expressed in mol then &quot;μ&quot;i is expressed in J/mol. If the system has more external mechanical variables than just the volume that can change, the fundamental thermodynamic relation further generalizes to:

:formula_54

Here the &quot;X&quot;i are the generalized forces corresponding to the external variables &quot;x&quot;i. The parameters &quot;X&quot;i are independent of the size of the system and are called intensive parameters and the &quot;x&quot;i are proportional to the size and called extensive parameters.

For an open system, there can be transfers of particles as well as energy into or out of the system during a process. For this case, the first law of thermodynamics still holds, in the form that the internal energy is a function of state and the change of internal energy in a process is a function only of its initial and final states, as noted in the section below headed First law of thermodynamics for open systems.

A useful idea from mechanics is that the energy gained by a particle is equal to the force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the particle while that force is applied. Now consider the first law without the heating term: d&quot;U&quot; = −&quot;P&quot; d&quot;V&quot;. The pressure &quot;P&quot; can be viewed as a force (and in fact has units of force per unit area) while d&quot;V&quot; is the displacement (with units of distance times area). We may say, with respect to this work term, that a pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the two (work) is the amount of energy transferred out of the system as a result of the process. If one were to make this term negative then this would be the work done on the system.

It is useful to view the &quot;T&quot; d&quot;S&quot; term in the same light: here the temperature is known as a &quot;generalized&quot; force (rather than an actual mechanical force) and the entropy is a generalized displacement.

Similarly, a difference in chemical potential between groups of particles in the system drives a chemical reaction that changes the numbers of particles, and the corresponding product is the amount of chemical potential energy transformed in process. For example, consider a system consisting of two phases: liquid water and water vapor. There is a generalized &quot;force&quot; of evaporation that drives water molecules out of the liquid. There is a generalized &quot;force&quot; of condensation that drives vapor molecules out of the vapor. Only when these two &quot;forces&quot; (or chemical potentials) are equal is there equilibrium, and the net rate of transfer zero.

The two thermodynamic parameters that form a generalized force-displacement pair are called &quot;conjugate variables&quot;. The two most familiar pairs are, of course, pressure-volume, and temperature-entropy.

== Fluid dynamics ==

In fluid dynamics, the first law of thermodynamics reads formula_55.

==Spatially inhomogeneous systems==
Classical thermodynamics is initially focused on closed homogeneous systems (e.g. Planck 1897/1903), which might be regarded as &#x27;zero-dimensional&#x27; in the sense that they have no spatial variation. But it is desired to study also systems with distinct internal motion and spatial inhomogeneity. For such systems, the principle of conservation of energy is expressed in terms not only of internal energy as defined for homogeneous systems, but also in terms of kinetic energy and potential energies of parts of the inhomogeneous system with respect to each other and with respect to long-range external forces. How the total energy of a system is allocated between these three more specific kinds of energy varies according to the purposes of different writers; this is because these components of energy are to some extent mathematical artefacts rather than actually measured physical quantities. For any closed homogeneous component of an inhomogeneous closed system, if formula_56 denotes the total energy of that component system, one may write

:formula_57

where formula_58 and formula_59 denote respectively the total kinetic energy and the total potential energy of the component closed homogeneous system, and formula_1 denotes its internal energy.

Potential energy can be exchanged with the surroundings of the system when the surroundings impose a force field, such as gravitational or electromagnetic, on the system.

A compound system consisting of two interacting closed homogeneous component subsystems has a potential energy of interaction formula_61 between the subsystems. Thus, in an obvious notation, one may write

:formula_62

The quantity formula_61 in general lacks an assignment to either subsystem in a way that is not arbitrary, and this stands in the way of a general non-arbitrary definition of transfer of energy as work. On occasions, authors make their various respective arbitrary assignments.

The distinction between internal and kinetic energy is hard to make in the presence of turbulent motion within the system, as friction gradually dissipates macroscopic kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into molecular random motion of molecules that is classified as internal energy. The rate of dissipation by friction of kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into internal energy, whether in turbulent or in streamlined flow, is an important quantity in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. This is a serious difficulty for attempts to define entropy for time-varying spatially inhomogeneous systems.

==First law of thermodynamics for open systems==
For the first law of thermodynamics, there is no trivial passage of physical conception from the closed system view to an open system view. For closed systems, the concepts of an adiabatic enclosure and of an adiabatic wall are fundamental. Matter and internal energy cannot permeate or penetrate such a wall. For an open system, there is a wall that allows penetration by matter. In general, matter in diffusive motion carries with it some internal energy, and some microscopic potential energy changes accompany the motion. An open system is not adiabatically enclosed.

There are some cases in which a process for an open system can, for particular purposes, be considered as if it were for a closed system. In an open system, by definition hypothetically or potentially, matter can pass between the system and its surroundings. But when, in a particular case, the process of interest involves only hypothetical or potential but no actual passage of matter, the process can be considered as if it were for a closed system.

===Internal energy for an open system===
Since the revised and more rigorous definition of the internal energy of a closed system rests upon the possibility of processes by which adiabatic work takes the system from one state to another, this leaves a problem for the definition of internal energy for an open system, for which adiabatic work is not in general possible. According to Max Born, the transfer of matter and energy across an open connection &quot;cannot be reduced to mechanics&quot;. In contrast to the case of closed systems, for open systems, in the presence of diffusion, there is no unconstrained and unconditional physical distinction between convective transfer of internal energy by bulk flow of matter, the transfer of internal energy without transfer of matter (usually called heat conduction and work transfer), and change of various potential energies. The older traditional way and the conceptually revised (Carathéodory) way agree that there is no physically unique definition of heat and work transfer processes between open systems.

In particular, between two otherwise isolated open systems an adiabatic wall is by definition impossible. This problem is solved by recourse to the principle of conservation of energy. This principle allows a composite isolated system to be derived from two other component non-interacting isolated systems, in such a way that the total energy of the composite isolated system is equal to the sum of the total energies of the two component isolated systems. Two previously isolated systems can be subjected to the thermodynamic operation of placement between them of a wall permeable to matter and energy, followed by a time for establishment of a new thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium in the new single unpartitioned system. The internal energies of the initial two systems and of the final new system, considered respectively as closed systems as above, can be measured. Then the law of conservation of energy requires that
:formula_64

where and denote the changes in internal energy of the system and of its surroundings respectively. This is a statement of the first law of thermodynamics for a transfer between two otherwise isolated open systems, that fits well with the conceptually revised and rigorous statement of the law stated above.

For the thermodynamic operation of adding two systems with internal energies and , to produce a new system with internal energy , one may write ; the reference states for , and should be specified accordingly, maintaining also that the internal energy of a system be proportional to its mass, so that the internal energies are extensive variables.

There is a sense in which this kind of additivity expresses a fundamental postulate that goes beyond the simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author goes so far as to say that it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.

Also of course
:formula_65

where and denote the changes in mole number of a component substance of the system and of its surroundings respectively. This is a statement of the law of conservation of mass.

===Process of transfer of matter between an open system and its surroundings===
A system connected to its surroundings only through contact by a single permeable wall, but otherwise isolated, is an open system. If it is initially in a state of contact equilibrium with a surrounding subsystem, a thermodynamic process of transfer of matter can be made to occur between them if the surrounding subsystem is subjected to some thermodynamic operation, for example, removal of a partition between it and some further surrounding subsystem. The removal of the partition in the surroundings initiates a process of exchange between the system and its contiguous surrounding subsystem.

An example is evaporation. One may consider an open system consisting of a collection of liquid, enclosed except where it is allowed to evaporate into or to receive condensate from its vapor above it, which may be considered as its contiguous surrounding subsystem, and subject to control of its volume and temperature.

A thermodynamic process might be initiated by a thermodynamic operation in the surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, but it will not make sense to try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat and part of it as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called &#x27;latent heat of evaporation&#x27;, but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.

===Open system with multiple contacts===
An open system can be in contact equilibrium with several other systems at once.

This includes cases in which there is contact equilibrium between the system, and several subsystems in its surroundings, including separate connections with subsystems through walls that are permeable to the transfer of matter and internal energy as heat and allowing friction of passage of the transferred matter, but immovable, and separate connections through adiabatic walls with others, and separate connections through diathermic walls impermeable to matter with yet others. Because there are physically separate connections that are permeable to energy but impermeable to matter, between the system and its surroundings, energy transfers between them can occur with definite heat and work characters. Conceptually essential here is that the internal energy transferred with the transfer of matter is measured by a variable that is mathematically independent of the variables that measure heat and work.

With such independence of variables, the total increase of internal energy in the process is then determined as the sum of the internal energy transferred from the surroundings with the transfer of matter through the walls that are permeable to it, and of the internal energy transferred to the system as heat through the diathermic walls, and of the energy transferred to the system as work through the adiabatic walls, including the energy transferred to the system by long-range forces. These simultaneously transferred quantities of energy are defined by events in the surroundings of the system. Because the internal energy transferred with matter is not in general uniquely resolvable into heat and work components, the total energy transfer cannot in general be uniquely resolved into heat and work components. Under these conditions, the following formula can describe the process in terms of externally defined thermodynamic variables, as a statement of the first law of thermodynamics:
where Δ&quot;U&quot;0 denotes the change of internal energy of the system, and denotes the change of internal energy of the of the surrounding subsystems that are in open contact with the system, due to transfer between the system and that surrounding subsystem, and denotes the internal energy transferred as heat from the heat reservoir of the surroundings to the system, and denotes the energy transferred from the system to the surrounding subsystems that are in adiabatic connection with it. The case of a wall that is permeable to matter and can move so as to allow transfer of energy as work is not considered here.

====Combination of first and second laws====
If the system is described by the energetic fundamental equation, &quot;U&quot;0 = &quot;U&quot;0(&quot;S&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;Nj&quot;), and if the process can be described in the quasi-static formalism, in terms of the internal state variables of the system, then the process can also be described by a combination of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, by the formula
where there are &quot;n&quot; chemical constituents of the system and permeably connected surrounding subsystems, and where &quot;T&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;Nj&quot;, and &quot;μj&quot;, are defined as above.

For a general natural process, there is no immediate term-wise correspondence between equations () and (), because they describe the process in different conceptual frames.

Nevertheless, a conditional correspondence exists. There are three relevant kinds of wall here: purely diathermal, adiabatic, and permeable to matter. If two of those kinds of wall are sealed off, leaving only one that permits transfers of energy, as work, as heat, or with matter, then the remaining permitted terms correspond precisely. If two of the kinds of wall are left unsealed, then energy transfer can be shared between them, so that the two remaining permitted terms do not correspond precisely.

For the special fictive case of quasi-static transfers, there is a simple correspondence. For this, it is supposed that the system has multiple areas of contact with its surroundings. There are pistons that allow adiabatic work, purely diathermal walls, and open connections with surrounding subsystems of completely controllable chemical potential (or equivalent controls for charged species). Then, for a suitable fictive quasi-static transfer, one can write

:formula_66
where formula_67 is the added amount of species formula_68 and formula_69 is the corresponding molar entropy.

For fictive quasi-static transfers for which the chemical potentials in the connected surrounding subsystems are suitably controlled, these can be put into equation (4) to yield

where formula_70 is the molar enthalpy of species formula_68.

===Non-equilibrium transfers===
The transfer of energy between an open system and a single contiguous subsystem of its surroundings is considered also in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The problem of definition arises also in this case. It may be allowed that the wall between the system and the subsystem is not only permeable to matter and to internal energy, but also may be movable so as to allow work to be done when the two systems have different pressures. In this case, the transfer of energy as heat is not defined.

The first law of thermodynamics for any process on the specification of equation (3) can be defined as 

where Δ&quot;U&quot; denotes the change of internal energy of the system, denotes the internal energy transferred as heat from the heat reservoir of the surroundings to the system, denotes the work of the system and formula_70 is the molar enthalpy of species formula_68, coming into the system from the surrounding that is in contact with the system. 

Formula (6) is valid in general case, both for quasi-static and for irreversible processes. The situation of the quasi-static process is considered in the previous Section, which in our terms defines 
To describe deviation of the thermodynamic system from equilibrium, in addition to fundamental variables that are used to fix the equilibrium state, as was described above, a set of variables formula_74 that are called &quot;internal variables&quot; have been introduced, which allows to formulate for the general case

Methods for study of non-equilibrium processes mostly deal with spatially continuous flow systems. In this case, the open connection between system and surroundings is usually taken to fully surround the system, so that there are no separate connections impermeable to matter but permeable to heat. Except for the special case mentioned above when there is no actual transfer of matter, which can be treated as if for a closed system, in strictly defined thermodynamic terms, it follows that transfer of energy as heat is not defined. In this sense, there is no such thing as &#x27;heat flow&#x27; for a continuous-flow open system. Properly, for closed systems, one speaks of transfer of internal energy as heat, but in general, for open systems, one can speak safely only of transfer of internal energy. A factor here is that there are often cross-effects between distinct transfers, for example that transfer of one substance may cause transfer of another even when the latter has zero chemical potential gradient.

Usually transfer between a system and its surroundings applies to transfer of a state variable, and obeys a balance law, that the amount lost by the donor system is equal to the amount gained by the receptor system. Heat is not a state variable. For his 1947 definition of &quot;heat transfer&quot; for discrete open systems, the author Prigogine carefully explains at some length that his definition of it does not obey a balance law. He describes this as paradoxical.

The situation is clarified by Gyarmati, who shows that his definition of &quot;heat transfer&quot;, for continuous-flow systems, really refers not specifically to heat, but rather to transfer of internal energy, as follows. He considers a conceptual small cell in a situation of continuous-flow as a system defined in the so-called Lagrangian way, moving with the local center of mass. The flow of matter across the boundary is zero when considered as a flow of total mass. Nevertheless, if the material constitution is of several chemically distinct components that can diffuse with respect to one another, the system is considered to be open, the diffusive flows of the components being defined with respect to the center of mass of the system, and balancing one another as to mass transfer. Still there can be a distinction between bulk flow of internal energy and diffusive flow of internal energy in this case, because the internal energy density does not have to be constant per unit mass of material, and allowing for non-conservation of internal energy because of local conversion of kinetic energy of bulk flow to internal energy by viscosity.

Gyarmati shows that his definition of &quot;the heat flow vector&quot; is strictly speaking a definition of flow of internal energy, not specifically of heat, and so it turns out that his use here of the word heat is contrary to the strict thermodynamic definition of heat, though it is more or less compatible with historical custom, that often enough did not clearly distinguish between heat and internal energy; he writes &quot;that this relation must be considered to be the exact definition of the concept of heat flow, fairly loosely used in experimental physics and heat technics&quot;. Apparently in a different frame of thinking from that of the above-mentioned paradoxical usage in the earlier sections of the historic 1947 work by Prigogine, about discrete systems, this usage of Gyarmati is consistent with the later sections of the same 1947 work by Prigogine, about continuous-flow systems, which use the term &quot;heat flux&quot; in just this way. This usage is also followed by Glansdorff and Prigogine in their 1971 text about continuous-flow systems. They write: &quot;Again the flow of internal energy may be split into a convection flow and a conduction flow. This conduction flow is by definition the heat flow . Therefore: where denotes the [internal] energy per unit mass. [These authors actually use the symbols and to denote internal energy but their notation has been changed here to accord with the notation of the present article. These authors actually use the symbol to refer to total energy, including kinetic energy of bulk flow.]&quot; This usage is followed also by other writers on non-equilibrium thermodynamics such as Lebon, Jou, and Casas-Vásquez, and de Groot and Mazur. This usage is described by Bailyn as stating the non-convective flow of internal energy, and is listed as his definition number 1, according to the first law of thermodynamics. This usage is also followed by workers in the kinetic theory of gases. This is not the &quot;ad hoc&quot; definition of &quot;reduced heat flux&quot; of Rolf Haase.

In the case of a flowing system of only one chemical constituent, in the Lagrangian representation, there is no distinction between bulk flow and diffusion of matter. Moreover, the flow of matter is zero into or out of the cell that moves with the local center of mass. In effect, in this description, one is dealing with a system effectively closed to the transfer of matter. But still one can validly talk of a distinction between bulk flow and diffusive flow of internal energy, the latter driven by a temperature gradient within the flowing material, and being defined with respect to the local center of mass of the bulk flow. In this case of a virtually closed system, because of the zero matter transfer, as noted above, one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work, and transfer of internal energy as heat.

<text>Husband Edward Kimmel (February 26, 1882 – May 14, 1968) was a United States Navy four-star admiral who was the commander in chief of the United States Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT) during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He was removed from that command after the attack, in December 1941, and was reverted to his permanent two-star rank of rear admiral due to no longer holding a four-star assignment. He retired from the Navy in early 1942. The United States Senate voted to restore Kimmel&#x27;s permanent rank to four stars in 1999, but President Clinton did not act on the resolution, and neither have any of his successors.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Husband Kimmel was born in Henderson, Kentucky, on February 26, 1882, to Sibella &quot;Sibbie&quot; Lambert Kimmel (1846–1919) and Major Manning Marius Kimmel (1832–1916), a graduate of West Point who fought with the Union side during the American Civil War before switching allegiance to the Confederate States Army to fight alongside his neighbors. Kimmel was a descendant of Herman Husband.

Kimmel was known by various nicknames throughout his life: &quot;Kim&quot; and &quot;Hubbie&quot;, contractions of his given and family names, and later, &quot;Mustafa&quot;, the last being a reference to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, due to the similar sounding (homophony) &quot;Kimmel&quot; and &quot;Kemal&quot;.

He married Dorothy Kinkaid (1890–1975), sister of Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, with whom he had three sons: Manning, Thomas K. Kimmel and Edward R. Kimmel.

===Naval career===

Kimmel graduated in 1904 from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. One of his classmates was future fleet admiral Willam Halsey. From 1906 to 1907 he served on several battleships in the Caribbean. In 1907 he was assigned to the during its participation in the around-the-world cruise of the Great White Fleet. Kimmel then served in the United States occupation of Veracruz, Mexico, during which he was wounded in April 1914.

In 1915 he was briefly appointed as an aide to Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. During World War I, Kimmel served as a squadron gunnery officer in U.S. Battleship Division Nine which served as the Sixth Battle Squadron of the British Grand Fleet. After the war he served as Executive Officer aboard the battleship , then in Washington, D.C., and the Philippines, as well as commanding two destroyer divisions before attaining the rank of captain in 1926 upon completion of the senior course at the Naval War College.

From 1926 to 1937 Kimmel held a number of positions in the Navy Department, as well as the command of a destroyer squadron and of the battleship .

In 1937 he was promoted to the flag rank of rear admiral. In this capacity he commanded Cruiser Division Seven on a diplomatic cruise to South America and in 1939 became Commander of Battle Force Cruisers.

===Pearl Harbor===

After Admiral James O. Richardson was relieved of command in February 1941, in part for protesting that the Pacific Fleet if based in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, would be the logical first target in the event of war with Japan, Kimmel was appointed in his place as Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (CINCUS). Kimmel was also appointed Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT), a position reestablished on February 1, 1941, when General Order 143 was issued, and Kimmel assumed command with the temporary rank of admiral starting on that date. Kimmel earned a reputation as a hard worker who inspired subordinates, but some later criticized him for over-attention to detail, claiming it portrayed a lack of self-confidence. These critics asserted that Kimmel constantly revisited minute tasks he had done previously when he could have delegated the work to others.

On the other hand, Kimmel&#x27;s fleet gunnery officer Willard Kitts later testified that under Kimmel&#x27;s leadership, &quot;the efficiency and training of the Fleet was at its highest level.&quot; William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey, who in 1941 commanded one of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s carrier task forces and rose during the war to five-star fleet admiral, described Kimmel as &quot;the ideal man for the job.&quot;

The base for the fleet had been moved from its traditional home at San Diego, California, to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in May 1940. Richardson had been relieved of command for his vocal opposition to this move and concerns about the fleet&#x27;s vulnerability. On February 18, 1941, Kimmel wrote to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral Harold Raynsford Stark:
I feel that a surprise attack (submarine, air, or combined) on Pearl Harbor is a possibility, and we are taking immediate practical steps to minimize the damage inflicted and to ensure that the attacking force will pay.

On April 18, 1941, Kimmel wrote to the CNO requesting additional resources for base construction at Wake Island and for a Marine Corps defense battalion to be stationed there. On August 19 the first permanent Marine garrison was assigned. Naval Air Station Midway was commissioned in August after the completion of runways and support structures, and a Marine garrison assigned shortly afterwards. In November Kimmel ordered to ferry Marine fighters and pilots to Wake Island to reinforce the garrison, and for to depart Pearl Harbor on December 5 to ferry Marine dive bombers to Midway. Because of these missions, neither aircraft carrier was in Pearl Harbor during the later Japanese attack.

Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor occurred in an air raid on December 7, 1941, and caused the deaths of 2,403 U.S. military personnel and civilians. Edwin T. Layton related that during the attack:

Kimmel stood by the window of his office at the submarine base, his jaw set in stony anguish. As he watched the disaster across the harbor unfold with terrible fury, a spent .50 caliber machine gun bullet crashed through the glass. It brushed the admiral before it clanged to the floor. It cut his white jacket and raised a welt on his chest. &quot;It would have been merciful had it killed me,&quot; Kimmel murmured to his communications officer, Commander Maurice &quot;Germany&quot; Curts.

In &quot;The World at War&quot;, a naval serviceman—who had been alongside Admiral Kimmel during the attack—recalled that as Kimmel watched the destruction of the fleet, he tore off his four-star shoulder boards in apparent recognition of the impending end of his command.

===After Pearl Harbor===
Kimmel was relieved of his command ten days after the attack. At the time he was planning and executing retaliatory moves, including an effort to relieve and reinforce Wake Island that could have led to an early clash between American and Japanese carrier forces. Vice Admiral William S. Pye (Commander, Battle Force, Pacific Fleet) became acting CINCPACFLT on December 17. He had reservations about Kimmel&#x27;s plan and decided the Wake Island operation was too risky, recalling the relief force. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz took over as CINCPACFLT on December 31 and by that time Wake Island had been invaded and occupied by the Japanese. Kimmel&#x27;s CINCUS command was reassigned to Admiral Ernest J. King (at that time Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet [CINCLANTFLT]) in a wartime expanded role of Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (with the new acronym of COMINCH), which would also be combined with King&#x27;s subsequent appointment as the Chief of Naval Operations.

In 1942, the Roberts Commission, appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to investigate the attack, determined that Kimmel and his counterpart, Army Lieutenant General Walter Short, were guilty of errors of judgment and dereliction of duty in the events leading up to the attack. Kimmel defended his decisions at several hearings, testifying that important information had not been made available to him.

Following the death of Secretary Knox in April 1944, his successor James V. Forrestal ordered that a Naval Court of Inquiry be convened to investigate the facts surrounding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and to assess any culpability borne by members of the Navy. The court consisted of Admiral Adolphus Andrews; Admiral Orin G. Murfin, who served as President of the Court, and Admiral Edward C. Kalbfus. The court convened on July 24, 1944, and held daily sessions in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Pearl Harbor. After interviewing numerous witnesses, it completed its work on October 19, 1944. Its report to the Navy Department largely exonerated Kimmel. The court found that Kimmel&#x27;s decisions had been correct given the limited information available to him, but criticized then-Chief of Naval Operations Harold R. Stark for failing to warn Kimmel that war was imminent. The court concluded that &quot;based upon the facts established, the Court is of the opinion that no offenses have been committed nor serious blame incurred on the part of any person or persons in the naval service.&quot; Because the court&#x27;s findings implicitly revealed that American cryptographers had broken the Japanese codes, a critical wartime secret, the court&#x27;s report was not made public until after the end of the war.

Upon reviewing the report, Forrestal felt that the court had been too lenient in assigning blame for the disaster. The court had found that the Army and Navy had adequately cooperated in the defense of Pearl Harbor; that there had been no information indicating that Japanese carriers were on their way to attack Pearl Harbor; and that the attack had succeeded principally because of the aerial torpedo, a secret weapon whose use could not have been predicted. Forrestal disapproved of all of these findings, judging that Kimmel could have done more with the information he had had to prevent or mitigate the attack. Forrestal concluded that both Kimmel and Stark had &quot;failed to demonstrate the superior judgment necessary for exercising command commensurate with their rank and their assigned duties.&quot;

Kimmel retired in early 1942, and worked for the military contractor Frederic R. Harris, Inc. after the war. In retirement, Kimmel lived in Groton, Connecticut, where he died on May 14, 1968.

His son, Manning, died after the submarine he commanded, the , was sunk near Palawan on or around July 26, 1944. The Kimmel family at the time was informed that Manning had gone down with his ship. Though it was widely believed that Manning Kimmel died on board his boat, several sources (including Admiral Ralph Waldo Christie, commander of submarine operations at Fremantle at the time) stated after the war that Manning was one of a handful of survivors from his submarine, having been swept overboard as the boat sank after hitting a mine. According to these sources, Manning was captured by Japanese forces, and along with several other survivors from the USS &quot;Robalo&quot; was pushed into a ditch, doused with gasoline and burned alive by his captors, who were enraged over a recent American air attack.

==Posthumous reputation and debate==
Historians agree that the United States was unprepared for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor at all levels, though this has been challenged by comments from MI6 spy Colonel Charles Howard &#x27;Dick&#x27; Ellis, posthumously quoted in Jesse Fink&#x27;s 2023 biography of Ellis, &quot;The Eagle in the Mirror&quot;.

Ellis was deputy to William Stephenson at British Security Co-ordination in New York. 

Fink quotes Ellis: ‘[Stephenson] was convinced from the information that was reaching him that this attack was imminent, and through Jimmy Roosevelt, President Roosevelt’s son, he passed this information to the President. Now whether the President at that time had other information which corroborated this... it’s impossible to say.’

Japanese military forces enjoyed clear superiority in training, equipment, experience and planning over the Americans. The extent to which Kimmel himself bore responsibility for the unreadiness of his Pacific Fleet has been a matter of debate.

Some, such as submarine Captain Edward L. &quot;Ned&quot; Beach, concluded that Admiral Kimmel and General Short, who was also dismissed from command, were made scapegoats for the failures of superiors in Washington. Kimmel&#x27;s supporters point to a series of bureaucratic foulups and circumstances beyond anyone&#x27;s control that led to the fleet&#x27;s lack of preparedness, including poor atmospheric conditions that blocked a radio warning from the War Department to Pearl Harbor of a possible attack, forcing it to be sent as a telegram, which delayed it long enough for the attack to start before Kimmel received it (the telegram messenger was on his way to deliver the message when the attack commenced; he was forced to take cover in a ditch. Kimmel did not get the warning until after the attack ended).

Edwin T. Layton, chief intelligence officer for Kimmel and one of the officers who knew Kimmel best, provided support for Kimmel&#x27;s position. Layton argued Kimmel had not been provided complete information and that Kimmel deployed the few reconnaissance resources at his disposal in the most logical way, given the available information.

On the other hand, Kimmel&#x27;s critics point out that he had been ordered 10 days prior to the attack to initiate a &quot;defensive deployment&quot; of the fleet. Kimmel, thinking the main threat to the fleet was sabotage, kept much of the fleet in port and did not place the fleet on alert. When his intelligence unit lost track of Japan&#x27;s aircraft carriers, he did not order long-range air or naval patrols to assess their positions. He had a poor working arrangement with his Army counterpart, General Short, who was charged with defending the fleet while in port.

Historians generally recognize that American forces would have fared poorly even if Kimmel had reacted differently. In a 1964 interview, Admiral Chester Nimitz, who took over as commander of the Pacific Fleet three weeks after the attack, concluded that, &quot;It was God&#x27;s mercy that our fleet was in Pearl Harbor on December 7.&quot; If Kimmel &quot;[had] had advance notice that the Japanese were coming, he most probably would have tried to intercept them. With the difference in speed between Kimmel&#x27;s battleships and the faster Japanese carriers, the former could not have come within rifle range of the enemy&#x27;s flattops. As a result, we would have lost many ships in deep water and also thousands more in lives.&quot; Instead, at Pearl Harbor, the crews were easily rescued, and six of eight front-line battleships ultimately raised. This was also the assessment of Joseph Rochefort, head of the US Navy&#x27;s Station HYPO, who remarked the attack was cheap at the price.

In 1994 Kimmel&#x27;s family, including his grandson, South Carolina broadcaster Manning Kimmel IV, attempted for the third time to have Kimmel&#x27;s four-star rank reinstated. President Bill Clinton denied the request, as had Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. A 1995 Pentagon study concluded other high-ranking officers were also responsible for the failure at Pearl Harbor, but did not exonerate Kimmel.

On May 25, 1999, the United States Senate, by a vote of 52–47, passed a non-binding resolution to exonerate Kimmel and Short and requested that the President of the United States posthumously restore both men to full rank. Senator Strom Thurmond, one of the sponsors of the resolution, called Kimmel and Short &quot;the two final victims of Pearl Harbor.&quot; The Senate enquiry in 2000 issued a lengthy exoneration of Kimmel&#x27;s conduct. President Clinton did not act on the resolution, nor have any of his successors.

<text>Henan is a province in Central China. Henan is home to many heritage sites, including Yinxu, the ruins of the final capital of the Shang dynasty () and the Shaolin Temple. Four of the historical capitals of China, Luoyang, Anyang, Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, are in Henan.

While the province&#x27;s name means &#x27;south of the river&#x27;, approximately a quarter of the province lies north of the Yellow River. With an area of , Henan covers a large part of the fertile and densely populated North China Plain. Its neighboring provinces are Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, and Hubei.

Henan is China&#x27;s third-most populous province and the most populous among inland provinces, with a population of over 99 million as of 2020. It is also the world&#x27;s seventh-most populous administrative division; if it were a country by itself, Henan would be the 17th-most populous in the world, behind Egypt and Vietnam. People from Henan often suffer from regional discrimination.

Henan is the 5th-largest provincial economy of China, the second-largest in South Central China after Guangdong, and the largest among inland provinces, with a nominal GDP of (US$926 billion) as of 2021, ahead of the nation of Turkey ($815 billion). If it were a country, it would be the 18th-largest economy as of 2021. However, its GDP per capita is low compared to other eastern and central provinces. The economy continues to grow based on aluminum and coal prices, as well as agriculture, heavy industry, tourism and retail. High-tech industries and the service sector are concentrated around Zhengzhou and Luoyang.

Henan hosts more than 150 institutions of higher education, ranking first in the Central China region. As of 2023, three major cities in the province ranked in the top 200 cities in the world (Zhengzhou 76th, Kaifeng 154th and Xinxiang 195th) by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index.

==History==
Widely regarded as one of the cradles of Chinese civilization along with the provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi, Henan is known for its historical prosperity and periodic downturns. The economic prosperity resulted from its extensive fertile plains and its location at the heart of the country. However, its strategic location also means that it has suffered from nearly all of the major wars in China. In addition, the numerous floods of the Yellow River have caused significant damage from time to time. Kaifeng, in particular, has been buried by China&#x27;s Yellow River&#x27;s silt seven times due to flooding.

===Antiquity===
Archaeological sites reveal that prehistoric cultures such as the Yangshao Culture and Longshan Culture were active in what is now northern Henan since the Neolithic Era. The more recent Erlitou culture has been controversially identified with the Xia dynasty, the first and largely legendary Chinese dynasty that was established, roughly, in the 21st century BC. Virtually the entire kingdom existed within what is now north and central Henan.

The Xia dynasty collapsed around the 16th century BC following the invasion of Shang, a neighboring vassal state centered around today&#x27;s Shangqiu in eastern Henan. The Shang dynasty (16th–11th centuries BC) was the first literate dynasty of China. Its many capitals are located at the modern cities of Shangqiu, Yanshi, and Zhengzhou. Their last and most important capital of Yin, located in modern Anyang, is where the first Chinese writing was created.
In the 11th century BC, the Zhou dynasty of Shaanxi arrived from the west and overthrew the Shang dynasty. During the Western Zhou period (c. 1046 – 771 BC), the capital and political and economical center was moved away from Henan for the first time. The Spring and Autumn period, a period of warfare and rivalry, began in 721 BC. What is now Henan and all of China was divided into a variety of small, independent states, constantly at war for control of the central plain. Although regarded formally as the ruler of China, the control that Zhou king in Luoyang exerted over the feudal kingdoms had virtually disappeared. Despite the prolonged period of instability, prominent philosophers such as Confucius emerged in this era and offered their ideas on how a state should be run. Laozi, the founder of Taoism, was born in northern Chu, part of modern-day Henan.

Later on, these states were replaced by seven large and powerful states during the Warring States period, and Henan was divided into three states, the Wei to the north, the Chu to the south, and the Han in the middle. In 221 BC, state of Qin forces from Shaanxi conquered all of the other six states, ending 800 years of warfare.

===Imperial era===
Ying Zheng, the leader of Qin, crowned himself (220 BCE) as the first emperor of China. He abolished the feudal system and centralized all powers, establishing the Qin dynasty and unifying the core of the Han Chinese homeland for the first time. The empire quickly collapsed after the death (210 BCE) of Ying Zheng and was replaced by the Han dynasty in 206 BC, with its capital at Chang&#x27;an. Thus, a golden age of Chinese culture, economy, and military power began. The capital moved east to Luoyang in 25 AD, in response to a coup in Chang&#x27;an that created the short-lived Xin dynasty. Luoyang quickly regained control of China, and the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220) began, extending the golden age for another two centuries.

The late Eastern Han dynasty saw war and rivalry between regional warlords. Xuchang in central Henan was the power base of Cao Cao, who eventually succeeded in unifying all of northern China under the Kingdom of Wei. Wei then moved its capital to Luoyang, which remained the capital after the unification of China by the Western Jin dynasty. During this period Luoyang became one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the world, despite being repeatedly damaged by warfare.
With the fall of the Western Jin dynasty in the 4th and 5th centuries, nomadic peoples from the north invaded northern China and established many successive regimes in northern China, including Henan. These people were gradually assimilated into the Chinese culture in a process known as sinification.

The short-lived Sui dynasty reunified China again in 589 with its capital back in Chang&#x27;an. It collapsed due to Sui Emperor Yang&#x27;s costly attempt to relocate the capital from Chang&#x27;an to Luoyang and the construction of many extravagant palaces there. The succeeding Tang dynasty (618–907) kept its capital in Chang&#x27;an, marking the beginning of China&#x27;s second golden age, with Henan being one of the wealthiest places in the empire.

The Tang dynasty lasted for three centuries before it eventually succumbed to internal strife. In the Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907–960) that followed, Kaifeng in eastern Henan became the capital of four dynasties. The Song dynasty that reunified China in 982 also had its capital at Kaifeng. Under Song rule, China entered another era of culture and prosperity, and Kaifeng overtook Luoyang and Chang&#x27;an as the largest city in China and in the world. In 1127, however, the Song dynasty succumbed to Jurchen (Jin dynasty) invaders from the north in the Jin–Song war, and in 1142 ceded all of northern China, including Henan. The Song government moved its capital to Hangzhou in Southern China, which, under the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) continued to enjoy relative economic and culture prosperity. A prolonged period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity in the Yangtze delta &quot;Jiangnan&quot; region (modern southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, and Shanghai) made this the new center of Chinese culture and economy.

Kaifeng served as the Jurchen&#x27;s &quot;southern capital&quot; from 1157 (other sources say 1161) and was reconstructed during this time. But the Jurchen kept their main capital further north, until 1214, when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to Kaifeng in order to flee the Mongol onslaught. In 1234 they succumbed to combined Mongol and Song dynasty forces. Mongols took control, and in 1279 they conquered all of China, establishing the Yuan dynasty and set up the equivalent of modern Henan, with borders very similar to the modern ones. Neither its territories nor its role in the economy changed under later dynasties. Henan remained important in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and Qing dynasty (1644–1911) that followed, though its economy slowly deteriorated due to frequent natural disasters.

===Modern era===
The Qing dynasty was overthrown by the 1911 Revolution and then the Republic of China was established in 1912, during which a man from Henan, Yuan Shikai, played an important role and thus he became the first president of Republic of China. The construction and extension of the Pinghan Railway and Longhai Railway had turned Zhengzhou, a minor county town at the time, into a major transportation hub. Despite the rise of Zhengzhou, Henan&#x27;s overall economy repeatedly stumbled as it was the hardest hit by the many disasters that struck China in its modern era.

Henan suffered greatly during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1938, when the Imperial Japanese Army captured Kaifeng, the government led by Chiang Kai-shek bombed the Huayuankou dam in Zhengzhou in order to prevent Japanese forces from advancing further. However, this caused massive flooding in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. In 1942 Henan was hit by a great famine resulting from a mix of drought, locusts and destruction caused by the war.

In 1954, the new government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China moved the capital of Henan from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou, as a result of its economic importance. The PRC had earlier established a short-lived Pingyuan Province consisting of what is now northern Henan and western Shandong with Xinxiang as its capital. This province was abolished in 1952.

In 1958, Yashan in Suiping County, Henan, became the first people&#x27;s commune of China, heralding the beginning of the &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot;. In the subsequent famines of the early 1960s popularly attributed to the Great Leap Forward, Henan was one of the hardest hit and millions of people died. Suffering under famine and economic chaos caused by the Great Leap, locals in Henan offered low-level resistance mostly through banditry. In 1959, however, a full peasant uprising erupted and was only defeated after twenty days of fighting.

A destructive flooding of the Huai River in the summer of 1950 prompted large-scale construction of dams on its tributaries in central and southern Henan.
Unfortunately, many of the dams were not able to withstand the extraordinarily high levels of rainfall caused by Typhoon Nina in August 1975. Sixty-two dams, the largest of which was the Banqiao Dam in Biyang County collapsed; catastrophic flooding, spread over several counties throughout Zhumadian Prefecture and further downstream, killed at least 26,000 people. Unofficial human life loss estimates, including deaths from the ensuing epidemics and famine, range as high as 85,600, 171,000 or even 230 000. This is considered the most deadly dam-related disaster in human history.

By the early 1970s, China was one of the poorest countries in the world, and Henan was one of the poorest provinces in China. In 1978, however, when the communist leader Deng Xiaoping initiated the open door policy and embraced capitalism, China entered an economic boom that continues today. The boom did not reach inland provinces such as Henan initially, but by the 1990s Henan&#x27;s economy was expanding at an even faster rate than that of China overall.

In July 2021, high amounts of rainfall caused flooding, killing 302 and damaging amounting to 82 billion yuan.

==Geography==

Henan has a diverse landscape with floodplains in the east and mountains in the west. Much of the province forms part the densely populated North China Plain, an area known as the &quot;breadbasket of China&quot;. The Taihang Mountains intrude partially into Henan&#x27;s northwestern borders from Shanxi, forming the eastern edge of Loess Plateau. To the west the Xionger and Funiu Mountains form an extensive network of mountain ranges and plateaus, supporting one of the few remaining temperate deciduous forests which once covered all of Henan. The renowned Mount Song and its Shaolin Temple is located in the far east of the region, near the capital city Zhengzhou. To the far south, the Dabie Mountains divides Hubei from Henan. The Nanyang Basin, separated from North China Plain by these mountains, is another important agricultural and population center, with culture and history distinct from the rest of Henan and closer to that of Hubei&#x27;s. Unlike the rest of northern China, desertification is not a problem in Henan, though sandstorms are common in cities near the Yellow River due to the large amount of sand present in the river. At 2413.8 meters above sea level, the highest point in Henan province is Laoyachanao ().

The Yellow River passes through central Henan. It enters from the northwest, via the Sanmenxia Reservoir. After it passes Luoyang, the mountains gave way to plains. Excessive amount of sediments are formed due to the silt it picks up from the Loess Plateau, raising the river bed and causing frequent floods which shaped the habitat of the region. More recently however, construction of dams and levees, as well as the depletion of water resources have ended the floods. The Huai River in southern Henan is another important river, and has been recognized as part of the boundary dividing northern and southern Chinese climate and culture.

Henan shares borders with six other provinces. It is bordered to the west by Shaanxi, to the south by Hubei, and to the north by Shanxi (northwest) and Hebei (northeast). To the east lie Shandong (northeast) and Anhui (southeast), whose borders meet at a narrow strip of land which separates Henan from Jiangsu to the east.

===Climate===
Henan has a temperate climate that is humid subtropical (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot; or &quot;Cfa&quot;) to the south of the Yellow River and bordering on humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;) to the north. It has a distinct seasonal climate characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cool to cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Temperatures average around the freezing mark in January and 27 to 28 °C in July. A great majority of the annual rainfall occurs during the summer.

==Administrative divisions==

Henan is divided into seventeen prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities; along with one directly administered county-level city (a sub-prefecture-level city):

These 17 prefecture-level cities and one directly administered county-level city of Henan are in turn subdivided into 157 county-level divisions (54 districts, 21 county-level cities, and 82 counties; the sub-prefecture-level city of Jiyuan is counted as a county-level city here). Those are in turn divided into 2454 township-level divisions (1181 towns, 598 townships, twelve ethnic townships, and 663 subdistricts).

===Urban areas===


== Demographics ==
With a population of approximately 93.6 million, Henan is the third most populous Chinese province after Guangdong and Shandong. It is also the fifth most populous sub-national division in the world. If it were a country by itself, it would be the twelfth most populous in the world, just behind Mexico and ahead of the Philippines. However, the hukou system shows Henan as the most populous province in China with over 103 million people, as it counts the migrant Henanese laborers as residents of Henan, instead of the province they currently reside in. On the other hand, Guangdong is shown as having only 81 million people, though the actual population is 95 million due to the influx of migrants from other provinces.

The population is highly homogeneous with 98.8% of the population being Han. Small populations of Mongols and Manchus exists in scattered rural communities as well as major urban centers.
Along with Jiangxi, Henan has one of the most unbalanced gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government&#x27;s one-child policy (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government. Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1–4 age group; this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines.

===Religion===

According to a 2012 survey only around 13% of the population of Henan belongs to organised religions, the largest groups being Buddhists with 6.4%, followed by Protestants with 5.6%, Muslims with 1.3% and Catholics with 0.5%. Henan has some important centres of Chinese Buddhism, the White Horse Temple and the famous Shaolin Monastery.

Henan has also the largest Christian population by numbers and percentage of any province of China, 6.1% of the province&#x27;s population , corresponding to approximately 7 million Christians. A 2009 survey reported the share of Christians to be 9.33%. In 2019, Communist officials demolished the True Jesus Church near Zhumadian. In 2020, Communist officials demolished the Sunzhuang Church.

The reports didn&#x27;t give figures for other types of religion; 86% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Confucianism, Taoism and folk religious sects (for example, a sect that is endogenous to Henan is the Tianxian miaodao). According to a 2007 survey, approximately 8% of the Henanese believe in and are involved in ancestor veneration, the traditional Chinese religion of the lineages organised into lineage churches and ancestral shrines.

==Politics==

The Government of Henan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The Governor of Henan is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Henan. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Henan Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the &quot;Henan CCP Party Chief&quot;.

==Economy==

Henan has seen rapid development in its economy over the past two decades, and its economy has expanded at an even faster rate than the national average of 10%. This rapid growth has transformed Henan from one of the poorest provinces to one that matches other central provinces.

Henan is the 5th-largest provincial economy of China, the second largest in South Central China after Guangdong, the largest in Central China and the largest among inland provinces, with a nominal GDP of 5.88 trillion RMB (US$926 billion) as of 2021, ahead of the GDP of Turkey of 815 billion. If it were a country, it would be the 18th-largest economy as well as the 17th most populous as of 2021. However, per capita GDP is low compared to other eastern and central provinces.

Henan is a semi-industrialized economy with an underdeveloped service sector. Agriculture has traditionally been a pillar of its economy, with the nation&#x27;s highest wheat and sesame output and second highest rice output, earning its reputation as the breadbasket of China. Henan is also an important producer of beef, cotton, maize, pork, animal oil, and corn.

Although Henan&#x27;s industry has traditionally been based on light textiles and food processing, recent developments have diversified the industry sector to metallurgy, petrol, cement, chemical industry, machinery and electronics.

Mining-related industries are a major part of Henan&#x27;s economy. Henan has the second largest molybdenum reserves in the world. Coal, aluminum, alkaline metals and tungsten are also present in large amounts in western Henan. Henan houses some of the biggest limestone reserves in China estimated over 24 billion tons. Export and processing of these materials is one of the main sources of revenues.

Henan has planned its economy around the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, and it is hoped that the province may become an important transportation and manufacturing hub in the years to come.

In July 2021, extreme flooding inflicted an estimated US$12.7 billion of economic damage in Henan.

==Transportation==

Henan has some of the most advanced transportation system in China due to its flat terrain and its location at the heart of central China&#x27;s construction boom. The Jingguang and Longhai Railway, the nation&#x27;s two most important railways, run through much of the province and intersect at Zhengzhou. Other railway hubs such as Shangqiu, Xinxiang, and Luohe have also become important centers of trade and manufacturing as a result. Zhengzhou is also an important hub of China&#x27;s high-speed railway network with railway lines connecting the city from 8 directions with all preferecture-level cities in Henan and other important cities in the country. Zhengzhou East Railway Station is one of the largest high speed railway stations in China and the world. Henan&#x27;s expressway system is highly developed and the total length is approximately , the highest total for any Chinese province. The state of air transport is less stellar, the only 3 public airports are located in Xinzheng (near Zhengzhou), Luoyang, and Nanyang.

==Culture==

* Most of Henan speaks dialects of the Mandarin group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China. Linguists put these dialects into the category of &quot;Zhongyuan Mandarin&quot;. The northwestern corner of Henan is an exception, where people speak Jin dialects instead. The dialects of Henan are collectively called &quot;the Henan dialect&quot; in popular usage, with easily identifiable stereotypical features.
*Yu opera is the local form of Chinese opera; it is also well-known and popular across the rest of China. Henan Quju and Henan Yuediao are also important local opera forms.

<doc id="166409" wikidata="Q45761" url="?curid=166409" title="Hunan">
<text>Hunan is an inland province in Central China. Located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze watershed, it borders the province-level divisions of Hubei to the north, Jiangxi to the east, Guangdong and Guangxi to the south, and Guizhou and Chongqing to the northwest. Its capital and largest city is Changsha, which abuts the Xiang River. Hengyang, Zhuzhou, and Yueyang are among its most populous urban cities.

With a population of just over 66 million residing in an area of approximately , it is China&#x27;s 7th-most populous province, the third-most populous among landlocked provinces (after Henan and Sichuan), the third-most populous in South Central China (after Guangdong and Henan), and the second-most populous province in Central China. It is the largest province in South Central China and the fourth largest among landlocked provinces.

Hunan&#x27;s nominal GDP was US$724 billion (CN¥4.6 trillion) as of 2021, appearing in the world&#x27;s top 20 largest sub-national economies, with its GDP (PPP) being over US$1.1 trillion. Hunan is the 9th-largest provincial economy in China, the fourth-largest in South Central China, the third-largest in Central China, and the fourth-largest among landlocked provinces. Its nominal GDP per capita exceeded US$10,900 (CN¥69,300), making it the third-richest province in South Central China, after Guangdong and Hubei. As of 2020, Hunan&#x27;s nominal GDP reached $605 billion (CN¥4.18 trillion), exceeding that of Poland, with a GDP of US$596 billion, and Thailand, with a GDP of US$501 billion, the 22nd- and 25th-largest in the world, respectively.

The name &quot;Hunan&quot; literally means &quot;south of the lake&quot;. The lake that is referred to is Dongting Lake, a lake in the northeast of the province. Vehicle license plates from Hunan are marked (), after the Xiang River, which runs from south to north through Hunan and forms part of the largest drainage system for the province. The area of Hunan was under Chinese rule as far back as 350 BC. Hunan was the birthplace of communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, who became the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and the founding father of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Hunan today is home to some ethnic minorities, including the Tujia and Miao, along with the Han Chinese, who make up a majority of the population. Varieties of Chinese spoken include Xiang, Gan, and Southwestern Mandarin.

Wulingyuan was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. Changsha, the capital, is located in the eastern part of the province; it is now an important commercial, manufacturing, and transportation center. The busiest airports serve domestic and international flights for Hunan, including Changsha Huanghua International Airport, Zhangjiajie Hehua International Airport, and Changde Taohuayuan Airport. Hunan is the seat of the Yuelu Academy (later become Hunan University), which is one of the four major academies over the last 1000 years in ancient China. As of 2023, Hunan hosts 137 institutions of higher education, ranking fifth among all Chinese provinces. As of 2024, two major cities in Hunan (Changsha 23rd and Xiangtan 199th) ranked in the world&#x27;s top 200 cities by scientific research outputs.

== History ==
Hunan&#x27;s primeval forests were first occupied by the ancestors of the modern Miao, Tujia, Dong and Yao peoples. The province entered written Chinese history around 350 BC, when the province became part of the Zhou dynasty. After Qin conquered the Chu in 278 BC, the region came under the control of Qin, and then the Changsha Kingdom during the Han dynasty. At this time, and for hundreds of years thereafter, the province was a magnet for settlement of Han Chinese from the north, who displaced and assimilated the original indigenous inhabitants, cleared forests and began farming rice in the valleys and plains. The agricultural colonization of the lowlands was carried out in part by the Han people, which managed river dikes to protect farmland from floods. To this day, many of the small villages in Hunan are named after the Han families who settled there. Migration from the north was especially prevalent during the Eastern Jin dynasty, Sixteen Kingdoms and the Northern and Southern dynasties periods, when the north was mostly ruled by non-Han ethnic groups (Five Barbarians) and in perpetual disorder.

During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, Hunan was home to its own independent regime, Ma Chu.

Hunan and Hubei became a part of the province of Huguang until the Qing dynasty. Hunan province was created in 1664 from Huguang, renamed to its current name in 1723.

Hunan became an important communications center due to its position on the Yangzi River. It was an important centre of scholarly activity and Confucian thought, particularly in the Yuelu Academy in Changsha. It was also on the Imperial Highway constructed between northern and southern China. The land produced grain so abundantly that it fed many parts of China with its surpluses. The population continued to climb until, by the nineteenth century, Hunan became overcrowded and prone to peasant uprisings. Some of the uprisings, such as the ten-year Miao Rebellion of 1795–1806, were caused by ethnic tensions. The Taiping Rebellion began in the south in Guangxi Province in 1850. The rebellion spread into Hunan and then further eastward along the Yangzi River valley. Ultimately, it was a Hunanese army (Xiang Army) under Zeng Guofan who marched into Nanjing to put down the uprising in 1864. 

In 1920, a famine raged throughout Hunan and killed an estimated 2 million Hunanese civilians. This sparked the Autumn Harvest Uprising of 1927. It was led by Hunanese native Mao Zedong, and established a short-lived Hunan Soviet in 1927. The Communists maintained a guerrilla army in the mountains along the Hunan-Jiangxi border until 1934. Under pressure from the Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) forces, they began the Long March to bases in Shaanxi Province. After the departure of the Communists, the KMT army fought against the Japanese in the second Sino-Japanese war. They defended Changsha until it fell in 1944. Japan launched Operation Ichigo, a plan to control the railroad from Wuchang to Guangzhou (Yuehan Railway). Hunan was relatively unscathed by the civil war that followed the defeat of the Japanese in 1945. In 1949, the Communists returned once more as the Nationalists retreated southward.

In the 1950s, General Wang Zhen coerced thousands of Hunanese women into sexual servitude at PLA units in Xinjiang.

As Mao Zedong&#x27;s home province, Hunan supported the Cultural Revolution of 1966–1976. However, it was slower than most provinces in adopting the reforms implemented by Deng Xiaoping in the years that followed Mao&#x27;s death in 1976.

In addition to CCP Chairman Mao Zedong, a number of other first-generation communist leaders were also from Hunan: Chinese President Liu Shaoqi; CCP Secretaries-General Ren Bishi and Hu Yaobang; Marshals Peng Dehuai, He Long, and Luo Ronghuan; Wang Zhen, one of the Eight Elders; Xiang Jingyu, the first female member of the CCP&#x27;s central committee; Senior General Huang Kecheng; and veteran diplomat Lin Boqu. An example of a more recent leader from Hunan is former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.

== Geography ==

Hunan is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, about halfway along its length, situated between 108° 47&#x27;–114° 16&#x27; east longitude and 24° 37&#x27;–30° 08&#x27; north latitude. Hunan covers an area of , making it the 10th largest provincial-level division. The east, south and west sides of the province are surrounded by mountains and hills, such as the Wuling Mountains to the northwest, the Xuefeng Mountains to the west, the Nanling Mountains to the south, and the Luoxiao Mountains to the east. Mountains and hills occupy more than 80% of the province, and plains less than 20%. At 2,115.2 meters above sea level, the highest point in Hunan province is Lingfeng ().

The Xiang, the Zi, the Yuan and the Lishui Rivers converge on the Yangtze River at Lake Dongting in the north of Hunan. The center and northern parts are somewhat low and a U-shaped basin, open in the north and with Lake Dongting as its center. Most of Hunan lies in the basins of four major tributaries of the Yangtze River.

Lake Dongting is the largest lake in the province and the second largest freshwater lake of China.

The Xiaoxiang area and Lake Dongting figure prominently in Chinese poetry and paintings, particularly during the Song dynasty when they were associated with officials who had been unjustly dismissed.

Changsha (which means &quot;long sands&quot;) was an active ceramics district during the Tang dynasty, its tea bowls, ewers and other products mass-produced and shipped to China&#x27;s coastal cities for export abroad. An Arab dhow dated to the 830s and today known as the Belitung Shipwreck was discovered off the small island of Belitung, Indonesia with more than 60,000 pieces in its cargo. The salvaged cargo is today housed in nearby Singapore.

Hunan&#x27;s climate is subtropical; further, under the Köppen climate classification, the climate is classified as being humid subtropical (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with short, cool, damp winters, very hot and humid summers, and plenty of rainfall. January temperatures average , while July temperatures average around . Average annual precipitation is .
The Furongian Epoch in the Cambrian Period of geological time is named for Hunan; Furong () means &quot;lotus&quot; in Mandarin and refers to Hunan which is known as the &quot;lotus state&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==
Hunan is divided into fourteen prefecture-level divisions: thirteen prefecture-level cities and an autonomous prefecture:

The fourteen prefecture-level divisions of Hunan are subdivided into 122 county-level divisions (35 districts, 17 county-level cities, 63 counties, 7 autonomous counties). Those are in turn divided into 2587 township-level divisions (1098 towns, 1,158 townships, 98 ethnic townships, 225 subdistricts, and eight district public offices). At the year end of 2017, the total population is 68.6 million.

==Politics==
The politics of Hunan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The Governor of Hunan is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Hunan. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Hunan Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the &quot;Hunan CCP Party Chief&quot;.

== Economy ==
As of the mid-19th century, Hunan exported rhubarb, musk, honey, tobacco, hemp, and birds. The Lake Dongting area is an important center of ramie production, and Hunan is also an important center of tea cultivation.

Hunan was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

In recent years, Hunan has grown to become an important center for steel, machinery and electronics production, especially as China&#x27;s manufacturing sector moves away from coastal provinces such as Guangdong and Zhejiang.

The Lengshuijiang area is noted for its stibnite mines, and is one of the major centers of antimony extraction in China.

Hunan is also well known for a few global makers of construction equipment such as concrete pumps, cranes, etc. These companies include Sany Group, Zoomlion and Sunward. Sany is one of the world&#x27;s major players. The city of Liuyang is the world&#x27;s top center for manufacturing fireworks.

Hunan is the 9th-largest provincial economy of China, the third largest in the Central China region after Henan and Hubei, the fourth largest in the South Central China region after Guangdong, Henan and Hubei and the fourth largest among inland provinces after Henan, Sichuan and Hubei. As of 2021, Hunan&#x27;s nominal GDP was US$724 billion (CNY 4.6 trillion), appearing in the world&#x27;s top 20 largest sub-national economies with its GDP (Purchasing Power Parity) being over US$1.1 trillion, and its GDP (nominal) per capita exceeded US$10,900 (69,300 CNY), making it the 2nd richest in the Central China region after Hubei and the 3rd richest in South Central China region after Guangdong and Hubei.

As of 2020, Hunan&#x27;s GDP (nominal) was US$605 billion, making it larger than the economies of Poland (the 22nd biggest in the world), Thailand (the 2nd largest in ASEAN), and Nigeria (the largest in Africa).
