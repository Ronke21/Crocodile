<text>The Protectorate, officially the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, was the English form of government lasting from 16 December 1653 to 25 May 1659, under which the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, with their associated territories were joined together in the Commonwealth of England, governed by a Lord Protector. It began when Barebone&#x27;s Parliament was dissolved, and the Instrument of Government appointed Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth. Cromwell died in September 1658 and was succeeded by his son Richard Cromwell. 

Richard resigned in May 1659 due to his inability to control either the Army or Parliament. He was replaced by the English Committee of Safety, which dissolved the Third Protectorate Parliament, and reseated the Rump Parliament dismissed by his father in April 1653. This marked the end of the Protectorate, with the Rump acting as the legislature and the English Council of State as the executive.

==Background==

Since 1649 until the Protectorate, England, Ireland and later Scotland had been governed as a republic by the Council of State and the Rump Parliament. The , which established England, together with &quot;all the Dominions and Territoryes thereunto belonging&quot;, as a republic, had been passed on 19 May 1649, following the trial and execution of Charles I in January of that year. All of Ireland came under the same governance after the successful Cromwellian conquest of Ireland with the appointment of a Parliamentary military governor in Dublin.

On 20 April 1653, after learning that Parliament was attempting to stay in session despite an agreement to dissolve and having failed to come up with a working constitution, Cromwell, with the backing of the Grandees in the Army Council, marched soldiers into the debating chamber and forcibly ended the Rump&#x27;s session.

Within a month of the Rump&#x27;s dismissal, Oliver Cromwell, on the advice of Thomas Harrison and with the support of other officers in the Army, sent a request to Congregational churches in every county to nominate those they considered fit to take part in the new government. On 4 July a Nominated Assembly, nicknamed the &quot;Assembly of Saints&quot; or Barebone&#x27;s Parliament after one of its members, took on the role of more traditional English Parliaments. However, it proved just as difficult for the Grandees to control and was in addition a subject of popular ridicule and so on 8 December, MPs who supported Cromwell engineered its end by passing a dissolution motion at a time of day at which the house usually had few members in attendance. Those who refused to recognise the motion were forcibly ejected by soldiers.

The collapse of the radical consensus that had spawned the Nominated Assembly led to the Grandees passing the Instrument of Government in the Council of State, which paved the way for the Protectorate.

==Rule of Oliver Cromwell==

After the dissolution of Barebone&#x27;s Parliament, John Lambert put forward a new constitution known as the Instrument of Government, closely modelled on the Heads of Proposals. It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life to undertake &quot;the chief magistracy and the administration of government&quot;. He had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but was obliged under the Instrument to seek the majority vote of the Council of State. However, Cromwell&#x27;s power was also buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army, which he had built up during the civil wars and subsequently prudently guarded. Cromwell was sworn in as Lord Protector on 16 December 1653.

===Rule of the Major-Generals===
The First Protectorate Parliament met on 3 September 1654, and after some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by Cromwell, began to work on a moderate programme of constitutional reform. Rather than opposing Parliament&#x27;s bill, Cromwell dissolved it on 22 January 1655. After a royalist uprising, led by Sir John Penruddock, Cromwell, influenced by Lambert, divided England into military districts ruled by Army Major-Generals, who answered only to him. The fifteen major generals and deputy major generals, called &quot;godly governors&quot; were central not only to national security but also to Cromwell&#x27;s moral crusade. The generals supervised militia forces and security commissions, collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the English provinces and in Wales. Commissioners for securing the peace of the commonwealth were appointed to work with them in every county. While a few of the commissioners were career politicians, most were zealous Puritans who welcomed the major-generals, with open arms and embraced their work with enthusiasm. However, the major-generals lasted less than a year. Many feared that they threatened their reform efforts and authority. The major-generals&#x27; position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the Second Protectorate Parliament, instated in September 1656, voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell&#x27;s failure to support his men by sacrificing them to his opponents caused their demise. Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime.

===British Isles policy===
By the end of 1653, the Protectorate was in the unique position of being the first government in history to be in control of the entirety of the British Isles. The scope of the Instrument of Government extended to the governance of Scotland and Ireland; it provided for representatives from Scotland and Ireland, as well as England and Wales, to sit in Parliament in London.

The regime&#x27;s policy towards Ireland and Scotland initially had three components: secure the recent conquest of those countries with armies of occupation; punish those who had opposed the English conquest; reshape both countries in the image of England. Barry Coward observed that &quot;While there were reforming aspirations and coercion in the Protectorate&#x27;s British policies, these can hardly said to amount to a &#x27;British vision&#x27; designed to create a new British state from the separate kingdoms of England, Ireland and Scotland. What the regime seems to have intended was the anglicisation of the British Isles&quot;.

====Scotland====

Following the defeat of the Scottish army in the Anglo-Scottish war of 1650 to 1652 the Scottish government was dissolved and the English Parliament absorbed the kingdom of Scotland into the Commonwealth. Military rule was imposed, with 10,000 English troops garrisoned across the country to quell the threat of local uprisings. Negotiations between commissioners of the English Parliament and the deputies of Scotland&#x27;s shires and burghs began to formalise the incorporation of Scottish legal and political structures into the new British state. Under the terms of the Tender of Union, a declaration of the English Parliament proclaimed in Scotland in 1652, the Scottish Parliament was permanently dissolved and Scotland was given 30 seats in the Westminster Parliament. In 1654, the Council of State issued an &quot;Ordinance for uniting Scotland into one Commonwealth with England&quot;, which would be called the &quot;Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot;. This remained the legal basis of the union until the Ordinance became an Act of Union under the Second Protectorate Parliament on 26 June 1657. 

Initially, the country was run by eight English commissioners. In 1655 Lord Broghill was appointed as President of a new Council for Scotland which was part of an attempt to recast the government along civilian lines and to begin to win over the major landholders to the regime. The council was made up of six Englishmen and two Scots.

====Ireland====

With the completion of the brutal Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1653, the Protectorate implemented the Rump Parliament&#x27;s draconian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 which directed that large numbers of the Irish population be executed and that most Catholic property owners should lose their lands and be made to relocate to the west of the country. The English army of occupation stood at 9,000 in 1657, although it had been reduced significantly from its 1649 complement of 35,000. The Instrument of Government specified that Ireland was entitled to 30 seats in the Parliament in London, the same number as Scotland. Initially, the country was ruled on behalf of the Protectorate by Cromwell&#x27;s son-in-law, Charles Fleetwood, a military governor with the title Lord Deputy of Ireland, and a group of hard line radical parliamentary commissioners. As in Scotland, a more moderate policy was adopted in 1655. In that year, Cromwell sent his son, Henry, to Ireland who assumed control over the country and adopted a more conciliatory approach to the country&#x27;s administration.

===Foreign policy===
During this period, Oliver Cromwell also faced challenges in foreign policy. The First Anglo-Dutch War, which had broken out in 1652, against the Dutch Republic, was eventually won by Admiral Robert Blake in 1654. Having negotiated peace with the Dutch, Cromwell then proceeded to engage the Spanish Empire in warfare through his Western Design. That involved secret preparations for an attack on the Spanish colonies in the Caribbean and resulted in the invasion of Jamaica, which then became an English colony. The Lord Protector became aware of the contribution the Jewish community made to the economic success of the Netherlands, now England&#x27;s leading commercial rival. Cromwell&#x27;s toleration of private worship of non-Puritans led to his encouragement of Jews to return to England, 350 years after their banishment by Edward I, in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars.

In 1655 a crypto-Jew known as Simón de Casseres proposed to Cromwell a plan to take over Spanish-rule Chile with only four ships and a thousand men. However English plans to engage in Chile came into fruition only in 1669, with John Narborough&#x27;s expedition.

After the Battle of the Dunes (1658), the town of Dunkirk was awarded by France to the Protectorate. It would be sold back to France by Charles II in 1662.

===Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s role===

In 1657, Oliver Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament as part of a revised constitutional settlement. That presented him with a dilemma since he had been instrumental in abolishing the monarchy. Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability that it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657, he made it clear that God&#x27;s providence had spoken against the office of king: “I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build Jericho again&quot;.

Instead, Cromwell was ceremonially reinstalled as Lord Protector, with greater powers than had previously been granted him under this title, at Westminster Hall. He sat upon King Edward&#x27;s Chair, which had been specially moved from Westminster Abbey for the occasion. The event in part echoed a coronation by using many of its symbols and regalia, such as a purple ermine-lined robe, a sword of justice, a sceptre and an ermine-lined coronet but not a crown or an orb. However, a crown and an orb were present on the lord protector&#x27;s seal. However, most notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell&#x27;s new rights and powers were laid out in the Humble Petition and Advice, a legislative instrument that replaced the Instrument of Government. Cromwell himself, however, was at pains to minimise his role by describing himself as a constable or watchman. However, Cromwell &quot;had never gained the willing consent of the nation&quot;, and the Protectorate relied on armed force.

==Rule of Richard Cromwell==

After Oliver&#x27;s death in September 1658, his third son, Richard Cromwell, succeeded as Lord Protector. The impression of strength and durability of the Protectorate when Richard succeeded proved deceptive; the lack of unity would destroy the Protectorate.

Richard sought to expand the basis for the Protectorate beyond the army to civilians. He summoned a Parliament in 1659, but the republicans engaged in &quot;endless obstruction and filibustering&quot;, attacked the &quot;quasi-monarchal&quot; aspects of the Protectorate and &quot;condemned Oliver&#x27;s rule as a period of tyranny and economic depression&quot;. Both father and son were seen as leading a tyrannical government of the &quot;Sword&quot;, in diametric opposition to a &quot;Civil&quot; government with a free parliament.

Three things undermined the Protectorate: the &quot;anxieties of the army, the irresponsibility of the Parliament and the rashness of Richard Cromwell&quot;. What ultimately prevented the retention of the Protectorate was the opposition of the &quot;junior officers&quot; and &quot;many of the common soldiers&quot;.

Richard had proved that he could neither manage the Parliament nor control the army. On 7 May, a Committee of Safety was formed on the authority of the Rump Parliament, displacing the Protector&#x27;s Council of State, and was in turn replaced by a new Council of State on 19 May 1659. &quot;Richard was never formally deposed or arrested, but allowed to fade away. The Protectorate was treated as having been from the first a mere usurpation&quot;.

==Aftermath and restoration==

After Richard Cromwell was removed from power by the Grandees of the New Army, the Rump Parliament was instated and soon after was replaced by the Committee of Safety and Council of State under the authority of Charles Fleetwood. The Committee of Safety then ordered General John Lambert to meet George Monck, the commander of English forces in Scotland and a royalist sympathizer, to force Monck&#x27;s submission or defeat. Monck instead marched south. As Lambert&#x27;s army marched north, his ranks began to dwindle and he was ultimately forced to retreat back to London.

When Monck reached London he allowed Presbyterian members, who had been removed by Pride&#x27;s Purge, to re-enter Parliament on 21 February 1660. On 16 March 1660, the Long Parliament dissolved itself after preparations were made for the Convention Parliament of 1660 to succeed it. On 4 April 1660, Charles II proclaimed the Declaration of Breda, which granted a pardon for all crimes committed during the Civil War and the Interregnum to those who recognized him as the lawful king. On 8 May 1660, the Convention Parliament declared Charles II the lawful successor of Charles I and king. The Convention Parliament then began the transition back to monarchy through the passage of the Restoration Settlement.

According to Derek Hirst, outside of politics and religion, the 1640s and the 1650s saw a revived economy characterized by growth in manufacturing, the elaboration of financial and credit instruments and the commercialization of communication. The gentry found time for leisure activities such as horse racing and bowling. In high culture, important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research and an expansion of publishing. All of those trends were discussed in depth at the newly-established coffeehouses.

<doc id="161947" wikidata="Q193635" url="?curid=161947" title="Alan Greenspan">
<text>Alan Greenspan (born March 6, 1926) is an American economist who served as the 13th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006. He worked as a private adviser and provided consulting for firms through his company, Greenspan Associates LLC.

First nominated to the Federal Reserve by President Ronald Reagan in August 1987, Greenspan was reappointed at successive four-year intervals until retiring on January 31, 2006, after the second-longest tenure in the position, behind only William McChesney Martin. President George W. Bush appointed Ben Bernanke as his successor. 
Greenspan came to the Federal Reserve Board from a consulting career. Although he was subdued in his public appearances, favorable media coverage raised his profile to a point that several observers likened him to a &quot;rock star&quot;. Democratic leaders of Congress criticized him for politicizing his office because of his support for Social Security privatization and tax cuts.

Many have argued that the &quot;easy-money&quot; policies of the Fed during Greenspan&#x27;s tenure, including the practice known as the &quot;Greenspan put&quot;, were a leading cause of the dot-com bubble and subprime mortgage crisis (the latter occurring within a year of his leaving the Fed), which, said &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;tarnished his reputation&quot;. Yale economist Robert Shiller argues that &quot;once stocks fell, real estate became the primary outlet for the speculative frenzy that the stock market had unleashed&quot;. Greenspan has argued that the housing bubble was not a result of low-interest short-term rates but rather a worldwide phenomenon caused by the progressive decline in long-term interest rates – a direct consequence of the relationship between high savings rates in the developing world and its inverse in the developed world. 

==Early life and education==
Greenspan was born in the Washington Heights area of New York City. His father, Herbert Greenspan, was of Romanian Jewish descent, and his mother, Rose Goldsmith, was of Hungarian Jewish descent. After his parents divorced, Greenspan grew up with his mother in the household of his maternal grandparents who were born in Russia. His father worked as a stockbroker and consultant in New York City.

Greenspan attended George Washington High School from 1940 until he graduated in June 1943, where one of his classmates was John Kemeny. He played clarinet and saxophone along with Stan Getz. He further studied clarinet at the Juilliard School from 1943 to 1944. Among his bandmates in the Woody Herman band was Leonard Garment, Richard Nixon&#x27;s special counsel. In 1945, Greenspan attended New York University&#x27;s Stern School of Business, where he earned a B.A. degree in economics &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1948 and an M.A. degree in economics in 1950. At Columbia University, he pursued advanced economic studies under Arthur Burns but withdrew because of his increasing work demand at Townsend-Greenspan &amp; Company.

In 1977, Greenspan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from New York University. His dissertation is not available from the university since it was removed at Greenspan&#x27;s request in 1987, when he became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. In April 2008, however, &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; obtained a copy and notes that it includes &quot;a discussion of soaring housing prices and their effect on consumer spending; it even anticipates a bursting housing bubble&quot;.

==Career==
===Before the Federal Reserve===
During his economics studies at New York University, Greenspan worked under Eugene Banks, a managing director at the Wall Street investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman, in the firm&#x27;s equity research department. From 1948 to 1953, Greenspan worked as an analyst at the National Industrial Conference Board (currently known as the Conference Board), a business- and industry-oriented think tank in New York City. Before he was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve, from 1955 to 1987, Greenspan was chairman and president of Townsend-Greenspan &amp; Co., Inc., an economics consulting firm in New York City. His 32-year stint there was interrupted only from 1974 to 1977, when he served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, under President Gerald Ford.

In mid-1968, Greenspan agreed to serve as Richard Nixon&#x27;s coordinator on domestic policy in the nomination campaign. Greenspan has also served as a corporate director for Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa); Automatic Data Processing; Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.; General Foods; J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.; Morgan Guaranty Trust Company; Mobil Corporation; and the Pittston Company. He was a director of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization between 1982 and 1988. He also served as a member of the influential Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty in 1984.

===Chairman of the Federal Reserve===
On June 2, 1987, President Ronald Reagan nominated Greenspan as a successor to Paul Volcker, as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Senate confirmed him on August 11, 1987. Investor, author and commentator Jim Rogers has said that Greenspan lobbied to get this chairmanship.

Two months after his confirmation, Greenspan said immediately following the 1987 stock market crash that the Fed &quot;affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system&quot;. Although the Federal Reserve followed its announcement with monetary policy actions, which became known as the Greenspan put, George H. W. Bush attributed his re-election loss to a sluggish response. Democratic president Bill Clinton reappointed Greenspan, and consulted him on economic matters. Greenspan lent support to Clinton&#x27;s 1993 deficit reduction program. Greenspan was fundamentally a monetarist and Austrian Economist in orientation on the economy, and his monetary policy decisions largely followed standard Taylor rule prescriptions (see Taylor 1993 and 1999). Greenspan also played a key role in organizing the U.S. bailout of Mexico during the 1994–1995 Mexican peso crisis.

In 2000, Greenspan raised interest rates several times; these actions were believed by many to have caused the bursting of the dot-com bubble. According to Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, however, &quot;he didn&#x27;t raise interest rates to curb the market&#x27;s enthusiasm; he didn&#x27;t even seek to impose margin requirements on stock market investors. Instead, he waited until the bubble burst, as it did in 2000, then tried to clean up the mess afterward&quot;. E. Ray Canterbery agrees with Krugman&#x27;s criticism.

In January 2001, Greenspan, in support of President Bush&#x27;s proposed tax decrease, stated that the federal surplus could accommodate a significant tax cut while paying down the national debt.

In autumn 2001, as a decisive reaction to the September 11 attacks and various corporate scandals which undermined the economy, the Greenspan-led Federal Reserve initiated a series of interest cuts that brought down the federal funds rate to 1% in 2004. While presenting the Federal Reserve&#x27;s Monetary Policy Report in July 2002, he said that &quot;It is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past. It is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously&quot;, and suggested that financial markets need to be more regulated. His critics, led by Steve Forbes, attributed the rapid rise in commodity prices and gold to Greenspan&#x27;s loose monetary policy, which Forbes believed had caused excessive asset inflation and a weak dollar. By late 2004, the price of gold was higher than its 12-year moving average.

Greenspan advised senior members of the George W. Bush administration to depose Saddam Hussein for the sake of the oil markets. He believed that even a moderate disruption to the flow of oil could translate into high oil prices, which could lead to &quot;chaos&quot; in the global economy and bring the industrial world &quot;to its knees&quot;. He feared that Saddam could seize control of the Straits of Hormuz and restrict the transport of oil through them. In a 2007 interview, he said, &quot;people do not realize in this country, for example, how tenuous our ties to international energy are. That is, we on a daily basis require continuous flow. If that flow is shut off, it causes catastrophic effects in the industrial world. And it&#x27;s that which made him [Saddam] far more important to get out than bin Laden.&quot;

On May 18, 2004, Greenspan was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve for an unprecedented fifth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. He was previously appointed to the post by Presidents Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.

In a May 2005 speech, Greenspan stated: &quot;Two years ago at this conference I argued that the growing array of derivatives and the related application of more-sophisticated methods for measuring and managing risks had been key factors underlying the remarkable resilience of the banking system, which had recently shrugged off severe shocks to the economy and the financial system. At the same time, I indicated some concerns about the risks associated with derivatives, including the risks posed by concentration in certain derivatives markets, notably the over-the-counter (OTC) markets for U.S. dollar interest rate options.&quot;

Greenspan opposed tariffs against the People&#x27;s Republic of China for its refusal to let the yuan rise, suggesting instead that any American workers displaced by Chinese trade could be compensated through unemployment insurance and retraining programs.

Greenspan&#x27;s term as a member of the board ended on January 31, 2006, and Ben Bernanke was confirmed as his successor.

As chairman of the board, Greenspan did not give any broadcast interviews from 1987 through 2005.

===After the Federal Reserve===
Immediately after leaving the Fed, Greenspan formed an economic consulting firm, Greenspan Associates LLC. He also accepted an honorary (unpaid) position at HM Treasury in the United Kingdom.

On February 26, 2007, Greenspan forecast a possible recession in the United States before or in early 2008. Stabilizing corporate profits are said to have influenced his comments. The following day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 416 points, losing 3.3% of its value.

In May 2007, Greenspan was hired as a special consultant by Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) to participate in their quarterly economic forums and speak privately with the bond managers about Fed interest rate policy.

In August 2007, Deutsche Bank announced that it would be retaining Greenspan as a senior advisor to its investment banking team and clients.

In mid-January 2008, hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co. hired Greenspan as an adviser. According to the terms of their agreement, he was not to advise any other hedge fund while working for Paulson. In 2007, Paulson had foreseen the collapse of the sub-prime housing market and hired Goldman Sachs to package their sub-prime holdings into derivatives and sell them. Some economic commentators blamed this collapse on Greenspan&#x27;s policies while at the Fed.

On April 30, 2009, Greenspan offered a defense of the H-1B visa program, telling a U.S. Senate subcommittee that the visa quota is &quot;far too small to meet the need&quot; and saying that it protects U.S. workers from global competition, creating a &quot;privileged elite&quot;. Testifying on immigration reform before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship, he said more skilled immigration was needed &quot;as the economy copes with the forthcoming retirement wave of skilled baby boomers&quot;.

===Memoir===
Greenspan wrote a memoir titled &quot;The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World&quot;, published September 17, 2007. Greenspan says that he wrote the book in longhand mostly while soaking in the bathtub, a habit he regularly employs since injuring his back in 1971. Greenspan discusses in his book, among other things, his history in government and economics, capitalism and other economic systems, current issues in the global economy, and future issues that face the global economy. In the book, Greenspan criticizes President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and the Republican-controlled Congress for abandoning the Republican Party&#x27;s principles on spending and deficits. Greenspan&#x27;s criticisms of President Bush include his refusal to veto spending bills, sending the country into increasingly deep deficits, and for &quot;putting political imperatives ahead of sound economic policies&quot;. Greenspan writes, &quot;They swapped principle for power. They ended up with neither. They deserved to lose [the 2006 election]&quot;. He praised Bill Clinton above all the other presidents for whom he&#x27;d worked for his &quot;consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth&quot;. Although he respected what he saw as Richard Nixon&#x27;s immense intelligence, Greenspan found him to be &quot;sadly paranoid, misanthropic and cynical&quot;. He said of Gerald Ford that he &quot;was as close to normal as you get in a president, but he was never elected&quot;. Regarding future U.S. economic policy, Greenspan recommends improving the U.S. primary and secondary education systems. He asserts this would narrow the inequality between the minority of high-income earners and most workers whose wages have not grown in proportion with globalization and the nation&#x27;s GDP growth.

==Objectivism==

In the early 1950s, Greenspan began an association with novelist and Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand. Greenspan was introduced to Rand by his first wife, Joan Mitchell. Rand nicknamed Greenspan &quot;the undertaker&quot; because of his penchant for dark clothing and reserved demeanor. Although Greenspan was initially a logical positivist, he was converted to Rand&#x27;s philosophy of Objectivism by her associate Nathaniel Branden. He became one of the members of Rand&#x27;s inner circle, the Ayn Rand Collective, who read &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; while it was being written. During the 1950s and 1960s, Greenspan was a proponent of Objectivism, writing articles for Objectivist newsletters and contributing several essays for Rand&#x27;s 1966 book &quot;&quot; including an essay supporting the gold standard. During the 1960s, Greenspan offered a ten-lecture course, &quot;The Economics of a Free Society&quot;, under the auspices of the Nathaniel Branden Institute. The course highlighted the causes of prosperity and depression, the consequences of government intervention, and the fallacies of collectivist economics. Rand stood beside him at his 1974 swearing-in as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Greenspan and Rand remained friends until her death in 1982.

Greenspan has come under criticism from Harry Binswanger, who believes his actions while at work for the Federal Reserve and his publicly expressed opinions on other issues show abandonment of Objectivist and free market principles. When questioned in relation to this, however, he has said that in a democratic society individuals have to make compromises with each other over conflicting ideas of how money should be handled. He said he himself had to make such compromises, because he believes that &quot;we did extremely well&quot; without a central bank and with a gold standard. In a congressional hearing on October 23, 2008, Greenspan admitted that his free-market ideology shunning certain regulations was flawed. When asked about free markets and Rand&#x27;s ideas, however, Greenspan clarified his stance on &quot;laissez faire&quot; capitalism and asserted that in a democratic society there could be no better alternative. He stated that the errors that were made stemmed not from the principle, but from the application of competitive markets in &quot;assuming what the nature of risks would be&quot;.

E. Ray Canterbery has chronicled Greenspan&#x27;s relationship with Rand, and has concluded that the influence has had pernicious effects on Greenspan&#x27;s monetary policy.

==Reception==

===Housing bubble===
In the wake of the subprime mortgage and credit crisis in 2007, Greenspan stated that there was a bubble in the U.S. housing market, warning in 2007 of &quot;large double digit declines&quot; in home values &quot;larger than most people expect&quot;. Greenspan also noted, however, &quot;I really didn&#x27;t get it until very late in 2005 and 2006.&quot;

Greenspan stated that the housing bubble was &quot;fundamentally engendered by the decline in real long-term interest rates&quot;, though he also claims that long-term interest rates are beyond the control of central banks because &quot;the market value of global long-term securities is approaching $100 trillion&quot; and thus these and other asset markets are large enough that they &quot;now swamp the resources of central banks&quot;.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to reduce the federal funds rate from 3.5% to 3.0%. Then, after the accounting scandals of 2002, the Fed dropped the federal funds rate from then current 1.25% to 1.00%. Greenspan stated that this drop in rates would have the effect of leading to a surge in home sales and refinancing, adding that &quot;Besides sustaining the demand for new construction, mortgage markets have also been a powerful stabilizing force over the past two years of economic distress by facilitating the extraction of some of the equity that homeowners have built up over the years&quot;.

According to some, however, Greenspan&#x27;s policies of adjusting interest rates to historic lows contributed to a housing bubble in the United States. The Federal Reserve acknowledged the connection between lower interest rates, higher home values, and the increased liquidity the higher home values bring to the overall economy: &quot;Like other asset prices, house prices are influenced by interest rates, and in some countries, the housing market is a key channel of monetary policy transmission.&quot;

In a February 23, 2004, speech, Greenspan suggested that more homeowners should consider taking out adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) where the interest rate adjusts itself to the current interest in the market. The Fed&#x27;s own funds rate was at a then all-time-low of 1%. A few months after his recommendation, Greenspan began raising interest rates, in a series of rate hikes that would bring the funds rate to 5.25% about two years later. A triggering factor in the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis is believed to be the many subprime ARMs that reset at much higher interest rates than what the borrower paid during the first few years of the mortgage.

In 2008, Greenspan expressed great frustration that the February 23 speech was used to criticize him on ARMs and the subprime mortgage crisis, and stated that he had made countervailing comments eight days after it that praised traditional fixed-rate mortgages. In that speech, Greenspan had suggested that lenders should offer to home purchasers a greater variety of &quot;mortgage product alternatives&quot; other than traditional fixed-rate mortgages. Greenspan also praised the rise of the subprime mortgage industry and its tools for assessing credit-worthiness:
The subprime mortgage industry collapsed in March 2007, with many of the largest lenders filing for bankruptcy protection in the face of spiraling foreclosure rates. For these reasons, Greenspan has been criticized for his role in the rise of the housing bubble and the subsequent problems in the mortgage industry, as well as &quot;engineering&quot; the housing bubble itself.

In 2004, &quot;Businessweek&quot; magazine analysts argued: &quot;It was the Federal Reserve-engineered decline in rates that inflated the housing bubble ... the most troublesome aspect of the price runup is that many recent buyers are squeezing into houses that they can barely afford by taking advantage of the lower rates available from adjustable-rate mortgages. That leaves them fully exposed to rising rates.&quot;

In September 2008, Joseph Stiglitz stated that Greenspan &quot;didn&#x27;t really believe in regulation; when the excesses of the financial system were noted, (he and others) called for self-regulation—an oxymoron&quot;. Greenspan, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, says he himself is blameless. On April 6, 2005, Greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: &quot;Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the enormous portfolios of the companies—nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market—posed significant risks to the nation&#x27;s financial system should either company face significant problems.&quot; Despite this, Greenspan still claims to be a firm believer in free markets, although in his 2007 biography he wrote, &quot;History has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums&quot; as seen before the credit crisis of 2008.

In 2009, Robert Reich wrote that &quot;Greenspan&#x27;s worst move was to contribute to the giant housing bubble and the worst worldwide crash since the Great Depression. In 2004 he lowered interest rates to 1%, enabling banks to borrow money for free, adjusted for inflation. Naturally, the banks wanted to borrow as much as they possibly could, then lend it out, earning nice profits. The situation screamed for government oversight of lending institutions, lest the banks lend to unfit borrowers. He refused, trusting the market to weed out bad credit risks. It did not.&quot;

In congressional testimony on October 23, 2008, Greenspan finally conceded error on regulation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;a humbled Mr. Greenspan admitted that he had put too much faith in the self-correcting power of free markets and had failed to anticipate the self-destructive power of wanton mortgage lending ... Mr. Greenspan refused to accept blame for the crisis but acknowledged that his belief in deregulation had been shaken&quot;. Although many Republican lawmakers tried to blame the housing bubble on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Greenspan placed far more blame on Wall Street for bundling subprime mortgages into securities.

===2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession===
In March 2008, Greenspan wrote an article for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;″ Economists&#x27; Forum in which he said that the 2007–2008 financial crisis in the United States is likely to be judged as the most wrenching since the end of World War II. In it he argued: &quot;We will never be able to anticipate all discontinuities in financial markets.&quot; He concluded: &quot;It is important, indeed crucial, that any reforms in, and adjustments to, the structure of markets and regulation not inhibit our most reliable and effective safeguards against cumulative economic failure: market flexibility and open competition.&quot; The article attracted a number of critical responses from forum contributors, who, finding causation between Greenspan&#x27;s policies and the discontinuities in financial markets that followed, criticized Greenspan mainly for what many believed to be his unbalanced and immovable ideological suppositions about global capitalism and free competitive markets. Notable critics included J. Bradford DeLong, Paul Krugman, Alice Rivlin, Michael Hudson, and Willem Buiter.

Greenspan responded to his critics in a follow-up article in which he defended his ideology as applied to his conceptual and policy framework, which, among other things, prohibited him from exerting real pressure against the burgeoning housing bubble or, in his words, &quot;leaning against the wind&quot;. Greenspan argued, &quot;My view of the range of dispersion of outcomes has been shaken, but not my judgment that free competitive markets are by far the unrivaled way to organize economies&quot;. He concluded: &quot;We have tried regulation ranging from heavy to central planning. None meaningfully worked. Do we wish to retest the evidence?&quot; &quot;Financial Times&quot; associate editor and chief economics commentator Martin Wolf defended Greenspan primarily as a scapegoat for the market turmoil. Several notable contributors in defense of Greenspan included Stephen S. Roach, Allan Meltzer, and Robert Brusca.

However, an October 15, 2008, article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; analyzing the origins of the economic crisis claims that Greenspan vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives, and actively sought to undermine the office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when the commission sought to initiate regulation of derivatives. Meanwhile, Greenspan recommended improving mark-to-market regulations to avoid having derivatives or other complex assets marked to a distressed or illiquid market during times of material adverse conditions seen during the late 2000s credit crisis.

Greenspan was not alone in his opposition to derivatives regulation. In a 1999 government report that was a key driver in the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000—legislation that clarified that most over-the-counter derivatives were outside the regulatory authority of any government agency—Greenspan was joined by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman William Ranier in concluding that &quot;under many circumstances, the trading of financial derivatives by eligible swap participants should be excluded from the CEA&quot; (Commodity Exchange Act). Other government agencies also supported that view.

In Congressional testimony on October 23, 2008, Greenspan acknowledged that he was &quot;partially&quot; wrong in opposing regulation and stated &quot;Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder&#x27;s equity—myself especially—are in a state of shocked disbelief.&quot; Referring to his free-market ideology, Greenspan said: &quot;I have found a flaw. I don&#x27;t know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact.&quot; When Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) pressed him to clarify his words. &quot;In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working,&quot; Waxman said. &quot;Absolutely, precisely&quot;, Greenspan replied. &quot;You know, that&#x27;s precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well.&quot; Greenspan admitted fault in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions didn&#x27;t protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected.

Matt Taibbi described the Greenspan put and its bad consequences saying: &quot;every time the banks blew up a speculative bubble, they could go back to the Fed and borrow money at zero or one or two percent, and then start the game all over&quot;, thereby making it &quot;almost impossible&quot; for the banks to lose money. He also called Greenspan a &quot;classic con man&quot; who, through political savvy, &quot;flattered and bullshitted his way up the Matterhorn of American power and ... jacked himself off to the attention of Wall Street for 20 consecutive years&quot;.

In the documentary film &quot;Inside Job&quot;, Greenspan is cited as one of the persons responsible for the 2007–2008 financial crisis. He is also named in &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis&quot;.

===Political views and alleged politicization of office===
Greenspan describes himself as a &quot;lifelong libertarian Republican&quot;.

In March 2005, in reaction to Greenspan&#x27;s support of President George W. Bush&#x27;s plan to partially privatize Social Security, then-Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid attacked Greenspan as &quot;one of the biggest political hacks we have in Washington&quot; and criticized him for supporting Bush&#x27;s 2001 tax cut plan. Then-Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi added that there were serious questions about the Fed&#x27;s independence as a result of Greenspan&#x27;s public statements. Greenspan also received criticism from Democratic Congressman Barney Frank and others for supporting Bush&#x27;s Social Security plans favoring private accounts. Greenspan had said Bush&#x27;s model has &quot;the seeds of developing full funding by its very nature. As I&#x27;ve said before, I&#x27;ve always supported moves to full funding in the context of a private account&quot;.

Others, like Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, disagreed that Greenspan was too deferential to Bush, stating that Greenspan &quot;has been an independent player at the Fed for a long time under both parties and made an enormous positive contribution&quot;.

Economist Paul Krugman wrote that Greenspan was a &quot;three-card maestro&quot; with a &quot;lack of sincerity&quot; who, &quot;by repeatedly shilling for whatever the Bush administration wants, has betrayed the trust placed in the Fed chairman&quot;.

Republican Senator Jim Bunning, who opposed Greenspan&#x27;s fifth reconfirmation, charged that Greenspan should comment only on monetary policy, not fiscal policy. Greenspan had used his position as Fed chairman to comment upon fiscal policy as early as 1993, however, when he supported President Clinton&#x27;s deficit reduction plan, which included tax increases and budget cuts.

In an October 2011 lecture addressing the Occupy movement, Noam Chomsky characterized portions of Greenspan&#x27;s February 1997 testimony to the U.S. Senate as an example of the self-serving attitudes of the so-called 1%. In that testimony, Greenspan had stated that growing worker insecurity is a significant factor keeping inflation and inflation expectation low, thereby promoting long-term investment.

==Personal life==

Greenspan has married twice. His first marriage was to Canadian artist Joan Mitchell in October 1952; the marriage ended in annullment 10 months later. He dated newswoman Barbara Walters in the late 1970s. In December 1984, Greenspan began dating journalist Andrea Mitchell. Greenspan at the time was 58 and Mitchell was 38. In April 1997, they were married by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

<text>[[Cognitive science]] is the scientific study either of mind or of intelligence (e.g. Luger 1994).
Practically every formal introduction to cognitive science stresses that it is a highly interdisciplinary research area in which psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, computer science (in particular artificial intelligence), anthropology, and biology are its principal specialized or applied branches.
Therefore, we may distinguish cognitive studies of either human or animal brains, the mind and the brain.

<text>Floyd Patterson (January 4, 1935 – May 11, 2006) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1952 to 1972, and twice reigned as the world heavyweight champion between 1956 and 1962. At the age of 21, he became the youngest boxer in history to win the title, and was also the first heavyweight to regain the title after losing it. As an amateur, he won a gold medal in the middleweight division at the 1952 Summer Olympics. He has been named among the top 15 heavyweights of all time.

In 1956 and 1960, Patterson was voted Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.

==Early life==
Born January 4, 1935, into a poor family in Waco, North Carolina, Patterson was one of eleven children. Savannah Joe Patterson was his first cousin from out of Arkansas, he went and visited during the early summer years. He experienced an insular and troubled childhood. His family moved to Brooklyn, New York, in the neighborhood of Bedford–Stuyvesant otherwise known as Bed-Stuy. During this time, his parents were working extremely hard to provide for the family. There were eleven children to feed. Patterson felt helpless that he could not help his mother and father more. He felt stupid and powerless. Starting at the age of nine, Floyd became a truant and petty thief. It began with him stealing little things like milk and fruit to bring back to his mother to help. However, as he transitioned into a teenager, he would frequently be seen in court for- stealing, truancy, and running away. He estimated that he had been in court, thirty to forty times. At age 10, a judge was so tired of seeing him in court that he was sent to the Wiltwyck School for Boys, a reform school in Esopus, New York, He was sent off there in September 1945. During this time, he was furious thinking he was being sent to jail until his mother explained the blessing. He credited this to turning his life around. He stayed there for almost two years. He attended high school in New Paltz, New York, where he succeeded in all sports.

Patterson took up boxing at age fourteen, and was training with the Bedford-Stuyvesant Boxing Association Gym. Three years later, he won the gold medal in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics as a middleweight. In 1952, he won the National Amateur Middleweight Championship and New York Golden Gloves Middleweight Championship. At that time he was spotted by Cus D&#x27;Amato, and trained at the Gramercy Gym.

Patterson&#x27;s younger brother Raymond (born 1942) also became a professional heavyweight boxer and has lived in Gothenburg, Sweden, since 1965 and has worked as a truck driver at Volvo Lastvagnar after his boxing career.

===Olympic results===
* Round of 16: Defeated Omar Tebakka (France) on points, 3–0
* Quarterfinal: Defeated Leonardus Jansen (Netherlands) by a first-round stoppage
* Semifinal: Defeated Stig Sjölin (Sweden) by disqualification in the third round
* Defeated Vasile Tiță (Romania) by a first-round knockout

Patterson&#x27;s amateur record was 40 wins (37 by knockout) and 4 defeats.

Patterson carried his hands higher than most boxers, in front of his face. Sportswriters called Patterson&#x27;s style a &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; stance.

==Professional career==
Patterson turned pro and steadily rose through the ranks, his only early defeat being an eight-round decision to former light heavyweight champion Joey Maxim on June 7, 1954, at the Eastern Parkway Arena in Brooklyn, New York.

===Championship===

Although Patterson fought around the light heavyweight limit for much of his early career, he and manager Cus D&#x27;Amato always had plans to fight for the Heavyweight Championship. In fact, D&#x27;Amato made these plans clear as early as 1954, when he told the press that Patterson was aiming for the heavyweight title. However, after Rocky Marciano announced his retirement as World Heavyweight Champion on April 27, 1956, Patterson was ranked by The &quot;Ring&quot; magazine as the top light heavyweight contender. After Marciano&#x27;s announcement, Jim Norris of the International Boxing Club stated that Patterson was one of the six fighters who would take part in an elimination tournament to crown Marciano&#x27;s successor. &quot;The Ring&quot; then moved Patterson into the heavyweight rankings, at number five.

====Patterson vs. Moore====
After beating Tommy &quot;Hurricane&quot; Jackson in an elimination fight, Patterson faced Light Heavyweight Champion Archie Moore on November 30, 1956, for the World Heavyweight Championship. He beat Moore by a knockout in five rounds and became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion in history, at the age of 21 years, 10 months, 3 weeks and 5 days. He was the first Olympic gold medalist to win a professional heavyweight title.
====Patterson vs. Johansson I, II &amp; III====
After a series of defenses against fringe contenders (Hurricane Jackson, Pete Rademacher, Roy Harris, and Brian London), Patterson met Ingemar Johansson of Sweden, the number one contender, in the first of three fights. Johansson triumphed over Patterson on June 26, 1959, with the referee Ruby Goldstein stopping the fight in the third round after the Swede had knocked Patterson down seven times. Johansson became Sweden&#x27;s first World Heavyweight Champion, thus becoming a national hero as the first European to defeat an American for the title since 1933.

Patterson knocked out Johansson in the fifth round of their rematch on June 20, 1960, to become the first man in history to regain the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. Johansson hit the canvas hard, seemingly out before he landed flat on his back. With glazed eyes, blood trickling from his mouth and his left foot quivering, he was counted out. Johansson laying unconscious for five minutes before he was helped onto a stool.

A third fight between them was held on March 13, 1961, and while Johansson put Patterson on the floor, Patterson retained his title by knockout in the sixth round to win the rubber match in which Patterson was decked twice and Johansson once, in the first round. Johansson had landed both right hands over Floyd&#x27;s left jab. After getting up from the second knockdown, Floyd abandoned his jab and connected with a left hook that knocked down Johansson. After that, Patterson came on with a strong body attack that wore down Johansson. In the sixth round, Johansson caught Patterson with a solid right. But the power in Johansson&#x27;s punches was gone. Patterson won the fight in the sixth round by knockout.

After the third Johansson fight, Patterson defended the title in Toronto on December 4 against Tom McNeeley and retained the title with a fourth-round knockout. However he did not fight number-one contender Sonny Liston. This was due in part to Cus D&#x27;Amato, who did not want Patterson in the ring with a boxer with mob connections. As a result, D&#x27;Amato turned down any challenges involving the IBC. Eventually, due to a monetary dispute with Jimmy Jacobs, Patterson removed D&#x27;Amato from handling his business affairs and agreed to fight Liston.

====Patterson vs. Liston I &amp; II====
Leading up to the fight, Liston was the major betting-line favorite, though &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; predicted that Patterson would win in 15 rounds. Jim Braddock, Jersey Joe Walcott, Ezzard Charles, Rocky Marciano and Ingemar Johansson picked Patterson to win. The fight also carried a number of social implications. Liston&#x27;s connections with the mob were well known and the NAACP was concerned about having to deal with Liston&#x27;s visibility as World Champion and had encouraged Patterson not to fight Liston, fearing that a Liston victory would tarnish the civil rights movement. Patterson said John F. Kennedy also did not want him to fight Liston.

In David Remnick&#x27;s book, &quot;King of the World,&quot; he calls Patterson a &quot;sensitive&quot; champion. Patterson was very open about his fears and feelings going into a fight, which was new behavior in the world of boxing. He was regarded as a very polite, well-mannered, and likeable champion. This contrasted the media&#x27;s portrayal of Liston, who&#x27;s mob ties and criminal history made it easy to paint as the villain of the fight. In the media, Patterson was painted as the good guy, and Liston was the antagonist. This rhetoric surrounded the fight, raising the stakes and putting pressure on Patterson to retain his title.

Patterson lost his title to Liston in Chicago on September 25, 1962, by a first-round knockout in front of 18,894 fans. The two fighters were a marked contrast. In the ring, Liston&#x27;s size and power proved too much for Patterson&#x27;s guile and agility. However, Patterson did not use his speed to his benefit. According to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Gilbert Rogin, Patterson did not punch enough and frequently tried to clinch with Liston. Liston battered Patterson with body shots and then shortened up and connected with two double hooks high on the head. The result at the time was the third-fastest knockout in boxing history. After being knocked out, Patterson left Comiskey Park in Chicago wearing dark glasses and a fake beard for the drive back to New York. After the fight, questions were raised on whether the fight was fixed to set up a more lucrative rematch. Overnight, Patterson seemed to lose his public support as a result of his swift knockout. Despite the defeat, Patterson received $2 million, to be paid over 17 years.

The rematch was set for April 1963; however, Liston injured his knee swinging a golf club and the fight was delayed three months to July 22. It was the first million-dollar purse with both fighters receiving $1,434,000 each. In Las Vegas that night, Patterson attempted to become the first boxer to win the heavyweight title three times, but Liston once again knocked him out in the first round. Patterson lasted four seconds longer than in the first bout. The Liston fights were the only times Patterson was actually counted out in his 20-year professional career.

===After the title===
Following these defeats, Patterson went through a depression. However, he eventually recovered and began winning fights again, including top victories over Eddie Machen and George Chuvalo; the Chuvalo match won &quot;The Ring&quot;″s &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; award.

==== Muhammad Ali ====
Patterson was now the number-one challenger for the title held by Muhammad Ali. On November 22, 1965, in Las Vegas, in yet another attempt to be the first to win the world heavyweight title three times, he went into the fight with an injured sacroiliac joint which worsened after the first round and greatly reduced his mobility in a bout in which Ali was clearly dominant. Ali called Patterson an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; for refusing to call him Muhammad Ali (Patterson continued to call him Cassius Clay) and for his outspokenness against black Muslims. Before the match, Patterson had said:

&quot;This fight is a crusade to reclaim the title from the Black Muslims. As a Catholic, I am fighting Clay as a patriotic duty. I am going to return the crown to America.&quot;

Ali hit Patterson repeatedly with jabs from the second round until the referee stopped the fight in the 12th round. In the post-fight interview, Ali praised Patterson for being able to take punches and said Patterson&#x27;s age counted against him.

==== End of career ====
Patterson remained a legitimate contender. In 1966 he traveled to England and knocked out British boxer Henry Cooper in the fourth round at Wembley Stadium.
When Ali was stripped of his title for refusing induction into the military, the World Boxing Association staged an eight-man tournament to determine his successor. Patterson fought Jerry Quarry to a draw in 1967. In a rematch four months later, Patterson lost a controversial 12-round decision to Quarry. Subsequently, in a final attempt at winning the title a third time, Patterson lost a controversial 15-round referee&#x27;s decision to Jimmy Ellis in Stockholm, in 1968, despite breaking Ellis&#x27;s nose and scoring a disputed knockdown.

In September 1969 he divorced his first wife, Sandra Hicks Patterson, who wanted him to quit boxing, while he still had hopes for another title shot.

Patterson continued on, defeating Oscar Bonavena in a close fight over ten rounds in early 1972.

At age 37, Patterson was stopped after seven rounds with a cut eye while still competitive in a rematch with Muhammad Ali for the NABF heavyweight title on September 20, 1972. The defeat proved to be Patterson&#x27;s last fight, although there was never an announcement of retirement.

==Retired life==
In retirement, he and Ingemar Johansson became good friends who flew across the Atlantic to visit each other every year and he served two terms as chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission. He was also inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.

Patterson lived in New Paltz, New York, for many years with his second wife, Janet Seaquist. They had two daughters, Jennifer and Janene. In 1982 and 1983 he ran the Stockholm Marathon together with Ingemar Johansson. He completed the 1983 New York City Marathon in 3:35:27.

His adopted son, Tracy Harris Patterson, was a world champion boxer in the 1990s and was trained by Floyd during part of his career. They are the first father and son to win world titles in boxing. Floyd also trained Canadian heavyweight Donovan &quot;Razor&quot; Ruddock in 1992 for his fights with Greg Page, Phil Jackson, and Lennox Lewis.

The New Paltz High School football field was named &quot;Floyd Patterson Field&quot; in 1985.

==Death==
Patterson suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (which although not known then, was probably related with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is related with many combat and contact sports participants) and prostate cancer in his final years. He died at home in New Paltz, on May 11, 2006, at the age of 71. His body was buried at New Paltz Rural Cemetery in New Paltz, Ulster County, New York.

==Quotes==
* &quot;It&#x27;s easy to do anything in victory. It&#x27;s in defeat that a man reveals himself.&quot;
* &quot;They said I was the fighter who got knocked down the most, but I also got up the most.&quot; (This quote was used in the tenth episode of the 2009 TV series &quot;V&quot;.)
* &quot;When you have millions of dollars, you have millions of friends.&quot;
* On boxing: &quot;It&#x27;s like being in love with a woman. She can be unfaithful, she can be mean, she can be cruel, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. If you love her, you want her, even though she can do you all kinds of harm. It&#x27;s the same with me and boxing. It can do me all kinds of harm but I love it.&quot;

<text>William Hazlitt (10 April 177818 September 1830) was an English essayist, drama and literary critic, painter, social commentator, and philosopher. He is now considered one of the greatest critics and essayists in the history of the English language, placed in the company of Samuel Johnson and George Orwell. He is also acknowledged as the finest art critic of his age. Despite his high standing among historians of literature and art, his work is currently little read and mostly out of print.

During his lifetime he befriended many people who are now part of the 19th-century literary canon, including Charles and Mary Lamb, Stendhal, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, and John Keats.

==Life and works==
===Background===
The family of Hazlitt&#x27;s father were Irish Protestants who moved from the county of Antrim to Tipperary in the early 18th century. Also named William Hazlitt, Hazlitt&#x27;s father attended the University of Glasgow (where he was taught by Adam Smith), receiving a master&#x27;s degree in 1760. Not entirely satisfied with his Presbyterian faith, he became a Unitarian minister in England. In 1764, he became pastor at Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, where in 1766 he married Grace Loftus, daughter of a recently deceased ironmonger. Of their many children, only three survived infancy. The first of these, John (later known as a portrait painter), was born in 1767 at Marshfield in Gloucestershire, where the Reverend William Hazlitt had accepted a new pastorate after his marriage. In 1770, the elder Hazlitt accepted yet another position and moved with his family to Maidstone, Kent, where his first and only surviving daughter, Margaret (usually known as &quot;Peggy&quot;), was born that same year.

===Childhood, education, young philosopher (1778–1797)===
====Childhood====
William, the youngest of the surviving Hazlitt children, was born in Mitre Lane, Maidstone, in 1778. In 1780, when he was two, his family began a nomadic lifestyle that was to last several years. From Maidstone his father took them to Bandon, County Cork, Ireland; and from Bandon in 1783 to the United States, where the elder Hazlitt preached, lectured, and sought a ministerial call to a liberal congregation. His efforts to obtain a post did not meet with success, although he did exert a certain influence on the founding of the first Unitarian church in Boston. In 1786–87, the family returned to England and settled in Wem, in Shropshire. Hazlitt would remember little of his years in America, save the taste of barberries.

====Education====
Hazlitt was educated at home and at a local school. At age 13 he had the satisfaction of seeing his writing appear in print for the first time, when the &quot;Shrewsbury Chronicle&quot; published his letter (July 1791) condemning the riots in Birmingham over Joseph Priestley&#x27;s support for the French Revolution. In 1793, his father sent him to a Unitarian seminary on what was then the outskirts of London, the New College at Hackney (commonly referred to as Hackney College). The schooling he received there, though relatively brief, approximately two years, made a deep and abiding impression on Hazlitt.

The curriculum at Hackney was very broad, including a grounding in the Greek and Latin classics, mathematics, history, government, science, and, of course, religion. Much of his education there was along traditional lines; however, the tutelage having been strongly influenced by eminent Dissenting thinkers of the day like Richard Price and Joseph Priestley, there was also much that was nonconformist. Priestley, whom Hazlitt had read and who was also one of his teachers, was an impassioned commentator on political issues of the day. This, along with the turmoil in the wake of the French Revolution, sparked in Hazlitt and his classmates lively debates on these issues, as they saw their world being transformed around them.

Changes were taking place within the young Hazlitt as well. While, out of respect for his father, Hazlitt never openly broke with his religion, he suffered a loss of faith, and left Hackney before completing his preparation for the ministry.

Although Hazlitt rejected the Unitarian theology, his time at Hackney left him with much more than religious scepticism. He had read widely and formed habits of independent thought and respect for the truth that would remain with him for life. He had thoroughly absorbed a belief in liberty and the rights of man, and confidence in the idea that the mind was an active force which, by disseminating knowledge in both the sciences and the arts, could reinforce the natural tendency in humanity towards good. The school had impressed upon him the importance of the individual&#x27;s ability, working both alone and within a mutually supportive community, to effect beneficial change by adhering to strongly held principles. The belief of many Unitarian thinkers in the natural disinterestedness of the human mind had also laid a foundation for the young Hazlitt&#x27;s own philosophical explorations along those lines. And, though harsh experience and disillusionment later compelled him to qualify some of his early ideas about human nature, he was left with a hatred of tyranny and persecution that he retained to his dying days, as expressed a quarter-century afterward in the retrospective summing up of his political stance in his 1819 collection of &quot;Political Essays&quot;: &quot;I have a hatred of tyranny, and a contempt for its tools ... I cannot sit quietly down under the claims of barefaced power, and I have tried to expose the little arts of sophistry by which they are defended.&quot;

====Young philosopher====
Returning home, around 1795, his thoughts were directed into more secular channels, encompassing not only politics but, increasingly, modern philosophy, which he had begun to read with fascination at Hackney. In September 1794, he had met William Godwin, the reformist thinker whose recently published &quot;Political Justice&quot; had taken English intellectual circles by storm. Hazlitt was never to feel entirely in sympathy with Godwin&#x27;s philosophy, but it gave him much food for thought. He spent much of his time at home in an intensive study of English, Scottish, and Irish thinkers like John Locke, David Hartley, George Berkeley, and David Hume, together with French thinkers like Claude Adrien Helvétius, Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, the Marquis de Condorcet, and Baron d&#x27;Holbach. From this point onwards, Hazlitt&#x27;s goal was to become a philosopher. His intense studies focused on man as a social and political animal and, in particular, on the philosophy of mind, a discipline that would later be called psychology.

It was in this period also that he came across Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who became one of the most important influences on the budding philosopher&#x27;s thinking. He also familiarized himself with the works of Edmund Burke, whose writing style impressed him enormously. Hazlitt then set about working out a treatise, in painstaking detail, on the &quot;natural disinterestedness of the human mind&quot;. It was Hazlitt&#x27;s intention to disprove the notion that man is naturally selfish (benevolent actions being rationally modified selfishness, ideally made habitual), a premise fundamental to much of the moral philosophy of Hazlitt&#x27;s day. The treatise was finally published only in 1805. In the meantime the scope of his reading had broadened and new circumstances had altered the course of his career. Yet, to the end of his life, he would consider himself a philosopher.

Around 1796, Hazlitt found new inspiration and encouragement from Joseph Fawcett, a retired clergyman and prominent reformer, whose enormous breadth of taste left the young thinker awestruck. From Fawcett, in the words of biographer Ralph Wardle, he imbibed a love for &quot;good fiction and impassioned writing&quot;, Fawcett being &quot;a man of keen intelligence who did not scorn the products of the imagination or apologize for his tastes&quot;. With him, Hazlitt not only discussed the radical thinkers of their day, but ranged comprehensively over all kinds of literature, from John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. This background is important for understanding the breadth and depth of Hazlitt&#x27;s own taste in his later critical writings.

Aside from residing with his father as he strove to find his own voice and work out his philosophical ideas, Hazlitt also stayed over with his older brother John, who had studied under Joshua Reynolds and was following a career as a portrait painter. He also spent evenings with delight in London&#x27;s theatrical world, an aesthetic experience that would prove, somewhat later, of seminal importance to his mature critical work. In large part, however, Hazlitt was then living a decidedly contemplative existence, one somewhat frustrated by his failure to express on paper the thoughts and feelings that were churning within him. It was at this juncture that Hazlitt met Samuel Taylor Coleridge. This encounter, a life-changing event, was subsequently to exercise a profound influence on his writing career that, in retrospect, Hazlitt regarded as greater than any other.

===Poetry, painting, and marriage (1798–1812)===
====&quot;First Acquaintance with Poets&quot;====
On 14 January 1798, Hazlitt, in what was to prove a turning point in his life, encountered Coleridge as the latter preached at the Unitarian chapel in Shrewsbury. A minister at the time, Coleridge had as yet none of the fame that would later accrue to him as a poet, critic, and philosopher. Hazlitt, like Thomas de Quincey and many others afterwards, was swept off his feet by Coleridge&#x27;s dazzlingly erudite eloquence. &quot;I could not have been more delighted if I had heard the music of the spheres&quot;, he wrote years later in his essay &quot;My First Acquaintance with Poets&quot;. It was, he added, as if &quot;Poetry and Philosophy had met together. Truth and Genius had embraced, under the eye and with the sanction of Religion.&quot; Long after they had parted ways, Hazlitt would speak of Coleridge as &quot;the only person I ever knew who answered to the idea of a man of genius&quot;. That Hazlitt learned to express his thoughts &quot;in motley imagery or quaint allusion&quot;, that his understanding &quot;ever found a language to express itself,&quot; was, he openly acknowledged, something he owed to Coleridge. For his part, Coleridge showed an interest in the younger man&#x27;s germinating philosophical ideas, and offered encouragement.

In April, Hazlitt jumped at Coleridge&#x27;s invitation to visit him at his residence in Nether Stowey, and that same day was taken to call in on William Wordsworth at his house in Alfoxton. Again, Hazlitt was enraptured. While he was not immediately struck by Wordsworth&#x27;s appearance, in observing the cast of Wordsworth&#x27;s eyes as they contemplated a sunset, he reflected, &quot;With what eyes these poets see nature!&quot; Given the opportunity to read the &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; in manuscript, Hazlitt saw that Wordsworth had the mind of a true poet, and &quot;the sense of a new style and a new spirit in poetry came over me.&quot;

All three were fired by the ideals of liberty and the rights of man. Rambling across the countryside, they talked of poetry, philosophy, and the political movements that were shaking up the old order. This unity of spirit was not to last: Hazlitt himself would recall disagreeing with Wordsworth on the philosophical underpinnings of his projected poem &quot;The Recluse&quot;, just as he had earlier been amazed that Coleridge could dismiss David Hume, regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of that century, as a charlatan. Nonetheless, the experience impressed on the young Hazlitt, at 20, the sense that not only philosophy, to which he had devoted himself, but also poetry warranted appreciation for what it could teach, and the three-week visit stimulated him to pursue his own thinking and writing. Coleridge, on his part, using an archery metaphor, later revealed that he had been highly impressed by Hazlitt&#x27;s promise as a thinker: &quot;He sends well-headed and well-feathered Thoughts straight forwards to the mark with a Twang of the Bow-string.&quot;

====Itinerant painter====
Meanwhile, the fact remained that Hazlitt had chosen not to follow a pastoral vocation. Although he never abandoned his goal of writing a philosophical treatise on the disinterestedness of the human mind, it had to be put aside indefinitely. Still dependent on his father, he was now obliged to earn his own living. Artistic talent seemed to run in the family on his mother&#x27;s side and, starting in 1798, he became increasingly fascinated by painting. His brother, John, had by now become a successful painter of miniature portraits. So it occurred to William that he might earn a living similarly, and he began to take lessons from John.

Hazlitt also visited various picture galleries, and he began to get work doing portraits, painting somewhat in the style of Rembrandt. In this fashion, he managed to make something of a living for a time, travelling back and forth between London and the country, wherever he could get work. By 1802, his work was considered good enough that a portrait he had recently painted of his father was accepted for exhibition by the Royal Academy.

Later in 1802, Hazlitt was commissioned to travel to Paris and copy several works of the Old Masters hanging in The Louvre. This was one of the great opportunities of his life. Over a period of three months, he spent long hours rapturously studying the gallery&#x27;s collections, and hard thinking and close analysis would later inform a considerable body of his art criticism. He also happened to catch sight of Napoleon, a man he idolised as the rescuer of the common man from the oppression of royal &quot;Legitimacy&quot;.

Back in England, Hazlitt again travelled up into the country, having obtained several commissions to paint portraits. One commission again proved fortunate, as it brought him back in touch with Coleridge and Wordsworth, both of whose portraits he painted, as well as one of Coleridge&#x27;s son Hartley. Hazlitt aimed to create the best pictures he could, whether they flattered their subjects or not, and neither poet was satisfied with his result, though Wordsworth and their mutual friend Robert Southey considered his portrait of Coleridge a better likeness than one by the celebrated James Northcote.

Recourse to prostitutes was unexceptional among literary—and other—men of that period, and if Hazlitt was to differ from his contemporaries, the difference lay in his unabashed candour about such arrangements. Personally, he was rarely comfortable in middle- and upper-class female society, and, tormented by desires he later branded as &quot;a perpetual clog and dead-weight upon the reason,&quot; he made an overture to a local woman while visiting the Lake District with Coleridge. He had however grossly misread her intentions and an altercation broke out which led to his precipitous retreat from the town under cover of darkness. This public blunder placed a further strain on his relations with both Coleridge and Wordsworth, which were already fraying for other reasons.

====Marriage, family, and friends====
On 22 March 1803, at a London dinner party held by William Godwin, Hazlitt met Charles Lamb and his sister Mary. A mutual sympathy sprang up immediately between William and Charles, and they became fast friends. Their friendship, though sometimes strained by Hazlitt&#x27;s difficult ways, lasted until the end of Hazlitt&#x27;s life. He was fond of Mary as well, and—ironically in view of her intermittent fits of insanity—he considered her the most reasonable woman he had ever met, no small compliment coming from a man whose view of women at times took a misogynistic turn. Hazlitt frequented the society of the Lambs for the next several years, from 1806 often attending their famous &quot;Wednesdays&quot; and later &quot;Thursdays&quot; literary salons.

With few commissions for painting, Hazlitt seized the opportunity to ready for publication his philosophical treatise, which, according to his son, he had completed by 1803. Godwin intervened to help him find a publisher, and the work, &quot;An Essay on the Principles of Human Action: Being an Argument in favour of the Natural Disinterestedness of the Human Mind&quot;, was printed in a limited edition of 250 copies by Joseph Johnson on 19 July 1805. This gained him little notice as an original thinker, and no money. Although the treatise he valued above anything else he wrote was never, at least in his own lifetime, recognised for what he believed was its true worth, it brought him attention as one who had a grasp of contemporary philosophy. He therefore was commissioned to abridge and write a preface to a now obscure work of mental philosophy, &quot;The Light of Nature Pursued&quot; by Abraham Tucker (originally published in seven volumes from 1765 to 1777), which appeared in 1807 and may have had some influence on his own later thinking.

Slowly Hazlitt began to find enough work to eke out a bare living. His outrage at events then taking place in English politics in reaction to Napoleon&#x27;s wars led to his writing and publishing, at his own expense (though he had almost no money), a political pamphlet, &quot;Free Thoughts on Public Affairs&quot; (1806), an attempt to mediate between private economic interests and a national application of the thesis of his &quot;Essay&quot; that human motivation is not, inherently, entirely selfish.

Hazlitt also contributed three letters to William Cobbett&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Political Register&quot; at this time, all scathing critiques of Thomas Malthus&#x27;s &quot;Essay on the Principle of Population&quot; (1798 and later editions). Here he replaced the dense, abstruse manner of his philosophical work with the trenchant prose style that was to be the hallmark of his later essays. Hazlitt&#x27;s philippic, dismissing Malthus&#x27;s argument on population limits as sycophantic rhetoric to flatter the rich, since large swathes of uncultivated land lay all round England, has been hailed as &quot;the most substantial, comprehensive, and brilliant of the Romantic ripostes to Malthus&quot;. Also in 1807, Hazlitt undertook a compilation of parliamentary speeches, published that year as &quot;The Eloquence of the British Senate&quot;. In the prefaces to the speeches, he began to show a skill he would later develop to perfection, the art of the pithy character sketch. He was able to find more work as a portrait painter as well.

In May 1808, Hazlitt married Sarah Stoddart, a friend of Mary Lamb and sister of John Stoddart, a journalist who became editor of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in 1814. Shortly before the wedding, John Stoddart established a trust into which he began paying £100 per year, for the benefit of Hazlitt and his wife—this was a very generous gesture, but Hazlitt detested being supported by his brother-in-law, whose political beliefs he despised. This union was not a , and incompatibilities would later drive the couple apart; yet, for a while, it seemed to work well enough, and their initial behavior was both playful and affectionate. Miss Stoddart, an unconventional woman, accepted Hazlitt and tolerated his eccentricities just as he, with his own somewhat offbeat individualism, accepted her. Together they made an agreeable social foursome with the Lambs, who visited them when they set up a household in Winterslow, a village a few miles from Salisbury, Wiltshire, in southern England. The couple had three sons over the next few years, Only one of their children, William, born in 1811, survived infancy. (He in turn fathered William Carew Hazlitt.)

As the head of a family, Hazlitt was now more than ever in need of money. Through William Godwin, with whom he was frequently in touch, he obtained a commission to write an English grammar, published on 11 November 1809 as &quot;A New and Improved Grammar of the English Tongue&quot;. Another project that came his way was the work that was published as &quot;Memoirs of the Late Thomas Holcroft&quot;, a compilation of autobiographical writing by the recently deceased playwright, novelist, and radical political activist, together with additional material by Hazlitt himself. Though completed in 1810, this work did not see the light of day until 1816, and so provided no financial gain to satisfy the needs of a young husband and father. Hazlitt in the meantime had not forsaken his painterly ambitions. His environs at Winterslow afforded him opportunities for landscape painting, and he spent considerable time in London procuring commissions for portraits.

In January 1812 Hazlitt embarked on a sometime career as a lecturer, in this first instance by delivering a series of talks on the British philosophers at the Russell Institution in London. A central thesis of the talks was that Thomas Hobbes, rather than John Locke, had laid the foundations of modern philosophy. After a shaky beginning, Hazlitt attracted some attention—and some much-needed money—by these lectures, and they provided him with an opportunity to expound some of his own ideas.

The year 1812 seems to have been the last in which Hazlitt persisted seriously in his ambition to make a career as a painter. Although he had demonstrated some talent, the results of his most impassioned efforts always fell far short of the very standards he had set by comparing his own work with the productions of such masters as Rembrandt, Titian, and Raphael. It did not help that, when painting commissioned portraits, he refused to sacrifice his artistic integrity to the temptation to flatter his subjects for remunerative gain. The results, not infrequently, failed to please their subjects, and he consequently failed to build a clientele.

But other opportunities awaited him.

===Journalist, essayist, and &quot;Liber Amoris&quot; (1812–1823)===
====Journalist====
In October 1812, Hazlitt was hired by &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; as a parliamentary reporter. Soon he met John Hunt, publisher of &quot;The Examiner&quot;, and his younger brother Leigh Hunt, the poet and essayist, who edited the weekly paper. Hazlitt admired both as champions of liberty, and befriended especially the younger Hunt, who found work for him. He began to contribute miscellaneous essays to &quot;The Examiner&quot; in 1813, and the scope of his work for the &quot;Chronicle&quot; was expanded to include drama criticism, literary criticism, and political essays. In 1814, &quot;The Champion&quot; was added to the list of periodicals that accepted Hazlitt&#x27;s by-now profuse output of literary and political criticism. A critique of Joshua Reynolds&#x27; theories about art appeared there as well, one of Hazlitt&#x27;s major forays into art criticism.

Having by 1814 become established as a journalist, Hazlitt had begun to earn a satisfactory living. A year earlier, with the prospect of a steady income, he had moved his family to a house at 19 York Street, Westminster, which had been occupied by the poet John Milton, whom Hazlitt admired above all English poets except Shakespeare. As it happened, Hazlitt&#x27;s landlord was the philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham. Hazlitt was to write extensively about both Milton and Bentham over the next few years.

His circle of friends expanded, though he never seems to have been particularly close with any but the Lambs and to an extent Leigh Hunt and the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon. His low tolerance for any who, he thought, had abandoned the cause of liberty, along with his frequent outspokenness, even tactlessness, in social situations made it difficult for many to feel close to him, and at times he tried the patience of even Charles Lamb. In &quot;The Examiner&quot; in late 1814, Hazlitt was the first to provide a critique of Wordsworth&#x27;s poem &quot;The Excursion&quot; (Hazlitt&#x27;s review appeared weeks before Francis Jeffrey&#x27;s notorious dismissal of the poem with the words &quot;This will never do&quot;). He lavished extreme praise on the poet—and equally extreme censure. While praising the poem&#x27;s sublimity and intellectual power, he took to task the intrusive egotism of its author. Clothing landscape and incident with the poet&#x27;s personal thoughts and feelings suited this new sort of poetry very well; but his abstract philosophical musing too often steered the poem into didacticism, a leaden counterweight to its more imaginative flights. Wordsworth, who seems to have been unable to tolerate anything less than unqualified praise, was enraged, and relations between the two became cooler than ever.

Though Hazlitt continued to think of himself as a &quot;metaphysician&quot;, he began to feel comfortable in the role of journalist. His self-esteem received an added boost when he was invited to contribute to the quarterly &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot; (his contributions, beginning in early 1815, were frequent and regular for some years), the most distinguished periodical on the Whig side of the political fence (its rival &quot;The Quarterly Review&quot; occupied the Tory side). Writing for so highly respected a publication was considered a major step up from writing for weekly papers, and Hazlitt was proud of this connection.

On 18 June 1815, Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo. Having idolised Napoleon for years, Hazlitt took it as a personal blow. The event seemed to him to mark the end of hope for the common man against the oppression of &quot;legitimate&quot; monarchy. Profoundly depressed, he took up heavy drinking and was reported to have walked around unshaven and unwashed for weeks. He idolised and spoiled his son, William Jr., but in most respects his household grew increasingly disordered over the following year: his marriage deteriorated, and he spent more and more time away from home. His part-time work as a drama critic provided him with an excuse to spend his evenings at the theatre. Afterwards he would then tarry with those friends who could tolerate his irascibility, the number of whom dwindled as a result of his occasionally outrageous behaviour.

Hazlitt continued to produce articles on miscellaneous topics for &quot;The Examiner&quot; and other periodicals, including political diatribes against any who he felt ignored or minimised the needs and rights of the common man. Defection from the cause of liberty had become easier in light of the oppressive political atmosphere in England at that time, in reaction to the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. The Hunts were his primary allies in opposing this tendency. Lamb, who tried to remain uninvolved politically, tolerated his abrasiveness, and that friendship managed to survive, if only just barely in the face of Hazlitt&#x27;s growing bitterness, short temper, and propensity for hurling invective at friends and foes alike.

For relief from all that weighed on his mind, Hazlitt became a passionate player at a kind of racquet ball similar to the game of Fives (a type of handball of which he was a fan) in that it was played against a wall. He competed with savage intensity, dashing around the court like a madman, drenched in sweat, and was accounted a good player. More than just a distraction from his woes, his devotion to this pastime led to musings on the value of competitive sports and on human skill in general, expressed in writings like his notice of the &quot;Death of John Cavanagh&quot; (a celebrated Fives player) in &quot;The Examiner&quot; on 9 February 1817, and the essay &quot;The Indian Jugglers&quot; in &quot;Table-Talk&quot; (1821).

Early in 1817, forty of Hazlitt&#x27;s essays that had appeared in &quot;The Examiner&quot; in a regular column called &quot;The Round Table&quot;, along with a dozen pieces by Leigh Hunt in the same series, was collected in book form. Hazlitt&#x27;s contributions to &quot;The Round Table&quot; were written somewhat in the manner of the periodical essays of the day, a genre defined by such eighteenth-century magazines as &quot;The Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

The far-ranging eclectic variety of the topics treated would typify his output in succeeding years: Shakespeare (&quot;On the Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;), Milton (&quot;On Milton&#x27;s Lycidas&quot;), art criticism (&quot;On Hogarth&#x27;s Marriage a-la-mode&quot;), aesthetics (&quot;On Beauty&quot;), drama criticism (&quot;On Mr. Kean&#x27;s Iago&quot;; Hazlitt was the first critic to champion the acting talent of Edmund Kean), social criticism (&quot;On the Tendency of Sects&quot;, &quot;On the Causes of Methodism&quot;, &quot;On Different Sorts of Fame&quot;).

There was an article on &quot;The Tatler&quot; itself. Mostly his political commentary was reserved for other vehicles, but included was a &quot;Character of the Late Mr. Pitt&quot;, a scathing characterisation of the recently deceased former Prime Minister. Written in 1806, Hazlitt liked it well enough to have already had it printed twice before (and it would appear again in a collection of political essays in 1819).

Some essays blend Hazlitt&#x27;s social and psychological observations in a calculatedly thought-provoking way, presenting to the reader the &quot;paradoxes&quot; of human nature. The first of the collected essays, &quot;On the Love of Life&quot;, explains, &quot;It is our intention, in the course of these papers, occasionally to expose certain vulgar errors, which have crept into our reasonings on men and manners... The love of life is ... in general, the effect not of our enjoyments, but of our passions&quot;.

Again, in &quot;On Pedantry&quot;, Hazlitt declares that &quot;The power of attaching an interest to the most trifling or painful pursuits ... is one of the greatest happinesses of our nature&quot;. In &quot;On Different Sorts of Fame&quot;, &quot;In proportion as men can command the immediate and vulgar applause of others, they become indifferent to that which is remote and difficult of attainment&quot;. And in &quot;On Good-Nature&quot;, &quot;Good nature, or what is often considered as such, is the most selfish of all the virtues...&quot;

Many of the components of Hazlitt&#x27;s style begin to take shape in these &quot;Round Table&quot; essays. Some of his &quot;paradoxes&quot; are so hyperbolic as to shock when encountered out of context: &quot;All country people hate each other&quot;, for example, from the second part of &quot;On Mr. Wordsworth&#x27;s Excursion&quot;. He interweaves quotations from literature old and new, helping drive his points home with concentrated allusiveness and wielded extraordinarily efficiently as a critical instrument. Yet, although his use of quotations is (as many critics have felt) as fine as any author&#x27;s has ever been, all too often he gets the quotes wrong. In one of his essays on Wordsworth he misquotes Wordsworth himself:

:Though nothing can bring back the hour
:Of glory in the grass, of splendour in the flower...
:(See .)

Though Hazlitt was still following the model of the older periodical essayists, these quirks, together with his keen social and psychological insights, began here to coalesce into a style very much his own.

====Success—and trouble====
In the meantime, Hazlitt&#x27;s marriage continued its downward spiral; he was writing furiously for several periodicals to make ends meet; waiting so far in vain for the collection &quot;The Round Table&quot; to be issued as a book (which it finally was in February 1817); suffering bouts of illness; and making enemies by his venomous political diatribes. He found relief by a change of course, shifting the focus of his analysis from the acting of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays to the substance of the works themselves. The result was a collection of critical essays entitled &quot;Characters of Shakespear&#x27;s Plays&quot; (1817).

His approach was something new. There had been criticisms of Shakespeare before, but either they were not comprehensive or they were not aimed at the general reading public. As Ralph Wardle put it, before Hazlitt wrote this book, &quot;no one had ever attempted a comprehensive study of all of Shakespeare, play by play, that readers could read and reread with pleasure as a guide to their understanding and appreciation&quot;. Somewhat loosely organised, and even rambling, the studies offer personal appreciations of the plays that are unashamedly enthusiastic. Hazlitt does not present a measured account of the plays&#x27; strengths and weaknesses, as did Dr. Johnson, or view them in terms of a &quot;mystical&quot; theory, as Hazlitt thought his contemporary A.W. Schlegel did (though he approves of many of Schlegel&#x27;s judgements and quotes him liberally). Without apology, he addresses his readers as fellow lovers of Shakespeare and shares with them the beauties of what he thought the finest passages of the plays he liked best.

Readers took to it, the first edition selling out in six weeks. It received favourable reviews as well, not only by Leigh Hunt, whose bias as a close friend might be questioned, but also by Francis Jeffrey, the editor of &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot;, a notice that Hazlitt greatly appreciated. Though he contributed to that quarterly, and corresponded with its editor on business, he had never met Jeffrey, and the two were in no sense personal friends. For Jeffrey, the book was not so much a learned study of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays as much as a loving and eloquent appreciation, full of insight, which displayed &quot;considerable originality and genius&quot;.

This critical and popular acclaim offered Hazlitt the prospect of getting out of debt, and allowed him to relax and bask in the light of his growing fame. In literary circles however, his reputation had been tarnished in the meantime: he had openly taken both Wordsworth and Coleridge to task on personal grounds and for failing to fulfill the promise of their earlier accomplishments, and both were apparently responsible for retaliatory rumours which seriously damaged Hazlitt&#x27;s repute. And the worst was yet to come.

Nonetheless Hazlitt&#x27;s satisfaction at the relief he gained from his financial woes was supplemented by the positive response his return to the lecture hall received. In early 1818 he delivered a series of talks on &quot;the English Poets&quot;, from Chaucer to his own time. Though somewhat uneven in quality, his lectures were ultimately judged a success. In making arrangements for the lectures, he had met Peter George Patmore, Assistant Secretary of the Surrey Institution where the lectures were presented. Patmore soon became a friend as well as Hazlitt&#x27;s confidant in the most troubled period of the latter&#x27;s life.

The Surrey Institution lectures were printed in book form, followed by a collection of his drama criticism, &quot;A View of the English Stage&quot;, and the second edition of &quot;Characters of Shakespear&#x27;s Plays&quot;. Hazlitt&#x27;s career as a lecturer gained some momentum, and his growing popularity allowed him to get a collection of his political writings published as well, &quot;Political Essays, with Sketches of Public Characters&quot;. Lectures on &quot;the English Comic Writers&quot; soon followed, and these as well were published in book form. He then delivered lectures on dramatists contemporary with Shakespeare, which were published as &quot;Lectures on the Dramatic Literature of the Age of Elizabeth&quot;. This series of talks did not receive the public acclaim that his earlier lectures had, but were reviewed enthusiastically after they were published.

More trouble was brewing, however. Hazlitt was attacked brutally in &quot;The Quarterly Review&quot; and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, both Tory publications. One &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; article mocked him as &quot;pimpled Hazlitt&quot;, accused him of ignorance, dishonesty, and obscenity, and incorporated vague physical threats. Though Hazlitt was rattled by these attacks, he sought legal advice and sued. The lawsuit against &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; was finally settled out of court in his favour. Yet the attacks did not entirely cease. The &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; issued a review of Hazlitt&#x27;s published lectures in which he was condemned as ignorant and his writing as unintelligible. Such partisan onslaughts brought spirited responses. One, unlike an earlier response to the &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; attack that never saw the light of day, was published, as &quot;A Letter to William Gifford, Esq.&quot; (1819; Gifford was the editor of the &quot;Quarterly&quot;). The pamphlet, notable also for deploying the term ultracrepidarian, which Hazlitt himself may have coined, amounts to an &quot;apologia&quot; for his life and work thus far and showed he was well able to defend himself. Yet Hazlitt&#x27;s attackers had done their damage. Not only was he personally shaken, he found it more difficult to have his works published, and once more he had to struggle for a living.

====Solitude and infatuation====
His lecturing in particular had drawn to Hazlitt a small group of admirers. Best known today is the poet John Keats, who not only attended the lectures but became Hazlitt&#x27;s friend in this period. The two met in November 1816 through their mutual friend, the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon, and were last seen together in May 1820 at a dinner given by Haydon. In those few years before the poet&#x27;s untimely death, the two read and admired each other&#x27;s work, and Keats, as a younger man seeking guidance, solicited Hazlitt&#x27;s advice on a course of reading and direction in his career. Some of Keats&#x27;s writing, particularly his key idea of &quot;negative capability&quot;, was influenced by the concept of &quot;disinterested sympathy&quot; he discovered in Hazlitt, whose work the poet devoured. Hazlitt, on his part, later wrote that of all the younger generation of poets, Keats showed the most promise, and he became Keats&#x27;s first anthologist when he included several of Keats&#x27;s poems in a collection of British poetry he compiled in 1824, three years after Keats&#x27;s death.

Less well known today than Keats were others who loyally attended his lectures and constituted a small circle of admirers, such as the diarist and chronicler Henry Crabb Robinson and the novelist Mary Russell Mitford. But the rumours that had been spread demonising Hazlitt, along with the vilifications of the Tory press, not only hurt his pride but seriously obstructed his ability to earn a living. Income from his lectures had also proved insufficient to keep him afloat.

His thoughts drifted to gloom and misanthropy. His mood was not improved by the fact that by now there was no pretence of keeping up appearances: his marriage had failed. Years earlier he had grown resigned to the lack of love between him and Sarah. He had been visiting prostitutes and displayed more idealised amorous inclinations toward a number of women whose names are lost to history. Now in 1819, he was unable to pay the rent on their rooms at 19 York Street and his family were evicted. That was the last straw for Sarah, who moved into rooms with their son and broke with Hazlitt for good, forcing him to find his own accommodation. He would sometimes see his son and even his wife, with whom he remained on speaking terms, but they were effectively separated.

At this time Hazlitt would frequently retreat for long periods to the countryside he had grown to love since his marriage, staying at the &quot;Winterslow Hut&quot;, a coaching inn at Winterslow, near a property his wife owned. This was both for solace and to concentrate on his writing. He explained his motivation as one of not wanting to withdraw completely but rather to become an invisible observer of society, &quot;to become a silent spectator of the mighty scene of things ... to take a thoughtful, anxious interest in what is passing in the world, but not to feel the slightest inclination to make or meddle with it.&quot; Thus, for days on end, he would shut himself away and write for periodicals, including the recently re-established (1820) &quot;London Magazine&quot;, to which he contributed drama criticism and miscellaneous essays.
One idea that particularly bore fruit was that of a series of articles called &quot;Table-Talk&quot;. (Many were written expressly for inclusion in the book of the same title, &quot;Table-Talk; or, Original Essays&quot;, which appeared in different editions and forms over the next few years.) These essays, structured in the loose manner of table talk, were written in the &quot;familiar style&quot; of the sort devised two centuries earlier by Montaigne, whom Hazlitt greatly admired. The personal &quot;I&quot; was now substituted for the editorial &quot;we&quot; in a careful remodulation of style that carried the spirit of these essays far from that of the typical eighteenth-century periodical essay, to which he had more closely adhered in &quot;The Round Table&quot;. In a preface to a later edition of &quot;Table-Talk&quot;, Hazlitt explained that in these essays he eschewed scholarly precision in favour of a combination of the &quot;literary and the conversational&quot;. As in conversation among friends, the discussion would often branch off into topics related only in a general way to the main theme, &quot;but which often threw a curious and striking light upon it, or upon human life in general&quot;.

In these essays, many of which have been acclaimed as among the finest in the language, Hazlitt weaves personal material into more general reflections on life, frequently bringing in long recollections of happy days of his years as an apprentice painter (as in &quot;On the Pleasure of Painting&quot;, written in December 1820) as well as other pleasurable recollections of earlier years, &quot;hours ... sacred to silence and to musing, to be treasured up in the memory, and to feed the source of smiling thoughts thereafter&quot; (&quot;On Going a Journey&quot;, written January 1822).

Hazlitt also had to spend time in London in these years. In another violent contrast, a London lodging house was the stage on which the worst crisis of his life was to play itself out.

In August 1820, a month after his father&#x27;s death at the age of 83, he rented a couple of rooms in 9 Southampton Buildings in London from a tailor named Micaiah Walker. Walker&#x27;s 19-year-old daughter Sarah, who helped with the housekeeping, would bring the new lodger his breakfast. Immediately, Hazlitt became infatuated with Miss Walker, more than 22 years his junior. (Before much longer, this &quot;infatuation&quot; turned into a protracted obsession.) His brief conversations with Walker cheered him and alleviated the loneliness that he felt from his failed marriage and the recent death of his father. He dreamed of marrying her, but that would require a divorce from Sarah Hazlitt—no easy matter. Finally, his wife agreed to grant him a Scottish divorce, which would allow him to remarry (as he could not had he been divorced in England).

Sarah Walker was, as some of Hazlitt&#x27;s friends could see, a fairly ordinary girl. She had aspirations to better herself, and a famous author seemed like a prize catch, but she never really understood Hazlitt. When another lodger named Tomkins came along, she entered into a romantic entanglement with him as well, leading each of her suitors to believe he was the sole object of her affection. With vague words, she evaded absolute commitment until she could decide which she liked better or was the more advantageous catch.

Hazlitt discovered the truth about Tomkins, and from then on his jealousy and suspicions of Sarah Walker&#x27;s real character afforded him little rest. For months, during the preparations for the divorce and as he tried to earn a living, he alternated between rage and despair, on the one hand, and the comforting if unrealistic thought that she was really &quot;a good girl&quot; and would accept him at last. The divorce was finalised on 17 July 1822, and Hazlitt returned to London to see his beloved—only to find her cold and resistant. They then become involved in angry altercations of jealousy and recrimination. And it was over, though Hazlitt could not for some time persuade himself to believe so. His mind nearly snapped. At his emotional nadir, he contemplated suicide.

It was with some difficulty that he eventually recovered his equilibrium. In order to ascertain Sarah&#x27;s true character, he persuaded an acquaintance to take lodgings in the Walkers&#x27; building and attempt to seduce Sarah. Hazlitt&#x27;s friend reported that the attempt seemed to be about to succeed, but she prevented him from taking the ultimate liberty. Her behaviour was as it had been with several other male lodgers, not only Hazlitt, who now concluded that he had been dealing with, rather than an &quot;angel&quot;, an &quot;impudent whore&quot;, an ordinary &quot;lodging house decoy&quot;. Eventually, though Hazlitt could not know this, she had a child by Tomkins and moved in with him.

By pouring out his tale of woe to anyone he happened to meet (including his friends Peter George Patmore and James Sheridan Knowles), he was able to find a cathartic outlet for his misery. But catharsis was also provided by his recording the course of his love in a thinly disguised fictional account, published anonymously in May 1823 as &quot;Liber Amoris; or, The New Pygmalion&quot;. (Enough clues were present so that the identity of the writer did not remain hidden for long.)

Critics have been divided as to the literary merits of &quot;Liber Amoris&quot;, a deeply personal account of frustrated love that is quite unlike anything else Hazlitt ever wrote. Wardle suggests that it was compelling but marred by sickly sentimentality, and also proposes that Hazlitt might even have been anticipating some of the experiments in chronology made by later novelists.

One or two positive reviews appeared, such as the one in the &quot;Globe&quot;, 7 June 1823: &quot;The &quot;Liber Amoris&quot; is unique in the English language; and as, possibly, the first book in its fervour, its vehemency, and its careless exposure of passion and weakness—of sentiments and sensations which the common race of mankind seek most studiously to mystify or conceal—that exhibits a portion of the most distinguishing characteristics of Rousseau, it ought to be generally praised&quot;.

However, such complimentary assessments were the rare exception. Whatever its ultimate merits, &quot;Liber Amoris&quot; provided ample ammunition for Hazlitt&#x27;s detractors, and even some of his closest friends were scandalised. For months he did not even have contact with the Lambs. And the strait-laced Robinson found the book &quot;disgusting&quot;, &quot;nauseous and revolting&quot;, &quot;low and gross and tedious and very offensive&quot;, believing that &quot;it ought to exclude the author from all decent society&quot;. As ever, peace of mind proved elusive for William Hazlitt.

===Return to philosophy, second marriage, and tour of Europe (1823–1825)===

====Philosopher, again====
There were times in this turbulent period when Hazlitt could not focus on his work. But often, as in his self-imposed seclusion at Winterslow, he was able to achieve a &quot;philosophic detachment&quot;, and he continued to turn out essays of remarkable variety and literary merit, most of them making up the two volumes of &quot;Table-Talk&quot;. (A number were saved for later publication in &quot;The Plain Speaker&quot; in 1826, while others remained uncollected.)

Some of these essays were in large part retrospectives on the author&#x27;s own life (&quot;On Reading Old Books&quot; [1821], for example, along with others mentioned above). In others, he invites his readers to join him in gazing at the spectacle of human folly and perversity (&quot;On Will-making&quot; [1821], or &quot;On Great and Little Things&quot; [1821], for example). At times he scrutinises the subtle workings of the individual mind (as in &quot;On Dreams&quot; [1823]); or he invites us to laugh at harmless eccentricities of human nature (&quot;On People with One Idea&quot; [1821]).

Other essays bring into perspective the scope and limitations of the mind, as measured against the vastness of the universe and the extent of human history (&quot;Why Distant Objects Please&quot; [1821/2] and &quot;On Antiquity&quot; [1821] are only two of many). Several others scrutinise the manners and morals of the age (such as &quot;On Vulgarity and Affectation&quot;, &quot;On Patronage and Puffing&quot;, and &quot;On Corporate Bodies&quot; [all 1821]).

Many of these &quot;Table-Talk&quot; essays display Hazlitt&#x27;s interest in genius and artistic creativity. There are specific instances of literary or art criticism (for example &quot;On a Landscape of Nicolas Poussin&quot; [1821] and &quot;On Milton&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; [1822]) but also numerous investigations of the psychology of creativity and genius (&quot;On Genius and Common Sense&quot; [1821], &quot;Whether Genius Is Conscious of Its Powers&quot; [1823], and others). In his manner of exploring an idea by antitheses (for example, &quot;On the Past and the Future&quot; [1821], &quot;On the Picturesque and Ideal&quot; [1821]), he contrasts the utmost achievements of human mechanical skill with the nature of artistic creativity in &quot;The Indian Jugglers&quot; [1821].

Hazlitt&#x27;s fascination with the extremes of human capability in any field led to his writing &quot;The Fight&quot; (published in the February 1822 &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot;). This essay never appeared in the Table-Talk series or anywhere else in the author&#x27;s lifetime. This direct, personal account of a prize fight, commingling refined literary allusions with popular slang, was controversial in its time as depicting too &quot;low&quot; a subject. Written at a dismal time in his life—Hazlitt&#x27;s divorce was pending, and he was far from sure of being able to marry Sarah Walker—the article shows scarcely a trace of his agony. Not quite like any other essay by Hazlitt, it proved to be one of his most popular, was frequently reprinted after his death, and nearly two centuries later was judged to be &quot;one of the most passionately written pieces of prose in the late Romantic period&quot;.

Another article written in this period, &quot;On the Pleasure of Hating&quot; (1823; included in &quot;The Plain Speaker&quot;), is on one level a pure outpouring of spleen, a distillation of all the bitterness of his life to that point. He links his own vitriol, however, to a strain of malignity at the core of human nature:

The pleasure of hating, like a poisonous mineral, eats into the heart of religion, and turns it to rankling spleen and bigotry; it makes patriotism an excuse for carrying fire, pestilence, and famine into other lands: it leaves to virtue nothing but the spirit of censoriousness, and a narrow, jealous, inquisitorial watchfulness over the actions and motives of others.

To one twentieth-century critic, Gregory Dart, this self-diagnosis by Hazlitt of his own misanthropic enmities was the sour and surreptitiously preserved offspring of Jacobinism. Hazlitt concludes his diatribe by refocusing on himself: &quot;...have I not reason to hate and to despise myself? Indeed I do; and chiefly for not having hated and despised the world enough&quot;.

Not only do the &quot;Table-Talk&quot; essays frequently display &quot;trenchant insights into human nature&quot;, they at times reflect on the vehicle of those insights and of the literary and art criticism that constitute some of the essays. &quot;On Criticism&quot; (1821) delves into the history and purposes of criticism itself; and &quot;On Familiar Style&quot; (1821 or 1822) reflexively explores at some length the principles behind its own composition, along with that of other essays of this kind by Hazlitt and some of his contemporaries, like Lamb and Cobbett.

In &quot;Table-Talk&quot;, Hazlitt had found the most congenial format for this thoughts and observations. A broad panorama of the triumphs and follies of humanity, an exploration of the quirks of the mind, of the nobility but more often the meanness and sheer malevolence of human nature, the collection was knit together by a web of self-consistent thinking, a skein of ideas woven from a lifetime of close reasoning on life, art, and literature. He illustrated his points with bright imagery and pointed analogies, among which were woven pithy quotations drawn from the history of English literature, primarily the poets, from Chaucer to his contemporaries Wordsworth, Byron, and Keats. Most often, he quoted his beloved Shakespeare and to a lesser extent Milton. As he explained in &quot;On Familiar Style&quot;, he strove to fit the exact words to the things he wanted to express and often succeeded—in a way that would bring home his meaning to any literate person of some education and intelligence.

These essays were not quite like anything ever done before. They attracted some admiration during Hazlitt&#x27;s lifetime, but it was only long after his death that their reputation achieved full stature, increasingly often considered among the best essays ever written in English. Nearly two centuries after they were written, for example, biographer Stanley Jones deemed Hazlitt&#x27;s &quot;Table-Talk&quot; and &quot;The Plain Speaker&quot; together to constitute &quot;the major work of his life&quot;, and critic David Bromwich called many of these essays &quot;more observing, original, and keen-witted than any others in the language&quot;.

In 1823, Hazlitt also published anonymously &quot;Characteristics: In the Manner of Rochefoucault&#x27;s Maxims&quot;, a collection of aphorisms modelled explicitly, as Hazlitt noted in his preface, on the &quot;Maximes&quot; (1665–1693) of the Duc de La Rochefoucauld. Never quite as cynical as La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s, many, however, reflect his attitude of disillusionment at this stage of his life. Primarily, these 434 maxims took to an extreme his method of arguing by paradoxes and acute contrasts. For example, maxim &quot;CCCCXXVIII&quot;:
There are some persons who never succeed, from being too indolent to undertake anything; and others who regularly fail, because the instant they find success in their power, they grow indifferent, and give over the attempt.
But they also lacked the benefit of Hazlitt&#x27;s extended reasoning and lucid imagery, and were never included among his greatest works.

====Recovery and second marriage====
At the beginning of 1824, though worn out by thwarted passion and the venomous attacks on his character following &quot;Liber Amoris&quot;, Hazlitt was beginning to recover his equilibrium. Pressed for money as always, he continued to write for various periodicals, including &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot;. To &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; he supplied more essays in the &quot;Table-Talk&quot; manner, and he produced some art criticism, published in that year as &quot;Sketches of the Principal Picture Galleries of England&quot;.

He also found relief, finally, from the Sarah Walker imbroglio. In 1823, Hazlitt had met Isabella Bridgwater (&quot;née&quot; Shaw), who married him in March or April 1824, of necessity in Scotland, as Hazlitt&#x27;s divorce was not recognised in England. Little is known about this Scottish-born widow of the Chief Justice of Grenada, or about her interaction with Hazlitt. She may have been attracted to the idea of marrying a well-known author. For Hazlitt, she offered an escape from loneliness and to an extent from financial worries, as she possessed an independent income of £300 per annum. The arrangement seems to have had a strong element of convenience for both of them. Certainly Hazlitt nowhere in his writings suggests that this marriage was the love match he had been seeking, nor does he mention his new wife at all. In fact, after three and half years, tensions likely resulting from (as Stanley Jones put it) Hazlitt&#x27;s &quot;improvidence&quot;, his son&#x27;s dislike of her, and neglect of his wife due to his obsessive absorption in preparing an immense biography of Napoleon, resulted in her abrupt departure, and they never lived together again.

For now, in any case, the union afforded the two of them the opportunity to travel. First, they toured parts of Scotland, then, later in 1824, began a European tour lasting over a year.

====&quot;The Spirit of the Age&quot;====

Before Hazlitt and his new bride set off for the continent, he submitted, among the miscellany of essays that year, one to the &quot;New Monthly&quot; on &quot;Jeremy Bentham&quot;, the first in a series entitled &quot;Spirits of the Age&quot;. Several more of the kind followed over the next few months, at least one in &quot;The Examiner&quot;. Together with some newly written, and one brought in from the &quot;Table-Talk&quot; series, they were collected in book form in 1825 as &quot;The Spirit of the Age: Or, Contemporary Portraits&quot;.

These sketches of twenty-five men, prominent or otherwise notable as characteristic of the age, came easily to Hazlitt. In his days as a political reporter he had observed many of them at close range. Others he knew personally, and for years their philosophy or poetry had been the subject of his thoughts and lectures.

There were philosophers, social reformers, poets, politicians, and a few who did not fall neatly into any of these categories. Bentham, Godwin, and Malthus, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Byron were some of the most prominent writers; Wilberforce and Canning were prominent in the political arena; and a few who were hard to classify, such as The Rev. Edward Irving, the preacher, William Gifford, the satirist and critic, and the recently deceased Horne Tooke, a lawyer, politician, grammarian, and wit.

Many of the sketches presented their subjects as seen in daily life. We witness, for example, Bentham &quot;tak[ing] a turn in his garden&quot; with a guest, espousing his plans for &quot;a code of laws &#x27;for some island in the watery waste&#x27;&quot;, or playing the organ as a relief from incessant musings on vast schemes to improve the lot of mankind. As Bentham&#x27;s neighbour for some years, Hazlitt had had good opportunity to observe the reformer and philosopher at first hand.

He had already devoted years to pondering much of the thinking espoused by several of these figures. Thoroughly immersed in the Malthusian controversy, for example, Hazlitt had published &quot;A Reply to the Essay on Population&quot; as early as 1807, and the essay on Malthus is a distillation of Hazlitt&#x27;s earlier criticisms.

Where he finds it applicable, Hazlitt brings his subjects together in pairs, setting off one against the other, although sometimes his complex comparisons bring out unexpected similarities, as well as differences, between temperaments that otherwise appear to be at opposite poles, as in his reflections on Scott and Byron. So too he points out that, for all the limitations of Godwin&#x27;s reasoning, as given in that essay, Malthus comes off worse: &quot;Nothing...could be more illogical...than the whole of Mr. Malthus&#x27;s reasoning applied as an answer...to Mr. Godwin&#x27;s book&quot;. Most distasteful to Hazlitt was the application of &quot;Mr. Malthus&#x27;s &#x27;gospel&#x27;&quot;, greatly influential at the time. Many in positions of power had used Malthus&#x27;s theory to deny the poor relief in the name of the public good, to prevent their propagating the species beyond the means to support it; while on the rich no restraints whatsoever were imposed.

Yet, softening the asperities of his critique, Hazlitt rounds out his sketch by conceding that &quot;Mr. Malthus&#x27;s style is correct and elegant; his tone of controversy mild and gentlemanly; and the care with which he has brought his facts and documents together, deserves the highest praise&quot;.

His portraits of such Tory politicians as Lord Eldon are unrelenting, as might be expected. But elsewhere his characterisations are more balanced, more even-tempered, than similar accounts in past years. Notably, there are portraits of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey, which are, to an extent, essences of his former thoughts about these poets—and those thoughts had been profuse. He had earlier directed some of his most vitriolic attacks against them for having replaced the humanistic and revolutionary ideas of their earlier years with staunch support of the Establishment. Now he goes out of his way to qualify his earlier assessments.

In &quot;Mr. Wordsworth&quot;, for example, Hazlitt notes that &quot;it has been said of Mr. Wordsworth, that &#x27;he hates conchology, that he hates the Venus of Medicis.&#x27;...&quot; (Hazlitt&#x27;s own words in an article some years back). Indirectly apologising for his earlier tirade, Hazlitt here brings in a list of writers and artists, like Milton and Poussin, for whom Wordsworth did show appreciation.

Coleridge, whom Hazlitt had once idolised, gets special attention, but, again, with an attempt to moderate earlier criticisms. At an earlier time Hazlitt had dismissed most of Coleridge&#x27;s prose as &quot;dreary trash&quot;. Much of &quot;The Friend&quot; was &quot;sophistry&quot;. The &quot;Statesman&#x27;s Manual&quot; was not to be read &quot;with any patience&quot;. &quot;A Lay Sermon&quot; was enough to &quot;make a fool...of any man&quot;. For betraying their earlier liberal principles, both Coleridge and Southey were &quot;sworn brothers in the same cause of righteous apostacy&quot;.

Now, again, the harshness is softened, and the focus shifts to Coleridge&#x27;s positive attributes. One of the most learned and brilliant men of the age, Coleridge may not be its greatest writer—but he is its &quot;most impressive talker&quot;. Even his &quot;apostacy&quot; is somewhat excused by noting that in recent times, when &quot;Genius stopped the way of Legitimacy...it was to be...crushed&quot;, regrettably but understandably leading many former liberals to protect themselves by siding with the powers that be.

Southey, whose political about-face was more blatant than that of the others, still comes in for a measure of biting criticism: &quot;not truth, but self-opinion is the ruling principle of Mr. Southey&#x27;s mind&quot;. Yet Hazlitt goes out of his way to admire where he can. For example, &quot;Mr. Southey&#x27;s prose-style can scarcely be too much praised&quot;, and &quot;In all the relations and charities of private life, he is correct, exemplary, generous, just&quot;.

Hazlitt contrasts Scott and Byron; he skewers his nemesis Gifford; he praises—not without his usual strictures—Jeffrey; and goes on to portray, in one way or another, such notables as Mackintosh, Brougham, Canning, and Wilberforce.

His praise of the poet Thomas Campbell has been cited as one major instance where Hazlitt&#x27;s critical judgement proved wrong. Hazlitt can scarcely conceal his enthusiasm for such poems as Gertrude of Wyoming, but neither the poems nor Hazlitt&#x27;s judgement of them have withstood the test of time. His friends Hunt and Lamb get briefer coverage, and—Hazlitt was never one to mince words—they come in for some relatively gentle chiding amid the praise. One American author makes an appearance, Washington Irving, under his pen name of Geoffrey Crayon.

In this manner twenty-five character sketches combine to &quot;form a vivid panorama of the age&quot;. Through it all, the author reflects on the Spirit of the Age as a whole, as, for example, &quot;The present is an age of talkers, and not of doers; and the reason is, that the world is growing old. We are so far advanced in the Arts and Sciences, that we live in retrospect, and doat on past achievements&quot;.

Some critics have thought the essays in &quot;The Spirit of the Age&quot; highly uneven in quality and somewhat hastily thrown together, at best &quot;a series of perceptive but disparate and impressionistic sketches of famous contemporaries&quot;. It has also been noted, however, that the book is more than a mere portrait gallery. A pattern of ideas ties them together. No thesis is overtly stated, but some thoughts are developed consistently throughout.

Roy Park has noted in particular Hazlitt&#x27;s critique of excessive abstraction as a major flaw in the period&#x27;s dominant philosophy and poetry. (&quot;Abstraction&quot;, in this case, could be that of religion or mysticism as well as science.) This is the reason, according to Hazlitt, why neither Coleridge, nor Wordsworth, nor Byron could write effective drama. More representative of the finer spirit of the age was poetry that turned inward, focusing on individual perceptions, projections of the poets&#x27; sensibilities. The greatest of this type of poetry was Wordsworth&#x27;s, and that succeeded as far as any contemporary writing could.

Even if it took a century and a half for many of the book&#x27;s virtues to be realised, enough was recognised at the time to make the book one of Hazlitt&#x27;s most successful. Unsurprisingly the Tory &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; lamented that the pillory had fallen into disuse and wondered what &quot;adequate and appropriate punishment there is that we can inflict on this rabid caitiff&quot;. But the majority of the reviewers were enthusiastic. For example, the &quot;Eclectic Review&quot; marvelled at his ability to &quot;hit off a likeness with a few artist-like touches&quot; and &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, with a few reservations, found his style &quot;deeply impregnated with the spirit of the masters of our language, and strengthened by a rich infusion of golden ore...&quot;.

====European tour====
On 1 September 1824, Hazlitt and his wife began a tour of the European continent, crossing the English Channel by steamboat from Brighton to Dieppe and proceeding from there by coach and sometimes on foot to Paris and Lyon, crossing the Alps in Savoy, then continuing through Italy to Florence and Rome, the most southerly point on their route. Crossing the Apennines, they travelled to Venice, Verona, and Milan, then into Switzerland to Vevey and Geneva. Finally they returned via Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France again, arriving at Dover, England, on 16 October 1825.

There were two extended stops on this excursion: Paris, where the Hazlitts remained for three months; and Vevey, Switzerland, where they rented space in a farmhouse for three months. During those lengthy pauses, Hazlitt accomplished some writing tasks, primarily submitting an account of his trip in several instalments to &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;, which helped to pay for the trip. These articles were later collected and published in book form in 1826 as &quot;Notes of a Journey through France and Italy&quot; (despite the title, there is also much about the other countries he visited, particularly Switzerland).

This was an escape for a time from all the conflicts, the bitter reactions to his outspoken criticisms, and the attacks on his own publications back in England. And, despite interludes of illness, as well as the miseries of coach travel and the dishonesty of some hotel keepers and coach drivers, Hazlitt managed to enjoy himself. He reacted to his sight of Paris like a child entering a fairyland: &quot;The approach to the capital on the side of St. Germain&#x27;s is one continued succession of imposing beauty and artificial splendour, of groves, of avenues, of bridges, of palaces, and of towns like palaces, all the way to Paris, where the sight of the Thuilleries completes the triumph of external magnificence...&quot;

He remained with his wife in Paris for more than three months, eagerly exploring the museums, attending the theatres, wandering the streets, and mingling with the people. He was especially glad to be able to return to the Louvre and revisit the masterpieces he had adored twenty years earlier, recording for his readers all of his renewed impressions of canvases by Guido, Poussin, and Titian, among others.

He also was pleased to meet and befriend Henri Beyle, now better known by his &quot;nom de plume&quot; of Stendhal, who had discovered much to like in Hazlitt&#x27;s writings, as Hazlitt had in his.

Finally he and his wife resumed the journey to Italy. As they advanced slowly in those days of pre-railway travel (at one stage taking nearly a week to cover less than two hundred miles), Hazlitt registered a running commentary on the scenic points of interest. On the road between Florence and Rome, for example,
:Towards the close of the first day&#x27;s journey ... we had a splendid view of the country we were to travel, which lay stretched out beneath our feet to an immense distance, as we descended into the little town of Pozzo Borgo. Deep valleys sloped on each side of us, from which the smoke of cottages occasionally curled: the branches of an overhanging birch-tree or a neighbouring ruin gave relief to the grey, misty landscape, which was streaked by dark pine-forests, and speckled by the passing clouds; and in the extreme distance rose a range of hills glittering in the evening sun, and scarcely distinguishable from the ridge of clouds that hovered near them.
Hazlitt, in the words of Ralph Wardle, &quot;never stopped observing and comparing. He was an unabashed sightseer who wanted to take in everything available, and he could recreate vividly all he saw&quot;.

Yet frequently he showed himself to be more than a mere sightseer, with the painter, critic, and philosopher in him asserting their influence in turn or at once. A splendid scene on the shore of Lake Geneva, for example, viewed with the eye of both painter and art critic, inspired the following observation: &quot;The lake shone like a broad golden mirror, reflecting the thousand dyes of the fleecy purple clouds, while Saint Gingolph, with its clustering habitations, shewed like a dark pitchy spot by its side; and beyond the glimmering verge of the Jura ... hovered gay wreaths of clouds, fair, lovely, visionary, that seemed not of this world...No person can describe the effect; but so in Claude&#x27;s landscapes the evening clouds drink up the rosy light, and sink into soft repose!&quot;

Likewise, the philosopher in Hazlitt emerges in his account of the following morning: &quot;We had a pleasant walk the next morning along the side of the lake under the grey cliffs, the green hills and azure sky...the snowy ridges that seemed close to us at Vevey receding farther into a kind of lofty background as we advanced... The speculation of Bishop Berkeley, or some other philosopher, that distance is measured by motion and not by the sight, is verified here at every step&quot;.

He was also constantly considering the manners of the people and the differences between the English and the French (and later, to a lesser extent, the Italians and Swiss). Did the French really have a &quot;butterfly, airy, thoughtless, fluttering character&quot;? He was forced to revise his opinions repeatedly. In some ways the French seemed superior to his countrymen. Unlike the English, he discovered, the French attended the theatre reverently, respectfully, &quot;the attention ... like that of a learned society to a lecture on some scientific subject&quot;. And he found culture more widespread among the working classes: &quot;You see an apple-girl in Paris, sitting at a stall with her feet over a stove in the coldest weather, or defended from the sun by an umbrella, reading Racine and Voltaire&quot;.

Trying to be honest with himself, and every day discovering something new about French manners that confounded his preconceptions, Hazlitt was soon compelled to retract some of his old prejudices. &quot;In judging of nations, it will not do to deal in mere abstractions&quot;, he concluded. &quot;In countries, as well as individuals, there is a mixture of good and bad qualities; yet we attempt to strike a general balance, and compare the rules with the exceptions&quot;.

As he had befriended Stendhal in Paris, so in Florence, besides visiting the picture galleries, he struck up a friendship with Walter Savage Landor. He also spent much time with his old friend Leigh Hunt, now in residence there.

Hazlitt was ambivalent about Rome, the farthest point of his journey. His first impression was one of disappointment. He had expected primarily the monuments of antiquity. But, he asked, &quot;what has a green-grocer&#x27;s stall, a stupid English china warehouse, a putrid &quot;trattoria&quot;, a barber&#x27;s sign, an old clothes or old picture shop or a Gothic palace ... to do with ancient Rome?&quot; Further, &quot;the picture galleries at Rome disappointed me quite&quot;. Eventually he found plenty to admire, but the accumulation of monuments of art in one place was almost too much for him, and there were also too many distractions. There were the &quot;pride, pomp, and pageantry&quot; of the Catholic religion, as well as having to cope with the &quot;inconvenience of a stranger&#x27;s residence at Rome...You want some shelter from the insolence and indifference of the inhabitants...You have to squabble with every one about you to prevent being cheated, to drive a hard bargain in order to live, to keep your hands and your tongue within strict bounds, for fear of being stilettoed, or thrown into the Tower of St. Angelo, or remanded home. You have much to do to avoid the contempt of the inhabitants...You must run the gauntlet of sarcastic words or looks for a whole street, of laughter or want of comprehension in reply to all the questions you ask...

Venice presented fewer difficulties, and was a scene of special fascination for him: &quot;You see Venice rising from the sea&quot;, he wrote, &quot;its long line of spires, towers, churches, wharfs ... stretched along the water&#x27;s edge, and you view it with a mixture of awe and incredulity&quot;. The palaces were incomparable: &quot;I never saw palaces anywhere but at Venice&quot;. Of equal or even greater importance to him were the paintings. Here there were numerous masterpieces by his favourite painter Titian, whose studio he visited, as well as others by Veronese, Giorgione, Tintoretto, and more.

On the way home, crossing the Swiss Alps, Hazlitt particularly desired to see the town of Vevey, the scene of Rousseau&#x27;s 1761 novel &quot;La Nouvelle Héloïse&quot;, a love story that he associated with his disappointed love for Sarah Walker. He was so enchanted with the region even apart from its personal and literary associations that he remained there with his wife for three months, renting a floor of a farmhouse named &quot;Gelamont&quot; outside of town, where &quot;every thing was perfectly clean and commodious&quot;. The place was for the most part an oasis of tranquility for Hazlitt. As he reported:
:Days, weeks, months, and even years might have passed on much in the same manner... We breakfasted at the same hour, and the tea-kettle was always boiling...; a &quot;lounge&quot; in the orchard for an hour or two, and twice a week we could see the steam-boat creeping like a spider over the surface of the lake; a volume of the Scotch novels..., or M. Galignani&#x27;s Paris and London &quot;Observer&quot;, amused us till dinner time; then tea and a walk till the moon unveiled itself, &quot;apparent queen of the night,&quot; or the brook, swoln with a transient shower, was heard more distinctly in the darkness, mingling with the soft, rustling breeze; and the next morning the song of peasants broke upon refreshing sleep, as the sun glanced among the clustering vine-leaves, or the shadowy hills, as the mists retired from their summits, looked in at our windows.
Hazlitt&#x27;s time at Vevey was not passed entirely in a waking dream. As at Paris, and sometimes other stopping points such as Florence, he continued to write, producing one or two essays later included in &quot;The Plain Speaker&quot;, as well as some miscellaneous pieces. A side trip to Geneva during this period led him to a review of his &quot;Spirit of the Age&quot;, by Francis Jeffrey, in which the latter takes him to task for striving too hard after originality. As much as Hazlitt respected Jeffrey, this hurt (perhaps the more because of his respect), and Hazlitt, to work off his angry feelings, dashed off the only verse from his pen that has ever come to light, &quot;The Damned Author&#x27;s Address to His Reviewers&quot;, published anonymously on 18 September 1825, in the &quot;London and Paris Observer&quot;, and ending with the bitterly sardonic lines, &quot;And last, to make my measure full,/Teach me, great J[effre]y, to be dull!&quot;

Much of his time, however, was spent in a mellow mood. At this time he wrote &quot;Merry England&quot; (which appeared in the December 1825 &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot;). &quot;As I write this&quot;, he wrote, &quot;I am sitting in the open air in a beautiful valley... Intent upon the scene and upon the thoughts that stir within me, I conjure up the cheerful passages of my life, and a crowd of happy images appear before me&quot;.

The return to London in October was a letdown. The grey skies and bad food compared unfavorably with his recent retreat, and he was suffering from digestive problems (these recurred throughout much of his later life), though it was also good to be home. But he already had plans to return to Paris.

===Return to London, trip to Paris, and last years (1825–1830)===

====&quot;The old age of artists&quot;====
As comfortable as Hazlitt was on settling in again to his home on Down Street in London in late 1825 (where he remained until about mid-1827), the reality of earning a living again stared him in the face. He continued to provide a stream of contributions to various periodicals, primarily &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot;. The topics continued to be his favourites, including critiques of the &quot;new school of reformers&quot;, drama criticism, and reflections on manners and the tendencies of the human mind. He gathered previously published essays for the collection &quot;The Plain Speaker&quot;, writing a few new ones in the process. He also oversaw the publication in book form of his account of his recent Continental tour.

But what he most wanted was to write a biography of Napoleon. Now Sir Walter Scott was writing his own life of Napoleon, from a strictly conservative point of view, and Hazlitt wanted to produce one from a countervailing, liberal perspective. Really, his stance on Napoleon was his own, as he had idolised Napoleon for decades, and he prepared to return to Paris to undertake the research. First, however, he brought to fruition another favourite idea.

Always fascinated by artists in their old age (see &quot;On the Old Age of Artists&quot;), Hazlitt was especially interested in the painter James Northcote, student and later biographer of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and a Royal Academician. Hazlitt would frequently visit him—by then about 80 years old—and they conversed endlessly on men and manners, the illustrious figures of Northcote&#x27;s younger days, particularly Reynolds, and the arts, particularly painting.

Northcote was at this time a crochety, slovenly old man who lived in wretched surroundings and was known for his misanthropic personality. Hazlitt was oblivious to the surroundings and tolerated the grumpiness. Finding congeniality in Northcote&#x27;s company, and feeling many of their views to be in alignment, he transcribed their conversations from memory and published them in a series of articles entitled &quot;Boswell Redivivus&quot; in &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot;. (They were later collected under the title &quot;Conversations of James Northcote, Esq., R.A.&quot;) But there was little in common between these articles and Boswell&#x27;s life of Johnson. Hazlitt felt such a closeness to the old artist that in his conversations, Northcote was transformed into a kind of alter ego. Hazlitt made no secret of the fact that the words he ascribed to Northcote were not all Northcote&#x27;s own but sometimes expressed the views of Hazlitt as much as Hazlitt&#x27;s own words.

Some of the conversations were little more than gossip, and they spoke of their contemporaries without restraint. When the conversations were published, some of those contemporaries were outraged. Northcote denied the words were his; and Hazlitt was shielded from the consequences to a degree by his residing in Paris, where he was at work on what he thought would be his masterpiece.

The last conversation (originally published in &quot;The Atlas&quot; on 15 November 1829, when Hazlitt had less than a year to live) is especially telling. Whether it really occurred more or less as given, or was a construct of Hazlitt&#x27;s own imagination, it provides perspective on Hazlitt&#x27;s own position in life at that time.

In words attributed to Northcote: &quot;You have two faults: one is a &quot;feud&quot; or quarrel with the world, which makes you despair, and prevents you taking all the pains you might; the other is a carelessness and mismanagement, which makes you throw away the little you actually do, and brings you into difficulties that way.&quot;

Hazlitt justifies his own contrary attitude at length: &quot;When one is found fault with for nothing, or for doing one&#x27;s best, one is apt to give the world their revenge. All the former part of my life I was treated as a cipher; and since I have got into notice, I have been set upon as a wild beast. When this is the case, and you can expect as little justice as candour, you naturally in self-defence take refuge in a sort of misanthropy and cynical contempt for mankind.&quot;

And yet on reflection, Hazlitt felt that his life was not so bad after all:
:The man of business and fortune ... is up and in the city by eight, swallows his breakfast in haste, attends a meeting of creditors, must read Lloyd&#x27;s lists, consult the price of consols, study the markets, look into his accounts, pay his workmen, and superintend his clerks: he has hardly a minute in the day to himself, and perhaps in the four-and-twenty hours does not do a single thing that he would do if he could help it. Surely, this sacrifice of time and inclination requires some compensation, which it meets with. But how am I entitled to make my fortune (which cannot be done without all this anxiety and drudgery) who do hardly any thing at all, and never any thing but what I like to do? I rise when I please, breakfast &quot;at length&quot;, write what comes into my head, and after taking a mutton-chop and a dish of strong tea, go to the play, and thus my time passes.
He was perhaps overly self-disparaging in this self-portrait, but it opens a window on the kind of life Hazlitt was leading at this time, and how he evaluated it in contrast to the lives of his more overtly successful contemporaries.

====Hero worship====
In August 1826, Hazlitt and his wife set out for Paris again, so he could research what he hoped would be his masterpiece, a biography of Napoleon, seeking &quot;to counteract the prejudiced interpretations of Scott&#x27;s biography&quot;. Hazlitt &quot;had long been convinced that Napoleon was the greatest man of his era, the apostle of freedom, a born leader of men in the old heroic mould: he had thrilled to his triumphs over &#x27;legitimacy&#x27; and suffered real anguish at his downfall&quot;.

This did not work out quite as planned. His wife&#x27;s independent income allowed them to take lodgings in a fashionable part of Paris; he was comfortable, but also distracted by visitors and far from the libraries he needed to visit. Nor did he have access to all the materials that Scott&#x27;s stature and connections had provided him with for his own life of Napoleon. Hazlitt&#x27;s son also came to visit, and conflicts broke out between him and his father that also drove a wedge between Hazlitt and his second wife: their marriage was by now in free fall.

With his own works failing to sell, Hazlitt had to spend much time churning out more articles to cover expenses. Yet distractions notwithstanding, some of these essays rank among his finest, for example his &quot;On the Feeling of Immortality in Youth&quot;, published in &quot;The Monthly Magazine&quot; (not to be confused with the similarly named &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot;) in March 1827. The essay &quot;On a Sun-Dial&quot;, which appeared late in 1827, may have been written during a second tour to Italy with his wife and son.

On returning to London with his son in August 1827, Hazlitt was shocked to discover that his wife, still in Paris, was leaving him. He settled in modest lodgings on Half-Moon Street, and thereafter waged an unending battle against poverty, as he found himself forced to grind out a stream of mostly undistinguished articles for weeklies like &quot;The Atlas&quot; to generate desperately needed cash. Relatively little is known of Hazlitt&#x27;s other activities in this period. He spent as much time, apparently, at Winterslow as he did in London. Some meditative essays emerged from this stay in his favourite country retreat, and he also made progress with his life of Napoleon. But he also found himself struggling against bouts of illness, nearly dying at Winterslow in December 1827. Two volumes—the first half—of the Napoleon biography appeared in 1828, only to have its publisher fail soon thereafter. This entailed even more financial difficulties for the author, and what little evidence we have of his activities at the time consists in large part of begging letters to publishers for advances of money.

The easy life he had spoken of to Northcote had largely vanished by the time that conversation was published about a year before his death. By then he was overwhelmed by the degradation of poverty, frequent bouts of physical as well as mental illness—depression—caused by his failure to find true love and by his inability to bring to fruition his defence of the man he worshipped as a hero of liberty and fighter of despotism.

Although Hazlitt retained a few devoted admirers, his reputation among the general public had been demolished by the cadre of reviewers in Tory periodicals whose efforts Hazlitt had excoriated in &quot;On the Jealousy and the Spleen of Party&quot;. According to John Wilson of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, for example, Hazlitt had already &quot;been excommunicated from all decent society, and nobody would touch a dead book of his, any more than they would the body of a man who had died of the plague&quot;.

His four-volume life of Napoleon turned out to be a financial failure. Worse in retrospect, it was a poorly integrated hodgepodge of largely borrowed materials. Less than a fifth of his projected masterpiece consists of Hazlitt&#x27;s own words. Here and there, a few inspired passages stand out, such as the following:
:I have nowhere in any thing I may have written declared myself to be a Republican; nor should I think it worth while to be a martyr and a confessor to any form or mode of government. But what I have staked health and wealth, name and fame upon, and am ready to do so again and to the last gasp, is this, that there is a power in the people to change its government and its governors.
Hazlitt managed to complete &quot;The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte&quot; shortly before his death, but did not live to see it published in its entirety.

====Last years====


Few details remain of Hazlitt&#x27;s daily life in his last years. Much of his time was spent by choice in the bucolic setting of Winterslow, but he needed to be in London for business reasons. There, he seems to have exchanged visits with some of his old friends, but few details of these occasions were recorded. Often he was seen in the company of his son and son&#x27;s fiancée. Otherwise, he continued to produce a stream of articles to make ends meet.

In 1828, Hazlitt found work reviewing for the theatre again (for &quot;The Examiner&quot;). In playgoing he found one of his greatest consolations. One of his most notable essays, &quot;The Free Admission&quot;, arose from this experience. As he explained there, attending the theatre was not merely a great solace in itself; the atmosphere was conducive to contemplating the past, not just memories of the plays themselves or his reviewing of past performances, but the course of his whole life. In words written within his last few months, the possessor of a free admission to the theatre, &quot;ensconced in his favourite niche, looking from the &#x27;loop-holes of retreat&#x27; in the second circle ... views the pageant of the world played before him; melts down years to moments; sees human life, like a gaudy shadow, glance across the stage; and here tastes of all earth&#x27;s bliss, the sweet without the bitter, the honey without the sting, and plucks ambrosial fruits and amaranthine flowers (placed by the enchantress Fancy within his reach,) without having to pay a tax for it at the time, or repenting of it afterwards.&quot;

He found some time to return to his earlier philosophical pursuits, including popularised presentations of the thoughts expressed in earlier writings. Some of these, such as meditations on &quot;Common Sense&quot;, &quot;Originality&quot;, &quot;The Ideal&quot;, &quot;Envy&quot;, and &quot;Prejudice&quot;, appeared in &quot;The Atlas&quot; in early 1830. At some point in this period he summarised the spirit and method of his life&#x27;s work as a philosopher, which he had never ceased to consider himself to be; but &quot;The Spirit of Philosophy&quot; was not published in his lifetime. He also began contributing once again to &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot;; paying better than the other journals, it helped stave off hunger.

After a brief stay on Bouverie Street in 1829, sharing lodgings with his son, Hazlitt moved into a small apartment at 6 Frith Street, Soho. He continued to turn out articles for &quot;The Atlas&quot;, &quot;The London Weekly Review&quot;, and now &quot;The Court Journal&quot;. Plagued more frequently by painful bouts of illness, he began to retreat within himself. Even at this time, however, he turned out a few notable essays, primarily for &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot;. Turning his suffering to advantage, he described the experience, with copious observations on the effects of illness and recovery on the mind, in &quot;The Sick Chamber&quot;. In one of his last respites from pain, reflecting on his personal history, he wrote, &quot;This is the time for reading. ... A cricket chirps on the hearth, and we are reminded of Christmas gambols long ago. ... A rose smells doubly sweet ... and we enjoy the idea of a journey and an inn the more for having been bed-rid. But a book is the secret and sure charm to bring all these implied associations to a focus. ... If the stage [alluding to his remarks in &quot;The Free-Admission&quot;] shows us the masks of men and the pageant of the world, books let us into their souls and lay open to us the secrets of our own. They are the first and last, the most home-felt, the most heart-felt of our enjoyments&quot;. At this time he was reading the novels of Edward Bulwer in hopes of reviewing them for &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot;.

Such respites from pain did not last, though news of The Three Glorious Days that drove the Bourbons from France in July raised his spirits. A few visitors cheered these days, but, toward the end, he was frequently too sick to see any of them. By September 1830, Hazlitt was confined to his bed, with his son in attendance, his pain so acute that his doctor kept him drugged on opium much of the time. His last few days were spent in delirium, obsessed with some woman, which in later years gave rise to speculation: was it Sarah Walker? Or was it, as biographer Stanley Jones believes, more likely to have been a woman he had met more recently at the theatre? Finally, with his son and a few others in attendance, he died on 18 September. His last words were reported to have been &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve had a happy life&quot;.

William Hazlitt was buried in the churchyard of St Anne&#x27;s Church, Soho in London on 23 September 1830, with only his son William, Charles Lamb, P.G. Patmore, and possibly a few other friends in attendance.

==Posthumous reputation==

His works having fallen out of print, Hazlitt&#x27;s reputation declined. In the late 1990s his reputation was reasserted by admirers and his works reprinted. Two major works by others then appeared: &quot;The Day-Star of Liberty: William Hazlitt&#x27;s Radical Style&quot; by Tom Paulin in 1998 and &quot;Quarrel of the Age: The Life and Times of William Hazlitt&quot; by A. C. Grayling in 2000. Hazlitt&#x27;s reputation has continued to rise, and now many contemporary thinkers, poets, and scholars consider him one of the greatest critics in the English language, and its finest essayist.

In 2003, following a lengthy appeal initiated by Ian Mayes together with A. C. Grayling, Hazlitt&#x27;s gravestone was restored in St Anne&#x27;s Churchyard, and unveiled by Michael Foot. A Hazlitt Society was then inaugurated. The society publishes an annual peer-reviewed journal called &quot;The Hazlitt Review&quot;.

The last place Hazlitt lived in, on Frith Street in London, is now a hotel, Hazlitt&#x27;s.

The Jonathan Bate novel &quot;The Cure for Love&quot; (1998) was based indirectly on Hazlitt&#x27;s life.

<doc id="161968" wikidata="Q242800" url="?curid=161968" title="Minamoto no Yoritomo">
<text>was the founder and the first shogun of the Kamakura shogunate, ruling from 1192 until 1199, also the first ruling shogun in the history of Japan. He was the husband of Hōjō Masako who acted as regent (&quot;shikken&quot;) after his death.

Yoritomo was the son of Minamoto no Yoshitomo and belonged to Seiwa Genji&#x27;s prestigious Kawachi Genji family. After successfully maneuvering himself to the position of rightful heir of the Minamoto clan, he led his clan against the Taira from his capital in Kamakura, beginning the Genpei War in 1180. After five years of civil war, the Minamoto clan finally defeated the Taira in the Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185. Yoritomo established the supremacy of the samurai caste and the first shogunate (&quot;bakufu&quot;) which was to be centered around Kamakura, thus beginning the feudal age in Japan, which lasted until the 17th century.

==Early life==

Yoritomo was the third son of Minamoto no Yoshitomo, heir of the Minamoto (Seiwa Genji) clan, and his official wife, Yura-Gozen, daughter of Fujiwara no Suenori, High Priest of Atsuta Shrine and a member of the powerful Fujiwara clan. Yoritomo was born in the family villa, on the western side of Atsuta Shrine, in Atsuta, Nagoya, Owari Province (present-day Seigan-ji). At the time, his grandfather Minamoto no Tameyoshi was the head of the Minamoto clan. His childhood name was Oniwakamaru (鬼武丸). He was a descendant of Emperor Seiwa.

In 1156, factional divisions in the court erupted into open warfare within the capital. The cloistered Emperor Toba and his son Emperor Go-Shirakawa sided with the son of Fujiwara regent Fujiwara no Tadazane, Fujiwara no Tadamichi as well as Taira no Kiyomori (heir of the Taira clan at the time), while Cloistered Emperor Sutoku sided with Tadazane&#x27;s younger son, Fujiwara no Yorinaga. This is known as the Hōgen Rebellion.

The Minamoto clan were split. The head of the clan, Tameyoshi, sided with Sutoku. However, his son, Yoshitomo (father of Yoritomo), sided with Toba and Go-Shirakawa, as well as Kiyomori. In the end, the supporters of Go-Shirakawa won the civil war, thus ensuring victory for Yoshitomo and Kiyomori. Sutoku was placed under house arrest, and Yorinaga was fatally wounded in battle. Tameyoshi was executed by the forces of Yoshitomo. Nonetheless, Go-Shirakawa and Kiyomori were ruthless, and Yoshitomo found himself as the head of the Minamoto clan, while Yoritomo became the heir.

Yoritomo and the Minamoto clan descended from the imperial family on his father&#x27;s side. Nonetheless, in Kyoto, the Taira clan, now under the leadership of Kiyomori, and the Minamoto clan, under the leadership of Yoshitomo, began to factionalize again.

Four years later, Kiyomori supported Fujiwara no Michinori, also known as Shinzei. However, Yoshitomo supported Fujiwara no Nobuyori. This was known as the Heiji Rebellion. Nonetheless, the Minamoto were not well prepared, and the Taira took control of Kyoto. Shinzei&#x27;s mansion was attacked by the Taira; Shinzei escaped, only to be captured and decapitated shortly thereafter. The Taira then burned the ex-emperor&#x27;s palace, defeating the Minamoto. Yoshitomo fled the capital but was later betrayed and executed by a retainer.

In the aftermath, harsh terms were imposed on the Minamoto and their allies. Only Yoshitomo&#x27;s three young boys remained alive, so that Kiyomori and the Taira clan were now the undisputed leaders of Japan. Yoritomo, the new head of the Minamoto, was not executed by Kiyomori because of pleas from Kiyomori&#x27;s stepmother but was exiled. Yoritomo&#x27;s brothers, Minamoto no Noriyori and Minamoto no Yoshitsune were also allowed to live.

Yoritomo grew up in exile. He married into the Hōjō clan, led by Hōjō Tokimasa, marrying Tokimasa&#x27;s daughter, Hōjō Masako. Meanwhile, he was notified of events in Kyoto.

==Call to arms and the Genpei War (1180–1185)==
In 1180, Prince Mochihito, a son of Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa, made a national call to arms of the Minamoto clan all over Japan to rebel against the Taira. Yoritomo took part in this, especially after tensions escalated between the Taira and Minamoto after the death of Minamoto no Yorimasa and Prince Mochihito himself.

Yoritomo established himself as the rightful heir of the Minamoto clan and set up a capital in Kamakura to the east. Not all Minamoto thought of Yoritomo as rightful heir, however. His uncle, Minamoto no Yukiie, and his cousin Minamoto no Yoshinaka, conspired against him.

In September 1180, Yoritomo was defeated at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, his first major battle, when Ōba Kagechika led a rapid night attack. After his defeat in Mt. Ishibashiyama, Minamoto no Yoritomo fled into the Hakone mountains, stayed in Yugawara, then escaped from Manazuru-Iwa to Awa (south of present-day Chiba). Yoritomo spent the next six months raising a new army.

Taira no Kiyomori died in 1181 and the Taira clan was now led by Taira no Munemori. Munemori took a much more aggressive policy against the Minamoto and attacked Minamoto bases from Kyoto in the Genpei War. Nonetheless, Yoritomo was well protected in Kamakura.

His brothers Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori defeated the Taira in several battles, but they could not stop Minamoto no Yoshinaka, Yoritomo&#x27;s rival, from entering Kyoto in 1183 and chasing the Taira south. The Taira took Emperor Antoku with them. In 1184, the Minamoto replaced Antoku with Emperor Go-Toba.

From 1181 to 1184, a de facto truce with the Taira-dominated court allowed Yoritomo the time to build an administration of his own, centered on his military headquarters in Kamakura. In the end he triumphed over his rival cousins, who sought to steal control of the clan from him, and over the Taira, who suffered a terrible defeat at the Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185. Yoritomo established the supremacy of the samurai caste and the first shogunate (bakufu) at Kamakura, thus beginning the feudal age in Japan, which lasted until the 17th century.

==Later years and death==
As he rose to a position of power, Yoritomo began to defy and undermine the authority of Emperor Go-Shirakawa by appointing his own &quot;jitō&quot; (district stewards) and &quot;shugo&quot; (constables), thus eroding the central government&#x27;s local administrative power.

In the summer of 1189, Yoritomo invaded and subjugated the northern provinces of Mutsu and Dewa. In December 1190 Yoritomo took up residence in his Rokuhara mansion at the capital, the former headquarters of the Taira clan. When his old rival, Emperor Go-Shirakawa died in the spring of 1192, there was no longer anyone standing in the way of his ultimate ambition. Thus, Yoritomo gave himself the title of &quot;Sei-i Tai Shōgun&quot; (Barbarian-quelling Generalissimo) which formally placed all the feudal lords and both the &quot;jitō&quot; and &quot;shugo&quot; under his direct control. Thus creating a new feudal state organized around Kamakura while Kyoto was relegated to the role of &quot;national ceremony and ritual&quot;.

Yoritomo gathered his &quot;gokenin&quot; in May 1193 and arranged a grand hunting event, Fuji no Makigari. On May 16, Yoritomo&#x27;s 12-year-old son Yoriie shot a deer for the first time. Hunting was stopped and a festival was held in the evening. Yoritomo rejoiced in his son&#x27;s achievement and sent a messenger to his wife Masako, but Masako sent the messenger back, saying that a military commander&#x27;s son being able to shoot a deer is nothing to celebrate.

The Revenge of the Soga Brothers took place on May 28 of the same year at the Fuji no Makigari hunting event. The brothers Soga Sukenari and Soga Tokimune murdered the killer of their father, Kudō Suketsune. The brothers managed to kill 10 other participants until Nitta Tadatsune killed Sukenari. Then, Tokimune raided Yoritomo&#x27;s mansion attempting to attack Yoritomo, but was finally taken down by Gosho no Gorōmaru, thus saving Yoritomo from a possible assassination attempt and ending the massacre. After this, Yoritomo took Tokimune in for questioning and had him executed later.

Yoritomo was ordained as a Buddhist monk in 1199 and left his home. He received the Buddhist name Bukōshōgendaizenmon (武皇嘯厚大禅門). He died two days later at the age of 51.

==Appearance and personality==
According to &quot;The Tale of Heiji,&quot; Yoritomo was &quot;more adult-like than others of his age&quot;, and the figure of a young warrior Yoritomo appears in the picture scroll of &quot;The Tale of Heiji&quot;. &quot;Genpei Jōsuiki&quot; describes Yoritomo saying &quot;his face is large and appearance is beautiful.&quot; The imperial messenger Nakahara no Yasusada, who met Yoritomo in Kamakura in August 1183, said that &quot;he is short and his face is large, his appearance is graceful and language is civilized.&quot;

Kujō no Kanezane writes in his diary &quot;Tamaha&quot; that &quot;Yoritomo&#x27;s body is of rigorous power, and his fierce nature is accompanied with a clear distinction and firm resolution of the judgement of right and wrong.&quot; Yoritomo practiced &quot;shudō&quot; with Yoshinao, a member of the Imperial Guard.

Historian Hideo Kuroda organized and examined the portraits and statues of Minamoto no Yoritomo and has concluded as follows. When comparing the statues of Minamoto no Yoritomo in Higashihirozo and Hōjō Tokiyori in Kenchō-ji, from the facial expression to size, they are almost identical, and there is evidence that the &quot;kariginu&quot; was remodeled into a &quot;sokutai&quot;, the formal dress of the shogun, by adding a &quot;hirao&quot; and &quot;sekitai.&quot; Kuroda argues that the statue was originally a statue of Hōjō Tokiyori sculpted in Kamakura in the 14th century, but after the original statue of Yoritomo was lost, an altered statue of Tokiyori was used as a replacement. On the other hand, he considers the inscription on the statue of Minamoto no Yoritomo in Kai Province, Zenkō-ji to be the name of the repairer instead of the name of the sculptor, and that it was made at the request of Hōjō Masako in the first quarter of the 13th century. Thus, Kuroda concludes that this statue is the only accurate depiction of Minamoto no Yoritomo.

==Legacy==
In the words of George Bailey Sansom, &quot;Yoritomo was a truly great man … his foresight was remarkable, but so was his practical good sense in setting up machinery to match his own expanding power.&quot;

Yoritomo&#x27;s wife&#x27;s family, the Hōjō, took control after his death at Kamakura, maintaining power over the shogunate until 1333, under the title of &quot;shikken&quot; (regent to the &quot;shōgun&quot;). One of his brothers-in-law was Ashikaga Yoshikane.
The &quot;stone pagoda&quot; traditionally believed to be his grave is still maintained today, adjacent to Shirahata Shrine, a short distance from the spot believed to be the site of the so-called Ōkura Bakufu, his shogunate&#x27;s administrative-governmental offices.

==Cultural references==
He appears as a hero unit in &quot;Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&quot;, and as a hero unit in &quot;Total War: Shogun 2&quot;.

A character named &quot;Yoritomo&quot; appears in Book 6: &quot;The Lords of the Rising Sun&quot; in the Fabled Lands adventure gamebook series, where Yoritomo is the self-proclaimed &quot;shōgun&quot; and on the verge of war with &quot;Lord Kiyomori&quot;.

He appears as the final boss in Genpei Toma Den, an arcade game created by Namco in which the player character is Taira no Kagekiyo, another Japanese historical figure.

He also appears as a prominent character in the 2021 anime series &quot;The Heike Story&quot;.

<doc id="161971" wikidata="Q196627" url="?curid=161971" title="New Year's Day">
<text>In the Gregorian calendar, New Year&#x27;s Day is the first day of the calendar year, 1 January. Most solar calendars, such as the Gregorian and Julian calendars, begin the year regularly at or near the northern winter solstice. In contrast, cultures and religions that observe a lunisolar or lunar calendar celebrate their Lunar New Year at varying points relative to the solar year.

In pre-Christian Rome, under the Julian calendar, the day was dedicated to Janus, god of gateways and beginnings, for whom January is also named. From Roman times until the mid-18th century, the new year was celebrated at various stages and in various parts of Christian Europe on 25 December, on 1 March, on 25 March and on the movable feast of Easter.

In the present day, with most countries now using the Gregorian calendar as their civil calendar, 1 January according to Gregorian calendar is among the most celebrated of public holidays in the world, often observed with fireworks at the stroke of midnight following New Year&#x27;s Eve as the new year starts in each time zone. Other global New Year&#x27;s Day traditions include making New Year&#x27;s resolutions and calling one&#x27;s friends and family.


==History==
The ancient Babylonian calendar was lunisolar, and around the year 2000BC began observing a spring festival and the new year during the month of Nisan, around the time of the March equinox. The early Roman calendar designated 1 March as the first day of the year. The calendar had just 10 months, beginning with March. That the new year once began with the month of March is still reflected in some of the names of the months. September through to December, the ninth through to the twelfth months of the Gregorian calendar, were originally positioned as the seventh through to the tenth months. (&quot;Septem&quot; is Latin for &quot;seven&quot;; &quot;octo&quot;, &quot;eight&quot;; &quot;novem&quot;, &quot;nine&quot;; and &quot;decem&quot;, &quot;ten&quot;) Roman mythology usually credits their second king Numa with the establishment of the two new months of Ianuarius and Februarius. These were first placed at the end of the year, but at some point came to be considered the first two months instead.

The January kalend ( ), the start of the month of January, came to be celebrated as the new year at some point after it became the day for the inaugurating new consuls in 153BC as a result of the rebellion in Hispania which began the second Celtiberian War. Romans had long dated their years by these consulships, rather than sequentially, and making the kalends of January start the new year aligned this dating. Still, private and religious celebrations around the March new year continued for some time and there is no consensus on the question of the timing for 1 January&#x27;s new status. Once it became the new year, however, it became a time for family gatherings and celebrations. A series of disasters, notably including the failed rebellion of M. Aemilius Lepidus in 78BC, established a superstition against allowing Rome&#x27;s market days to fall on the kalends of January and the pontiffs employed intercalation to avoid its occurrence.

===New Year&#x27;s Day in the older Julian calendar===
The Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, was a reform of the Roman calendar. It took effect on , by edict. The calendar became the predominant calendar in the Roman Empire and subsequently, most of the Western world for more than 1,600 years. The Roman calendar began the year on 1 January, and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform. However, even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar, they started the new year on different dates. The Alexandrian calendar in Egypt started on 29 August (30 August after an Alexandrian leap year). Several local provincial calendars were aligned to start on the birthday of the Emperor Augustus, 23 September. The indiction caused the Byzantine year, which used the Julian calendar, to begin on 1 September; this date is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church for the beginning of the liturgical year.

At various times and in various places throughout mediaeval Christian Europe, the new year was celebrated on 25 December in honour of the birth of Jesus; 1 March in the old Roman style; 25 March in honour of Lady Day (the Feast of the Annunciation, the date of the conception of Jesus); and on the movable feast of Easter.

====Christian observance====

Christians of various denominations (Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Moravians, among others) often attend a watchnight service (also known as a Watchnight Mass if Holy Communion is celebrated) on the night of New Year&#x27;s Eve and this liturgy concludes in the morning of New Year&#x27;s Day. Watchnight services provide the opportunity for Christians to review the year that has passed and make confession, and then prepare for the year ahead by praying and resolving. The services often include singing, praying, exhorting, preaching, and Holy Communion.

As a date in the Christian calendar, New Year&#x27;s Day liturgically marked the Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus, which is still observed as such in the Lutheran Church, Anglican Church, the Ambrosian section of the Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox Church (Julian calendar, see below) and in Traditional Catholicism by those who retain the usage of the General Roman Calendar of 1960. The mainstream Roman Catholic Church celebrates on this day the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. In Western Christianity, the Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus Christ marks the eighth day (octave day) of Christmastide.

====Gift giving====
Among the 7th-century pagans of Flanders and the Netherlands, it was the custom to exchange gifts at the winter solstice. This custom was deplored by Saint Eligius (died 659 or 660), who warned the Flemish and Dutch: &quot;(Do not) make visuals, [little figures of the Old Woman], little deer or iotticos or set tables [for the house-elf, compare Puck] at night or exchange New Year gifts or supply superfluous drinks [another Yule custom].&quot; 

On the date that Christians celebrated the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ (January 1), they exchanged Christmas presents because the feast fell within the 12 days of the Christmas season in the Western Christian liturgical calendar; the custom of exchanging Christmas gifts in a Christian context is traced back to the Biblical Magi who gave gifts to the Christ Child. In Tudor England, 1 January (as the Feast of the Circumcision, not New Year&#x27;s Day), along with Christmas Day and Twelfth Night, was celebrated as one of three main festivities among the twelve days of Christmastide, and gift-giving was customary at the royal court.

===Acceptance of 1 January as New Year&#x27;s Day===
Most nations of Europe and their colonies officially adopted 1 January as New Year&#x27;s Day somewhat before they adopted the Gregorian calendar. Most of Germany changed to 1 January from 1544, the Netherlands did so from 1556 or 1573 according to sect, Spain and Portugal from 1556, France from 1564, Italy (pre-unification) on a variety of dates, Sweden, Norway and Denmark from 1599, Scotland from 1600, and Russia from 1700 or 1725. England, Wales, Ireland, and Britain&#x27;s American colonies adopted 1 January as New Year&#x27;s Day from 1752.

====Great Britain and the British Empire====
Until Tuesday, 31 December 1751 (except Scotland), the Kingdom of Great Britain and the British Empire at the time had retained 25 March as the official start of the year, although informal use of 1 January had become common. With the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, Britain and the Empire formally adopted 1 January as New Year&#x27;s Day in 1752 and, with the same Act, also discarded the Julian calendar at the end of Wednesday, 2 September of that same year (though the actions are otherwise unrelated). The Act came into effect &quot;following the last said day of December 1751&quot;.

By 1750, adjustments needed to be made for an eleven-day difference between the older Julian calendar and the newer (and more accurate) Gregorian calendar. There was some religious dissent regarding feast days being moved, especially Christmas Day (see Old Christmas), and isolated communities continued the old reckoning to a greater or lesser extent. The years 1800 and 1900 were leap years in the Julian calendar but not in the Gregorian, so the difference increased to twelve days, then thirteen. The year 2000 was a leap year in both calendars.
*In the Gwaun Valley in Wales, the new year is celebrated on 13 January, still based on the 19th century difference in the calendars.
*Foula, in the Shetland islands celebrates Yule (&#x27;Old Christmas&#x27; rather than the December solstice) on 6 January and Newerday on 13 January. Again, both dates reflect the 19th century reckoning and were not moved again in 1900.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
At various stages during the first half of the twentieth century, all countries in Eastern Christendom adopted the Gregorian calendar as their civil calendar but continued, and have continued into modern times, to use the Julian Calendar for ecclesiastical purposes. As 1 January (Julian) equates to 14 January (Gregorian), a religious celebration of the New Year on this date may seem strange to Western eyes.

==New Year&#x27;s Day in other calendars==

In cultures and religions that traditionally or currently use calendars other than the Gregorian, New Year&#x27;s Day is often also an important celebration. Some countries concurrently use Gregorian and another calendar. New Year&#x27;s Day in the alternative calendar attracts alternative celebrations of that new year:

===African===
*Nayrouz and Enkutatash are the New Year&#x27;s Days of the Coptic Egyptians and the Ethiopians, respectively. Between 1900 and 2100, both occur on 11 September in most years and on 12 September in the years before Gregorian leap years. They preserve the legacy of the ancient Egyptian new year Wept Renpet, which originally marked the onset of the Nile flood but which wandered through the seasons until the introduction of leap years to the traditional calendar by Augustus in 30-20BC. In Ethiopia, the new year is held to mark the end of the summer rainy season.
*The Odunde Festival is also called the African New Year is celebrated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States on the second Sunday of June. While the name was based on the Yoruba African culture, its celebration marks the largest African celebration in the world, which more or less was started by a local tradition.
*The Sotho people of Lesotho and South Africa celebrate Selemo sa Basotho on 1 August during the end of the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s winter. This is based on the Sotho calendar, and includes observances such as &quot;Mokete wa lewa&quot;, a celebration that follows the harvest.

===East Asian===

*Chinese New Year is celebrated in some countries in East Asia, including China, and some in Southeast Asia, including Singapore. It is the first day of the traditional Chinese calendar, a lunar calendar that is corrected for the solar changes every three years (i.e. a lunisolar calendar). The holiday normally falls between 20 January and 20 February. The holiday is celebrated with food, family, lucky money (usually in a red envelope), and many other red things that are believed to bring good luck. Lion and dragon dances, drums, fireworks, firecrackers, and other types of entertainment fill the streets on this day. 1 January is also a legal holiday in China, and people celebrate the Gregorian New Year on this day, but it is not as grand as the traditional Chinese New Year.

*Japanese New Year is celebrated on 1 January because the Gregorian calendar is now used in Japan instead of the Chinese calendar (which was in use until 1873).

*Korean New Year is celebrated on the first day of the traditional Korean calendar in South Korea. The first day of this lunisolar calendar, called &quot;Seollal&quot; (), is an important national holiday (along with &quot;Chuseok&quot;), with a minimum of three days off work and school. Koreans celebrate New Year&#x27;s Day by preparing food for their ancestors&#x27; spirits, visiting ancestors&#x27; graves, and playing Korean games such as &quot;yunnori&quot; with families and friends. Young children show respect to their parents, grandparents, relatives, and other elders by bowing down in a traditional way and are given good wishes and some money by the elders.
**In addition, South Koreans celebrate the 1 January New Year&#x27;s Day of the Gregorian Calendar, and as a national holiday, people have the day off. The Gregorian calendar is now the official civil calendar in South Korea, so the populace now considers the 1 January New Year&#x27;s Day the first day of the year. South Koreans calculate their age using the East Asian age reckoning method, with all South Koreans adding a year to their age at midnight of the New Year (of the Gregorian, not the Korean calendar). Families enjoy the New Year by counting down to midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve on 31 December.
*North Koreans celebrate the New Year&#x27;s Day holiday on the first day of the Gregorian calendar, 1 January. This New Year&#x27;s Day, also called &quot;Seollal&quot;, is a big holiday in North Korea, The first day of the Korean calendar is regarded as a day for relaxation, but North Koreans consider the first day of the Gregorian calendar to be even more important.

===Southeast Asian===
*Cambodian New Year (Chaul Chnam Thmey) is celebrated on 13 April or 14 April. There are three days for the Khmer New Year: the first day is called &quot;Moha Songkran&quot;, the second is called &quot;Virak Wanabat&quot; and the final day is called &quot;Virak Loeurng Sak&quot;. During these periods, Cambodians often go to the pagoda or play traditional games. Phnom Penh is usually quiet during Khmer New Year as most Cambodians prefer spending it at their respective hometowns.
*Thai New Year is celebrated on 13 April or 14 April and is called Songkran in the local language. People usually come out to splash water on one another. The throwing of water originated as a blessing. By capturing the water after it had been poured over the Buddhas for cleansing, this &quot;blessed&quot; water is gently poured on the shoulder of elders and family for good fortune.
*Thingyan, Burmese new year&#x27;s celebrations, typically begin on 13 April but the actual New Year&#x27;s Day falls on 17 April in the 21st century. The day has slowly drifted over the centuries. In the 20th century, the day fell on 15 or 16 April while in the 17th century, it fell on 9 or 10 April.

*Vietnamese New Year (Tết Nguyên Đán or Tết), more commonly known by its shortened name Tết or &quot;Vietnamese Lunar New Year&quot;, is the most important and popular holiday and festival in Vietnam, the holiday normally falls between 20 January and 20 February. It is the Vietnamese New Year marking the arrival of spring based on the Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar. The name Tết Nguyên Đán is Sino-Vietnamese for Feast of the First Morning, derived from the Hán nôm characters 節 元 旦.

===South Asian===
*Diwali related New Year&#x27;s celebrations include Marwari new year and Gujarati new year.
*Indian New Year&#x27;s days has several variations depending on the region and is based on the Hindu calendar.
*Hindu In Hinduism, different regional cultures celebrate the new year at different times of the year. In Assam, Bengal, Kerala, Nepal, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu households celebrate the new year when the Sun enters Aries on the Hindu calendar. This is normally on 14 April or 15 April, depending on the leap year. Elsewhere in northern/central India, the Vikram Samvat calendar is followed. According to that, the new year day is the first day of the Chaitra Month, also known as Chaitra Shukla Pratipada or Gudi Padwa. This is basically the first month of the Hindu calendar, the first Shukla paksha (fortnight) and the first day. This normally comes around 23–24 March, mostly around the Spring Equinox in Gregorian Calendar. The new year is celebrated by paying respect to elders in the family and by seeking their blessings. They also exchange tokens of good wishes for a healthy and prosperous year ahead.
*Malayalam New Year (Puthuvarsham) is celebrated either on the first day of the month of Medam in mid-April which is known as Vishu, or the first day of the month of Chingam, in the Malayalam Calendar in mid-August according to another reckoning. Unlike most other calendar systems in India, the New Year&#x27;s Day on the Malayalam Calendar is not based on any astronomical event. It is just the first day of the first of the 12 months on the Malayalam Calendar. The Malayalam Calendar (called Kollavarsham) originated in 825 AD, based on general agreement among scholars, with the re-opening of the city of Kollam (on Malabar Coast), which had been destroyed by a natural disaster.
*Nepal Sambat is the Nepalese New Year celebration specially by the Newar community. Nepali ethnic groups like Gurung, Sherpa and Tamang celebrate Lhosar. While officially Baisakh ek gatey is celebrated. However, there is increased demand from Nepalese of all ethnicity to replace Vikram Sambat with Nepal Sambat as Nepal Sambat is indigenous to Nepal while Vikram Sambat came from India.
*Pahela Baishakh or Bangla Nabobarsho is the first day of the Bengali Calendar. It is celebrated on 14 April as a national holiday in Bangladesh, and on 14 or 15 April in the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, and part of Assam by people of Bengali heritage, irrespective of their religious faith.
*The Sikh New Year is celebrated as per the Nanakshahi calendar. The epoch of this calendar is the birth of the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak in 1469. New Year&#x27;s Day falls annually on what is 14 March in the Gregorian Western calendar.

*Sinhalese New Year is celebrated in Sri Lankan culture predominantly by the Sri Lankan Sinhalese, while the Tamil New Year on the same day is celebrated by Sri Lankan Tamils. The Sinhalese New Year (&quot;aluth avurudda&quot;), marks the end of the harvest season, by the month of Bak (April) between 13 and 14 April. There is an astrologically generated time gap between the passing year and the New Year, which is based on the passing of the sun from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries) in the celestial sphere. The astrological time difference between the New Year and the passing year (&quot;nonagathe&quot;) is celebrated with several Buddhist rituals and customs that are to be concentrated on, which are exclusive of all types of &#x27;work&#x27;. After Buddhist rituals and traditions are attended to, Sinhala and Tamil New Year-based social gatherings and festive parties with the aid of firecrackers, and fireworks would be organized. The exchange of gifts, cleanliness, the lighting of the oil lamp, making &quot;kiribath&quot; (milk rice), and even the Asian Koel are significant aspects of the Sinhalese New Year.
*Tamil New Year (Puthandu) is celebrated on 13 April or 14 April. Traditionally, it is celebrated as Chiththirai Thirunaal in parts of Tamil Nadu to mark the event of the Sun entering Aries. Panchangam (almanac), is read in temples to mark the start of the Year.
*Telugu New Year (Ugadi), Kannada New Year (Yugadi) is celebrated in March (generally), April (occasionally). Traditionally, it is celebrated as Chaitram Chaitra Shuddha Padyami in parts of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka to mark the event of New Year&#x27;s Day for the people of the Deccan region of India. It falls on a different day every year because the Hindu calendar is a lunisolar calendar. The Saka calendar begins with the month of Chaitra (March–April) and Ugadi/Yugadi marks the first day of the new year. Chaitra is the first month in Panchanga which is the Indian calendar. Panchangam (almanac), is read in temples to mark the start of the Year.

===Middle Eastern===
The major religions of the Middle East are Islam and Judaism: their adherents worldwide celebrate the first day of their respective new religious calendar years.

====Islam====
The two primary sects of Islam are Sunni Islam and Shia Islam. They have different calendars though for both the epoch of the calendar is the Hijrah.

*Islamic New Year (or &quot;Hijri New Year&quot;, )) is the day in Sunni Islamic culture that marks the beginning of a new year in the Lunar Hijri calendar. It disregards the solar year: its New Year&#x27;s Day is on a different Gregorian date each year because it is a lunar calendar of twelve lunar months, making it on average 11 to 12 days shorter than a solar year. The first day of the year is observed on the first day of Muharram, the first month in this calendar.
*Nowruz marks the first day of spring and the beginning of the year in the Solar Hijri calendar (one of the Iranian calendars). It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical Northern spring equinox, which usually occurs on or about 20 March (Gregorian calendar). Nowruz has been celebrated for over 3,000 years by the cultural continent of Iran, including Kurdistan and Afghanistan. The holiday is also celebrated and observed by many parts of Central Asia, South Asia, Northwestern China, Crimea and some groups in the Balkans. As well as being a Zoroastrian holiday and having significance amongst the Zoroastrian ancestors of modern Iranians, the same time is celebrated in the Indian sub-continent as the new year. The moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator and equalizes night and day is calculated exactly every year and Iranian families gather together to observe the rituals.

====Judaism====
*Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year), is celebrated by Jews in Israel and throughout the world. The date is the new moon of Tishrei, which is the seventh month counting from Nisan, the first month of Spring. It always falls during September or October. The holiday is celebrated by blasting of shofar trumpets, to signify it as a day of judgment, by prayers of penitence, by readings from the law and prophets, and by special meals. The night of 31 December/1 January, the New Year according to the Gregorian calendar, is also celebrated widely in Israel and is referred to as Sylvester or the civil new year.

===Martian===

According to a convention established by NASA, the Martian year begins on its Northward equinox, the spring equinox of its northern hemisphere. Its most recent New Year&#x27;s Day (of MY37) coincided with 26 December 2022 on Earth&#x27;s Gregorian calendar. New Year&#x27;s Day of MY38 coincided with 12 November 2024.

==Traditional and modern celebrations and customs==

===New Year&#x27;s Eve===

In the Gregorian calendar, New Year&#x27;s Eve, also known as Old Year&#x27;s Day, refers to the evening or the entire day of the last day of the year, 31 December. In many countries, New Year&#x27;s Eve is celebrated with dancing, eating, drinking, and watching or lighting fireworks. Some Christians attend a watchnight service to mark the occasion. The celebrations generally go on past midnight into New Year&#x27;s Day, 1 January.

The first places to welcome the New Year are the Line Islands (part of Kiribati), Samoa and Tonga, in the Pacific Ocean. In contrast, American Samoa, Baker Island and Howland Island (part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands) are among the last.

The first of January represents the fresh start of a new year after a period of remembrance of the passing year, including on radio, television, and in newspapers, which starts in early December in countries around the world. Publications have year-end articles that review the changes during the previous year. In some cases, publications may set their entire year&#x27;s work alight in the hope that the smoke emitted from the flame brings new life to the company. There are also articles on planned or expected changes in the coming year.

This day is traditionally a religious feast, but since the 1900s has also become an occasion to celebrate the night of 31 December—New Year&#x27;s Eve—with parties, public celebrations (often involving fireworks shows) and other traditions focused on the impending arrival of midnight and the new year. Watchnight services are also still observed by many.

===New Year&#x27;s Day===

The celebrations and activities held worldwide on 1 January as part of New Year&#x27;s Day commonly include the following:
* Pisan New Year&#x27;s Day celebrations was a particular type of calendar in use in Pisa, Italy, and other areas of present-day Tuscany until the mid-18th century, which started the year on 25 March (the feast of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary according to the liturgical calendar), anticipating its beginning by nine months and seven days compared to the &quot;modern style&quot; or &quot;Circumcision style&quot;, still in use today, which indicates 1 January as the first day of the year;
*Several major parades are held on New Year&#x27;s Day, including the London&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day Parade, Pasadena&#x27;s Tournament of Roses Parade (also known as the &quot;Rose Parade&quot;), and Philadelphia&#x27;s Mummers Parade. In the Bahamas, it is also associated with Junkanoos.
*Beginning in the 2010s, it is also the day that First Day Hikes takes place in the fifty state park systems of the United States.
*The Vienna Philharmonic orchestra traditionally performs a New Year&#x27;s concert on the morning of New Year&#x27;s Day.
*A &quot;polar bear plunge&quot; is a common tradition in some countries, where participants gather on beaches and run into the cold water. Polar Bear Clubs in many Northern Hemisphere cities have a tradition of holding organized plunges on New Year&#x27;s Day, and they are often held to raise money for charity.
*In Ireland, New Year&#x27;s Day was called &quot;Lá na gCeapairí&quot;, or the day of the buttered bread. A possible meaning to the consumption of buttered bread was to ward off hunger and famine in the coming year, by placing the buttered bread on the doorstep in the morning. Some traditions saw parties of young people calling from house to house to receive buttered bread and occasionally Poitín, or to give out buttered bread in exchange for pennies. This tradition has since died out, having been popular in the 19th century, and waning in the 1930s and 1940s.
*In Japan, Korea and areas inhabited by the Inuit, Yupik, Aleut, Chukchi and the Iñupiat, watching the first sunrise is a tradition.
*In the United Kingdom and United States, New Year&#x27;s Day is associated with several prominent sporting events:
**In the United States, 1 January is the traditional date for several major post-season college football bowl games, including the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, the Outback Bowl in Tampa, the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, and the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. Since 2015, the Rose and Sugar Bowl games host the semi-finals of the College Football Playoff every three seasons, and will otherwise host two of the newly established quarter-finals beginning in 2025. Since 2008, the National Hockey League has hosted an annual outdoor game, the &quot;Winter Classic&quot;, which rotates between different host teams annually, and usually showcases a major regional rivalry. If New Year&#x27;s Day falls on a Sunday, sporting events and associated festivities (such as the Rose Parade) traditionally held on New Year&#x27;s Day are typically deferred to the following Monday in defense of the National Football League—which plays a Sunday gameday as normal.
**The Premier League in English football traditionally holds a fixture of matches on New Year&#x27;s Day, stemming from the historic tradition of games being played over the Christmas holiday period (including, just as prominently, Boxing Day).
**The final of the PDC World Darts Championship typically falls on New Year&#x27;s Day.
**The Cheltenham Racecourse holds a New Year&#x27;s Day fixture, which includes the Fairlawne Handicap Chase, Dipper Novices&#x27; Chase, and Relkeel Hurdle.
*New Year&#x27;s Day is a government and bank holiday in many countries.
*In the Southern United States, a variety of foods considered lucky are cooked and consumed on New Year&#x27;s Day, including hopping John, red beans and rice, and collard greens.
*In Sweden, pizza orders spike with some pizzerias bringing in extra staff to handle a surge in demand. Swedish media have described it as &#x27;Pizza Day&#x27;.

===Music===
Music associated with New Year&#x27;s Day comes in both classical and popular genres, and there is also Christmas song focus on the arrival of a new year during the Christmas and holiday season.
*Paul Gerhardt wrote the text for a hymn for the turn of the year, &quot;Nun lasst uns gehn und treten&quot;, first published in 1653.
*Johann Sebastian Bach, in the Orgelbüchlein, composed three chorale preludes for the new year: &quot;Helft mir Gotts Güte preisen&quot; [&quot;Help me to praise God&#x27;s goodness&quot;] (BWV 613); &quot;Das alte Jahr vergangen ist&quot; [&quot;The old year has passed&quot;] (BWV 614); and &quot;In dir ist freude&quot; [&quot;In you is joy&quot;] (BWV 615).
*&quot;The year is gone, beyond recall&quot; is a traditional Christian hymn to give thanks for the new year, dating back to 1713.
*In English-speaking countries, it is traditional to sing Auld Lang Syne at midnight on New Year&#x27;s.

===New Year&#x27;s Day babies===
A common image used, often as an editorial cartoon, is that of an incarnation of Father Time (or &quot;the Old Year&quot;) wearing a sash across his chest with the previous year printed on it passing on his duties to the Baby New Year (or &quot;the New Year&quot;), an infant wearing a sash with the new year printed on it.

Babies born on New Year&#x27;s Day are commonly called &quot;New Year babies&quot;. Hospitals, such as the Dyersburg Regional Medical Center in the US, give out prizes to the first baby born in that hospital in the new year. These prizes are often donated by local businesses. Prizes may include various baby-related items such as baby formula, baby blankets, diapers, and gift certificates to stores which specialise in baby-related merchandise.

===Antarctica===
On New Year&#x27;s Day in Antarctica, the stake marking the geographic south pole is moved approximately 10 meters to compensate for the movement of the ice. A new marker stake is designed and made each year by staff at the site nearby.

==Other celebrations on 1 January==
The Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican Church and the Lutheran Church celebrate the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ on 1 January, based on the belief that if Jesus was born on 25 December, then according to Hebrew tradition, his circumcision would have taken place on the eighth day of his life (1 January). The Roman Catholic Church celebrates on this day the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, which is also a Holy Day of Obligation.

Johann Sebastian Bach composed several church cantatas for the double occasion:
*&quot;Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied&quot;, BWV 190, 1 January 1724
*&quot;Jesu, nun sei gepreiset&quot;, BWV 41, 1 January 1725
*&quot;Herr Gott, dich loben wir&quot;, BWV 16, 1 January 1726
*&quot;Gott, wie dein Name, so ist auch dein Ruhm&quot;, BWV 171, 1 January 1729(?)
*&quot;Fallt mit Danken, fallt mit Loben&quot;, 1 January 1735 (&quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; Part IV)

<text>Richard Peter Stanislav Krajicek (; born 6 December 1971) is a Dutch former professional tennis player and tournament director. Krajicek won 17 singles titles during his career, including the 1996 Wimbledon Championships, becoming the first (and only) Dutchman to win a major singles title. He was ranked world No. 4 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) in March 1999. Retiring from the sport in 2003, Krajicek has been the tournament director of the Rotterdam Open since 2004. He is also the author of various sports books.

==Personal life==
Richard Krajicek is the son of Czech immigrants. In the nineties Krajicek had a relationship with Italian actress and model Lory Del Santo, with whom he had a son who was born prematurely and died of an infection after two weeks of life. In 1999, he married model, writer and hostess of Holland&#x27;s Next Top Model and Benelux&#x27;s Next Top Model, Daphne Deckers, with whom he lives in Muiderberg and has two children (a son and a daughter). Nicknamed &quot;de Kraai&quot; (Dutch for &quot;the crow&quot;) in his home country, one of Krajicek&#x27;s siblings is Michaëlla Krajicek, a half-sister and fellow tennis professional. A distant cousin of his is another tennis player, the American Austin Krajicek.

Krajicek is a member of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), a political party in the Netherlands.

==Career==
Richard Krajicek began playing tennis at the age of four. As a youngster he won both the Dutch under-12 and the under-14 National Championships twice. His biggest achievement as a youngster was winning the Wiltshire Open in the UK after beating Steven White in straight sets in the final. He turned professional in 1989, and in 1991 won his first top-level singles title in Hong Kong and his first tour doubles title at the Dutch Open.

In 1992, the Dutchman reached his first Grand Slam semi-finals at the Australian Open. He had to withdraw from this semi-final match due to a shoulder injury. The next year, he reached the semi-finals at the French Open, where he lost in four sets to the defending champion Jim Courier. Also in 1992, Krajicek made a controversial comment regarding equal pay for women in Grand Slam events, saying, &quot;Eighty percent of the top 100 women are fat pigs who don&#x27;t deserve equal pay.&quot; Later, he jokingly clarified his comments, remarking, &quot;What I meant to say was that only 75 percent are fat pigs.&quot;

At the 1996 Italian Open, Krajicek reached the final, before losing in four sets to the reigning champion, Thomas Muster. At the French Open later that year, Krajicek was the only player to take a set off the eventual champion, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, during their quarterfinal match.

Coming into 1996 Wimbledon, Krajicek had never previously progressed beyond the fourth round at the tournament and had lost in the first round in the two previous years. He was seen as a player with potential, having one of the fastest serves at the time, but was not considered to be a strong contender for the title. The clear favourite was Pete Sampras, who had won the title for the past three consecutive years. Despite being ranked within the world&#x27;s top 16, Krajicek just missed out on the seedings for the tournament, but when seventh seed (and world No. 2) Thomas Muster pulled out shortly before the tournament due to an injury, Krajicek was declared the 17th seed and moved to Muster&#x27;s place in the draw. Opinions differ, therefore, on whether he won the tournament as an unseeded player.

He beat former champion Michael Stich in the fourth round and met Sampras in the quarterfinals. By that time, he had managed to turn his notably weak slice backhand into an aggressive top-spin shot. Krajicek defeated Sampras in straight sets, becoming the only player to beat Sampras in a Wimbledon singles match in the eight-year period from 1993 until Sampras&#x27;s fourth-round loss to Roger Federer in 2001. Next, he beat Australia&#x27;s Jason Stoltenberg in the semi-finals, and went on to face American MaliVai Washington in the final. He won the final in straight sets to become the first Dutchman to win Wimbledon.

In 1997, Krajicek&#x27;s defence of his Wimbledon title ended in the fourth round, when Tim Henman defeated him in four sets.

In 1998, Krajicek was in the Wimbledon semi-finals again, losing to Goran Ivanišević in a marathon match, 13–15 in the fifth set, with both players serving a combined 38 aces. His final attempt at a Wimbledon title was in 2002, when he lost in the quarterfinals to Xavier Malisse. Krajicek beat world No. 5 Andre Agassi, world No. 1 Sampras and world No. 9 Yevgeny Kafelnikov on his way to the Stuttgart Masters title in November.

At the 1999 US Open, Krajicek lost a quarterfinal matchup to Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Despite the loss, he set several most aces records that day. In the 2000 U.S. Open, Krajicek met Sampras in the quarterfinals, winning the first set and going up 6–2 during the second-set tiebreaker, but then losing six straight points and the match. In 2000, Krajicek was awarded the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award for his efforts to help youth in his home country. He was named ATP Comeback Player of the Year in 2002.

Krajicek retired from the professional tour in 2003. During his career, he won 17 singles titles and three doubles titles. His career-high singles ranking was world No. 4 in 1999. Krajicek&#x27;s Wimbledon victory over Sampras proved to be no fluke, since he ended his career with a 6–4 record against the American player.

Since retiring from the ATP Tour, Krajicek runs The Richard Krajicek Foundation, which builds sports facilities for children in inner-city areas in the Netherlands. In 2004, Krajicek became the tournament director of the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam.

In 2005, he published a book on tennis, &quot;Fast Balls&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Harde Ballen&quot;).

<doc id="161973" wikidata="Q2798912" url="?curid=161973" title="Accountability">
<text>Accountability, in terms of ethics and governance, is equated with answerability, culpability, liability, and the expectation of account-giving.

As in an aspect of governance, it has been central to discussions related to problems in the public sector, nonprofit, private (corporate), and individual contexts. In leadership roles, accountability is the acknowledgment of and assumption of responsibility for actions, products, decisions, and policies such as administration, governance, and implementation, including the obligation to report, justify, and be answerable for resulting consequences.

In governance, accountability has expanded beyond the basic definition of &quot;being called to account for one&#x27;s actions&quot;. It is frequently described as an account-giving relationship between individuals, e.g. &quot;A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about A&#x27;s (past or future) actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct.&quot;

Accountability cannot exist without proper accounting practices; in other words, an absence of accounting means an absence of accountability. Another key area that contributes to accountability is good records management.

==History and etymology==
&quot;Accountability&quot; derives from the late Latin (to account), a prefixed form of (to calculate), which in turn is derived from (to reckon). While the word itself does not appear in English until its use in 13th century Norman England, the concept of account-giving has ancient roots in record-keeping activities related to governance and money-lending systems that first developed in Ancient Egypt, Israel, Babylon, Greece, and later Rome.

== Political accountability==
Political accountability is when a politician makes choices on behalf of the people, and the people have the ability to reward or sanction the politician. In representative democracies, citizens delegate power to elected officials through periodic elections, and such officials are empowered to represent or act in the citizens&#x27; interest. A challenge is how to see to it that those with such power, who presumably have divergent interests from the citizens, nonetheless act in their best interests. Citizens can rely on rewards or sanctions to reward or threaten politicians who might otherwise act in a manner that is antithetical to the people&#x27;s interest. Accountability occurs when citizens only vote to re-elect representatives who act in their interests, and if representatives then select policies that will help them be re-elected. &quot;Governments are &#x27;accountable&#x27; if voters can discern whether governments are acting in their interest and sanction them appropriately, so that those incumbents who act in the best interest of the citizens win reelection and those who do not lose them.&quot;

Representatives can be held accountable through two mechanisms: electoral replacement and rational anticipation. In electoral replacement, citizens vote to replace representatives who are out of step with their interests. Rational anticipation requires that representatives anticipate the consequences of being out of step with their constituency and then govern in accordance with citizens&#x27; wishes to avoid negative consequences. Accountability can still be achieved even if citizens are not perfectly knowledgeable about their representatives&#x27; actions; as long as representatives believe that they will be held accountable by citizens, they will still be motivated to act in accordance with the citizens&#x27; interests.

=== Electoral accountability===
Electoral accountability refers to citizens using their vote to sanction or reward politicians.

Some researchers have considered accountability using formal theory, which makes assumptions about the state of the world to draw larger conclusions. Voters can hold representatives accountable through the process of sanctioning—voting the incumbent out of office in response to poor performance. While politicians face a decrease in vote share as a result of poor performance, they are less likely to see an increase in vote share for good performance. Selection—voters choosing candidates based on who will best represent their interests—is another method by which voters hold their representatives accountable. These methods of accountability can occur simultaneously, with voters holding representatives accountable using both sanctioning and selection. These conclusions rely on the assumption that voters do not observe the policy implemented by the incumbent, but do know their own welfare.

Some factors make it harder for voters to sanction incumbents. When politicians do not have control over outcomes, it becomes harder to hold them accountable. Additionally, when organizations are unable to monitor elections and provide information to voters, then voters struggle to sanction the incumbent. When voters are better informed about the incumbent&#x27;s performance, the incumbent is more vulnerable to voter sanctioning. Furthermore, when incumbents face sanctioning, challengers are more likely to enter the race.

While elections provide a mechanism which can theoretically increase government accountability to citizens, they may instead lead to less egalitarian policy outcomes, because those who hold the government accountable tend to be from wealthier segments of society. For example, a study of elected versus appointed property assessors in the state of New York shows that the election of property assessors leads to policies that severely undertax wealthier homes relative to poorer homes.

Studies on political accountability have emphasized the key role of elections in promoting accountability in democratic settings. It is through elections that citizens hold governments accountable for past performance. 

==== Electoral manipulation ====

The role of elections in fostering accountability is often undermined by electoral manipulation and fraud. By preventing citizens from removing leaders through elections based on their performance in office, electoral manipulation breaks down accountability and may undercut the consolidation of democratic institutions.

Electoral manipulation is not rare; some estimates are that in the 1990s and 2000s, up to one fourth of elections suffered some form of substantial manipulation. This includes a large array of pre-election and election-day tactics, such as outlawing rival parties and candidates, employing violence and intimidation, and manipulating voter registration and vote count. Some efforts to improve accountability by preventing electoral manipulation and fraud have obtained a certain measure of success, such as using cell phone applications for monitoring and disseminating polling station results and employing domestic or international election observers. However, governments may simply alter the type of manipulation or where it occurs in order to deceive observers and monitoring agencies.

Governments, politicians, and political parties are more likely to resort to electoral manipulation and fraud when they believe they might be removed from office and when they face few institutional constraints to their power. Low political competition has also been linked to some forms of manipulation, such as abolishing presidential term limits. Well-connected candidates are more likely to resort to vote count fraud. Governments may engage in electoral manipulation not only to obtain victory at a given election or to remain in office longer, but also for post-election reasons, such as reducing the strength of the opposition or increasing their own bargaining power in the subsequent period.

=== Administrative ===
==== Public goods ====
Politicians may be incentivized to provide public goods as a means of accountability. The ability of voters to attribute the credit and blame of outcomes also determines the extent of public goods provision. Research suggests that public goods provision being able to attribute outcomes to politicians as opposed to civil servants. This attribution can be enhanced by more short-run and visible inputs and outcomes such as famine relief or access to drinking water, whereas lower-visibility issues such as sanitation and education may be more difficult to attribute credit for and thus less likely to provide for.

Another condition determining how voters use the provision of public goods to hold leaders accountable is whether the prioritization of public goods is determined either directly via vote or delegated to a governing body. An experiment in New Mexico regarding proposed spending during the state&#x27;s 2008 special summer legislative session provides evidence that legislators update their positions when learning about voters&#x27; policy preferences, indicating that a representative democracy can increase accountability when politicians learn about voters&#x27; preferences. A 2016 experiment in Afghanistan regarding rural development projects, however, finds that when voters directly prioritize their preferences at the ballot box, they perceive the quality of local government to be higher than when a governing committee prioritizes development projects. These contrasting outcomes highlight a debate between trustees and delegates, though the lack of objective superior outcomes in projects decided by vote as opposed to committee in the Afghanistan experiment indicate neither is superior to the other in determining which public goods should be given priority.

Other research indicates that voters use elections to hold politicians accountable for the provision of public goods. In India, rural areas are charged a flat rate for electricity, but in the province of Uttar Pradesh, line loss—electricity that is consumed but not billed—is significantly higher in election years than non-election years, and increases in line loss reliably predict electoral gains. Voters rewarded incumbent politicians with a 12% increase in party seats in response to a 10% increase of unbilled electricity, in 2007 elections. In Ghana, the improvement of road conditions is linked to an increasing vote share for incumbent parties. Both of these research outcomes hinge on voters being able to attribute the service of public goods to politicians.

Politicians may also have incentives to respond to pressure for public goods provision in electoral autocracies. There is evidence that as autocratic governments lose seats in their party&#x27;s legislatures, they respond by increasing spending on public goods such as education, healthcare, and pensions. There is further evidence suggesting higher quality of life, civil liberties, and human development in electoral autocracies, lending credence to the theory that autocratic rulers use elections as a bellwether against popular discontent and citizen opposition, and in turn increase public goods provision to dampen the grievances of disgruntled citizens, even in non-democracies.

While the introduction of elections is generally thought to improve public goods provision, in some cases, researchers have shown that it may reduce its quality. For example, the introduction of direct elections for local district office in Indonesia resulted in political interference in the hiring process for bureaucrats in the public education sector, reducing the quality of education provision; politicians were incentivized to dole out patronage positions in the education sector, especially in election years, and where such positions were added, student test scores were lower.

== Non-electoral ==
Governments are held accountable if citizens can punish or reward the government to influence it to pursue their best interests. While scholars who study democratic theory emphasize the role of elections in ensuring accountability, another strand of scholars investigates non-electoral forms of accountability in democracies and non-democracies and the conditions that make unelected leaders represent the interests of the general public.

=== Political protests ===
Political changes after protests can be the result of the protests &quot;per se&quot;, or symptoms of shifts in political preferences underneath the observable phenomena of the protests. One study of the Tea Party movement in the United States has shown that protests &quot;per se&quot; have an impact on political change.

Other scholars studied the effect of protests on political changes in developing countries. Mass protests instigated by economic hardship and political repression occurred in 16 sub-Saharan African countries, and 21 governments in the region implemented significant political reforms, such as the adoption of multi-party elections. Authoritarian regimes in Africa distorted the market and reduced the cost of farm produce in favor of urban workers at the cost of rural farmers in the 1980s to prevent urban unrest, which is more visible and easier to mobilize than rural protests.

=== Selectorates ===
Belsky &quot;et al.&quot; point out that whereas, under more democratic governance, accountability is built into the institution of the state by a habit of regular elections, accountability in autocratic regimes relies on a selectorate—a group that legitimizes or delegitimizes the autocrat&#x27;s powers according to selectorate theory. Selectorates are those on whom a leader depends in order to hold onto power, and those who have the ability to depose a leader. When a selectorate&#x27;s hold on power is not overly dependent on the leader in office, selectorates can remove poorly performing leaders, and this accountability by selectorates renders it possible for autocracies to perform better for the benefit of all. Beyond that, institutions can act as credible restraints on autocracy as well.

=== Civil societies ===
In democracies, voluntary associations, interest groups, and associational activity can improve the performance of the government. One study showed that civil society organizations such as NGOs can increase the performance of local government according to the central government&#x27;s standards by monitoring and disclosing information about local government performance in authoritarian regimes like China. Solidarity groups in rural China, in which members share moral obligations and interests, can hold local officials accountable as well when (i) the solidarity group encompasses everyone under the local government&#x27;s jurisdiction, and (ii) local officials are embedded in the group as members. The social standing and recognition of these groups encourages local officials to perform well, as they value high moral standing in the group.

At the local level, various accountability measures exist that impact the job performance of elected officials. In Uganda, civil society organizations (CSOs) that divulge to the public how well an incumbent is performing their job duties, in a district with an upcoming competitive election, increase the performance of the politician for the rest of their term. In contrast to these works, a meta-analysis released in 2019 uncovers no effects from CSO voter information campaigns on political accountability after examining the results from seven trials across six countries. In Ghana, election-day monitoring of polling centers for district-level positions, as well as an increase in the awareness of monitoring in an upcoming election, increases job performance among incumbents, who spend more of their annual Constituency Development Fund allocations from the central government on public goods for the electorate. In locales with weaker institutions, when citizens elect leaders with higher levels of competency, these officials have a greater ability to overcome the barriers of bad informal institutions, and deliver more goods and long-term investment projects for the constituency without needing to raise taxes. Additionally, many local elections are for positions that involve performing jobs with a single function, such as a school board member or a sheriff. These elected officials are held accountable to their positions mainly through information provided to the public through the media. When the media focuses attention on data trends associated with these positions, constituents are then able to use this information to retrospectively vote for or against an incumbent based on their performance in office.

=== Public opinion polls ===
Approval ratings generated through public opinion polling create a measure of job performance during an incumbent&#x27;s term that has implications for whether the official will retain their seat, or if reelection will even be sought. These approval ratings predict election outcomes when combined with other factors included in Bayesian Model Averaging forecasts. In the United States, senator job approval ratings affect whether a senator will retire, the quality of candidates that seek to challenge them, the amount of money the senator can raise to seek reelection if they decide to run, and the outcome of the election itself. Strategic incumbent senators will seek reelection less when their approval ratings are low during their time in office.
=== Shared interests ===
Traditional leaders in Zambia provide local public goods despite the fact that they lack an electoral incentive to do so. Many customary chiefs never leave the communities they lead and depend on local sources for a significant portion of their income; thus, traditional leaders may facilitate bringing in local public goods and benefit from the community&#x27;s development over time just like stationary bandits in Olson&#x27;s argument.

== Accountability and corruption ==
Political corruption refers to &quot;the misuse or the abuse of public office for private gains&quot;. Corrupt practices include fraud, appropriation of public funds, and accepting bribes. Corruption can cause people to negatively evaluate politicians, since citizens may perceive corruption as a signal of poor performance, motivating them to sanction an incumbent. As the model of retrospective voting suggests that voters incentivize good politicians&#x27; behavior by rewarding good performance and punishing bad performance, citizens are expected to sanction corrupt politicians. However, studies suggest that though voters have a distaste for corruption, they often fail to punish corrupt incumbents; some of them receive benefits from their representatives&#x27; corrupt practices, and prefer to retain this type of politician. In high-corruption contexts, voters may become more tolerant of or even prefer corrupt politicians because others are also perceived as corrupt, leading to a corrupt equilibrium &quot;where voters are generally willing to retain corrupt politicians&quot;, referred to as a &quot;political corruption trap&quot;. This high corruption equilibrium is difficult to break due to interaction between corrupt politicians, voters who tolerate and retain corrupt politicians, and potential entrants or challengers who also engage in corrupt practices, leading to the maintenance of corruption. Economic development is associated with a decrease in corruption. Freedom of the press contributes to the reduction of corruption by exposing corrupt actions. Documentation on how a corrupt government (e.g. Alberto Fujimori&#x27;s government from 1998 to 2000 in Peru) can strategically undermine checks-and-balances institutions, suggests that the news media—i.e. newspapers and mainly television—is crucial to the dissemination of information to the public. There is also evidence about the importance of local media, such as local radio stations, in holding corrupt incumbents accountable and in promoting non-corrupt politicians. Information about corruption may not only lead to vote losses for the incumbent parties, but also for challenging parties, as well the erosion of partisan attachments, which implies that information about corruption also provokes citizens&#x27; disengagement from the political process.

Scholarly literature about corruption finds mixed results about the role of political institutions on the level of a country&#x27;s corruption. For example, some scholarly research suggests that more horizontal accountability, or oversight across branches of government, would generally decrease corruption. However, other research shows that increased oversight could increase corruption when actors in one branch can pressure actors in another to collude; in Ghana, bureaucrats are more likely to engage in corruption on behalf of politicians when politicians have higher levels of discretion to oversee the bureaucracy (e.g., by threatening to transfer noncompliant bureaucrats).

Low accountability for corruption is difficult to combat, and some anti-corruption activities may also lead to perverse consequences. For example, in places where private sector work pays better than public sector work (e.g., China), highly qualified individuals engaging in public sector work may only find such work attractive because it allows for further compensation through corrupt activities. Government anti-corruption activities can therefore decrease the quality and overall representativeness of the bureaucracy as a result. On the other hand, there is evidence that, despite strategic evasion and unintentional consequences, anti-corruption initiatives are beneficial, as they lower malfeasance and increase social welfare, even where strategic evasion is relatively large.

== Police accountability ==

== Organizational ==
===Ethical===
Within an organization, the principles and practices of ethical accountability aim to improve both the internal standard of individual and group conduct as well as external factors, such as sustainable economic and ecologic strategies. Also, ethical accountability plays an important role in academic fields, such as laboratory experiments and field research. Debates around the practice of ethical accountability on the part of researchers in – whether professional or others – were explored by Norma R.A. Romm in her work on &quot;Accountability in Social Research&quot;, and elsewhere. Researcher accountability implies that researchers are cognizant of, and take some responsibility for, the potential impact of their ways of doing research – and of writing it up – on the social fields of which the research is part. Accountability is linked to considering carefully, and being open to challenge in relation to, one&#x27;s choices concerning how research agendas are framed and the styles in which research results are written.

=== Security ===
The traceability of actions performed on a system to a specific system entity (user, process, device) also affects accountability. For example, the use of unique user identification and authentication supports accountability, and the use of shared user IDs and passwords degrades accountability.

===Individuals within organizations===
Because many individuals in large organizations contribute in many ways to decisions and policies, it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results. This is what is known, following Dennis F. Thompson, as &quot;the problem of many hands&quot;. It creates a dilemma for accountability. If individuals are held accountable or responsible, individuals who could not have prevented the results are either unfairly punished, or they &quot;take responsibility&quot; in a symbolic ritual without suffering any consequences. If only organizations are held accountable, then all individuals in the organization are equally blameworthy or all are excused.

Various solutions have been proposed. One is to broaden the criteria for individual responsibility so that individuals are held accountable for not anticipating failures in the organization. Another solution, recently proposed by Thompson, is to hold individuals accountable for the design of the organization, both retrospectively and prospectively.

Accountability is an element of a responsibility assignment matrix which indicates who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of a deliverable or task, as well as the delegation of the work to those responsible.

===Public and private overlap===
With the increase in public service provided by private entities, especially in Britain and the United States, some have called for increased political accountability mechanisms for otherwise non-political entities. Legal scholar Anne Davies, for instance, argues that the line between public institutions and private entities like corporations is becoming blurred in certain areas of public service in the United Kingdom, and that this can compromise political accountability in those areas. She and others argue that some administrative law reform is necessary to address this accountability gap.

With respect to the public/private overlap in the United States, public concern over the contracting of government services (including military) and the resulting accountability gap was highlighted following the Nisour Square massacre perpetrated by the Blackwater security firm in Iraq.

== In education ==
As defined by National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), accountability is &quot;[a] program, often legislated, that attributes the responsibility for student learning to teachers, school administrators, or students. Test results typically are used to judge accountability, and often consequences are imposed for shortcomings.&quot;

Student accountability is traditionally based on school and classroom rules, combined with sanctions for infringement.

In contrast, some educational establishments such as Sudbury schools believe that students are personally responsible for their acts, and that traditional schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action are considered the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Sudbury schools claim that Ethics&#x27; is a course taught by life experience&quot;. They adduce that the essential ingredient for acquiring values—and for moral action—is personal responsibility, that schools will become involved in the teaching of morals when they become communities of people who fully respect each other&#x27;s right to make choices, and that the only way the schools can become meaningful purveyors of ethical values is if they provide students and adults with real-life experiences that are bearers of moral import. Students are given complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a direct democracy in which students and staff are equals.

==Media and accountability==

Econometric research has found that Greater political accountability and lower corruption were more likely where newspaper consumption was higher, according to data from roughly 100 countries and from different states in the US. Congressmen who receive less press coverage are less likely to produce a positive impact for their constituencies, are less likely to congressional hearings, and federal spending for their district is lower. One explanation for the positive impact of media on accountability stems from Besley and Burgess&#x27; work. They argue that media resolves the information asymmetries between citizens and government and provides a way of overcoming obstacles preventing political action. When elected officials and the public gain information, the public is better equipped to hold politicians accountable and politicians are more responsive. Ferraz &amp; Finan demonstrate this in the Brazilian context. In their work, they find releasing audit reports prior to elections creates a more informed electorate which holds incumbent officials accountable.

While evidence supports the positive impact of press freedom on political accountability, other work highlights the significance of factors such as media concentration and ownership as government tools for influencing or controlling news content. Non-democratic regimes use media for a variety of purposes such as – (i) to enhance regime resilience, (ii) censor, or (iii) strategically distract the public. Control of the media may also be especially beneficial to incumbents in new or developing democracies, who consider media control a spoil of office.

An analysis of the evolution of mass media in the U.S. and Europe since World War II noted mixed results from the growth of the Internet: &quot;The digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression [and] information [but] has had mixed effects on freedom of the press&quot;: It has disrupted traditional sources of funding, and new forms of Internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what&#x27;s been lost. Various systems have been proposed for increasing the funds available for investigative journalism that allow individual citizens to direct small amounts of government funds to news outlets or investigative journalism projects of their choice.

==Standards==
Accountability standards have been established that organizations can voluntarily commit to. Standards apply in particular to the non-profit world and to Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. Accountability standards include the:
; INGO Accountability Charter: signed by a large number of NGOs to &quot;demonstrate their commitment to accountability and transparency&quot;
; AccountAbility&#x27;s AA1000 series: &quot;principles-based standards to help organisations become more accountable, responsible and sustainable. They address issues affecting governance, business models and organizational strategy, as well as providing operational guidance on sustainability assurance and stakeholder engagement&quot;
; Humanitarian Accountability Partnership 2010 standards: for humanitarian organizations to help them &quot;design, implement, assess, improve and recognize accountable programmes&quot;
In addition, some non-profit organizations set up their own commitments to accountability:
; Accountability, Learning and Planning System (ALPS) by ActionAid: a framework that sets out key accountability requirements, guidelines, and processes

<doc id="161974" wikidata="Q2364018" url="?curid=161974" title="A Shock to the System (1990 film)">
<text>A Shock to the System is a 1990 American black comedy film directed by Jan Egleson and starring Michael Caine, Swoosie Kurtz, Elizabeth McGovern, and Peter Riegert. It is based on the 1984 novel &quot;A Shock to the System&quot; by British author Simon Brett.

The film was released on March 23, 1990 and received generally positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Graham Marshall, a long-time executive in a large advertising company, is unexpectedly passed over for promotion in favor of his obnoxious younger rival Bob Benham. While he sympathizes with his friend George Brewster, whose dismissal in the midst of a corporate takeover created the open position, Marshall is angry and disappointed. His greedy, self-absorbed wife Leslie is devastated and continually reproaches her husband for his apparent lack of ambition and willpower.

The night of the missed promotion, Graham is waiting for his train on the subway. An aggressive panhandler harasses him for being so rich and ungenerous. In a fit of rage, Graham pushes him hard enough that he falls on the subway tracks and gets run over by an oncoming train. Marshall is able to leave unobserved, which unexpectedly elates him.

Deciding to take revenge on the people who have made his life miserable, Marshall starts meticulously planning their deaths. Recalling an incident in which he was almost fatally electrocuted by faulty wiring in his basement, he arranges for Leslie to have a similar accident. After her death, he gets more ambitious and plans to get rid of Bob. First he rents a car using George&#x27;s corporate account and procures a bottle of heavy downers from an office courier who deals drugs. While on a date with Stella Anderson, a female employee who is romantically interested in him, he spikes her drink with some of the downers and waits until she passes out. Driving the rental car to Bob&#x27;s boat, he booby-traps it by tampering with a natural gas tank and taping some matches to the door. While returning home, he victoriously lights a cigar and absent-mindedly leaves his personalized gold plated lighter on the dashboard before returning the car to the dealer and going home. The next morning Stella wakes up as expected and assumes she blacked out after having slept with Graham. They spend the morning having sex to further cement Graham&#x27;s alibi. Bob and one of his brown-nosing subordinates board his boat; opening the door, they ignite the gas tank and blow themselves up. In the wake of Bob&#x27;s death his boss, Mr. Jones, reaches out to Graham and offers him the promotion. He accepts it and, while discussing Bob&#x27;s death, Jones casually mentions his interest in flying planes.

As Graham settles into his new position, life becomes increasingly hectic. Police Lieutenant Laker, assigned to all the deaths surrounding Graham, is quickly convinced of his guilt but lacks any evidence. Graham realizes his lighter has gone missing and slowly realizes that he must have left it in the rental car. Interviewed by Laker, Stella begins to suspect that Graham really is a killer. She retrieves the lighter from the car rental company and plans to meet Laker on the same subway platform where Graham earlier killed the panhandler. Graham finds her first and, during a tense confrontation, he appears to contemplate pushing her onto the tracks. However, after expressing her deep disappointment with him, Stella hands over the lighter and leaves without further incident. As Graham exits the subway station, he runs into Lt. Laker and victoriously lights a cigar with his retrieved lighter right in his face. Without evidence, Laker has no choice but to let Graham go. Meanwhile George, intensely depressed about his forced retirement, finds Graham&#x27;s stash of downers and kills himself by taking the rest of them all at once, not realizing his knowledge of the car rental on his corporate account could have implicated Graham.

Graham revels in his newfound prestige and freedom, having eliminated all his enemies and gotten away with it, while ensuring Stella&#x27;s silence by transferring her to Los Angeles. However, there is one more tiresome detail to deal with: Jones refuses to give up his corner office. As Graham continues to narrate, Jones&#x27;s plane is seen flying over some tropical islands, before encountering sudden engine trouble. The movie ends with the sound of an explosion and Graham looking satisfied with himself.

== Difference from the novel ==

The movie plot differs somewhat from the novel. In the novel, Graham kills the panhandler by clobbering him to death with an umbrella and throwing his body off a bridge into a river below. Then when he tries to kill his wife, he begins with a failed attempt involving him awkwardly buying some poison from a garden centre after acting very suspicious and lacing a sherry bottle that his wife drinks constantly from with it so she will drink it and die. However, it turns the sherry blue and it smells terrible and he knows there&#x27;s no way she would ever drink it, so he abandons the idea and stashes the bottle in his shed. Then he kills his wife the same way as the movie and kills his boss the same way as the movie (even though his brown-nosing subordinate survives the explosion with only some scars on his face and then proceeds to brown-nose Graham once he gets the promotion). His missing lighter gets resolved differently by his old boss George getting it since the car was rented in his name. He gives it back to Graham without realizing how damning it could have been to the police and Graham silences him by pushing him in front of a subway train to make sure he never talks to anyone else about it.

Both the novel and movie end with Graham getting away with all of his killings. However, the novel then throws a final twist of irony at the end. There&#x27;s a subplot featuring his mother-in-law, who is certain that Graham killed her daughter and is persistently trying to prove it. After Graham taunts her with the knowledge that he will never be prosecuted for it, he returns home from work one day to find Lt Laker preparing to arrest him. It turns out his mother-in-law found the poison laced sherry bottle in his shed and she drank it and made a big show in front of his neighbors about how he tricked her into drinking it before dropping dead in front of everybody. That combined with the garden centre employee testifying about how awkward he acted when he bought the poison and a scorned Stella falsely testifying about the time Graham left his home, it looks very bad for Graham. After getting away with 4 murders, he is about to be arrested for a murder he did not commit.

== Production ==
The film was shot in New York City between May 22 and July 28, 1989, on a $10 million budget. Scenes were shot at Wall Street Plaza and Grand Central Terminal. The sailboat scenes were filmed on Lake Montauk.

According to Corsair Pictures executive Frank Perry, the screenplay originally ended with the character of Graham Marshall being killed off but was rewritten because of Caine&#x27;s performance. A satisfactory ending to the film was not written until the fifth week of filming. The director Jan Egleson ultimately shot three different endings to the film, with the final version not being selected until editing during post-production.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 71% based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Aided by Michael Caine&#x27;s finely layered performance, &quot;A Shock to the System&quot; finds dark comedy in the cutthroat modern business world.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing: &quot;&quot;A Shock to the System&quot; confounds our expectations and keeps us intrigued, because there&#x27;s no way to know, not even in the very last moments, exactly which way the plot is going to fall.&quot;

Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote about A Shock to the System &quot;the plot has a couple of holes in it but Caine breezes along as if it didn&#x27;t. The most notable fact about the picture is that the protagonist is an egocentric murderer (perhaps the adjective is superfluous), with no jot of sympathy in him; yet a considerable star accepted the role. That in itself is a small sociocultural marker. What&#x27;s even more remarkable is that Caine&#x27;s believe ability—not by tugging at our hearts—is able to make us hope that he succeeds with his wickedness.

<text>In law, a judgment is a decision of a court regarding the rights and liabilities of parties in a legal action or proceeding. Judgments also generally provide the court&#x27;s explanation of why it has chosen to make a particular court order.

Speakers of British English tend to use the term at the appellate level as synonymous with judicial opinion. American English speakers prefer to maintain a clear distinction between the &quot;opinion&quot; of an appellate court (setting forth reasons for the disposition of an appeal) and the &quot;judgment&quot; of an appellate court (the pronouncement of the disposition itself). 

In Canadian English, the phrase &quot;reasons for judgment&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;judgment,&quot; although the former refers to the court&#x27;s justification of its judgment while the latter refers to the final court order regarding the rights and liabilities of the parties. 

== Spelling ==
Judgment is considered a &quot;free variation&quot; word, and the use of either &quot;judgment&quot; or &quot;judgement&quot; (with an e) is considered acceptable. This variation arises depending on the country and the use of the word in a legal or non-legal context. British, Australian, New Zealand, American, and Canadian English generally use &quot;judgment&quot; when referring to a court&#x27;s formal ruling. &quot;Judgement&quot; is commonly used in the United Kingdom when referring to a non-legal decision. Translations from non-English texts demonstrate varied spelling of the word. For instance, the English translation of France&#x27;s &quot;Code of Civil Procedure&quot; uses &quot;judgement&quot; throughout.

== Who renders a judgment ==

The legal definition of &quot;judgment&quot; contemplates decisions made by judges in a court of law. Decisions of quasi-judicial bodies and administrative bodies may also be colloquially referred to as &quot;judgments,&quot; but they must be distinguished from true judgments in that they are not made by judges in courts of law. Judgments must also be distinguished from arbitral awards, which are made by arbitral tribunals.

== Form of judgments ==

A judgment may be provided either in written or oral form depending on the circumstances.

Oral judgments are often provided at the conclusion of a hearing and are frequently used by courts with heavier caseloads or where a judgment must be rendered quickly.

Written reasons for judgment are often provided in circumstances where a complex decision must be made, where the matter is likely to be appealed, or where the decision is considered to be of some significant importance to members of the legal community and/or the public at large. Written reasons for judgment are not generally provided immediately following the hearing and may take days, weeks, or even months to be released.

== Types of judgments ==
Types of judgments can be distinguished on a number of grounds, including the procedures the parties must follow to obtain the judgment, the issues the court will consider before rendering the judgment, and the effect of the judgment. Judgments that vary from a standard judgment on the merits of a case include the following:

* Consent judgment: also referred to as an &quot;agreed judgment&quot;, a consent judgment is a settlement agreed upon by the parties and authorized by a judge. Consent judgments are often used in the regulatory context, particularly in antitrust and environmental cases.
* Declaratory judgment: a judgment that determines the rights and liabilities of the parties without enforcing a judgment or otherwise requiring the parties to do anything. A declaratory judgment may be useful where the parties have differing views about their rights and duties or are wishing to clarify them without seeking any other remedy. It has been suggested, at least in the United States, that a declaratory judgment is a &quot;milder&quot; form of an injunction order because it clarifies the parties&#x27; rights without actually directing the parties to do anything. Though a declaratory judgment is not binding, it is expected that the parties will act in accordance with what the court determines in its judgment.
* Default judgment: a judgment rendered in favour of one party based on the other party&#x27;s failure to take action. Default judgments are commonly used where the defendant fails to appear before the court or submit a defence after being summoned. A default judgment grants the relief requested by the appearing party and does not require extensive factual or legal analysis from the court.
* Interlocutory judgment: an intermediate or interim judgment providing a temporary decision on an issue that requires timely action. Interlocutory orders are not final and may either not be subject to appeal or may follow a different appeal procedure than other kinds of judgments.
* Reserved judgment or reserved decision: a judgment that is not given immediately after the conclusion of the hearing or trial. A reserved judgment may be released days, weeks, or even months after the hearing. In the United States, a reserved judgment is sometimes annotated in law reports by the Latin phrase &quot;Cur. adv. vult.&quot; or &quot;c.a.v.&quot; (&quot;Curia advisari vult, &quot;&quot;the court wishes to be advised&quot;).
* Summary judgment: an accelerated judgment that does not require a trial and in which the court&#x27;s interpretation of the pleadings forms the basis of the judgment. For a summary judgment, the court will consider &quot;the contents of the pleadings, the motions, and additional evidence adduced by the parties to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact rather than one of law.&quot;
* Vacated judgment: a judgment of an appellate court whereby the judgment under review is set aside and a new trial is ordered. A vacated judgment is rendered where the original judgment failed to make an order in accordance with the law and a new trial is ordered to ensure a just outcome. The process of vacating a judgment is sometimes referred to as vacatur. The result of a vacated judgment is a trial de novo.

== Opinions within judgments ==
If more than one judge is deciding a case, the judgment may be delivered unanimously or it may be divided into a number of majority, concurring, plurality, and dissenting opinions. Only the opinion of the majority judgment is considered to have precedent-setting weight. Some examples of opinions within judgments include:

* Majority opinion: the opinion of more than half of the judges deciding a case. This opinion becomes precedent for future cases as it represents the views of the majority of the court.
* Concurring opinion: the opinion of a single judge or judges that agrees with the final outcome of the majority opinion but disagrees in whole or in part with the reasoning.
* Plurality opinion: the opinions of different judges of the court when a majority judgment is not obtained. An example of a plurality opinion is a court of three judges each rendering a different concurring decision, agreeing on a final outcome but disagreeing on the reasons justifying that final outcome.
* Dissenting opinion: the opinion of a single judge or judges that rejects the conclusions of the majority decision in whole or in part, and explains the reasons for rejecting the majority decision.

== Enforcement of judgments ==

When a court renders a judgment, it may state that the successful party has a right to recover money or property. However, the court will not collect the money or property on behalf of the successful party without further action. In common law legal systems, judgment enforcement is regulated by administrative divisions such as a province, territory, or federated state, while in civil law legal systems judgment enforcement is regulated through the national &quot;Code of Civil Procedure&quot;. Judgment enforcement, on a conceptual level, is conducted in a similar way across different legal systems. Specific references to the judgment enforcement rules of Germany, Canada (Saskatchewan), and the United States (California) are made in this section.

The successful party may receive immediate payment from the unsuccessful party on the basis of the judgment and not require further action. A successful party who does not receive immediate payment must initiate a judgment enforcement process in order to collect the money or property that they are entitled to under the judgment. Once this process is initiated, the successful party may be referred to as the judgment creditor while the unsuccessful party will be referred to as the judgment debtor in North America.

Judgment creditors can register their judgments through the property registry system in their jurisdictions, levy the property in question through a writ of execution, or seek a court order for enforcement depending on the options available in their jurisdiction.

Judgment creditors may also need to investigate whether judgment debtors are capable of paying. Understanding whether a judgment debtor is capable of fulfilling the judgment order may affect the enforcement mechanism used to recover the money or property. Some steps are available in different jurisdictions to investigate or interview judgment creditors, and investigations may be conducted either by the judgment creditor or by a sheriff or bailiff.

Different enforcement mechanisms exist, including seizure and sale of the judgment debtor&#x27;s property or garnishment. Some jurisdictions, like California, also allow for additional enforcement mechanisms depending on the circumstances, such as suspending the judgment debtor&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license or professional license. In Germany, a bailiff is responsible for enforcing the judgment and is empowered to use a number of different enforcement mechanisms.

In Germany, the judgment creditor is entitled to enforce the judgment 30 years past the judgment date. In California and Saskatchewan, the judgment creditor is entitled to enforce the judgment 10 years past the judgment date subject to exceptions that allow the judgment creditor to renew the enforcement for an additional 10 years.
Release of judgments

Depending on the jurisdiction, the judgment debtor may be able to obtain a &quot;satisfaction and release of judgment&quot; document from the judgment creditor. This document affirms that the judgment debtor has fulfilled any obligations relating to the judgment.

For example, in California, a judgment creditor must file an &quot;Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment&quot; where it has been paid in full by the judgment debtor within 15 days of the judgment debtor&#x27;s request. This document has the effect of formally closing the case and terminating any ongoing garnishment arrangements or liens. In Saskatchewan, upon either the satisfaction or withdrawal of a judgment, a judgment debtor can seek a discharge of judgment. If successful, the judgment is removed from the Judgment Registry and detached from any property registered on the Personal Property registry, titles, or interests in land.

== Judgments by legal system ==
The requirements for judgments share many similarities and some differences between countries and legal systems. For instance, while the civil law imposes a statutory requirement to provide reasons for judgment, the common law recognizes a contextual duty to provide reasons depending on certain circumstances. The following section provides some information regarding judgments in different jurisdictions as well as examples of their treatment of other types of judgments, where available.

=== Common law ===

==== Australia ====

At the State level various State and Territory Courts allow for parties to obtain different types of judgments; including:

* &quot;Default judgment&quot; - if a defendant in a proceeding started by claim has not filed a notice of intention to defend and the time allowed under the State of Territory&#x27;s rules;
* &quot;Summary judgment&quot; - A party may, at any time after a defendant files a notice of intention to defend, apply to the court under this part for judgment against the other party, if the court is satisfied that—
** the party has no real prospect of succeeding on all or a part of the plaintiff’s claim; and
** there is no need for a trial of the claim or the part of the claim.

However, a Court may set aside a default judgment if the defendant can prove a number of key issues. In Queensland, in &quot;Unique Product Marketing Pty Ltd v Bortek Sales Pty Ltd&quot; [2000] QDC 314 Shanahan DCJ set-down some principles in relation to setting aside a regularly entered default judgment. They include:

# Whether there is a good reason why the defendant failed to file a defence;
# Whether there has been any delay by the defendant in bringing the application;
# The defendant’s conduct in the action before and after judgment;
# The defendant’s good faith;
# Whether the defendant has raised a prima facie defence on the merits; and
# Whether the plaintiff would be irreparably prejudiced if the judgment is set aside which cannot be adequately compensated by a suitable award of costs.

==== Canada (excluding Quebec) ====

The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized a common law duty to provide &quot;adequate&quot; reasons for judgment and has stated that &quot;the giving of reasoned judgments is central to the legitimacy of judicial institutions in the eyes of the public.&quot; Determining whether reasons for judgment are adequate is a contextual exercise that may call for different information or depth of reasoning based on the circumstances of the case. In general, Canadian courts are expected to provide reasons for judgment as a duty to the public at large, to demonstrate that the judge or judges have engaged with the parties&#x27; pleadings, to explain why the parties won or lost, and to allow for meaningful appellate review (in the event that the case may be appealed).

With the above guiding principles in mind, Canadian courts must &quot;read [the reasons] as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the arguments and the trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which they are delivered...&quot; to determine whether the reasons for judgment are adequate. The reasons must tell the reader why the judgment was made, but do not need to tell the reader how the judge made the decision rendered in the judgment.

Provincial rules of civil procedure provide further guidance relating to specific types of judgments. For example:

* &quot;Declaratory judgment&quot;: a declaratory judgment can be made by the court regardless of whether a remedy is being claimed.
* &quot;Default judgment&quot;: a default judgment can be sought by the plaintiff where a defendant “has been noted in default” for certain claims.
* &quot;Summary judgment&quot;: a summary judgment may be available if “there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence” or if “the parties agree to have all or part of the claim determined by a summary judgment and the court is satisfied that it is appropriate to grant summary judgment.”

==== Hong Kong ====

In &quot;Mak Kang Hoi v Ho Yuk Wah David&quot;, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal stated that &#x27;litigants are entitled to have their cases decided with reasonable promptitude&#x27;. The Court considered that the &#x27;extraordinary&#x27; and &#x27;inordinate&#x27; delay of 30 months which the trial judge (Madam Recorder Gladys Li SC) took in handing down her reserved judgment was &#x27;wholly excessive&#x27; and &#x27;extremely regrettable&#x27;, and recognised that &#x27;it may lead to a denial of justice as a Judge&#x27;s memory of the evidence, the witnesses, the submissions and the trial itself may fade with time&#x27;, but nonetheless upheld her decision as it was &#x27;objectively sound&#x27;.

Similarly, in &quot;Dr Yip Chi Him Roger v Lee Kwok Leung&quot;, the trial judge (Mr Justice Louis Chan) delivered his reserved judgment over 32 months after the trial. The Court of Appeal held that &#x27;notwithstanding the regrettable delay in giving judgment, we come to the firm and clear view that the Judge gave cogent and adequate reasons for his findings and there is no error of law or facts in his findings&#x27;, and dismissed the appeal.

Delays have occurred in a number of judicial review cases. For example, in &quot;Data Key Ltd v Director of Lands&quot;, &quot;Lui Yuet Tin v Commissioner for Transport&quot; and &quot;DI v Director of Immigration&quot;, Mr Justice Au handed down his reserved judgment 26 to 28 months after the hearing.

The Court of Appeal has on occasion delivered its reasons for judgment a significant period of time after the hearing. For example, in &quot;China Medical Technologies v Samson Tsang Tak Yung&quot;, the reasons for judgment, as well as the reserved decision as to costs, were delivered by Mr Justice Barma, JA after a delay of 34 months.

Similar delays have also been encountered in cases in the District Court. For example, in &quot;Leung Chi Wang v Leung Yui Shing&quot; (decided by Deputy District Judge Richard Leung), &quot;Kan Yay Shan v Mo You Mut&quot; (decided by Deputy District Judge Simon Lui), &quot;Golden Field Glass Works v Yeung Chun Keung&quot; (decided by Deputy District Judge Timon Shum), and &quot;Han Mei Fang v All Occupiers of Flat F, 6th Floor, Kapok Mansion&quot; (decided by Deputy District Judge Samson Hung), judgment was handed down between 31 and 33 months after the trial.

In &quot;Welltus v Fornton Knitting&quot;, after a trial which lasted 12 days, the trial judge (Deputy High Court Judge Ian Carlson) took over 10 months to hand down his reserved judgment. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge failed to give adequate reasons for his decision and stated that &#x27;the failure to deal with [one of the critical issues was] probably attributable to the delay in the preparation of the judgment&#x27;. The Court of Appeal therefore set aside the decision and ordered a re-trial before another judge of the Court of First Instance.

In &quot;HKSAR v Yip Kim Po&quot;, after a criminal trial lasting over one year, the trial judge (His Honour Judge Kevin Browne) gave Reasons for Verdict with 1,753 paragraphs spanning 465 pages. The Court of Appeal stated that the &#x27;sheer length of the judge&#x27;s Reasons for Verdict brings with it considerable difficulties for the appeal courts and any other newcomer to the case in trying to unravel the relevant evidence and identify the real issues at trial. An unduly lengthy set of Reasons also creates problems for the judge himself in focussing on the essential issues at trial so as to explain, clearly, concisely and expediently, why he came to the decision he did&#x27;. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal endorsed the remarks made by the Court of Appeal, and stated that &#x27;Whilst a judge should keep a record of the evidence and submissions, it is not the function of a judgment to be that record. Instead, the primary purpose of a judgment is: to identify the ultimate issues in the case; to set out, qualitatively by reference to the evidence that is accepted or rejected, the primary facts which the judge finds; to relate those findings to the factual issues in the case; to show how any inference has been drawn; to make the necessary findings of fact; to identify and apply the appropriate legal principles; and, ultimately, to make the appropriate dispositive orders&#x27;.

In &quot;HKSAR v Tin&#x27;s Label Factory Ltd&quot;, at the end of the hearing of the appeal in the Court of First Instance, Mr Justice Pang Kin-kee immediately delivered an oral decision allowing the appeal, with written reasons to be handed down at a later date. 7 months later, the Judge handed down the written reasons for judgment dismissing the appeal, a result which was inconsistent with the oral decision announced at the end of the hearing. After the appellant contacted the Judge&#x27;s clerk, later the same day the Judge retracted the &#x27;incorrect version&#x27; and delivered the &#x27;correct version&#x27; of the written reasons for judgment. The correction was made before the court order and record had been perfected. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal stated that &#x27;It must be reiterated and strongly emphasised that judges at all levels of court have a duty to deliver judgments within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the hearing. Where an oral decision has been given of the result, with reasons to follow later, it is incumbent upon the judge to deliver the reasons within a reasonable time. This is important not only for the parties, but it is essential to the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice. In the present case, the delay of seven-and-a-half months was unjustified&#x27;. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal further stated that &#x27;In handing down the 1st written judgment purporting to set out his reasons for &quot;dismissing&quot; the appeal on 15 May 2008, the Judge must have forgotten about his earlier oral decision allowing the appeal and omitted to check the file. The delay in preparing his reasons must have contributed to this oversight&#x27;.

==== New Zealand ==== 

In accordance with section 170 of the Senior Courts Act 2016, the Chief Justice of New Zealand, the President of the Court of Appeal and the Chief High Court Judge publish information about the indicative delivery times for reserved judgments in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Court respectively. As of 2017, the Supreme Court &#x27;will endeavour to deliver judgment in an appeal within six months from the last day of the hearing&#x27;. In the Court of Appeal and the High Court, most decisions are delivered within three months of the last day of the hearing.

==== United Kingdom ==== 

The Court of Appeal of England and Wales (Civil Division) has affirmed a common law duty to give reasons for a judgment, subject to some exceptions (such as an oral judgment or a summary judgment). The Court also noted that providing reasons for judgment &quot;is a function of due process, and therefore of justice.&quot; Interested parties must be able to determine why the court has made the decision in question. Furthermore, providing reasons for judgment serves a practical purpose insofar as it necessarily requires the court to engage in thoughtful consideration of the cases presented. However, the Court also noted that the exercise of providing reasons for judgment is contextual and the standard of what is acceptable for a judgment will vary depending on the circumstances. The court appears to propose that the ultimate requirement is the court explaining, in some way, why it has made the decision in question.

The UK Supreme Court has stated that where there has been a relatively long and expensive hearing/trial, it is important that the judgment (i) clearly identifies all the issues of fact and expert opinion that are in issue, and (ii) resolves in clear terms all such issues which are relevant on the judge&#x27;s view of the law, and those issues which would be relevant if the judge&#x27;s view of the law turns out to be wrong. Otherwise, there is a real risk of a complete or partial rehearing being ordered, which would bring the administration of law into disrepute.

Further, &quot;The Civil Procedure Rules 1998&quot; state that a judgment or order takes effect on the day it is rendered unless the court specifies otherwise and provide additional guidance on different types of judgments.

* &quot;Consent judgment&quot;: a consent judgment is available where the parties agree on the terms of the judgment or order that should be made.
* &quot;Declaratory judgment&quot;: a declaratory judgment can be made by the courts regardless of whether a remedy is being claimed.
* &quot;Default judgment&quot;: a default judgment is available where the defendant does not file acknowledgment of service or fails to file a defence. A default judgment may be set aside or varied if he defendant demonstrates “a real prospect of successfully defending the claim” or where exceptional circumstances apply.
* &quot;Summary judgment&quot;: a summary judgment is made without requiring a trial. A court may grant a summary judgment if either the claimant or the defendant has no prospect of succeeding and “there is no other compelling reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial.”

==== United States ==== 

At the federal level, a judgment is defined in the &quot;United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&quot; as &quot;a decree and any order from which an appeal lies&quot; and does not include &quot;recitals of pleadings, a master&#x27;s report, or a record of prior proceedings.&quot;

A judgment must address all of the issues raised with respect to the rights and liabilities of the parties. If a judgment is rendered without addressing all the rights and liabilities, the action is not ended and the claims of the parties may be revised before the entry of a judgment that determines all of the issues raised.

* &quot;Default judgment&quot;: If the defendant fails to plead or otherwise defend against the action, a default judgment may be entered. If the plaintiff&#x27;s claim is for a fixed amount of money, then the plaintiff can request that the clerk enter judgment for that amount along with costs against the defendant. Otherwise, the plaintiff will be required to appear before the court and present evidence for the damages or relief requested to receive a default judgment. If the defendant can demonstrate &quot;good cause&quot; for not responding to the default judgment, then the court may set aside the judgment at its discretion.
* &quot;Interlocutory injunction&quot;: A party can seek an interlocutory injunction relating to a proceeding. The court must provide reasons for either granting or denying an interlocutory injunction.
* &quot;Summary judgment&quot;: A party can seek a summary judgment on all or part of its claim. The court will grant a summary judgment if the party seeking the judgment demonstrates that there is no real dispute regarding the facts. The court must provide reasons for either granting or denying a summary judgment.

A state code of civil procedure provides its own rules relating to judgments in state courts. For instance, California&#x27;s &quot;Code of Civil Procedure&quot; provides some general rules regarding the purpose of and requirements for judgments as well as rules relating to summary judgments, default judgments, and interim or interlocutory judgments.

The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the federal Constitution generally requires states to recognize the records and judgments of other states.

==== France ==== 

A court&#x27;s duties regarding judgments are outlined in the &quot;Code de procédure civile&quot;. A judgment &quot;is given on behalf of the French people&quot; and must contain certain information, including the date, the names of the judges, the level of court, and the names of the parties involved. A judgment must also describe the parties&#x27; claims and the grounds on which their claims are based, identifying both the final judgment and the reasons for the judgment. In light of compliance with the rules of the &quot;Code&quot; and the absence of an appeal, a judgment is presumed to have been executed correctly.

Traditional French judgments often consisted of a single sentence wherein the court provided its judgment. However, a drive towards modernization of French judgments has encouraged judges to write much clearer judgments to encourage simplification and accessibility. Modern French judgments generally include &quot;[a] recounting [of] the facts, the procedure and the claims of the parties, as a narrative ... Such judgments may also be divided to deal with each element of the claim separately.&quot; Generally, French judgments are much shorter than their common law counterparts.
A court may either provide their judgment at the end of the hearing or defer the judgment to a specified date. If an oral judgment is rendered, it must be read by at least one of the judges who heard the case. Parties to the proceedings are entitled to receive &quot;a certified copy of the judgement imprinted with an order of enforcement.&quot; Once a judgment has been executed, it becomes res judicata. A judgment will be enforced once it becomes final subject to some exceptions. A judgment can only be enforced once a certified copy imprinted with an order of enforcement is provided and the affected parties have been notified.

* &quot;Default judgment:&quot; If one of the parties does not appear before the court, or one of the parties does not present their pleadings within the enumerated time limit, the appearing party is entitled to receive a default judgment on the merits of the case.
* &quot;Ex parte judgment&quot;: an ex parte judgment may be granted &quot;where the petitioner has good reason for not summoning the opposing party.&quot;
* &quot;Interlocutory Judgment:&quot; An interlocutory judgment, insofar as it gives rise to an investigation or an interim measure, stays the proceedings and does not equate to a final judgment.
* &quot;Summary judgment&quot;: a summary judgment may be granted at the request of one party in order to provide an order quickly as an alternative to a full trial.

==== Germany ==== 

A court&#x27;s duties regarding judgments are outlined in the Zivilprozessordnung. A trial judgment must contain certain information, including the parties and their representatives, the court and judges involved in the decision, the date the proceedings finished, the merits of the case and the reasons for the judgment. Specifically, the legislation requires that &quot;the claims asserted and the means of challenge or defence [be] brought before the court, highlighting the petitions filed. The details of the circumstances and facts as well as the status of the dispute thus far are to be included by reference being made to the written pleadings, the records of the hearings, and other documents ... [and] a brief summary of the considerations of the facts and circumstances of the case and the legal aspects on which the decision is based.&quot;

An appellate court judgment must include the findings of fact in the contested judgment, including any changes or amendments, and the reasons for the court&#x27;s determination of the appeal.

* &quot;Default judgment&quot;: a default judgment is rendered based on the defendant&#x27;s acknowledgment of their actions. A default judgment does not need to address the facts or merits of the case and does not require the provision of reasons.
* &quot;Interlocutory judgment&quot;: an interlocutory judgment is rendered when the court has enough information to make a decision. An interlocutory judgment is considered to be a final judgment and not subject to appeal unless the court deems further consideration necessary.
Judgments in most German courts are rendered &quot;in the name of the people&quot;.

==== Italy ==== 

The duty to provide reasons for a judgment is entrenched in Italy&#x27;s Constitution.

==== Japan ==== 

A court&#x27;s duties regarding judgments are outlined in &quot;民事訴訟法及び民事保全法の&quot; (&quot;Code of Civil Procedure&quot;). The &quot;Code&quot; states that a final judgment must be made &quot;when the suit is ripe for making a judicial decision.&quot; The judgment must contain the names of the parties, the court, the final date of oral argument, the facts, and the reasons for decision subject to some exceptions. A judgment must be rendered within two months of the conclusion of oral arguments unless exceptional circumstances apply and becomes effective once it has been rendered.

==== Saudi Arabia ==== 

A court&#x27;s duties regarding judgments are outlined in &quot;The Law of the Judiciary&quot;. Judgments must be pronounced in a public hearing and must &quot;include the grounds on which they were based and the legal authority thereof.&quot; A judgment may be rendered unanimously or by a majority vote. If the judgment contains a dissent, the majority decision in the judgment must address the dissenting opinion, and any dissenting judges must explain why they are dissenting.

Once a judgment has been issued, the judge or judges determine whether the parties involved agree with the ruling. If one party disagrees with the judgment, that party has a set number of days to request a written appeal. An appellate body will then review the judgment in the absence of the parties. If the appellate body agrees with the lower court&#x27;s decision, it will stamp &quot;final and enforceable&quot; on the judgment without providing any reasons and will return the judgment to the trial court. If the appellate body disagrees with the lower court&#x27;s decision, it may either send the case back to the trial court for reconsideration or, less commonly, may call the parties to present further arguments and write its own judgment based on the information presented.

<doc id="161978" wikidata="Q1821239" url="?curid=161978" title="Last Judgment">
<text>The Last Judgment is a concept found across the Abrahamic religions and the &quot;Frashokereti&quot; of Zoroastrianism.

Christianity considers the Second Coming of Jesus Christ to entail the final judgment by God of all people who have ever lived, resulting in the salvation of a few and the damnation of many. Some Christian denominations believe most people will be saved, some believe most people will be damned, and some believe the number of the saved and of the damned is unknown. The concept of the Last Judgment is found in all the canonical gospels, particularly in the Gospel of Matthew. The Christian tradition is also followed by Islam, where it is mentioned in many chapters of the Quran, according to some interpretations.

The Last Judgment has inspired numerous artistic depictions, including painting, sculpture and evangelical work.

==In Judaism==

In Judaism, beliefs vary. Rosh HaShanah is sometimes referred to as a &#x27;day of judgement&#x27;, but it is not conceptualized as &quot;the&quot; Day of Judgement. Some rabbis hold that there will be a future day following the resurrection of the dead. Others hold that the final accounting and judgment happens when one dies. Still others hold that the Last Judgment applies to only the gentiles, not the Jewish People.
The Babylonian Talmud has a lengthy passage describing the future Judgement Day.

==In Christianity==

===Biblical sources===
The doctrine and iconographic depiction of the Last Judgment are drawn from many passages from the apocalyptic sections of the Bible, but most notably from Jesus&#x27; teaching of the straight gate in the Gospel of Matthew and in the Gospel of Luke.

====Salvation and damnation====
In Christianity, there are three main beliefs about who will be saved (go to heaven) and who will be damned (go to hell) on Judgment Day. All three beliefs are based on biblical interpretation and Christian tradition.

Some Christians who believe in universal salvation say most people and angels will go to heaven on Judgment Day. Some Christians who believe in double predestination say most people and angels will go to hell on Judgment Day. Other Christians who disbelieve in universal salvation and double predestination say the number of the saved and of the damned on Judgment Day is unknown.

====Anglicanism and Methodism====
&quot;Article IV – Of the Resurrection of Christ&quot; in Anglicanism&#x27;s Articles of Religion and &quot;Article III – Of the Resurrection of Christ&quot; of Methodism&#x27;s Articles of Religion state that:
Anglican and Methodist theology holds that &quot;there is an intermediate state between death and the resurrection of the dead, in which the soul does not sleep in unconsciousness, but exists in happiness or misery till the resurrection, when it shall be reunited to the body and receive its final reward.&quot; This space, termed Hades, is divided into Paradise (the Bosom of Abraham) and Gehenna &quot;but with an impassable gulf between the two&quot;. Souls remain in Hades until the Last Judgment and &quot;Christians may also improve in holiness after death during the middle state before the final judgment&quot;.

Anglican and Methodist theology holds that at the time of the Last Day, &quot;Jesus will return and that He will &#x27;judge both the quick [the living] and the dead&#x27;,&quot; and &quot;all [will] be bodily resurrected and stand before Christ as our Judge. After the Judgment, the Righteous will go to their eternal reward in heaven, and the Accursed will depart to hell (see ).&quot; The &quot;issue of this judgment shall be a permanent separation of the evil and the good, the righteous and the wicked&quot; (see The Sheep and the Goats). Moreover, in &quot;the final judgment every one of our thoughts, words, and deeds will be known and judged,&quot; and individuals will be justified on the basis of their faith in Jesus. However, &quot;our works will not escape God&#x27;s examination.&quot;

====Catholicism====

Belief in the Last Judgment (often linked with the general judgment) is held firmly in Catholicism. Immediately upon death, each person undergoes the particular judgment, and depending upon one&#x27;s behavior on earth, goes to heaven, purgatory, or hell. Those in purgatory will always reach heaven, but those in hell will be there eternally.

The Last Judgment will occur after the resurrection of the dead, and &quot;our &#x27;mortal body&#x27; will come to life again.&quot; The Catholic Church teaches that at the time of the Last Judgment Christ will come in His glory, and all the angels with him, and in his presence the truth of each one&#x27;s deeds will be laid bare. Each person who has ever lived will be judged with perfect justice. The believers who are deemed worthy as well as those ignorant of Christ&#x27;s teaching who followed the dictates of conscience will go to everlasting bliss; those who are judged unworthy will go to everlasting condemnation.

A decisive factor in the Last Judgment will be the question, were the corporal works of mercy practiced or not during one&#x27;s lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 25:31–46), the conjunction of the Last Judgment and the works of mercy is frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.

Before the Last Judgment, all will be resurrected. Those who were in purgatory will have already been purged, meaning they would have already been released into heaven, and so like those in heaven and hell will resurrect with their bodies, followed by the Last Judgment.

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church:

The Eastern Orthodox and Catholic teachings of the Last Judgment differ only on the exact nature of the in-between state of purgatory/Abraham&#x27;s Bosom. These differences may only be apparent and not actual due to differing theological terminology and evolving tradition.

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that there are two judgments: the first, or particular judgment, is that experienced by each individual at the time of his or her death, at which time God will decide where one is to spend the time until the Second Coming of Christ (see Hades in Christianity). This judgment is generally believed to occur on the fortieth day after death. The second, General or Final Judgment will occur after the Second Coming.

Although in modern times some have attempted to introduce the concept of soul sleep into Orthodox thought about life after death, it has never been a part of traditional Orthodox teaching, and it contradicts the Orthodox understanding of the intercession of the Saints.

Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that salvation is bestowed by God as a free gift of divine grace, which cannot be earned, and by which forgiveness of sins is available to all. However, the deeds done by each person are believed to affect how he will be judged, following the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats. How forgiveness is to be balanced against behavior is not well-defined in scripture, judgment in the matter being solely Christ&#x27;s.

Similarly, although Orthodoxy teaches that sole salvation is obtained only through Christ and his Church, the fate of those outside the Church at the Last Judgment is left to the mercy of God and is not declared.

=====Icons=====

The theme of the Last Judgment is important in Orthodoxy. Traditionally, an Orthodox church will have a fresco or mosaic of the Last Judgment on the back (western) wall so that the faithful, as they leave the services, are reminded that they will be judged by what they do during earthly life.

The icon of the Last Judgment traditionally depicts Christ Pantokrator, enthroned in glory on a white throne, surrounded by the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), John the Baptist, the Apostles, saints and angels. Beneath the throne the scene is divided in half with the &quot;mansions of the righteous&quot; (), i.e., those who have been saved, to Jesus&#x27; right (the viewer&#x27;s left), and the torments of those who have been damned to his left. Separating the two is the river of fire which proceeds from Jesus&#x27; left foot. For more detail, see below.

=====Hymnography=====

The theme of the Last Judgement is found in the funeral and memorial hymnody of the Church, and is a major theme in the services during Great Lent. The second Sunday before the beginning of Great Lent is dedicated to the Last Judgement. It is also found in the hymns of the Octoechos used on Saturdays throughout the year.

====Cretan School====
There were many renditions of the Last Judgment completed by Greek painters living in Crete which was held by the Venetian Empire. Most of the works of art were influenced by Venetian painting but were considered to be painted in the Maniera Greca. Georgios Klontzas painted many triptychs featuring the Last Judgment some include &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, &quot;The Last Judgement Triptych&quot;, and &quot;The Triptych of the Last Judgement&quot;. Klontzas was the forerunner of a new painting style.

Other Greek painters followed the precedent set by Klontzas. Theodore Poulakis added the last judgment to his rendition of Klontzas&#x27; &quot;In Thee Rejoiceth&quot;. The painter incorporated the Last Judgement into one of Klontzas&#x27; earlier works entitled &quot;In Thee Rejoiceth&quot;. Poulakis paid homage to the father of the Last Judgement style. Leos Moskos and Francheskos Kavertzas also followed the outline for the stylistic representation of the Last Judgement set by Klontzas. Their works were &quot;The Last Judgment (Kavertzas)&quot; and &quot;The Last Judgment (Moskos)&quot;. Both paintings resemble Klontas&#x27; Last Judgement painting.

====Lutheranism====
Lutherans do not believe in any sort of earthly millennial kingdom of Christ either before or after his second coming on the last day. On the last day, all the dead will be resurrected. Their souls will then be reunited with the same bodies they had before dying. The bodies will then be changed, those of the wicked to a state of everlasting shame and torment, those of the righteous to an everlasting state of celestial glory. After the resurrection of all the dead, and the change of those still living, all nations shall be gathered before Christ, and he will separate the righteous from the wicked. Christ will publicly judge all people by the testimony of their faith – the good works of the righteous in evidence of their faith, and the evil works of the wicked in evidence of their unbelief. He will judge in righteousness in the presence of all and men and angels, and his final judgment will be just damnation to everlasting punishment for the wicked and a gracious gift of life everlasting to the righteous.

===Esoteric Christian traditions===
Although the Last Judgment is believed by a great part of Christian mainstream churches; some members of Esoteric Christian traditions like the Rosicrucians, the Spiritualist movement, and some liberals instead believe in a form of universal salvation.

Max Heindel, a Danish-American astrologer and mystic, taught that when the Day of Christ comes, marking the end of the current fifth or Aryan epoch, the human race will have to pass a final examination or last judgment, where, as in the &quot;Days of Noah&quot;, the chosen ones or pioneers, the &quot;sheep&quot;, will be separated from the &quot;goats&quot; or stragglers, by being carried forward into the next evolutionary period, inheriting the ethereal conditions of the New Galilee in the making. Nevertheless, it is emphasized that all beings of the human evolution will ultimately be saved in a distant future as they acquire a superior grade of consciousness and altruism. At the present period, the process of human evolution is conducted by means of successive rebirths in the physical world and the salvation is seen as being mentioned in Revelation 3:12 (KJV), which states &quot;Him that overcometh will I make a &quot;pillar&quot; in the temple of my God and &quot;he shall go no more out&quot;&quot;. However, this western esoteric tradition states – like those who have had a near-death experience – that after the death of the physical body, at the end of each physical lifetime and after the life review period (which occurs before the silver cord is broken), a judgment occurs, more akin to a Final Review or End Report over one&#x27;s life, where the life of the subject is fully evaluated and scrutinized. This judgment is seen as being mentioned in Hebrews 9:27, which states that &quot;it is appointed unto men once to die, but &quot;after this the judgment&quot;&quot;.

===Swedenborgian===
Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) had a revelation that the church has gone through a series of Last Judgments. First, during Noah&#x27;s Flood, then Moses on Mount Sinai, Jesus&#x27; crucifixion, and finally in 1757, which is the final Last Judgment. These occur in a realm outside earth and heaven, and are spiritual in nature.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) teaches that the last judgment for each individual occurs after that individual has been resurrected. People will be judged by Jesus Christ. Jesus&#x27; twelve apostles will help judge the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve Nephite disciples from the Book of Mormon will help to judge the Nephite and Lamanite people.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that people will be judged by their words, their works, their thoughts, and the intents of their hearts. Records that have been kept in heaven and on earth will also be used to judge people. Jesus Christ will act as the advocate for people who had faith in him and such people will enter God&#x27;s presence based on Jesus&#x27; merits as opposed to their own.

After the final judgment, an individual is assigned to one of the three degrees of glory.

===Artistic representations===

In art, the Last Judgment is a common theme in medieval and renaissance religious iconography. Like most early iconographic innovations, its origins stem from Byzantine art, although it was a less common subject than in the West during the Middle Ages. In Western Christianity, it is often the subject depicted in medieval cathedrals and churches, either outside on the central tympanum of the entrance or inside on the (rear) west wall, so that the congregation attending church saw the image on either entering or leaving.

In the 15th century it also appeared as the central section of a triptych on altarpieces, with the side panels showing heaven and hell, as in the Beaune Altarpiece or a triptych by Hans Memling. The usual composition has Christ seated high in the centre, flanked by angels, the Virgin Mary, and John the Evangelist who are supplicating on behalf of those being judged (in what is called a Deesis group in Orthodoxy). Saint Michael is often shown, either weighing the deceased on scales or directing matters, and there might be a large crowd of saints, angels, and the saved around the central group.
At the bottom of the composition a crowd of the deceased are shown, often with some rising from their graves. These are being sorted and directed by angels into the saved and the damned. Almost always the saved are on the viewer&#x27;s left (so on the right hand of Christ), and the damned on the right. The saved are led up to heaven, often shown as a fortified gateway, while the damned are handed over to devils who herd them down into hell on the right; the composition therefore has a circular pattern of movement. Often the damned disappear into a Hellmouth, the mouth of a huge monster, an image of Anglo-Saxon origin. The damned often include figures of high rank, wearing crowns, mitres, and often the Papal tiara during the lengthy periods when there were antipopes, or in Protestant depictions. There may be detailed depictions of the torments of the damned.

The most famous Renaissance depiction is Michelangelo Buonarroti&#x27;s &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; in the Sistine Chapel. Included in this fresco is his self-portrait, as St. Bartholomew&#x27;s flayed skin.

The image in Eastern Orthodox icons has a similar composition, but usually less space is devoted to hell, and there are often a larger number of scenes; the Orthodox readiness to label figures with inscriptions often allows more complex compositions. There is more often a large group of saints around Christ (which may include animals), and the hetoimasia or &quot;empty throne&quot;, containing a cross, is usually shown below Christ, often guarded by archangels; figures representing Adam and Eve may kneel below it or below Christ. A distinctive feature of the Orthodox composition, especially in Russian icons, is a large band leading like a chute from the feet of Christ down to hell; this may resemble a striped snake or be a &quot;river of Fire&quot; coloured flame red. If it is shown as a snake, it attempts to bite Adam on the heel but, as he is protected by Christ, is unsuccessful.

==In Islam==
Belief in Judgment Day ( or ) is considered a fundamental tenet of faith by all Muslims. It is one of the six articles of faith. The trials and tribulations associated with it are detailed in both the Quran and the hadith, (sayings of Muhammad), from whence they are elaborated on in the creeds, Quranic commentaries (tafsịrs), and theological writing, eschatological manuals, whose authors include al-Ghazali, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Majah, Muhammad al-Bukhari, and Ibn Khuzaymah.

According to some Islamic teachings, there are two categories of heaven: those who go directly to it and those who enter it after enduring some torment in hell; Also, the people of hell are of two categories: those who stay there temporarily and those who stay there forever.

;Similarities to the Judgement Day of Christianity 
Like Christianity, Islamic eschatology has a time of tribulation preceding Judgement Day where strange and terrible events will serve as portents; there will be a second coming of Jesus (but in different roles); battles with an AntiChrist (Al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl, literally &quot;Deceitful Messiah&quot;) and struggles with Gog and Magog; and a Rapture-like removal of all righteous believers before the end. A &quot;Day of Resurrection&quot; of the dead (&quot;yawm al-qiyāmah&quot;), will be announced by a trumpet blast. Resurrection will be followed by a &quot;Day of Judgment&quot; (&quot;yawm ad-din&quot;) where all human beings who have ever lived will be held accountable for their deeds by being judged by God. Depending on the verdict of the judgement, they will be sent for eternity to either the reward of paradise (&quot;Jannah&quot;) or the punishment of hell (&quot;Jahannam&quot;). 
;Salvation and damnation
In this process, the souls will traverse over hellfire via the bridge of sirat. For sinners, the bridge will be thinner than hair and sharper than the sharpest sword, impossible to walk on without falling below to arrive at their fiery destination, while the righteous will proceed across the bridge to paradise (&quot;Jannah&quot;).

Not everyone consigned to hell will remain there. Somewhat like the Catholic concept of purgatory, sinful Muslims will stay in hell until purified of their sins. According to the scholar Al-Subki (and others), &quot;God will take out of the Fire everyone who has said the testimony&quot; (i.e. the &quot;shāhada&quot; testimony made by all Muslims, &quot;There is no deity but The God&quot;) &quot;and none will remain to save those who rejected or worshipped other than God.&quot;

;Literal or figurative interpretation
While early Muslims debated whether scripture on Judgement day should be interpreted literally or figuratively, the school of thought that prevailed (Ashʿarī) &quot;affirmed that such things as the individual records of deeds (including the paper, pen, and ink with which they are inscribed), the bridge, the balance, and the pond are realities to be understood in a concrete and literal sense.&quot;

==In Jainism==
In Jainism, there is no day of judgement as such. Jains believe, however, that as the 5th era comes to an end, evil will increase and the religion and good will decrease. Only four Jains will remain in the world: a monk, a female monk, a shravak and a shravika. A deity from the heavens will descend upon the earth and gather them, and ask them to take &quot;Anshan&quot;, or vow to fast (without any food or water) until death.

==In Zoroastrianism==

&quot;Frashokereti&quot; is the Zoroastrian doctrine of a final renovation of the universe, when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will be then in perfect unity with God (Ahura Mazda).

The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the &quot;salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person&#x27;s] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this.&quot; Thus, each human bears responsibility for their own fate, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.

==In Yarsanism==
In Yarsanism is a belief that people reincarnate until the Day of Resurrection when the last reincarnation occurs and pious people will be separated from sinful. God will forgive sins of pious souls and they will be rewarded with two paradises to which they will be sent according to what they look for. If they look for worldly pleasures, they will be sent to a mortal paradise, where they will perish one day. If they look for the mystical joy, then they will be sent to the immortal paradise, where they will live in the presence of God. Sinners will go to hell. 

==Crack of doom==
In English, &quot;crack of doom&quot; is an old term used for the Day of Judgment, referring in particular to the blast of trumpets signalling the end of the world in Chapter 8 of the Book of Revelation. A &quot;crack&quot; had the sense of any loud noise, preserved in the phrase &quot;crack of thunder&quot;, and &quot;doom&quot; was a term for the Last Judgment, as Eschatology still is.

The phrase is famously used by William Shakespeare in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, where on the heath the Three Witches show Macbeth the line of kings that will issue from Banquo: 
:&quot;Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
:What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom? 
:Another yet! A seventh! I&#x27;ll see no more.&quot; (Act 4, scene 1, 112–117)

The meaning was that Banquo&#x27;s line will endure until the Judgment Day, flattery for King James I, who claimed descent from Banquo.

<doc id="161979" wikidata="Q12621536" url="?curid=161979" title="Judgement">
<text>Judgement (or judgment) is the evaluation of given circumstances to make a decision. Judgement is also the ability to make considered decisions. The term has at least five distinct uses.

In an informal context, a judgement is opinion expressed as fact. Formally, a judgement is the act of evaluating the validity or correctness of a statement. In the context of a legal trial, a judgement is a final finding, statement or ruling, based on evidence, rules and precedents, called &quot;adjudication&quot; (see Judgment (law)). In the context of psychology, &quot;judgment&quot; informally references the quality of a person&#x27;s cognitive faculties and adjudicational capabilities, typically called &quot;wisdom&quot;. In formal psychology, judgement and decision making (JDM) is a cognitive process by which individuals reason, make decisions, and form opinions and beliefs.

Additionally, &quot;judgement&quot; can mean personality judgment; a psychological phenomenon in which a person forms specific opinions of other people.

==Psychology==

In cognitive psychology (and related fields like experimental philosophy, social psychology, behavioral economics, or experimental economics), judgement is part of a set of cognitive processes by which individuals reason, make decisions, and form beliefs and opinions (collectively, judgement and decision making, abbreviated JDM). This involves evaluating information, weighing evidence, making choices, and coming to conclusions. Judgements are often influenced by cognitive biases, heuristics, prior experience, social context, abilities (e.g., numeracy, probabalistic thinking), and psychological traits (e.g., tendency toward analytical reasoning). In research, the Society for Judgment and Decision Making is an international academic society dedicated to the topic; they publish the peer-reviewed journal Judgment and Decision Making.

==Formal judgement==

One may use the power or faculty of judgement to render judgements, in seeking to understand ideas and the things they represent, by means of ratiocination, using good or poor discernment or judgement. Each use of the word judgement has a different sense, corresponding to the triad of mental power, act, and habit.

Whether habits can be classified or studied scientifically, and whether there is such a thing as human nature, are ongoing controversies.

===Judging power or faculty===

Aristotle observed that our power to judge takes two forms: making assertions and thinking about definitions. He defined these powers in distinctive terms. Making an assertion as a result of judging can affirm or deny something; it must be either true or false. In a judgement, one affirms a given relationship between two things, or one denies a relationship between two things exists. The kinds of definitions that are judgements are those that are the intersection of two or more ideas rather than those indicated only by usual examples — that is, constitutive definitions.

Later Aristotelians, like Mortimer Adler, questioned whether &quot;definitions of abstraction&quot; that come from merging examples in one&#x27;s mind are really analytically distinct from judgements. The mind may automatically tend to form a judgement upon having been given such examples.

===Distinction of parts===
In informal use, words like &quot;judgement&quot; are often used imprecisely, even when keeping them separated by the triad of power, act, and habit.

Aristotle observed that while we interpret propositions drawn from judgements and call them &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;, the objects that the &quot;terms&quot; try to represent are only &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;—with respect to the judging act or communicating that judgement—in the sense of &quot;well-chosen&quot; or &quot;ill-chosen&quot;.

For example, we might say the proposition &quot;the orange is round&quot; is a true statement because we agree with the underlying judged relation between the objects of the terms, making us believe the statement to be faithful to reality. However the object of the term &quot;orange&quot; is no relation to be judged true or false, and the name taken separately &quot;as a term&quot; merely represents something brought to our attention, correctly or otherwise, for the sake of the judgement with no further evaluation possible.

Or one might see &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot; and call this statement derived from an arithmetical judgement true, but one would most likely agree that the objects of the number &quot;terms&quot; &quot;2&quot; and &quot;4&quot; are by themselves neither true nor false.

As a further example, consider the language of the math problem; &quot;express composite number &quot;n&quot; in terms of prime factors&quot;. Once a composite number is separated into prime numbers as the objects of the assigned terms of the problem, one can see they are, in a sense, &quot;called&quot; terms because their objects are the final components that arise at the point of certain judgements, like in the case of &quot;judgement of separation&quot;. These are types of judgements described in this example, which must &quot;terminate&quot;, because reaching the place where no further &quot;judgements of reduction&quot; of a certain quality (in this case, non-unity integers dividing integers into non-unity integer quotients) can occur.

==Judgement in religion==
* Christianity – Jesus warned about judging others in the Sermon on the Mount: &quot;Do not judge, so that you may not be judged.&quot; ().
* The Last Judgement is a significant concept in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), and also found in the Frashokereti of Zoroastrianism.

<text>Marciana Marina is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Livorno (administrative region of Tuscany, Italy), one of the most important towns of Elba Island. 
It is situated at sea level, with nearly 2,000 inhabitants.

There is a small marina (Circolo della Vela Marciana Marina), two small beaches and an old Torre Medicea, built to protect the city in the past from the frequent pirate invasion.

The promenade going from the old part of the city (called Il Cotone) to the Torre Medicea has preserved the original architectonical and urbanistic features of the 18th century.

<doc id="161994" wikidata="Q7423311" url="?curid=161994" title="Isolating language">
<text>An isolating language is a type of language with a morpheme per word ratio close to one, and with no inflectional morphology whatsoever. In the extreme case, each word contains a single morpheme. Examples of widely spoken isolating languages are Yoruba in West Africa and Vietnamese (especially its colloquial register) in Southeast Asia.

A closely related concept is that of an analytic language, which uses unbound morphemes or syntactical constructions to indicate grammatical relationships. Isolating and analytic languages tend to overlap in linguistic scholarship.

Isolating languages contrast with synthetic languages, also called inflectional languages, where words often consist of multiple morphemes. That linguistic classification is subdivided into the classifications fusional, agglutinative, and polysynthetic, which are based on how the morphemes are combined.

==Explanation==
Although historically, languages were divided into three basic types (&quot;isolating&quot;, &quot;inflectional&quot;, &quot;agglutinative&quot;), the traditional morphological types can be categorized by two distinct parameters:

* morpheme per word ratio (how many morphemes there are per word)
* degree of fusion between morphemes (how separable the inflectional morphemes of words are according to units of meaning represented)

A language is said to be more isolating than another if it has a lower morpheme per word ratio.

To illustrate the relationship between words and morphemes, the English term &quot;rice&quot; is a single word, consisting of only one morpheme (&quot;rice&quot;). This word has a 1:1 morpheme per word ratio. In contrast, &quot;handshakes&quot; is a single word consisting of three morphemes (&quot;hand&quot;, &quot;shake&quot;, &quot;-s&quot;). This word has a 3:1 morpheme per word ratio. On average, words in English have a morpheme per word ratio substantially greater than one.

It is perfectly possible for a language to have one inflectional morpheme yet more than one unit of meaning. For example, the Russian word &quot;vídyat&quot;/видят &quot;they see&quot; has a morpheme per word ratio of 2:1 since it has two morphemes. The root &quot;vid-&quot;/вид- conveys the imperfective aspect meaning, and the inflectional morpheme &quot;-yat&quot;/-ят inflects for four units of meaning (third-person subject, plural subject, present/future tense, indicative mood). Effectively, it has four units of meaning in one inseparable morpheme: &quot;-yat&quot;/-ят.

Languages with a higher tendency toward isolation generally exhibit a morpheme-per-word ratio close to 1:1. In an ideal isolating language, visible morphology would be entirely absent, as words would lack any internal structure in terms of smaller, meaningful units called morphemes. Such a language would not use bound morphemes like affixes.

The morpheme-to-word ratio operates on a spectrum, ranging from lower ratios that skew toward the isolating end to higher ratios on the synthetic end of the scale. A larger overall ratio suggests that a language leans more toward being synthetic rather than isolating.

<text>In biology, quorum sensing or quorum signaling (QS) is the process of cell-to-cell communication that allows bacteria to detect and respond to cell population density by gene regulation, typically as a means of acclimating to environmental disadvantages.

More specifically, quorum sensing is a type of cellular signaling, and more specifically can be considered a type of paracrine signaling. However, it also contains traits of autocrine signaling: a cell produces both an autoinducer molecule and the receptor for the autoinducer. As one example, QS enables bacteria to restrict the expression of specific genes to the high cell densities at which the resulting phenotypes will be most beneficial, especially for phenotypes that would be ineffective at low cell densities and therefore too energetically costly to express. Many species of bacteria use quorum sensing to coordinate gene expression according to the density of their local population. In a similar fashion, some social insects use quorum sensing to determine where to nest. Quorum sensing in pathogenic bacteria activates host immune signaling and prolongs host survival, by limiting the bacterial intake of nutrients, such as tryptophan, which further is converted to serotonin. As such, quorum sensing allows a commensal interaction between host and pathogenic bacteria. Quorum sensing may also be useful for cancer cell communications.

In addition to its function in biological systems, quorum sensing has several useful applications for computing and robotics. In general, quorum sensing can function as a decision-making process in any decentralized system in which the components have: (a) a means of assessing the number of other components they interact with and (b) a standard response once a threshold of the number of components is detected.
==Discovery==
The first observations of an autoinducer-controlled phenotype in bacteria were reported in 1970, by Kenneth Nealson, Terry Platt, and J. Woodland Hastings, who observed what they described as a conditioning of the medium in which they had grown the bioluminescent marine bacterium &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot;. These bacteria did not synthesize luciferase—and therefore did not luminesce—in freshly inoculated culture but only after the bacterial population had increased significantly.

In a series of publications from 1998 to 2001, Bonnie Bassler showed that quorum sensing is not just an isolated mechanism in &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot;, but is used ubiquitously across bacteria to communicate. This important advance demonstrated that bacteria are capable of carrying out complex, collective behaviors.

==Etymology==
Because Nealson, Platt, and Hastings attributed the conditioning of the growth medium to the growing population of cells itself, they referred to the phenomenon as autoinduction.

In 1994, after study of the phenomenon had expanded into several additional bacteria, Stephen Winans did not believe the word &quot;autoinduction&quot; fully characterized the true process so, in a review article coauthored with W. Claiborne Fuqua and E. Peter Greenberg, he introduced the term &quot;quorum sensing&quot;. Its use also avoided confusion between the terms &quot;autoinduction&quot; and &quot;autoregulation&quot;. The new term was not stumbled onto, but rather created through trial and error. Among the alternatives that Winans had created and considered were &quot;gridlockins&quot;, &quot;communiolins&quot;, and &quot;quoromones&quot;.

==Bacteria==


Some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria. Bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions, which in turn, coordinate their behaviors. Some common phenotypes include biofilm formation, virulence factor expression, and motility. Certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence, nitrogen fixation and sporulation.

The quorum-sensing function is based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment. It can occur within a single bacterial species, as well as between diverse species. Both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing, but there are some major differences in their mechanisms.

===Mechanism===
For the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively, they must possess three abilities: secretion of a signaling molecule, secretion of an autoinducer (to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules), and regulation of gene transcription as a response. This process is highly dependent on the diffusion mechanism of the signaling molecules. QS signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria. At low cell density, the molecules may just diffuse away. At high cell density, the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level, and trigger changes in gene expression.

====Gram-positive bacteria====
Gram-positive bacteria use autoinducing peptides (AIP) as their autoinducers.

When gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of AIPs in their environment, that happens by way of AIPs binding to a receptor to activate a kinase. The kinase phosphorylates a transcription factor, which regulates gene transcription. This is called a two-component system.

Another possible mechanism is that AIP is transported into the cytosol, and binds directly to a transcription factor to initiate or inhibit transcription.

====Gram-negative bacteria====
Gram-negative bacteria produce N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) as their signaling molecule. Usually AHLs do not need additional processing, and bind directly to transcription factors to regulate gene expression.

Some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well.

===Examples===

====&quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot;====
The bioluminescent bacterium &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot; is the first organism in which QS was observed. It lives as a mutualistic symbiont in the photophore (or light-producing organ) of the Hawaiian bobtail squid. When &quot;A. fischeri&quot; cells are free-living (or planktonic), the autoinducer is at low concentration, and, thus, cells do not show luminescence. However, when the population reaches the threshold in the photophore (about cells/ml), transcription of luciferase is induced, leading to bioluminescence.
In &quot;A. fischeri&quot;, bioluminescence is regulated by AHLs (N-acyl-homoserine lactones) which is a product of the LuxI gene whose transcription is regulated by the LuxR activator. LuxR works only when AHLs binds to the LuxR.

====&quot;Curvibacter&quot; sp.====
&quot;Curvibacter&quot; sp. is a gram-negative curved rod-formed bacterium which is the main colonizer of the epithelial cell surfaces of the early branching metazoan &quot;Hydra vulgaris&quot;. Sequencing the complete genome uncovered a circular chromosome (4.37 Mb), a plasmid (16.5 kb), and two operons coding each for an AHL (N-acyl-homoserine lactone) synthase (&quot;curI1&quot; and &quot;curI2&quot;) and an AHL receptor (&quot;curR1&quot; and &quot;curR2&quot;). Moreover, a study showed that these host associated &quot;Curvibacter&quot; bacteria produce a broad spectrum of AHL, explaining the presence of those operons. As mentioned before, AHL are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria, which means &quot;Curvibacter&quot; has a quorum sensing activity.

Even though their function in host-microbe interaction is largely unknown, &quot;Curvibacter&quot; quorum-sensing signals are relevant for host-microbe interactions. Indeed, due to the oxidoreductase activity of &quot;Hydra&quot;, there is a modification of AHL signalling molecules (3-oxo-homoserine lactone into 3-hydroxy-homoserine lactone) which leads to a different host-microbe interaction. On one hand, a phenotypic switch of the colonizer &quot;Curvibacter&quot; takes place. The most likely explanation is that the binding of 3-oxo-HSL and 3-hydroxy-HSL causes different conformational changes in the AHL receptors &quot;curR1&quot; and &quot;curR2&quot;. As a result, there is a different DNA-binding motif affinity and thereby different target genes are activated. On the other hand, this switch modifies its ability to colonize the epithelial cell surfaces of &quot;Hydra vulgaris&quot;. Indeed, one explanation is that with a 3-oxo-HSL quorum-sensing signal, there is an up-regulation of flagellar assembly. Yet, flagellin, the main protein component of flagella, can act as an immunomodulator and activate the innate immune response in &quot;Hydra&quot;. Therefore, bacteria have less chance to evade the immune system and to colonize host tissues. Another explanation is that 3-hydroxy-HSL induces carbon metabolism and fatty acid degradation genes in &quot;Hydra&quot;. This allows the bacterial metabolism to adjust itself to the host growth conditions, which is essential for the colonization of the ectodermal mucus layer of &quot;Hydrae&quot;.

==== &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot; ====
&quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot; is an opportunistic, gram-positive bacteria that forms biofilm in glass. This process is also known as forming a biofilm in vitro. The presence of (Esp), a certain cell surface protein, aids the formation of a biofilm by &quot;E. faecalis&quot;.

The ability of &quot;E. faecalis&quot; to form biofilms contributes to its capacity to survive in extreme environments, and facilitates its involvement in persistent bacterial infection, particularly in the case of multi-drug resistant strains. Biofilm formation in &quot;E. faecalis&quot; is associated with DNA release, and such release has emerged as a fundamental aspect of biofilm formation. Conjugative plasmid DNA transfer in &quot;E. faecalis&quot; is enhanced by the release of peptide sex pheromones.

==== &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; ====
In the gram-negative bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, cell division may be partially regulated by AI-2-mediated quorum sensing. This species uses AI-2, which is produced and processed by the &quot;lsr&quot; operon. Part of it encodes an ABC transporter, which imports AI-2 into the cells during the early stationary (latent) phase of growth. AI-2 is then phosphorylated by the LsrK kinase, and the newly produced phospho-AI-2 can be either internalized or used to suppress LsrR, a repressor of the &quot;lsr&quot; operon (thereby activating the operon). Transcription of the &quot;lsr&quot; operon is also thought to be inhibited by dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) through its competitive binding to LsrR. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the &quot;lsr&quot; operon through cAMP-CAPK-mediated inhibition. This explains why, when grown with glucose, &quot;E. coli&quot; will lose the ability to internalize AI-2 (because of catabolite repression). When grown normally, AI-2 presence is transient.

&quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; do not produce AHL signals commonly found in other gram-negative bacteria. However, they have a receptor that detects AHLs from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other &quot;quorate&quot; populations of gram-negative bacteria. AHL quorum sensing regulates a wide range of genes through cell density. Other species of bacteria produce AHLs that &quot;Escherichia&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot; can detect. &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot; produce a receptor like protein (SdiA) allowing the amino acid sequence that is similar to AHL show AHLs can be found in the bovine rumen and &quot;E. coli&quot; responds to AHLs taken out of the bovine rumen. Most animals do not have AHL in their gastrointestinal tracts.

====&quot;Salmonella enterica&quot;====
&quot;Salmonella&quot; encodes a LuxR homolog, SdiA, but does not encode an AHL synthase. SdiA detects AHLs produced by other species of bacteria including &quot;Aeromonas hydrophila&quot;, &quot;Hafnia alvei&quot;, and &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot;. When AHL is detected, SdiA regulates the &quot;rck&quot; operon on the &quot;Salmonella&quot; virulence plasmid (&quot;pefI-srgD-srgA-srgB-rck-srgC&quot;) and a single gene horizontal acquisition in the chromosome &quot;srgE&quot;. &quot;Salmonella&quot; does not detect AHL when passing through the gastrointestinal tracts of several animal species, suggesting that the normal microbiota does not produce AHLs. However, SdiA does become activated when &quot;Salmonella&quot; transits through turtles colonized with &quot;Aeromonas hydrophila&quot; or mice infected with &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot;. Therefore, &quot;Salmonella&quot; appears to use SdiA to detect the AHL production of other pathogens rather than the normal gut flora.

====&quot;Myxococcus xanthus&quot;====
&quot;Myxococcus&quot; is a genus of gram-negative bacterium in the Myxococcacae family. &quot;Myxococcus xanthus&quot; specifically, a bacillus myxobacteria species within Myxococcae, grows in the upper layers of soil. This bacterium is known for its unique utilization of quorum sensing practices to hunt.

The bacterium uniquely survives not on sugars, but lipids created by the degradation of macromolecules lysed by the species. It hunts and feeds through a density-regulated method of predation that is &quot;the regulation of gene expression in response to cell density.&quot; The pilus propelled microorganism moves with the use of both S- and A- (or gliding) motility, which provide transportation across a dynamic range of different surfaces. &quot;M. xanthus&quot; A-motility is most effective in the presence of a single or low number of cells, allowing the bacteria to glide in high agar concentrations. The S-motility, or social motility, is controlled by the process of quorum sensing and is only effective when cells are within one cell length of a neighbor. Although the precise specifics of &quot;M. xanthus&quot; communication methods for quorum sensing are not well understood, the bacteria mediate the process by using both C-signal and A-factor. The A-factor molecule, produced by &quot;M. xanthus&quot;, must reach a set concentration to initiate aggregation for hunting. The C-signal concentration, on the other hand, plays a role in fruiting body production.

The species is known for its ability to use quorum sensing to hunt in special packs with thousands of individual cells, lending to &quot;M. xanthus&quot; name &quot;the wolf packs.&quot; &quot;M. xanthus&quot; is inclined to behave in a multicellular fashion. In the presence of many cells, it uses these &quot;wolf packs&quot; to form &quot;highly structured biofilms that include tentacle-like packs of surface-gliding cell groups, synchronized rippling waves of oscillating cells and massive spore-filled aggregates that protrude upwards from the substratum to form fruiting bodies.&quot; On the fringes of this film, individual cells can be observed &quot;gliding across the surface, but the majority of cells are observed in large tendril-shaped groups&quot; using S-motility.

==== &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; ====
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is a type of pathogen that causes infection to the skin and soft tissue and can lead to a variety of more severe diseases such as osteomyelitis, pneumonia, and endocarditis. &quot;S. aureus&quot; uses biofilms in order to increase its chances of survival by becoming resistant to antibiotics. Biofilms help &quot;S. aureus&quot; become up to 1500 times more resistant to antibiofilm agents, which try to break down biofilms formed by &quot;S. aureus&quot;.

====&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;====

Each year &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; kills more than a million people, even though vaccines are available. A complex quorum sensing system has evolved in &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; that regulates bacteriocin production. This system also enables entry into the competent state essential for natural genetic transformation. In naturally competent &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; the competent state is not a constitutive property. However competence can be induced by a peptide pheromone by means of a quorum-sensing mechanism. When the competent state is induced, this causes release of DNA from a sub-fraction of the &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; population, probably by cell lysis. Then most of the &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; cells that have been induced to competence become recipients and take up the DNA released by the donors. Thus it appears that natural transformation in &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; is a natural adaptive process for promoting genetic recombination, a process that resembles sexual reproduction in higher organisms.

====&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;====
The environmental bacterium and opportunistic pathogen &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; uses quorum sensing to coordinate the formation of biofilm, swarming motility, exopolysaccharide production, virulence, and cell aggregation. These bacteria can grow within a host without harming it until they reach a threshold concentration. Then they become aggressive, developing to the point at which their numbers are sufficient to overcome the host&#x27;s immune system, and form a biofilm, leading to disease within the host as the biofilm is a protective layer encasing the bacterial population. The relative ease of growth, handling, and genetic manipulation of &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; has lent much research effort to the quorum sensing circuits of this relatively common bacterium. Quorum sensing in &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; typically encompasses two complete AHL synthase-receptor circuits, LasI-LasR and RhlI-RhlR, as well as the orphan receptor-regulator QscR, which is also activated by the LasI-generated signal. Together, the multiple AHL quorum sensing circuits of &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; influence regulation of hundreds of genes.

Another form of gene regulation that allows the bacteria to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling. Recent studies have discovered that anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing. This important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on the production of virulence factors of this organism. There is hope among some humans that the therapeutic enzymatic degradation of the signaling molecules will be possible when treating illness caused by biofilms, and prevent the formation of such biofilms and possibly weaken established biofilms. Disrupting the signaling process in this way is called &quot;quorum sensing inhibition&quot;.

====&quot;Acinetobacter&quot; sp.====
It has recently been found that &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; sp. also show quorum sensing activity. This bacterium, an emerging pathogen, produces AHLs. &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; sp. shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity. It produces AHLs and can also degrade the AHL molecules.

====&quot;Aeromonas&quot; sp.====
This bacterium was previously considered a fish pathogen, but it has recently emerged as a human pathogen. &quot;Aeromonas&quot; sp. have been isolated from various infected sites from patients (bile, blood, peritoneal fluid, pus, stool and urine). All isolates produced the two principal AHLs, N-butanoylhomoserine lactone (C4-HSL) and N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (C6-HSL). It has been documented that &quot;Aeromonas sobria&quot; has produced C6-HSL and two additional AHLs with N-acyl side chain longer than C6.

====&quot;Yersinia &quot;====
The YenR and YenI proteins produced by the gammaproteobacterium &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot; are similar to &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot; LuxR and LuxI. YenR activates the expression of a small non-coding RNA, YenS. YenS inhibits YenI expression and acylhomoserine lactone production. YenR/YenI/YenS are involved in the control of swimming and swarming motility.

====&quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;====

&quot;V. cholerae&quot; is a bacterial pathogen that causes cholera, a disease associated with severe contagious diarrhea that affects millions of people worldwide. &quot;V. cholerae&quot; is capable of strong communication between cells, and this process is referred to as quorum-sensing. In the small intestine, the absence of oxygen and exposure to host-produced bile salts, influence &quot;V. cholerae&quot; quorum sensing function and thus its pathogenicity. Quorum sensing appears to contribute to natural genetic transformation, a process that involves the uptake of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; extracellular DNA by (competent) &quot;V. cholerae&quot; cells.

===Molecules involved===
Three-dimensional structures of proteins involved in quorum sensing were first published in 2001, when the crystal structures of three LuxS orthologs were determined by X-ray crystallography. In 2002, the crystal structure of the receptor LuxP of &quot;Vibrio harveyi&quot; with its inducer AI-2 (which is one of the few biomolecules containing boron) bound to it was also determined. Many bacterial species, including &quot;E. coli&quot;, an enteric bacterium and model organism for gram-negative bacteria, produce AI-2. A comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of 138 genomes of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes found that &quot;the LuxS enzyme required for AI-2 synthesis is widespread in bacteria, while the periplasmic binding protein LuxP is present only in &quot;Vibrio&quot; strains,&quot; leading to the conclusion that either &quot;other organisms may use components different from the AI-2 signal transduction system of &quot;Vibrio&quot; strains to sense the signal of AI-2 or they do not have such a quorum sensing system at all.&quot; &quot;Vibrio&quot; species utilize Qrr RNAs, small non-coding RNAs, that are activated by these autoinducers to target cell density master regulators. Farnesol is used by the fungus &quot;Candida albicans&quot; as a quorum sensing molecule that inhibits filamentation.

A database of quorum-sensing peptides is available under the name Quorumpeps.

Certain bacteria can produce enzymes called lactonases that can target and inactivate AHLs.
Researchers have developed novel molecules which block the signalling receptors of bacteria (&quot;Quorum quenching&quot;). mBTL is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount.
Additionally, researchers are also examining the role of natural compounds (such as caffeine) as potential quorum sensing inhibitors. Research in this area has been promising and could lead to the development of natural compounds as effective therapeutics.

===Evolution===

====Sequence analysis====
The majority of quorum sensing systems that fall under the &quot;two-gene&quot; (an autoinducer synthase coupled with a receptor molecule) paradigm as defined by the &quot;Vibrio fischeri&quot; system occur in the gram-negative Pseudomonadota. A comparison between the Pseudomonadota phylogeny as generated by 16S ribosomal RNA sequences and phylogenies of LuxI-, LuxR-, or LuxS-homologs shows a notably high level of global similarity. Overall, the quorum sensing genes seem to have diverged along with the Pseudomonadota phylum as a whole. This indicates that these quorum sensing systems are quite ancient, and arose very early in the Pseudomonadota lineage.

LuxI and LuxR have coevolved through a long history of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. An early study reconciling their gene trees with the rRNA tree suggested frequent HGT events for both LuxI and LuxR, indicating that they are horizontally transferred together and coevolve due to their functional dependency. Similarly, in QS systems in bacteria associated with &quot;Populus deltoides&quot;, the gene trees for &quot;luxI&quot; and &quot;luxR&quot; show high topological similarity, indicating coevolution of cognate pairs. In addition to horizontal transfer of complete LuxI/LuxR-type QS systems, many Proteobacteria genomes exhibit an excess of LuxR genes or cases with only LuxR but not LuxI, acquired from different sources via HGT. Due to the frequent transfer of functional pairs of homologs (i.e., LuxI/LuxR-type systems from multiple independent sources), it is possible that the regulatory hierarchy formed by the LuxI/LuxR and RhlR-RhlI systems is a result of sequential integration of circuits obtained from different sources, due to interactions between multiple homologs. Interestingly, LuxI genes have likely undergone horizontal gene transfer from Proteobacteria to other lineages, as they have been detected in Nitrospira lineage II.

In quorum sensing genes of Gammaproteobacteria, which includes &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, the LuxI/LuxR genes form a functional pair, with LuxI as the auto-inducer synthase and LuxR as the receptor. Gammaproteobacteria are unique in possessing quorum sensing genes, which, although functionally similar to the LuxI/LuxR genes, have a markedly divergent sequence. This family of quorum-sensing homologs may have arisen in the Gammaproteobacteria ancestor, although the cause of their extreme sequence divergence yet maintenance of functional similarity has yet to be explained. In addition, species that employ multiple discrete quorum sensing systems are almost all members of the Gammaproteobacteria, and evidence of horizontal transfer of quorum sensing genes is most evident in this class.

====Interaction of quorum-sensing molecules with mammalian cells and its medical applications====
Next to the potential antimicrobial functionality, quorum-sensing derived molecules, especially the peptides, are being investigated for their use in other therapeutic domains as well, including immunology, central nervous system disorders and oncology. Quorum-sensing peptides have been demonstrated to interact with cancer cells, as well as to permeate the blood–brain barrier reaching the brain parenchyma.

=== Role of quorum sensing in biofilm development ===
Quorum sensing (QS) is used by bacteria to form biofilms. Quorum sensing is used by bacteria to form biofilms because the process determines if the minimum number of bacteria necessary for biofilm formation are present. The criteria to form a biofilm is dependent on a certain density of bacteria rather than a certain number of bacteria being present. When aggregated in high enough densities, some bacteria may form biofilms to protect themselves from biotic or abiotic threats. Quorum sensing is used by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria because it aids cellular reproduction. Once in a biofilm, bacteria can communicate with other bacteria of the same species. Bacteria can also communicate with other species of bacteria. This communication is enabled through autoinducers used by the bacteria.

Additionally, certain responses can be generated by the host organism in response to the certain bacterial autoinducers. Despite the fact that specific bacterial quorum sensing systems are different, for example the target genes, signal relay mechanisms, and chemical signals used between bacteria, the ability to coordinate gene expression for a specific species of bacteria remains the same. This ability alludes to the larger idea that bacteria have potential to become a multicellular bacterial body.

Secondly, biofilms may also serve to transport nutrients into the microbial community or transport toxins out by means of channels that permeate the extracellular polymeric matrix (like cellulose) that holds the cells together. Finally, biofilms are an ideal environment for horizontal gene transfer through either conjugation or environmental DNA (eDNA) that exists in the biofilm matrix.

The process of biofilm development is often triggered by environmental signals, and bacteria are proven to require flagella to successfully approach a surface, adhere to it, and form the biofilm. As cells either replicate or aggregate in a location, the concentration of autoinducers outside of the cells increases until a critical mass threshold is reached. At this point, it is energetically unfavorable for intracellular autoinducers to leave the cell and they bind to receptors and trigger a signaling cascade to initiate gene expression and begin secreting an extracellular polysaccharide to encase themselves inside.

One modern method of preventing biofilm development without the use of antibiotics is with anti-QS substances, such (naringenin, taxifolin, etc.) that can be utilized as alternative form of therapy against bacterial virulence.

==Archaea==

===Examples===

====&quot;Methanosaeta harundinacea&quot; 6Ac====
&quot;Methanosaeta harundinacea&quot; 6Ac, a methanogenic archaeon, produces carboxylated acyl homoserine lactone compounds that facilitate the transition from growth as short cells to growth as filaments.

==Viruses==
A mechanism involving arbitrium has recently been described in bacteriophages infecting several &quot;Bacillus&quot; species. The viruses communicate with each other to ascertain their own density compared to potential hosts. They use this information to decide whether to enter a lytic or lysogenic life-cycle. This decision is crucial as it affects their replication strategy and potential to spread within the host population, optimizing their survival and proliferation under varying environmental conditions. This communication mechanism enables a coordinated infection strategy, significantly enhancing the efficiency of phage proliferation. By synchronizing their life cycles, bacteriophages can maximize their impact on the host population, potentially leading to more effective control of bacterial densities.

==Plants==
QS is important to plant-pathogen interactions, and their study has also contributed to the QS field more generally. The first X-ray crystallography results for some of the key proteins were those of &quot;Pantoea stewartii&quot; subsp. &quot;stewartii&quot; in maize/corn and &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;, a crop pathogen with a wider range of hosts. These interactions are facilitated by quorum-sensing molecules and play a major role in maintaining the pathogenicity of bacteria towards other hosts, such as humans. This mechanism can be understood by looking at the effects of N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL), one of the quorum sensing-signaling molecules in gram-negative bacteria, on plants. The model organism used is &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;. Further insights reveal that AHLs influence plant immune responses and can alter plant hormone levels, thereby affecting plant growth and susceptibility to infection. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing innovative strategies to combat plant diseases and improve agricultural productivity. Researchers have also noted that certain plants can degrade these signaling molecules, potentially as a defensive strategy to disrupt bacterial communication. This interplay between bacterial signaling and plant responses suggests a complex co-evolutionary relationship that could be exploited to enhance crop resistance to bacterial pathogens.

The role of AHLs having long carbon-chains (C12, C14), which have an unknown receptor mechanism, is less well understood than AHLs having short carbon-chains (C4, C6, C8), which are perceived by the G protein-coupled receptor. A phenomenon called &quot;AHL priming&quot;, which is a dependent signalling pathway, enhanced our knowledge of long-chain AHLs. The role of quorum-sensing molecules was better explained according to three categories: host physiology–based impact of quorum sensing molecules; ecological effects; and cellular signaling. Calcium signalling and calmodulin have a large role in short-chain AHLs&#x27; response in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;. Research was also conducted on barley and the crop called yam bean (&quot;Pachyrhizus erosus&quot;) that reveals the AHLs determining the detoxification enzymes called GST were found less in yam bean.

Quorum sensing-based regulatory systems are necessary to plant-disease-causing bacteria. Looking towards developing new strategies based on plant-associated microbiomes, the aim of further study is to improve the quantity and quality of the food supply. Further research into this inter-kingdom communication also enhances the possibility of learning about quorum sensing in humans. This exploration could open new avenues for managing microbial communities in agricultural settings, potentially leading to the development of more sustainable farming practices that leverage natural microbial processes to boost crop resilience and productivity.

==Quorum quenching==

Quorum quenching is the process of preventing quorum sensing by disrupting signalling. This is achieved by inactivating signalling enzymes, by introducing molecules that mimic signalling molecules and block their receptors, by degrading signalling molecules themselves, or by a modification of the quorum sensing signals due to an enzyme activity.

===Inhibition===

Closantel and triclosan are known inhibitors of quorum sensing enzymes. Closantel induces aggregation of the histidine kinase sensor in two-component signalling. The latter disrupts the synthesis of a class of signalling molecules known as &quot;N&quot;-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) by blocking the enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase.

===Mimicry===

Two groups of well-known mimicking molecules include halogenated furanones, which mimic AHL molecules, and synthetic Al peptides (AIPs), which mimic naturally occurring AIPs. These groups inhibit receptors from binding substrate or decrease the concentration of receptors in the cell. Furanones have also been found to act on AHL-dependant transcriptional activity, whereby the half life of the autoinducer-binding LuxR protein is significantly shortened.

===Degradation===

Recently, a well-studied quorum quenching bacterial strain (KM1S) was isolated and its AHL degradation kinetics were studied using rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC). RRLC efficiently separates components of a mixture to a high degree of sensitivity, based on their affinities for different liquid phases. It was found that the genome of this strain encoded an inactivation enzyme with distinct motifs targeting the degradation of AHLs.

===Modifications===
As mentioned before, N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) are the quorum sensing signaling molecules of the gram-negative bacteria. However, these molecules may have different functional groups on their acyl chain, and also a different length of acyl chain. Therefore, there exist many different AHL signaling molecules, for example, 3-oxododecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) or 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3OHC12-HSL). The modification of those quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecules is another sort of quorum quenching. This can be carried out by an oxidoreductase activity. As an example, we will discuss the interaction between a host, &quot;Hydra vulgaris&quot;, and the main colonizer of its epithelial cell surfaces, &quot;Curvibacter&quot; spp. Those bacteria produce 3-oxo-HSL quorum sensing molecules. However, the oxidoreductase activity of the polyp &quot;Hydra&quot; is able to modify the 3-oxo-HSL into their 3-hydroxy-HSL counterparts. We can characterize this as quorum quenching since there is an interference with quorum sensing molecules. In this case, the outcomes differ from simple QS inactivation: the host modification results in a phenotypic switch of &quot;Curvibacter&quot;, which modifies its ability to colonize the epithelial cell surfaces of &quot;H. vulgaris&quot;.

===Applications===

Applications of quorum quenching that have been exploited by humans include the use of AHL-degrading bacteria in aquacultures to limit the spread of diseases in aquatic populations of fish, mollusks and crustaceans. This technique has also been translated to agriculture, to restrict the spread of pathogenic bacteria that use quorum sensing in plants. Anti-biofouling is another process that exploits quorum quenching bacteria to mediate the dissociation of unwanted biofilms aggregating on wet surfaces, such as medical devices, transportation infrastructure and water systems. Quorum quenching is recently studied for the control of fouling and emerging contaminants in electro membrane bioreactors (eMBRs) for the advanced treatment of wastewater. Extracts of several traditional medicinal herbs display quorum quenching activity, and have potential antibacterial applications.

==Social insects==
Social insect colonies are an excellent example of a decentralized system, because no individual is in charge of directing or making decisions for the colony. Several groups of social insects have been shown to use quorum sensing in a process that resembles collective decision-making.

===Examples===

====Ants====
Colonies of the ant &quot;Temnothorax albipennis&quot; nest in small crevices between rocks. When the rocks shift and the nest is broken up, these ants must quickly choose a new nest to move into. During the first phase of the decision-making process, a small portion of the workers leave the destroyed nest and search for new crevices. When one of these scout ants finds a potential nest, she assesses the quality of the crevice based on a variety of factors including the size of the interior, the number of openings (based on light level), and the presence or absence of dead ants. The worker then returns to the destroyed nest, where she waits for a short period before recruiting other workers to follow her to the nest that she has found, using a process called tandem running. The waiting period is inversely related to the quality of the site; for instance, a worker that has found a poor site will wait longer than a worker that encountered a good site. As the new recruits visit the potential nest site and make their own assessment of its quality, the number of ants visiting the crevice increases. During this stage, ants may be visiting many different potential nests. However, because of the differences in the waiting period, the number of ants in the best nest will tend to increase at the greatest rate. Eventually, the ants in this nest will sense that the rate at which they encounter other ants has exceeded a particular threshold, indicating that the quorum number has been reached. Once the ants sense a quorum, they return to the destroyed nest and begin rapidly carrying the brood, queen, and fellow workers to the new nest. Scouts that are still tandem-running to other potential sites are also recruited to the new nest, and the entire colony moves. Thus, although no single worker may have visited and compared all of the available options, quorum sensing enables the colony as a whole to quickly make good decisions about where to move.

====Honey bees====
Honey bees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) also use quorum sensing to make decisions about new nest sites. Large colonies reproduce through a process called swarming, in which the queen leaves the hive with a portion of the workers to form a new nest elsewhere. After leaving the nest, the workers form a swarm that hangs from a branch or overhanging structure. This swarm persists during the decision-making phase until a new nest site is chosen.

The quorum sensing process in honey bees is similar to the method used by &quot;Temnothorax&quot; ants in several ways. A small portion of the workers leave the swarm to search out new nest sites, and each worker assesses the quality of the cavity it finds. The worker then returns to the swarm and recruits other workers to her cavity using the honey bee waggle dance. However, instead of using a time delay, the number of dance repetitions the worker performs is dependent on the quality of the site. Workers that found poor nests stop dancing sooner, and can, therefore, be recruited to the better sites. Once the visitors to a new site sense that a quorum number (usually 10–20 bees) has been reached, they return to the swarm and begin using a new recruitment method called piping. This vibration signal causes the swarm to take off and fly to the new nest location. In an experimental test, this decision-making process enabled honey bee swarms to choose the best nest site in four out of five trials.

==Synthetic biology==
Quorum sensing has been engineered using synthetic biological circuits in different systems. Examples include rewiring the AHL components to toxic genes to control population size in bacteria; and constructing an auxin-based system to control population density in mammalian cells. Synthetic quorum sensing circuits have been proposed to enable applications like controlling biofilms or enabling drug delivery. Quorum sensing based genetic circuits have been used to convert AI-2 signals to AI-1 and then subsequently use the AI-1 signal to alter bacterial growth rate, thereby changing the composition of a consortium.

Remarkable advancements have been and are continuing to be made in recent years in our understanding of synthetic biology in terms of endocrine and paracrine signaling mechanisms, and the myriad of modes by which bacteria record domestic and foreign cell numbers. The modulation of gene expression in response to oscillations in cell-population density is thanks to the QS techniques regulating bacterial communication natural and artificial cultures. It is also clear that intra- and inter-species cell–cell communication occurs and is regulated by quorum sensing systems. Further, there is mounting data demonstrating that autoinducer signals elicit specific responses from eukaryotic hosts.

==Computing and robotics==
Quorum sensing can be a useful tool for improving the function of self-organizing networks such as the SECOAS (Self-Organizing Collegiate Sensor) environmental monitoring system. In this system, individual nodes sense that there is a population of other nodes with similar data to report. The population then nominates just one node to report the data, resulting in power savings. Ad hoc wireless networks can also benefit from quorum sensing, by allowing the system to detect and respond to network conditions.

Quorum sensing can also be used to coordinate the behavior of autonomous robot swarms. Using a process similar to that used by &quot;Temnothorax&quot; ants, robots can make rapid group decisions without the direction of a controller.

Despite recent advancements, the true nature of these back-and-forth conversations remains a mystery, and further rigorous research targeting inter- and intra- species communication is still necessary to maximize knowledge of quorum sensing and its potential to improve research and treatments of cancer and bacterial diseases. The code to understanding these complex bacterial languages is to decipher the impact of the words.

<text>In common usage and in philosophy, ideas are the results of thought. Also in philosophy, ideas can also be mental representational images of some object. Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being. The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings. 

An idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk about the &quot;idea&quot; of a person or a place. A new or an original idea can often lead to innovation. Our actions are based upon beliefs, beliefs are patterns or organized sets of ideas.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;idea&quot; comes from Greek , , , from the root of , .

==History==
The argument over the underlying nature of ideas is opened by Plato, whose exposition of his theory of forms—which recurs and accumulates over the course of his many dialogs—appropriates and adds a new sense to the Greek word for things that are &quot;seen&quot; (re. εἶδος) that highlights those elements of perception which are encountered without material or objective reference available to the eyes (re. ). As this argument is disseminated the word &quot;idea&quot; begins to take on connotations that would be more familiarly associated with the term today. In the fifth book of his &quot;Republic&quot;, Plato defines philosophy as the love of this formal (as opposed to visual) way of seeing.

Plato advances the theory that perceived but immaterial objects of awareness constituted a realm of deathless forms or ideas from which the material world emanated. Aristotle challenges Plato in this area, positing that the phenomenal world of ideas arises as mental composites of remembered observations. Though it is anachronistic to apply these terms to thinkers from antiquity, it clarifies the argument between Plato and Aristotle if we call Plato an idealist thinker and Aristotle an empiricist thinker.

This antagonism between empiricism and idealism generally characterizes the dynamism of the argument over the theory of ideas up to the present. This schism in theory has never been resolved to the satisfaction of thinkers from both sides of the disagreement and is represented today in the split between analytic and continental schools of philosophy. Persistent contradictions between classical physics and quantum mechanics may be pointed to as a rough analogy for the gap between the two schools of thought.

==Philosophy==

===Plato===

Plato in Ancient Greece was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (in Plato&#x27;s Greek the word &quot;idea&quot; carries a rather different sense of our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the &quot;Phaedo&quot;, &quot;Symposium&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot;, and &quot;Timaeus&quot; that there is a realm of ideas or forms (&quot;eidei&quot;), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the &quot;Republic&quot;:
===René Descartes===
Descartes often wrote of the meaning of the &quot;idea&quot; as an image or representation, often but not necessarily &quot;in the mind&quot;, which was well known in the vernacular. Despite Descartes&#x27; invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.b In his &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot; he says, &quot;Some of my thoughts are like images of things, and it is to these alone that the name &#x27;idea&#x27; properly belongs.&quot; He sometimes maintained that ideas were innate and uses of the term &quot;idea&quot; diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides &quot;ideas&quot; inconsistently into various genetic categories. For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is devoted to the consideration of these entities.

===John Locke===
John Locke&#x27;s use of idea stands in striking contrast to Plato&#x27;s. In his Introduction to An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke defines &quot;idea&quot; as &quot;that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking; And I could not avoid frequently using it.&quot; He said he regarded the contribution offered in his essay as necessary to examine our own abilities and discern what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. In this style of ideal conception other outstanding figures followed in his footsteps — Hume and Kant in the 18th century, Arthur Schopenhauer in the 19th century, and Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Karl Popper in the 20th century. Locke always believed in the &quot;good sense&quot; — not pushing things to extremes and while taking fully into account the plain facts of the matter. He prioritized common-sense ideas that struck him as &quot;good-tempered, moderate, and down-to-earth.&quot;

As John Locke studied humans in his work &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; he continually referenced Descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question: &quot;When we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge, what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right?&quot; Put in another way, he inquired into how humans might verify their ideas, and considered the distinctions between different types of ideas. Locke found that an idea &quot;can simply mean some sort of brute experience.&quot; He shows that there are &quot;No innate principles in the mind.&quot; Thus, he concludes that &quot;our ideas are all experienced in nature.&quot; An experience can either be a sensation or a reflection: &quot;consider whether there are any innate ideas in the mind before any are brought in by the impression from sensation or reflection.&quot; Therefore, an idea was an experience in which the human mind apprehended something.

In a Lockean view, there are really two types of ideas: complex and simple. Simple ideas are the building blocks for more complex ideas, and &quot;While the mind is wholly passive in the reception of simple ideas, it is very active in the building of complex ideas…&quot; Complex ideas, therefore, can either be &quot;modes&quot;, &quot;substances&quot;, or &quot;relations&quot;.

&quot;Modes&quot; combine simpler ideas in order to convey new information. For instance, David Banach gives the example of beauty as a mode. He points to combinations of color and form as qualities constitutive of this mode. &quot;Substances&quot;, however, are distinct from modes. &quot;Substances&quot; convey the underlying formal unity of certain objects, such as dogs, cats, or tables. &quot;Relations&quot; represent the relationship between two or more ideas that contain analogous elements to one another without the implication of underlying formal unity. A painting or a piece of music, for example, can both be called &#x27;art&#x27; without belonging to the same substance. They are related as forms of art (the term &#x27;art&#x27; in this illustration would be a &#x27;mode of relations&#x27;). In this way, Locke concluded that the formal ambiguity around ideas he initially sought to clarify had been resolved.

===David Hume===
Hume differs from Locke by limiting &quot;idea&quot; to only one of two possible types of perception. The other one is called &quot;impression&quot;, and is more lively: these are perceptions we have &quot;when we hear, or see, or feel, or love, or hate, or desire, or will.&quot; &quot;Ideas&quot; are more complex and are built upon these more basic and more grounded perceptions. Hume shared with Locke the basic empiricist premise that it is only from life experiences (whether their own or others&#x27;) that humans&#x27; knowledge of the existence of anything outside of themselves can be ultimately derived, that they shall carry on doing what they are prompted to do by their emotional drives of varying kinds. In choosing the means to those ends, they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas.d Hume has contended and defended the notion that &quot;reason alone is merely the &#x27;slave of the passions&#x27;.&quot;

===Immanuel Kant===

Immanuel Kant defines &quot;ideas&quot; by distinguishing them from &quot;concepts&quot;. &quot;Concepts&quot; arise by the compositing of experience into abstract categorial representations of presumed or encountered empirical objects whereas the origin of &quot;ideas,&quot; for Kant, is a priori to experience. &quot;Regulative ideas&quot;, for example, are ideals that one must tend towards, but by definition may not be completely realized as objects of empirical experience. Liberty, according to Kant, is an &quot;idea&quot; whereas &quot;tree&quot; (as an abstraction covering all species of trees) is a &quot;concept&quot;. The of the rational and universal subject is opposed to the determinism of the empirical subject. Kant felt that it is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists. The business of philosophy he thought was not to give rules, but to analyze the private judgement of good common sense.e

===Rudolf Steiner===
Whereas Kant declares limits to knowledge (&quot;we can never know the thing in itself&quot;), in his epistemological work, Rudolf Steiner sees &quot;ideas&quot; as &quot;objects of experience&quot; which the mind apprehends, much as the eye apprehends light. In &quot;Goethean Science&quot; (1883), he declares, &quot;Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye of perception perceives colors and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas.&quot; He holds this to be the premise upon which Goethe made his natural-scientific observations.

===Wilhelm Wundt===
Wundt widens the term from Kant&#x27;s usage to include &quot;conscious representation of some object or process of the external world&quot;. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of memory and imagination, but also perceptual processes, whereas other psychologists confine the term to the first two groups. One of Wundt&#x27;s main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by experiment and introspection. He regarded both of these as &quot;exact methods&quot;, interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other &quot;objectively valuable aids&quot;, specifically to &quot;those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom.&quot; Wundt designed the basic mental activity apperception — a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of assimilation and dissimilation (i.e. in color and form perception and his advocacy of &quot;objective&quot; methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends — that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
C. S. Peirce published the first full statement of pragmatism in his important works &quot;&quot; (1878) and &quot;&quot; (1877). In &quot;How to Make Our Ideas Clear&quot; he proposed that a &quot;clear idea&quot; (in his study he uses concept and &quot;idea&quot; as synonymic) is defined as one, when it is apprehended such as it will be recognized wherever it is met, and no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. He argued that to understand an idea clearly we should ask ourselves what difference its application would make to our evaluation of a proposed solution to the problem at hand. Pragmatism (a term he appropriated for use in this context), he defended, was a method for ascertaining the meaning of terms (as a theory of meaning). The originality of his ideas is in their rejection of what was accepted as a view and understanding of knowledge as impersonal facts which had been accepted by scientists for some 250 years. Peirce contended that we acquire knowledge as &quot;participants&quot;, not as &quot;spectators&quot;. He felt &quot;the real&quot;, sooner or later, is composed of information that has been acquired through ideas and knowledge and ordered by the application of logical reasoning. The rational distinction of the empirical object is not prior to its perception by a knowledgeable subject, in other words. He also published many papers on logic in relation to &quot;ideas&quot;.

===G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin===
G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin, in the &quot;Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology&quot;, define the &quot;idea&quot; as &quot;the reproduction with a more or less adequate image, of an object not actually present to the senses.&quot; They point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways. &quot;Difference in degree of intensity&quot;, &quot;comparative absence of bodily movement on the part of the subject&quot;, &quot;comparative dependence on mental activity&quot;, are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea as compared with a perception.

An idea, in the narrower and generally accepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That is, as in the example given above of the idea of a chair, a great many objects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a man, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say &quot;This is a chair, that is a stool&quot;, he has what is known as an &quot;abstract idea&quot; distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair (see abstraction). Furthermore, a complex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its particular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of actual perceptions. Thus the idea of a centaur is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of man and horse, that of a mermaid of a woman and a fish.

=== Walter Benjamin ===
&quot;Ideas are to objects [of perception] as constellations are to stars,&quot; writes Walter Benjamin in the introduction to his &quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot;. &quot;The set of concepts which assist in the representation of an idea lend it actuality as such a configuration. For phenomena are not incorporated into ideas. They are not contained in them. Ideas are, rather, their objective virtual arrangement, their objective interpretation.&quot;

Benjamin advances, &quot;That an idea is that moment in the substance and being of a word in which this word has become, and performs, as a symbol.&quot; as George Steiner summarizes. In this way &quot;techne--&quot;art and technology—may be represented, ideally, as &quot;discrete, fully autonomous objects...[thus entering] into fusion without losing their identity.&quot;

==In anthropology and the social sciences==
Diffusion studies explore the spread of ideas from culture to culture. Some anthropological theories hold that all cultures imitate ideas from one or a few original cultures, the Adam of the Bible, or several cultural circles that overlap. Evolutionary diffusion theory holds that cultures are influenced by one another but that similar ideas can be developed in isolation.

In the mid-20th century, social scientists began to study how and why ideas spread from one person or culture to another. Everett Rogers pioneered diffusion of innovations studies, using research to prove factors in adoption and profiles of adopters of ideas. In 1976, in his book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, Richard Dawkins suggested applying biological evolutionary theories to the spread of ideas. He coined the term &quot;meme&quot; to describe an abstract unit of selection, equivalent to the gene in evolutionary biology.

==Ideas and intellectual property ==
===Relationship between ideas and patents===

====On susceptibility to exclusive property====
Patent law regulates various aspects related to the functional manifestation of inventions based on new ideas or incremental improvements to existing ones. Thus, patents have a direct relationship to ideas.

===Relationship between ideas and copyrights===
In some cases, authors can be granted limited legal monopolies on the manner in which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as copyright, although the term intellectual property is used mistakenly in place of &quot;copyright&quot;. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of property upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, that may or may not carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from patent law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).

A copyright is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work, &quot;not&quot; an idea. Thus, copyrights have a negative relationship to ideas.

Work means a tangible medium of expression. It may be an original or derivative work of art, be it literary, dramatic, musical recitation, artistic, related to sound recording, etc. In (at least) countries adhering to the Berne Convention, copyright automatically starts covering the work upon the original creation and fixation thereof, without any extra steps. While creation usually involves an idea, the idea in itself does not suffice for the purposes of claiming copyright.

===Relationship of ideas to confidentiality agreements===
Confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements are legal instruments that assist corporations and individuals in keeping ideas from escaping to the general public. Generally, these instruments are covered by contract law.

<text>Neuruppin (; North Brandenburgisch: &quot;Reppin&quot;) is a town in Brandenburg, Germany, the administrative seat of Ostprignitz-Ruppin district. It is the birthplace of the novelist Theodor Fontane (1819–1898) and therefore also referred to as &quot;Fontanestadt&quot;. A garrison town since 1688 and largely rebuilt in a Neoclassical style after a devastating fire in 1787, Neuruppin has the reputation of being &quot;the most Prussian of all Prussian towns&quot;.

==Geography==
===Geographical position===
Neuruppin is one of the largest cities in Germany in terms of area. The city of Neuruppin, northwest of Berlin in the district of Ostprignitz-Ruppin (Ruppin Switzerland), consists in the south of the districts located on the shores of Ruppiner See, which is crossed by the Rhin River, including the actual core city of Neuruppin and Alt Ruppin. In the north, it stretches up to the Rheinsberg Lake Region and the border with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. It is part of the Stechlin-Ruppiner Land Nature Park and is connected to the Wittstock-Ruppiner Heide, which was partly used for military purposes as the Wittstock military training area.

=== Municipal subdivisions ===
After several annexations in 1993, Neuruppin today is one of Germany&#x27;s largest municipalities by area. The following districts and residential areas belong to Neuruppin since the annexations in 1993.

In addition, there is the deserted Krangensbrück.

===Climate===

==History==

=== Before the city fire (until 1787) ===
The prehistoric settlement of the country ranges from the Middle Stone Age through the younger Bronze Age with first Germanic, later Slavic settlements (in the old town area - including &quot;Neuer Markt&quot; - and in the surrounding countryside) on the shores of Lake Ruppin. In late Slavic times, this area was settled by the Zamzizi tribe, whose center was probably the Slawenburg Ruppin on the island of Poggenwerder near Alt Ruppin. After the Wendish Crusade in 1147 and the conquest of the land by the German nobility, around 1200 on the Amtswerder, a peninsula next to the island of Poggenwerder, the Ruppin Castle (also &quot;Planenburg&quot;) was built as a large lowland castle and political center of the Lordship of Ruppin. In the northern foreland a market settlement with Nikolai church developed, east of it and beyond the Rhin the Kietz: the town (&quot;Olden Ruppyn&quot;) Alt Ruppin had arisen.

Southwest of the castle town, the settlement of today&#x27;s Neuruppin with Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas&#x27; Church) and a street market was established at the beginning of the 13th century, keeping the name &quot;Ruppin&quot;.

The then (Neu-)Ruppin was a planned town foundation of the counts of Lindow-Ruppin, a collateral line of the Arnsteins, who resided in Alt Ruppin. The first documentary mention dates back to 1238. An expansion of the original Marktsiedlung Alt Ruppin, towards the present-day city of Neuruppin, probably took place before the foundation of the Dominican monastery in 1246 as the first settlement of the order between the Elbe and Oder rivers by the first prior Wichmann von Arnstein. The granting of the Stendal town charter took place on March 9, 1256, by Günther von Arnstein. The city was fortified in the 13th century by palisades and a rampart-ditch system, later it was fortified by walls and rampart-ditches; 24 &quot;Wiekhäuser&quot; and two high towers reinforced the city wall. In addition, there were three gates, the Altruppiner/Rheinsberger Tor in the north, the Berliner/Bechliner Tor in the south and the Seetor in the east. The complete walled enclosure occurred at the latest towards the end of the 15th century.

Neuruppin&#x27;s oldest part was an elongated Anger, accompanied by two parallel streets between the southern and northern city gates, in the south on it the oldest church of Neuruppin (St. Nikolai). The main street of Neuruppin was pavement since the middle of the 16th century. Across Neuruppin, from the northwest toward the lake, ran the Klappgraben, coming from the Ruppiner Mesche, to supply the city with service water and for drainage, which was partially filled in 1537 and renewed as an open canal in Schinkelstraße after the city fire of 1787.

In the Middle Ages, Neuruppin was one of the larger northeastern German cities. Preserved from this period are, among other things, parts of the city wall, parts of the monastery church of St. Trinitatis (1246), St. George&#x27;s Chapel (1362), the leprosorium (1490) with the St. Lazarus Chapel consecrated in 1491, as well as remains of the lake district. The medieval city had a nearly square ground plan of about 700 m × 700 m, which blunts conspicuously at the eastern corner. The east-southeast side borders on the Ruppiner Lake.

In 1512, to celebrate a peace treaty, Elector Joachim I organized a three-day jousting tournament in Neuruppin. After the extinction of the Counts of Lindow-Ruppin in 1524, Neuruppin came to the Elector Joachim I as a settled fief. The Thirty Years&#x27; War also devastated Neuruppin. In the course of the Reformation, the monastery property fell to the elector around 1540. In 1564, he donated the monastery to the city. During this time, a legend depicted in the monastery church about a mouse chasing a rat, which is interpreted as a sign that the church would remain Lutheran in the future.

A Latin school was first documented in Neuruppin in 1365, which at times had supra-regional importance. Its history is well documented since 1477. In 1777 Philipp Julius Lieberkühn and Johann Stuve took over the school administration and reformed the school in the Basedowsche Sense, which received general attention.

In 1688 Neuruppin became one of the first garrison towns in Brandenburg. It was here that Crown Prince Frederick was imprisoned from 1732 to 1740 after his unsuccessful escape attempt and subsequent imprisonment in Küstrin. Holder of the Regiment on Foot Crown Prince. During this time, Bernhard Feldmann city physicist. His transcripts of historically interesting council records are considered the most important collection of sources on early town history, as the original records were destroyed in the town fire of 1787. At times the number of soldiers and civilian troop members was 1500 out of 3500 inhabitants. Neuruppin only lost this status with the withdrawal of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany.

After 1685, French Huguenots settled there. From 1740 the organ builder Gottlieb Scholtze had his workshop in Neuruppin, who among other things built the organ in Rheinsberg.

=== City fire and reconstruction (1787-1803) ===

A break in the development of the town was the wildfire of Sunday, August 26, 1787. The fire broke out in a barn filled with grain at the Bechliner Tor in the afternoon and spread rapidly. Only two narrow areas on the eastern and western edges of the city remained. A total of 401 bourgeois houses, 159 outbuildings and outhouses, 228 stables and 38 barns, the parish church of St. Mary, the town hall, the Reformed church, and the Prince&#x27;s Palace were destroyed. Property damage was estimated at nearly 600,000 talers. The Fire Fund replaced about 220,000 thalers, a special church collection yielded 60,000 thalers, and the Prussian Government provided 130,000 thalers of funding for the reconstruction of the city. In total, the state spent over one million thalers in the following years.

The city planning director Bernhard Matthias Brasch (1741-1821), who had been active in the city since 1783, implemented the specifications of the reconstruction commission and supervised the corresponding works. These took place from 1788 to 1803, following a uniformly planned ground plan. Brasch&#x27;s plan envisaged the expansion of the city from 46 to almost 61 hectares with the removal of the ramparts between the Tempelgarten and the lake. The two north–south streets, which were close together, were united into one axis, later Karl-Marx-Strasse. A rectangular network of streets with continuous two-story troughshouses was created. Long wide streets interrupted by stately plazas, and houses in a transformation architecture mixing Baroque, Mannerist and Gothic design elements with Neoclassical trends, have shaped the townscape since that time. These urban reform principles are well recognizable. Thus, with the reconstruction, a classicist city layout unique in this originality was created. The reconstruction was already completed in 1803. Only the completion of the parish church of St. Mary (built 1801-1806 by Philipp Bernard François Berson with the collaboration of Carl Ludwig Engel) dragged on until 1806 due to structural problems.

After the disastrous fire in 1787, the neo-classicism of the rebuilt town&#x27;s buildings have characterised its townscape to the present day. It remained a garrison town until the late 20th century, since Soviet troops were stationed here until 1993; during this time, there were as many Soviet soldiers as inhabitants in Neuruppin.

=== Reconstruction in the 19th century (1804-1900) ===

Johann Bernhard Kühn (1750-1826) began producing picture sheets in Neuruppin, thematically designed and for a long time as hand-colored broadsides. His son Gustav Kühn (1794-1868) achieved print runs of sometimes over three million copies per year (e.g., the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71). The prints became known worldwide with the inscription &quot;Neu-Ruppin, zu haben bei Gustav Kühn&quot;. Three other companies produced the popular picture sheets: Philipp Oehmigke, Hermann Riemschneider, and Friedrich Wilhelm Bergemann. All three picture sheet producers managed to hold their own in the German picture sheet manufacturer competition (more than 60 companies throughout Germany) and to occupy the leading positions for a long time.

From 1815 to 1945, Neuruppin was part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. In September 1820, the Infantry Regiment 24 came to Neuruppin with its staff and two battalions, while the Fusilier Battalion took up garrison in Prenzlau. The regiment had been raised elsewhere in 1813, and had participated in the wars of liberation and the occupation of France. Initially, the regiment was housed in Neuruppin burghers&#x27; quarters.

In 1877, the organ builder Albert Hollenbach set up his workshop in Neuruppin. His works include organs in the churches of the districts of Bechlin, Buskow, Karwe, Nietwerder and Storbeck as well as the Siechenhauskapelle in the old town of Neuruppin. After 1880, Neuruppin became the center of a branch line network, which was operated by the Ruppiner Eisenbahn AG until 1945. This radiated to Fehrbellin-Paulinenaue (1880), Kremmen-Berlin and Wittstock-Meyenburg (1899), and Neustadt and Herzberg respectively (1905). For this purpose, a railroad embankment was built across the Ruppiner See, cutting across the lake 2.5 kilometers from the north shore in an east–west direction.

In 1893, the Neuruppin State Lunatic Asylum was built on the southern edge of the central city.

=== The city in the 20th century ===

Fire extinguishers have been manufactured in Neuruppin since 1905. Minimax fire extinguishers in particular quickly became widespread due to their ease of use. During World War I, an aviation squadron was stationed in Neuruppin and an airfield was established. In 1921, an open-air settlement was founded in the Gildenhall district by master builder and settlement engineer Georg Heyer (1880-1944), whose goal was to gather artists and artisans to live and work together in order to create and produce everyday products affordable to all and in artisanal form. It attracted many renowned artists and artisans, and existed until 1929.

In 1926, the road next to the railroad embankment across Lake Ruppin was completed. The settlements Gildenhall and Kolonie Wuthenow thus received a direct connection to Neuruppin. In 1929, these settlements were incorporated, after the Treskow estate district had already been incorporated in 1928.[9]

After the Nazis seized power in June 1933, more than 80 political opponents of the regime, mainly Social Democrats, Jews, and Communists, were taken to a provisional prison run by the SA within the buildings of a brewery on Altruppiner Allee, which had been shut down at that time. SA members tortured and mistreated many of the prisoners here. They are commemorated by a memorial stone created during the Soviet occupation in 1947 and by the ensemble of figures created in 1981 at the behest of the SED district leadership, which replaced the original memorial on Schulplatz.
In 1934, the Neuruppin military airfield was revived as the &quot;Fliegerschule Neuruppin&quot;.

The city&#x27;s approximately 90 Jewish citizens were persecuted, deported, and murdered during the Nazi era. Their Old Cemetery, established in 1824, was treated relatively leniently; preserved Jewish gravestones were moved to the New Cemetery (Protestant Cemetery) by order of the then regimental commander of the Wehrmacht, Paul von Hase. Since November 17, 2003, Stolpersteine (&quot;stumbling stones&quot;) markers in the core city and in Alt-Ruppin have commemorated the murdered Jewish residents.

For the Aktion T4 mass murder campaign of those deemed physically infirm during the National Socialist era, the Neuruppin State Lunatic Asylum served as an intermediate facility for the Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre and the Bernburg Euthanasia Centre. Therefore, the number of patients increased from 1,971 on January 1, 1937, to 4,197 on April 1, 1940. In 1941, only 1,147 of the 1,797 planned beds were still occupied. In 1943, the greater part of the patients were transferred to other institutions in Aktion Brandt. The hospital was also partly used as a reserve hospital during World War II. After 1945, parts of the facility served as a district hospital. On September 20, 2004, six Stolpersteine were laid on the grounds of the Ruppiner Kliniken in memory of the euthanasia victims of the former state lunatic asylum.

On May 1, 1945, Soviet forces reached Neuruppin and prepared to shell the city from the opposite shore of the lake. However, an unknown person managed to raise a white flag on the tower of the monastery church, and the same happened at the parish church. This prevented any destruction. A Soviet cemetery of honor was established north of the Rheinsberger Tor train station, where more than 220 Soviet soldiers were buried.

Neuruppin became one of the largest garrisons of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSSD). The Soviet forces used the military airfield located immediately north of the central city, whose operation caused considerable noise pollution in the city. In 1989, massive demonstrations by Neuruppin residents in connection with plans for the continued use of the Wittstock military training and air-to-ground firing range led to the closure of the airfield.

Until about 1950, the theater Die neue Bühne was located in the city center. It was operated as part of the state association of the German People&#x27;s Stage and had up to 95 employees.

In 1951, the Elektro-Physikalische Werkstätten was founded in Neuruppin as a producer of electronic components. From 1970, they were expanded as Elektro-Physikalische Werke (EPW) to become the largest printed circuit board manufacturer in the GDR, employing up to 3,500 workers. Later, the plant was an integral part of the Kombinat Mikroelektronik. In the GDR era, the children&#x27;s summer camp &quot;Frohe Zukunft DDR&quot; was located in Gühlen-Glinicke.

In 1952, Neuruppin became the district town of the district of the same name in Bezirk Potsdam as a result of the GDR district reform.

As a result of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the peaceful revolution in the GDR, the state of Brandenburg was reestablished in 1990, while the district of Neuruppin remained in existence for the time being.

==== Neuruppin as a socialist district town 1970-1989 ====

Plans for the development of a modern district town with up to 100,000 inhabitants were made from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. The basis for this was the planned industrial and administrative development of the district town of Neuruppin. Beginning in the 1970s, VEB Elektrophysikalische Werke Neuruppin was established to handle all printed circuit board production for the GDR&#x27;s microelectronics and entertainment technology industries. The VEB Feuerlöschgerätewerke Neuruppin, as the main producer of hand-held fire extinguishers for the Eastern Bloc countries united in the CMEA, and the Volkseigene Backwarenkombinat, as the main producer of all kinds of baked goods for the district town and the district of Neuruppin, were expanded considerably.

All this required the influx of highly qualified management, research, and development personnel as well as many thousands of workers. The resident core population of Neuruppin until the end of the 1960s was not sufficient for this. Planning also took into account Neuruppin&#x27;s convenient location at the intersection of four important branch lines of the Deutsche Reichsbahn with favorable north–south connections for freight and passenger traffic and the Berlin-Rostock/Hamburg highway (now the A24 and A19), which was in planning and later under construction. The plans for a socialist district town included the construction of several residential complexes outside the town&#x27;s settlement area, which existed until 1968, and the transformation of the old town, which was located outside the medieval city walls. Due to the dwindling economic power of the socialist planned economy of the GDR, only the following urban development projects were implemented from the 1970s onwards:

* Construction of the &quot;VEB Elektrophysikalische Werke Neuruppin&quot;.
* Construction of the &quot;Volkseigene Kombinat Backwaren Neuruppin&quot; (People&#x27;s Own Bakery Combine Neuruppin)
* Expansion of the &quot;VEB Feuerlöschgerätewerk Neuruppin&quot; (VEB fire extinguisher plant)
* 1961: Construction of the polyclinic (Neustädter Straße) for medical care
* 1970-1974: Construction of the housing complex (WK) I Junckerstraße / Thomas-Mann-Straße / Franz-Maecker-Straße (GDR housing construction series IW 64 type Brandenburg / Markkleeberg)
* 1970-1972: Construction of the road axes E-Strasse (initially without a name E-Strasse = relief road around the city center, since 1973 Heinrich-Rau-Strasse) and the feeder roads north and south to the highway (today A 24),
* 1972: Establishment of a public transport system that still operates according to a regular timetable through the Neuruppin city bus line.
* 1972-1974: Construction of the housing complex (WK) II Hermann-Matern-Straße / Erich-Schulz-Straße / August-Fischer-Straße / Anna-Hausen-Straße (GDR housing series IW 64 type Brandenburg / Markkleeberg)
* 1970-1974: construction and opening of children&#x27;s combinations (crèche and kindergarten) in housing complexes I and II, construction and opening of Polytechnic Secondary School Theodor Fontane / Karl-Liebknecht and Extended Secondary School Karl-Friedrich Schinkel, opening of department stores in housing complexes I and II
* 1978-1980: Expansion of residential complex I through gap construction (GDR housing construction series WBS 70) between WK I (Junckerstraße) and WK II (Hermann-Matern-Straße), as of 1982, the addition of delicatessen, fruit and vegetable store and residential area restaurant in combination with FDJ youth club 019 (today club disco and night bar &quot;Club 019&quot;), construction of the community center in residential complex II as a residential area restaurant, event hall and student dining hall of the POS Theodor Fontane / Karl Liebknecht
* 1980-1991: Construction of the residential complex III (GDR housing construction series WBS 70) Heinrich-Rau-Straße / Bruno-Salvat-Straße / Otto-Grotewohl-Straße / Otto-Winzer-Straße / Rudolf-Wendt-Straße, partly with apartments for senior citizens.

The historic old town of Neuruppin was spared further redesigns during GDR times for reasons of cost. The construction of a four-lane expressway following the model of an automotive city - leading from Fehrbelliner Strasse along the present Regattastrasse via Bollwerk, crossing Seedamm / Steinstrasse, in the direction of Wittstocker Allee - was opposed by financial constraints in the GDR. The relocation of the VEB Feuerlöschgerätewerk Neuruppin and the compensation for the areas and buildings between Bollwerk and the VEB Feuerlöschgerätewerk which had been taken up by the Soviet Army, did not help the economic power of the GDR in the mid-1970s.

==== The 1970s ====
Neuruppin grew from a small town with about 18,000 inhabitants to 33,000 inhabitants between 1970 and 1989 through the settlement and expansion of technology and industry, which was economically significant for the GDR and the RGW states and as exports to the NSW (non-socialist economic area) in exchange for foreign currency, due to an influx of differently educated people from all parts of the GDR. Added to this were the many foreign workers and apprentices from the allied socialist states of Vietnam, Angola, Cuba, and the Soviet armed forces stationed there with around 12,000 men (including their families). Thus, a diverse population developed in the new housing complex developments I to III.

==== The Old Town of Neuruppin 1980-1990 ====

For reasons of cost, the old town of Neuruppin was spared the planned modern redesigns, but it deteriorated noticeably by the end of the 1970s. Beginning in the 1980s, the SED of the GDR began to reflect on the cities&#x27; historical past. Thus, from 1980 to 1986, the old town of Neuruppin was redeveloped according to the classicist model with the cooperation of then-mayor Harald Lemke.

==== Future Residential Complex I to III ====
Contrary to the trend after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 in the state of Brandenburg, no residential buildings were demolished in residential complexes I to III. All apartments in residential complexes I to III Neuruppin are 100% in municipal or cooperative management (statistics as of 2015) and 99% are rented.

==== Neuruppin after the incorporation in 1993 ====
When the new districts were formed, which came into effect on December 6, 1993, the district of Neuruppin was absorbed into the district of Ostprignitz-Ruppin. On the same day, Neuruppin was significantly enlarged by incorporating the town of Alt Ruppin as well as the communities of Buskow, Gnewikow, Gühlen-Glienicke, Karwe, Krangen, Lichtenberg, Molchow, Nietwerder, Radensleben, Stöffin, Wulkow and Wuthenow. Until 1991, Neuruppin was still the location of the 12th Soviet Armored Division. The barracks were later converted into residential buildings as part of the Expo 2000 outdoor project. Parts of the airfield are now still used for gliding.

In 1996, the then Neuruppin Regional Clinic and the District Hospital passed into the ownership of the Ostprignitz-Ruppin district as parts of the Ruppiner Kliniken GmbH. The Ruppiner Kliniken are thus one of the largest regional employers. The Protestant church districts of Ruppin and Wittstock/Dosse merged in 1998, and Neuruppin lost the seat of the superintendent to Wittstock as a result.

On March 11, 1998, the city was awarded the additional designation of Fontanestadt. On January 1, 2001, the focal public prosecutor&#x27;s office for corruption was established in Neuruppin as the successor to the department for GDR injustices and district crime. It is responsible for corruption offenses throughout the state of Brandenburg.

On September 7, 2002, the 7th Brandenburg Day was held in Neuruppin with approximately 230,000 visitors. In response to the Elbe flood in July 2002 in Saxony, numerous artists such as Udo Lindenberg and Gerhard Schöne donated their fees in support of the flood victims. In May 2009, it became public knowledge for the first time that the groundwater under a new development area at Ruppiner See was contaminated with halogenated hydrocarbons. The district of Ostprignitz-Ruppin, as the responsible environmental authority, admitted to having known about the environmental contamination since 1999 through measurements taken during earlier construction projects.

On May 12, 2011, the iodine-containing thermal brine pool in Neuruppin received the first state recognition of a medicinal spring in the state of Brandenburg. The thermal brine pool is used by the Fontane-Therme on the edge of the old town for wellness operations and heating purposes.

==Demography==


Territorial status of the respective year, number of inhabitants: as of December 31 (from 1991), from 2011 on the basis of the 2011 census.

==Politics==
===City Council===
The city council of Neuruppin comprises 30 city councilors and the full-time mayor. The municipal election on May 26, 2019, with a voter turnout of 49.0%, resulted in the following:

The AfD accounted for four seats in line with its share of the vote, two of which remain unoccupied because the party nominated only two candidates. The CDU and FDP have joined forces to form a parliamentary group, as have Bündnis 90/Die Grünen and the voters&#x27; group Kreisbauernverband.

=== Mayors ===
==== Before the city reform ====
* around 1786: Goering

==== After the city reform in 1808 ====
==== After the annexations in 1993 ====
* 1994–2004: Otto Theel
* 2005-2020: Jens-Peter Golde
* since 2020: Nico Ruhle

Ruhle was elected to an eight-year term in the November 29, 2020 mayoral runoff election with 56.7% of the valid votes.

=== Dealing with corruption ===
In 2004, Neuruppin made headlines for corruption and nepotism. In view of the growing scandals in local politics, the city acquired derogatory nicknames such as &quot;Märkisches Palermo&quot; or &quot;Klein Palermo&quot; and &quot;Korruppin&quot; as it struggled with battling corruption.

The former CDU city councilor Olaf Kamrath was legally sentenced in 2006 as the head of the XY gang to many years in prison for, among other things, gang-related narcotics offences. In 2007, the verdict against former city councilor Reinhard Sommerfeld (Neuruppiner Initiative) was the only legally binding conviction of an elected official in Germany for bribery of members of parliament to date. The former state parliament member Otto Sommerfeld was convicted of bribery of members of parliament.

On May 15, 2008, former state parliament member Otto Theel (Die Linke) was given a nine-month suspended prison sentence for taking advantage in office during his term as mayor of Neuruppin. He subsequently resigned his seat in the state parliament. In September 2008, Sparkasse Ostprignitz-Ruppin parted ways with its previous CEO Josef Marckhoff, who had his employer throw him a circa 55,000 euro celebration to mark his own 60th birthday. The date coincided with the company&#x27;s 160th anniversary.

The former managing director of the municipal public utility company Neuruppin Dietmar Lenz was sentenced to a suspended prison sentence of two years on March 19, 2009, on charges of a serious breach of trust and acceptance of benefits, having spent more than 500,000 euros bypassing the supervisory board to support the sports club MSV Neuruppin. At the end of 2009 he committed suicide. A citizens&#x27; initiative initiated with the help of the two relevantly previously convicted Otto Theel and Reinhard Sommerfeld a deselection petition against Mayor Jens-Peter Golde. Golde was accused by the citizens&#x27; petition &quot;Kein weiter so!&quot; of lacking leadership quality, failing to fulfill his election program and endangering jobs in Neuruppin. It failed by its own account in February 2010 with 5079 of the required 5300 signatures.

As of January 1, 2016, Neuruppin became the sixth corporate municipal member of Transparency International, along with Bonn, Hamm (Westphalia), Potsdam, Leipzig, and Halle (Saale).

=== Neuruppin remains colorful ===
In the run-up to a planned demonstration of radical right-wing groups in the core city of Neuruppin on September 1, 2007, the non-partisan action alliance &quot;Neuruppin bleibt bunt&quot; formed and organized a counter-event with about 1000 participants. On September 5, 2009, in view of another planned demonstration of radical right-wing groups, the action alliance organized a series of actions for civil courage along the demonstration route. On March 27, 2010, Neuruppin bleibt bunt organized the democracy festival Demokratie im Quadrat with 2,000 participants in the face of a demonstration march by the radical right-wing Freie Kräfte Neuruppin with 350 participants.

On June 6, 2011, the action alliance received the &quot;Band für Mut und Verständigung&quot; award for its work. In November 2011, a party convention of the NPD took place in Neuruppin under protest of &quot;Neuruppin bleibt bunt&quot; against the will of the city. The action alliance was able, through broad civil society engagement, with cultural stage program on the school square and a blockade for the first time to stop the so-called &quot;Day of the German Future&quot;. The far-right Freie Kräfte Neuruppin/Osthavelland had organized the demonstration for June 6, 2015.

=== Coat of arms ===
In § 2 para 1 and 2 of the main statutes of the city of Neuruppin states:

The coat of arms was confirmed on March 31, 2003.

Blazon: &quot;In blue a silver castle with two pinned, two-storey towers with two superimposed black gates and gold-knobbed, red pointed roofs; the central building with three turrets and a black gate, which is covered by a red triangular shield, topped with a gold-armed and gold-tongued silver eagle.&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Epimetheus (; ) is the brother of Prometheus, the pair serving &quot;as representatives of mankind&quot;. Both sons of the Titan Iapetus, while Prometheus (&quot;foresight&quot;) is ingeniously clever, Epimetheus (&quot;hindsight&quot;) is inept and foolish. In some accounts of the myth, Epimetheus unleashes the unforeseen troubles in Pandora&#x27;s box.

==Mythology==
According to Plato&#x27;s use of the old myth in his &quot;Protagoras&quot; (320d–322a), the two Titan brothers were entrusted with distributing the traits among the newly created animals. Epimetheus was responsible for giving a positive trait to every animal, but when it was time to give man a positive trait, lacking &quot;foresight&quot; he found that there was nothing left. Prometheus decided that humankind&#x27;s attributes would be the civilising arts and fire, which he stole from Athena and Hephaestus. Prometheus later stood trial for his crime. In the context of Plato&#x27;s dialogue, &quot;Epimetheus, the being in whom thought follows production, represents nature in the sense of materialism, according to which thought comes later than thoughtless bodies and their thoughtless motions.&quot;

According to Hesiod, who related the tale twice (&quot;Theogony&quot;, 527ff; &quot;Works and Days&quot; 57ff), Epimetheus was the one who accepted the gift of Pandora from the gods. Their marriage may be inferred (and was by later authors), but it is not made explicit in either text. In later myths, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora was Pyrrha, who married Deucalion, a descendant of Prometheus. Together they are the only two humans who survived the deluge. In some accounts, Epimetheus had another daughter, Metameleia, whose name means &quot;regret of what has occurred&quot; for those that do not plan ahead will only feel sorrow when calamity strikes. According to a scholion (marginal comment) on Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;, Eumelos states that Epimetheus&#x27; wife was called Ephyra, daughter of Oceanus and Tethys.

==In modern culture==
In his seminal book &quot;Psychological Types&quot;, in Chapter X, &quot;General description of the types&quot;, Carl Jung uses the image of Epimetheus (with direct reference to Carl Spitteler&#x27;s Epimetheus) to refer to the false application of a mental function, as opposed to its whole, healthy, and creative use.

In the video game &quot;Astalon: Tears of the Earth&quot;, Epimetheus is represented as the &quot;Titan of Death&quot;. A malevolent yet somewhat honorable supernatural being linked to one of the main characters of the game (the wizard Algus) with a pact.

<text>Epimetheus is an inner satellite of Saturn. It is also known as Saturn XI. It is named after the mythological Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus.

== Discovery ==

Epimetheus occupies essentially the same orbit as the moon Janus. Astronomers originally assumed that there was only one body in that orbit, disbelieving that two moons could share nearly identical orbits without eventually colliding. Thus, there was difficulty in determining their orbital characteristics. Observations were photographic and spaced widely apart in time, so that while the presence of two objects was obvious, the observations were difficult to reconcile with a reasonable orbit.

Audouin Dollfus observed a moon on 15 December 1966, which he proposed to be named &quot;Janus&quot;. On 18 December, Richard Walker made a similar observation which is now credited as the discovery of Epimetheus. However, at the time, it was believed that there was only one moon, unofficially known as &quot;Janus&quot;, in the given orbit.

Twelve years later, in October 1978, Stephen M. Larson and John W. Fountain realised that the 1966 observations were best explained by two distinct objects (Janus and Epimetheus) sharing very similar orbits. This was confirmed in 1980 by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and so Larson and Fountain officially share the discovery of Epimetheus with Walker. A moon that was probably Epimetheus appeared in two &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; images and was designated S/1979S1, there is uncertainty though because the two images were not enough to allow a reliable orbit to be calculated.

Epimetheus received its name in 1983. The name Janus was approved by the IAU at the same time, although the name had been used informally since Dollfus proposed it shortly after the 1966 discovery.

== Orbit ==

Epimetheus&#x27;s orbit is co-orbital with that of Janus. Janus&#x27;s mean orbital radius from Saturn is, as of 2006 (as shown by the green color in the adjacent picture), only 50 km less than that of Epimetheus, a distance smaller than either moon&#x27;s mean radius. In accordance with Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion, the closer orbit is completed more quickly. Because of the small difference, it is completed in only about 30 seconds less. Each day, the inner moon is an additional 0.25° farther around Saturn than the outer moon. As the inner moon catches up to the outer moon, their mutual gravitational attraction increases the inner moon&#x27;s momentum and decreases that of the outer moon. This added momentum means that the inner moon&#x27;s distance from Saturn and orbital period are increased, and the outer moon&#x27;s are decreased. The timing and magnitude of the momentum exchange is such that the moons effectively swap orbits, never approaching closer than about 10,000 km. At each encounter Janus&#x27;s orbital radius changes by ~20 km and Epimetheus&#x27;s by ~80 km: Janus&#x27;s orbit is less affected because it is four times more massive than Epimetheus. The exchange takes place approximately every four years; the last close approaches occurred in January 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018. This is the only such orbital configuration of moons known in the Solar System (Though asteroids are known to participate in horseshoe orbits).

The orbital relationship between Janus and Epimetheus can be understood in terms of the circular restricted three-body problem, as a case in which the two moons (the third body being Saturn) are similar in size to each other.

== Physical characteristics ==
There are several Epimethean craters larger than 30 km in diameter, as well as both large and small ridges and grooves. The extensive cratering indicates that Epimetheus must be quite old. Janus and Epimetheus may have formed from a disruption of a single parent to form co-orbital satellites, but if this is the case the disruption must have happened early in the history of the satellite system. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Epimetheus is a very porous icy body. There is considerable uncertainty in these values, however, and so this remains to be confirmed.

The south pole is dominated by a large, flat basin with a central peak that covers much of the moon&#x27;s southern hemisphere, which may be the remains of a large impact crater.

There appear to be two terrain types: darker, smoother areas, and brighter, slightly more yellowish, fractured terrain. One interpretation is that the darker material evidently moves down slopes, and probably has a lower ice content than the brighter material, which appears more like &quot;bedrock&quot;. Nonetheless, materials in both terrains are likely to be rich in water ice.

===Features===
Craters on Epimetheus, like those on Janus, are named after characters in the legend of Castor and Pollux.

The first has been misspelled &#x27;Hilairea&#x27; at USGS, which would presumably be pronounced .

== Interactions with rings ==
A faint dust ring is present around the region occupied by the orbits of Epimetheus and Janus, as revealed by images taken in forward-scattered light by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft in 2006. The ring has a radial extent of about 5000 km. Its source are particles blasted off their surfaces by meteoroid impacts, which then form a diffuse ring around their orbital paths.

Along with Janus, Epimetheus acts as a shepherd moon, maintaining the sharp outer edge of the A Ring in a 7:6 orbital resonance. The effect is more obvious when the more massive Janus is on the resonant (inner) orbit.

<text>Cellophane is a thin, transparent sheet made of regenerated cellulose. Its low permeability to air, oils, greases, bacteria, and liquid water makes it useful for food packaging. Cellophane is highly permeable to water vapour, but may be coated with nitrocellulose lacquer to prevent this.

Cellophane is also used in transparent pressure-sensitive tape, tubing, and many other similar applications.

Cellophane is compostable and biodegradable, and can be obtained from biomaterials. The original production process uses carbon disulfide (CS2), which has been found to be highly toxic to workers. The newer lyocell process can be used to produce cellulose film without involving carbon disulfide.

&quot;Cellophane&quot; is a generic term in some countries, while in other countries it is a registered trademark.

==Production==
Cellulose from wood, cotton, hemp, or other sources is dissolved in alkali and carbon disulfide to make a solution called viscose, which is then extruded through a slit into a bath of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate to reconvert the viscose into cellulose. The film is then passed through several more baths, one to remove sulfur, one to bleach the film, and one to add softening materials such as glycerin to prevent the film from becoming brittle.

A similar process, using a hole (a spinneret) instead of a slit, is used to make a fibre called rayon. Chemically, cellophane, rayon, and cellulose are polymers of glucose; they differ structurally rather than chemically.

==History==

Cellophane was invented by Swiss chemist Jacques E. Brandenberger while employed by &quot;Blanchisserie et Teinturerie de Thaon&quot;. In 1900, inspired by seeing wine spill on a restaurant&#x27;s tablecloth, he decided to create a cloth that could repel liquids rather than absorb them. His first step was to spray a waterproof coating onto fabric, and he opted to try viscose. The resultant coated fabric was far too stiff, but the film coating could be separated from the backing cloth easily and in one undamaged piece. Seeing the possibilities of this new material on its own, Brandenberger soon abandoned his original idea.

It took ten years for Brandenberger to perfect his film. His chief improvement over earlier work with such films was adding glycerin to soften the material. By 1912 he had constructed a machine to manufacture the film, which he had named Cellophane, from the words &quot;cellulose&quot; and &quot;diaphane&quot; (&quot;transparent&quot;). Cellophane was patented that year. The following year, the company Comptoir des Textiles Artificiels (CTA) bought the Thaon firm&#x27;s interest in Cellophane and established Brandenberger in a new company, La Cellophane SA.
Whitman&#x27;s candy company initiated use of cellophane for candy wrapping in the United States in 1912 for their Whitman&#x27;s Sampler. They remained the largest user of imported cellophane from France until nearly 1924, when DuPont built the first cellophane manufacturing plant in the US. Cellophane saw limited sales in the US at first since while it was waterproof, it was not moisture proof—it held or repelled water but was permeable to water vapor. This meant that it was unsuited to packaging products that required moisture proofing. DuPont hired chemist William Hale Charch (1898–1958), who spent three years developing a nitrocellulose lacquer that, when applied to Cellophane, made it moisture proof. Following the introduction of moisture-proof Cellophane in 1927, the material&#x27;s sales tripled between 1928 and 1930, and in 1938, Cellophane accounted for 10% of DuPont&#x27;s sales and 25% of its profits.

Cellophane played a crucial role in developing the self-service retailing of fresh meat. Cellophane visibility helped customers know quality of meat before buying. Cellophane also worked to consumers&#x27; disadvantage when manufacturers learned to manipulate the appearance of a product by controlling oxygen and moisture levels to prevent discolouration of food. It was considered such a useful invention that cellophane was listed alongside other modern marvels in the 1934 song &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot; (from &quot;Anything Goes&quot;).

The British textile company Courtaulds&#x27; viscose technology had allowed it to diversify in 1930 into viscose film, which it named &quot;Viscacelle&quot;. However, competition with Cellophane was an obstacle to its sales, and in 1935 it founded British Cellophane Limited (BCL) in conjunction with the Cellophane Company and its French parent company CTA. A major production facility was constructed at Bridgwater, Somerset, England, from 1935 to 1937, employing 3,000 workers. BCL subsequently constructed plants in Cornwall, Ontario (BCL Canada), as an adjunct to the existing Courtaulds viscose rayon plant there (from which it bought the viscose solution), and in 1957 at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The latter two plants were closed in the 1990s.

==Today==

Cellulose film has been manufactured continuously since the mid-1930s and is still used today. As well as packaging a variety of food items, there are also industrial applications, such as a base for such self-adhesive tapes as Sellotape and Scotch Tape, a semi-permeable membrane in a certain type of battery, as dialysis tubing (Visking tubing), and as a release agent in the manufacture of fibreglass and rubber products. Cellophane is the most popular material for manufacturing cigar packaging; its permeability to water vapor makes cellophane a good product for this application as cigars must be allowed to &quot;breathe&quot; while wrapped and in storage.

Cellophane sales have dwindled since the 1960s, due to alternative packaging options. The polluting effects of carbon disulfide and other by-products of the process used to make viscose may have also contributed to its falling behind lower cost petrochemical-based films such as biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (BoPET) and biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) in the 1980s and 1990s. However, as of 2017, it has made something of a resurgence in recent times due to its being biosourced, compostable, and biodegradable. Its sustainability record is clouded by its energy-intensive manufacturing process and the potential negative impact of some of the chemicals used, but significant progress in recent years has been made by leading manufacturers in reducing their environmental footprint.

==Material properties==
When placed between two plane polarizing filters, cellophane produces prismatic colours due to its birefringent nature. Artists have used this effect to create stained glass-like creations that are kinetic and interactive.

Cellophane is biodegradable, but highly toxic carbon disulfide is used in most cellophane production. Viscose factories vary widely in the amount of CS2 they expose their workers to, and most give no information about their quantitative safety limits or how well they keep to them.

==Branding==
In the UK and in many other countries, &quot;Cellophane&quot; is a registered trademark and the property of Futamura Chemical UK Ltd, based in Wigton, Cumbria, United Kingdom. In the USA and some other countries &quot;cellophane&quot; has become genericized, and is often used informally to refer to a wide variety of plastic film products, even those not made of cellulose, such as PVC-based plastic wrap.

<doc id="162017" wikidata="Q910194" url="?curid=162017" title="Rayon">
<text>Rayon, also called viscose and commercialised in some countries as sabra silk or cactus silk, is a semi-synthetic fiber made from natural sources of regenerated cellulose, such as wood and related agricultural products. It has the same molecular structure as cellulose. Many types and grades of viscose fibers and films exist. Some imitate the feel and texture of natural fibers such as silk, wool, cotton, and linen. The types that resemble silk are often called artificial silk. It can be woven or knit to make textiles for clothing and other purposes.

Rayon production involves solubilizing cellulose to allow turning the fibers into required form. Three common solubilization methods are:

* The cuprammonium process (not in use today), using ammoniacal solutions of copper salts
* The viscose process, the most common today, using alkali and carbon disulfide
* The Lyocell process, using amine oxide, which avoids producing neurotoxic carbon disulfide but is more expensive

== History ==

French scientist and industrialist Hilaire de Chardonnet (1838–1924) invented the first artificial textile fiber, &quot;artificial silk&quot;.

Swiss chemist Matthias Eduard Schweizer (1818–1860) discovered that cellulose dissolved in tetraamminecopper dihydroxide. Max Fremery and Johann Urban developed a method to produce carbon fibers for use in light bulbs in 1897. Production of cuprammonium rayon for textiles started in 1899 in the Vereinigte Glanzstoff Fabriken AG in Oberbruch (near Aachen). Improvement by J. P. Bemberg AG in 1904 made the artificial silk a product comparable to real silk.

English chemist Charles Frederick Cross and his collaborators, Edward John Bevan and Clayton Beadle, patented their artificial silk in 1894. They named it &quot;viscose&quot; because its production involved the intermediacy of a highly viscous solution. Cross and Bevan took out British Patent No. 8,700, &quot;Improvements in Dissolving Cellulose and Allied Compounds&quot; in May, 1892. In 1893, they formed the Viscose Syndicate to grant licences and, in 1896, formed the British Viscoid Co. Ltd.

The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the UK company Courtaulds Fibres in November 1905. Courtaulds formed an American division, American Viscose (later known as Avtex Fibers), to produce their formulation in the US in 1910. The name &quot;rayon&quot; was adopted in 1924, with &quot;viscose&quot; being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane. In Europe, though, the fabric itself became known as &quot;viscose&quot;, which has been ruled an acceptable alternative term for rayon by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Rayon was produced only as a filament fiber until the 1930s, when methods were developed to utilize &quot;broken waste rayon&quot; as staple fiber.

Manufacturers&#x27; search for a less environmentally-harmful process for making Rayon led to the development of the lyocell method for producing Rayon. The lyocell process was developed in 1972 by a team at the now defunct American Enka fibers facility at Enka, North Carolina. In 2003, the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) awarded Neal E. Franks their Henry E. Millson Award for Invention for lyocell. In 1966–1968, D. L. Johnson of Eastman Kodak Inc. studied NMMO solutions. In the decade 1969 to 1979, American Enka tried unsuccessfully to commercialize the process. The operating name for the fibre inside the Enka organization was &quot;Newcell&quot;, and the development was carried through pilot plant scale before the work was stopped. The basic process of dissolving cellulose in NMMO was first described in a 1981 patent by Mcorsley for Akzona Incorporated (the holding company of Akzo). In the 1980s the patent was licensed by Akzo to Courtaulds and Lenzing. The fibre was developed by Courtaulds Fibres under the brand name &quot;Tencel&quot; in the 1980s. In 1982, a 100 kg/week pilot plant was built in Coventry, UK, and production was increased tenfold (to a ton/week) in 1984. In 1988, a 25 ton/week semi-commercial production line opened at the Grimsby, UK, pilot plant. The process was first commercialized at Courtaulds&#x27; rayon factories at Mobile, Alabama (1990), and at the Grimsby plant (1998). In January 1993, the Mobile Tencel plant reached full production levels of 20,000 tons per year, by which time Courtaulds had spent £100 million and 10 years on Tencel development. Tencel revenues for 1993 were estimated as likely to be £50 million. A second plant in Mobile was planned. By 2004, production had quadrupled to 80,000 tons.

Lenzing began a pilot plant in 1990, and commercial production in 1997, with 12 metric tonnes/year made in a plant in Heiligenkreuz im Lafnitztal, Austria. When an explosion hit the plant in 2003 it was producing 20,000 tonnes/year, and planning to double capacity by the end of the year. In 2004 Lenzing was producing 40,000 tons [sic, probably metric tonnes]. In 1998, Lenzing and Courtaulds reached a patent dispute settlement.

In 1998 Courtaulds was acquired by competitor Akzo Nobel, which combined the Tencel division with other fibre divisions under the Accordis banner, then sold them to private equity firm CVC Partners. In 2000, CVC sold the Tencel division to Lenzing AG, which combined it with their &quot;Lenzing Lyocell&quot; business, but maintained the brand name Tencel. It took over the plants in Mobile and Grimsby, and by 2015 were the largest lyocell producer at 130,000 tonnes/year.

== Process ==
Rayon is produced by dissolving cellulose, then converting this solution back to insoluble fibrous cellulose. Various processes have been developed for this regeneration. The most common methods for creating rayon are the cuprammonium method, the viscose method, and the lyocell process. The first two methods have been practiced for more than a century.

=== Cuprammonium methods ===

Cuprammonium rayon has properties similar to viscose; however, during its production, the cellulose is combined with copper and ammonia (Schweizer&#x27;s reagent). Due to the detrimental environmental effects of this production method, cuprammonium rayon is no longer being produced in the United States. The process has been described as obsolete, but cuprammonium rayon is still made by one company in Japan.

Tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate is also used as a solvent.

=== Viscose method ===

The viscose process builds on the reaction of cellulose with a strong base, followed by treatment of that solution with carbon disulfide to give a xanthate derivative. The xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step.

The viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose, whereas other routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as a starting material. The use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper, so it was traditionally used on a larger scale than the other methods. On the other hand, the original viscose process generates large amounts of contaminated wastewater. Newer technologies use less water and have improved the quality of the wastewater.

The raw material for viscose is primarily wood pulp (sometimes bamboo pulp), which is chemically converted into a soluble compound. It is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments, which are chemically solidified, resulting in fibers of nearly pure cellulose. Unless the chemicals are handled carefully, workers can be seriously harmed by the carbon disulfide used to manufacture most rayon.

To prepare viscose, pulp is treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide (typically 16–19% by mass) to form &quot;alkali cellulose&quot;, which has the approximate formula [C6H9O4−ONa]. This material is allowed to depolymerize to an extent. The rate of depolymerization (ripening or maturing) depends on temperature and is affected by the presence of various inorganic additives, such as metal oxides and hydroxides. Air also affects the ripening process, since oxygen causes depolymerization. The alkali cellulose is then treated with carbon disulfide to form sodium cellulose xanthate:

Rayon fiber is produced from the ripened solutions by treatment with a mineral acid, such as sulfuric acid. In this step, the xanthate groups are hydrolyzed to regenerate cellulose and carbon disulfide:

Aside from regenerated cellulose, acidification gives hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfur, and carbon disulfide. The thread made from the regenerated cellulose is washed to remove residual acid. The sulfur is then removed by the addition of sodium sulfide solution, and impurities are oxidized by bleaching with sodium hypochlorite solution or hydrogen peroxide solution.

Production begins with processed cellulose obtained from wood pulp and plant fibers. The cellulose content in the pulp should be around 87–97%.

The steps:

# Immersion: The cellulose is treated with caustic soda.
# Pressing. The treated cellulose is then pressed between rollers to remove excess liquid. 
# The pressed sheets are crumbled or shredded to produce what is known as &quot;white crumb&quot;.
# The &quot;white crumb&quot; is aged through exposure to oxygen. This is a depolymerization step and is avoided in the case of polynosics.
# The aged &quot;white crumb&quot; is mixed in vats with carbon disulfide to form the xanthate. This step produces &quot;orange-yellow crumb&quot;.
# The &quot;yellow crumb&quot; is dissolved in a caustic solution to form viscose. The viscose is set to stand for a period of time, allowing it to &quot;ripen&quot;. During this stage the molecular weight of the polymer changes.
# After ripening, the viscose is filtered, degassed, and then extruded through a spinneret into a bath of sulfuric acid, resulting in the formation of rayon filaments. The acid is used as a regenerating agent. It converts cellulose xanthate back to cellulose. The regeneration step is rapid, which does not allow proper orientation of cellulose molecules. So to delay the process of regeneration, zinc sulfate is used in the bath, which converts cellulose xanthate to zinc cellulose xanthate, thus providing time for proper orientation to take place before regeneration.
# &quot;Spinning.&quot; The spinning of viscose rayon fiber is done using a wet-spinning process. The filaments are allowed to pass through a coagulation bath after extrusion from the spinneret holes. The two-way mass transfer takes place.
# &quot;Drawing.&quot; The rayon filaments are stretched, in a procedure known as drawing, to straighten out the fibers.
# &quot;Washing.&quot; The fibers are then washed to remove any residual chemicals from them.
# &quot;Cutting.&quot; If filament fibers are desired, then the process ends here. The filaments are cut down when producing staple fibers.

===Lyocell method===

The lyocell process relies on dissolution of cellulose products in a solvent, N-methyl morpholine N-oxide (NMMO).

The process starts with cellulose and involves dry-jet wet spinning. It was developed at the now defunct American Enka Company and Courtaulds Fibres. Lenzing&#x27;s Tencel is an example of a lyocell fiber. Unlike the viscose process, the lycocell process does not use highly toxic carbon disulfide. &quot;Lyocell&quot; has become a genericized trademark, used to refer to the lyocell process for making cellulose fibers.

, the lyocell process is not widely used, because it is still more expensive than the viscose process.

== Properties ==


Rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as natural fibers, although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon. It can imitate the feel and texture of silk, wool, cotton, and linen. The fibers are easily dyed in a wide range of colors. Rayon fabrics are soft, smooth, cool, comfortable, and highly absorbent, but they do not always insulate body heat, making them ideal for use in hot and humid climates, although also making their &quot;hand&quot; (feel) cool and sometimes almost slimy to the touch.

The durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayons are low, especially when wet; also, rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber. However, HWM rayon (high-wet-modulus rayon) is much stronger and exhibits higher durability and appearance retention. Recommended care for regular viscose rayon is dry-cleaning only. HWM rayon can be machine-washed.

Regular rayon has lengthwise lines called striations and its cross-section is an indented circular shape. The cross-sections of HWM and cupra rayon are rounder. rayon yarns vary from 80 to 980 filaments per yarn and vary in size from 40 to 5000 denier. Staple fibers range from 1.5 to 15 denier and are mechanically or chemically crimped. Rayon fibers are naturally very bright, but the addition of delustering pigments cuts down on this natural brightness.

== Structural modification ==

The physical properties of rayon remained unchanged until the development of high-tenacity rayon in the 1940s. Further research and development led to high-wet-modulus rayon (HWM rayon) in the 1950s. Research in the UK was centred on the government-funded British Rayon Research Association.

&quot;High-tenacity rayon&quot; is another modified version of viscose that has almost twice the strength of HWM. This type of rayon is typically used for industrial purposes such as tire cord.

Industrial applications of rayon emerged around 1935. Substituting cotton fiber in tires and belts, industrial types of rayon developed a totally different set of properties, amongst which tensile strength and elastic modulus were paramount.

 is a genericized trademark of Lenzing AG, used for (viscose) rayon which is stretched as it is made, aligning the molecules along the fibers. Two forms are available: &quot;polynosics&quot; and &quot;high wet modulus&quot; (HWM). &quot;High-wet-modulus rayon&quot; is a modified version of viscose that is stronger when wet. It can be mercerized like cotton. HWM rayons are also known as &quot;polynosic&quot;. Polynosic fibers are dimensionally stable and do not shrink or get pulled out of shape when wet like many rayons. They are also wear-resistant and strong while maintaining a soft, silky feel. They are sometimes identified by the trade name Modal. Modal is used alone or with other fibers (often cotton or spandex) in clothing and household items like pajamas, underwear, bathrobes, towels, and bedsheets. Modal can be tumble-dried without damage. The fabric has been known to pill less than cotton due to fiber properties and lower surface friction. The trademarked Modal is made by spinning beech-tree cellulose and is considered a more eco-friendly alternative to cotton, as the production process uses on average 10–20 times less water.

== Producers and brand names ==

In 2018, viscose fiber production in the world was approximately 5.8 million tons, and China was the largest producer with about 65% of total global production. Trade names are used within the rayon industry to label the type of rayon in the product. Viscose rayon was first produced in Coventry, England in 1905 by Courtaulds.

&quot;Bemberg&quot; is a trade name for cuprammonium rayon developed by J. P. Bemberg. Bemberg performs much like viscose but has a smaller diameter and comes closest to silk in feel. Bemberg is now only produced in Japan. The fibers are finer than viscose rayon.

&quot;Modal&quot; and &quot;Tencel&quot; are widely used forms of rayon produced by Lenzing AG. Tencel, generic name &quot;lyocell&quot;, is made by a slightly different solvent recovery process, and is considered a different fiber by the US FTC. Tencel lyocell was first produced commercially by Courtaulds&#x27; Grimsby plant in England. The process, which dissolves cellulose without a chemical reaction, was developed by Courtaulds Research.

Birla Cellulose is also a volume manufacturer of rayon. They have plants located in India, Indonesia and China.

Accordis was a major manufacturer of cellulose-based fibers and yarns. Production facilities can be found throughout Europe, the U.S. and Brazil.

&quot;Visil rayon&quot; and HOPE FR are flame retardant forms of viscose that have silica embedded in the fiber during manufacturing.

North American Rayon Corporation of Tennessee produced viscose rayon until its closure in the year 2000.

Indonesia is one of the largest producers of rayon in the world, and Asia Pacific Rayon (APR) of the country has an annual production capacity of 0.24 million tons.

== Environmental impact ==
The biodegradability of various fibers in soil burial and sewage sludge was evaluated by Korean researchers. Rayon was found to be more biodegradable than cotton, and cotton more than acetate. The more water-repellent the rayon-based fabric, the more slowly it will decompose. Subsequent experiments have shown that wood-based fibres, like Lyocell, biodegrade much more readily than polyester. Silverfish—like the firebrat—can eat rayon, but damage was found to be minor, potentially due to the heavy, slick texture of the tested rayon. Another study states that &quot;artificial silk [...] [was] readily eaten&quot; by the grey silverfish.

A 2014 ocean survey found that rayon contributed to 56.9% of the total fibers found in deep ocean areas, the rest being polyester, polyamides, acetate and acrylic. A 2016 study found a discrepancy in the ability to identify natural fibers in a marine environment via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Later research of oceanic microfibers instead found cotton being the most frequent match (50% of all fibers), followed by other cellulosic fibers at 29.5% (e.g., rayon/viscose, linen, jute, kenaf, hemp, etc.). Further analysis of the specific contribution of rayon to ocean fibers was not performed due to the difficulty in distinguishing between natural and man-made cellulosic fibers using FTIR spectra.

For several years, there have been concerns about links between rayon manufacturers and deforestation. As a result of these concerns, FSC and PEFC came on the same platform with CanopyPlanet to focus on these issues. CanopyPlanet subsequently started publishing a yearly Hot Button report, which puts all the man-made cellulosics manufacturers globally on the same scoring platform. The scoring from the 2020 report scores all such manufacturers on a scale of 35, the highest scores having been achieved by Birla Cellulose (33) and Lenzing (30.5).

=== Carbon disulfide toxicity ===

Carbon disulfide is highly toxic. It is well documented to have seriously harmed the health of rayon workers in developed countries, and emissions may also harm the health of people living near rayon plants and their livestock. Rates of disability in modern factories (mainly in China, Indonesia, and India) are unknown. This has raised ethical concerns over viscose rayon production. , production facilities located in developing countries generally do not provide environmental or worker safety data.

Most global carbon disulfide emissions come from rayon production, as of 2008. , about 250 g of carbon disulfide is emitted per kilogram of rayon produced.

Control technologies have enabled improved collection of carbon disulfide and reuse of it, resulting in a lower emissions of carbon disulfide. These have not always been implemented in places where it was not legally required and profitable.

Carbon disulfide is volatile and is lost before the rayon gets to the consumer; the rayon itself is basically pure cellulose.

Studies from the 1930s show that 30% of American rayon workers experienced significant health impacts due to carbon disulfide exposure. Courtaulds worked hard to prevent this information being published in Britain.

During the Second World War, political prisoners in Nazi Germany were made to work in appalling conditions at the Phrix rayon factory in Krefeld. Nazis used forced labour to produce rayon across occupied Europe.

In the 1990s, viscose rayon producers faced lawsuits for negligent environmental pollution. Emissions abatement technologies had been consistently used. Carbon-bed recovery, for instance, which reduces emissions by about 90%, was used in Europe, but not in the US, by Courtaulds. Pollution control and worker safety started to become cost-limiting factors in production.

Japan has reduced carbon disulfide emissions per kilogram of viscose rayon produced (by about 16% per year), but in other rayon-producing countries, including China, emissions are uncontrolled. Rayon production is steady or decreasing except in China, where it is increasing, .

Rayon production has largely moved to the developing world, especially China, Indonesia and India. Rates of disability in these factories are unknown, , and concerns for worker safety continue.

== Controversy ==
Studies have found the production of rayon can be harmful to the health of factory workers. Workers in factories utilizing the viscose process may be exposed to high levels of carbon disulfide, which can cause coronary heart disease, retinal damage, behavioral changes, impaired motor function, and various fertility and hormonal effects.

== Related materials ==

Related materials are not regenerated cellulose, but esters of cellulose.

Nitrocellulose is a derivative of cellulose that is soluble in organic solvents. It is mainly used as an explosive or as a lacquer. Many early plastics, including celluloid, were made from nitrocellulose.

Cellulose acetate shares many traits with viscose rayon and was formerly considered the same textile. However, rayon resists heat, while acetate is prone to melting. Acetate must be laundered with care either by hand-washing or dry cleaning, and acetate garments disintegrate when heated in a tumble dryer. The two fabrics are now required to be listed distinctly on USA garment labels.

Cellophane is generally made by the viscose process, but dried into sheets instead of fibers.

<doc id="162025" wikidata="Q48264" url="?curid=162025" title="Gender identity">
<text>Gender identity is the personal sense of one&#x27;s own gender. Gender identity can correlate with a person&#x27;s assigned sex or can differ from it. In most individuals, the various biological determinants of sex are congruent and consistent with the individual&#x27;s gender identity. Gender expression typically reflects a person&#x27;s gender identity, but this is not always the case. While a person may express behaviors, attitudes, and appearances consistent with a particular gender role, such expression may not necessarily reflect their gender identity. The term &quot;gender identity&quot; was coined by psychiatry professor Robert J. Stoller in 1964 and popularized by psychologist John Money.

In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes associated with males and females, a gender binary to which most people adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. Some people do not identify with some, or all, of the aspects of gender associated with their biological sex; some of those people are transgender, non-binary, or genderqueer. Some societies have third gender categories.

The 2012 book &quot;Introduction to Behavioral Science in Medicine&quot; says that with exceptions, &quot;Gender identity develops surprisingly rapidly in the early childhood years, and in the majority of instances appears to become at least partially irreversible by the age of 3 or 4&quot;. The Endocrine Society has stated &quot;Considerable scientific evidence has emerged demonstrating a durable biological element underlying gender identity. Individuals may make choices due to other factors in their lives, but there do not seem to be external forces that genuinely cause individuals to change gender identity.&quot; Social constructivists argue that gender identity, or the way it is expressed, are socially constructed, determined by cultural and social influences. Constructivism of this type is not necessarily incompatible with the existence of an innate gender identity, since it may be the expression of that gender that varies by culture.

== Age of formation ==

There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children&#x27;s immature language acquisition requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence. John Money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years; Lawrence Kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3. It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3. At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys), although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender. After age three, it is extremely difficult to change gender identity.

Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and pre-schoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of five to seven years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this &quot;peak of rigidity&quot;, fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat. Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning gender role standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.

According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) comprehensive sexuality education should raise awareness of topics such as gender and gender identity.

==Factors influencing formation==

=== Nature versus nurture ===

Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which gender identity is determined by nurture (social environmental factors) versus biological factors (which may include non-social environmental factors) is at the core of the ongoing debate in psychology known as &quot;nature versus nurture&quot;. There is increasing evidence that the brain is affected by the organizational role of hormones in utero, circulating sex hormones and the expression of certain genes.

Social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child&#x27;s life. The social learning theory posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way, thus being shaped by the people surrounding them through trying to imitate and follow them. 

Large-scale twin studies suggest that the development of both transgender and cisgender gender identities is due to genetic factors, with a small potential influence of unique environmental factors.

==== Case of David Reimer and contrasting case ====

A well-known example in the nature-versus-nurture debate is the case of David Reimer, born in 1965, otherwise known as &quot;John/Joan&quot;. As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. John Money advised Reimer&#x27;s parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer underwent sex reassignment surgery at seventeen months and grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys. In the early 1970s, Money reported that Reimer&#x27;s sex reassignment to female was a success, influencing the academic consensus toward the nurture hypothesis, and for the following 30 years, it became standard medical practice to reassign intersex infants and male infants with micropenises to female.

John Money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity, though he used the term &quot;gender role&quot;. He disagreed with the previous school of thought that gender was determined solely by biology. He argued that infants are born a blank slate and a parent could be able to decide their babies&#x27; gender. In Money&#x27;s opinion, if the parent confidently raised their child as the opposite sex from earlier than age two, the child would believe that they were born that sex and act accordingly. Money believed that nurture could override nature.

After Reimer tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia. Reimer stopped seeing Money, and underwent surgery to remove his breasts and reconstruct his genitals. In 1997, sexologist Milton Diamond published a follow-up, revealing that Reimer had rejected his female reassignment, and arguing against the blank slate hypothesis and infant sex reassignment in general.

Diamond was a longtime opponent of Money&#x27;s theories. Diamond had contributed to research involving pregnant rats that showed hormones played a major role in the behavior of different sexes. The researchers in the lab would inject the pregnant rat with testosterone, which would then find its way to the baby&#x27;s bloodstream. The females that were born had genitalia that looked like male genitalia. The females in the litter also behaved like male rats and would even try to mount other female rats, proving that biology played a major role in animal behavior.

One criticism of the Reimer case is that Reimer lost his penis at the age of eight months and underwent sex reassignment surgery at seventeen months, which possibly meant that Reimer had already been influenced by his socialization as a boy. Bradley et al. (1998) report the contrasting case of a 26-year-old woman with XY chromosomes whose penis was lost and who underwent sex reassignment surgery between two and seven months of age (substantially earlier than Reimer), whose parents were also more committed to raising their child as a girl than Reimer&#x27;s, and who remained a woman into adulthood. She reported that she had been somewhat tomboyish during childhood, enjoying stereotypically masculine childhood toys and interests, although her childhood friends were girls. While she was bisexual, having had relationships with both men and women, she found women more sexually attractive and they featured more in her fantasies. Her job at the time of the study was a blue-collar occupation that was practiced almost exclusively by men. Griet Vandermassen argues that since these are the only two cases being documented in scientific literature, this makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions from them about the origins of gender identity, particularly given the two cases reached different conclusions. However, Vandermassen also argued that transgender people support the idea of gender identity as being biologically rooted, as they do not identify with their anatomical sex despite being raised and their behaviour reinforced according to their anatomical sex.

==== Other cases ====
One study by Reiner et al. looked at fourteen genetic males who had suffered cloacal exstrophy and were thus raised as girls. Six of them changed their gender identity to male, five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities (though two of them had declared they were male). All the subjects had moderate to marked interests and attitudes consistent with that of biological males. Another study, using data from a variety of cases from the 1970s to the early 2000s (including Reiner et al.), looked at males raised as females due to a variety of developmental disorders (penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy or penile ablation). It found that 78% of those males raised as females were living as females. A minority of those raised as female later switched to male. However, none of the males raised as male switched their gender identity. Those still living as females still showed marked masculinisation of gender role behaviour and those old enough reported sexual attraction to women. The study&#x27;s authors caution drawing any strong conclusions from it due to numerous methodological caveats which were a severe problem in studies of this nature. Rebelo et al. argue that the evidence in totality suggests that gender identity is neither determined entirely by childhood rearing nor entirely by biological factors.

===Biological factors===
Several prenatal biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity. It has been suggested that gender identity is controlled by prenatal sex steroids, but this is hard to test because there is no way to study gender identity in animals. According to biologist Michael J. Ryan, gender identity is exclusive to humans.

In a position statement, the Endocrine Society stated:

====Transgender and transsexuality====

Some studies have investigated whether there is a link between biological variables and transgender or transsexual identity. Several studies have shown that sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are shifted away from what is associated with their birth sex and towards what is associated with their preferred sex. The volume of the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of a stria terminalis or BSTc (a constituent of the basal ganglia of the brain which is affected by prenatal androgens) of transsexual women has been suggested to be similar to women&#x27;s and unlike men&#x27;s, but the relationship between BSTc volume and gender identity is still unclear. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women. Transsexuality has a genetic component.

Research suggests that the same hormones that promote the differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity. Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match the norm of their sex assigned at birth, and in acting and looking like their identified gender.

===Social and environmental factors===

In 1955, John Money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood. Money&#x27;s hypothesis has since been discredited, but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation. In the 1960s and 1970s, factors such as the absence of a father, a mother&#x27;s wish for a daughter, or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence, with a 2004 article noting that &quot;solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking.&quot; A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers. It has also been suggested that the attitudes of the child&#x27;s parents may affect the child&#x27;s gender identity, although evidence is minimal.

====Parental establishment of gender roles====
Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles. Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of the parental association (&quot;coding&quot;) of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine. However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy. Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity, with Kane stating that &quot;the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys&#x27; options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity.&quot;

Many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child&#x27;s sex through technology such as ultrasound. The child thus is born to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions. Once the child&#x27;s sex is determined, most children are raised to in accordance with it, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.

When considering the parents&#x27; social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class &quot;professional&quot; couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender can shape the child&#x27;s understanding of gender as well as the child&#x27;s development of gender.

A study conducted by Hillary Halpern demonstrated that parental gender behaviors, rather than beliefs, are better predictors of a child&#x27;s attitude on gender. A mother&#x27;s behavior was especially influential on a child&#x27;s assumptions of the child&#x27;s own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father&#x27;s behavior and his children&#x27;s knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. Fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.

==Intersex people==

Estimates of the number of people who are intersex range from 0.018% to 1.7%, depending on which conditions are counted as intersex. An intersex person is one possessing any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, or genitals that, according to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, &quot;do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies&quot;. An intersex variation may complicate initial sex assignment and that assignment may not be consistent with the child&#x27;s future gender identity. Reinforcing sex assignments through surgical and hormonal means may violate the individual&#x27;s rights.

A 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile ablation, found that 78% of the study subjects were living as female, as opposed to 22% who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex. The study concludes: &quot;The findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood, but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens.&quot;

A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria. Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third &#x27;X&#x27; sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an &quot;X&quot; or &quot;other&quot; option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. At birth, 52% of persons in the study were assigned female, and 41% were assigned male.

A study by Reiner &amp; Gearhart provides some insight into what can happen when genetically male children with cloacal exstrophy are sexually assigned female and raised as girls, according to an &#x27;optimal gender policy&#x27; developed by John Money: in a sample of 14 children, follow-up between the ages of 5 and 12 showed that 8 of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests, providing support for the argument that genetic variables affect gender identity and behavior independent of socialization.

==Gender variance and non-conformance==
Gender identity can lead to societal security issues among individuals that do not fit on a binary scale. As of 2022, only 23 states plus Washington D.C. currently have state laws that explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Moreover, only &quot;53% of [the] LGBTQ population live in states prohibiting housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity&quot;, while &quot;17% of [the] LGBTQ population lives in states explicitly interpreting existing prohibition on sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and/or gender identity&quot;.
In some cases, a person&#x27;s gender identity is inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics (genitals and secondary sex characteristics), resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms. These gender expressions may be described as gender variant, transgender, or genderqueer (or non-binary) (there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity), and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria (traditionally called gender identity disorder or GID). Transgender individuals are often greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before, during, and after their transition.

In recent decades it has become possible to provide sex reassignment surgery. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see transsexual for some of the possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity. Within recent years modern society has made strides towards the acknowledgement and destigmatization of those who identify as non-binary or a gender variant, with sex reassignment surgery expected to grow by an annual rate of about 11% from the years 2022 to 2030. Although sex reassignment surgery is expected to become more popular, the surgery is still not destigmatized in a lot of countries, including the United States. Such stigmatization has been shown to have adverse health effects on LGBTQ+ individuals, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History and definitions==

===Definitions===
The terms &quot;gender identity&quot; and &quot;core gender identity&quot; were first used with their current meaning—one&#x27;s personal experience of one&#x27;s own gender—sometime in the 1960s. To this day they are usually used in that sense, though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the sexual orientation and sexual identity categories &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;lesbian&quot; and &quot;bisexual&quot;. Gender expression is distinct from gender identity in that gender expression is how one chooses to outwardly express their gender through one&#x27;s &quot;name, pronouns, clothing, hair style, behavior, voice or body features.&quot; It is thus distinct from gender identity in that it is the external expression of gender but may not necessarily portray a person&#x27;s gender identity and may vary &quot;according to racial/ethnic background, socio-economic status and place of residence.&quot;

===Early medical literature===
In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called &quot;inverts&quot;, and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a &quot;dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework&quot;. During the mid-1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their &quot;correct&quot; gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.

===Freud and Jung&#x27;s views===
In 1905, Sigmund Freud presented his theory of psychosexual development in &quot;Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality&quot;, giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an Oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child&#x27;s power to appease sexual impulses. In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s and &#x27;60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of homosexuality (which was viewed as a mental disorder at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the UCLA Medical Center for the study of intersex and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst Robert Stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book &quot;Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity&quot; (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term &quot;gender identity&quot; to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1963. Behavioral psychologist John Money was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at Johns Hopkins Medical School&#x27;s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book &quot;Man and Woman, Boy and Girl&quot; (1972) became widely used as a college textbook, although many of Money&#x27;s ideas have since been challenged.

===Butler&#x27;s views===
In the late 1980s, gender studies scholar Judith Butler began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, they published &quot;Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity&quot;, introducing the concept of gender performativity. Butler argues that the traditional view of gender is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which they unite the concepts of performativity and gender.

==Present views==
===Medical field===
Transgender people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure on infants, and recommends that the procedure be only conducted when medically necessary. Today, gender-affirming surgery is performed on people who choose to transition so that their external sexual organs will match their gender identity.

In the United States, the Affordable Care Act provided that health insurance exchanges would have the ability to collect demographic information on gender identity and sexual identity through optional questions, to help policymakers better recognize the needs of the LGBTQ community. In 2020, however, the Trump administration finalized a rule that &quot;would remove nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people when it comes to health care and health insurance&quot; in the Affordable Care Act and extends to &quot;regulations pertaining to access to health insurance.&quot; This rule &quot;is one of the many rules and regulations put forward by the Trump administration that defines &quot;sex discrimination&quot; as only applying when someone faces discrimination for being male or female, and does not protect people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.&quot;

===Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder===

Gender dysphoria (previously called &quot;gender identity disorder&quot; or GID in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; or DSM) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant dysphoria (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex: &quot;In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one&#x27;s external genitalia and the brain coding of one&#x27;s gender as masculine or feminine.&quot; The DSM (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder can be made, and the disorder is further subdivided into specific diagnoses based on age, for example gender identity disorder in children (for children who experience gender dysphoria).

The concept of gender identity appeared in the third edition of the DSM, DSM-III (1980), in the form of two psychiatric diagnoses of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, DSM-III-R, added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder. In 2013, the DSM-5 renamed the diagnosis &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; and revised its definition.

The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a mental disorder, speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial, although the vast majority of today&#x27;s mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications. In recent years, however, there has been a &quot;growing chorus of voices contesting the pathologization of transgender lives and the dominance of medical-scientific narratives about trans experience.&quot; As such, in 2019, the World Health Organization removed gender dysphoria from the mental illness chapter and moved it instead to the sexual health chapter, changing the term &quot;Gender Dysphoria&quot; to &quot;Gender Incongruence,&quot; thereby removing gender dysphoria as a pathological mental illness.

===International human rights law===
The Yogyakarta Principles, a document on the application of international human rights law, provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person&#x27;s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person&#x27;s sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that &quot;Each person&#x27;s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity.&quot; Principle 18 states that &quot;Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person&#x27;s sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed.&quot; Relating to this principle, the &quot;Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles&quot; observed that &quot;Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected gender expression, have been treated as a form of mental illness. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques – including electroshock therapy – as a &#x27;cure&#x27;.&quot; The &quot;Yogyakarta Principles in Action&quot; says &quot;it is important to note that while &#x27;sexual orientation&#x27; has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, &#x27;gender identity&#x27; or &#x27;gender identity disorder&#x27; often remains in consideration.&quot; These Principles influenced the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2015, gender identity was part of the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; in which marriage was no longer legally restricted to be only between man and woman.

==Measurement==
No objective measurement or imaging of the human body exists for gender identity, as it is part of one&#x27;s subjective experience. Numerous clinical measurements for assessing gender identity exist, including questionnaire-based, interview-based and task-based assessments. These have varying effect sizes among a number of specific sub-populations. Gender identity measures have been applied in clinical assessment studies of people with gender dysphoria or intersex conditions.

==Terminology==
Before the , the term &quot;gender&quot; was used exclusively as a grammatical category. The terms &quot;male&quot; and &quot;man&quot;, or &quot;female&quot; and &quot;woman&quot;, were used more or less interchangeably when referring to people of one sex or the other. As the term &quot;gender&quot; took on new meaning following the work of John Money, Robert Stoller, and others, a distinction began to be drawn between the terms &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot;. As a result of the new understanding of gender, academic usage of the term &quot;sex&quot; began to be more restricted to biological aspects, and associated with the choices &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;, while the term &quot;gender&quot; was associated initially with &quot;man&quot; or &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;girl&quot; or &quot;woman&quot;.

===Binary gender identities===

While academic usage of terms &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; began to diverge at the same time, and become more restricted to concepts related to gender, this distinction was not universal (and still is not) even in academic usage, and even less so in more informal writing or in speech, which often conflate the two.

===Non-binary gender identities===

Some people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a binary in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms &quot;non-binary&quot; or &quot;genderqueer&quot;. Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman.&quot; These are often referred to as &quot;third genders&quot;.

====Fa&#x27;afafine====

In Samoan culture, or Faʻa Samoa, fa&#x27;afafine are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua&#x27;ali&#x27;i (&quot;see references&quot;), fa&#x27;afafine in Samoa at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa&#x27;afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against. Fa&#x27;afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks. The Samoan Prime Minister is patron of the Samoa Fa&#x27;afafine Association. Translated literally, fa&#x27;afafine means &quot;in the manner of a woman.&quot;

====Hijras====
&quot;Hijras&quot; are officially recognized as third gender in the Indian subcontinent, being considered neither completely male nor female. Hijras have a recorded history in the Indian subcontinent since antiquity, as suggested by the Kama Sutra. Many hijras live in well-defined and organised all-hijra communities, led by a guru. These communities have consisted over generations of those who are in abject poverty or who have been rejected by or fled their family of origin. Many work as sex workers for survival.

The word &quot;hijra&quot; is a Hindustani word. It has traditionally been translated into English as &quot;eunuch&quot; or &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;, where &quot;the irregularity of the male genitalia is central to the definition&quot;. However, in general hijras are born male, only a few having been born with intersex variations. Some hijras undergo an initiation rite into the hijra community called nirvaan, which involves the removal of the penis, scrotum, and testicles.

====Khanith====

The khanith form an accepted third gender in Oman. The khanith are male homosexual prostitutes whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms are female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at weddings or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similar to men in their society, khaniths can marry women, proving their masculinity by consummating the marriage. Should a divorce or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.

====Two-spirit identities====
Many indigenous North American Nations had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond cisgender man and woman, are now often collectively termed &quot;two-spirit&quot; or &quot;two-spirited&quot;. There are parts of the community that take &quot;two-spirit&quot; as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.

<doc id="162026" wikidata="Q5434533" url="?curid=162026" title="Far East Air Force (United States)">
<text>The Far East Air Force (FEAF) was the military aviation organization of the United States Army in the Philippines just prior to and at the beginning of World War II. Formed on 16 November 1941, FEAF was the predecessor of the Fifth Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces and the United States Air Force.

Initially the Far East Air Force also included aircraft and personnel of the Philippine Army Air Corps. Outnumbered operationally more than three-to-one by aircraft of the Japanese Navy and Army, FEAF was largely destroyed during the Philippines Campaign of 1941–42. When 14 surviving B-17 Flying Fortresses and 143 personnel of the heavy bombardment force were withdrawn from Mindanao to Darwin, Australia in the third week of December 1941, Headquarters FEAF followed it within days. The B-17s were the only combat aircraft of the FEAF to escape capture or destruction.

The FEAF, with only 16 Curtiss P-40s and 4 Seversky P-35 fighters remaining of its original combat force, was broken up as an air organization and moved by units into Bataan 24–25 December. 49 of the original 165 pursuit pilots of FEAF&#x27;s 24th Pursuit Group were also evacuated during the campaign, but of non-flying personnel, only one of 27 officers and 16 wounded enlisted men escaped the Philippines. Nearly all ground and flying personnel were employed as infantry at some point during their time on Bataan, where most surrendered on 9 April 1942.

The surviving personnel and a small number of aircraft received from the United States were re-organized in Australia in January 1942, and on 5 February 1942 redesignated as &quot;5 Air Force&quot;. With most of its aircraft based in Java, the FEAF was nearly destroyed a second time trying to stem the tide of Japanese advances southward.

== 1912–1941 ==

===Philippine Department Air Force===
The &quot;Philippine Department Air Force&quot; was formed on 6 May 1941 as the War Department hastily reversed course and attempted to upgrade its air defenses in the Philippines. The general officer requested by Philippine Department head Maj. Gen. George Grunert arrived on 4 May in the person of Brig. Gen. Henry B. Clagett , who had just completed a three-week air defense course taught at Mitchel Field, New York, to familiarize him with the concepts of integrating Signal Corps radars, radio communications, and interceptor forces. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall had also given Clagett a top-secret mission to go to China in mid-May for a month of observation and assessment of Japanese tactics.

The PDAF&#x27;s only major unit, the 4th Composite Group, consisted of five squadrons based at two grass fields: Clark and Nichols. A third airfield, Nielson Field, lacked facilities and was used primarily as an administrative strip for nearby Fort McKinley. An isolated sod auxiliary strip at Iba on the west coast was used for gunnery training. PDAF&#x27;s materiel was centrally located in the Philippine Air Depot at Nichols Field, easily targeted from the air and highly inflammable. The only existing antiaircraft defenses were a single battery of four 3-inch gun M1903 guns and a searchlight platoon at Fort Wint at the entrance to Subic Bay, which would only be marginally reinforced in September.

In May 1941 its aircraft situation was only marginally better than a year before: only 22 P-26 fighters, 12 &quot;utterly obsolete, ancient, vulnerable as pumpkins&quot; B-10s, the 56 P-35As diverted from the sale to Sweden, 18 Douglas B-18 Bolos still in crates after disassembly and shipment from the Hawaiian Department in March, nine North American A-27s impressed from a foreign sales consignment, several Douglas C-39 transports, and a small number of varied observation planes. Its only modern aircraft were 31 Curtiss P-40B fighters earmarked for the 20th Pursuit Squadron. Although delivered in mid-May, they were not operational for lack of antifreeze engine coolant. PDAF Headquarters was located at Fort Santiago near Manila; the majority of the planes were at either Clark or Nichols. Except for one small commercial firm in Manila, no oxygen-producing plants existed in the Philippines, severely limiting the service ceiling of all aircraft, but particularly the fighters.

Clagett immediately undertook an administrative &quot;shakeup&quot; of the existing organization. He marginalized Col. Harrison H. C. Richards, the Philippine Department Air Officer, relieved Col. Lawrence S. Churchill of command of the 4th Composite Group (but retained him in the position of base commander of Nichols Field), created new channels of command, and because of a lack of qualified staff officers, drew senior (but administratively untrained) officers from the squadrons to fill his staff. The last move further aggravated a problem created when experienced pilots of both the 17th and 20th squadrons had been transferred to augment the understrength 4th Group. A lack of cohesion and confidence in command resulted that continued into the war. Richards and Churchill both responded with &quot;obstructionist tactics&quot; that exacerbated the already poor command situation.
In July, the P-40s finally became operational, but Nichols Field was then closed to replace its east-west runway with one made of concrete, and to regrade the north-south runway, both measures taken to correct drainage deficiencies that made the field virtually inoperable in the wet season May through October. On the morning of 2 July (ironically, delayed five days by a typhoon), all three fighter squadrons transferred the FEAF&#x27;s 39 P-35s and 20 P-26s to Clark and Iba, where the 17th Pursuit Squadron moved for gunnery training. Construction of two new fields intended to support heavy bomber operations, at Rosales on the Lingayen Plain and Del Carmen near Clark Field, proceeded slowly.

On 26 July 1941, Gen. Douglas MacArthur was recalled to active duty from retirement and the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) was created by the War Department to reorganize the defenses of the Philippines against a Japanese invasion. The PDAF was renamed &quot;Air Force, USAFFE&quot; on 4 August 1941, and incorporated into its ranks the newly inducted Philippine Army Air Corps on 15 August 1941. Its headquarters moved to Nielson Field, and although the move had been made to increase the urgency of expanding air capabilities, precious time had been lost that was never re-gained.

==Creation of the FEAF==

===Pre-war upgrades and expansion===
In July 1941, Chief of the Army Air Forces, Major General Henry H. Arnold, allocated 340 heavy bombers (not yet manufactured) and 260 modern fighter planes for future reinforcement of the Far East Air Force. Work at Nichols continued slowly in the second half of the year, but the 17th PS was forced to return there to accommodate the planned arrival of the heavy bombers, and the accident rate, already high, increased.

By 1 October 50 P-40Es had also been shipped to the islands, and a new organization, the 24th Pursuit Group, stood up to control the three pursuit squadrons. Between 10 February and 20 November 1941 FEAF received 197 additional pilots, 141 of whom were or became pursuit pilots. All except 28 of the fighter pilots were fresh from flight schools and required further individual training, which cut into needed unit tactical training. Arrangements were made with the oxygen-producing plant in Manila, which supplied the U.S. Navy&#x27;s shipyard at Cavite, to buy any surplus for pursuit units, but output was so small that only the squadron at Nichols (which reopened on 17 October) could be supplied, and on a limited basis.
The 14th Bombardment Squadron, assigned the best crews and nine B-17s of the 11th Bomb Group in Hawaii, was detached from that group to pioneer an air ferry route to the Philippines, arriving 12 September in the middle of a typhoon. Two squadrons of the 19th Bombardment Group followed in October–November. The 14th and 28th Bomb Squadrons were attached to the 19th BG and a total of 35 B-17 Flying Fortresses constituted the FEAF&#x27;s heavy bombardment force.

Arnold wrote on 1 December 1941, &quot;We must get every B-17 to the Philippines as soon as possible.&quot; The War Department projected 165 heavy bombers and 240 fighters to be based in the Philippines by March 1942. B-17s of the 7th Bombardment Group based in Utah staged in California and its 88th Reconnaissance Squadron was in-transit by air at the time the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.

The personnel of two squadrons of the 35th Pursuit Group (the 21st and 34th, their pilot rosters at half strength), and three of the 27th Bombardment Group (Light), moved by a convoy of two transports escorted by the cruiser , but without their airplanes, and disembarked at Manila on 20 November 1941. The pursuit squadrons were attached to the 24th Pursuit Group and acquired P-35s from the other squadrons for training purposes. A shipment of 24 crated P-40Es arrived in Manila by freighter on 25 November, the first of 50 intended for the 35th Pursuit Group, and were trucked to the Philippine Air Depot at Nichols Field for assembly.

From a force of five squadrons (one bombardment, one observation and three pursuit) and 110 operational aircraft in May 1941, the Philippine Department now had thirteen squadrons and 195 combat aircraft. However, only ten squadrons had airplanes (four bombardment, five pursuit, and one observation), and although most of its new equipment was considered first-line by the Army Air Forces, none of it was first-rate by the standards of air forces already engaged in aerial combat. Further, the overwhelming majority of its fighter pilots were sorely lacking in meaningful flying experience.

=== FEAF organized ===

MacArthur held the position that Japan would not attempt an invasion of the Philippines before April 1942. Clagett (described by one historian of the campaign as lacking &quot;the necessary elasticity of mind and body for realistic preparation for total war&quot;) had twice been hospitalized during mid-1941 and was not meeting the demands of even this scenario. At the beginning of September Arnold met with Marshall to identify a replacement for Clagett who would infuse the necessary urgency into the Philippine buildup.

Maj. Gen. Lewis H. Brereton arrived in the Philippines to command FEAF on 4 November 1941. Bomber, fighter, and service commands for the FEAF were organized when it stood up on 16 November 1941; Clagett was placed in command of the provisional 5th Interceptor Command and Churchill made commander of Far East Air Service Command. When a war warning from Marshall was received in the Philippines on 28 November (Philippine time), FEAF began dispatching two B-17s daily on reconnaissance flights of the sea lanes north of Luzon, but with orders not to overfly Japanese territory on Formosa. Units worked to complete protective and dispersal measures, while interceptors were armed and placed on alert status.

The arrival of National Guard units at the end of September provided the first ground defenses for Clark Field. Two battalions of light tanks were positioned at Fort Stotsenburg in late November to protect Clark against seizure by Japanese airborne troops, while the 200th Coast Artillery Regiment (AA) provided limited antiaircraft artillery defense with .50-caliber machine guns and a dozen 3-inch guns.

The &quot;Pensacola convoy&quot; of seven transport vessels gathered at Honolulu and sailed for Manila on 29 November, transporting the 52 Douglas A-24 dive bombers of the 27th BG, 18 P-40s intended for the 49th Pursuit Group, 48 pilots of the 35th PG, 39 recent flight school graduates on &quot;casual&quot; status, and the ground echelons of five squadrons, all escorted by the USS &quot;Pensacola&quot;. The remainder of the 35th Group (the remaining pilots, two pursuit squadrons, and group headquarters) sailed aboard the USAT &quot;President Garfield&quot; for Honolulu on 6 December to join another convoy.

===Aircraft inventory on 8 December 1941===
Each of the five pursuit squadrons had a TO&amp;E strength of 25 aircraft including spares, but because of accidents and other factors, none had that total. The decision was made by FEAF to use only 18 in tactical commission, regardless of the number in their inventory. 20 P-40Es had been delivered to the 21st PS on 4 and 6 December but many had not yet had their engines slow-timed and none had more than two hours of flying time. All of the P-35As had been over-used for gunnery training because of a shortage of .50-caliber ammunition and needed engine changes (none were operationally available and the Far East Air Depot had neither facilities nor personnel for large-scale engine maintenance), while their guns were wholly unreliable from poor maintenance. The ammunition shortage also resulted in practically none of those equipping the P-40s being test-fired, much less used in gunnery practice, and many failed in combat.

FEAF had only 54 fully operational and capable P-40s and 34 B-17s on 8 December. Against these 88 fighters and bombers, the Japanese committed 288 first-line combat aircraft in fully trained units of the Navy&#x27;s 11th Kōkūkantai and Army&#x27;s 5th Hikōshidan to support its Luzon operations: 108 land-based naval bombers, 54 army bombers, 90 Mitsubishi A6M Zero carrier fighters, and 36 Nakajima Ki-27 (Army Type 97) &quot;Nate&quot; army fighters.

The numbers below in italicized brackets indicate the number of FEAF aircraft in the inventory actually flyable on 8 December. If no figure is listed, the number of usable aircraft is unknown.
*Boeing B-17C/D: 35 &quot;(32)&quot; 
*Curtiss P-40B/E: 91 &quot;(89)&quot; 
*North American A-27: 8 &quot;(1)&quot; 
*Seversky P-35A: &quot;(26)&quot; 
*Douglas B-18A: 18 &quot;(15, all as trainer-transports, with 2 at Del Monte)&quot;
*Martin B-10B: 3 &quot;(1 PAAC)&quot;
*Boeing P-26A: 12 &quot;(12 PAAC)&quot;
*Curtiss O-52: 11
*Other: 46
There were 60 additional aircraft in the Philippine Army Air Corps, including one Keystone ZB-3A bomber. 42 were Stearman 76DC trainers of varying serviceability and utility.

===FEAF airfields===
Within of Manila, the Army had six airfields (Clark, Nichols, Nielson, Iba, Del Carmen, and Rosales), two of which were auxiliary strips nearing completion. Another four auxiliary strips were begun in November: O&#x27;Donnell and San Fernando near Clark, San Marcelino northwest of Subic Bay, and Ternate west of Cavite (Ternate and San Fernando were never finished). No strips were planned on Bataan, despite its prominence in strategic war planning. In August and October 1941, the War Department allocated US$9,273,000 (approximately $150 million in 2015 dollars) to construct and improve airfields, most of which was spent constructing a concrete runway at Nichols Field (the only hard-surfaced runway in the Philippines). Additional graded strips were also added or extended to the grass runways at Clark Field, with the rest of the allocated funds used to build the auxiliary fields. The auxiliary strips were dirt-surfaced and without maintenance, servicing, communications, or control facilities. The dust clouds generated by takeoffs at all strips except Nichols seriously hampered flight operations, with numerous mishaps that destroyed many aircraft, killed pilots, and reduced the assigned strength of already tiny combat missions. The use of expedients to cut down the dust, including a molasses mixture deposited by a tank truck, was unsuccessful.

Del Monte Field was operated by FEAF on the island of Mindanao. In November 1941, with the B-17s of the 7th Bomb Group expected to arrive in December, Clark Field was still the only base that could support heavy bombers but its all-grass parking areas and taxi strips could not withstand heavy operations when wet, making dispersal nearly impossible. Informed that three more groups were projected to arrive in January and February, MacArthur and his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Richard K. Sutherland, favored new bomber bases in the Visayas but recognized that selected sites at Cebu and Tacloban would not support bomber operations without significant and expensive construction of runways. As a compromise, on 24 November 1941 the newly arrived 5th Air Base Group was hurried south to northern Mindanao by inter-island steamer to build a second bomber base for the 7th BG. Begun 27 November on the site of an emergency landing strip surveyed in September 1941, the new base was situated next to the Sayre National Highway northwest of Tankulan in Bukidnon Province.

Established in a &quot;natural meadow&quot; on a high plateau southeast of Cagayan City, and flanked on both sides by low hills, the site was in a pineapple plantation owned by the Del Monte Corporation. It needed only the cutting of grass to create a hard, all-weather sod runway. Del Monte No. 1, the bomber runway, was ready for limited operations by 5 December. A much smaller pre-war liaison strip, situated across the highway to the southwest on a small golf course, was designated Del Monte No. 3, and a parallel runway for fighter operations later cut northeast of the bomber runway was called Del Monte No. 2.

After Japanese intruder and weather reconnaissance flights were detected on several successive nights, sixteen B-17s of the 14th and 93d Bombardment Squadrons were dispersed from Clark to Del Monte No. 1 on the night of 5–6 December, circling until dawn (5 December in the United States) before landing. They intended to remain only 72 hours because neither maintenance facilities nor barracks had yet been built, and only a single radio was operating. Two understrength ordnance companies from Clark had preceded them to Del Monte on 3 December and constructed their own camp in Tankulan, but the remainder of their personnel and all the materiel required, particularly aviation gas, did not depart Luzon until 10 December. For several months after hostilities began, work continued on another Del Monte strip in the barrio of Dalirig, east of the bomber strip, and at crude but well-camouflaged dispersal fields located to further inland at Malaybalay, Valencia and Maramag in Bukidnon Province.

Lubao Field on Luzon, in the barrio of Prado in Pampanga Province, became the location for a new airfield after Clark and Nichols were neutralized by the Japanese. Begun in sugarcane fields along Highway 7 near the entrance to Bataan by 400 Filipino laborers under the supervision of Philippine Army engineers, the fighter strip was still not completed when most of the 21st Pursuit Squadron commanded by 1st Lt. William E. Dyess arrived from Manila on 15 December. Working around the clock, the combined force completed construction of the runway, constructed revetments and graded taxiways in preparation for basing a dozen P-40s and five P-35s there, flown by a mixed assortment of experienced pilots from all five pursuit squadrons. Lubao Airfield began operations on 26 December and was superbly camouflaged. The 21st PS flew reconnaissance and other missions from Lubao until 2 January 1942, when the field was evacuated. On 29 December, three pursuits (two P-40s and a P-35) were salvaged at the last minute at Clark Field in the face of advancing Japanese units by a volunteer group of mechanics and flown to Lubao, where they were evacuated with the others.

Five fighter strips were opened on Bataan to support defensive operations during the withdrawal and subsequent siege:
*Orani Field. A camouflaged dirt strip on the upper end of Bataan also opened operations on 26 December. The 34th PS received its transfer orders on Christmas Day and conducted twice daily reconnaissance flights using five P-40s. The field was camouflaged using rice straw and movable haystacks, and was not attacked before it too was abandoned, on 4 January. 
*Pilar Field. Aircraft withdrawing from both Lubao and Orani were flown to an airfield near Pilar which had been graded in rice fields by Filipino hand labor. Revetments had been built and camouflaged in one day on 26 December by the 17th PS. Operations at Pilar began on 1 January using the final three new P-40Es of the 25 November shipment, which were assembled in the last week of December at the Philippine Air Depot, relocated to Quezon City. The last mission from Pilar was flown 8 January, after which its nine P-40 aircraft displaced to Del Monte Field, Mindanao (only six arrived).
*Bataan Field. The primary fighter base after the withdrawal into Bataan was originally graded in early 1941 as a dirt strip running uphill from a coastal road. Dubbed &quot;Richards&#x27; Folly&quot; after the Department Air Officer who had ordered its construction, it was located on the Manila Bay side of Bataan about three miles north of Cabcaben, a village on the southern tip of the peninsula. The runway was widened and lengthened to after 24 December by the 803rd Aviation Engineers in anticipation of future operations. The first aircraft, two P-35s and an A-27 displaced from Lubao, arrived on 2 January, and on 4 January the nine P-40s at Orani were sent down. Combat operations began on 8 January, the aircraft concealed in hidden revetments until they could be launched between raids made by Japanese dive bombers. The P-35s were flown to Mindanao on 11 January after the A-27 was lost in a landing accident. Maintenance and operation of the field was assigned to the 16th Bombardment Squadron (27th Bomb Group), which had no aircraft, and damage to the runways from raids was repaired by Company C, 803rd Aviation Engineers.
*Cabcaben Field. At the end of January 1942 a strip in length was hastily graded by civilian contractors south of Bataan Field and made operational as a dispersal field on 6 February. The 21st PS was recalled from infantry duties on 12 February to operate and maintain both it and Bataan airfields. 
*Mariveles Field. The existing dirt liaison field at the southernmost point on Bataan was abandoned on 7 January, but at the end of the month a road adjacent to the field was extended and widened to provide a new fighter strip in width and long. Its orientation to the overlooking heights was such that once a pilot was committed to landing, he had no choice but to continue, and was subject to severe tail-winds. The 20th Pursuit Squadron was also recalled on 12 February to complete defensive position preparations, camouflage revetments, and maintain the field, which became operational on 23 February.

=== Warning systems ===
The &quot;Warning Service&quot; of the Philippine Department was directed by Lt. Col. Alexander H. Campbell, who had originally transferred to the Philippines in October 1939 to command a battalion of the 60th Coast Artillery (AA). Functioning as an office of the Intelligence Section (G-2) of the department headquarters, the Warning Service operated an interim &quot;Information and Operation Center&quot; at Nielson Field that included an electrically lighted map to plot sightings that indicated origins of reports with twinkling lights. In lieu of working detection equipment and trained personnel, the Warning Service maintained a primitive system of 509 observation posts manned by 860 civilian watchers, unschooled in aircraft identification, who would report airplane movements by five radio, two telegraph, and ten telephone networks manned by members of all three U.S. military services, the Philippine Army and constabulary, the Philippine postal system, and civilian companies in the provinces. Interpreters were required for the many dialects used by the observers. Message processing encountered significant delays between the time of observation and time of report.

On 4 May 1941, the Warning Service was shifted to the new PDAF as the &quot;Air Warning Service&quot;. A newly trained 194-man Signal Corps air warning company arrived by transport on 1 August to operate two SCR-271C fixed-location air tracking radars planned for deployment on Luzon, each with a range of . Campbell immediately prepared a study for Clagett recommending 24-hour operations and modern aircraft detection equipment, specifically two mobile SCR-270B units and nine SCR-271s, allotting eight units to Luzon and three to Mindanao, and expanding the force to a 915-man battalion. He also suggested that radars be established at some future time on the islands of Lubang, Samar, Palawan, Jolo, Basilan, Tablas, Panay, and Negros.

His specific recommendation was in line with the one SCR-270/seven SCR-271 recommendation of the Air Defense Board just received by the War Department, and was endorsed by MacArthur on 8 September with a recommendation for funds. MacArthur was notified by wire the next day that an SCR-270 and two SCR-271s were already in transit to the Philippines by ship for use by the air warning company, with three more SCR-270s to follow in October. However, by 15 November, when the AWS was integrated into the new 5th Interceptor Command, plans for the fixed-location radar sites were only five percent complete and no date to begin construction had been set. The 557th Air Warning Battalion was designated to provide the expanded early warning defense, and was at its port of embarkation at San Francisco on 6 December.

The AWS received seven SCR-270 mobile units but only two were operating on 8 December: one in full operation at Iba, and a Marine Corps unit training at Nusugbu in Batangas Province. The latter was assigned to the Air Warning Detachment of the 1st Separate Marine Battalion in late November to provide protection to the Navy base. The Iba unit had been operational since 18 October and was fully functioning. On 29 November, in response to the war warning sent to all overseas commands by Marshall, the detachment went on continuous watch in three shifts.

Three Army detachments with mobile units and the Marine detachment were ordered into the field on 3 December with instructions to be in operation by 10 December. Of the Army detachments, at the onset of hostilities one had just reached position at Burgos, Ilocos Norte, in northwest Luzon; another was at Tagaytay, Cavite, with a damaged set; and the third was newly established at Paracale, Camarines Norte, in southeastern Luzon, where it had just completed calibration tests. The two fixed-location SCR-271s were in storage.
USAFFE also received 11 sets of SCR-268 antiaircraft radars, a searchlight-control radar that could also be used for gun laying of AA weapons. After the FEAF was forced to withdraw into Bataan to continue operations, its primitive fields were subject to frequent attack from Luzon-based aircraft of the Japanese Army. An SCR-268 of the 200th Coast Artillery was placed in operation on the hillside above Cabcaben Airfield. Used in conjunction with the sole surviving SCR-270B unit, hidden in the jungle a mile from Bataan Field, it served as an early warning system and was linked to headquarters of the 5th Interceptor Command at Mariveles. Takeoffs and landings by the Bataan Field Flying Detachment required towing of P-40s off the runways to and from hidden revetments, and were vulnerable to strafing. The ad hoc system facilitated coordination of field operations, and while imperfect, no aircraft were lost during takeoffs or landings.

== Combat operations ==

===Philippines campaign===

====Surprise attack====

Japanese air operations against FEAF airfields on Luzon were scheduled to take off from their Formosan bases beginning at 1:30 am on 8 December, with attacks to commence 21 minutes after dawn (and approximately four hours after offensive operations began in Hawaii), at 6:30 am. However, reconnaissance flights dispatched to check weather conditions between Formosa and Luzon neither returned nor reported as launch time approached, and a thick fog over southern Formosa set back the timetable by 90 minutes. The commanders of Japanese units were disturbed when monitoring of American radio traffic indicated that the weather flights had been detected despite the darkness and attempts were made by Iba-based P-40s to intercept. Although all the interceptions failed, Iba Field was then substituted as a target in place of Nichols (where it was assumed that two squadrons of B-17s had dispersed) to deal with the new interceptor threat. Further radio monitoring revealed to the Japanese that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet had been alerted at 4:00 am of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and they expected attacks on their own bases by B-17s (bombing through the fog undercast) at any time after 7:00 am. The air defense weaknesses of the FEAF were mirrored by those of the Japanese, who had prepared only for offensive operations, but no attack came before a final revised plan was issued at 7:50 am, ordering the main attack force of Japanese land-based aircraft to launch at 9:15 am and attack at 12:30 pm

Brereton attempted in person to obtain authorization for attacks on Formosa soon after word of events in Hawaii reached Manila, but was twice prevented from speaking with MacArthur by Sutherland. The authorization was refused, apparently a misinterpretation of standing orders not to make &quot;the first overt act.&quot; The P-40 squadrons at Clark, Iba, and Nichols moved to alert takeoff positions at 6:00 am as news of war spread among the units. A large force of aircraft was detected flying south towards Luzon, prompting the takeoff at 8:30 am of 15 of the 19 B-17s at Clark with orders to patrol within communications range of its control tower, while the 24th Pursuit Group launched its three P-40 squadrons and the P-35 squadron at Del Carmen to patrol central Luzon for intruders. At 8:50 am and 10:00 am, telephone attempts to obtain authorization from USAFFE headquarters for a B-17 attack was also rebuffed by Sutherland. However MacArthur himself called Brereton at 10:15 am and released the bomber force to employ at his discretion. Brereton immediately ordered two bombers to conduct reconnaissance flights and recalled the rest to prepare for a late afternoon bombing mission. The B-17s and the fighters, which were low on fuel, all landed by 11:00 am to refuel and prepare for afternoon operations.

Japanese naval bombers and fighters took off according to their revised schedule and approached Luzon in two well-separated forces, both of which were detected by the Iba radar detachment just before 11:30 am. Despite an hour&#x27;s warning, only the P-40 squadron at Iba took off, and it ran low on fuel in futile response to confusing instructions from the 24th PG that resulted from changing analyses of Japanese intents. The Iba P-40s were in their landing pattern when the Japanese struck. The aircraft at Clark and Iba were caught on the ground when the attack began at 12:35 pm. One hundred and seven two-engined bombers divided into two equal forces bombed the airfields first, after which 90 Zero fighters conducted strafing attacks until 1:25 pm (the fighters strafing Iba concluded at 1:05 pm, after which they flew to Clark and resumed attacks). Nearly the entire B-17 force at Clark, one-third of the U.S. fighters and its only operational radar unit were destroyed. The Japanese lost only seven fighters and a single bomber to combat.

Follow-up attacks on Nichols and Del Carmen fields, which were not targeted on 8 December, followed two days later, completing the destruction of AAF offensive and defensive opposition to the Japanese in the Pacific. A decision was made late that day to save the surviving fighters for reconnaissance use by avoiding direct combat. Fourteen surviving B-17s, after just two days of small and unsuccessful attacks on Japanese amphibious forces, were transferred to Batchelor Field, Australia, for maintenance between 17 and 20 December, bringing Clagett with them. They resumed bombing missions from Australia against Japanese shipping in the Philippines, landing at Del Monte, beginning 22 December and continuing through 25 December. On 1 January 1942, the remaining ten operational bombers forward located to Java.

Brereton evacuated FEAF headquarters on 24 December to Darwin, Northern Territory by way of the Netherlands East Indies, leaving the new head of the 5th Interceptor Command, Col. Harold H. George (promoted to brigadier general 25 January 1942) in command of units in the Philippines. Reduced to a single squadron-sized composite force, his pursuit fighters were carefully husbanded for reconnaissance duties and forbidden to engage in combat until forced to evacuate to fields hurriedly built on the Bataan peninsula, to which USAFFE and FEAF were ordered to withdraw on 24 December, the last aircraft arriving on 2 January 1942.

====Defense of Bataan====

Combat and accidents reduced but did not eliminate the P-40 complement, and a group of pursuit pilots, called the &quot;Bataan Field Flying Detachment,&quot; continued to fly missions until the last day of the campaign, employing mainly 30-pound fragmentation bombs and machine gun fire as ordnance. Four of the six P-40s sent to Del Monte on 8 January were recalled to Bataan two weeks later, but only three arrived, leaving the detachment still with just seven P-40Es and two P-40Bs. The small detachment, gradually attrited, had a few notable successes:
*26 January 1942, morning missions strafed boats attempting to reinforce Japanese landings behind the USAFFE lines on the west coast of Bataan, and shot down three Mitsubishi Ki-30 (Army Type 97) &quot;Ann&quot; dive bombers trying to support the landings. That night the detachment conducted a successful attack on Japanese aircraft at Nielson Field, then shot up a truck convoy on the north shore of Manila Bay.
*1–2 February 1942, a night attack by four P-40s flying two sorties each bombed and strafed a 13-barge convoy attempting to delivery 700 reinforcements to the Japanese beachheads, destroying nine and killing approximately half the troops aboard, confirmed later by Japanese records.
*2 March 1942, an all-day attack on shipping in Subic Bay and supply dumps on Grande Island resulted in 12 sorties. Claims included total destruction of an ammunition ship, but Japanese records could not be located to corroborate more than a subchaser sunk. However apparently extensive damage to at least four large ships was made. Four of the five remaining P-40s were used in the attacks, with one shot down and its pilot killed, and two others destroyed in landing accidents at Mariveles.

A single flyable P-40E remained at Bataan Field, although by 5 March mechanics had repaired the damaged P-40B at Cabcaben using P-40E parts, facetiously calling the composite a &quot;P-40 something&quot;. Occasional individual reconnaissance flights were made in the following month by the two craft. Brig. Gen. George was evacuated by PT boat on 11 March, ending the effective usefulness of the detachment, whose pilots were severely debilitated by starvation and disease. Churchill eventually succeeded to nominal command 12 days before the surrender, but was unable to evacuate and became a prisoner of war.

Accidents put all three P-40s based on Mindanao out of commission by 9 February, leaving just two P-35s that had escaped from Bataan. Transfer of a propeller put a P-40 back in commission two days later, and shipment to Cebu by submarine of parts taken from wrecks on Bataan put another back in operation by mid-March, when a fire destroyed one of them on the ground. Three new P-40Es, still in crates, were shipped from Brisbane, Australia, by blockade runner on 22 February but ran aground on 9 March on a reef between Bohol and Leyte. Carefully hidden and moved by barge at night, the crates reached Mindanao on 26 March, where a makeshift air depot had been established in a coconut grove at Buenavista Airfield using mechanics of the 19th Bomb Group and the 440th Ordnance Company. By 2 April, all three P-40s were assembled and flight-tested, making the Mindanao P-40 force twice as large as that on Bataan.

The two P-40s on Bataan both flew out on 8 April, the P-40E to Iloilo City on Panay, where it landed wheels up, and the P-40B to Cebu. The two P-35s on Mindanao flew back to Bataan Field on 4 April and evacuated three pursuit pilots in their baggage compartments. A Navy Grumman J2F Duck that the 20th Pursuit Squadron raised from Mariveles Bay and placed in service again on 24 March evacuated five officers. Bataan surrendered the next morning. The P-40B reached Mindanao but crashed on 14 April trying to land at Dalirig in a heavy rain.

Although FEAF no longer existed as a command, its P-40s and service troops on Mindanao supported the final offensive air operations of the campaign. Early on 11 April ten B-25 Mitchell medium bombers of the 3rd Bomb Group and three B-17Es of the 40th Reconnaissance Squadron took off from Batchelor Field and arrived that evening at Del Monte. The small task force, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ralph Royce, had originally planned to break the Japanese blockade of Luzon long enough for supplies to be delivered by sea to Bataan. However its surrender obviated that mission and instead the aircraft flew up for two days of attacks against the landing forces at Cebu City and Davao on 12 and 13 April.

The three new P-40Es and the sole remaining P-35 operated out of Maramag Field until 3 May. The P-35 was transferred to the Philippine Army Air Corps and two surviving P-40Es were ultimately captured intact by the Japanese army on 12 May.

Against the loss from all causes of 108 P-40s and 25 P-35s (25 in air-to-air combat), FEAF pilots were credited by USAF Historical Study No. 85, &quot;USAF Credits for the Destruction of Enemy Aircraft, World War II&quot;, with 35 aerial victories between 8 December 1941 and 12 April 1942. 33 pursuit pilots were killed in the campaign and 83 surrendered to become prisoners of war, with 49 of those dying in captivity. 95% of enlisted men became POWs, and 61% of those died before they could be repatriated.

===Netherlands East Indies campaign===

====Rebuilding the FEAF====
On 29 December 1941, Brereton and his staff arrived in Darwin and reestablished FEAF headquarters. His only combat forces were 14 B-17s of the 19th Bomb Group sent south from Del Monte. By 1 January 1942, ten of the bombers had been shifted northwest to Singosari Airfield on Java, from which the 19th BG flew its next combat mission on 4 January against Japanese shipping off Davao City, using Samarinda Airfield on Borneo as a staging base. On 11 January the first aircraft of the 7th Bomb Group arrived via India and from that date on FEAF conducted its operations solely for the defense of the Netherlands East Indies. FEAF became a part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) created to unify forces in the defense of the NEI. On 18 January, FEAF headquarters moved to Bandoeng.
The &quot;Pensacola&quot; convoy for the Philippines was diverted on 13 December to Brisbane, where it disembarked its Air Corps personnel and the crated A-24 dive bombers on 23 December, then continued to Darwin with field artillery reinforcements on 29 December. The pursuit and partially trained pilots began training as assembly of the crated aircraft went forward at Archerfield and Amberley airdromes. 21 pilots of the 27th Bomb Group and 17 from the 24th Pursuit Group were flown to Australia in the last two weeks of December to ferry back the assembled aircraft, but no engine coolant had been sent with the fighters and the guns of the dive bombers were missing key electrical and mounting components, hampering not only reinforcement of FEAF but limiting flight training of the new pilots. The &quot;President Garfield&quot;, 500 miles at sea en route to Honolulu, reversed course after receiving word that war had begun in Hawaii and returned to San Francisco. The USAT &quot;President Polk&quot;, a cargo liner impressed into service as an Army transport, embarked 55 P-40s, an equal number of pilots and ground crews gathered from four groups based in California (including 27 pilots off the &quot;President Garfield&quot;), and sailed without escort on 18 December, reaching Brisbane on 13 January 1942, where assembly of the P-40s began by the aircraft mechanics of the ground crews. The &quot;President Polk&quot; embarked the ground echelons of two squadrons of the 7th Bomb Group (based at Jogjakarta) and continued to Java, escorted by the heavy cruiser USS &quot;Houston&quot;, arriving in Surabaya on 28 January.

By mid-January, Japanese advances southward cut the anticipated aircraft ferry routes to the Philippines and reinforcement was no longer feasible. Instead, using aircraft as their assembly was completed and assigning personnel at hand, provisional fighter squadrons were organized in Brisbane to assist the Royal Netherlands Indies Air Force (ML-KNIL) in defending the NEI. The 17th Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) was established on 14 January, and 13 of its 17 pilots had previously been with the 24th PG. With 17 P-40s delivered by the &quot;Pensacola&quot; convoy (assembly of the 18th could not be completed because of a lack of parts), it flew across northern Australia from Brisbane to Darwin, then to Java via Penfoie Airdrome at Koepang and Den Pasar Field on Bali between 16 and 25 January. Only 12 Warhawks arrived at the designated FEAF fighter base at Ngoro Field, the others lost to accidents, combat, and pilot illness. The 20th Pursuit Squadron (Provisional), incorporating pilots of the 35th PG, took off from Darwin in 25 P-40s on 2 February, but only 17 reached Java, the remainder shot down over Bali or damaged on the ground by air raids. Likewise, 25 P-40s of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) departed Brisbane, but because of accidents involving novice pilots, only 18 reached Darwin on 8 February. Just nine eventually reinforced Ngoro; an entire flight of eight was lost when it exhausted its fuel after its LB-30 navigation guide aircraft became lost in a storm trying to find Koepang. Survivors of both the 3rd and 20th provisional squadrons were integrated into the 17th PS. The 33rd Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) was en route to Java at Darwin when it was nearly annihilated by a Japanese air raid on 19 February. Of 83 P-40s assembled and flown from Brisbane, only 37 arrived at Ngoro Field, and by 15 February less than 20 could be mustered for operations.

The 91st Bombardment Squadron was re-manned in Brisbane with pilots from the 27th BG, and dispatched eleven A-24s to Java on 11 February, but the Japanese threat to Timor prevented the other two squadrons of the 27th from following. Inadequate facilities at its new airfield near Malang delayed maintenance of the dive bombers and prevented their operational use until 19 February. 32 assembled P-40s were collected at Maylands Airfield near Perth, Western Australia, towed to Fremantle on the night of 19–20 February, and loaded on the flight deck of the seaplane tender USS &quot;Langley&quot;. The &quot;Langley&quot; sailed at noon 23 February in convoy for Burma but was immediately diverted for Java, as was the freighter MS &quot;Sea Witch&quot; soon after, carrying 27 unassembled and crated P-40s destined for the 51st Pursuit Group in China. All of the aircraft aboard &quot;Langley&quot; were lost when it was sunk on 27 February. 31 of the 33 pilots of the 13th and 33rd Pursuit Squadrons (Provisional) perished in the attack. The &quot;Sea Witch&quot; reached Tjilatjap harbor the next day but destroyed its cargo to keep the P-40s from being captured by the Japanese.

====Operations on Java====

On 3 February the Japanese opened a series of air attacks on ABDA bases on Java, and the 19th BG was again caught on the ground, losing five of its B-17s in a raid on Singosari, four of them on the ground. On 20 February, just back from a mission to bomb the invasion force at Bali, seven B-17s of the 19th BG were caught on the ground at Pasirian Field in southeastern Java by Zero strafers while re-arming and five more were destroyed. Although 38 of the more capable B-17E Flying Fortresses and a dozen LB-30 Liberators incrementally reinforced both heavy bombardment groups of the FEAF, losses were severe and the slow rate of reinforcement was unable to keep pace. Despite dispersal and elaborate camouflage, a lack of antiaircraft artillery and poor warning/communication systems resulted in the loss of 65 FEAF aircraft on the ground alone.

Evacuations of personnel from Java and diversion of resources to India and Australia began 20 February. By 24 February only ten heavy bombers, four A-24 dive bombers, and 13 P-40 fighters remained flyable against Japanese forces. ABDA Command was officially dissolved the next day. The ground echelons of both heavy bomb groups began evacuation by sea on 25 February, while the bombers, carrying up to 20 passengers each, made daily six-hour flights to Broome, Western Australia, an intermediate evacuation point for all aircraft fleeing Java. Malang/Singosari closed on 28 February and Jogjakarta the next night, following the final bomber sorties. 260 men, including the remnants of the 17th Pursuit Squadron, were evacuated by five B-17s and three LB-30s. 35 passengers crammed the final LB-30 that took off at 12:30 am of 2 March. On 3 March, nine Japanese fighters attacked Broome, destroying two of the evacuated B-17s.

Of 61 heavy bombers based on Java, only 23 escaped: 17 B-17Es, three LB-30s, and three of the original B-17Ds of the 19th BG. Only six had been lost in aerial combat, but at least 20 were destroyed on the ground by Japanese attacks. Every fighter (39) and dive bomber (11) that arrived on Java was destroyed. Against these losses, the provisional pursuit squadrons were credited with the destruction of 45 Japanese aircraft in aerial combat. Heavy bombers had flown over sixty missions and at least 300 bomber sorties, but 40% of the bombers turned back or otherwise failed to find their targets. Brereton&#x27;s evacuation to India on 23 February 1942 effectively ended existence of the Far East Air Force, which had been re-designated &quot;5 Air Force&quot; on 5 February. Its headquarters was not re-manned until 18 September 1942 in Australia, when it was designated Fifth Air Force.

Fifth Air Force along with Thirteenth Air Force in the Central Pacific and Seventh Air Force in Hawaii was subsequently assigned to a higher echelon on 3 August 1944, the newly created United States Far East Air Forces also with the acronym FEAF. This FEAF was subordinate to the U.S. Army Forces Far East and served as the headquarters of Allied Air Forces Southwest Pacific Area.

The August 1941 strength of &quot;Air Force USSAFE&quot; was 2,049 enlisted troops under the command of 254 officers. Final FEAF peacetime strength is disputed. One source stated that, as of 30 November, its strength was 5,609: 669 officers and 4,940 enlisted troops. Another put the 7 December strength as 8,100. The Philippine Army Air Corps constituted another 1,500 members, with units at Maniquis Field (Cabanatuan), Zablan Field (Manila), and an auxiliary strip at Batangas, all on Luzon; and a detachment at Lahug on Cebu.

The Australian Infantry Forces provided through Richard Graves, an enthusiastic bushwalker, skier and pioneer of white water canoeing, he foresaw how knowledge of bushcraft could save lives during the Second World War. To achieve this end, initiated and led the Australian Jungle Rescue Detachment, assigned to the U.S. Far East Air Force. This detachment of 60 specially selected A.I.F. soldiers successfully effected more than 300 rescue missions, most of which were in enemy-held territory, without failure of a mission or loss of a man.

<doc id="162031" wikidata="Q5471375" url="?curid=162031" title="Fort Hughes">
<text>Fort Hughes was built by the Philippine Department of the U.S. Army on Caballo Island in the Philippines in the early 1900s. The fort, which part of the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays, was named for Major General Robert Patterson Hughes, a veteran of the American Civil War, Spanish–American War, and the Philippine–American War.

==History==
===Spanish–American War===
A Spanish battery of three naval guns from the Spanish navy cruiser &quot;Velasco&quot; was on the eastern end of the island in 1898, but was not engaged in the Battle of Manila Bay.

===Construction===
The initial construction on Fort Hughes was largely complete by 1914 except the mortar battery, completed in 1919. The initial gun batteries were:

Circa 1940 an antiaircraft battery of four guns on mobile mounts was added on the eastern end of the island, known as Battery Idaho. During 1941 Battery Williams was built, with three mobile guns on concrete &quot;Panama mounts&quot;. At some time after the commencement of hostilities in December 1941, one of these guns was detached as Battery Hooker.

Battery Gillespie was named for Major General George Lewis Gillespie Jr., Chief of Engineers 1901–1903. Battery Woodruff was named for Brigadier General Carle Augustus Woodruff, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient.
Battery Craighill was named for Brigadier General William Price Craighill, Chief of Engineers 1895–1897. Battery Leach was named for Colonel Smith Stallard Leach, an engineer officer. Battery Fuger was named for Lt. Col. Frederick Füger, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient. Battery Williams was named for 1st. Lt. George R. Williams, a Philippine Scouts officer killed at Abucay, Bataan in January 1942. Battery Idaho was named for the state of Idaho; the anti-aircraft batteries had US place names corresponding to which battery was manning them, in this case Battery I of the 59th Coast Artillery.

===World War II===
Fort Hughes was occupied by Japanese forces after their conquest of the Philippines. The fort was surrendered along with Corregidor and all other US and Filipino forces in the islands on 6 May 1942. The fort&#x27;s garrison executed destruction procedures on their guns prior to their surrender and the Japanese occupation. The Japanese were able to salvage the 3-inch guns of Battery Fuger and redeploy them at the Malinta Tunnel on Corregidor. Also, Battery Idaho&#x27;s four AA guns were redeployed to Clark Field.

American forces retook the fort from the Japanese during the liberation of the Philippines in 1945, beginning on 27 March 1945. The 2nd Battalion, 151st Infantry Regiment and other elements of the 38th Infantry Division amphibiously assaulted the island, following a brief but intense air and naval bombardment. Additional fire support came from the 163rd Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm howitzers) on Corregidor. The Japanese had prepared positions around the batteries and were able to shelter in the tunnels. Initial assaults were unsuccessful; the terrain was such that tanks could not bring their guns to bear on the Japanese positions. On 31 March an attempt was made to burn out the defenders by pouring diesel fuel down the only vent shaft accessible to the Americans. However, this did not work, as the diesel fuel could not be delivered up the sides of the battery fast enough. The commander of the 113th Engineer Battalion devised a solution using two diesel-filled pontoon cubes from the naval forces and a pump and flex hose from the air forces. On 5 April over of diesel fuel were pumped down the vent shaft and ignited using white phosphorus mortar rounds. This was repeated twice more on 6 and 7 April, followed by two demolition charges. The next few days were occupied with probing infantry attacks and attempts to persuade the surviving Japanese to surrender. On 13 April the last defender was killed and the fort was reclaimed.

==Present==
Both 14-inch guns and carriages and the 12-inch mortars remain in place. Battery Leach was destroyed in the recapture operation, but one 6-inch gun barrel remains. One Japanese 120 mm gun is also on the island. The island was turned over to Filipino forces in 1946, and as of 2012 was a Philippine Navy ammunition depot.

<doc id="162033" wikidata="Q5471168" url="?curid=162033" title="Fort Frank">
<text>Fort Frank (Carabao Island, the Philippines) was one of the defense forts at the entrance to Manila Bay established by the United States. The entire island was designated as Fort Frank, in honor of Brigadier General Royal T. Frank, as part of the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays built by the Philippine Department of the US Army in the early 1900s.

==Geography==
Carabao Island is located near the southern end of the entrance to Manila Bay about off the coast of Maragondon in the province of Cavite. The long, narrow island is surrounded by sheer cliffs over . The whole island and fort has an area of with the highest elevation at .

==History==

===Construction===
The establishment of the islands of Manila Bay as military reservations was requested by the US Army and enacted by Executive Order of President Theodore Roosevelt on 11 April 1902.

All but two of the fort&#x27;s batteries were completed in 1913. These included Batteries Greer and Crofton, each with one gun M1910 on a disappearing carriage. Battery Koehler had eight mortars, and Battery Hoyle had two seacoast guns on pedestal mounts. Circa 1940 Battery Hoyle was disarmed (one gun went to defend the &quot;stern&quot; of Fort Drum), and Battery Frank (or Frank North) was added, with four Panama mounts for mobile guns. In 1941 the antiaircraft Battery Ermita was added, with four AA guns on mobile mounts. Three field guns (possibly the gun M1917 also used by a Philippine Scouts regiment) for beach defense were also on the island.

Battery Greer was named for Col. John E. Greer, an Ordnance Corps officer. Battery Crofton was named for Captain William Crofton, an infantry officer. Battery Koehler was named for 1st Lt. Edgar F. Koehler, killed in the Philippine–American War. Battery Hoyle was named for Brigadier General Eli D. Hoyle, a Spanish–American War veteran who was an administrator in World War I.

Battery Ermita was probably named for the district in Manila. Battery Frank North was possibly named for Major Frank North, commander of the Pawnee Scouts.

===World War II===
The fort&#x27;s design included little protection against air and high-angle artillery attack except camouflage. Also, most of its heavy ammunition was armor-piercing, intended for use against battleships, rather than the high explosive type that would be more useful against enemy troops and artillery.

Fort Frank was heavily engaged in the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. On 31 January 1942 the fort&#x27;s mortar battery bombarded mainland positions in the Pico de Loro Hills that the Japanese were emplacing artillery in. The 75 mm guns were also able to engage mainland targets. The Japanese began bombarding Fort Drum and Fort Frank on 6 February 1942. Fort Frank was vulnerable in another way: its normal water supply was from a dam&#x27;s reservoir on the Japanese-held mainland. On 16 February the Japanese discovered this and removed part of the pipeline near the dam. Although the fort also had a distillation plant to provide fresh water, this consumed fuel that was also needed for the gun batteries&#x27; generators that powered the ammunition hoists. The fort&#x27;s commander ordered the distillation plant started, but also directed a 15-man team to attempt to restore the pipeline on the 19th. They successfully engaged a Japanese patrol but could not get to the pipeline. Eventually another party repaired the pipeline on 9 March. On 20 March 1942, thirty-four soldiers were killed by Japanese artillery when a round ricocheted into a tunnel at Battery Crofton.

Fort Frank was surrendered, along with all other US forces in the Philippines, on 6 May 1942, after destruction procedures were executed on its guns to prevent their use by the enemy.

During their occupation the Japanese were reportedly able to repair the gun of Battery Crofton and add three guns. In April 1945, during the American liberation of the Philippines, Fort Frank was heavily bombarded with bombs and napalm (among other ordnance) in preparation for recapture. On 16 April 1945 the 1st Battalion, 151st Infantry Regiment and Co. C, 113th Engineer Battalion landed on Fort Frank to find that the Japanese had successfully evacuated the island.

<doc id="162034" wikidata="Q5472361" url="?curid=162034" title="Fort Wint">
<text>Fort Wint was part of the harbor defenses of Manila and Subic Bays built by the Philippine Department of the United States Army between 1907 and 1920 in response to recommendations of the Taft Board prior to the non-fortification clause of the Washington Naval Treaty. Fort Wint was located on Grande Island at the entrance of Subic Bay, approximately 35 miles (56 km) north of Manila Bay. The fort was named for Brigadier General Theodore J. Wint. As specified in the National Defense Act of 1935, this was one of the locations where coastal artillery training was conducted. A battery of the 60th Coast Artillery (AA) was stationed here.

==Armament==
Fort Wint was armed with fourteen Taft-Endicott period coast artillery pieces mounted in five batteries. Battery Warwick contained the fort&#x27;s most powerful weaponry, two M1895 disappearing guns on Buffington-Crozier carriages. Batteries Hall and Woodruff each mounted two M1905 guns, also on disappearing carriages. Batteries Flake and Jewell were armed with M1903 guns on pedestal mounts.
As with other forts of the same period, the weaponry of Fort Wint was obsolete at the outbreak of hostilities with Japan in 1941.

==World War II==
In July 1941 minefields were laid at the entrance to Subic Bay. These included an Army controlled minefield operated from Fort Wint as well as naval mines, with the controlled Army mines in the ship channel, and naval mines to the sides of the channel. In December 1941 the bay entrance was ordered completely closed by Navy mines.

In the first week of January 1942, as Allied forces withdrew to the Bataan peninsula, Fort Wint was ordered abandoned and its crews reassigned to other American positions in Manila Bay. This was reportedly due to a mistake by the commander of the Northern Luzon Force. Consequently, the fort played no part in the subsequent siege of the island forts. Fort Wint was recaptured by U.S. forces in March 1945. The fort suffered substantial damage during the campaign to retake the Philippines .

==Post-war==

Grande Island and the remains of Fort Wint were incorporated into the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay. The two disappearing guns of Battery Warwick were dismantled by the United States Navy in the 1960s and shipped to Fort Casey in Washington state for renovation and display. The four guns of Batteries Flake and Jewell were removed and divided between Forts Flagler and Casey in Washington state where they remain on display. The guns of Battery Hall remain in place (pictures right). Grand Island was operated for many decades after WW II by Subic Bay US Navy Special Services as an on base resort for US Military and Civilians stationed throughout the Philippines. It was accessible via a small landing craft type boat shuttle service at the pier adjacent to the Alava Carrier Pier in front of the HQ building at Naval Station Subic Bay. 

During Operation New Life in 1975, thousands of South Vietnamese refugees were sheltered and processed on Grande Island after the fall of South Vietnam to North Vietnam on April 30. After the six-month rescue mission, Grande Island was rehabilitated and was restored to its Special Services resort configuration until 1991. At that time, the lease on US military bases expired, and the US bases were closed about the same time they were damaged by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Grande Island was restored as a resort after repairs following damage from the Mount Pinatubo eruption. It was restored by the civilian Philippine Subic Bay Free Port Zone Authority following the closure of the Subic Naval Base in 1992.

<doc id="162036" wikidata="Q639594" url="?curid=162036" title="List of American military installations">
<text>This is a list of military installations owned or used by the United States Armed Forces both in the United States and around the world. This list details only current or recently closed facilities; some defunct facilities are found at :Category:Former military installations of the United States.

A military installation is the basic administrative unit into which the U.S. Department of Defense groups its infrastructure, and is statutorily defined as any “base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction … [or] operational control of the Secretary of a military department or the Secretary of Defense.” An installation or group of installations may, in turn, serve as a base, which DOD defines as “a locality from which operations are projected or supported.”

The U.S. military maintains hundreds of installations, both inside the United States and overseas (with at least 128 military bases located outside of its national territory as of July 2024). According to the U.S. Army, Camp Humphreys in South Korea is the largest overseas base in terms of area. Most of foreign military installations are located in NATO countries, Middle East countries, South Korea, Australia, Japan.

U.S. officials have been accused of collaborating with oppressive regimes and anti-democratic governments to secure their military bases, from Central America to the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The Democracy Index classifies many of the forty-five current non-democratic U.S. base hosts as fully &quot;authoritarian governments&quot;. Military bases in non-democratic states were often rationalized during the Cold War by the U.S. as a necessary if undesirable condition in defending against the communist threat posed by the Soviet Union. Few of these bases have been abandoned since the end of the Cold War.

Several rounds of closures and mergers have occurred since the end of World War II, a procedure most recently known as Base Realignment and Closure. Anti-racist agitation in the early 2020s led to calls for changing bases to remove the names of Confederate figures who fought against the Union during the American Civil War. The Naming Commission was created by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, and renaming began in December 2022.

There were approximately 1,500–2,000 U.S. forces in Syria, spread across 12 different facilities, being used as training bases for Kurdish rebels. These soldiers withdrew from Syria to western Iraq in October 2019. Meanwhile, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the Pentagon was planning to &quot;leave 150 Special Operations forces at a base called al-Tanf&quot;, where the United States is training Free Syrian Army rebels. In addition, 200 U.S. soldiers would remain in eastern Syria near the oil fields, to prevent the Islamic State, Syrian government and Russian forces from advancing in the region.

According to the Head of the Syrian Arab Republic delegation to Astana talks the U.S. presence in Syria is &quot;illegal&quot; and &quot;without the consent of (the) government&quot;.

<text>The 24th Field Artillery Regiment (Philippine Scouts) (24th FA (PS)) was a Philippine Scouts unit, part of the US Army&#x27;s Philippine Division, formed in 1922 and active until April 1942. Antecedent units dated back to 1899.

== History ==
The 24th Field Artillery Regiment (Philippine Scouts) was constituted as a Regular Army unit on 22 December 1920, part of the Philippine Department. It was organized at Fort Stotsenburg on 15 May 1921 from the 1st Philippine Field Artillery Regiment (Provisional) (Mountain) and the 11th and 12th Infantry Battalions (Philippine Scouts) with the Philippine Division. Initially equipped with the 2.95-inch Mountain Gun, it converted to the truck-drawn 75 mm M1917 guns on 2 September 1931. During 1924 and 1925 it helped build a bridge over the Pinatubo River, and in the 1920s and 1930s also participated in the construction of an artillery trail from Fort Stotsenburg to the South China Sea via the Zambales Pass. 

The 1st Philippine Artillery Regiment had been provisionally formed, in 1917, at Fort Stotsenburg, from the 11th and 12th Philippine Scout Battalions, by the United States 2nd Field Artillery Regiment (Mountain). The 11th and 12th Philippine Scout Battalions (12th PS) had been formed in the Philippines in 1901. They were primarily composed of men from various provisional infantry companies, of Philippine Scouts, formed in 1899. Both battalions were involved in combat at Samar, Mindanao, and Jolo.

By July 1941 the regiment, with two battalions of the now World War I-vintage 75 mm guns, along with the one battalion-23rd Field Artillery, formed the entire artillery support of the Philippine Division. On the last day of the month it had a strength of 843 – 904 Philippine Scouts enlisted men and 39 officers, five of whom were Philippine Scouts. During the Battle of the Philippines against the Japanese, the 24th FA participated in the withdrawal, on Luzon, to the Bataan Peninsula and the Battle of Bataan. In the Bataan defensive line set up in January 1942, the regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion provided direct artillery support to the 57th Infantry (Philippine Scouts), holding positions on the coastal road and the beach on Manila Bay on the right flank of the position. Two batteries of the battalion were emplaced near Abucay while the remaining battery was on the main defensive line. The regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, southeast of Abucay, provided additional artillery support to II Philippine Corps and the 41st Division. On the night of 11 January the regiment&#x27;s guns replied to a Japanese artillery barrage that preceded an attack on the 57th Infantry&#x27;s main line of resistance. The 24th surrendered in April 1942.

The regiment was awarded the Philippines Islands Campaign Streamer. It was officially disbanded on 25 March 1952.

Members of the 24th Field Artillery Regiment included Juan Reyes Fabia, Lieutenant General Edward H. Brooks, and Elias Coloma.

<text>Oberhavel is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northern part of Brandenburg, Germany. Its neighbouring districts are (clockwise from the north): Mecklenburgische Seenplatte (district) in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the districts of Uckermark and Barnim, the &quot;Bundesland&quot; of Berlin, and the districts of Havelland and Ostprignitz-Ruppin.

==Geography==
The district is located on the upper course of the Havel river from its source to the outskirts of Berlin. The north is characterised by many lakes including the Großer Stechlinsee, which is well known thanks to a novel by Theodor Fontane called &quot;Der Stechlin&quot;.

==History==
The district was created on 6 December 1993 through the merging of the old Gransee and Oranienburg districts.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the eagle as the symbol of Brandenburg in the upper part. In the lower half are two flying swans on green background representing nature with many lakes. The coat of arms was unofficially used by the precursor district of Oranienburg before the merger, though not then officially granted. It was granted to the district of Oberhavel on 18 May 1994.

==Towns and municipalities==

== Demography ==


==Sport==
The district is home to three rugby union clubs, the RU Hohen Neuendorf, Veltener RC and Stahl Hennigsdorf Rugby. The latter was the most successful rugby club in East Germany, winning 27 national championships from 1952 to 1990.
