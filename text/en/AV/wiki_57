<text>Sari Nusseibeh () (born in 1949) is a Palestinian professor of philosophy and former president of the Al-Quds University in Jerusalem. Until December 2002, he was the representative of the Palestinian National Authority in that city. In 2008, in an open online poll, Nusseibeh was voted the 24th most influential intellectual in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by &quot;Prospect Magazine&quot; (UK) and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; (United States).

==Family background==
The Nusseibeh boast of a 1,300 year presence in Jerusalem, being descended from Ubayda ibn as-Samit, the brother of Nusaybah bint Ka&#x27;ab, a female warrior from the Banu Khazraj of Arabia, and one of the four women leaders of the 14 tribes of early Islam. Ubadya, a companion of Umar ibn al-Khattab, was appointed the first Muslim high judge of Jerusalem after its conquest in 638 C.E., together with an obligation to keep the Holy Rock of Calvary clean. Despite the noble origins, family tradition, in keeping with the belief that all great families have roots in brigandage, transmits a legend that their descent can also be traced through a long line of thieves.

According to family tradition, they retained an exclusive right to the keys of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre down to the Ottoman period, when the Joudeh family obtained a warrant to share possession. To this day, the Nusseibeh family are said to be trustees, and upon receiving the keys from a member of the Joudeh clan, the Nusseibeh are said to turn them over to the warden of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre around dawn every day. Moshe Amirav reports Nusseibeh as quipping, nonetheless, when replying in the negative to a query about his family&#x27;s possession of the keys, that:&#x27;No, there is no longer any need for it. Jesus isn&#x27;t there any more.&#x27;

Nusseibeh&#x27;s grandfather successively married into three different Palestinian families of notables, the Shihabi, noted for their scholarship; the Darwish of the powerful al-Husayni family; and to the Nashashibi, and thus, in Nusseibeh&#x27;s words: &#x27;in a matter of a few years [...] managed to stitch together four ancient Jerusalem families, two of which were bitter rivals&#x27;.

==Biography==
Nusseibeh was born in Damascus, Syria, to the politician Anwar Nusseibeh who was a distinguished statesman, prominent in Palestinian and (after 1948) Palestinian-Jordanian politics and diplomacy. His mother, Nuzha Al-Ghussein, daughter of Palestinian political leader Yaqub al-Ghusayn was born in Ramle, into a family of wealthy landed aristocrats with land in Wadi Hnein (now the Israeli town of Nes Ziona), His mother had left Palestine in 1948 to avoid the fighting, and his father lost a leg when wounded while participating in the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. They moved to Cairo some years later, where his father participated in the formation of the First Palestine Government in exile. On returning to Jerusalem, he lived just a few hundred yards over the other side of No man&#x27;s land from Amos Oz, and in reading the latter&#x27;s memoir of his upbringing, was struck by the profound differences between their respective experiences as children in the same city. Their family owned farmland in Karameh which he helped till by driving a tractor during summer vacations. It was to be the site of what in Palestinian memory became known as the bloodbath of their Palestinian Stalingrad. During Israel&#x27;s conquest of the West Bank in the Six-Day War, Israel troops sacked the family home in Jerusalem, looting it of all of their heirlooms, though the family car was later returned. Some months later, the occupation authorities then expropriated the family&#x27;s 200 acre country estate in the Jordan Valley.

In the fall of 1967, Nusseibeh went to study philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford. There he became friends with Avishai Margalit, as well as Ahmad Walidi, the only other Palestinian undergraduate there at the time, and son of the distinguished scholar Walid Khalidi. It was a period marked by student revolutionary upheavals and it was at this time that Ahmad introduced him to the intricacies of Palestinian political factions, parodied in Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Brian&quot;. The summers he spent back in Jerusalem, where, in 1968 he began studying Hebrew did a stint of work at the HaZore&#x27;a kibbutz, and, the following year, was on hand to help quench the flames caused by Australian Christian fundamentalist arsonist Michael Rohan when the latter tried to burn down the Al-Aqsa Mosque by setting alight Saladin&#x27;s 1,000 year old Aleppo pulpit.

At Oxford, Nusseibeh met Lucy Austin, the daughter of British philosopher J.L. Austin, and future founder of the NGO MEND. They were married in late 1973 by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Saad al-Din Jalal al-Alami, and their marriage gave them four children: three sons, Jamal, Absal, Buraq, and one daughter, Nuzha. While at Oxford Sari was much drawn to the linguistic philosophy introduced by Ludwig Wittgenstein and developed by Austin. After completing his Oxford degree, he spent a year at the Warburg Institute in London, after hearing a lecture by Abdulhamid Sabra which attracted him to the study of the early Islamic school of Mu&#x27;tazilite logicians, the thought of Al-Ghazali and the subsequent discursive victory of the latter, as formulated by the Ash&#x27;ari school of theologians.

After a brief period working in Abu Dhabi, Nusseibeh took up doctoral studies on the topic of Islamic Philosophy at from Harvard University, beginning in the fall of 1974, and gained his Ph.D. in (1978). He returned to the West Bank in 1978 to teach at Birzeit University (where he remained as professor of philosophy until the university was closed from 1988 to 1990 during the First Intifada). At the same time, he taught classes in Islamic philosophy at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. Through the early 1980s, he helped to organize the teachers&#x27; union at Birzeit, and served three terms as president of the union of faculty and staff there. Nusseibeh is also co-founder of the Federation of Employees in the Education Sector for all of the West Bank.

==Political activism==
Sari Nusseibeh has long been viewed as a Palestinian moderate. In July 1987, Nusseibeh and Faisal Husseini met with Moshe Amirav, a member of Israel&#x27;s Likud Party becoming the first prominent Palestinians to meet with a member of the Israeli right. Amirav was testing the waters for a group close to then prime minister Yitzhak Shamir on the possibility of making a historic pact with the PLO and Fatah.

After years of working toward the establishment of a functioning Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel, Nusseibeh was by 2011 referring to the two-state solution as a &quot;fantasy&quot;. In &quot;What&#x27;s A Palestinian State Worth?&quot; (Harvard University Press, 2011) he called for a &quot;thought experiment&quot; of a single state in which Israel annexed all the territories, and Palestinians would be &quot;second-class citizens&quot; with &quot;civil but not political rights&quot; in which &quot;Jews could run the country while the Arabs could live in it.&quot; This specific suggestion has been dismissed as &quot;disingenuous&quot;. During this time, Nusseibeh has been speaking of steps toward one version or another of a single-state solution, such as a binational state.

===The First Intifada===
Nusseibeh was also an important leader during the First Intifada, authoring the Palestinian Declaration of Principles and working to strengthen the Fatah movement in the West Bank; Nusseibeh helped to author the &quot;inside&quot; Palestinians&#x27; declaration of independence issued in the First Intifada, and to create the 200 political committees and 28 technical committees that were intended to as an embryonic infrastructure for a future Palestinian administration.

===First Gulf War===
Following the firing of Scud missiles at Tel Aviv, Nusseibeh worked with Israeli Peace Now on a common approach to condemn the killing of civilians in the war. But he was arrested and placed under administrative detention on 29 January 1991, effectively accused of being an Iraqi agent. The arrest was then questioned by British and American officials, and the U.S. administration urged that he should either be charged or else the suspicion would be that the arrest was political. He was adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. and letters of protest were written to &quot;The Times&quot; by academics including Peter Strawson, Isaiah Berlin and H. L. A. Hart. Some Israelis said the move was designed to discredit Nusseibeh before international opinion. Palestinians saw the arrest as a political warning that Israel did not intend to negotiate with any Palestinian leader, no matter how moderate. For example, Saeb Erekat of An-Najah University said: &quot;This is a message to us Palestinian moderates. The message is, &#x27;You can forget about negotiations after the war because we are going to make sure there is no one to talk to&#x27;&quot;. He was released without charge shortly after the end of the war, after 90 days of imprisonment in Ramle Prison.

===Peace initiatives and activities since 2000===
Nusseibeh was not politically active during much of the Oslo Peace Process but was appointed as the PLO Representative in Jerusalem in 2001. During this period Nusseibeh began to strongly suggest that Palestinians give up their Right of Return in exchange for a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A number of Palestinian organizations have strongly condemned his views on this issue.

Nusseibeh criticised the militarization of the intifada in January 2002 and called for the renunciation of suicide bombings and the establishment of Palestine as a demilitarized state: &quot;A Palestinian state should be demilitarized—not because that&#x27;s what Israel demands, but in our own interest.&quot; Some senior Israel figures, such as Uzi Landau rebuffed the proposal as a trick.

In 2002 Sari Nusseibeh and former Shin Bet director, Ami Ayalon published The People&#x27;s Voice, an Israeli-Palestinian civil initiative that aims to advance the process of achieving peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and a draft peace agreement that called for a Palestinian state based on Israel&#x27;s 1967 borders and for a compromise on the Palestinian Right of Return. The People&#x27;s Voice Initiative was officially launched on June 25, 2003.

In 2002, Yasser Arafat appointed Nusseibeh as the PLO&#x27;s representative in East Jerusalem, a position he assumed after the sudden death of Faisal Husseini.

In 2008, Nusseibeh said that the quest for the two-state solution was floundering. He called on Palestinians to start a debate on the idea of a one-state solution.

==Affiliations==
Nusseibeh is head and founder of the &quot;Palestinian Consultancy Group&quot;, co-founder and member of several Palestinian institutions including the &quot;Jerusalem Friends of the Sick Society&quot;, the &quot;Federation of Employees in the Education Sector in the West Bank&quot;, the &quot;Arab Council for Public Affairs&quot;, the &quot;Committee Confronting the Iron Fist&quot;, and the &quot;Jerusalem Arab Council&quot;. He is also on the advisory board of The International Center for Ethics, Justice and Public Life at Brandeis University.

Internationally, Nusseibeh is a member of the McGill Middle East Program&#x27;s Executive and Management Committees. In November 2007, following the publication of &quot;Once Upon a Country: A Palestinian Life&quot;, he traveled to Montreal, Canada, to lecture on the MMEP and his vision of peace.

<text>A decimal calendar is a calendar which includes units of time based on the decimal system. For example, a &quot;decimal month&quot; would consist of a year with 10 months and 36.52422 days per month.

==History==

===Egyptian calendar===

The ancient Egyptian calendar consisted of twelve months, each divided into three weeks of ten days, with five intercalary days.

===Calendar of Romulus===

The original Roman calendar consisted of ten months; however, the calendar year only lasted 304 days, with 61 days during winter not assigned to any month. The months of Ianuarius and Februarius were added to the calendar by Numa Pompilius in 700 BCE.

===French Republican Calendar===

The French Republican Calendar was introduced (along with decimal time) in 1793, and was similar to the ancient Egyptian calendar. It consisted of twelve months, each divided into three &quot;décades&quot; of ten days, with five or six intercalary days called &quot;sansculottides&quot;. The calendar was abolished by Napoleon on January 1, 1806.

==Proposals==

The modern Gregorian calendar does not use decimal units of time; however, several proposed calendar systems do. None of these have achieved widespread use.

<doc id="162615" wikidata="Q689846" url="?curid=162615" title="Assisted suicide">
<text>Assisted suicide, also known as physician-assisted suicide (PAS), is the process by which a person, with the help of others, takes drugs to end their life.

This medical practice is an end-of-life measure for a person suffering a painful, terminal illness. Once it is determined that the person&#x27;s situation qualifies under the laws for that location, the physician&#x27;s assistance is usually limited to writing a prescription for a lethal dose of drugs. This practice falls under the concept of the medical right to die, i.e. the right of a person to choose when and how they will die, either through medical aid in dying or refusing life-saving medical treatment.

Assisted suicide is legal in some countries, under certain circumstances, including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, parts of the United States and all six states in Australia. The constitutional courts of Colombia, Ecuador and Italy have legalized assisted suicide, but their governments have not yet legislated or regulated the practice.

==Restrictions==

To qualify for medical aid in dying, individuals must meet strict criteria, which may include:

* they have a terminal or incurable illness or disability
* they are of sound mind
* they voluntarily and repeatedly express their wish to die
* they take the specified, lethal dose by their own hand

Laws vary in scope from place to place. In the United States, medical aid in dying is limited to those who have a prognosis of less than six months to live. In other countries, such as in Switzerland, a terminal diagnosis is not a strict requirement.

==Terminology==

This practice is referred to using a wide range of terminologies. These include:

* medical aid in dying (MAID)
* medical assistance in dying (MAiD)
* assisted dying
* physician-assisted death (PAD)
* physician-assisted suicide (PAS)
* assisted suicide

However, all of these terminologies refer to the same medical practice, in which a physician indirectly assists another person to end their own life. It involves a physician &quot;knowingly and intentionally providing a person with the knowledge or means or both required to commit suicide, including counseling about lethal doses of drugs, prescribing such lethal doses or supplying the drugs&quot;. This is a regulated practice in which the patient must meet very strict criteria in order to receive medical assistance in dying.

===Related terms===
Assisted dying should not be confused with euthanasia, which is a different practice and occurs when somebody directly brings about the death of another. Euthanasia can occur with or without consent, and can be classified as voluntary (the person consents), non-voluntary (the person is unable to provide consent) or involuntary (the person does not give consent).

===Concerns about use of the term &quot;assisted suicide&quot;===
Some advocates for assisted dying strongly oppose the terms &quot;assisted suicide&quot; and &quot;suicide&quot;, and prefer terms such as &quot;medical aid in dying&quot; or &quot;assisted dying&quot;. The motivation for this is to distance the debate from suicides commonly performed by those not terminally ill, as they believe that the use of &quot;suicide&quot; is not an accurate representation of the medical practice.

In November 2022 at its biannual Annual General Meeting, the World Federation of Right to Die Societies discussed and adopted the phrase &quot;voluntary assisted dying&quot; as the preferred terminology for this medical practice.

==Arguments for and against==

===Arguments for===
Arguments in support of assisted suicide include
* reduction of human suffering 
* compassion
* respect for patient autonomy
* personal liberty
* equal treatment of terminally ill patients on and off life support
* transparency
* ethics of responsibility

====Reasons given by people for seeking assisted suicide====
In 2022 in the Oregon program, the most frequently reported end-of-life concerns were 
* decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable (89%)
* loss of autonomy (86%) 
* loss of dignity (62%)
* burden on family/caregivers (46%)
* losing control of bodily functions (44%)
* inadequate pain control, or concern about it (31%)
* financial implications of treatment (6%) 
Previous years had seen similar factors. 
Pain has mostly not been reported as the primary motivation for seeking assisted suicide in the United States.

===Arguments against===

Arguments against assisted dying are
* lack of genuine consent. Some are concerned that vulnerable populations may be at risk of untimely deaths because &quot;patients might be subjected to PAD without their genuine consent&quot;. 
* slippery slope. This concern is that once assisted suicide is initiated for the terminally ill it will progress to other vulnerable communities, namely disabled people, and may begin to be used by those who feel less worthy based on their demographic or socioeconomic status. The UK Government Health and Social Care Select Committee found no evidence of the ‘slippery slope’ having occurred when it examined the global assisted suicide situation in 2024.

==Opinions==

===Medical ethics===
====Hippocratic Oath====
Some doctors state that physician-assisted suicide is contrary to the Hippocratic Oath (c. 400 BC), which is the oath historically taken by physicians. It states &quot;I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel&quot;. The original oath however has been modified many times and, contrary to popular belief, is not required by most modern medical schools, nor confers any legal obligations on individuals who choose to take it. There are also procedures forbidden by the Hippocratic Oath that are in common practice today, such as abortion and execution.

====Declaration of Geneva====
The Declaration of Geneva is a revision of the Hippocratic Oath, first drafted in 1948 by the World Medical Association in response to forced (involuntary) euthanasia, eugenics and other medical crimes performed in Nazi Germany. It contains, &quot;I will respect the autonomy and dignity of my patient&quot;, as well as &quot;I will maintain the utmost respect for human life.&quot;

====International Code of Medical Ethics====
The International Code of Medical Ethics, last revised in 2006, includes &quot;A physician shall always bear in mind the obligation to respect human life&quot; in the section &quot;Duties of physicians to patients&quot;.

====Statement of Marbella====
The Statement of Marbella was adopted by the 44th World Medical Assembly in Marbella, Spain, in 1992. It provides that &quot;physician-assisted suicide, like voluntary euthanasia, is unethical and must be condemned by the medical profession.&quot;

====American Medical Association Code of Ethics ====
As of 2022, the American Medical Association (AMA) opposed medical aid in dying. In response to the ongoing debate about medical aid in dying, the AMA has issued guidance for both those who support and oppose physician-assisted suicide. The AMA Code of Ethics Opinion 5.7 reads that &quot;Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician&#x27;s role as healer&quot; and that it would be &quot;difficult or impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks&quot; but does not explicitly prohibit the practice. In the AMA Code of Ethics Opinion 1.1.7, which the AMA states &quot;articulates the thoughtful moral basis for those who support assisted suicide&quot;, it is written that outside of specific situations in which physicians have clear obligations, such as emergency care or respect for civil rights, &quot;physicians may be able to act (or refrain from acting) in accordance with the dictates of their conscience without violating their professional obligations.&quot;

===Religious stances===
====Religious stances in favor ====
=====Unitarian Universalism=====
According to a 1988 General Resolution, &quot;Unitarian Universalists advocate the right to self-determination in dying, and the release from civil or criminal penalties of those who, under proper safeguards, act to honor the right of terminally ill patients to select the time of their own deaths&quot;.

====Religious stances in opposition ====
=====Catholicism=====
The Catholic Church acknowledges the fact that moral decisions regarding a person&#x27;s life must be made according to one&#x27;s own conscience and faith. Catholic tradition has said that one&#x27;s concern for the suffering of another is not a sufficient reason to decide whether it is appropriate to act upon voluntary euthanasia. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, &quot;God is the creator and author of all life.&quot; In this belief system God created human life, therefore God is the judge of when to end life. From the Catholic Church&#x27;s perspective, deliberately ending one&#x27;s life or the life of another is morally wrong and defies the Catholic doctrine. Furthermore, ending one&#x27;s life deprives that person and his or her loved ones of the time left in life and causes grief and sorrow for those left behind.

Pope Francis affirms that death is a glorious event and should not be decided for by anyone other than God. Pope Francis insinuates that defending life means defending its sacredness. The Catholic Church teaches its followers that the act of euthanasia is unacceptable because it is perceived as a sin, as it goes against one of the Ten Commandments. As implied by the fifth commandment, &quot;Thou shalt not kill (You shall not kill)&quot;, the act of assisted suicide contradicts the dignity of human life as well as the respect one has for God. Additionally, the Catholic Church recommends that terminally ill patients should receive palliative care, which deals with physical pain while treating psychological and spiritual suffering as well, instead of physician-assisted suicide.

===== Hinduism =====
In Hinduism, suicide is viewed as a serious act because it conflicts with core principles like Dharma (duty), Karma (actions and their consequences), and Ahimsa (non-violence). While there is no definitive teaching on suicide and assisted suicide within Hinduism, prematurely ending one&#x27;s life or assisting in such an act can adversely affect the karma of both the person who dies and the one who aids in the act. Deepak Sarma, a professor of South Asian religions and philosophy at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, explains, &quot;If you circumvent karma by taking some action to stop suffering, you will pay for it later.&quot;. Hinduism upholds the principle of &quot;Ahimsa Paramo Dharma&quot;, meaning &quot;Ahimsa (non-violence) is the highest form of dharma (virtue)&quot;. Although, Hindus are not meant to be indifferent to the sufferings of others. One should avoid committing acts of violence in thought, word, or deed against any living creature. Therefore, the practice of euthanasia would be seen as breaching the teachings of ahimsa.

=====Judaism=====
While preservation of life is one of the greatest values in Judaism, there are instances of suicide and assisted suicide appearing in the Bible and Rabbinic literature. The medieval authorities debate the legitimacy of those measures and in what limited circumstances they might apply. The conclusion of the majority of later rabbinic authorities, and accepted normative practice within Judaism, is that suicide and assisted suicide can not be sanctioned even for a terminal patient in intractable pain.

=====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints=====
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is against assisted suicide and euthanasia, and anyone who takes part in either is regarded as having violated the commandments of God. However the church recognizes that when a person is in the final stages of terminal illness there may be difficult decisions to be taken. The church states that &quot;When dying becomes inevitable, death should be looked upon as a blessing and a purposeful part of an eternal existence. Members should not feel obligated to extend mortal life by means that are unreasonable&quot;.

=====Islam=====
According to a rigid approach, the Muslim doctor should not intervene directly to voluntarily take the life of the patient, not even out of pity (Islamic Code of Medical Ethics, Kuwait 1981); he must see whether the patient is curable or not, not whether he must continue to live. Similarly, he must not administer drugs that accelerate death, even after an explicit request by relatives; acceleration of this kind would correspond to murder. Quran 3.145 states: &quot;Nor can a soul die except by God&#x27;s leave, the term being fixed as by writing&quot;; Quran 3.156 continues &quot;It is God that gives Life and Death, and God sees well all that ye do&quot;, resulting that God has fixed the length of each life, but leaves room for human efforts to save it when some hope exists. The patient&#x27;s request for his life to be ended has in part been evaluated by juridical doctrine in some aspects. The four &quot;canonical&quot; Sunnite juridical schools (Hanafi te, Malikite, Shafi &#x27;ite and Hanbalite) were not unanimous in their pronouncements. For all, the request or permission to be killed does not make the action, which remains a murder, lawful; however, the disagreement concerns the possibility of applying punishments to those that cause death: the Hanafi tes are in favour; the Hanbalites, the Shafi &#x27;ites and the Malikites are partly in favour and partly contrary to penal sanctions.

In June 1995 the Muslim Medical Doctors Conference in Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur) reasserted that euthanasia (not better defined) goes against the principles of Islam; this is also valid in the military context, prohibiting a seriously wounded soldier from committing suicide or asking other soldiers to kill him out of pity or to avoid falling into enemy hands.

===Organisations taking neutral positions===
There have been calls for organisations representing medical professionals to take a neutral stance on medical aid in dying, rather than a position of opposition. The reasoning is that this supposedly would better reflect the views of medical professionals and that of wider society, and prevent those bodies from exerting undue influence over the debate.

The UK Royal College of Nursing voted in July 2009 to move to a neutral position on medical aid in dying.

The California Medical Association dropped its long-standing opposition in 2015 during the debate over whether a medical aid in dying bill should be introduced there, prompted in part by cancer sufferer Brittany Maynard. The California End of Life Option Act was signed into law later that year.

In December 2017, the Massachusetts Medical Society (MMS) voted to repeal their opposition to medical aid in dying and adopt a position of neutrality.

In October 2018, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) voted to adopt a position of neutrality from one of opposition. This is contrary to the position taken by the American Medical Association (AMA), which opposes it.

In January 2019 the British Royal College of Physicians announced it would adopt a position of neutrality until two-thirds of its members think it should either support or oppose the legalization of medical aid in dying.

In September 2021, the largest doctors union in the United Kingdom, the British Medical Association, adopted a neutral stance towards a change in the law on assisted dying, replacing their position of opposition which had been in place since 2006.

===Attitudes of healthcare professionals===
In many medical aid in dying programs, physicians play a significant role, usually expressed as &quot;gatekeeper&quot;, often putting them at the forefront of the issue. Decades of opinion research show that physicians in the US and several European countries are less supportive of the legalization of medical aid in dying than the general public. In the US, although &quot;about two-thirds of the American public since the 1970s&quot; have supported legalization, surveys of physicians &quot;rarely show as much as half supporting a move&quot;. However, physician and other healthcare professional opinions vary widely on the issue of physician-assisted suicide, as shown in the following tables.

A 2019 survey of US physicians found that 60% of physicians answered &#x27;yes&#x27; to the question &quot;Should PAS be legalized in your state?&quot; The survey discovered that physicians are concerned about a possible &quot;slippery slope&quot;. 30% agreed that &quot;PAS/AID would lead to the legalization of euthanasia&quot; and 46% agreed that &quot;Health insurance companies would cover PAS/AID over more expensive, possibly life-saving treatments, like chemotherapy&quot;. The survey also found that physicians generally misunderstand why patients seek PAS. 49% of physicians agreed that &quot;Most patients who seek PAS/AID do so because of physical pain&quot;, whereas studies in Oregon found that &quot;the three most frequently mentioned end-of-life concerns were loss of autonomy (89.5%), decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable (89.5%), and loss of dignity (65.4%).&quot; In addition, the survey found uncertainty about the adequacy of safeguards. While 59% agreed that &quot;Current PAS laws provide adequate safeguards&quot;, there was greater concern with respect to specific safeguards. 60% disagreed that &quot;Physicians who are not psychiatrists are sufficiently trained to screen for depression in patients who are seeking PAS&quot; and 60% disagreed that &quot;Most physicians can predict with certainty whether a patient seeking PAS/AID has 6 months or less to live&quot;. The concern about adequate safeguards is even greater among Oregon emergency physicians, among whom one study found that &quot;Only 37% indicated that the Oregon initiative has enough safeguards to protect vulnerable persons.&quot;

Attitudes toward medical aid in dying vary by health profession as well; an extensive survey of 3,733 medical physicians was sponsored by the National Council for Palliative Care, Age Concern, Help the Hospices, Macmillan Cancer Support, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, the MS Society and Sue Ryder Care showed that opposition to voluntary euthanasia and PAS was highest among Palliative Care and Care of the Elderly specialists, with more than 90% of palliative care specialists against a change in the law.

A 1997 study by Glasgow University&#x27;s Institute of Law &amp; Ethics in Medicine found pharmacists (72%) and anaesthetists (56%) to be generally in favor of legalizing PAS. Pharmacists were twice as likely as medical GPs to endorse the view that &quot;if a patient has decided to end their own life then doctors should be allowed in law to assist&quot;. A report published in January 2017 by NPR suggests that the thoroughness of protections that allow physicians to refrain from participating in the municipalities that legalized assisted suicide within the United States presently creates a lack of access by those who would otherwise be eligible for the practice.

A poll in the United Kingdom showed that 54% of General Practitioners are either supportive or neutral towards the introduction of assisted dying laws. A similar poll on Doctors.net.uk published in the BMJ said that 55% of doctors would support it. In contrast the BMA, which represents doctors in the UK, opposes it.

An anonymous, confidential postal survey of all General Practitioners in Northern Ireland, conducted in the year 2000, found that over 70% of responding GPs were opposed to physician-assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia.

===Public opinion on medical aid in dying===
====U.S. polls====
Polls conducted by Gallup dating back to 1947 posit the question, &quot;When a person has a disease that cannot be cured, do you think doctors should be allowed to end the patient&#x27;s life by some painless means if the patient and his family request it?&quot; show support for the practice increasing from 37% in 1947 to a plateau of approximately 75% lasting from approximately 1990 to 2005. When the polling question was modified as such so the question posits &quot;severe pain&quot; as opposed to an incurable disease, &quot;legalization&quot; as opposed to generally allowing doctors, and &quot;patient suicide&quot; rather than physician-administered voluntary euthanasia, public support was substantially lower, by approximately 10% to 15%.

A poll conducted by National Journal and Regence Foundation found that both Oregonians and Washingtonians were more familiar with the terminology &quot;end-of-life care&quot; than the rest of the country and residents of both states are slightly more aware of the terms palliative and hospice care.

A survey from the Journal of Palliative Medicine found that family caregivers of patients who chose assisted death were more likely to find positive meaning in caring for a patient and were more prepared for accepting a patient&#x27;s death than the family caregivers of patients who did not request assisted death.

==Legality by country and region==

Medical aid in dying is legal in some countries, under certain circumstances, including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, parts of the United States (California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Washington DC) and Australia (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia). The Constitutional Courts of Colombia, Ecuador, Germany and Italy legalized assisted suicide, but their governments have not legislated or regulated the practice yet.

===Australia===
Laws regarding assisted suicide in Australia are a matter for state and territory governments. Physician assisted suicide is currently legal in all Australian states: New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. It remains illegal in all Australian territories, however the Australian Capital Territory plans to legalise this by 2024, and the Northern Territory is holding an investigation due to report in 2024.

Under Victorian law, patients can ask medical practitioners about assisted suicide, and doctors, including conscientious objectors, should refer to appropriately trained colleagues who do not conscientiously object. Health practitioners are restricted from initiating conversation or suggesting VAD to a patient unprompted.

Physician assisted suicide was legal in the Northern Territory for a short time under the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995, until this law was overturned by the Federal Parliament which also removed the ability for territories to pass legislation relating to assisted dying, however this prohibition was repealed in December 2022 with the passing of Restoring Territory Rights Act 2022. The highly controversial &#x27;Euthanasia Machine&#x27;, the first invented voluntary assisted dying machine of its kind, created by Philip Nitschke, utilised during this period is presently held at London&#x27;s Science Museum.

===Austria===

In December 2020, the Austrian Constitutional Court ruled that the prohibition of assisted suicide was unconstitutional. In December 2021, the Austrian Parliament legalized assisted suicide for those who are terminally ill or have a permanent, debilitating condition.

===Belgium===
The Euthanasia Act legalized voluntary euthanasia in Belgium in 2002, but it did not cover physician-assisted suicide.

===Canada===
In Canada, physician-assisted suicide was first legalized in the province of Quebec on 5 June 2014. It was declared nationally legal by the Supreme Court of Canada on 6 February 2015, in &quot;Carter v. Canada (Attorney General)&quot;.

National legislation formalizing physician-assisted suicide passed in mid-June 2016, for patients facing an estimated death within six months. Eligibility criteria have been progressively expanded over time. As of March 2021, individuals no longer need to be terminally ill in order to qualify for assisted suicide. Legislation allowing for assisted suicide for mental illness was expected to come into force on 17 March 2023, but has since been postponed until 2027.

Between 10 December 2015 and 30 June 2017, 2,149 medically assisted deaths were documented in Canada. Research published by Health Canada illustrates physician preference for physician-administered voluntary euthanasia, citing concerns about effective administration and prevention of the potential complications of self-administration by patients.

===China===
In China, assisted suicide is illegal under Articles 232 and 233 of the Criminal Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In China, suicide or neglect is considered homicide and can be punished by three to seven years in prison.
In May 2011, Zhong Yichun, a farmer, was sentenced to two years imprisonment by the People&#x27;s Court of Longnan County, in China&#x27;s Jiangxi Province for assisting Zeng Qianxiang to die by suicide. Zeng had a mental illness and repeatedly asked Zhong to help him die by suicide. In October 2010, Zeng took excessive sleeping pills and lay in a cave. As planned, Zhong called him 15 minutes later to confirm that he was dead and buried him. However, according to the autopsy report, the cause of death was from suffocation, not an overdose. Zhong was convicted of criminal negligence. In August 2011, Zhong appealed the court sentence, but it was rejected.

In 1992, a physician was accused of murdering a patient with advanced cancer by lethal injection. He was eventually acquitted.

===Colombia===
In May 1997 the Colombian Constitutional Court allowed for the voluntary euthanasia of sick patients who requested to end their lives, by passing Article 326 of the 1980 Penal Code. This ruling owes its success to the efforts of a group that strongly opposed voluntary euthanasia. When one of its members brought a lawsuit to the Colombian Supreme Court against it, the court issued a 6 to 3 decision that &quot;spelled out the rights of a terminally ill person to engage in voluntary euthanasia&quot;.

===Denmark===
Assisted suicide is illegal in Denmark. Passive euthanasia, or the refusal to accept treatment, is not illegal. A survey from 2014 found that 71% of Denmark&#x27;s population was in favor of legalizing voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.

===France===
Assisted suicide is not legal in France. The controversy over legalising voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide is not as big as in the United States because of the country&#x27;s &quot;well developed hospice care programme&quot;. However, in 2000 the controversy over the topic was ignited with . After a car crash that left him &quot;unable to &#x27;walk, see, speak, smell or taste&#x27;&quot;, he used the movement of his right thumb to write a book, &quot;I Ask the Right to Die ()&quot;, in which he voiced his desire to &quot;die legally&quot;. After his appeal was denied, his mother assisted in killing him by injecting him with an overdose of barbiturates that put him into a coma, killing him two days later. Though his mother was arrested for aiding in her son&#x27;s death and later acquitted, the case did jump-start new legislation which states that when medicine serves &quot;no other purpose than the artificial support of life&quot; it can be &quot;suspended or not undertaken&quot;.

===Germany===
Killing somebody in accordance with their demands is always illegal under the German criminal code (Paragraph 216, &quot;Killing at the request of the victim&quot;).

That said, assisting suicide is now generally legal as the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in 2020 that it is generally protected under the Basic Law. This milestone decision overturned a ban on the commercialization of assisted suicide and set out an entirely new course for countries or jurisdictions contemplating such a provision. Since suicide itself is legal, assistance or encouragement is not punishable by the usual legal mechanisms dealing with complicity and incitement (German criminal law follows the idea of &quot;accessories of complicity&quot; which states that &quot;the motives of a person who incites another person to commit suicide, or who assists in its commission, are irrelevant&quot;). Whereas the traditional approach for establishing an assisted dying service has always been based on identifying criteria for who was eligible for it predicated on a view regarding a person&#x27;s acceptable quality of life (e.g. condition of health or illness), the ruling by the German court stated that government in pluralist societies can not do so as it would violate one&#x27;s autonomy, the principle of person-state separation. That suggests an alternative model for an assisted dying regime similar to that in Switzerland where no government legislated regime was created but where the provision has existed for decades.

====Travel to Switzerland====
Between 1998 and 2018 around 1,250 German citizens (almost three times the number of any other nationality) travelled to Dignitas in Zurich, Switzerland, for an assisted suicide, where this has been legal since 1998. Switzerland is one of the few countries that permit assisted suicide for non-resident foreigners.

====Physician-assisted suicide====
Physician-assisted suicide was formally legalised on 26 February 2020 when Germany&#x27;s top court removed the prohibition of &quot;professionally assisted suicide&quot;.

===Iceland===
Assisted suicide is illegal.

===Ireland===
Assisted suicide is illegal. &quot;Both euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal under Irish law. Depending on the circumstances, euthanasia is regarded as either manslaughter or murder and is punishable by up to life imprisonment.&quot;

=== Italy ===
In Italy, assisted suicide has been conditionally allowed since 2019 under specific circumstances following the Italian Constitutional Court ruling 242/2019.

While active euthanasia remains illegal, assisted suicide is permitted if the following conditions are met:

*The patient suffers from an irreversible condition.
*The patient experiences physical or psychological suffering that they deem unbearable.
*The patient is dependent on life-sustaining treatments.
*The patient is fully capable of making free and informed decisions.

The aforementioned conditions, as well as the methods of assistance for a freely and autonomously requested assisted suicide, must be verified by a public healthcare structure with prior approval from the relevant ethics committee.

In 2024 the Court upheld its previous ruling and clarified that:

*life-sustaining treatments are not limited to those administered by medical staff but can also include those provided by family members or caregivers
*the ruling also applies to patients who require life-sustaining treatments but have chosen to refuse them.

As of February 2025, the Italian Parliament has not yet legislated on the regulation of assisted suicide, while the Regional Council of Tuscany has passed a regional law outlining organizational procedures for implementing Constitutional Court rulings, and the Regional Councils of Apulia and Emilia-Romagna have taken administrative action through regional resolutions. The remaining 17 Italian regions still need to intervene in establishing procedures and timelines.

On 16 June 2022, the first assisted suicide was performed. As of 14 February 2025, six people have received assisted suicide in Italy.

===Jersey===
On 25 November 2021, the States Assembly voted to legalise assisted dying and a law legalising it will be drafted in due course. The Channel Island is the first country in the British Islands to approve the measure. The proposition, which was lodged by the Council of Ministers, proposes that a legal assisted dying service should be set up for residents over the age of 18 with a terminal illness or other incurable suffering. The service will be voluntary and methods are either physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia.

This follows a campaign and overwhelming public support. Paul Gazzard and his late husband Alain du Chemin were key actors in the campaign in favour of legalising assisted dying. A citizen&#x27;s jury was established, which recommended that assisted dying be legalised in the island.

===Luxembourg===
After again failing to get royal assent for legalizing voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, in December 2008 Luxembourg&#x27;s parliament amended the country&#x27;s constitution to take this power away from the monarch, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide were legalized in the country in April 2009.

===Netherlands===

In 2002, the Netherlands became the first country in the world to formally legalise voluntary euthanasia. Physician-assisted suicide is legal under the same conditions as voluntary euthanasia. Physician-assisted suicide became allowed under the act approved in 2001 which became effective in 2002 and states the specific procedures and requirements needed in order to provide such assistance. Assisted suicide in the Netherlands follows a medical model which means that only doctors of patients who are suffering &quot;unbearably without hope&quot; are allowed to grant a request for an assisted suicide. The Netherlands allows people over the age of 12 to pursue an assisted suicide when deemed necessary.

===New Zealand===
Assisted suicide was decriminalised after a binding referendum in 2020 on New Zealand&#x27;s End of Life Choice Act 2019. The legislation provided for a year-long delay before it took effect on 6 November 2021. Under Section 179 of the Crimes Act 1961, it is illegal to &#x27;aid and abet suicide&#x27; and this will remain the case outside the framework established under the End of Life Choice Act.

===Norway===
Assisted suicide is illegal in Norway. It is considered murder and is punishable by up to 21 years imprisonment.

===Portugal===
The Law n.º 22/2023, of 22 May, legalized physician-assisted death, which can be done by physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. Physician-assisted death can only be permitted to adults, by their own decision, who are experiencing suffering of great intensity and who have a permanent injury of extreme severity or a serious and incurable disease.

The law is not yet in force, because the government has to regulate it first. It states in Article 31 that the regulation must be approved within 90 days of the publishing of the law, which would have been 23 August 2023. However, the regulation has not yet been approved by the government. According to Article 34, the law will only enter into force 30 days after the regulation is published. On 24 November 2023, the Ministry of Health said the regulation of the law would be the responsibility of the new government elected in the 10 March 2024 elections.

===South Africa===
South Africa is struggling with the debate over legalizing voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Owing to the underdeveloped health care system that pervades the majority of the country, Willem Landman, &quot;a member of the South African Law Commission, at a symposium on euthanasia at the World Congress of Family Doctors&quot; stated that many South African doctors would be willing to perform acts of voluntary euthanasia when it became legalized in the country. He feels that because of the lack of doctors in the country, &quot;[legalizing] euthanasia in South Africa would be premature and difficult to put into practice ...&quot;.

On 30 April 2015, the High Court in Pretoria granted Advocate Robin Stransham-Ford an order that would allow a doctor to assist him in taking his own life without the threat of prosecution. On 6 December 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned the High Court ruling.

===Switzerland===
Though it is illegal to assist a patient in dying in some circumstances, there are others where there is no offence committed. The relevant provision of the Swiss Criminal Code refers to &quot;a person who, for selfish reasons, incites someone to commit suicide or who assists that person in doing so will, if the suicide was carried out or attempted, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment (&quot;Zuchthaus&quot;) of up to 5 years or a term of imprisonment (&quot;Gefängnis&quot;).&quot;

A person brought to court on a charge could presumably avoid conviction by proving that they were &quot;motivated by the good intentions of bringing about a requested death for the purposes of relieving &quot;suffering&quot; rather than for &quot;selfish&quot; reasons. In order to avoid conviction, the person has to prove that the deceased knew what he or she was doing, had the capacity to make the decision, and had made an &quot;earnest&quot; request, meaning they asked for death several times. The person helping also has to avoid actually doing the act that leads to death, lest they be convicted under Article 114: Killing on request (Tötung auf Verlangen) –
A person who, for decent reasons, especially compassion, kills a person on the basis of his or her serious and insistent request, will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment (Gefängnis). For instance, it should be the suicide subject who actually presses the syringe or takes the pill, after the helper had prepared the setup. This way the country can criminalise certain controversial acts, which many of its people would oppose, while legalising a narrow range of assistive acts for some of those seeking help to end their lives.

Switzerland is the only country in the world which permits assisted suicide for non-resident foreigners, causing what some critics have described as suicide tourism. Between 1998 and 2018 around 1250 German citizens (almost three times the number of any other nationality) travelled to Dignitas in Zurich, Switzerland, for an assisted suicide. During the same period over 400 British citizens also opted to end their life at the same clinic.

In May 2011, Zurich held a referendum that asked voters whether (i) assisted suicide should be prohibited outright; and (ii) whether Dignitas and other assisted suicide providers should not admit overseas users. Zurich voters heavily rejected both bans, despite anti-euthanasia lobbying from two Swiss social conservative political parties, the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland and Federal Democratic Union. The outright ban proposal was rejected by 84% of voters, while 78% voted to keep services open should overseas users require them.

In Switzerland non-physician-assisted suicide is legal, the assistance mostly being provided by volunteers, whereas in Belgium and the Netherlands, a physician must be present. In Switzerland, the doctors are primarily there to assess the patient&#x27;s decision capacity and prescribe the lethal drugs. Additionally, unlike cases in the United States, a person is not required to have a terminal illness but only the capacity to make decisions. About 25% of people in Switzerland who take advantage of assisted suicide do not have a terminal illness but are simply old or &quot;tired of life&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
Deliberately assisting a suicide is illegal. Between 2003 and 2006, Lord Joffe made four attempts to introduce bills that would have legalised physician-assisted suicide in England and Wales. All were rejected by the UK Parliament. In the meantime, the Director of Public Prosecutions has clarified the criteria under which an individual will be prosecuted in England and Wales for assisting in another person&#x27;s suicide. These have not been tested by an appellate court as yet.
In 2014, Lord Falconer of Thoroton tabled an Assisted Dying Bill in the House of Lords which passed its Second Reading but ran out of time before the general election. During its passage peers voted down two amendments which were proposed by opponents of the Bill. In 2015, Labour MP Rob Marris introduced another Bill, based on the Falconer proposals, in the House of Commons. The Second Reading was the first time the House was able to vote on the issue since 1997. A Populus poll had found that 82% of the British public agreed with the proposals of Lord Falconer&#x27;s Assisted Dying Bill. However, in a free vote on 11 September 2015, only 118 MPs were in favour and 330 against, thus defeating the bill. Another bill called Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill on assisted suicide for terminally ill adults was voted on and passed on 29 November 2024, upon second reading. Further stages of Parliament&#x27;s consideration of the bill should proceed.

====Scotland====
Unlike the other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom, suicide was not illegal in Scotland before 1961 (and still is not) thus no associated offences were created in imitation. Depending on the actual nature of any assistance given to a suicide, the offences of murder or culpable homicide might be committed or there might be no offence at all; the nearest modern prosecutions bearing comparison might be those where a culpable homicide conviction has been obtained when drug addicts have died unintentionally after being given &quot;hands on&quot; non-medical assistance with an injection. Modern law regarding the assistance of someone who intends to die has a lack of certainty as well as a lack of relevant case law; this has led to attempts to introduce statutes providing more certainty.

Independent MSP Margo MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;End of Life Assistance Bill&quot; was brought before the Scottish Parliament to permit physician-assisted suicide in January 2010. The Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland, the largest denomination in Scotland, opposed the bill. The bill was rejected by a vote of 85–16 (with 2 abstentions) in December 2010.

 The Assisted Suicide (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 13 November 2013 by the late Margo MacDonald MSP and was taken up by Patrick Harvie MSP on Ms MacDonald&#x27;s death. The Bill entered the main committee scrutiny stage in January 2015 and reached a vote in Parliament several months later; however the bill was again rejected.

The Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill was introduced by Liam McArthur MSP on 27 March 2024. It would allow terminally adults to request and receive assistance from medical professionals to end their life.

====Northern Ireland====
Health is a devolved matter in the United Kingdom and as such it would be for the Northern Ireland Assembly to legislate for assisted dying as it sees fit. As of 2018, there has been no such bill tabled in the Assembly.

===United States===
Physician-assisted dying was first legalized by the 1994 Oregon Death with Dignity Act, with effect delayed by lawsuits until 1997. As of 2025, it is legal in the following states and districts:

* Oregon since 1997
* Washington (state) since 2008 
* Montana since 2009
* Vermont since 2013 
* California since 2015
* Colorado since 2016 
* Washington, D.C. since 2017
* Hawaii since 2018 
* New Jersey since 2019 
* Maine since 2020
* New Mexico since 2021

Montana is the only state in which medical aid in dying is legal due to a court ruling, rather than a state law. The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Baxter v. Montana&quot; (2009) that it found no state law or public policy reason that would prohibit physician-assisted dying.

Access to the procedure is generally restricted to people with a terminal illness and less than six months to live. Patients are generally required to be mentally capable, to get approval from multiple doctors, and to affirm the request multiple times.

For states in which it is illegal, the punishment for participating in medical aid in dying varies. For example, the state of Wyoming does not &quot;recognize common law crimes and does not have a statute specifically prohibiting physician-assisted suicide&quot;. While in Florida, &quot;every person deliberately assisting another in the commission of self-murder shall be guilty of manslaughter, a felony of the second degree&quot;.

===Uruguay===
Assisted suicide, while criminal, does not appear to have caused any convictions, as article 37 of the Penal Code (effective 1934) states: &quot;The judges are authorized to forego punishment of a person whose previous life has been honorable where he commits a homicide motivated by compassion, induced by repeated requests of the victim.&quot;

==Safeguards==
Many current assisted death laws contain provisions that are intended to provide oversight and investigative processes to prevent abuse. This includes eligibility and qualification processes, mandatory state reporting by the medical team, and medical board oversight. In Oregon and other states, two doctors and two witnesses must assert that a person&#x27;s request for a lethal prescription was not coerced or under undue influence.

These safeguards include proving one&#x27;s residency and eligibility. The patient must meet with two physicians and they must confirm the diagnoses before one can continue the procedure; in some cases, they do include a psychiatric evaluation as well to determine whether or not the patient is making this decision on their own. The next steps are two oral requests, a waiting period of a minimum of 15 days before making the next request. A written request which must be witnessed by two different people, one of which cannot be a family member, and then another waiting period by the patient&#x27;s doctor in which they say whether they are eligible for the drugs or not (&quot;Death with Dignity&quot;).

The debate about whether these safeguards work is debated between opponents and proponents.

A 1996 survey of Oregon emergency physicians found that &quot;Only 37% indicated that the Oregon initiative has enough safeguards to protect vulnerable persons.&quot;

==Criteria==

In some programs, when death is imminent (half a year or less) patients can choose to have assisted death as a medical option to shorten what the person perceives to be an unbearable dying process.

In Canada and some European countries eligibility also includes ‘unbearable suffering’, i.e. the person does not need to be terminally ill.

In the Dignitas program, criteria include that the person;
* have a disease which will lead to death (terminal illness), and/or an unendurable incapacitating disability, and/or unbearable and uncontrollable pain.
* be of sound judgement
* be able themselves to action the last stage – to swallow, administer the gastric tube or open the valve of the intravenous access tube.

==Methods==

===Medications===
Assisted suicide is typically undertaken using medications.

In Canada a sequence of midazolam, propofol and rocuronium
is used.

In the Netherlands very high-dose barbiturates were recommended by the Netherland&#x27;s Guidelines for the Practice of Euthanasia.

In Oregon, in 2022, more than 70% of ingestions used the drug combination DDMAPh (diazepam, digoxin, morphine sulfate, amitriptyline, phenobarbital), and 28% used the drug combination DDMA (diazepam, digoxin, morphine sulfate, amitriptyline). These medication combinations have largely replaced the use of individual medications in previous years. Over 2001–22, the median time to death for DDMAPh was 42 minutes and for DDMA 49 minutes.

Other US states also use drug combinations in assisted suicide programs.

In the Dignitas program in Switzerland, after taking an anti-emetic, the person ingests sodium pentobarbital (NaP), usually 15 grams. This is normally drunk in water, but may be ingested by gastric tube or intravenously. In the Swiss Pegasos program, sodium pentobarbital is taken intravenously.
Medications that have been used in assisted suicide include
* Barbiturates, particularly secobarbital (brand name Seconal) and pentobarbital
* Propofol
* Midazolam
* Rocuronium
* Combinations of medications are sometimes used.

Other medications and medication combinations have been considered.

Little research has been done on brain activity, blood levels or lung impacts during dying by these medications.

===Gases===
Inert gas asphyxiation by nitrogen has been used in assisted suicide (and also in legal execution).

===Medical staff, provider or other person may be present===

Medical staff may be involved as &#x27;gatekeepers&#x27;. Volunteers may be present. However, in the Oregon programme in 2022, no provider or volunteer was present in 28% of cases when meds were ingested, and in 55% of cases at time of death.

===Duo-euthanasia===
In duo-euthanasia partners die together. In the Netherlands 66 people (33 couples) died by duo-euthanasia in 2023.

===Organ donation===
In the Netherlands assisted dying followed by organ donation is legal.

==Statistics on medical aid in dying programs==
===Statistics by leading countries===
Countries with the highest levels of assisted dying, as of 2021 data, are
*Canada 10,064
*Netherlands 7,666
*Belgium 2,699
*USA 1,300+

In Canada assisted deaths of 13,241 in 2022 made up more than 4% of all deaths.

In the Netherlands deaths by euthanasia in 2023 were 9,068, an increase of 4% on 2022. These deaths were 5% of all deaths.

In California 853 assisted deaths were recorded in 2022.

===Oregon===
In the Oregon program 2454 deaths had occurred from 2001 to 2022.

During 2022, 431 people (384 in 2021) received prescriptions for lethal doses of medications under the provisions of the Oregon DWDA, and at January 20, 2023, OHA had received reports of 278 of these people (255 in 2021) dying through ingesting those medications. 85% were aged 65 years or older, and 96% were white. The most common underlying illnesses were cancer (64%), heart disease (12%) and neurological disease (10%). 92% died at home. (See the arguments section above for reasons for using the program, and the methods section above for further information.)

In February 2016, Oregon released a report on its 2015 numbers. In 2015, there were 218 people in the state who were approved and received the lethal drugs to end their own life. Of that 218, 125 have been confirmed to have ultimately decided to ingest drugs, resulting in their death. 50 did not ingest medication and died from other means, while the ingestion status of the remaining 43 is unknown. According to the state of Oregon Public Health Division&#x27;s survey, the majority of the participants, 78%, were 65 years of age or older and predominantly white, 93.1%. 72% of the terminally ill patients who opted for ending their own lives had been diagnosed with some form of cancer. In the state of Oregon&#x27;s 2015 survey, they asked the terminally ill who were participating in medical aid in dying, what their biggest end-of-life concerns were: 96.2% of those people mentioned the loss of the ability to participate in activities that once made them enjoy life, 92.4% mentioned the loss of autonomy, or the independence of their own thoughts or actions, and 75.4% stated loss of their dignity.

A 2015 Journal of Palliative Medicine report on patterns of hospice use noted that Oregon was in both the highest quartile of hospice use and the lowest quartile of potentially concerning patterns of hospice use. A similar trend was found in Vermont, where aid-in-dying (AiD) was authorized in 2013.

A 2002 study of hospice nurses and social workers in Oregon reported that symptoms of pain, depression, anxiety, extreme air hunger and fear of the process of dying were more pronounced among hospice patients who did not request a lethal prescription for barbiturates, the drug used for physician-assisted death.

===Washington State===
An increasing trend in deaths caused by ingesting lethal doses of medications prescribed by physicians was also noted in Washington: from 64 deaths in 2009 to 202 deaths in 2015. Among the deceased, 72% had terminal cancer and 8% had neurodegenerative diseases (including ALS).

===Dignitas===
250 accompanied suicides took place under the Dignitas program in Switzerland in 2023.

==Publicized cases==
In January 2006, British doctor Anne Turner took her own life in a Zurich clinic having developed an incurable degenerative disease. Her story was reported by the BBC and later, in 2009, made into a TV film &quot;A Short Stay in Switzerland&quot; starring Julie Walters.

In July 2009, British conductor Sir Edward Downes and his wife Joan died together at a suicide clinic outside Zürich &quot;under circumstances of their own choosing&quot;. Sir Edward was not terminally ill, but his wife was diagnosed with rapidly developing cancer.

In March 2010, the American PBS TV program &quot;Frontline&quot; showed a documentary called &quot;The Suicide Tourist&quot; which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and Dignitas, and his decision to die by assisted suicide using sodium pentobarbital in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with ALS (Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease).

In June 2011, the BBC televised the assisted suicide of Peter Smedley, a canning factory owner, who was suffering from motor neurone disease. The programme – &quot;Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die&quot; – told the story of Smedley&#x27;s journey to the end where he used The Dignitas Clinic, a voluntary euthanasia clinic in Switzerland, to assist him in carrying out his suicide. The programme shows Smedley eating chocolates to counter the unpalatable taste of the liquid he drinks to end his life. Moments after drinking the liquid, Smedley begged for water, gasped for breath and became red, he then fell into a deep sleep where he snored heavily while holding his wife&#x27;s hand. Minutes later, Smedley stopped breathing and his heart stopped beating.

In Colombia in January 2022 Victor Escobar became the first person with a non-terminal illness to die by legally regulated euthanasia. The 60-year-old Escobar had end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

==Organisations active in assisted suicide==
* Death with Dignity National Center is a nonprofit US organisation active in end of life advocacy and policy reform. The organization has been advocating for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia since 1994. 
* Compassion &amp; Choices is a nonprofit US organisation active in end of life and other care issues.
* Care Not Killing is a UK organisation opposed to euthanasia.

<doc id="162617" wikidata="Q2673" url="?curid=162617" title="Chuck Norris">
<text>Carlos Ray &quot;Chuck&quot; Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist and actor. He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and judo. After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline, Chun Kuk Do. Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in martial arts. Norris went on to appear in a minor role in &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; (1968). Friend and fellow martial artist Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; (1972). While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested he take it seriously. Norris took the starring role in the action film &quot;Breaker! Breaker!&quot; (1977), which turned a profit. His second lead, &quot;Good Guys Wear Black&quot; (1978), became a hit, and he soon became a popular action film star.

Norris went on to star in a streak of bankable independently made action and martial arts films, with &quot;A Force of One&quot; (1979), &quot;The Octagon&quot; (1980), and &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot; (1981). This made Norris an international celebrity. He went on to make studio films like &quot;Silent Rage&quot; (1982) with Columbia, &quot;Forced Vengeance&quot; (1982) with MGM, and &quot;Lone Wolf McQuade&quot; (1983) with Orion. This led Cannon Films to sign Norris into a multiple film deal, starting with &quot;Missing in Action&quot; (1984), which proved to be very successful and launched a trilogy. Norris started to work almost exclusively on high-profile action films with Cannon, becoming its leading star during the 1980s. Films with Cannon include &quot;Invasion U.S.A&quot; (1985), &quot;The Delta Force&quot; (1986), and &quot;Firewalker&quot; (1986), among others. Apart from the Cannon films, Norris made &quot;Code of Silence&quot; (1985), which was received as one of his best films. In the 1990s, he played the title role in the long-running CBS television series &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; from 1993 to 2001. Until 2006, Norris continued taking lead roles in action movies. His last appearance in a major film release was in &quot;The Expendables 2&quot; (2012).

Throughout his film and TV career, Norris diversified from his regular endeavors. He is a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author, having penned books on martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christianity, Western fiction, and biographies. Norris also appeared in several commercials endorsing several products, most notably being one of the main spokespersons for the Total Gym infomercials. In 2005, Norris found new fame on the Internet when Chuck Norris facts became an Internet meme documenting humorous, fictional, and often absurd feats of strength and endurance. Although Norris himself did not produce the &quot;facts&quot;, he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated Chuck Norris facts in advertising. The phenomenon resulted in six books some of them &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers, two video games, and several appearances on talk shows, such as &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, in which he read the facts or participated in sketches.

==Early life==
Norris was born in Ryan, Oklahoma, on March 10, 1940, to Wilma (née Scarberry, 1921–2024) and Ray Dee Norris, who was a World War II Army soldier, mechanic, bus driver, and a truck driver. His mother was of Irish descent and his father of Cherokee descent. Norris was named after Carlos Berry, his father&#x27;s minister. He was the oldest of three brothers, the younger two being Wieland and Aaron. Wieland Norris informed his eldest sibling he would not reach his 27th birthday; this prediction came true in 1970 when he was killed in the Vietnam War. When Norris was 16 years old, his parents divorced, and he later relocated to Prairie Village, Kansas and then to Torrance, California with his mother and brothers.

Norris has described his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre. His father, Ray, worked intermittently as an automobile mechanic, and went on drinking binges that lasted for months at a time. Embarrassed by his father&#x27;s behavior and the family&#x27;s financial plight, Norris developed a debilitating introversion that lasted for his entire childhood.

==Career==

=== 1958 to 1969: United States Air Force and martial arts breakthrough ===
Norris joined the United States Air Force as an Air Policeman (AP) in 1958 and was sent to Osan Air Base, South Korea. It was there that Norris acquired the nickname &quot;Chuck&quot; and began his training in Tang Soo Do (tangsudo), an interest that led to black belts in that art and the founding of the Chun Kuk Do (&quot;Universal Way&quot;) form. When he returned to the United States, he continued to serve as an AP at March Air Force Base in California.

Norris was discharged from the Air Force in August 1962 with the rank of Airman first class. Following his military service, Norris applied to be a police officer in Torrance, California. While on the waiting list, Norris opened a martial arts studio.

Norris started to participate in martial arts competitions. He was defeated in his first two tournaments, dropping decisions to Joe Lewis and Allen Steen. He lost three matches at the International Karate Championships to Tony Tulleners. By 1967, Norris had improved enough that he scored victories over the likes of Vic Moore. On June 3, Norris won the 1967 tournament of karate, Norris defeated seven opponents, until his final fight with Skipper Mullins. On June 24, Norris was declared champion at the S. Henry Cho&#x27;s All-American Karate Championship at the Madison Square Garden, taking the title from Julio LaSalle and defeating Joe Lewis. During this time, Norris also worked for the Northrop Corporation and opened a chain of karate schools. Norris&#x27;s official website lists celebrity clients at the schools; among them Steve McQueen, Chad McQueen, Bob Barker, Priscilla Presley, Donny Osmond and Marie Osmond.

In early 1968, Norris suffered the tenth and final loss of his career, losing an upset decision to Louis Delgado. On November 24, 1968, he avenged his defeat to Delgado and by doing so won the Professional Middleweight Karate champion title, which he then held for six consecutive years. On April 1, Norris successfully defended his All-American Karate Championship title, in a round-robin tournament, at the Karate tournament of champions of North America. Again that year, Norris won for the second time the All-American Karate Championship. It was the last time Norris participated and retired undefeated. While competing, Norris met Bruce Lee, who at the time was known for the TV series &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. They developed a friendship, as well as a training and working relationship.

In 1969, during the first weekend of August, Norris defended his title as world champion at the International Karate Championship. The competition included champions from most of the fifty states as well as half a dozen from abroad who joined for the preliminaries. Norris retained his title and won Karate&#x27;s triple crown for the most tournament wins of the year, he also got the Fighter of the Year award by &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine. Around this time, Norris made his acting debut in the Matt Helm spy spoof &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;.

=== 1970 to 1978: Early roles and breakthrough ===
In 1972, Norris acted as Bruce Lee&#x27;s nemesis in the widely acclaimed martial arts movie &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot; (titled &quot;Return of the Dragon&quot; in its U.S. distribution). The film grossed over 5.3 million at the Hong Kong box office, beating previous records set by Lee&#x27;s own films, &quot;The Big Boss&quot; and &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, making it the highest-grossing film of 1972 in Hong Kong. &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; went on to gross an estimated US$130 million worldwide. The film is credited with launching him toward stardom.

In 1973, Norris played a role in Jonathan Kaplan&#x27;s &quot;The Student Teachers&quot;.

In 1974, actor Steve McQueen, who was his martial art student and friend at the time, saw his potential and encouraged him to begin acting classes at MGM. That same year, he played the supporting role of the main antagonist in Lo Wei&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Faced Tiger&quot;. Norris plays a powerful drug king in San Francisco, where he dominates the criminal world including the police department. He is eventually challenged by a young police officer who stands up to corruption. The film played theatrically in the United States in 1981 as &quot;Slaughter in San Francisco&quot;. It was noticed that it was an older, low-budget film announcing Norris as the lead. The film played as a double-bill to other action and genre film. It was described as a low-budget martial arts actioner taking advantage of Norris&#x27;s fame.

In 1975, Norris wrote his first book &quot;Winning Tournament Karate&quot; on the practical study of competition training for any rank. It covers all phases of executing speedy attacks, conditioning, fighting form drills, and one-step sparring techniques.

Norris&#x27;s first starring role was 1977&#x27;s &quot;Breaker! Breaker!&quot; He chose it after turning down offers to do several martial-arts films. Norris decided that he wanted to do films that had a story and where the action would take place when it is emotionally right. The low-budget film turned out to be very successful.

In 1978, Norris starred in &quot;Good Guys Wear Black.&quot; He considers it to be his first significant lead role. No studio wanted to release it, so Norris and his producers four-walled it, renting the theaters and taking whatever money came in. The film did very well; shot on a $1 million budget, it made over $18 million at the box office. Following years of kung fu film imports from Hong Kong action cinema during the 1970s, most notably Bruce Lee films followed by Bruceploitation flicks, &quot;Good Guys Wear Black&quot; launched Norris as the first successful homegrown American martial-arts star, having previously been best known as a villain in Lee&#x27;s &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot;. &quot;Good Guys Wear Black&quot; distinguished itself from earlier martial-arts films by its distinctly American setting, characters, themes, and politics, a formula that Norris continued to develop with his later films.

=== 1979 to 1983: Action film star ===
In 1979, Norris starred in &quot;A Force of One&quot;, where he played Matt Logan, a world karate champion who assists the police in their investigation. The film was developed while touring for &quot;Good Guys Wear Black&quot;. Again no studio wanted to pick it up, but it out-grossed the previous film by making $20 million at the box office.

In 1980, he released &quot;The Octagon&quot;, where his character must stop a group of terrorists trained in the ninja style. Unlike his previous films, this time the studios were interested. American Cinema Releasing distributed it and it made almost $19 million at the box office.

In 1981, he starred in Steve Carver&#x27;s &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;.

In 1982, he had the lead in the action horror film &quot;Silent Rage.&quot; It was his first film released by a major studio, Columbia Pictures. Norris plays a sheriff who must stop a psychopath on a rampage. Shortly afterward MGM gave him a three-movie deal and that same year, they released &quot;Forced Vengeance&quot; (1982). Norris was unhappy with the direction they wanted to take with him, hence the contract was canceled.

In 1983, Norris made &quot;Lone Wolf McQuade&quot; with Orion Pictures and Carver directing. He plays a reckless but brave Texas Ranger who defeats an arms dealer played by David Carradine. The film was a worldwide hit and had a positive reception from movie critics, often being compared to Sergio Leone&#x27;s stylish Spaghetti Westerns. The film became the inspiration for Norris&#x27;s future hit TV show &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a 3.5 star rating, calling the character of J.J. McQuade worthy of a film series and predicting the character would be a future classic, and it would be the first movie where Norris would wear his trademark beard. The same year, he also published an exercise called &quot;Toughen Up! the Chuck Norris Fitness System&quot;. Also in 1983, Xonox produced the video game &quot;Chuck Norris Superkicks&quot; for the Commodore 64, VIC-20, Atari 2600, and Colecovision. The game combines two types of gameplay: moving through a map, and fighting against enemies. The player takes control of Norris who has to liberate a hostage. It was later sold as &quot;Kung Fu Superkicks&quot; when the license for the use of the Chuck Norris name expired.

=== 1984 to 1988: Mainstream success ===
In 1984, Norris starred in Joseph Zito&#x27;s &quot;Missing in Action.&quot; It&#x27;s the first of a series of POW rescue fantasies, where he plays Colonel James Braddock. Produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus and released under their Cannon Films banner, with which he had signed a multiple movie deal. Norris later dedicated these films to his younger brother Wieland, who was a private in the 101st Airborne Division, and had been killed in June 1970 in Vietnam while on patrol in the defense of Firebase Ripcord. The film was a huge success, and Norris became Cannon&#x27;s most prominent star of the 1980s.

&quot;Missing in Action 2: The Beginning&quot; premiered on March 1, 1985. It is a prequel to the first installment, about Braddock being held in a North Vietnamese POW camp. Orion Pictures released &quot;Code of Silence&quot; on May 3. It received positive reviews and was also a box-office success. &quot;Code of Silence&quot; is a crime drama, and features Norris as a streetwise plainclothes officer who takes down a crime czar. &quot;Invasion U.S.A.&quot; premiered on September 27, with Zito directing.
On February 14, 1986, Menahem Golan&#x27;s &quot;The Delta Force&quot; premiered. Norris co-stars with Lee Marvin. They play leaders of an elite squad of Special Forces troops who face a group of terrorists. &quot;The Delta Force&quot; was a box office success. In October, Ruby-Spears&#x27; cartoon &quot;Karate Kommandos&quot; first aired. The animated show lasted six episodes. In it, Norris voices a cartoon version of himself who leads a United States government team of operatives known as the Karate Kommandos. Marvel made a comic book adaptation. 

On November 21, J. Lee Thompson&#x27;s action-adventure comedy film &quot;Firewalker&quot; premiered, where Norris co-lead with Louis Gossett Jr.. Gossett and Norris play two seasoned treasure hunters whose adventures rarely result in any notable success. Norris explained that the project came about when he wanted to show a lighter side of himself. Gossett appreciated Norris efforts and said &quot;I have great respect for what actors call stretch. Chuck had to open up first to allow this atmosphere. It has to do with his desire to stretch. Someone else could have been quite insecure. He chose to open up. He&#x27;s studying hard and he&#x27;s serious.&quot; The review were mostly negative, while some thought it was a fine for a light action film. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; enjoyed it of the cast he said they &quot;really get into the light-hearted spirit of the occasion.&quot; The film made $11,834,302 at the box-office.

In 1987, he published the New York Times Best Seller &quot;The Secret of Inner Strength: My Story&quot;. It is about his self-improvement philosophy.

On January 2, 1988, &quot;&quot; premiered, Norris returned to the title role and his brother Aaron Norris directed. On August 28, Norris starred in &quot;Hero and the Terror&quot; directed by William Tannen. In it Norris stars as a cop investigating a serial killer.

=== 1989 to 1999: Subsequent success ===
By 1990, his films had collectively grossed over $500 million worldwide . By this time, he had drawn comparisons to both Bruce Lee and Clint Eastwood, sometimes called the &quot;blonde Bruce Lee&quot; for his martial arts film roles while his &quot;loner&quot; persona was compared to the Eastwood character Dirty Harry. That same year, MGM acquired the Cannon Films library. Norris continued making films with Aaron, who directed him in &quot;Delta Force 2&quot;, &quot;The Hitman,&quot; &quot;Sidekicks&quot; (1993), &quot;Hellbound&quot; (1994), &quot;Top Dog&quot; (1995), and &quot;Forest Warrior&quot; (1996).

In 1993, he began shooting the action series &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;. The television show is centered on Sergeant Cordell Walker (Norris), a member of the Texas Rangers, a state-level bureau of investigation, and is about his adventures fighting criminals with his partner James Trivette. It lasted eight seasons on CBS and continued in syndication on other channels, notably the Hallmark Channel. The show was very successful in the ratings throughout its run, ranking among the Top 30 programs from 1995 until 1999, and ranking in the Top 20 in both the 1995–1996 and 1998–1999 seasons. In 1999, Norris produced and played Walker in a supporting role in the &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; spin-off &quot;Sons of Thunder&quot;. The same year, also playing the role of Walker, Norris acted in a crossover episode of the Sammo Hung&#x27;s TV show &quot;Martial Law&quot;. For another crossover, Hung also appeared as his character in &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;.

Separately from &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger,&quot; on August 25, 1993, the Randy Travis television special &quot;Wind in the Wire&quot; first aired. Norris was among the guests. At the 1994 edition of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF)&#x27;s Survivor Series event, Norris was the special outside enforcer for the Casket Match between The Undertaker and Yokozuna. During the match, Norris delivered a roundhouse kick to an interfering Jeff Jarrett. In 1996, Norris wrote the book &quot;The Secret Power Within: Zen Solutions to Real Problems&quot;. Since 1997, Norris has appeared with Christie Brinkley in a long-running series of cable TV infomercials promoting Total Gym home fitness equipment. On November 1, 1998, CBS premiered Michael Preece&#x27;s television film &quot;Logan&#x27;s War: Bound by Honor,&quot; starring Norris and Eddie Cibrian. The television film was ranked third among the thirteen most viewed shows of that week.

=== 2000 to 2005: Subsequent films and internet fame ===
In the early 2000s, Norris starred as a secret agent in the CBS television films &quot;The President&#x27;s Man&quot; (2000) and &quot;The President&#x27;s Man: A Line in the Sand&quot;.(2002).

In 2003, Norris played a role in the supernatural Christian film &quot;Bells of Innocence.&quot; That same year, he acted in one episode of the TV show &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;.

In 2004, Rawson Marshall Thurber&#x27;s comedy film &quot;&quot; was released. Norris plays himself as a judge during a dodgeball game. Described by critics as &quot;a raunchy comedy that delivers for many&quot;, it grossed $167.7 million.

That same year, he published his autobiography &quot;Against All Odds: My Story&quot;.

In 2005, Norris founded the World Combat League (WCL), a full-contact, team-based martial arts competition, of which part of the proceeds are given to his Kickstart Kids program.

On October 17, 2005, CBS premiered the Sunday Night Movie of the Week &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire&quot;. The production was a continuation of the series, and not scripted to be a reunion movie. Norris reprised his role as Walker for the movie. He has stated that future &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; Movie of the Week projects are expected; however, this was severely impaired by CBS&#x27;s 2006–2007 season decision to no longer regularly schedule Movies of the Week on Sunday night.
Chuck Norris facts originally started appearing on the Internet in early 2005. Created by Ian Spector, they are satirical factoids about Norris. Since then, they have become widespread in popular culture. The &quot;facts&quot; are normally absurd hyperbolic claims about Norris&#x27;s toughness, attitude, virility, sophistication, and masculinity. Norris has written his own response to the parody on his website, stating that he does not feel offended by them and finds some of them funny, claiming that his personal favorite is that they wanted to add his face to Mount Rushmore, but the granite is not hard enough for his beard. At first it was mostly college students exchanging them, but they later became extremely widespread.

From that point on, Norris started to tour with the Chuck Norris facts appearing on major talk shows, and even visiting troops in Iraq for morale boosting appearances.

=== 2006–present: Current works ===
Norris starred in the film &quot;The Cutter&quot; in 2006, where he plays a detective on a rescue mission. That year time he published the novel &quot;The Justice Riders&quot;, co-written with Ken Abraham, Aaron Norris, and Tim Grayem.

Gotham Books, the adult division of Penguin USA, released a book penned by Ian Spector entitled &quot;The Truth About Chuck Norris: 400 facts about the World&#x27;s Greatest Human&quot;. Norris subsequently filed suit in December against Penguin USA claiming &quot;trademark infringement, unjust enrichment and privacy rights&quot;. Norris dropped the lawsuit in 2008. The book is a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. Since then, Spector has published four more books based on Chuck Norris facts, these are &quot;Chuck Norris Cannot Be Stopped: 400 All-New Facts About the Man Who Knows Neither Fear Nor Mercy&quot;, &quot;Chuck Norris: Longer and Harder: The Complete Chronicle of the World&#x27;s Deadliest, Sexiest, and Beardiest Man&quot;, &quot;The Last Stand of Chuck Norris: 400 All New Facts About the Most Terrifying Man in the Universe&quot;, and &quot;Chuck Norris Vs. Mr. T: 400 Facts About the Baddest Dudes in the History of Ever&quot; (also a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller). That year Norris with the same team published a sequel to &quot;The Justice Riders&quot; called &quot;A Threat to Justice&quot;. Tyndale House Publishers also published a book praising Norris, entitled &quot;The Official Chuck Norris Fact Book: 101 of Chuck&#x27;s Favorite Facts and Stories&quot;, which was co-written and officially endorsed by him.

In 2008, he published the political non-fiction book &quot;Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America&quot;, which reached number 14 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best seller list in September 2008. That same year, Gameloft produced the video game &quot;Chuck Norris: Bring On the Pain&quot; for mobile devices, based on the popularity Norris had developed on the internet with the Chuck Norris facts. The player takes control of Norris in a side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up. The game was well reviewed.

Since 2010, Norris has been a nationally syndicated columnist with Creators Syndicate writing on both personal health issues and broader issues of health care in America.

Throughout the 2010s, Norris appeared in advertisements for T-Mobile, World of Warcraft, BZ WBK, the French TV show &quot;Pieds dans le plat&quot;, Hoegaarden, United Healthcare, Hesburger, Cerveza Poker, Toyota, and in the 2020s, QuikTrip.

In 2012, Norris played a mercenary in &quot;The Expendables 2&quot;. The film was a success and grossed over $310 million worldwide. That same year, Norris and his wife Gena founded CForce Bottling Co. after an aquifer was discovered on his ranch.

In 2017, Norris became Fiat&#x27;s ambassador, a &quot;tough face&quot; for its commercial vehicles. Flaregames produced &quot;Non Stop Chuck Norris&quot;, an isometric action-RPG game for mobile devices and is the second game to be based on his popularity developed by the Chuck Norris facts. The game was well-reviewed.

In 2019, Norris hosted the documentary &quot;Chuck Norris’ Epic Guide to Military Vehicles&quot; on the History Channel. In it, Norris explores vehicular creations by the US military. In 2020, Norris acted in the series finale of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. In 2021, Norris was featured as a character in the video game &quot;World of Tanks&quot; during a holiday event.

==Martial arts knowledge==
Norris has founded two major martial arts systems: American Tang Soo Do and Chuck Norris System (formerly known as Chun Kuk Do).

===American Tang Soo Do===

American Tang Soo Do was formed in 1966 by Norris, which is combination of Moo Duk Kwan-style Tang Soo Do, Judo and Karate (Shito-Ryu and Shotokan). Over the years it has been further developed by former black belts of his and their students.

===Chuck Norris System===
Norris&#x27;s present martial art system is the Chuck Norris System, formerly known as Chun Kuk Do.

The style was formally founded in 1990 as Chun Kuk Do by Norris, and was originally based on Norris&#x27;s Tang Soo Do training in Korea while he was in the military.

During his competitive fighting career, Norris began to evolve the style to make it more effective and well-rounded by studying other systems such as Shōtōkan, Gōjū-ryū, Shitō-ryū, Enshin kaikan, Kyokushin, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Arnis, Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Hapkido and American Kenpo. Chun Kuk Do now emphasizes self defense, competition, weapons, grappling, and fitness, among other things. Each summer the United Fighting Arts Federation (UFAF) holds a training conference and the Chun Kuk Do world championship tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The art includes a code of honor and rules to live by. These rules are from Norris&#x27;s personal code. They are:

# I will develop myself to the maximum of my potential in all ways.
# I will forget the mistakes of the past and press on to greater achievements.
# I will continually work at developing love, happiness and loyalty in my family.
# I will look for the good in all people and make them feel worthwhile.
# If I have nothing good to say about a person, I will say nothing.
# I will always be as enthusiastic about the success of others as I am about my own.
# I will maintain an attitude of open-mindedness.
# I will maintain respect for those in authority and demonstrate this respect at all times.
# I will always remain loyal to my God, my country, family and my friends.
# I will remain highly goal-oriented throughout my life because that positive attitude helps my family, my country and myself.

Like most traditional martial arts, Chuck Norris System includes the practice of forms (Korean &quot;hyung&quot; and Japanese &quot;kata&quot;). The majority of the system&#x27;s forms are adapted from Korean Tang Soo Do, and Taekwondo, Japanese Shitō-ryū, Shotokan Karate, Goju-ryu, Kyokushinkai Karate, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, American Kenpo. It includes two organization-specific introductory forms, two organization-specific empty-hand forms, and one organization-specific weapon form (UFAF Nunchuk form, UFAF Bo form, UFAF Sai forms).

The United Fighting Arts Federation has graduated over 3,000 black belts in its history, and currently has nearly 4,000 active members world-wide. There are about 90 member schools in the US, Mexico, Norway, and Paraguay.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Norris married his classmate Dianne Kay Holechek (born 1941) in December 1958 when he was 18 and Dianne was 17 years of age. They had met in 1956 at high school in Torrance, California. In 1962, their first child, Mike, was born. He also had a daughter in 1963 out of an extramarital affair. Later, he had a second son, Eric, with his wife in 1964. After 30 years of marriage, Norris and Holechek were divorced in 1989, after separating in 1988 during the filming of &quot;The Delta Force 2&quot;.

On November 28, 1998, he married former model Gena O&#x27;Kelley, 23 years younger than Norris. O&#x27;Kelley had two children from a previous marriage. She delivered twins on August 30, 2001.

On September 22, 2004, Norris told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;&#x27;s Mary Hart that he did not meet his illegitimate daughter from a past relationship until she was 26, although she learned that he was her father when she was 16. He met her after she sent a letter informing him of their relationship in 1990, one year after Norris&#x27;s divorce from his first wife, Dianne Holechek.

Norris has 13 grandchildren .

===Christianity===
An outspoken Christian, Norris is the author of several Christian-themed books. On April 22, 2008, Norris expressed his support for the intelligent design movement when he reviewed Ben Stein&#x27;s &quot;&quot; for Townhall.com.

He is Baptist and a member of the Prestonwood Baptist Church (Southern Baptist Convention) in Dallas.

===Political views===

Norris is a Republican and outspoken conservative. Norris is a columnist for the far-right WorldNetDaily.

In an interview following the release of the 1984 film &quot;Missing in Action&quot;, Norris stated that &quot;I am a conservative, a real flag waver, a big Ronald Reagan fan. I&#x27;m not so much a Republican or Democrat; I go more for the man himself. Ronald Reagan says what he thinks, he&#x27;s not afraid to speak his mind, even if he may be unpopular. I want a strong leader and he is a strong leader. And ever since he has been in office there has been a more positive, patriotic feeling in this country.&quot;

Around the time of the filming of the 1986 film &quot;The Delta Force&quot;, Norris said—in response to the hijacking of TWA flight 847—that United States is becoming a &quot;paper tiger&quot; in the Middle East. &quot;What we&#x27;re facing here is the fact that our passive approach to terrorism is going to instigate much more terrorism throughout the world.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve been all over the world, and seeing the devastation that terrorism has done in Europe and the Middle East, I know eventually it&#x27;s going to come here,&quot; added Norris. &quot;It&#x27;s just a matter of time. They&#x27;re doing all this devastation in Europe now, and the next stepping stone is America and Canada. Being a free country, with the freedom of movement that we have, it&#x27;s an open door policy for terrorism. It&#x27;s like Khadafy [sic] said a few weeks ago. &#x27;If Reagan doesn&#x27;t back off, I&#x27;m going to release my killer squads in America.&#x27; And there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that he has them.&quot;

In 2007, Norris took a trip to Iraq to visit U.S. troops.

Norris supported Mike Huckabee&#x27;s failed candidacy in the 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries, where he made headlines for calling the eventual Republican nominee, John McCain, too old to handle the pressures of being president. He voiced his support for McCain in the 2008 presidential election, emphasizing his enthusiasm for McCain&#x27;s partner on the Republican ticket, Sarah Palin.

On November 18, 2008, Norris became one of the first members of show business to express support for the California Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage, and he criticized activists for not accepting the democratic process and the apparent double standard he perceived in criticizing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints without criticizing African Americans, most of whom who had voted for the measure.

In 2009, Norris had expressed support for the Barack Obama &quot;birther&quot; conspiracy. In his letter, released at WorldNetDaily, Norris deemed then-President Obama&#x27;s refusal to disclose his birth certificate suspicious and implored him to put an end to the conspiracy theories.

On April 11, 2011 Norris had written a five-part investigation regarding the &quot;infiltration of Sharia law into United States culture&quot; for WorldNetDaily.

On June 26, 2012, Norris published an article on Ammoland.com, in which he accused the Obama administration of paying Jim Turley, one of the national board members of the Boy Scouts of America at the time, to reverse the organization&#x27;s policy that excluded gay youths from joining.

During the 2012 presidential election, Norris first recommended Ron Paul, and then later formally endorsed Newt Gingrich as the Republican presidential candidate. After Gingrich suspended his campaign in May 2012, Norris endorsed Republican presumptive nominee Mitt Romney, despite Norris having previously accused Romney of flip-flopping and of trying to buy the nomination for the Republican Party candidacy for 2012. On the eve of the election, he and his wife Gena made a video warning that if evangelicals did not show up at the polls and vote out President Obama, &quot;...our country as we know it may be lost forever...&quot;.

Norris has visited Israel, and he voiced support for former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the 2013 and 2015 elections. Norris endorsed Huckabee again in the 2016 Republican primaries before he dropped out. In March 2016, it was reported that Norris endorsed Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz and that he would be attending a Cruz rally, but two days later, Norris stated he would only endorse the GOP nominee once that nominee has been nominated by the party. Later, Norris endorsed former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in the 2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama.

In 2019, Norris signed an endorsement deal with gun manufacturer Glock. The deal was met with criticism from some members of the public and some of his fans, who felt it was in bad timing due to the increase in school shootings in the United States.

In 2021, Norris announced his support of the 2021 gubernatorial election to recall incumbent Governor Gavin Newsom and endorsed radio talk show host Larry Elder to replace him.

==Philanthropy==
In 1990, Norris established the United Fighting Arts Federation and Kickstart Kids. As a significant part of his philanthropic contributions, the organization was formed to develop self-esteem and focus in at-risk children as a tactic to keep them away from drug-related pressure by training them in martial arts. Norris hopes that by shifting middle school and high school children&#x27;s focus towards this positive and strengthening endeavor, these children will have the opportunity to build a better future for themselves. Norris has a ranch in Navasota, Texas, where they bottle water; a portion of the sales support environmental funds and Kickstart Kids.

He is known for his contributions towards organizations such as Funds for Kids, Veteran&#x27;s Administration National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, the United Way, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation in the form of donations as well as fund-raising activities.

His time with the U.S. Veterans Administration as a spokesperson was inspired by his experience serving the United States Air Force in Korea. His objective has been to popularize the issues that concern hospitalized war veterans such as pensions and health care. Due to his significant contributions, and continued support, he received the &quot;Veteran of the Year&quot; award in 2001 at the &quot;American Veteran Awards&quot;.

In India, Norris supports the Vijay Amritraj Foundation, which aims to help victims of disease, tragedy and circumstance.

<doc id="162619" wikidata="Q20773771" url="?curid=162619" title="Apprenticeship">
<text>Apprenticeship is a system for training a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some accompanying study (classroom work and reading). Apprenticeships may also enable practitioners to gain a license to practice in a regulated occupation. Most of their training is done while working for an employer who helps the apprentices learn their trade or profession, in exchange for their continued labor for an agreed period after they have achieved measurable competencies.

Apprenticeship lengths vary significantly across sectors, professions, roles and cultures. In some cases, people who successfully complete an apprenticeship can reach the &quot;journeyman&quot; or professional certification level of competence. In other cases, they can be offered a permanent job at the company that provided the placement. Although the formal boundaries and terminology of the apprentice/journeyman/master system often do not extend outside guilds and trade unions, the concept of on-the-job training leading to competence over a period of years is found in any field of skilled labor.
==Alternative terminology==

There is no global consensus on a single term for apprenticeship. Depending on the culture, country and sector, the same or similar definitions are used to describe the terms &quot;apprenticeship&quot;, &quot;internship&quot;, and &quot;trainee-ship&quot;. The latter two terms may be preferred in the health sector. One example is &quot;internships in medicine&quot; for physicians and &quot;trainee-ships&quot; for nurses – and western countries. &quot;Apprenticeship&quot; is the preferred term of the European Commission and the one selected for use by the European Center for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP), which has developed many studies on the subject. Some non-European countries adapt European apprenticeship practices.

==History==
The system of apprenticeship first developed in the Late Middle Ages and came to be supervised by craft guilds and town governments. A master craftsman was entitled to employ young people as an inexpensive form of labour in exchange for providing food, lodging and formal training in the craft. Most apprentices were males, but female apprentices were found in crafts such as seamstress, tailor, cordwainer, baker and stationer. Apprentices usually began at ten to fifteen years of age, and would live in the master craftsman&#x27;s household. The contract between the craftsman, the apprentice and, generally, the apprentice&#x27;s parents would often be governed by an indenture. Most apprentices aspired to becoming master craftsmen themselves on completion of their contract (usually a term of seven years), but some would spend time as a journeyman and a significant proportion would never acquire their own workshop. In Coventry those completing seven-year apprenticeships with stuff merchants were entitled to become freemen of the city.

Apprenticeship was adopted into military of the West African kingdom of Dahomey. Soldiers in the army were recruited as young as seven or eight years old, as they initially served as shield carriers for regular soldiers. After years of apprenticeship and military experience, the recruits were allowed to join the army as regular soldiers. With a combination of lifelong military experience and monetary incentives, a cohesive and well-disciplined military emerged in Dahomey.

==Types of apprenticeships==

Apprenticeships can be divided into two main categories: Independent and Cooperative.

Independent apprenticeships are those organized and managed by employers, without any involvement from educational institutions. They happen dissociated from any educational curricula, which means that, usually, the apprentices are not involved in any educational programme at the same time but, even if they are, there is no relation between the undergoing studies and the apprenticeship.

Cooperative apprenticeships are those organized and managed in cooperation between educational institutions and employers. They vary in terms of governance, some being more employer lead and others more educational institution lead, but they are always associated with a curriculum and are designed as a mean for students to put theory in practice and master knowledge in a way that empowers them with professional autonomy. Their main characteristics could be summarized into the following:
== Apprenticeship systems worldwide==
===Australia===
Australian Apprenticeships encompass all apprenticeships and traineeships. They cover all industry sectors in Australia and are used to achieve both &#x27;entry-level&#x27; and career &#x27;upskilling&#x27; objectives. There were 475,000 Australian Apprentices in-training as at 31 March 2012, an increase of 2.4% from the previous year. Australian Government employer and employee incentives may be applicable, while State and Territory Governments may provide public funding support for the training element of the initiative. Australian Apprenticeships combine time at work with formal training and can be full-time, part-time or school-based.

Australian apprentice and traineeship services are dedicated to promoting retention, therefore much effort is made to match applicants with the right apprenticeship or traineeship. This is done with the aid of aptitude tests, tips, and information on &#x27;how to retain an apprentice or apprenticeship&#x27;.

Information and resources on potential apprenticeship and traineeship occupations are available in over sixty industries.

The distinction between the terms apprentices and trainees lies mainly around traditional trades and the time it takes to gain a qualification. The Australian government uses Australian Apprenticeships Centres to administer and facilitate Australian Apprenticeships so that funding can be disseminated to eligible businesses, apprentices and trainees, supporting the whole process as it underpins the future skills of Australian industry. Australia also has a fairly unusual safety net in place for businesses and Australian Apprentices with its Group Training scheme. This is where businesses that are not able to employ the Australian Apprentice for the full period until they qualify, are able to lease or hire the Australian Apprentice from a Group Training Organisation. It is a safety net, because the Group Training Organisation is the employer and provides continuity of employment and training for the Australian Apprentice.

In addition to a safety net, Group Training Organisations (GTO) have other benefits such as additional support for both the Host employer and the trainee/apprentice through an industry consultant who visits regularly to make sure that the trainee/apprentice are fulfilling their work and training obligations with their Host employer. There is the additional benefit of the trainee/apprentice being employed by the GTO reducing the Payroll/Superannuation and other legislative requirements on the Host employer who pays as invoiced per agreement.

===Austria===
Apprenticeship training in Austria is organized in a school system with long-term training parts. It is thus possible to get the Matura needed to enter university. WIFI company-based training of apprentices is complemented by compulsory attendance of a part-time vocational school for apprentices (Berufsschule). It lasts two to four years – the duration varies among the 250 legally recognized apprenticeship trades.

About 40 percent of all Austrian teenagers enter apprenticeship training upon completion of compulsory education (at age 15). This number has been stable since the 1950s.

The five most popular trades are: Retail Salesperson (5,000 people complete this apprenticeship per year), Clerk (3,500 / year), Car Mechanic (2,000 / year), Hairdresser (1,700 / year), Cook (1,600 / year). There are many smaller trades with small numbers of apprentices, e.g. &quot;EDV-Systemtechniker&quot; (Sysadmin), which is completed by fewer than 100 people a year.

The Apprenticeship Leave Certificate provides the apprentice with access to two different vocational careers. On the one hand, it is a prerequisite for the admission to the Master Craftsman Exam and for qualification tests, and on the other hand it gives access to higher education via the TVE-Exam or the Higher Education Entrance Exam which are prerequisites for taking up studies at colleges, universities, &quot;Fachhochschulen&quot;, post-secondary courses and post-secondary colleges.

The person responsible for overseeing the training inside the company is called &quot;Lehrherr&quot; or &quot;Ausbilder&quot;. An Ausbilder must prove that he has the professional qualifications needed to educate another person, has no criminal record and is an otherwise-respectable person. The law states that &quot;the person wanting to educate a young apprentice must prove that he has an ethical way of living and the civic qualities of a good citizen&quot;.

===Canada===


In Canada, apprenticeships tend to be formalized for craft trades and technician level qualifications. At the completion of the provincial exam, they may write the Provincial Standard exam. British Columbia is one province that uses these exams as the provincial exam. This means a qualification for the province will satisfy the whole country. The inter-provincial exam questions are agreed upon by all provinces of the time. At the time there were only four provinces, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Upper Canada (now Ontario), and Lower Canada (now Quebec).

In Canada, each province has its own apprenticeship program, which may be the only route into jobs within compulsory trades.

Organisations such as the Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship and Employment and Social Development Canada help to oversee the programmes.

===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic, the term &quot;vocational school&quot; (učiliště) can refer to the two, three or four years of secondary practical education. Apprenticeship Training is implemented under Education Act (školský zákon). Apprentices spend about 30–60% of their time in companies (sociální partneři školy) and the rest in formal education. Depending on the profession, they may work for two to three days a week in the company and then spend two or three days at a vocational school.

===France===
In France, apprenticeships also developed between the ninth and thirteenth centuries, with guilds structured around apprentices, journeymen and master craftsmen, continuing in this way until 1791, when the guilds were suppressed.

The first laws regarding apprenticeships were passed in 1851. From 1919, young people had to take 150 hours of theory and general lessons in their subject a year. This minimum training time rose to 360 hours a year in 1961, then 400 in 1986.

The first training centres for apprentices (&quot;centres de formation d&#x27;apprentis&quot;, CFAs) appeared in 1961, and in 1971 apprenticeships were legally made part of professional training. In 1986 the age limit for beginning an apprenticeship was raised from 20 to 25. From 1987 the range of qualifications achievable through an apprenticeship was widened to include the &quot;brevet professionnel&quot; (certificate of vocational aptitude), the &quot;bac professionnel&quot; (vocational baccalaureate diploma), the &quot;brevet de technicien supérieur&quot; (advanced technician&#x27;s certificate), engineering diplomas, master&#x27;s degree and more.

On January 18, 2005, President Jacques Chirac announced the introduction of a law on a programme for social cohesion comprising the three pillars of employment, housing and equal opportunities. The French government pledged to further develop apprenticeship as a path to success at school and to employment, based on its success: in 2005, 80% of young French people who had completed an apprenticeship entered employment. In France, the term apprenticeship often denotes manual labor but it also includes other jobs like secretary, manager, engineer, shop assistant... The plan aimed to raise the number of apprentices from 365,000 in 2005 to 500,000 in 2009. To achieve this aim, the government is, for example, granting tax relief for companies when they take on apprentices. (Since 1925 a tax has been levied to pay for apprenticeships.) The minister in charge of the campaign, Jean-Louis Borloo, also hoped to improve the image of apprenticeships with an information campaign, as they are often connected with academic failure at school and an ability to grasp only practical skills and not theory. After the civil unrest end of 2005, the government, led by prime minister Dominique de Villepin, announced a new law. Dubbed &quot;law on equality of chances&quot;, it created the First Employment Contract as well as manual apprenticeship from as early as 14 years of age. From this age, students are allowed to quit the compulsory school system in order to quickly learn a vocation. This measure has long been a policy of conservative French political parties, and was met by tough opposition from trade unions and students.

===Germany===


Apprenticeships are part of Germany&#x27;s dual education system, which combines a practical education in a company and a theoretical one in a vocational school. The lessons in vocational school can either happen once or twice a week, or in whole week blocks. During their apprenticeship, apprentices can earn a salary, which gets higher every year, with the average apprentice earning 1,066€ before taxes. The average apprenticeship takes between 2 and 3.5 years. As of 2024, there are 327 officially recognized apprenticeship trades.

===India===
In India, the Apprentices Act was enacted in 1961. It regulates the programme of training of apprentices in the industry so as to conform to the syllabi, period of training etc. as laid down by the Central Apprenticeship Council and to utilise fully the facilities available in industry for imparting practical training with a view to meeting the requirements of skilled manpower for industry.

The Apprentices Act enacted in 1961 and was implemented effectively in 1962. Initially, the Act envisaged training of trade apprentices. The Act was amended in 1973 to include training of graduate and diploma engineers as &quot;Graduate&quot; &amp; &quot;Technician&quot; Apprentices. The Act was further amended in 1986 to bring within its purview the training of the 10+2 vocational stream as &quot;Technician (Vocational)&quot; Apprentices.

====Responsibility of implementing Apprentices Act====
Overall responsibility is with the Directorate General of Employment &amp; Training (DGE&amp;T) in the Union Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.

* For Trades Apprentices (ITI-Passed/Fresher): DGE&amp;T is also responsible for implementation of the Act in respect of Trade Apprentices in the Central Govt. Undertakings &amp; Departments. This is done through six Regional Directorates of Apprenticeship Training located at Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kanpur and Faridabad. While State Apprenticeship Advisers are responsible for implementation of the Act in respect of Trade Apprentices in State Government Undertakings/ Departments and Private Establishments.
* For Graduate, Technician (Polytechnic Diploma holder) and Technician (H.S Vocational-Passed) Apprentices: Department of Education in the Ministry of Human Resource Development is responsible for implementation of the through four Boards of Apprenticeship Training located at Chennai, Kanpur, Kolkata and Mumbai.

===Ireland===
In Ireland the apprenticeships are split into two main categories: &quot;craft&quot; and &quot;new&quot;. The main craft trades and professions have been designated by SOLAS and come within the scope of the Statutory Apprenticeship system, which is organised by SOLAS in co-operation with the Department of Education, employers and unions. An Apprenticeship Council is also in place. An apprenticeship provides on-the-job training with an employer. It usually alternates between off-the-job training in an education centre and on-the-job training at an employer&#x27;s workplace. An apprenticeship generally lasts for 4 years, during which time there are 3 different periods in off-the-job training. This training phase takes place in an Education and Training Board (ETB) Training Centre while the subsequent off-the-job training phases take place in an Institute of Technology. After on-going assessments through on-the-job competence testing as well as off-the-job modular assessments and examinations, if passed successfully the apprentice is awarded an Advanced Certificate in craft (level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications).

New apprenticeships in other areas of industry were introduced from 2016, and can lead to an award between Levels 5–10 on the National Framework of Qualifications. Each apprenticeship programme lasts between 2 and 4 years. Industry-led groups which work with education and training providers and other partners, oversee the development and roll-out of new apprenticeships. New apprenticeships in ICT, finance and hospitality include software development, accounting technician and commis chef.

===Liberia===
In Liberia, tailor apprenticeships engage with more skilled tailors to learn the craft and the skills that may be taught in more traditional school settings. They learn from master tailors, which gives the apprentices a promised job once their training is completed. 
Apprentices must have a grasp on patterns, measurement, and other mathematics skills. They demonstrate full concept mastery before moving on to the next piece of clothing. Instead of formal testing for evaluation, articles of clothing must meet the quality standards before they can be sold and before the apprentice can begin a new design.

===Nigeria===
The Igbo apprentice system is a framework of formal and informal indentured agreements between parties that ultimately facilitate burgeoning entrepreneurial communities within the Igbos. It is an economic model practiced widely by Igbos and originated in South-Eastern Nigeria. Its purposes were and still remains to spur economic growth and stability, and sustainable livelihood by financing and investing in human resources through vocational training.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, the Apprenticeship Training is implemented under the National Apprenticeship Ordinance 1962 and Apprenticeship Rules 1966, regulating programs across industries in conjunction with Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutes. For companies with over fifty workers in apprenticeable trades, it&#x27;s mandatory to conduct apprenticeship training. All costs, including wages, are covered by the industry. Enforcement is carried out by provincial governments through various TEVTAs, such as Punjab TEVTA, Sindh TEVTA, KP TEVTA, Balochistan TEVTA, and AJK TEVTA.

The training period varies by trade, from 1 to 4 years. As of 2015, more than 30,000 apprentices were being trained in 2,751 industries across 276 trades. This accounts for less than 10% of the over 350,000 institution-based vocational trainees produced annually.

In recent years, the Government of Pakistan, through the National Vocational &amp; Technical Training Commission, has begun reforms to modernize the apprenticeship system. Key aspects include:

* Expansion into services, agriculture, and mining sectors
* Cost-sharing between the industry and government
* Formalization of informal apprenticeships
* Alignment with the National Vocational Qualifications Framework (Pakistan NVQF)
* Increased female participation
* Financial incentives for industries exceeding apprentice requirements
* Joint assessment and certification by the industry, Chamber of Commerce, and government

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, after the end of compulsory schooling, two thirds of young people follow a vocational training. Ninety percent of them are in the dual education system.

Switzerland has an apprenticeship similarly to Germany and Austria. The educational system is ternar, which is basically dual education system with mandatory practical courses. The length of an apprenticeship can be 2, 3 or 4 years.

====Length====
Apprenticeships with a length of 2 years are for persons with weaker school results. The certificate awarded after successfully completing a 2-year apprenticeship is called &quot;Attestation de formation professionnelle&quot; () in French, &quot;Eidgenössisches Berufsattest&quot; () in German and &quot;Certificato federale di formazione pratica&quot; (CFP) in Italian. It could be translated as &quot;Attestation of professional formation&quot;.

Apprenticeship with a length of 3 or 4 years are the most common ones. The certificate awarded after successfully completing a 3 or 4-year apprenticeship is called &quot;Certificat Fédéral de Capacité&quot; () in French, &quot;Eidgenössisches Fähigkeitszeugnis&quot; () in German and &quot;Attestato federale di capacità&quot; (AFC) in Italian. It could be translated as &quot;Federal Certificate of Proficiency&quot;.

Some crafts, such as electrician, are educated in lengths of 3 and 4 years. In this case, an Electrician with 4 years apprenticeship gets more theoretical background than one with 3 years apprenticeship. Some languages have different names for a craft depending on the length of the apprenticeship; this can be lost in translation.

Each of the over 300 nationwide defined vocational profiles has defined framework – conditions as length of education, theoretical and practical learning goals and certification conditions.

====Age of the apprentices====
Typically an apprenticeship can commence for individuals once they are aged 15 or 18 after finishing general education. Some apprenticeships have a recommend or required age of 18. There is formally no maximum age, however, for persons above 21 it is hard to find a company due to companies preferring younger ages due to the lower cost of labour.

===Turkey===
In Turkey, apprenticeship has been part of the small business culture for centuries since the time of Seljuk Turks who claimed Anatolia as their homeland in the 11th century.

There are three levels of apprenticeship. The first level is the apprentice, i.e., the &quot;çırak&quot; in Turkish. The second level is pre-master which is called, &quot;kalfa&quot; in Turkish. The mastery level is called as &quot;usta&quot; and is the highest level of achievement. An &#x27;usta&#x27; is eligible to take in and accept new &#x27;ciraks&#x27; to train and bring them up. The training process usually starts when the small boy is of age 10–11 and becomes a full-grown master at the age of 20–25. Many years of hard work and disciplining under the authority of the master is the key to the young apprentice&#x27;s education and learning process.

In Turkey today there are many vocational schools that train children to gain skills to learn a new profession. The student after graduation looks for a job at the nearest local marketplace usually under the authority of a master.

===United Kingdom===
Apprenticeships in the United Kingdom are devolved. It has a long tradition in the United Kingdom, dating back to around the 12th century. Apprenticeships flourished in the 14th century and were expanded during the Industrial Revolution. In modern times, apprenticeships were formalised in 1964 by act of parliament and they continue to be in widespread use in all four nations, with hundreds of apprenticeships to choose from.

===United States===
Apprenticeship programs in the United States are regulated by the Smith–Hughes Act (1917), The National Industrial Recovery Act (1933), and National Apprenticeship Act, also known as the &quot;Fitzgerald Act.&quot;

The number of American apprentices has increased from 375,000 in 2014 to 500,000 in 2016, while the federal government intends to see 750,000 by 2019, particularly by expanding the apprenticeship model to include white-collar occupations such as information technology.

==Analogues at universities and professional development==
The modern concept of an internship is similar to an apprenticeship but not as rigorous. Universities still use apprenticeship schemes in their production of scholars: bachelors are promoted to masters and then produce a thesis under the oversight of a supervisor before the corporate body of the university recognises the achievement of the standard of a doctorate. Another view of this system is of graduate students in the role of apprentices, post-doctoral fellows as journeymen, and professors as masters . In the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; Adam Smith states that: Seven years seem anciently to have been, all over Europe, the usual term established for the duration of apprenticeships in the greater part of incorporated trades. All such incorporations were anciently called universities, which indeed is the proper Latin name for any incorporation whatever. The university of smiths, the university of tailors, etc., are expressions which we commonly meet with in the old charters of ancient towns [...] As to have wrought seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary in order to entitle any person to become a master, and to have himself apprenticed in a common trade; so to have studied seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary to entitle him to become a master, teacher, or doctor (words anciently synonymous) in the liberal arts, and to have scholars or apprentices (words likewise originally synonymous) to study under him.
Also similar to apprenticeships are the professional development arrangements for new graduates in the professions of accountancy, engineering, management consulting, and the law. A British example was training contracts known as &#x27;articles of clerkship&#x27;. The learning curve in modern professional service firms, such as law firms, consultancies or accountancies, generally resembles the traditional master-apprentice model: the newcomer to the firm is assigned to one or several more experienced colleagues (ideally partners in the firm) and learns their skills on the job.

<text>Albert Stubbins (17 July 1919 – 28 December 2002) was an English footballer who played as a centre forward. His career was limited by the onset of World War II. While playing for Liverpool, he won the League Championship in 1947. He was later included on the front cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album.

==Career==
Born in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, England, he spent his early years in the United States, returning to Wallsend, where he attended Carville School, in 1929. Stubbins first played for Newcastle United in 1937, appearing in official games 30 times and scoring six goals for the team. In wartime games (classified as friendlies) he scored 231 goals in just 188 appearances.

In 1946 he was signed by Liverpool for a then club record of £12,500. Stubbins had also been approached by Liverpool&#x27;s closest rivals, Everton, and he settled the decision with a toss of the coin. He made an immediate impact at the club: making his debut on 14 September 1946 in a league match at Burnden Park he scored an 82nd-minute goal as the Reds left it late to claim a 3–1 victory over Bolton Wanderers.

Following his move to Liverpool, Stubbins scored 28 goals (24 league goals) in the 1946–47 season (making him joint top scorer with Jack Balmer) helping Liverpool to win the League Championship, their first in 24 years. Stubbins also scored 24 goals the following season. Although a contractual dispute in the 1948–49 season limited his appearances for the Merseyside club, he then helped Liverpool reach the 1950 FA Cup Final, the first time Liverpool had appeared at Wembley. However, they lost to Arsenal by two goals to nil.

On 18 October 1950, at Blackpool&#x27;s Bloomfield Road, Stubbins netted five goals in the Football League&#x27;s 6–3 victory over the Irish League in an exhibition match.

Injuries forced him to retire in 1953, having scored 83 goals in 178 appearances, or 1 every 2.1 games. Despite his club success, he played for the England only once, in an unofficial international against Wales in 1945, a game England lost 1–0.

==Later life==
Following his retirement, Stubbins entered a full-time career in sports journalism, although he briefly coached an American semi-professional side, the New York Americans in 1960.

Stubbins later appeared on the front cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album, the only footballer to be depicted. He also has a Liverpool FC fan club named in his honour. He also featured as a minor character in Stephen Baxter&#x27;s time-travelling novel &quot;The Time Ships&quot;. He died in 2002, aged 83, after a short illness.

<text>A braided river (also called braided channel or braided stream) consists of a network of river channels separated by small, often temporary, islands called &quot;braid bars&quot; or, in British English usage, &quot;aits&quot; or &quot;eyots&quot;.

Braided streams tend to occur in rivers with high sediment loads or coarse grain sizes, and in rivers with steeper slopes than typical rivers with straight or meandering channel patterns. They are also associated with rivers with rapid and frequent variation in the amount of water they carry, i.e., with &quot;flashy&quot; rivers, and with rivers with weak banks.

Braided channels are found in a variety of environments all over the world, including gravelly mountain streams, sand bed rivers, on alluvial fans, on river deltas, and across depositional plains.

==Description==
A braided river consists of a network of multiple shallow channels that diverge and rejoin around ephemeral &quot;braid bars&quot;. This gives the river a fancied resemblance to the interwoven strands of a braid. The braid bars, also known as channel bars, branch islands, or accreting islands, are usually unstable and may be completely covered at times of high water. The channels and braid bars are usually highly mobile, with the river layout often changing significantly during flood events. When the islets separating channels are stabilized by vegetation, so that they are more permanent features, they are sometimes called aits or eyots.

A braided river differs from a &quot;meandering river&quot;, which has a single sinuous channel. It is also distinct from an &quot;anastomosing river&quot;, which consist of multiple interweaving semi-permanent channels which are separated by floodplain rather than channel bars; these channels may themselves be braided.

==Formation==

The physical processes that determine whether a river will be braided or meandering are not fully understood. However, there is wide agreement that a river becomes braided when it carries an abundant supply of sediments.

Experiments with flumes suggest that a river becomes braided when a threshold level of sediment load or slope is reached. On timescales long enough for the river to evolve, a sustained increase in sediment load will increase the bed slope of the river, so that a variation of slope is equivalent to a variation in sediment load, provided the amount of water carried by the river is unchanged. A threshold slope was experimentally determined to be 0.016 (ft/ft) for a stream with poorly sorted coarse sand. Any slope over this threshold created a braided stream, while any slope under the threshold created a meandering stream or – for very low slopes – a straight channel. Also important to channel development is the proportion of suspended load sediment to bed load. An increase in suspended sediment allowed for the deposition of fine erosion-resistant material on the inside of a curve, which accentuated the curve and in some instances, caused a river to shift from a braided to a meandering profile.

These experimental results were expressed in formulas relating the critical slope for braiding to the discharge and grain size. The higher the discharge, the lower the critical slope, while larger grain size yields a higher critical slope. However, these give only an incomplete picture, and numerical simulations have become increasingly important for understanding braided rivers.

Aggradation (net deposition of sediments) favors braided rivers, but is not essential. For example, the Rakaia and Waitaki Rivers of New Zealand are not aggrading, due to retreating shorelines, but are nonetheless braided rivers. Variable discharge has also been identified as important in braided rivers, but this may be primarily due to the tendency for frequent floods to reduce bank vegetation and destabilize the banks, rather than because variable discharge is an essential part of braided river formation.

Numerical models suggest that bedload transport (movement of sediment particles by rolling or bouncing along the river bottom) is essential to formation of braided rivers, with net erosion of sediments at channel divergences and net deposition at convergences. Braiding is reliably reproduced in simulations whenever there is little lateral constraint on flow and there is significant bedload transport. Braiding is not observed in simulations of the extreme cases of pure scour (no deposition taking place), which produces a dendritic system, or of cohesive sediments with no bedload transport. Meanders fully develop only when the river banks are sufficiently stabilized to limit lateral flow. An increase in suspended sediment relative to bedload allows the deposition of fine erosion-resistant material on the inside of a curve, which accentuated the curve and in some instances, causes a river to shift from a braided to a meandering profile. A stream with cohesive banks that are resistant to erosion will form narrow, deep, meandering channels, whereas a stream with highly erodible banks will form wide, shallow channels, preventing the helical flow of the water necessary for meandering and resulting in the formation of braided channels.

==Occurrences==
Braided rivers occur in many environments, but are most common in wide valleys associated with mountainous regions or their piedmonts or in areas of coarse-grained sediments and limited growth of vegetation near the river banks. They are also found on fluvial (stream-dominated) alluvial fans. Extensive braided river systems are found in Alaska, Canada, New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, and the Himalayas, which all contain young, rapidly eroding mountains.

* The enormous Brahmaputra river in Northeastern India is a classic example of a braided river.
* A notable example of a large braided stream in the contiguous United States is the Platte River in central and western Nebraska. Platte-type braided rivers are characterized by abundant linguoid (tonguelike) bar and dune deposits.
* The Scott River of southern Alaska is the type for braided glacial outwash rivers characterized by longitudinal gravel bars and by sand lenses deposited in scours from times of high water.
* The Donjek River of the Yukon Basin is the type for braided rivers showing repeated cycles of deposition, with finer sediments towards the top of each cycle.
* The Bijou Creek of Colorado is the type for braided rivers characterized by laminated sand deposits emplaced during floods.
* A portion of the lower Yellow River takes a braided form.
* The Sewanee Conglomerate, a Pennsylvanian coarse sandstone and conglomerate unit present on the Cumberland Plateau near the University of the South, may have been deposited by an ancient braided and meandering river that once existed in the eastern United States. Others have interpreted the depositional environment for this unit as a tidal delta.

* The Tagliamento of Italy is an example of a gravel bed braided river.
* The Piave, also in Italy, is an example of a river that is transitioning from braided to meandering due to human interventions.
* The Waimakariri River of New Zealand is an example of a braided river with an extensive floodplain.

<text>The national flag of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, commonly known as North Korea, consists of a wide horizontal red stripe bordered above and below by a thin white stripe and a broad blue stripe. The red stripe is charged near the hoist with a five-pointed red star inside a white disc. The design of the flag is defined in the North Korean constitution and regulations regarding the use and manufacture of the flag are outlined in the country&#x27;s national flag law. The North Korean government credits Kim Il Sung, the country&#x27;s founder and first leader, as the designer of the flag. The flag was officially adopted on 8 September 1948, with the passing of North Korea&#x27;s first constitution by the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly. The North Korean flag is banned in South Korea by the National Security Act. 

== Names ==
In North Korea, the flag is known by various names, including the &quot;Blue and Red Flag of the Republic&quot;, the &quot;Blue and Red National Flag&quot;, the &quot;Red-Blue Five-Pointed Star Flag&quot;, and the &quot;Flag of the Republic&quot;. In South Korea, it is known as the &quot;Flag of the People&#x27;s Republic&quot; or pejoratively as the &quot;Flag of the Northern Puppet&quot;.

== Design ==
The design of the flag is defined in Chapter VII, Article 170 of the Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, 1948 (2014 revision). It states:

The article was retained from the country&#x27;s provisional constitution, which was drafted in late 1947 and adopted at a special session of the People&#x27;s Assembly of North Korea in February 1948. During the session, assembly chairman Kim Tu-bong read the article describing the national flag (originally Article 100) and asked for opinions from delegates. Representative An Mong-yong expressed his concerns that the flag would fold easily when hoisted because of its length, and proposed changing the width-to-length ratio of the flag from 1:2 to 2:3. An&#x27;s proposal was dismissed by Kim Tu-bong, who assured An that the existing dimensions would not be a problem.

=== Symbolism ===
Different sources give conflicting explanations of the flag&#x27;s symbolism. According to an article published on 8 August 2013 in the &quot;Rodong Sinmun&quot;, the official newspaper of the ruling Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, Kim Il Sung gave the following significance to the flag&#x27;s elements after designing it:

Pak Il, a Soviet-Korean interpreter who claims to have translated from Russian the original flag designs proposed by the Soviet government, claimed that the flag was initially intended to be hoisted vertically, and gave the following as the original explanation of the flag&#x27;s symbolism:

The US Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s &quot;World Factbook&quot; meanwhile states that the colours of the flagred, white, and blueare considered national colours and symbolise, respectively: revolutionary traditions; purity, strength, and dignity; and sovereignty, peace, and friendship. It also states that the red star is a national symbol and represents socialism.

=== Construction ===
The North Korean government has specified sizes, colours, and manufacturing parameters in which the flag is to be made. They are detailed in Appendix I of the National Flag Law of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, 1992 (2012 revision). The width-to-length ratio of the flag is 1:2. The flag is divided into six vertical sections, with the top and bottom sixths being blue stripes. The middle four-sixths further divide into 24 sections, with the top and bottom twenty-fourths being white stripes, and the other twenty-two twenty-fourths being red. The center of the red star (and of the white disc that surrounds it) is at half the flag&#x27;s height and one-third of its length. The diameter of the white disc is two-thirds the combined height of the red and white stripes. The imaginary disc described by the points of the red star has a diameter equal to half the height of the white stripe from the white disc&#x27;s diameter. The points of the red star do not touch the circumference of the white disc.

== Protocol ==
The national flag law outlines regulations regarding the display and handling of the national flag. The North Korean flag is flown regularly from the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, government buildings, courtrooms, and diplomatic missions abroad. It may also be flown from &quot;other required places and the government office buildings of overseas Korean residents&#x27; organizations&quot;. Gold tassels measuring one-eighth of the flag width may be attached to the fly side of flags flown during diplomatic ceremonies. The flag is flown or draped as a symbol of the state during state holidays and memorial days, election days, and important state events. Between April and September, the flag should be raised at around 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. and lowered at around 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. Between October and March, the flag should be raised at around 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. and lowered at around 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. The flag must be raised and lowered slowly by a designated person with an assistant present. The flag must be raised to the end of the flagpole regardless of its use at full-mast or half-mast; in the latter case, the flag should be lowered after reaching the end. The flag may not be raised in severe weather conditions. Damaged, faded or substandard flags must not be used.

The national flag of North Korea takes precedent over other flags of the state, but not necessarily the flags of other countries. When the national flag is flown with other flags of the state, it should be flown first, either in the center or on the opposite left, and higher than the others. During a parade, it should be flown at the front of the procession. The North Korean flag should only be flown alongside the national flags of countries which recognise North Korea; in such cases, all flags must be of the same size and height.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Korea adopted its first national flag, the &quot;taegukgi&quot; () or &quot;Flag of Great Extremes&quot;, in 1882. The &quot;taegukgi&quot; is a white field with a centered blue and red &quot;taegeuk&quot; surrounded by four trigrams, representing sky, water, land, and fire. It was used by the Korean Empire up until its annexation by Imperial Japan in 1910. The flag of Japan subsequently replaced the &quot;taegukgi&quot; as the national flag flown on the Korean peninsula, and the &quot;taegukgi&quot; became a symbol of anti-Japanese resistance and Korean independence.

The Allies&#x27; victory in World War II in 1945 resulted in Japan relinquishing control over Korea and the peninsula being divided into two occupation zones. The Soviet Union occupied the northern half of Korea while the United States occupied the southern half. The &quot;taegukgi&quot; was widely used in both occupation zones, and it was not until 1947 that the Soviets began proposing a new flag to their Korean allies.

=== Creation ===

==== Official account ====
The North Korean government credits Kim Il Sung with designing the country&#x27;s national flag. According to a &quot;Tongil News&quot; report of an article by the state-run &quot;Rodong Sinmun&quot;, Kim Il Sung began expressing the necessity of a new national flag and emblem in January 1948. He argued that they were important for future national affairs and would strengthen national pride. A team of artists was tasked with proposing designs for the new flag. Kim Il Sung initially chose a design similar to the flag that was adopted, except its width-to-length ratio was 2:3 and the white disc was in the center and did not feature a charge. In February 1948, Kim Il Sung instructed the artists to change the ratio to 1:2, to add a five-pointed red star to the inside of the disc, and to move the disc towards the hoist. The flag design was then accepted by the Constitutional Reform Committee and written into the provisional constitution on 20 February 1948 and confirmed by a special committee of the People&#x27;s Assembly on 28 April. A ceremony was held on 10 July 1948 to take down the &quot;taegukgi&quot; and install the new flag in the meeting place, but the new flag&#x27;s adoption was not official until the passing of North Korea&#x27;s first constitution by the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly on 8 September. The flag design was standardised with the passing of the national flag law on 22 October 1992.

The decision to change the national flag was relatively unpopular among politically active Koreans at the beginning. Lyuh Woon-hyung, for example, described the flag change as &quot;not right&quot;. The Chondoist Chongu Party also criticised the new design and occasionally refused to participate in demonstrations under the flag. When the flag design in the provisional constitution was first read and debated, the representative Chong Chae-yong defended the &quot;taegukgi&quot; as a symbol of the Korean people&#x27;s liberation, cherished by Koreans in both the north and south. Following the flag&#x27;s approval by the People&#x27;s Assembly in April 1948, Kim Tu-bong felt it necessary to defend the new flag and published a book in August titled &quot;On the Establishment of the New National Flag and the Abolition of the Taegukgi&quot;. In it, he praises the new flag as a symbol of the country&#x27;s future and discredits the design of the &quot;taegukgi&quot; as overly complex, unintelligible, and rooted in superstition.

The North Korean artist Kim Chu-gyong was originally credited by the North Korean government as the flag&#x27;s designer. On the 30th anniversary of the founding of North Korea in 1978, he was given an award for designing the North Korean flag and emblem, and a book was published titled &quot;In the Embrace of Grace&quot;, which included some of his collected writings. He also wrote a detailed account of how he was ordered by Kim Il Sung to make the designs in November 1947, titled &quot;The Story of Our Country&#x27;s National Emblem and National Flag&quot;.

==== Pak Il&#x27;s account ====
Pak Il, a Soviet-Korean interpreter for the Soviet 25th Army, gave a different account of the flag&#x27;s creation in two interviews, one to the Russian magazine &quot;Sovershenno Sekretno&quot; in 1992 and another to the South Korean newspaper &quot;The Dong-A Ilbo&quot; in 1993. According to Pak, the Soviets were responsible for proposing and designing the flag. In 1947, Soviet major general Nikolai Georgiyevich Lebedev summoned Kim Tu-bong to discuss whether the &quot;taegukgi&quot; should be retained by a newly-founded North Korea. Kim Tu-bong was in favour of keeping the &quot;taegukgi&quot; and attempted to explain to Lebedev the flag&#x27;s significance within East Asian philosophy. Lebedev dismissed Kim Tu-bong&#x27;s lecture as nonsense and superstition. A few months later, the Soviets sent a Russian-language document outlining their design to the 7th Department of the 25th Army. Pak was asked to translate it to Korean, and it eventually became the flag of North Korea. Pak&#x27;s account of the flag&#x27;s creation was corroborated by fellow Soviet-Korean Chŏng Sangjin, who held prominent positions in the North Korean culture and propaganda ministry.

== Notable uses ==

=== In North Korean propaganda ===
The North Korean flag is frequently used in state propaganda. For example, propaganda posters often include the national flag, but it is depicted less prominently than symbols of &quot;Juche&quot;, North Korea&#x27;s state ideology attributed to Kim Il Sung. American scholar Carter Matherly argues that this is meant to symbolise national unity under the guidance of &quot;Juche&quot;. Massive North Korean flags are also displayed during the Arirang Mass Games in Pyongyang. One such display is made by thousands of people holding up coloured cards.

The North Korean village of Kijong-dong, near the Military Demarcation Line and within the Korean Demilitarized Zone, is the location of a North Korean flag which flies from a flagpole. It was constructed in response to the South Korean side&#x27;s raising of a flag on a flagpole in Daeseong-dong.

=== In South Korea ===
It is illegal to carry or raise the North Korean flag in South Korea; the country&#x27;s National Security Act prohibits actions that may be interpreted as pro-communist. However, exceptions have been made for regional and international sports competitions, such as the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, and the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. During the 2002 Asian Games, the North Korean flag was permitted to fly at five locations: the Busan Asian Games Organizing Committee, the event&#x27;s main hotel, the press center, the athletes&#x27; village, and the conference room for representatives of participating countries. Nationals of all countries, including North Korea, were not permitted to carry North Korean flags. A volunteer raised the North Korean flag at the formal ceremonies of the 2014 Asian Games; every other competing country&#x27;s flag was raised by a South Korean soldier. The North Korean flag was flown at event venues during the 2018 Winter Olympics. However, the North Korean flag was not raised at the Pyeongchang Olympic Village during a public welcoming ceremony for competing countries. Instead, it was raised there at midnight, a day after the other competing countries&#x27; flags had already been raised. An official from the Pyeongchang Olympic Organizing Committee explained that the decision was made to avoid causing controversy over possibly violating the National Security Act. Anti-North Korea protesters burned the North Korean flag in front of the Olympic stadium hours before the games&#x27; opening ceremony.

=== Outside of Korea ===
The North Korean flag has been mistakenly used by a number of international organisations to represent South Korea. The organising committee of the 2003 Winter Universiade accidentally displayed the North Korean flag while explaining the accommodations for South Korean athletes. In 2008, the Asian Football Confederation used the North Korean flag in a post on its website about South Korea&#x27;s previous hosting of the tournament. In 2023, the official website of the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change displayed the North Korean flag for South Korea in its list of participants.

The North Korean flag has also been used to insult or mock South Koreans online. For example, South Korean taekwondo athlete Park Tae-joon&#x27;s social media posts received numerous comments with North Korean flag emojis in them after he won gold at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="162625" wikidata="Q366696" url="?curid=162625" title="Henry the Proud">
<text>Henry the Proud () (20 October 1139), a member of the House of Welf, was Duke of Bavaria (as Henry X) from 1126 to 1138 and Duke of Saxony (as Henry II) as well as Margrave of Tuscany and Duke of Spoleto from 1137 until his death. In 1138 he was a candidate for the election as King of the Romans but was defeated by Conrad of Hohenstaufen.

==Family==
Henry was the second son of Duke Henry IX of Bavaria and Wulfhilde, daughter of Duke Magnus of Saxony. He was thus not only a member of the Welf family, but, what was quite important, also senior heir of the Saxon House of Billung. Henry came of age in 1123, in 1126 his father retired to Weingarten Abbey where he and his wife died shortly afterwards. As his elder brother Conrad entered the Cistercian Order, Henry was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Bavaria. He shared the family possessions in Saxony, Bavaria and Swabia with his younger brother Welf VI.

In 1127, Henry married Gertrude, the only child of King Lothair III of Germany. Henry&#x27;s father had been promised her marriage and inheritance as reward for his changing to support Lothair in the royal election of 1125 against the Hohenstaufen rival Duke Frederick II of Swabia. Gertrude was heir of the properties of three Saxon dynasties: the House of Supplinburg, the Brunonids, and the counts of Northeim. The marriage marked the expansion of power of the Welf dynasty, Bavarian dukes since 1070, to the northern parts of Germany. The couple had a son, Henry the Lion.

==Career==
Henry was a loyal supporter in the warfare between his father-in-law King Lothair and the Hohenstaufen brothers, Duke Frederick II (who was Henry&#x27;s brother-in-law, having been married to his sister Judith) and Conrad, then duke in Franconia and anti-king of Germany. While engaged in this struggle, Henry was also occupied in suppressing a rising in Bavaria, led by Count Frederick of Bogen, during which both duke and count sought to establish their own candidates as bishop of Regensburg. After a war of devastation, Count Frederick submitted in 1133, and two years later the Hohenstaufen brothers made their peace with Emperor Lothair.

In 1136, Henry accompanied his father-in-law to Italy, and taking command of a Bavarian division of the Imperial army marched into the south Italian Kingdom of Sicily up to Bari, devastating the land as he went. Having distinguished himself by his military abilities during this campaign, Henry was appointed as margrave of Tuscany, succeeding Engelbert III of Sponheim, and as Lothair&#x27;s successor in the Duchy of Saxony. He was also given the private properties of late Margravine Matilda of Tuscany from the hands of Pope Innocent II.

When Emperor Lothair died on his way back from Italy in December 1137, Henry&#x27;s wealth and position made him a formidable candidate for the German crown. According to the contemporary chronicler Otto of Freising, after his appointment as Duke of Saxony he boasted of a realm stretching &quot;from sea to sea, from Denmark to Sicily&quot;.

However, the same qualities which earned him the cognomen of &quot;the Proud&quot; aroused the jealousy of the princes and so ultimately prevented his election. The new king, Conrad III, demanded the Imperial Regalia which Henry had received from Lothair, and the duke in return asked for his investiture with the Saxon duchy. But Conrad, who feared his power, refused to assent to this on the pretext that it was unlawful for two duchies to be in one hand.

Attempts at a settlement failed, and when in July 1138 Henry refused to take the oath of allegiance, he was banned and deprived of both his duchies. Bavaria was given to the Babenberg margrave Leopold IV of Austria, a half-brother of the new king Conrad. Saxony, which he had attempted to hold but was not officially invested with, was given to the Ascanian count Albert the Bear, son of Eilika of Saxony, a younger daughter of the last Billung duke Magnus.

==Death and aftermath==
In 1139 Henry succeeded in expelling his enemies from Saxony and was preparing to attack Bavaria when he suddenly died in Quedlinburg. Henry is buried in the Imperial Cathedral of Königslutter next to his parents-in-law Emperor Lothair and Richenza of Northeim. His death left his son Henry the Lion underage who later would be given Saxony, while Henry II, Duke of Austria received Bavaria.

Conrad the Priest probably wrote the , a German version of the , while in Henry&#x27;s service, at the request of Queen Gertrude.

<text>Las Piñas (, officially the City of Las Piñas (), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 606,293 people.

Las Piñas was sixth in MoneySense Philippines &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; report in 2008. Attractions include Evia Lifestyle Center, SM Southmall, Robinsons Place Las Piñas and Las Piñas - Parañaque Wetland Park.

==Etymology==
The story about the true origin of the city&#x27;s name, &quot;Las Piñas&quot;, varies. One version mentioned, that traders from the province of Cavite and Batangas shipped their first &quot;piñas&quot; (Spanish for pineapples) for sale to this town before they were distributed to nearby markets. Another version related that it was &quot;Las Peñas&quot; (the rocks), evident by the quarrying of stones and adobe which were used to construct buildings and bridges. The old church bell from St. Joseph Parish Church founded by Diego Cera has been preserved inside the church museum. An inscription on the bell states, &quot;Siendo cura del pueblo de Laspeñas el M.R.P. Padre Diego Cera se fundió este equilón año de 1820,&quot; showing that even during the time of Diego Cera, the town&#x27;s first parish priest, the town was called &quot;Las Peñas&quot;, for some time and eventually was renamed &quot;Las Piñas&quot;.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===

Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay. It was proclaimed as a province of Manila either in 1762 or 1797. Agustin, a Spanish historian, and Fr. Juan de Medina placed it at 1762. Las Piñas was formerly called &quot;Las Pilas&quot; due to its separation from Parañaque due to tribal conflicts. On the other hand, Manuel Buzeta recorded the date at 1797. Felix Timbang was the first &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; in 1762, while Mariano Ortiz was the first municipal president of the town of Las Piñas.

Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824. In 1880, the city experienced an outbreak of cholera and smallpox leading to the loss of many lives. Years later, Las Piñas also became a central battleground between Spanish and Philippine forces during the Philippine Revolution.

The town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by forces of General Emilio Aguinaldo.

===American invasion era===
In 1901, the municipality of Las Piñas, previously a part of the province of Manila, was incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to the Philippine Commission Act No. 137. On October 12, 1903, in accordance with Act No. 942, it was combined with the town of Parañaque, with the latter as the seat of a new municipal government.

It was separated from Parañaque to become an independent municipality again on March 27, 1907, by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625.

===Japanese occupation era===
The town was occupied by the Japanese during World War II and liberated by the combined American and Filipino forces.

===Philippine independence===
On November 7, 1975, through Presidential Decree No. 824, Las Piñas was excised from the province of Rizal to form Metro Manila. Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.

In the 1980s, economic growth erupted due to the advent of the construction of Coastal Road. Las Piñas currently serves as the proper gateway to Calabarzon.

In the 1990s, Las Piñas was known for its rampant illegal drug trade. In an October 1989 privileged speech, Senator Ernesto F. Herrera shared the National Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s findings that an estimated 40% of Las Piñas&#x27; police force was connected with a drug cartel. In 1995, then-Councilor Yoyoy Villame criticized the town&#x27;s image as the &quot;Drug Capital of the Philippines&quot;, while NCR Command Director Job Mayo alleged upon his appointment in early 1996 that the town&#x27;s police force had the most drug-dependent police officers in the metropolis.

===Cityhood===

On February 12, 1997, President Fidel V. Ramos signed the bill which elevated Las Piñas from municipality into a city. A plebiscite held a month after approved the city status by its residents, and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997. It has been a city for 27 years.

===2024 plebiscite and later events===
In 2023, the Sangguniang Panlungsod enacted City Ordinance No. 1941-23 Series of 2023 which sets the territorial boundaries of the 20 barangays Department of Environment and Natural Resources&#x27; based on the March 2015 Cadastre survey. Accordingly, the Commission on Elections scheduled the plebiscite for the Ordinance Ratification on June 29, 2024. It also set the gun control from May 28 until July 6, the alcohol ban on June 28 to 29, and the 20 barangays &quot;pulong-pulong&quot; from May 28 to June 27.

On June 30, the Commission on Elections reported that 41,493 (67%) registered voters voted “yes” while 19,498 said “no” against City Ordinance No. 1941-23. The City Plebiscite Board of Canvassers proclaimed the ratification by the majority of the votes cast on June 29. However, voter turnout was only 61,237 or 20% of the 308,059 registered voters.

==Geography==
Las Piñas is bounded to the northeast by Parañaque; to the southeast by Muntinlupa; to the west by Bacoor; to the southwest by Dasmariñas; and to the northwest by Manila Bay. Half of its land area is residential and the remaining half is used for commercial, industrial and institutional purposes. The present physiography of Las Piñas consists of three zones: Manila Bay, coastal margin and the Guadalupe Plateau.

===Climate===
===Districts and barangays===
Las Piñas is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. These barangays are grouped into two legislative districts, each with its own set of representatives in the city council. District 1 comprises the northwestern half of the city while District 2, the remaining half.

==Demographics==
===Language===
The native language of Las Piñas is Tagalog, but the majority of the residents understand and speak English.

===Religion===

People in Las Piñas are mainly Roman Catholic. Catholic churches in Las Piñas fall under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Parañaque. Las Piñas is home of the 2 prominent pilgrim Catholic Shrine: Diocesan Shrine of St. Joseph Parish and Diocesan Shrine of the Five Wounds of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

Other religions in Las Piñas include Members Church of God International (MCGI) various Protestant denominations, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Iglesia ni Cristo, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam. 

==Economy==

=== Coconuts ===
Coconut shells and husks, which were discarded by coconut vendors, previously blocked the rivers of Las Piñas and Zapote. Currently, coco coir nets are being utilized for lining the riverbanks.

This efficient natural alternative for flood prevention is 80% more cost-effective than traditional riprap techniques such as cement and stone and is also effective for stopping soil erosion.

Like a beehive comb, the net is woven to create openings for plant growth within the cells, allowing their long roots to help secure the soil. The coco coir net is more resistant to sun and water damage compared to plastic nets, making it more durable. Additionally, it is eco-friendly because the material breaks down gradually into tiny pieces that enrich the soil.

Additional applications for coir fiber involve utilizing it as a potting material for horticulture purposes, in hydroponic systems, and for managing erosion.

The different ways in which it is used have led to a higher need for the coconet, providing a means of income for several Las Piñas locals who turn coconut husks into nets through weaving.

The Las Piñas city officials have given out twining and weaving tools and offered electrical assistance to its residents who have turned coconet weaving into their personal family venture.

=== Salt-making industry ===
During the 18th century, the fishing village of Las Piñas adopted salt-making techniques with the use of solar dry beds. Over the years, numerous hectares encircling the ancient town were transformed into salt beds named &quot;irasan&quot;.

Afterwards, clay tiles or gibak were transported from as distant as Vigan to cover the salt beds. This kept the salt from touching the ground, resulting in the salt turning as white as snow and making Las Piñas known as a hub for salt production.

At the time of harvesting, Las Piñas was adorned with small white crystal pyramids. The salt was sorted and categorized into tertia, segunda, and primera grades.

Tertia salt was the darkest in color and had the highest amount of impurities. Dry ice was combined with this salt to keep ice cream fresh.

Segunda salt was utilized for the purpose of preserving fresh fish. Navotas and Malabon were the primary purchasers of segunda salt among the wholesale seafood trading communities.

However, Las Piñas was renowned for its high-quality salt, also known as primera, rumored to be as white as snow. The initial batch of salt was delivered to every public market in Manila and utilized to enhance the taste of gourmet meals.

The bay area&#x27;s restoration and the resulting Coastal Road construction caused interference with salt production. The dredging and construction activities hindered fishermen from venturing out to the ocean. Most of the salt being produced started entering the cheaper segunda and tertia categories. Salt that was brought in from countries such as China and India was available for purchase at reduced costs. The salt production industry in Las Piñas has come to an end and is now just a reminiscence of the past.

In 2005, an Irasan Center was constructed where visitors could view a salt bed demonstration in commemoration of Las Piñas’ once much celebrated industry.

==Government==
===Local government===

Las Piñas, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Las Piñas is headed by a mayor who heads the city&#x27;s executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city&#x27;s legislative function, which is composed of twelve councilors, six each from the city&#x27;s two city council districts. For representation, the city is considered as one district, and therefore one representative, in the country&#x27;s House of Representatives.

Like other cities and municipalities, Las Piñas is subdivided into barangays.

, the mayor of Las Pinas is Imelda Aguilar and the vice mayor is April Aguilar.

==Healthcare==

=== Free hospitalisation via Green Card ===
Each legitimate inhabitant is eligible for complimentary medical care valued at PhP 30,000 supported by the municipal administration. The hospitalization plan covers small surgeries and stays approved at Las Piñas Doctors Hospital, San Juan De Dios Hospital, and Philippine General Hospital and Medical Center. This is in addition to being able to receive free medical and dental care at 30 state-of-the-art health centers in the city. The Las Piñas Maternity Clinic provides superior maternal and child health care for mothers and their children.

The Green Card Program started in 2000 and currently has over 80,000 Green Card holders. It has greatly helped in making health care more accessible to the city&#x27;s residents and improving their overall quality of life.

The city government&#x27;s prioritization of health care, which includes improving health facilities and implementing sustainable health programs, was acknowledged by the Department of Health (DOH) with the Sentrong Sigla Award.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
Las Piñas is part of the route of the extension of the LRT Line 1, the South Extension Project. The actual construction officially started on Tuesday, May 7, 2019 because the Right-of-way is &quot;free and clear&quot; from obstructions. Once it is fully operational, Las Piñas will be served by the LRT Line 1 through the Las Piñas station and Zapote station.

, phase 1 is 100% complete. The Department of Transportation Executive Assistant, Jonathan Gesmundo, announced the successful completion of Phase 1 of the LRT-1 Cavite Extension. This milestone has added eight new stations to the existing 20 stations, significantly enhancing the transportation network.

Looking ahead, the Department of Transportation has confirmed that work on Phases 2 and 3 of the LRT-1 Cavite Extension is progressing. These subsequent phases are expected to further expand the line and improve transit services in the region, with operations slated to begin by 2031.

===Road network===

The road network of Las Piñas is radial in nature, and primarily relies on the Alabang–Zapote Road (N411), which serves as the city&#x27;s road network backbone. The Manila-Cavite Expressway (formerly Coastal Road, and numbered E3), a toll expressway serves as the major traffic route towards Manila. Daang Hari, which hugs near the boundary with Muntinlupa, and the Aguinaldo Highway (N62) are the major traffic routes toward Cavite. The Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway (MCX), which leads to South Luzon Expressway, supplements Daang Hari as an alternative to the congested Alabang-Zapote Road over Alabang and Ayala Alabang in Muntinlupa.

The road network in Las Piñas suffers from traffic jams, especially on the primary artery, Alabang-Zapote Road, which carried more than 70,000 vehicles daily as of 2016. Public transport, like buses and jeepneys, fill up Alabang-Zapote Road, therefore causing further congestion. The city government petitioned the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend issuing of franchises on bus and jeepneys routes that uses Alabang-Zapote Road.

The Las Piñas Friendship Route network serves as the alternate routes on the congested routes, but motorists have to obtain and display a sticker on their vehicle to use these routes, as most roads of the network are located in privately owned subdivisions (gated communities), like BF Homes, Pilar Village, and BF Resort.

====Public transport====
Jeepneys and buses form the major public transport system, and most of their routes follow the Alabang-Zapote Road. Most jeepneys through Las Piñas travel between Alabang and Zapote, within the city, or Baclaran, in Parañaque. Buses usually form routes between Alabang or SM Southmall and destinations in Manila. Buses and jeepneys are blamed for the worsening congestion on Alabang-Zapote Road.

==Culture==

On February 22, 1995, then President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act 8003 into a law – declaring Las Piñas Church and Bamboo Organ, Las Piñas Bridge, Asinan Area, Father Diego Cera Bridge, and Old District Hospital as tourist spots of Las Piñas.

Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ located inside the St. Joseph Parish Church in the old district of the city. Built in 1824 by a Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, it is the only organ of its kind in the world with organ pipes mostly made out of bamboo.

Las Piñas is also the home of the only church dedicated to the Five Wounds of Jesus Christ in the Philippines and in Asia. The Diocesan Shrine of the Five Wounds of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the first diocesan shrine in Las Piñas, is located in District 2 of the City.

===Las Piñas Historical Corridor===
The Las Piñas Historical Corridor Project was a program laid to restore the Old Town of Las Piñas. It was launched at the Malacañan Heroes&#x27; Hall on November 13, 1997. The project aims to educate the people of Las Piñas along the tourist corridor.

===Las Piñas Town Fiesta===
The town fiesta of Las Piñas is celebrated every first Sunday of May each year to honor its patron saint, Saint Joseph. Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day celebration is centered in St. Joseph Parish Church in the old poblacion of Las Piñas in Barangay Daniel Fajardo on Padre Diego Cera Ave. (Quirino Ave.). Las Piñas was also the home of Mary Immaculate Parish Church, popularly known as the Nature Church, designed by architect Francisco &quot;Bobby&quot; Mañosa.

<doc id="162634" wikidata="Q315346" url="?curid=162634" title="Thomas Moore">
<text>Thomas Moore (28 May 1779 – 25 February 1852), was an Irish writer, poet, and lyricist celebrated for his &quot;Irish Melodies&quot;. His setting of English-language verse to old Irish tunes marked the transition in popular Irish culture from Irish to English. Politically, Moore was recognised in England as a press, or &quot;squib&quot;, writer for the aristocratic Whigs; in Ireland he was accounted a Catholic patriot.

Married to a Protestant actress and hailed as &quot;Anacreon Moore&quot; after the classical Greek composer of drinking songs and erotic verse, Moore did not profess religious piety. Yet in the controversies that surrounded Catholic Emancipation, Moore was seen to defend the tradition of the Church in Ireland against both evangelising Protestants and uncompromising lay Catholics. Longer prose works reveal more radical sympathies. The &quot;Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald&quot; depicts the United Irish leader as a martyr in the cause of democratic reform. Complementing Maria Edgeworth&#x27;s &quot;Castle Rackrent&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of Captain Rock&quot; is a saga, not of Anglo-Irish landowners, but of their exhausted tenants driven to the semi-insurrection of &quot;Whiteboyism&quot;.

Today Moore is best remembered for his &quot;Irish Melodies&quot; (typically &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot; and &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot;), his chivalric romance Lalla Rookh and, less generously, for the role he is thought to have played in the loss of the memoirs of his friend Lord Byron.

==Early life and artistic launch==

Thomas Moore was born to Anastasia Codd from Wexford and John Moore from County Kerry over his parents&#x27; grocery shop in Aungier Street, Dublin, He had two younger sisters, Kate and Ellen. Moore showed an early interest in music and performance, staging musical plays with his friends and entertaining hope of being an actor. In Dublin he attended Samuel Whyte&#x27;s co-educational English grammar school, where he was schooled in Latin and Greek and became fluent in French and Italian. By age fourteen he had had one of his poems published in a new literary magazine called the &quot;Anthologia Hibernica&quot; (“Irish Anthology”).

Samuel Whyte had taught Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Irish playwright and English Whig politician, of whom Moore later was to write a biography.

===Trinity College and the United Irishmen===
In 1795, Moore was among the first Catholics admitted to Trinity College Dublin, preparing, as his mother had hoped, for a career in law. Through the literary salon of the poet and satirist Henrietta Battier, and his friends at Trinity, Robert Emmett and Edward Hudson, Moore was connected to the popular politics of the capital agitated by the French Revolution and by the prospect of a French invasion. With their encouragement, in 1797, Moore wrote an appeal to his fellow students to resist the proposal, then being canvassed by the English-appointed Dublin Castle administration, to secure Ireland by incorporating the kingdom in a union with Great Britain. In April 1798, Moore was interrogated at Trinity but acquitted on the charge of being a party, through the Society of United Irishmen, to sedition.

Moore, though a friend of Emmett, had not taken the United Irish oath with Emmett and Hudson, and he played no part in the republican rebellion of 1798 (Moore was at home, ill in bed), or in the uprising in Dublin for which Emmett was executed in 1803. Later, in a biography of the United Irish leader Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1831), he made clear his sympathies, not hiding his regret that the French expedition under General Hoche failed in December 1796 to effect a landing. To Emmett&#x27;s sacrifice on the gallows Moore pays homage in the song &quot;O, Breathe Not His Name&quot; (1808). More veiled references to Emmett are found in the long oriental poem &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; (1817).

===London society and first success===
In 1799, Moore continued his law studies at Middle Temple in London. The impecunious student was assisted by friends in the expatriate Irish community in London, including Barbara, widow of Arthur Chichester, 1st Marquess of Donegall, the landlord and borough-owner of Belfast.

Moore&#x27;s translations of Anacreon, celebrating wine, women and song, were published in 1800 with a dedication to the Prince of Wales. His introduction to the future prince regent and King, George IV was a high point in Moore&#x27;s ingratiation with aristocratic and literary circles in London, a success due in great degree to his talents as a singer and songwriter. In the same year he collaborated briefly as a librettist with Michael Kelly in the comic opera, &quot;The Gypsy Prince&quot;, staged at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket,

In 1801, Moore hazarded a collection of his own verse: &quot;Poetical Works of the Late Thomas Little Esq.&quot;. The pseudonym may have been advised by their juvenile eroticism. Moore&#x27;s celebration of kisses and embraces skirted contemporary standards of propriety. When these tightened in the Victorian era, they were to put an end to what was a relative publishing success.

==Travels and family==
===Observations of America and duel with critic===
In the hope of future advancement, Moore reluctantly sailed from London in 1776 to take up a government post secured through the favours of Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 2nd Earl of Moira. Lord Moira was a man distinct in his class for having, on the eve of the rebellion in Ireland, continued to protest against government and loyalist outrages, and to have urged a policy of conciliation. Moore was to be the registrar of the Admiralty Prize Court in Bermuda. Although as late as 1925 still recalled as &quot;the poet laureate&quot; of the island, Moore found life on Bermuda sufficiently dull that after six months he appointed a deputy and left for an extended tour of North America. As in London, Moore secured high-society introductions in the United States including to the President, Thomas Jefferson. Repelled by the provincialism of the average American, Moore consorted with exiled European aristocrats, come to recover their fortunes, and with oligarchic Federalists from whom he received what he later conceded was a &quot;twisted and tainted&quot; view of the new republic.

Following his return to England in 1804, Moore published &quot;Epistles, Odes, and Other Poems&quot; (1806). In addition to complaints about America and Americans (including their defence of slavery), this catalogued Moore&#x27;s real and imagined escapades with American women. Francis Jeffrey denounced the volume in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; (July 1806), calling Moore &quot;the most licentious of modern versifiers&quot;, a poet whose aim is &quot;to impose corruption upon his readers, by concealing it under the mask of refinement.&quot; Moore challenged Jeffrey to a duel but their confrontation was interrupted by the police. In what seemed to be a &quot;pattern&quot; in Moore&#x27;s life (&quot;it was possible to condemn [Moore] only if you did not know him&quot;), the two then became fast friends.

Moore, nonetheless, was dogged by the report that the police had found that the pistol given to Jeffrey was unloaded. In his satirical &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot; (1809), Byron, who had himself been stung by one of Jeffrey&#x27;s reviews, suggested Moore&#x27;s weapon was also &quot;leadless&quot;: &quot;on examination, the balls of the pistols, like the courage of the combatants, were found to have evaporated&quot;. To Moore, this was scarcely more satisfactory, and he wrote to Byron implying that unless the remarks were clarified, Byron, too, would be challenged. In the event, when Byron, who had been abroad, returned there was again reconciliation and a lasting friendship.

In 1809, Moore was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

===Marriage and children===
Between 1808 and 1810, Moore appeared each year in Kilkenny, Ireland, with a charitable mixed repertory of professional players and high-society amateurs. He favoured comic roles in plays like Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot; and O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Andalusia&quot;. Among the professionals, on stage in Kilkenny with her sister, the tragedienne-to-be Mary Ann Duff, was Elizabeth &quot;Bessy&quot; Dyke. In 1811, Moore married Bessy in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. Together with Bessy&#x27;s lack of a dowry, the Protestant ceremony may have been the reason why Moore kept the match for some time secret from his parents. Bessy shrank from fashionable society to such an extent that many of her husband&#x27;s friends never met her (some of them jokingly doubted her very existence). Those who did held her in high regard.

The couple first set up house in London, then in the country at Kegworth, Leicestershire, and in Lord Moira&#x27;s neighbourhood at Mayfield Cottage in Staffordshire, and finally in Sloperton Cottage in Wiltshire near the country seat of another close friend and patron, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne. Their company included Sheridan and John Philpot Curran, both in their bitter final years.

Thomas and Bessy had five children, none of whom survived them. Three girls died young, and both sons lost their lives as young men. One of them, Thomas Landsdowne Parr Moore, as a lowly officer fought first with the British Army in Afghanistan, and then with French Foreign Legion in Algeria. He was dying of tuberculosis that riddled the family when, according to Foreign Legion records, he was killed in action on 6 February 1846.
Despite these heavy personal losses, the marriage of Thomas Moore is generally regarded to have been a happy one.

===Debt exile, last meeting with Byron===
In 1818, it was discovered that the man Moore had appointed his deputy in Bermuda had embezzled 6,000 pounds sterling, a large sum for which Moore was liable. To escape debtor&#x27;s prison, in September 1819, Moore left for France, travelling with Lord John Russell (future Whig prime minister and editor of Moore&#x27;s journals and letters). In Venice in October, Moore saw Byron for the last time. Byron entrusted him with a manuscript for his memoirs, which, as his literary executor, Moore promised to have published after Byron&#x27;s death.

In Paris, Moore was joined by Bessy and the children. His social life was busy, often involving meetings with Irish and British and travellers such as Maria Edgeworth and William Wordsworth. However, his attempt to bridge the gulf in his connections between his exiled fellow countrymen and members of the British establishment was not always successful. In 1821, several emigres, prominent among them Myles Byrne (a veteran of Vinegar Hill and of Napoleon&#x27;s Irish Legion) refused to attend a St Patrick&#x27;s day dinner Moore had organised in Paris because of the presiding presence of Wellesley Pole Long, a nephew of the Duke of Wellington.

Once Moore learned the Bermuda debt had been partly cleared with the help of Lord Lansdowne (whom Moore repaid almost immediately by a draft on Longman, his publisher), the family, after more than a year, returned to Sloperton Cottage.

==Political and historical writing==
===Squib writer for the Whigs===
To support his family Moore entered the field of political squib writing on behalf of his Whig friends and patrons. The Whigs had been split by the divided response of Edmund Burke and Charles Fox to the French Revolution. But with the antics of the Prince Regent, and in particular, his highly public efforts to disgrace and divorce Princess Caroline, proving a lightning rod for popular discontent, they were finding new unity and purpose.

From the &quot;Whigs as Whigs&quot;, Moore claimed not to have received &quot;even the semblance of a favour&quot; (Lord Moira, they &quot;hardly acknowledge as one of themselves&quot;). And with exceptions &quot;easily counted&quot;, Moore was convinced that there was &quot;just as much selfishness and as much low-party spirit among them generally as the Tories&quot;. But for Moore, the fact that the Prince Regent held fast against Catholic admission to parliament may have been reason sufficient to turn on his former friend and patron. Moore&#x27;s Horatian mockery of the Prince in the pages of &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; were collected in &quot;Intercepted Letters, or the Two-Penny Post-Bag&quot; (1813).

===The lampooning of Castlereagh===
Another, and possibly more personal, target for Moore was the Foreign Secretary Lord Castlereagh. A reform-minded Ulster Presbyterian turned Anglican Tory, as Irish Secretary Castlereagh had been ruthless in the suppression of the United Irishmen and in pushing the Act of Union through the Irish Parliament. In what were the &quot;verbal equivalents of the political cartoons of the day&quot;, &quot;Tom Crib&#x27;s Memorial to Congress&quot; (1818) and &quot;Fables for the Holy Alliance&quot; (1823), Moore lampoons Castlereagh&#x27;s deference to the reactionary interests of Britain&#x27;s continental allies. Widely read, so that Moore eventually produced a sequel, was the verse novel &quot;The Fudge Family in Paris&quot; (1818). The family of an Irishman working as a propagandist for Castlereagh in Paris, the Fudges are accompanied by an accomplished tutor and classicist, Phelim Connor. An upright but disillusioned Irish Catholic, his letters to a friend reflect Moore&#x27;s own views.

Connor&#x27;s regular epistolary denunciations of Castlereagh have two recurrent themes. The first is Castlereagh as &quot;the embodiment of the sickness with which Ireland had infected British politics as a consequence of the union&quot;: &quot;We sent thee Castlereagh – as heaps of dead Have slain their slayers by the pest they spread&quot;. The second is that at the time of the Acts of Union Castlereagh&#x27;s support for Catholic emancipation had been disingenuous. Castlereagh had been master of &quot;that faithless craft&quot;, which can &quot;court the slave, can swear he shall be freed&quot;, but then &quot;basely spurns him&quot; when his &quot;point is gain&#x27;d&quot;.

Through a mutual connection, Moore learned that Castlereagh had been particularly stung by the verses of the Tutor in the &quot;Fudge Family.&quot; For openly casting the same dispersions against the former Chief Secretary—that he bloodied his hands in 1798 and deliberately deceived Catholics at the time of the Union—in 1811 the London-based Irish publisher, and former United Irishman, Peter Finnerty was sentenced to eighteen months for libel.

===&quot;The Memoirs of Captain Rock&quot;===

As a partisan squib writer, Moore played a role not dissimilar to that of Jonathan Swift a century earlier. Moore greatly admired Swift as a satirist, but charged him with caring no more for the &quot;misery&quot; of his Roman Catholic countrymen &quot;than his own Gulliver for the sufferings of so many disenfranchised Yahoos&quot;. &quot;The Memoirs of Captain Rock&quot; might have been Moore&#x27;s response to those who questioned whether the son of a Dublin grocer entertaining English audiences from Wiltshire was himself connected to the great mass of his countrymen – to those whose remitted rents helped sustain the great houses among which he was privileged to move.

&quot;The Memoirs&quot; relate the history of Ireland as told by a contemporary, the scion of a Catholic family that lost land in successive English settlements. The character, Captain Rock, is folkloric but the history is in earnest. When it catches up with the narrator in the late Penal Law era, his family has been reduced to the &quot;class of wretched cottiers&quot;. Exposed to the voracious demands of spendthrift Anglo-Irish landlords (pilloried by Maria Edgeworth), both father and son assume captaincies among the &quot;White-boys, Oak-boys, and Hearts-of Steel&quot;, the tenant conspiracies that attack tax collectors, terrorise the landlords&#x27; agents and violently resist evictions.

This low-level agrarian warfare continued through, and beyond, the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s. It was only after this catastrophe, which as Prime Minister Moore&#x27;s Whig friend, Lord Russell, failed in any practical measure to allay, that British governments began to assume responsibility for agrarian conditions. At the time of &quot;Captain Rock&quot;&#x27;s publication (1824), the commanding issue of the day was not tenant rights or land reform. It was the final instalment of Catholic Emancipation: Castlereagh&#x27;s unredeemed promise of Catholic admission to parliament.

===&quot;Letter to the Roman Catholics of Dublin&quot;===

Since within a united kingdom, Irish Catholics would be reduced to a distinct minority, Castlereagh&#x27;s promises of their parliamentary emancipation seemed credible at the time of the Union. But the provision was stripped out of the union bills when in England the admission of Catholics to the &quot;Protestant Constitution&quot; encountered the standard objection: that as subject to political direction from Rome, Catholics could not be entrusted with the defence of constitutional liberties. Moore rallied to the &quot;liberal compromise&quot; proposed by Henry Grattan, who had moved the enfranchisement of Catholics in the old Irish parliament. Fears of &quot;Popery&quot; were to be allayed by according the Crown a &quot;negative control&quot;, a veto, on the appointment of Catholic bishops.

In an open &quot;Letter to the Roman Catholics of Dublin&quot; (1810), Moore noted that the Irish bishops (legally resident in Ireland only from 1782) had themselves been willing to comply with a practice otherwise universal in Europe. Conceding a temporal check of papal authority, he argued, was in Ireland&#x27;s Gallican tradition. In the time of &quot;her native monarchy&quot;, the Pope had had no share in the election of Irish bishops. &quot;Slavish notions of papal authority&quot; developed only as a consequence of the English conquest. The native aristocracy had sought in Rome a &quot;spiritual alliance&quot; against the new &quot;temporal tyranny&quot; at home.

In resisting royal assent and in placing &quot;their whole hierarchy at the disposal of the Roman court&quot;, Irish Catholics would &quot;unnecessarily&quot; be acting in &quot;remembrance of times, which it is the interest of all parties [Catholic and Protestant, Irish and English] to forget&quot;. Such argument made little headway against the man Moore decried as a demagogue, but who, as a result of his uncompromising stand, was to emerge as the undisputed leader of the Catholic interest in Ireland, Daniel O’Connell.

Even when, in 1814, the Curia itself (then still in silent alliance with Britain against Napoleon) proposed that bishops be &quot;personally acceptable to the king&quot;, O&#x27;Connell was opposed. Better, he declared, that Irish Catholics &quot;remain for ever without emancipation&quot; rather than allow the king and his ministers &quot;to interfere&quot; with the Pope&#x27;s appointment of Irish prelates. At stake was the unity of church and people. &quot;Licensed&quot; by the government, the bishops and their priests would be no more regarded than the ministers of the established Church of Ireland.

When final emancipation came in 1829, the price O&#x27;Connell paid was the disenfranchisement of the Forty-shilling freeholders – those who, in the decisive protest against Catholics exclusion, defied their landlords in voting O&#x27;Connell in the 1828 Clare by-election. The &quot;purity&quot; of the Irish church was sustained. Moore lived to see the exceptional papal discretion thus confirmed reshaping the Irish hierarchy culminating in 1850 with the appointment of the Rector of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in Rome, Paul Cullen, as Primate Archbishop of Armagh.

===&quot;Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion&quot;===

In a call heeded by Protestants of all denominations, in 1822 the new Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, William Magee, declared the absolute necessity of winning an Irish majority for the Reformed faith — a &quot;Second Reformation&quot;. Carrying &quot;religious tracts expressly written for the edification of the Irish peasantry&quot;, the &quot;editor&quot; of Captain Rock&#x27;s Memoirs is an English missionary in the ensuing &quot;bible war&quot;. Catholics, who coalesced behind O&#x27;Connell in the Catholic Association, believed that proselytising advantage was being sought in hunger and distress (that tenancies and food were being used to secure converts), and that the usual political interests were at play.

Moore&#x27;s narrator in &quot;Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion&quot; (1833) is again fictional. He is, as Moore had been, a Catholic student at Trinity College. On news of Emancipation (passage of the 1829 Catholic Relief Bill), he exclaims: &quot;Thank God! I may now, if I like, turn Protestant&quot;. Oppressed by the charge that Catholics are &quot;a race of obstinate and obsolete religionists […] unfit for freedom&quot;, and freed from &quot;the point of honour&quot; that would have prevented him from abandoning his church in the face of continuing sanctions, he sets out to explore the tenets of the &quot;true&quot; religion.

Predictably, the resolve the young man draws from his theological studies is to remain true to the faith of his forefathers (not to exchange &quot;the golden armour of the old Catholic Saints&quot; for &quot;heretical brass&quot;). The argument, however, was not the truth of Catholic doctrine. It was the inconsistency and fallacy of the bible preachers. Moore&#x27;s purpose, he was later to write, was to put &quot;upon record&quot; the &quot;disgust&quot; he felt at &quot;the arrogance with which most Protestant parsons assume […] credit for being the only true Christians, and the insolence with which […] they denounce all Catholics as idolators and Antichrist&quot;. Had his young man found &quot;among the Orthodox of the first [Christian] ages&quot; one &quot;particle&quot; of their rejection of the supposed &quot;corruptions&quot; of the Roman church – justification not by faith alone but also by good works, transubstantiation, and veneration of saints, relics and images — he would have been persuaded.

Moore&#x27;s work elicited an immediate riposte. The &quot;Second Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of Religion&quot; (1833) was a vindication of the reformed faith by an author described as &quot;not the editor of &quot;Captain Rock&#x27;s Memoirs&quot;&quot; — the Spanish exile and Protestant convert Joseph Blanco White.

Brendan Clifford, editor of Moore&#x27;s political writings, interprets Moore&#x27;s philosophy as &quot;cheerful paganism&quot;, or, at the very least, &quot;&quot;à la carte&quot; Catholicism&quot; favouring &quot;what scriptural Protestantism hated: the music, the theatricality, the symbolism, the idolatry&quot;. Despite his mother being a devout Catholic, and like O&#x27;Connell acknowledging Catholicism as Ireland&#x27;s &quot;national faith&quot;, Moore appears to have abandoned the formal practice of his religion as soon as he entered Trinity.

===Sheridan, Fitzgerald and &quot;The History of Ireland&quot;===
In 1825, Moore&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Richard Brinsley Sheridan&quot; was finally published after nine years of work on and off. It proved popular, went through a number of editions, and helped establish Moore&#x27;s reputation among literary critics. The work had a political aspect: Sheridan was not only a playwright, he was a Whig politician and a friend of Fox. Moore judged Sheridan an uncertain friend of reform. But he has Sheridan articulate in his own words a good part of what was to be the United Irish case for separation from England.

Writing in 1784 to his brother, Sheridan explains that the &quot;subordinate situation [of Ireland] prevents the formation of any party among us, like those you have in England, composed of person acting upon certain principles, and pledged to support each other&quot;. Without the prospect of obtaining power – which in Ireland is &quot;lodged in a branch of the English government&quot; (the Dublin Castle executive) – there is little point in the members of parliament, no matter how personally disinterested, collaborating for any public purpose. Without an accountable executive the interests of the nation are systematically neglected.

It is against this, the truncated state of politics in Ireland, that Moore sees Lord Edward Fitzgerald, a &quot;Protestant reformer&quot; who wished for &quot;a democratic House of Commons and the Emancipation of his Catholic countrymen&quot;, driven toward the republican separatism of the United Irishmen. He absolves Fitzgerald of recklessness: but for a contrary wind, decisive French assistance would have been delivered by General Hoche at Bantry in December 1796. In his own &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Moore acknowledges his &quot;Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald&quot; (1831) as a &quot;justification of the men of &#x27;98 – the &quot;ultimi Romanorum&quot; of our country&quot;.

Moore&#x27;s &quot;History of Ireland&quot;, published in four volumes between 1835 and 1846, reads as a further and extended indictment of English rule. It was an enormous work (consulted by Karl Marx in his extensive notes on Irish history), but not a critical success. Moore acknowledged scholarly failings, some of which stemmed from his inability to read documentary sources in Irish.

== On Reform and Repeal ==

=== Parliamentary reform ===
In his journal, Moore confessed that he &quot;agreed with the Tories in their opinion&quot; as to the consequences of the first Parliamentary Reform Act (1832). He believed it would give &quot;an opening and impulse to the revolutionary feeling now abroad&quot; [England, Moore suggested, had been &quot;in the stream of a revolution for some years&quot;] and that the &quot;temporary satisfaction&quot; it might produce would be but as the calm before a storm: &quot;a downward reform (as Dryden says) rolls on fast&quot;. But this was a prospect he embraced. In conversation with the Whig grandee Lord Lansdowne, he argued that while the consequences might be &quot;disagreeable&quot; for many of their friends, &quot;We have now come to that point which all highly civilised countries reach when wealth and all the advantages that attend it are so unequally distributed that the whole is in an unnatural position: and nothing short of a general routing up can remedy the evil.&quot;

Despite their initially greater opposition to reform, Moore predicted that the Tories would prove themselves better equipped to ride out this &quot;general routing&quot;. With the young Benjamin Disraeli (who was to be the author of the Second Reform Act in 1867) Moore agreed that since the Glorious Revolution first led them to court an alliance with the people against the aristocracy, the Tories had taken &quot;a more democratic line&quot;. For Moore this was evidenced by the prime-ministerial careers of George Canning and Robert Peel: &quot;mere commoners by birth could never have attained the same high station among the Whig party&quot;.

===O&#x27;Connell and Repeal===
In 1832, Moore declined a voter petition from Limerick to stand for the Westminster Parliament as a Repeal candidate. When Daniel O&#x27;Connell took this as evidence of Moore&#x27;s &quot;lukewarmness in the cause of Ireland&quot;, Moore recalled O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s praise for the &quot;treasonous truths&quot; of his book on Fitzgerald. The difficulty, Moore suggested, was that these &quot;truths&quot; did not permit him to pretend with O&#x27;Connell that reversing the Acts of Union would amount to something less than real and lasting separation from Great Britain. Relations had been difficult enough after the old Irish Parliament had secured its legislative independence from London in 1782. But with a Catholic Parliament in Dublin, &quot;which they would be sure to have out and out&quot;, the British government would be continually at odds, first over the disposal of Church of Ireland and absentee property, and then over what would be perennial issues of trade, foreign treaties and war.

So &quot;hopeless appeared the fate of Ireland under English government, whether of Whigs or Tories&quot;, that Moore declared himself willing to &quot;run the risk of Repeal, even with separation as its too certain consequence.&quot; But with Lord Fitzgerald, Moore believed independence possible only in union with the &quot;Dissenters&quot; (the Presbyterians) of the north (and possibly then, again only with a prospect of French intervention). To make &quot;headway against England&quot; the &quot;feeling&quot; of Catholics and Dissenters had first to be &quot;nationalised&quot;. This is something Moore thought might be achieved by fixing upon the immediate abuses of the (Anglican and landed) &quot;Irish establishment&quot;. As he had O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s uncompromising stance on the Veto, Moore regarded O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s campaign for Repeal as unhelpful or, at best, &quot;premature&quot;.

This perspective was shared by some of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s younger lieutenants, dissidents with the Repeal Association. Young Irelander Charles Gavan Duffy sought to build a &quot;League of North and South&quot; around what Michael Davitt (of the later Land League) described as &quot;the programme of the Whiteboys and Ribbonmen reduced to moral and constitutional standards&quot;—tenant rights and land reform.

==&quot;Irish Melodies&quot;==
===Reception===

In the early years of his career, Moore&#x27;s work was largely generic, and had he died at this point he would likely not have been considered an Irish poet. From 1806 to 1807, Moore dramatically changed his style of writing and focus. Following a request by the publishers James and William Power, he wrote lyrics to a series of Irish tunes in the manner of Haydn&#x27;s settings of British folksongs, with Sir John Andrew Stevenson as arranger of the music. The principal source for the tunes was Edward Bunting&#x27;s &quot;A General Collection of the Ancient Irish Music&quot; (1797) to which Moore had been introduced at Trinity by Edward Hudson. The &quot;Melodies&quot; was published in ten volumes, together with a supplement, over 26 years between 1808 and 1834. The musical arrangements of the last volumes, following Stevenson&#x27;s death in 1833, were by Henry Bishop.

The &quot;Melodies&quot; were an immediate success, &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot;, &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot;, &quot;Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Young Dream&quot;, and &quot;Oft in the Stilly Night&quot; becoming immensely popular. There were parodies in England, but translations into German, Italian, Hungarian, Czech, and French, and settings by Hector Berlioz guaranteed a large European audience. In the United States, &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot; alone sold more than a million copies.

Byron said he knew them all &quot;by rote and by heart&quot;; setting them above epics and Moore above all other poets for his &quot;peculiarity of talent, or rather talents, – poetry, music, voice, all his own&quot;. They were also praised by Sir Walter Scott who conceded that neither he nor Byron could attain Moore&#x27;s power of adapting words to music. Moore was in no doubt that the &quot;Irish Melodies&quot; would be &quot;the only work of my pen […] whose fame (thanks to the sweet music in which it is embalmed) may boast a chance of prolonging its existence to a day much beyond our own&quot;.

===Ireland&#x27;s &quot;national music&quot;===
The &quot;ultra-Tory&quot; &quot;The Anti-Jacobin Review&quot; (&quot;Monthly Political and Literary Censor&quot;) discerned in Moore&#x27;s &quot;Melodies&quot; something more than innocuous drawing-room ballads: &quot;several of them were composed in a very disordered state of society, if not in open rebellion. They are the melancholy ravings of the disappointed rebel, or his ill-educated offspring&quot;. Moore was providing texts to what he described as &quot;our national music&quot;, and his lyrics did often &quot;reflect an unmistakable intimation of dispossession and loss in the music itself&quot;.

Despite Moore&#x27;s difficult relationship with O&#x27;Connell, in the early 1840s his &quot;Melodies&quot; were employed in the &quot;Liberator&#x27;s&quot; renewed campaign for Repeal. The Repeal Association&#x27;s monster meetings (crowds of over 100,000) were usually followed by public banquets. At Mallow, County Cork, before the dinner speeches, a singer performed Moore&#x27;s &quot;Where Is the Slave?&quot;: Oh, where&#x27;s the slave so lowly, Condemned to chains unholy, Who could be burst His bonds accursed, Would die beneath them slowly? O&#x27;Connell leapt to his feet, threw his arms wide and cried &quot;I am not that slave!&quot; All the room followed: &quot;We are not those slaves! We are not those slaves!&quot;

In the greatest meeting of all, at the Hill of Tara (by tradition the inaugural seat of the High Kings of Ireland), on the feast-day of the Assumption, 15 August 1843, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s carriage proceeded through a crowd, reportedly of a million, accompanied by a harpist playing Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Harp that once through Tara&#x27;s Halls&quot;.

=== Later criticism and reappraisal ===
Some critics detected a tone of national resignation and defeatism in Moore&#x27;s lyrics: a &quot;whining lamentation over our eternal fall, and miserable appeals to our masters to regard us with pity&quot;. William Hazlitt observed that &quot;if Moore&#x27;s &quot;Irish Melodies&quot; with their drawing-room, lackadaisical, patriotism were really the melodies of the Irish nation, the Irish people deserve to be slaves forever&quot;. Moore, in Hazlitt&#x27;s view had &quot;convert[ed] the wild harp of Erin into a musical snuff box&quot;. It was a judgement later generations of Irish writers appeared to share.

In &quot;A&quot; &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, as he passes &quot;the droll statue of the national poet of Ireland&quot; in College Street, James Joyce&#x27;s biographic protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, remarks on the figure&#x27;s &quot;servile head&quot;. Yet in his father&#x27;s house, Dedalus is moved when he hears his younger brothers and sisters singing Moore&#x27;s &quot;Oft in the Stilly Night&quot;. Despite Joyce&#x27;s occasional expressions of disdain for the bard, critic Emer Nolan suggests that the writer responded to the &quot;element of utopian longing as well as the sentimental nostalgia&quot; in Moore&#x27;s music. In &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, Joyce has occasion to allude to virtually every one of the &quot;Melodies.&quot;

While acknowledging that his own sense of an Irish past was &quot;woven . . . out of Moore&#x27;s &quot;Melodies&quot;,&quot; in a 1979 tribute to Moore, Seamus Heaney remarked that Ireland had rescinded Moore&#x27;s title of national bard because his characteristic tone was &#x27;&quot;too light, too conciliatory, too colonisé&quot; for a nation &quot;whose conscience was being forged by James Joyce, whose tragic disunity was being envisaged by W.B. Yeats and whose literary tradition was being restored by the repossession of voices such as Aodhagán O Rathaille&#x27;s or Brian Merriman&#x27;s&quot;.

More recently, there has been a reappraisal sympathetic to Moore&#x27;s &quot;strategies of disguise, concealment and historical displacement so necessary for an Irish Catholic patriot who regularly sang songs to London glitterati about Irish suffering and English &#x27;bigotry and misrule&#x27;&quot;. The political content of the &quot;Melodies&quot; and their connections to the United Irishmen and to the death of Emmet have been discussed in Ronan Kelly&#x27;s biography of the poet, &quot;Bard of Erin&quot; (2008), by Mary Helen Thuente in &quot;The Harp Restrung: the United Irishmen and the Rise of Literary Nationalism&quot; (1994); and by Una Hunt in &quot;Literary Relationship of Lord Byron and Thomas Moore&quot; (2001).

Eóin MacWhite and Kathleen O&#x27;Donnell have found that the political undertone of the &quot;Melodies&quot; and of other of Moore&#x27;s works was readily appreciated by dissidents in the imperial realms of eastern Europe. Greek-Rumanian conspirators against the Sultan, Russian Decembrists and, above all, Polish intellectuals recognised in the Gothic elements of the &quot;Melodies&quot;, &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; (“a dramatization of Irish patriotism in an Eastern parable”) and &quot;Captain Rock&quot; (all of which found translators) &quot;a cloak of culture and fraternity&quot;.

==Byron&#x27;s Memoirs==
Moore was much criticised by contemporaries for allowing himself to be persuaded, on the grounds of their indelicacy, to destroy Byron&#x27;s Memoirs. Modern scholarship assigns the blame elsewhere.

In 1821, with Byron&#x27;s blessing, Moore sold the manuscript, with which Byron had entrusted him three years before, to the publisher John Murray. Although he himself allowed that it contained some &quot;very coarse things&quot;, when, following Bryon&#x27;s death in 1824, Moore learned that Murray had deemed the material unfit for publication he spoke of settling the matter with a duel. But the combination of Byron&#x27;s wife Lady Byron, half-sister and executor Augusta Leigh and Moore&#x27;s rival in Byron&#x27;s friendship John Cam Hobhouse prevailed. In what some were to call the greatest literary crime in history, in Moore&#x27;s presence the family solicitors tore up all extant copies of the manuscript and burned them in Murray&#x27;s fireplace.

With the assistance of papers provided by Mary Shelley, Moore retrieved what he could. His &quot;Letters and Journals of Lord Byron: With Notices of His Life&quot; (1830) &quot;contrived&quot;, in the view of Macaulay, &quot;to exhibit so much of the character and opinions of his friend, with so little pain to the feelings of the living&quot;. Lady Byron still professed herself scandalised—as did &quot;The Times&quot;.

With Byron an inspiration, Moore previously published a collection of songs, &quot;Evenings in Greece&quot;, (1826) and, set in 3rd-century Egypt, his only prose novel &quot;The Epicurean&quot; (1827). Supplying a demand for &quot;semi-erotic romance tinged with religiosity&quot; it was a popular success.

==1844 photograph by Henry Fox Talbot==

Moore stands in the centre of a calotype dated April 1844.

Moore is pictured with members of the household of William Henry Fox Talbot, the photographer. Talbot, a pioneer of photography (the inventor of the salted paper and calotype processes) was Moore&#x27;s neighbour in Wiltshire. It is possible that the lady to the lower right of Moore is his wife Bessy Moore.

To the left of Moore stands Henrietta Horatia Maria Fielding (1809–1851), a close friend of the Moores, Talbot&#x27;s half-sister and the daughter of Rear-Admiral Charles Fielding.

Moore took an early interest in Talbot&#x27;s photogenic drawings. Talbot, in turn, took images of Moore&#x27;s hand-written poetry possibly for inclusion in facsimile in an edition of &quot;The Pencil of Nature,&quot; the first commercially published book to be illustrated with photographs.

==Death==
It is a criticism of Moore that he &quot;wrote too much and catered too deliberately to his audiences&quot;. In his lyrics there is a bathos that speaks both to a love of recitation and to an abiding sense of tragedy that is perhaps lost on the modern reader. 
Oft, in the stilly night,
Ere slumber&#x27;s chain has bound me,
Fond memory brings the light
Of other days around me;
The smiles, the tears,
Of boyhood&#x27;s years,
The words of love then spoken;
The eyes that shone,
Now dimm&#x27;d and gone,
The cheerful hearts now broken!...

When I remember all
The friends, so link&#x27;d together,
I’ve seen around me fall,
Like leaves in wintry weather;
I feel like one
Who treads alone
Some banquet-hall deserted,
Whose lights are fled,
Whose garlands dead,
And all but he departed!...
In the late 1840s (and as the catastrophe of the Great Famine overtook Ireland), Moore&#x27;s powers began to fail. He was reduced ultimately to senility, which came suddenly in December 1849. Moore died on 25 February 1852, preceded by all his children and by most of his friends and companions.

After the deaths of his wife and five children, Moore died in his seventy-third year and was buried in Bromham churchyard within view of his cottage home, and beside his daughter Anastasia (who had died aged 17), near Devizes in Wiltshire.

His epitaph at his St. Nicholas churchyard grave is inscribed:

Moore had appointed as his literary executor&quot;,&quot; Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who, just four days before Moore&#x27;s death, had ended his first term as Prime Minister. Russell dutifully published Moore&#x27;s papers in accordance with his late friend&#x27;s wishes. The &quot;Memoirs, Journal, and Correspondence of Thomas Moore&quot; appeared in eight volumes, published between 1853 and 1856.

==Commemoration==

Moore is often considered Ireland&#x27;s national bard and to be to Ireland what Robert Burns is to Scotland. Moore is commemorated in several places: by a plaque on the house where he was born, by busts at The Meetings and Central Park, New York, and by a bronze statue near Trinity College Dublin. There is a road in Walkinstown, Dublin, named Thomas Moore Road, in a series of roads named after famous composers, locally referred to as the Musical Roads.
* Many composers have set the poems of Thomas Moore to music. They include Ludwig van Beethoven, Gaspare Spontini, Robert Schumann, Friedrich von Flotow, Felix Mendelssohn, Hector Berlioz, Charles Ives, William Bolcom, Benjamin Britten, and Henri Duparc.
* As noted above (Irish Melodies / Later criticism and reappraisal), many songs of Thomas Moore are cited in works of James Joyce, for example &quot;Silent, O Moyle&quot; in &quot;Two Gallants&quot; (&quot;Dubliners&quot;) or &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot;.
* Irish American scholar, singer and critic James W. Flannery (born 1936) is widely recognized as a skilled interpreter of Thomas Moore&#x27;s art songs. In 1997 he released a book and recording named &quot;Dear Harp of My Country: The Irish Melodies of Thomas Moore&quot;.
* Oliver Onions quotes Moore&#x27;s poem &quot;Oft in the Stilly Night&quot; in his 1910 ghost story &quot;The Cigarette Case&quot;. It is also referenced in Bob Shaw&#x27;s 1966 science-fiction story &quot;Light of Other Days&quot;.
* The earliest known photograph taken by a woman (Constance Fox Talbot) is an albeit somewhat unclear image of a few lines from one of his poems.
* Letitia Elizabeth Landon offers a tribute in her poem &quot;Thomas Moore, Esq.&quot;, in Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot;, 1839.

* Edna O&#x27;Brien wrote a short story entitled &quot;Oft in the Stilly Night&quot; in her 1990 story collection &quot;Lantern Slides&quot;.

==In fiction==
The character Tickle Tommy in &quot;John Paterson&#x27;s Mare&quot;, James Hogg&#x27;s allegorical satire on the Edinburgh publishing scene first published in the &quot;Newcastle Magazine&quot; in 1825, is based on Thomas Moore. Percy French wrote several parodic versions of Moore&#x27;s melodies in a comic paper he edited for two years &quot;The Jarvey&quot;, including at least six versions of &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot;. &quot;are in The Jarvey&quot;. He also parodied Moore in his stage shows. As noted above, Moore and his melodies also figure in the works of James Joyce: &quot;A&quot; &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; and &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;

<text>The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, commonly known simply as Middle Temple, is one of the four Inns of Court entitled to call their members to the English Bar as barristers, the others being the Inner Temple (with which it shares Temple Church), Gray&#x27;s Inn and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. It is located in the wider Temple area of London, near the Royal Courts of Justice, and within the City of London. As a liberty, it functions largely as an independent local government authority.

== History ==
During the 12th and early 13th centuries the law was taught, in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. But a papal bull in 1218 prohibited the clergy from practising in the secular courts (where the English common law system operated, as opposed to the Roman civil law favoured by the Church). As a result, law began to be practised and taught by laymen instead of by clerics. To protect their schools from competition, first Henry II and later Henry III issued proclamations prohibiting the teaching of the civil law within the City of London. The common law lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, as it was easy to get to the law courts at Westminster Hall and was just outside the City. They were based in guilds, which in time became the Inns of Court.

The Middle Temple is the western part of &quot;The Temple&quot;, which was the headquarters of the Knights Templar until they were dissolved in 1312. There have been lawyers in the Temple since 1320, when they were the tenants of the Earl of Lancaster, who had held the Temple since 1315. The Temple later belonged to the Knights Hospitaller. In 1346 the knights again leased the premises to the lawyers – the eastern part (which became Inner Temple) to lawyers from Thavie&#x27;s Inn, an Inn of Chancery in Holborn, and the western part to lawyers from St George&#x27;s Inn. The Cross of St George is still part of the arms of Middle Temple today.

All of the Inn&#x27;s records were burned during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381.

After Henry VIII seized the Temple from the Knights Hospitaller in 1540, each Inn continued to hold its share of the Temple as tenants of the Crown for £10 a year, until it was granted to them jointly in 1608 by James I, to be held in perpetuity so long as they continue to provide education and accommodation to lawyers and students and maintain the Temple Church and its Master. The Temple Church, consecrated in 1185, still stands as a &quot;Royal Peculiar&quot; (extra-diocesan) church of the Inner and Middle Temples.
Much of the Middle Temple was destroyed in a fire in January 1679, which caused more damage to the Inn than the Great Fire of 1666. The Thames being frozen over, beer from the Temple cellars was used to fight the fire, which was eventually only contained by blowing up some buildings with gunpowder. The Lord Mayor of London tried to exploit the occasion to assert his own jurisdiction over the Temple – which was independent of the City – and on being thwarted in this endeavour, he turned back a fire engine which was on its way to the fire from the City. Issues related to the destruction of records of the Office of the Chirographer of Fines of the Court of Common Pleas, held at Middle Temple, had to be resolved by an act of Parliament, the (31 Cha. 2. c. 3)

The first woman to be admitted to any Inn was Helena Florence Normanton, who joined Middle Temple as a student member on 24 December 1919. Olive Clapham, who joined Middle Temple on 17 January 1920, became the first woman to pass the bar finals examinations in May 1921.

The Temple was damaged extensively during the Blitz (1940–1944). The Library was destroyed, much of the Church was destroyed, the Master&#x27;s House burned down, and the Hall was badly damaged. 112 chambers were destroyed, out of a pre-war total of 285 (39%).

The Inns served as colleges for the education of lawyers until they stopped being responsible for legal education in 1852, although they continue to provide training in areas such as advocacy and ethics for students, pupil barristers and newly qualified barristers. Most of the Inn is occupied by barristers&#x27; offices, known as barristers&#x27; chambers. One of the Middle Temple&#x27;s main functions now is to provide education and support to new members of the profession. This is done through advocacy training, the provision of scholarships (over £1 million in 2011), subsidised accommodation both in the Temple and in Clapham, and by providing events where junior members may meet senior colleagues for help and advice.

In 2008 the 400th anniversary of the charter of James I was celebrated by Elizabeth II issuing new letters patent confirming the original grant.

== Buildings ==

The Middle Temple owns 43 buildings, many of which are listed buildings. The ones in the Temple itself are still held under the 1608 letters patent of James I, but some others just outside the Temple were bought subsequently. Some buildings are modern, replacing ones which were destroyed in The Blitz, but others date back to the 16th century. (There is a list here, showing the dates of construction, architect, and listed status.) The Inn is also jointly responsible, with Inner Temple, for Temple Church and the Master&#x27;s House next to the church, a Georgian townhouse built in 1764.

=== The Hall ===

Construction of Middle Temple Hall began in 1562 and was completed in the early 1570s. Its hammerbeam roof has been said to be the best in London. Queen Elizabeth I visited the hall in 1578, unannounced, to inspect the new building and listen to a debate between barristers. This is the earliest known visit of a reigning monarch to an Inn of Court. One of the tables at the end of the hall is traditionally said to have been made from the timbers of the &quot;Golden Hinde&quot;, the ship used by Sir Francis Drake to circumnavigate the world. Above the table is a massive painting of King Charles I thought to be a copy by Peter Lely of the original by Anthony van Dyck, and also portraits of Charles II, James II, William III, Elizabeth I, Queen Anne and George I. On the walls are panels bearing the coats of arms of Readers (senior members) dating back to 1597.

The first recorded performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; occurred in the hall on 2 February 1602. Shakespeare himself was probably present.

The hall survived the Great Fire of London in 1666, but was damaged by bombing in the Second World War.

Middle Temple Hall is at the heart of the Inn, hosting several events per year for members of the Inn (and sometimes their guests), some of which also count as qualifying sessions for student members.

Middle Temple Hall is also a popular venue for banqueting, weddings, receptions and parties. In recent years, it has become a much-used film location, as has Middle Temple generally, because of its cobbled streets, historic buildings and gas lighting.

=== Library ===
Little is known about the original library, which was probably just a room in a barristers&#x27; chambers. All the books were stolen prior to the reign of Henry VIII. In 1625 a new library was established at the site of what is now Garden Court, and in 1641 it was enlarged when a member of the Inn, Robert Ashley, died and left his collection of books and £300 to the Inn. This library was demolished in 1830. After an interval of three decades, a new library was built, in a Gothic style designed by architect H. R. Abraham. It was opened by The Prince of Wales on 31 October 1861. This Victorian library was badly damaged during the London Blitz in 1940, and was demolished following the war. A new Library was constructed in the 1950s to a design by Edward Maufe and opened by the Queen Mother in 1958. The building still houses the Inn&#x27;s library and archives as well as various administrative offices, and is now known as the Ashley Building.

Middle Temple Library possesses Emery Molyneux&#x27;s terrestrial and celestial globes, which are of particular historical cartographical value.

=== Gatehouse ===

The present gatehouse, on Fleet Street on the northern boundary of the Inn, was built in 1684 by Sir Christopher Wren. It replaced an earlier one which had been allowed to decay until it had to be demolished. It leads into Middle Temple Lane, which proceeds southwards through the Inn to end at gates on the Victoria Embankment, south of the Temple. All of the buildings in the Temple lying west of the lane belong to Middle Temple; the buildings to the east belong to one Inn or the other.

=== Chambers ===
==== West of Middle Temple Lane ====

Proceeding south from the Fleet Street gatehouse, Middle Temple Lane passes Brick Court to the west, so called because it is said to consist of the first brick buildings to be built in the Temple, in the reign of Elizabeth I. Sir William Blackstone worked here before becoming the first professor to lecture in law at Oxford University. The poet and playwright Oliver Goldsmith also lived here from 1765 (having earlier resided in Garden Court), and is buried in the Temple Church. Blackstone, living on the floor below Goldsmith&#x27;s chambers, complained about the noise made by Goldsmith&#x27;s raucous parties, which were attended by many celebrities of the time, including Samuel Johnson. Blackstone later moved to Pump Court; whether because of the parties or for some other reason is unknown.

Next to Brick Court are the buildings called Essex Court, which actually form part of the same courtyard. The earliest record of Essex Court is from 1640, but the original buildings were replaced in 1656 and 1677. Today Essex Court and Brick Court are occupied by barristers&#x27; chambers. Through a passageway to the west is New Court, built by Wren, and a gate leading out of the Temple into Devereux Court and Essex Street. (Another passageway to the north leads through Outer Temple to Fleet Street.)
South of New Court and Essex Court lies Fountain Court. The fountain there was described by Charles Dickens in &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. In her notes to her poem &quot;The Middle Temple Gardens&quot;, Letitia Elizabeth Landon says of it: &#x27;it is the poetry of the place, or, rather, the voice of the poetry with which it is filled&#x27;. To the south of Fountain Court are, from west to east, Garden Court (where the old library used to be), Middle Temple Gardens (which extend to the southern perimeter of the Temple), and Middle Temple Hall. The current buildings of Garden Court, which lie along the western edge of the Temple, were constructed in 1883. South of Garden Court are Blackstone House, Queen Elizabeth Building, and a gate leading out of the Temple (and a short distance from Temple tube station).

South of the hall, and east of the gardens, are Plowden Buildings, built in 1831, which contain the Treasurer&#x27;s office. South of that is the current library, and then, at the end of Middle Temple Lane, are the buildings called Temple Gardens, built on both sides of the lane by both Inns in 1861. The western part belongs to Middle Temple, and the eastern part is Inner Temple&#x27;s. The lane passes through the middle of Temple Gardens via an archway and leads out of the Temple.

==== East of the lane ====

Along the east side of Middle Temple Lane (proceeding northwards from the southern archway), the buildings belong to Inner Temple, until the lane reaches Lamb Buildings. Lamb Buildings belong to Middle Temple, which bought the land from Inner Temple after the Great Fire of 1666. Inner Temple needed the money because it found itself short of funds due to the extensive property destruction. Lamb Buildings are built on the site of Caesar&#x27;s Buildings, which were destroyed in the fire, and which had belonged to Inner Temple. The Lamb of God is the symbol of Middle Temple and is engraved above the entrances to the building.

Behind Lamb Buildings, further east, is Elm Court, built in 1880. The buildings on the south and east sides of Elm Court are part of Inner Temple; the west and north buildings are Middle Temple. Further north is Pump Court, one of the oldest courts in the Temple. Most of the buildings here belong to Middle Temple, except those in the north west corner. Further east are Middle Temple&#x27;s cloisters, leading to Church Court between Temple Church and Inner Temple Hall. North of Pump Court is Inner Temple&#x27;s Hare Court, and then more buildings belonging to Middle Temple, until the lane ends at the gate to Fleet Street.

Parallel with and to the east of Middle Temple Lane lies Inner Temple Lane, which runs from Fleet Street to Church Court. On the east side of Inner Temple Lane, and opposite Hare Court, is Goldsmith Building, so named because of its proximity to Goldsmith&#x27;s tomb in the adjacent Temple Church. Despite its location in the Inner Temple, Goldsmith Building actually belongs to Middle Temple, for reasons which are no longer remembered. It was built in 1861.

== Structure and governance ==

The Inn&#x27;s supreme body is its Parliament, which is made up of the Benchers (judges and senior barristers), who are elected for life, and headed by the Treasurer who is elected annually. Parliament approves the Inn&#x27;s budget and authorises Call of qualified student members to the Bar. Members of the British royal family who are made honorary benchers are known as &quot;Royal Benchers&quot;. The first of these was the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, who was made a Royal Bencher when he opened the newly constructed library in 1861.

The Inn is run from day to day by an Executive Committee and five Standing Committees, which are accountable to the Parliament. The Executive Committee consists of nine voting members (including the Treasurer and the Deputy Treasurer) and six non-voting members (including the Under Treasurer).

The Treasurer for 2024 was Paul Darling OBE KC, who died on 2 August 2024; he is succeeded by the former Deputy Treasurer, Dame Kathryn Thirlwall DBE. The Chief Executive and Under Treasurer is Christopher Ghika KCVO CBE.

=== Liberty ===

Middle Temple (like the Inner Temple) is one of the few remaining liberties, an old name for a geographic division. It is an independent extra-parochial area, historically not governed by the City of London Corporation (and is today regarded as a local authority for most purposes) and equally outside the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Bishop of London. The Middle Temple&#x27;s functions as a local council are set out in the Temples Order 1971.

It geographically falls within the boundaries and wards of the City.

Some of the Inn&#x27;s buildings (those along Essex Street, Devereux Court and the Queen Elizabeth Building near the Embankment) lie just outside the liberty of the Middle Temple and the City&#x27;s boundary, and are actually situated in the City of Westminster. Quadrant House (7–15 Fleet Street) was acquired by the Middle Temple in 1999, and after five years of conversion is now a barristers&#x27; chambers. This lies outside the liberty (though immediately adjacent to it) but is within the City of London.

=== Badge and coat of arms ===

The badge of the Middle Temple consists of the Lamb of God with a flag bearing the Saint George&#x27;s Cross. This symbol appears in the centre of the Inn&#x27;s coat of arms, against a background consisting of the same cross (a red cross on a white field). The cross, and the lamb with the flag, each were symbols of the Knights Templar.

== Qualifying sessions ==
The Inn&#x27;s student members are required to attend a minimum of 10 qualifying sessions, 6 of which must be attended in person, either at the Inn or &quot;on circuit&quot; (outside London). Qualifying sessions, formerly known as &quot;dinners&quot;, combine collegiate and educational elements and will usually combine a dinner or reception with lectures, debates, mooting, or musical performances, often taking place in The Hall.

<doc id="162636" wikidata="Q5203686" url="?curid=162636" title="D. K. Broster">
<text>Dorothy Kathleen Broster (2 September 1877 – 7 February 1950), usually known as D. K. Broster, was an English novelist and short-story writer. Her fiction consists mainly of historical romances set in the 18th or early 19th centuries. Her best known novel is &quot;The Flight of the Heron&quot; (1925), set during the Jacobite rising of 1745.

==Biography==
Dorothy Kathleen Broster was born on 2 September 1877, to Thomas Mawdsley Broster and Emilie Kathleen Gething, at Devon Lodge (now Monksferry House) in Grassendale Park, Garston, Liverpool, on the banks of the Mersey. &quot;And to this she probably owed her life-long interest in the sea.&quot; When she was 16, the family moved to Cheltenham, where she attended Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College. From 1896 to 1898 she read history at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she was one of the first students, although at this date women were not awarded degrees.

Broster served as secretary to Charles Harding Firth, (Regius Professor of History from 1904 to 1925) for several years, and collaborated on several of his works. Her first two novels were co-written with a college friend, Gertrude Winifred Taylor: &quot;Chantemerle: A Romance of the Vendean War&quot; (1911) and &quot;The Vision Splendid&quot; (1913) (about the Tractarian Movement).

During the First World War she served as a Red Cross nurse with a voluntary Franco-American hospital, but she returned to England with a knee infection in 1916. After the war, she and a friend, Gertrude Schlich (daughter of Wilhelm Philipp Daniel Schlich, first professor of forestry at Oxford), moved near to Battle, East Sussex, where Broster worked full-time as a writer. She was in the first batch of women to receive her Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in 1920 at Oxford.

&quot;The Yellow Poppy&quot; (1920), about the adventures of an aristocratic couple during the French Revolution, was later adapted by Broster and W. Edward Stirling for the London stage in 1922. She produced her bestseller about Scottish history, &quot;The Flight of the Heron&quot;, in 1925. Broster stated she had consulted eighty reference books before beginning the novel. She followed it up with two successful sequels, &quot;The Gleam in the North&quot; and &quot;The Dark Mile&quot;. She wrote several other historical novels, much reprinted in their day, although this Jacobite trilogy, inspired by a five-week visit to friends in Scotland and featuring the dashing Ewen Cameron as hero, remains the best known.

During her career, Broster wrote several poems, articles and, notably, short stories, which were collected in &quot;A Fire of Driftwood&quot; and &quot;Couching at the Door&quot;. The title story of &quot;Couching at the Door&quot; involves an artist haunted by a mysterious entity. Other supernatural tales include &quot;Clairvoyance&quot;, (1932) about a psychic girl, &quot;Juggernaut&quot; (1935) about a haunted chair, and &quot;The Pestering&quot;, (1932) focusing on a couple tormented by a supernatural entity. In 2022, a collection of eleven stories entitled &quot;From the Abyss&quot; was published by Handheld Press (Bath UK), edited by Melissa Edmundson.

Broster avoided personal publicity. During her lifetime, many of her readers wrongly assumed she was both male and Scottish. She died in Bexhill Hospital on 7 February 1950, aged 73.

==Critical reception==
Literary historian Jack Adrian describes &quot;Couching at the Door&quot; as &quot;a pure masterwork, one of the most satisfying weird collections of the century&quot;. The poet Patricia Beer was an admirer of Broster&#x27;s novels, stating she had been fascinated by &quot;The Flight of the Heron&quot; when she read it aged thirteen.

&quot;The Flight of the Heron&quot; was adapted for BBC Radio twice, in 1944 (starring Gordon Jackson as Ewen Cameron) and again in 1959, starring (Bryden Murdoch as Cameron). Murdoch also starred in radio adaptations of the book&#x27;s sequels, &quot;The Gleam in the North&quot; and &quot;The Dark Mile&quot;.

The supernatural tale &quot;The Pestering&quot; was also adapted for radio. &quot;The Flight of the Heron&quot; was serialized on TV twice: by Scottish Television in eight episodes in 1968, and by the BBC in 1976, which starred David Rintoul as Ewen Cameron and Tom Chadbon as Keith Windham.

<text>Dulwich College is a 2–18 private, day and boarding school for boys in Dulwich, London, England. As a public school, it began as the College of God&#x27;s Gift, founded in 1619 by Elizabethan actor Edward Alleyn, with the original purpose of educating 12 poor scholars. It began to grow into a large school from 1857 and took its current form in 1870, when it moved into its current premises.

Admission by examination is mainly into years 3, 7, 9, and 12 (i.e. ages 7, 11, 13, and 16 years old) to the Junior, Lower, Middle and Upper Schools into which the college is divided. It is a member of both the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference and the Eton Group.

In the 2023 A-levels, the school saw 64.8% of its candidates score A*/A. The school is included in The Schools Index as one of the 150 best private schools in the world and among the top 30 senior schools in the UK.

==History==

===1619: The College of God&#x27;s Gift===
On 21 June 1619, the College of God&#x27;s Gift was established in Dulwich by Edward Alleyn with the signing letters patent by James I. The term &quot;Dulwich College&quot; was used colloquially from that date, such as in 1675 when John Evelyn described his visit to Dulwich College in his &quot;Diary&quot;. However, for at least 263 years this colloquialism was incorrect as the school was part of the overall charitable Foundation. Edward Alleyn, as well as being a famous Elizabethan actor, for whom Christopher Marlowe wrote his title roles, performed at the Rose Theatre, was also a man of great property and wealth, derived mainly from places of entertainment including theatres and bear-gardens. There is no documentary evidence for the legend that he owned brothels. He was &quot;Chief Maister, Ruler and Overseer of [the King&#x27;s] games of Beares, Bulls, Mastiff Dogs and Mastiff Bitches&quot;. Allegations that Alleyn turned his attention towards charitable pursuits out of have been traced to the 19th-century journalist George Sala and questioned, though never firmly answered in the negative.

Since 1605, Alleyn had owned the manorial estate of Dulwich, and it may have been around this time that he first had the idea of establishing a college or hospital for poor people and the education of poor boys. The building on Dulwich Green of a chapel, a schoolhouse and twelve almshouses began in 1613 and was completed in the autumn of 1616. On 1 September 1616 the chapel was consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who became the official Visitor. However, Edward Alleyn faced objections from Francis Bacon, the Lord Chancellor, in getting the patent of incorporation that was necessary to secure the Foundation&#x27;s status as a college. It was Alleyn&#x27;s persistence that led to the foundation being endowed by James I&#x27;s signing of the letters patent.

The charity originally consisted of a Master, Warden, four fellows, six poor brothers, six poor sisters and twelve poor scholars (orphans admitted from the age of six years), who became the joint legal owners of Alleyn&#x27;s endowment of the manor and lands of Dulwich, collectively known as the Members of the College. The poor brothers and sisters and scholars were to be drawn from the four parishes that were most closely tied to Alleyn (being St Botolph&#x27;s Bishopsgate where he was born, St Giles, Middlesex where he had built his Fortune Theatre, St Saviour&#x27;s Southwark where he had the Paris Bear Garden and had managed the Rose Theatre, and St Giles Camberwell where the college was founded). The business of the charity was conducted in the name of these 30 members by the Master, Warden and four Fellows (Chaplain, Schoolmaster, Usher and Organist).

Alleyn drew upon the experience of other similar establishments in order to formulate the statutes and ordinances of the college, including drawing on the statutes of the already ancient Winchester College and visiting the more contemporary establishments of Sutton&#x27;s Hospital (now Charterhouse School) and Croydon&#x27;s Hospital (now the almshouses of the Whitgift Foundation). Among the many statutes and ordinances signed by Alleyn that pertained to the charitable scheme were provisions that the scholars &quot;w&quot;ere &quot;entitled to stay until they were eighteen&quot;. And &quot;to be taught in good and sound learning ... that they might be prepared for university or for good and sweet trades and occupations&quot;. Another stipulation was that the Master and Warden should always be unmarried and of Alleyn&#x27;s blood, and surname, and if the former was impossible then at least of Alleyn&#x27;s surname. Alleyn also made provision that the people of Dulwich should be able to have their &quot;men children&quot; instructed at the school for a fee as well as children from outside Dulwich for a separate fee.

The next two centuries were beset by both external difficulties such as diminishing financial fortunes and failing buildings as well as internal strife between the various Members of the College. The Official Visitor, the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose function was to ensure that the statutes were obeyed, was called in many times. The lack of a disinterested body of governors and of any official connection to the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge contributed significantly to the school failing to fulfill Alleyn&#x27;s vision in its first two centuries. Some notable Masters did preside over the college during this time, including James Allen (the first Master to drop the &#x27;y&#x27; from his surname), who in 1741 made over to the college six houses in Kensington, the rents of which were to be used in the establishment of two small schools in Dulwich, one for boys from the village, the other for girls to read and sew, out of which James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School (JAGS) arose. Dr John Allen (1771–1843) of Holland House was a most learned and influential man, but neglected the education of the Poor Scholars.

Having already obtained an Act in 1805 allowing them to enclose and develop of common land within the manor, the college was granted the power by the 1808 Dulwich College Building Act to extend the period over which leases ran, from 21 years as laid down by Alleyn, to 84 years, thus attracting richer tenants and bringing in large sums of money. The increased wealth of the college eventually resulted in the Charity Commission establishment of an enquiry into the advisability of widening the application of the funds to those extra beneficiaries Alleyn had specified in later amended clauses to the foundation&#x27;s original statutes. Although the Master of the Rolls, Lord Langdale, rejected the appeal in 1841 on the grounds that Alleyn had no right to alter the original statutes, he did express dissatisfaction with the college&#x27;s educational provision.

Immediately after this criticism, the Dulwich College Grammar School was established in 1842 for the education of poor boys from Dulwich and Camberwell. To this school were transferred the boys of the James Allen Foundation, leaving James Allen&#x27;s school for girls only. The Old Grammar School, as it became known, was erected in 1841 opposite the Old College, designed by Sir Charles Barry, the architect of the Palace of Westminster. It still exists today. The foundation scholars of the college continued to receive an education far short of Alleyn&#x27;s vision, despite further attempts at reform by the Visitor. In 1854, the college was investigated by a new Commission set up by the 1853 Charitable Trusts Act, which led to the 1857 Dulwich College Act.

===1857: The &quot;Upper School&quot; of Alleyn&#x27;s College of God&#x27;s Gift===

The &quot;College of God&#x27;s Gift&quot; became &quot;Alleyn&#x27;s College of God&#x27;s Gift&quot; when, on 25 August 1857, the Dulwich College Act 1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. 84) dissolved the existing corporation and the charity was reconstituted with the new name. It was split into two parts with a joint Board of Governors: the &quot;educational&quot; (for the college) and the &quot;eleemosynary&quot; (for the charity). The Master, Warden, four fellows and 12 servants were pensioned off, although Alleyn&#x27;s wishes were, and continue to be, respected, as sixteen pensioners (being the equivalent of 12 poor brothers and sisters plus four fellows) still live in flats in the Old College, looked after by a Warden. As for the Master, he was still to be appointed as the head of the new school.

In its new form, the Master of the College was Reverend Alfred Carver (Master from April 1857 to April 1883). Carver successfully fought with the Chairman of the Governors, the Rev William Rogers, to create a public school with high academic standards. He was the first Master not to share the name of the school&#x27;s founder &quot;Alleyn&quot; (or latterly &quot;Allen&quot;). The educational college was split into an &quot;Upper&quot; and &quot;Lower&quot; school. The &quot;Upper school&quot; was for boys between 8 and 18, to be taught a wide and detailed syllabus, and continued to be colloquially referred to as &quot;Dulwich College&quot;. The &quot;Lower school&quot; for boys between 8 and 16, had lower fees and a syllabus and was aimed at children of the industrial and poorer classes. The Lower School was the incorporation of the boys from the grammar school established in the previous decade and was referred to as &quot;Alleyn&#x27;s College of God&#x27;s Gift&quot;, although this was the name of the complete charitable foundation.

===1870: The New College===
Dulwich College was included in Howard Staunton&#x27;s 1865 book, &quot;The Great Schools of England&quot;, who wrote of the &quot;unusually comprehensive [scheme of instruction]&quot; and by the mid-1860s such was the enhanced reputation of the school that the pressure for places led to the introduction of a competitive examination. In 1869 the upper school took possession of the current site, referred to as the &quot;New College&quot;, but it was not until Founder&#x27;s Day (21 June) 1870 that the new college was officially opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales. The new college buildings, sited in the of Dulwich Common, were designed by Charles Barry Jr. (the eldest son of Sir Charles Barry). The lower school alone continued to occupy the Old College in Dulwich Village from 1870 until it was moved to its new (and current) premises in East Dulwich in 1887.

The present school colours and school magazine (&quot;The Alleynian&quot;) were established in the 1860s and 1870s, as were school societies such as &quot;Debating&quot; and &quot;Natural Science&quot;. By the time Canon Carver retired from the position of Master in 1882, Dulwich College was said to have expanded more rapidly in the previous 25 years than any other establishment and to be &quot;holding its own at universities&quot;, to have &quot;won a large number of places of honour in the Indian and Home Civil Service&quot; and &quot;at the Royal Military College of Woolwich&quot; and to be well represented among &quot;the public schools medals of the Royal Geographical Society and the prizes of the Art Schools of the Royal Academy&quot;.

=== 1882: Separation from Alleyn&#x27;s School; the college&#x27;s &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; ===
Despite its excellent reputation, the college was the focus of pressure by the Charity Commissioners and other parties (including the Board of Governors and the outlying parishes named in Edward Alleyn&#x27;s will) to reorganise it and divert much of its endowment to other schemes. The Master, Canon Carver, resisted these pressures for many years, finally winning an appeal in 1876 at the highest possible level (the Privy Council) where Lord Selborne ruled in his favour. In 1882, the Charity Commissioners finally issued a scheme that Canon Carver found acceptable. This passed into law by Act of Parliament and resulted in the Upper and Lower schools being officially split into separate institutions.

The Upper School became Dulwich College (&quot;officially&quot; for the first time) and the Lower became Alleyn&#x27;s School. Both schools remained within the College of God&#x27;s Gift charitable foundation (along with James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, St Olave&#x27;s and St Saviour&#x27;s Grammar School, and the three Central Foundation schools in Finsbury and Bishopsgate).

Two Boards of Governors came into being. Both Dulwich College and Alleyn&#x27;s School were to be managed by the college Governors, who also administered the Chapel and Picture Gallery. The Estates and Almshouses were placed in the hands of the Estates Governors. The foundation and the college are still governed under the same arrangement. The Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s position as Visitor was also changed to that of Honorary Visitor of Alleyn&#x27;s College of God&#x27;s Gift, his powers being vested in the Charity Commissioners. Dulwich College&#x27;s income is derived from the contributions by the Estates Governors, among whom the College Governors are well represented (having eight of the twenty five places) Canon Carver retired at this point, being the first headmaster to be both appointed and retired by Act of Parliament.

Canon Carver was said to have given the college a body, but Arthur Herman Gilkes (Master from 1885 to 1914) to have given it a soul, with his noble ideals of scholarship and public service. He founded the College Mission in a poverty-stricken part of Camberwell.

London County Council scholars were admitted to Dulwich College from 1903. The college was saved from bankruptcy by the &quot;Dulwich College Experiment&quot; or &quot;Gilkes Experiment&quot;, the work of A. H. Gilkes&#x27;s son Christopher Gilkes (Master from 1941 to 1953), the forerunner of the state &quot;Assisted Places Scheme&quot;, by which the majority of boys selected to attend the college had their fees paid by local councils. This resulted in an academic &quot;renaissance&quot; of the college, which came to a climax from the late 1950s when the college was at the forefront of the schools winning awards on entry to Oxford and Cambridge.

==School arms==

When Edward Alleyn founded the school he was awarded a coat of arms and crest. This was used by the school until, in 1935, it was decreed by the College of Arms that it was the exclusive property of Edward Alleyn and his family. The new arms granted by the College of Arms were very similar to the old ones, retaining most of the features. Deism and learning are represented by the flames in the crest. From the ring of flames an arm with a hand holding a heart protrudes. This probably symbolises charity and has a twofold meaning. First, it represents Alleyn&#x27;s charitable intentions, and second it recalls Alleyn&#x27;s famous speech, written by Ben Jonson, when he presented King James I with the flaming heart of London during &quot;The Magnificent Entertainment&quot;, involving a procession through the streets and through triumphal arches by which the City of London welcomed King James I from Scotland in 1604. The lower portion of the shield incorporates the original shield being an argent (silver) background on which are placed a chevron (bent bar) dividing three cinquefoils gules (red five-leafed flowers).

==Houses==
===Boarding Houses===
Boarders now belong to one of three boarding houses, although the number of boarding houses has fluctuated over time. Those up to age 16 (Year 11) live in The Orchard, while boys of the Upper School (Year 12 and Year 13) live in either Ivyholme or Blew House.

A notable addition to Dulwich College’s boarding options is the introduction of flexi-boarding, catering to the evolving needs of students and their families. This flexible approach allows students to blend their boarding experience with the demands of their academic pursuits and extracurricular activities, offering a balance that aligns with individual preferences.

After the college was reconstituted in 1857, most of the boys were day-boys, but provision was made for boarders, and the Governors licensed three boarding houses to be kept by respectable ladies in the village (hence they were then known as &quot;dames&#x27; houses&quot;). A fourth was added soon afterwards. The number of functioning boarding houses has fluctuated between one and five since that point and in total there have been six different houses:

; Blew House: Now one of the two senior houses, it was moved to its current position on College Road in the 1930s on the site of what had previously been the Master&#x27;s garden (who had been residing in the south block of the New College). The original Blew House is called Old Blew House and still stands in Dulwich. Blew House was the only house to remain in commission throughout the Second World War for Alleynians and became a senior house at this point.

; Ivyholme: The second of the two current senior houses, it too was moved to its current position on College Road in the 1930s. It was bombed during the Second World War but was re-opened soon after as a senior house. During the Second World War whilst housing students of the School of Oriental and African Studies (who were going through a crash course in languages sponsored by the War Office) it was also run by the Master of the College.

; The Orchard: This is the only junior house still functioning as a boarding house. It was bombed during the Second World War but was re-opened as one of two junior houses very close to the war ending. During the Second World War, like Ivyholme, it housed students of the School of Oriental and African Studies who were going through a crash course in languages sponsored by the War Office.

; Elm Lawn: This was the house in which P.G.Wodehouse once boarded prior to it becoming a junior house. After the Second World War it re-opened as a junior house, along with &quot;The Orchard&quot;. In 1949 the boys of Elm Lawn were moved into Bell House (see below) and it became the home of the Master of the College, and still is today.

; Bell House: This 18th-century building close to Dulwich Picture Gallery became the family home of the Master of the College in 1927 who until then had lived with his family in the south block of the New College. The Master moved out of this premises during the Second World War into Ivyholme. When Ivyholme reopened as a boarding house it was decided that the Master should not return to Bell House because it was too large for the purposes of a family residence. The Master moved to The Chestnuts and then in 1949 to Elm Lawn. Meanwhile, Bell House was adapted as a boarding house and became the second junior house, replacing Elm Lawn. In 1993 it was returned to private ownership, as the college recognised the lack of need for a second junior boarding house.

; Carver House: As the number of boys requiring boarding increased towards the end of the Second World War a fifth house was created by converting the cricket pavilion. It was named after Canon Carver, first Master of the reconstituted College, but it did not last long in this form.

====Boarding house clubs and colours====

The colour system (for more detail see &quot;School uniform and colours&quot; below) also extended to the boarding houses due to their particular impact on college life. At one time, Bell, Ivyholme and Blew had their own sports teams and their own distinct colours. Those awarded colours could wear ties and caps and for outstanding contribution the house blazer was awarded. Boarders with no colours could wear black ties to distinguish them from day boys.

Today, senior boys can still become members of the Zodiac and Caerulean Clubs for Ivyholme and Blew respectively. The house captain, who is automatically a member of the club, controls membership of clubs, and such membership confers the right to wear a special tie. When, across the school, the uniform was standardised in 1970, the tradition of the house blazers disappeared save for the House Captain who, if he has earned full school colours, may wear the house blazer.

====Gordon Bowl====
This trophy was presented to the college prior to the Second World War. It was a trophy competed for by boarders only presented by an Old Alleynian, A. G. Gordon. It was originally competed for by the four boarding houses (when there was no junior/senior distinction), but after the Second World War only by the senior houses Blew House and Ivyholme until 2017, the year which Orchard were re-added to the competition. It is still played for today.

===Day Houses===
All boys are members of one of eight day houses or &quot;Athletic Houses&quot; as they were originally known. The Houses were the brainchild of W.D. (&#x27;Scottie&#x27;) Gibbon, an assistant master and rugby coach. The idea was decided upon in 1919 and in the school magazine, &quot;The Alleynian&quot;, of March 1920 the process was described. The division would be into six houses to be named after &quot;distinguished Englishmen of the Elizabethan period&quot; (see table below). The name of Shakespeare was omitted as being considered pre-eminent. Upon their original creation Boarders and Day Boys were divided thus: &quot;Grenville&quot; included &quot;Blew House&quot;, &quot;Marlowe&quot; included &quot;The Orchard&quot;, &quot;Spenser&quot; included &quot;Elm Lawn&quot;, &quot;Sidney&quot; included &quot;Ivyholme&quot; and two entirely Day-boy houses were created: &quot;Drake&quot; and &quot;Raleigh&quot;. In 1982 two more Houses (Jonson and Howard) were added due to an increased College roll. 
The athletic houses were created to improve the standard of games at the college, which had deteriorated during the First World War. Before the creation of these houses, the most keenly anticipated matches were the Boarders vs Day-Boys or the Prefects vs The Rest of the School. The Athletic Houses produced, and still produce, Big Sides and Little Sides for competition. Big Sides are Houses teams that include players who also represent the school and Little are House sides that do not include school sporting representatives.
A boy&#x27;s house is decided randomly or through family connection where possible. The houses continue to compete in sporting and cultural competitions (such as music, drama, chess and debating). The Cock House &quot;Shield&quot; or &quot;Cup&quot; are presented to the leading House at the end of the school year taking into account all competitions.

== School uniform and colours ==
The dress code for pupils of Dulwich College depends on the boarding or day houses a boy might belong to, the sports teams represented, or whether a boy has attained school colours or become a prefect. Alleyn had prescribed the clothing of poor scholars to be &quot;a white calico surplice, a long coat such as that worn by Christ&#x27;s Hospital boys, of good cloth of sad (dark and sober) colour, a bodice lined with canvas, skirts with cotton lining, canvas shirts, white cotton drawers, knitted stockings, shoes and belt, a girdle and a black cap.&quot; This is how boys were dressed for more than two centuries, until the new foundation in 1857.

In 1863, the Master, Alfred Carver, decreed the uniform should be &quot;Short tunic buttoned to the chin, trousers of an Oxford mixture, an ordinary rifle cap with a broad band and narrow peak, and a dark coloured Inverness cape for winter.&quot; Under Carver, boys still wore waistcoats of varied hues and &quot;the latest creations in neckties&quot;. This was suppressed in 1883 by the new Master, Welldon, whose first rule on arrival was that the boys should wear uniform, a forerunner of the subfusc jackets of today.
The colours of the college, blue and black, according to tradition are based on Marlborough College although Haileybury is more likely the model. It is known that in 1864 caps were introduced, with cross ribbons of purple soon altered to blue. The college arms were added in 1875. From this time, the colour scheme arose for rewarding achievement, limited at first to sport with blazers for the 1st and 2nd team of the major sports, rugby and cricket (as well as ties, caps and squares). The minor sports also had colours, although these did not extend to a full blazer. Rather, athletics, fives, shooting, boxing, tennis, swimming, gymnastics, fencing and waterpolo had blazer badges (plus caps and ties). Additionally, the boarding houses, which historically had a disproportionate effect on the sporting life of the college, had their own boarding house colours. &quot;(For more details see Boarding Houses)&quot;
By 1909 there were seventeen different caps plus a variety of blazers. The striped jackets for prominent sportsmen also conferred certain privileges, such as having the right to proceed first through the doors of centre block.

Further emphasising status were special caps for major sports colours. Rugby had a pie-shaped porker with tassels. Likewise, prefects wearing caps quartered in blue and black, could unbutton their jackets and keep their hands in their trousers. The most exclusive items took precedence even over the striped blazers of members of the 1st teams for major sports. The very best rugby players were on rare occasions awarded the rugby honours cap, and perhaps the most fabled item of all, still displayed in the college&#x27;s Wodehouse library, was the white blazer. This was only awarded on the recommendation of the Field Sports Committee (see Sport section) with the essential requirement being that a boy be a member of both the Cricket 1st XI and the Rugby 1st XV &quot;and&quot; display prominence in a minor sport (e.g. boxing, fives, squash, fencing, shooting).
This uniform changed little until the 1960s (save for the arms change in 1935, and the addition of the house colours on sports shirts following the athletics houses foundation in 1920). By the 1960s, boys (other than prefects and those with sporting honours) had to wear a black jacket and either grey flannels or pinstripe trousers in the Autumn and Winter terms. Shortly after the start of the Summer term, an announcement would be made that henceforth, for the rest of the term, blazers (navy blue with a white embroidered DC in gothic script) and grey flannels would be worn, along with the option of boaters. The traditional cap which was balanced on the back of the head was to be worn when in uniform off school premises and (no doubt because of its precarious perch) boys would &quot;cap&quot; those to whom they would otherwise have raised their caps. &quot;Capping&quot; involved touching the college arms on the cap with the left hand. The 1960s saw the demise of caps and boaters and a reduction in the variety of blazers, as well as the end of shirts with separate collars.

== Co-curricular ==

=== Sport ===
When Arthur Herman Gilkes became Master, he adhered to Carver&#x27;s belief that the physical organisation of the school should be based on the principle that as far as possible management should be in the hands of the boys. Therefore, he continued the tradition of the general running of games being entrusted to a Field Sports Board (sometimes referred to as the Field Sports Committee), composed of the &quot;school captain, captains of cricket, football (rugby), gymnastics, the baths (swimming), fencing, fives, athletics sports, boxing and shooting&quot;. Gilkes had it that the only masters with authorised status with regards to games were the captain of the Rifle Corps, and treasurer of the Sports Board. By 1894 there no more masters on the Field Sports Committee. The Board at the time controlled the appointment of captains and had some say in the style of blazers that could be worn as uniform. It was the Field Sports Committee, for example, that governed the award of the college&#x27;s most prestigious colours, the white blazer. The system today is very different with assistant masters now being in charge of games, and acting more as coaches.

Colours for sporting achievement were the first such colours to be established at the college (see School uniform and colours below). Originally colours consisted of blazers for the 1st and 2nd team of the major sports, rugby and cricket (as well as ties, caps and squares) and colours for minor sports, (not extending to a full blazer but blazer badges plus caps and ties). Caps were also available, such as for rugby, the pie shaped porker and more exclusive items such as the rare rugby honours cap, and the white blazer, only awarded on the recommendation of the Field Sports Committee with the essential requirement being that a boy be a member of both the Cricket 1st XI and the Rugby 1st XV &quot;and&quot; display prominence in a minor sport. Testament to the judgment of the committee are the careers of certain alumni who received this blazer such as Trevor Bailey the England cricket all-rounder, who was so awarded because he was also a distinguished squash player.

The college still divides sport into Major and Minor. The major sports have always included rugby and cricket in the Michaelmas and summer terms respectively and for many decades just these two were deemed as major. In the 20th century, field hockey became a major sport in the Lent term, having been introduced in 1953. Soccer, a minor sport since it was allowed in 1970, became of equal status to hockey in 2000. A raft of minor sports has also been recognised at the college for well over a century in many cases. Minor sports have included athletics from 1864; Fives from 1894 (effectively ended by the courts being destroyed by enemy bombs in the Second World War); shooting from 1878 (less applicable due to safety regulations and the loss of the .22 range); boxing from 1879 (abandoned in the 1960s but with martial arts now filling the void), tennis from 1880 (although banned during A H Gilkes&#x27; time); swimming from 1883 with the college being one of the first schools to erect a swimming pool; gymnastics from 1891; fencing (like boxing, saw a demise in the 1960s but still has a representative team); squash and water polo. The school also has teams for golf; badminton; basketball; croquet; cycling; skiing; table tennis and Rugby fives. The facilities, which include a sports centre complex, courts for most racquet sports, an athletic track, tennis courts, a swimming-pool and acres of playing fields, cater to almost all sporting requirements. The Cow corner position in Cricket is said to be named after a field at the College where cricket was played, a position that cows would congregate as there was little reason to place a fielder there.

===Rowing===
The school has an active rowing club called the Dulwich College Boat Club (a recent introduction in 1991 – the school now owns a boathouse on the River Thames). The club is affiliated to British Rowing (boat code DUL) and has produced four British champion crews at the 2001 British Rowing Championships, 2008 British Rowing Championships, 2014 National Schools&#x27; Regatta, and 2016 Schools&#x27; Head of the River Race

===Rugby===

The major sport of the Michaelmas term, Dulwich College rugby has long enjoyed a powerful reputation. The school began its rugby tradition with a 1–0 victory over City of London School in 1859, 12 years before the founding of the Rugby Football Union. Since that time the school has had upwards of 30 Old Alleynians play at full international level, with more playing at schoolboy international level, national reserve and professional club rugby as well as representatives for invitational sides such as the Barbarians.

Three British and Irish Lions have emerged from the college. 1909 featured an unbeaten first XV which contained five future internationals dubbed the &quot;Famous Five&quot;. Between 2012 and 2014, Dulwich College won the Natwest Schools Cup (previously known as the Daily Mail Cup) three times in a row, then in 2017 secured an historic double, becoming the first ever team to win both the schools cup (in the years mentioned) and the Champions Trophy, the highest Tier of School Cup Rugby.

=== Combined Cadet Force ===
Dulwich College has a well-established Combined Cadet Force contingent that has been running since the organisation was founded in 1859. The cadets can choose between three sections: Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force, with most cadets joining in year 9. Since 2018 the contingent has accepted female cadets from James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School. The contingent regularly conducts battlecraft trips, Air Experience Flights at RAF Benson and expeditions to the arctic or desert. The contingent are Gold medal winners in the Cadet Cambrian Patrol and have won the Guthrie Cup, London district shooting competition, and the cadet and young adult segments of the CCF and Inter-Services National First Aid Competitions. The contingent has won the Air Squadron Trophy Competition five times since its inception, first in 1998 in the inaugural year of the modern format of the competition, and most recently in 2020.

=== Scouts ===
Dulwich College has a scout troop which has two patrols within it. It runs from year 6 to year 13 with both scouts and explorers. The troop is called the 25th Camberwell and has been running for more than 80 years.

=== Dulwich College Union ===
Dulwich College has a large union for clubs and societies containing over 50 societies. There is a wide range of clubs ranging from Rocketry to History and the college used to have a Chicken society in which boys tended to the college&#x27;s chickens. The clubs, and Union, are run by boys in Year 12 and 13 and contribute to their The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Awards. Most of these clubs and societies have their own personalised ties.

==== Debating ====
Within the Dulwich College Union debating plays a large role. The Dulwich College society runs during the school terms but competes both nationally and internationally. The society runs from year 7 to 13 and has around 50 members. It has recently enjoyed great success, winning the Oxford Union Debating Competition in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Cambridge Union Schools Debating Competition in 2014, 2015, and 2018, and the ESU (English Speaking Union) Schools Mace Debating Competition, also in 2014 and 2015. It has also represented Team England and competed internationally against other national teams, including in Texas, Singapore and Stuttgart. Dulwich College is, therefore, ranked as one of the top debating schools in the UK and one of the best in the world.

==School magazine==
The Dulwich College school magazine is called the &quot;Alleynian&quot;, named after the school&#x27;s founder Edward Alleyn. This magazine was first published in 1873, although the school&#x27;s first magazine under the name the &quot;Dulwich College Magazine for School News and General Reading&quot; had been published in 1864 but only lasted for fourteen issues after its editor left for Cambridge University. &quot;The Alleynian&quot; was edited at one point by P. G. Wodehouse in his last year at the school.

==Old Alleynians==
Old boys of Dulwich College are called &quot;Old Alleynians&quot;, after the founder of the school. This is often abbreviated to &quot;O.A.&quot; as post-nominal letters in brackets in school publications or publications specifically concerning the school. The term should not be confused with &quot;Alleyn&#x27;s Old Boys&quot; used for alumni of Alleyn&#x27;s School. Current pupils of the school are known as Alleynians. Prior to around 1880, the terms &quot;Alleynian&quot; and &quot;Old Alleynian&quot; were not used and the pupils and ex-pupils were known as &quot;Dulwichians.&quot;

Notable Old Alleynians include Sir Ernest Shackleton, Sir P G Wodehouse, Raymond Chandler, Sir Edward George, Bob Monkhouse, Michael Ondaatje, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Nicholas Galitzine, politician and broadcaster Nigel Farage, the cricketer Trevor Bailey, C. S. Forester, the architect C. F. A. Voysey, and the comedian Paul Sinha.

==Headmastership of Dulwich College==
The head master of Dulwich College is styled &quot;The Master of Dulwich College&quot;, as laid out in the 1882 scheme of the charity commissioners. This continued a tradition of the head of the College of God&#x27;s Gift being called the &quot;master&quot; since its foundation in 1619. The foundation originally had a governing body consisting of a master, warden, four fellows, and six assistants made up of the two churchwardens of each of the three parishes of St Botolph&#x27;s, Bishopsgate, of St Saviour&#x27;s, Southwark, and of St Giles&#x27;, Cripplegate. The master was most senior, followed by the warden and on vacancy of the mastership, the warden succeeded. By the 1857 Dulwich College Act the master, warden and fellows were pensioned and the governance of the foundation switched to a body of nineteen governors. However, the position of &quot;master&quot; continued as the title of the headmaster of the new upper school, with an undermaster as deputy. The 1882 act (as a result of the charity commissioners scheme) abolished the office of undermaster.

**Joseph A. F. Spence (appointed 2009)
In June 2024, the College announced the forthcoming retirement of Joseph Spence, and his replacement by Robert Milne, effective September 2025. However, Spence retired in September 2024 in the wake of an incident at a staff party. Fiona Angel was appointed as Acting Master for the subsequent year, having served in that position for two previous terms.

==Collections==
The school has a very extensive archive, especially of material relating to drama and the arts, much of which is from Edward Alleyn&#x27;s (the founder) own library. Apart from diaries kept by Alleyn and his partner Philip Henslowe are many other documents relating to the college and foundation. There are also 12 volumes of unpublished music by John Reading; two of the three volumes of the First Folio Shakespeare; a Mercator Atlas; first editions of poetry by John Donne, Edmund Spenser and Dryden; A Book of Hours from the fifteenth century and even a copy of the first book to be printed in London in 1480.

Other interesting artefacts held by the college include the &quot;James Caird&quot;, the lifeboat in which Ernest Shackleton made his intrepid voyage for survival to South Georgia from Elephant Island in 1916, as well as other items such as sledges from the earlier &quot;Nimrod&quot; expedition.

Above the fireplace in the Masters&#x27; Library are two panels depicting &quot;pietas&quot; (Duty) and &quot;liberalitas&quot; (Generosity) bought by Edward Alleyn in 1618 from Elizabeth I&#x27;s state barge. They are reputed to have originally come from Francis Drake&#x27;s &quot;Golden Hinde&quot;.

== Controversies ==

=== Sexual Abuse Allegations ===
In March 2021, a former pupil published an open letter to the Master, Joseph Spence, in which it was claimed that the school was a &quot;breeding ground for sexual predators&quot; and had an &quot;established rape culture&quot;. The letter referenced hundreds of anonymous allegations of harassment or assault against former and current pupils both at the college and at neighbouring schools, as well as a failure of school administration to respond to allegations, and claimed that some Dulwich College pupils had a reputation for such behaviour, particularly among female students at nearby schools.

Spence said he &quot;condemned unreservedly the alleged social and sexual misconduct&quot; which he said was &quot;distressing and entirely unacceptable&quot;.

==In culture and cultural influence==
===Artwork===

In 1870, the buildings of the New College were painted by the impressionist artist, Camille Pissarro. Pissarro was at the time living in Upper Norwood, having fled from France at the time of the Franco-Prussian War, and was entranced by the London landscapes.

===Film &amp; TV===
The College grounds have been used as a filming location for various Hollywood and Bollywood films &amp; TV programmes. Some include Legally Blonde starring Reese Witherspoon, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider starring Angelina Jolie and ‘83 starring Ranveer Singh.

<text>Facel S.A. was a French manufacturer of pressed steel automobile components and, subsequently, complete automobiles of their own design.

To intensify its World War II war effort, French subcontracting company for military aeronautics Bronzavia created a subsidiary called Facel (acronym of &quot;Forges et Ateliers de Constructions d&#x27;Eure-et-Loir&quot;) in December 1939. After the war, in 1945, by merging with Métallon, Facel began to make short-run special bodies, coupés or cabriolets for Simca, Ford of France, Panhard and Delahaye. Approximately 2,900 cars of all models were hand-built in Facel&#x27;s short life.

Unitary bodies without a chassis became general for mass-produced cars, and Facel lost its big customers. French niche manufacturers ceased production. Métallon left the partnership in 1953, and Facel set about designing and making its own complete cars using engines made by Chrysler, Volvo and Austin. Its first design, named Vega, was shown to the public in 1954.

The Facellia model, introduced in 1959, was under-developed, and losses brought about by its warranty problems became impossible to recoup. Prior to closure, Facel had been placed under the control of Sud Aviation subsidiary SFERMA (&quot;Société Française d&#x27;Entretien et de Réparation de Matériel Aéronautique&quot;). Though initially successful, Facel closed its factory in October 1964.

==Business history==
Facel was founded on 20 December 1939 by Bronzavia, a French manufacturer of military aircraft, to make special components. Marcel Koehler (formerly of motorcycle manufacturer Koehler-Escoffier) directed Facel from 1939 to 1945. He gave way to Jean Daninos when he returned from the United States, summoned by Henri Feuillée, the ex-boss of Bronzavia and a large shareholder of Facel. Jean Daninos had begun his career with Citroen, where he assisted in the design of the Traction coupés and cabriolets. He moved to Morane-Saulnier, then in 1937 to Bronzavia as technical director. During WWII he worked in the US with General Aircraft, which was using Bronzavia patents, but he returned in 1945 and took charge of Facel. Daninos merged Facel with Metallon, a tie maintained until January 1953.
;Coachwork provider
Daninos had Facel begin manufacturing short-run and special complete finished bodies for the major French brands. In conjunction with l&#x27;Aluminium Français Facel designed the all-aluminium alloy Panhard Dyna X and then built around 45,000 examples for Panhard. The body work assembly division was established in 1948. It made various models of Simca Sport and drew publicity by designing with Pininfarina and then building a special body on a Bentley Mark VI chassis. The car was named the Bentley Cresta. The exercise was repeated in 1951 and named Cresta II. September 1951 saw the introduction of its Ford Comète. Production of the Comète ended in 1955 when Simca took over Ford France. The styling of the Crestas and Comètes was developed into the shape of the first Vega.
;Scooter bodies, truck bodies, tractor bodies, jeeps and smaller components
During the same period, Facel-Metallon pressed out body panels for Delahaye&#x27;s army jeeps (painted and upholstered); Simca, Delahaye and Somua&#x27;s trucks (painted and upholstered); scooters by Vespa, Piaggio and Motobécane; tractors by Massey Ferguson; and stainless-steel bumpers, hubcaps and grilles for Simca/Ford and for Renault.
;Aviation
In conjunction with Hispano-Suiza, Facel-Metallon and Facel also turned out combustion chambers in special metals for Rolls-Royce jet engines.
==Facel Vega==

The Facel Vega marque was created on 22 July 1954 by Jean Daninos, (brother of the humorist Pierre Daninos, who wrote &quot;Les Carnets du Major Thompson&quot;), although the Facel company had been established by the Bronzavia Company in 1939 as a subcontracting company for the aviation industry. FACEL (Forges et Ateliers de Construction d&#x27;Eure-et-Loir, &quot;in English: forge and construction workshop of the department of Eure-et-Loir&quot;) was initially a metal-stamping company but it expanded into car manufacturing in the early 1950s.

Facel entered the automobile business as a supplier of special bodies for Panhard, Delahaye and Simca. The company was headquartered in Paris at 19 Avenue George V, and had the main assembly factory in Colombes at 132 Boulevard de Valmy, with parts supplied from the outskirts of the city in Amboise, Dreux and Puteaux.

===Facel Vega FV, HK500 and Facel Vega II===


The Vega production cars (FV, later and more famously the HK500) first appeared in October 1954 at the Salon de l&#x27;Automobile Paris using Chrysler V8 engines because no French company at the time produced an engine that met the company&#x27;s objectives. Initially, a DeSoto Hemi engine was installed, while the overall engineering was straightforward, with a tubular chassis, double wishbone suspension at the front and a live axle at the back, as in standard American practice. They were also as heavy as American cars, at about . Performance was brisk, with a top speed of around and 0 to in just under 10 seconds.

Most cars were two-door hardtops with no centre pillar, but a few convertibles were built for special customers (including Daninos&#x27; wife: eleven of the FV series and a single HK500 were drop tops, out of 842 built in total) in spite of Daninos&#x27; dislike of the bodystyle due to its lack of structural rigidity. Fully 77 percent of the production was exported, due to the punitive Tax horsepower system in France.

The 1956 model was improved with a bigger Chrysler Hemi engine and updated transmission and other mechanicals. In the same year, production began of a four-door model, the &quot;Excellence&quot;, with rear-hinged doors (suicide doors) at the back and no centre pillar. The pillarless design unfortunately made it less rigid and the handling was thus poorer than that of the two-door cars, and surviving examples are rare.

1959 models had even bigger engines, a and later a Chrysler Typhoon engine, and were quite a bit faster despite their extra weight. The final evolution of the V8 models came in 1962 with the Facel Vega II, which was lighter, with sleeker, more modern lines, substantially faster, and famously elegant.

===Facellia===
In 1960, Facel entered the sports car market with the Facellia, with a premiere at the Paris Motor Show in 1959. It was a small car similar in size to the then popular Mercedes 190SL. Facellias were advertised in three body styles: cabriolet, 2+2 coupé and 4-seat coupé — all with the same mechanical parts and a wheelbase. Styling was similar to the Facel HK500, but with rather elegant (though fingernail-breaking) flush door handles. Following Facel Vega&#x27;s demise several of M Daninos&#x27;s styling cues were &quot;borrowed&quot; by Mercedes-Benz. Prices were roughly US$4,000 for the Facellia ($ in dollars ), US$5,500 for the Facel III ($ in dollars ) and US$6,000 for the Facel 6 ($ in dollars ).

With the idea of creating a mass-produced all-French sports car competing with the Alfa Romeo Giulietta, the Triumph TR3 and Porsche 356B, Facel moved away from Chrysler engines because Chrysler didn&#x27;t offer a four-cylinder engine at the time. Instead, the Facellia had a four-cylinder 1.6 L twin-cam engine designed by former Talbot-Lago chief engineer Carlo Machetti, who won at Le Mans, along with the advice of famed English cylinder-head guru Harry Weslake, and built in France by Paul Cavallier of the Pont-à-Mousson company (which already provided manual gear boxes for the company&#x27;s larger models) so as to be compliant with the punitive French horsepower tax system and increase sales. The engine had only two bearings supporting each camshaft, using special steels, as opposed to the usual four or five. Despite the metallurgical experience of Pont-à-Mousson, this resulted in excessive flex, timing problems, and frequent engine failures.

Famed engineers Charles Deutsch and Jean Bertin were called in to solve the issues, but it was not enough and the engine was pronounced a disaster and the Facellia with it. The updated Facellia F2 was presented at the March 1961 Geneva Motor Show. Company president, Jean Daninos having been obliged to resign in August 1961 in response to the company&#x27;s financial problems, the new boss, a former oil company executive called André Belin, gave strict instructions to the after-sales department to respond to customer complaints about broken Facellia engines by replacing the units free of charge without creating &quot;difficulties&quot;. The strategy was intended to restore confidence among the company&#x27;s customer base. It would certainly have created a large hole in the income statement under the &quot;warranty costs&quot; heading, but it may have been too late for customer confidence.

;Volvo engine

The troublesome powerplant was replaced with a Volvo B18 engine in the Facel III, but the damage was done. Production was stopped in 1963 and despite the vision of it being a &quot;volume&quot; car, only 1,100 were produced - still enough to make this Facel&#x27;s highest production number. Facel lost money on every car they built, with the luxury car side of the company being supported entirely by the other work done by Facel Metallon.

The small Facellia met with little success and the losses from this, due to strong competition at the luxury end of the market, killed off the business which closed its doors at the end of October 1964. What was, according to some, the best small Facel, the Facel 6, which used an Austin-Healey 2.8-litre engine, came too late to save the company with fewer than 30 having been produced when the financial guarantors withdrew their support.

===Prominence===
Prominent owners of Facel Vegas (mainly of Facel IIs) included Pablo Picasso, Ava Gardner, Christian Dior, Herb Alpert, Joan Collins, Ringo Starr, Max Factor Jr, Joan Fontaine, Stirling Moss, Tony Curtis, several Saudi princes, Dean Martin, Fred Astaire, Danny Kaye, Louis Malle, The President of Mexico, François Truffaut, Robert Wagner, Anthony Quinn, Hassan II, King of Morocco, Debbie Reynolds, the Shah of Iran, Frank Sinatra, Maurice Trintignant, Brian Rix, Joe Hepworth and French Embassies around the world. Race-car driver Stirling Moss would drive his HK500 from event to event rather than fly.

French writer and Nobel Prize winner Albert Camus died in a Facel Vega FV2 driven by his publisher&#x27;s nephew, Michel Gallimard. At the time of his death, Camus had planned to travel by train, with his wife and children, but at the last minute accepted Gallimard&#x27;s proposal to travel with him instead.

<doc id="162647" wikidata="Q4353208" url="?curid=162647" title="Today (BBC Radio 4)">
<text>Today, colloquially known as the Today programme, is BBC Radio 4&#x27;s long-running morning news and current-affairs radio programme. Broadcast on Monday to Saturday from 06:00 to 09:00 (starting on Saturday at 07:00), it is produced by BBC News and is the highest-rated programme on Radio 4 and one of the BBC&#x27;s most popular programmes across its radio networks. In-depth political interviews and reports are interspersed with regular news bulletins, as well as &quot;Thought for the Day&quot;. It has been voted the most influential news programme in Britain in setting the political agenda, with an average weekly listening audience around 6 million.

==History==
&quot;Today&quot; was launched on the BBC Home Service on 28 October 1957 as a programme of &quot;topical talks&quot; to give listeners an alternative to listening to light music. The programme&#x27;s founders were Isa Benzie and Janet Quigley. Benzie gave the programme its name and served as its first &quot;de facto&quot; editor. It was initially broadcast as two 20-minute editions slotted in around the existing news bulletins and religious and musical items. It became part of the BBC&#x27;s Current Affairs department in 1963, and started to become more news-orientated. The two editions also became longer, and by the end of the 1960s it had become a single programme two hours in length that enveloped the news bulletins and the religious talk that had become &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; in 1970. In May 1977, Radio 4 controller Ian McIntyre cut it to two 25-minute parts, filling the gap with &quot;Up to the Hour&quot;. The new format was unpopular with BBC staff, including Peter Donaldson who on at least one occasion openly ridiculed the programme on air. It also provoked comments in the diary columns of the daily newspapers. From July 1978, &quot;Today&quot; returned to its previous length and &quot;Up to the Hour&quot; was dropped.

Jack de Manio became its principal presenter in 1958. He was held in affection by listeners, but became notorious for on-air gaffes (announcing a documentary on Nigeria titled &quot;The Land of Niger&quot; as &quot;The Land of Nigger&quot;, and referring to Yoko Ono as &quot;Yoko Hama, or whatever her name is&quot;, for instance). In 1970 the programme format was changed so that there were two presenters each day. De Manio left in 1971, and in the mid-1970s the team of John Timpson and Brian Redhead became established. Timpson had been critical of the content, style and professionalism of &quot;Today&quot;; describing it once as &quot;not so much a programme, more a way of telling the time&quot; and being filled with &quot;eccentric octogenarians, prize pumpkins, and folk who ate lightbulbs and spiders&quot;.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, under editors Ken Goudie and Julian Holland, &quot;Today&quot; made moves to broaden its appeal away from broadcasting a lot of national politics with London-centric bias. Presentation was split for a time between London, usually by John Timpson, and from Manchester, usually by Brian Redhead. The objective was to make it more of a balanced, national programme. The on-air humour of the two presenters and the split of locations made the programme very popular and influential. Brian Redhead was quoted, &quot;If you want to drop a word in the ear of the nation, then this is the programme in which to do it.&quot; This pairing lasted until Timpson&#x27;s retirement in 1986. Other presenters during this period included Libby Purves in the late 1970s. John Humphrys and Sue MacGregor joined the rotating list of presenters in 1986. Peter Hobday, who had first broadcast on the programme in the 1950s, was a regular presenter from the early 1980s and a favourite with listeners because of his relaxed, urbane style.

By this time the programme was benefiting from publicity gained after it became known that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was a regular listener. Ministers thus became keen to go on the programme, but the tough, confrontational interviewing they encountered led to accusations that the BBC was biased. Criticism was particularly directed against Redhead, who was often seen as being on the left. Chancellor Nigel Lawson accused him, during a live interview in 1988, of having been a Labour voter all his life. The style of the male interviewers was analysed and contrasted with the approach of MacGregor, who was alleged to be giving subjects an easier time. The &quot;Big 8:10&quot; interview that follows the 8 am news had become an important institution of British politics, a position it retains.

After Brian Redhead died in January 1994, James Naughtie became a member of the team. Peter Hobday presented the programme regularly until 1996; Sarah Montague replaced MacGregor in 2002. Carolyn Quinn was a regular presenter until 2008 as was Edward Stourton until 2009. Other more occasional presenters include the BBC&#x27;s Stephen Sackur and Tim Franks. Evan Davis and Justin Webb were the newest regular presenters to join the roster until Mishal Husain in 2013. Husain became the second regular female presenter when Naughtie began to cover the Scottish Independence referendum as a &quot;Good Morning Scotland&quot; presenter for two days a week, and across the BBC&#x27;s output. Naughtie returned to &quot;Today&quot; before the 2015 general election.

On 7 July 2015, the BBC announced that James Naughtie was to leave the programme, to become a Special Correspondent for BBC Radio 4. Two days later, Nick Robinson was announced as Naughtie&#x27;s replacement. In April 2018, Martha Kearney joined the team in a straight swap with Sarah Montague, who left to take over Kearney&#x27;s old role as lead presenter of &quot;The World at One&quot;.

On 19 September 2019, John Humphrys hosted his last edition of &quot;Today&quot;, after 32 years on the show. His last major guests were former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair, as well as drag personality Dame Edna Everage.

On 17 December 2024, Mishal Husain hosted her final shift as Today co-presenter, with several past and present Today presenters joining her in the studio to pay tribute.

==Guest editors==

Beginning in 2003, for over one week at the end of December, guest editors have been invited to commission items for one edition of the programme. These usually reflect their social or cultural interests and at the end of each edition the guest editor is interviewed by a member of the regular presenting team about the experience. Guest editors participating in the inaugural year of this feature were Monica Ali, Thom Yorke, Stephen Hawking, and Norman Tebbit, who is a frequent critic of the programme. Since its inception, notable guest editors have included: David Blunkett, who used the programme as an opportunity to &quot;turn the tables&quot; on John Humphrys in 2005; Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose appearance on 29 December 2006 encompassed discussions of his growing concerns about the &quot;justification&quot; for the invasion of Iraq, Britain&#x27;s role in the affair, and the consequences for British armed forces; and Peter Hennessy, who, on 28 December 2007, led a visit to HMS &quot;Vigilant&quot; (a British Trident submarine) alongside its base at Faslane. Others including Queen Noor of Jordan (2005), Bono (2004) and Sarah, Duchess of York (2004) have also pitched in for this one-day editorial stint to promote their causes and interests.

==Notable features==
The programme has a regular slot for sports news and items, &quot;Sports Desk&quot;, between 26 and 30 minutes past each hour, regularly presented by Garry Richardson (from 1981 to 2024), Jonathan Legard or Rob Bonnet and occasionally by Alison Mitchell, Karthi Gnanasegaram or Chris Dennis. From 1977 to 2024 it carried a daily horse racing tip.

If Parliament is in session the previous day there will be a summary at about 06:50 (Yesterday in Parliament) presented by two from Robert Orchard, David Wilby, Rachel Hooper and Susan Hulme.

Journalist and historian Peter Hennessy has made an assertion in one of his books that a test that the commander of a British nuclear-missile submarine must use to determine whether the UK has been the target of a nuclear attack (in which case he has sealed orders which may authorise him to fire his nuclear missiles in retaliation), is to listen for the presence of &quot;Today&quot; on Radio 4&#x27;s frequencies. If a certain number of days (said to be three) pass without the programme being broadcast, that is to be taken as evidence that the orders must be executed. The true conditions are of course secret, and Hennessy has never revealed his sources for this story, leading Paul Donovan, author of a book about &quot;Today&quot;, to express some scepticism about it. However, the longwave signal of Radio 4 is capable of penetrating to surface depths where submarines can rise, although it does not have the range required to be heard at this depth far from the UK&#x27;s coastal waters.

==Message boards==
In 2001, the &quot;Today&quot; programme created a system of message boards allowing the users of its web site to challenge thinking on current affairs with all those contributing. Available statistics indicate the amassing, over five years, of up to 18,000 separate discussions – topic threads – sometimes with as many as 3,000 contributions per thread. However, on 16 November 2006 the programme changed its board policy so that only the producers of &quot;Today&quot; could start a thread, but all contributors could still join in with them. This action appeared to have been unpopular with past contributors and, it seems, many stopped dealing with &quot;Today&quot; in favour of other outlets. After the changes there were fewer contributions, but, on occasion, contributions made by the public were featured on-air in the &quot;Today&quot; programme. Message boards dedicated to the &quot;Today&quot; programme were discontinued around mid-2008 and listeners were invited to use the general BBC &#x27;Have Your Say&#x27; board.

==Podcast==
A podcast, &quot;Beyond Today&quot;, was launched on 29 October 2018. Presented alternately by Tina Daheley and Matthew Price and aimed at a younger audience, the production team contains the same number of women from black and ethnic minority backgrounds as it does men.

Another podcast, &quot;The Today Podcast&quot;, was launched on 5 October 2023 and is presented by Amol Rajan and Nick Robinson. They discuss the news stories as featured on &quot;The Today Programme&quot;.

==Controversy==
&quot;Today&quot; found itself in the midst of controversy again in 2002, when its editor Rod Liddle wrote a column in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that was extremely critical of the Countryside Alliance and which raised questions about his own impartiality. In the article, he wrote that catching &quot;a glimpse of the forces supporting the Countryside Alliance: the public schools that laid on coaches; the fusty, belch-filled dining rooms of the London clubs that opened their doors, for the first time, to the protesters; the Prince of Wales and, of course, Camilla ... and suddenly, rather gloriously, it might be that you remember [why you voted Labour] once again.&quot; He resigned from his post on &quot;Today&quot;.

In the summer of 2003, &quot;Today&quot; once again found itself at the centre of allegations of political bias, this time against a Labour government. The controversy arose after &quot;Today&quot; broadcast a report by its correspondent Andrew Gilligan. The report alleged that a dossier the British Government had produced to convince the British public of the need to invade Iraq had been &quot;sexed up&quot; (deliberately exaggerated), and that the government had known this prior to publishing it. In his live interview with presenter John Humphrys, just after 6.07 a.m., Gilligan asserted that the dossier and the Government &quot;probably knew&quot; that one of the main claims in the dossier &quot;was wrong&quot;. Gilligan&#x27;s anonymous source for the claim was Dr David Kelly, a key adviser on biological weapons who had worked in Iraq – though it was never established whether Dr Kelly had actually used the words Gilligan attributed to him. In the furore that followed Gilligan&#x27;s report, Kelly&#x27;s name became public and he was forced to appear before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. Shortly afterward he was found dead following presumed suicide. In the ensuing public inquiry (the Hutton Inquiry), which reported in January 2004, the BBC was heavily criticised. This led to the resignation of the BBC&#x27;s chairman, Gavyn Davies, the Director-General, Greg Dyke, and Andrew Gilligan.

On Friday 5 November 2010, the programme was not broadcast due to 48-hour strike action at the BBC. Transmission continued the next day, in spite of ongoing industrial action, as Evan Davis and Sarah Montague decided to break the strike.

==Criticism==
&quot;Radio 4 on the whole is good for using serious female presenters, but the &quot;Today&quot; programme lets it down badly&quot;, commented former &quot;Today&quot; newsreader Alice Arnold early in 2013, pointing out that Sarah Montague was (then) the only female presenter among the regular presenters. During 2010, editor Ceri Thomas acknowledged that the gender balance was not ideal, but faced criticism for saying in an interview that the programme was not going to be the &quot;first place you&#x27;ll see those changes because it&#x27;s just too tough an environment for novices, frankly&quot;. Radio 4 presenter Mariella Frostrup described the men involved in running the programme in an interview as &quot;a bunch of misogynists&quot;, but later retracted this statement by saying she had been &quot;careless&quot; in her vocabulary.

In 2011, &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Kira Cochrane and colleagues researched the female–male ratio in the British media for a month. Concerning &quot;Today&quot; they found 83.5% of the contributors were male and the remaining 16.5% female. The issue was thought important enough for culture minister Ed Vaizey to request a meeting with the BBC in January 2012, and for Director-General George Entwistle, at the start of his brief period in charge of the BBC, to advocate that the next new &quot;Today&quot; presenter should be female.

An interview with David Cameron conducted by John Humphrys in 2006 received 200 complaints concerning Humphrys&#x27; aggressive approach and &quot;excessive&quot; interruptions. Ceri Thomas became the programme&#x27;s editor shortly afterwards and was asked about this issue. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to rule out the confrontational interview as it is on occasion necessary... [A]ll the evidence we&#x27;ve got shows that the audience is overwhelmingly behind John Humphrys in general and support our right to do [this] kind of interviews.&quot;

In a 2012 article decrying the BBC&#x27;s attitude to science reporting, &quot;Guardian&quot; science columnist Martin Robbins wrote: &quot;The &quot;Today&quot; programme claims to be serious, but seems to work on the basis that the best way to enlighten viewers is to take two people and force them into a sort of intellectual-masturbation death match. Graham Linehan appeared on the show last year to discuss his adaptation of &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; and found himself ambushed by questions that weren&#x27;t just hostile, but sometimes completely bizarre.&quot; Expert Women&#x27;s Days, intended by the BBC as a training exercise intended in part to increase the number of female interviewees on &quot;Today&quot;, took place in several locations in 2013.

<text>Tildonk is a village located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant and, since 1977, is part of the municipality of Haacht, together with Wespelaar, Wakkerzeel and Kelfs. It has a total area of 7.31 km².

==History==
Traces of civilization have been found from the period of around 3000 BCE between the hamlet Hambos and adjacent Kelfs. Later there was a Gallic settlement at about the same location. The oldest mention of Tildonk occurred in 1107 in the family name of Reinerus de &quot;Thieldunck&quot;.

The name &quot;Tildonk&quot; is the joining of 2 medieval words: &quot;til&quot; (forest) and &quot;donk&quot; (elevation). During the 12th century the knights van Tildonk, pledged to the Duke of Brabant, lived in two mottes: Oudenborg and Nieuwenborg (where the current Kasteeltje is located). Tildonk was elevated to the title of county in 1699 as part of the fiefdom of Charles L&#x27;Archier. Later it came into the hands of the noble house of Lalaing. Count Maximilian de Lalaing was the most prominent de Lalaing lord of Tildonk.

Since 1750, Tildonk is traversed by the Leuven-Rupel canal and, since 1837, by the Mechelen-Leuven railroad line.

In 1821, the priest Joannes Cornelius Martinus Lambertz started the Ursulines convent that later became the &quot;mother convent&quot; of numerous new institutions spread over 4 continents. The convent was renowned for its international school. The stylish Art Nouveau hall for parties was used as a setting in various films.

==Protected cultural heritage==
* The village centre (convent, church, cemetery, rectory)
* The lock and lock house
* The farm of de Lalaing (Kasteeltje)
* The Our Lady of Comfort Chapel (Onze-Lieve-Vrouw van Troostkapel)

==Coat of arms==
In 1967, the municipality of Tildonk took over the escutcheon of the noble family de Lalaing: &quot;an oval escutcheon of gules with 10 united diamonds of silver, placed 3, 3, 3 and 1, the escutcheon held by two golden griffins looking backwards, topped with a crown of 3 fleurons separated by 3 groups of 3 pearls&quot;.

<text>Dirk Uipko Stikker (5 February 1897 – 23 December 1979) was a Dutch politician and diplomat of the defunct Liberal State Party (LSP), co-founder of the defunct Freedom Party (PvdV) and of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), and businessman. Stikker was known for his abilities as a manager and negotiator. Stikker continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death. He holds the distinction as the first Secretary General of NATO from the Netherlands.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Winschoten, he studied law at the University of Groningen. After his studies he began a career in the banking sector. In 1935, he became the director of Heineken International, the famous beer company. He held this post until 1948. In 1945, he was among the organizers of the Stichting van de Arbeid (Dutch Labour Foundation), thus helping to lay the foundation for post-war collective bargaining in the Netherlands.

==Career==
From 1922 until 1926, Stikker worked as an accountant for the Twentsche Bank, and then as Director of a branch of the bank from 1926 until 1928. Then in 1928 until 1935 Stikker worked as a regional manager for the Twentsche Bank. Stikker worked as member of the management board for Heineken N.V. from 1 July 1935 until 1 August 1948 and as chairman of that board from 1940 until 1948. Following the end of World War II, Queen Wilhelmina ordered a Recall of Parliament and Stikker became a Member of the Senate taking the place of the deceased Samuel van den Bergh, on 20 November 1945. On 23 March 1946, the Liberal State Party was renamed as the Freedom Party. Stikker was one of the co-founders and became the Leader of the Freedom Party and Chairman. On 24 January 1948, the Freedom Party (PvdV) and the &quot;Committee-Oud&quot; merged to form the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). Stikker was one of the co-founders and became the first Chairman of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy.

After election of 1948 the Leader of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and Parliamentary leader of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy in the House of Representatives Pieter Oud opted to remain in the House of Representatives instead of accepting a ministerial post in the new Cabinet Drees–Van Schaik and endorsed Stikker who had been serving as the Deputy Leader as Minister of Foreign Affairs, taking office on 7 August 1948. The Cabinet Drees–Van Schaik fell on 24 January 1951 and was replaced by the Cabinet Drees I with Stikker continuing as Minister of Foreign Affairs, taking office on 15 March 1951. In February 1952 Stikker announced that he would not stand for the election of 1952. The Cabinet Drees I was succeeded by the Cabinet Drees II on 2 September 1952. Stikker remained in active politics, he was appointed as the Ambassador of the Netherlands to the United Kingdom, serving from 10 September 1952 until 15 June 1958 when he was appointed as the Permanent Representative of the Netherlands to NATO and the OECD. In April 1961 Stikker was nominated as the next Secretary General of NATO. He resigned as Permanent Representative on 21 April 1961 the day he was installed as Secretary General, serving from 21 April 1961 until 1 August 1964.

After election of 1948 the Leader of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and Parliamentary leader of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy in the House of Representatives Pieter Oud opted to remain in the House of Representatives instead of accepting a ministerial post in the new Cabinet Drees–Van Schaik and endorsed Stikker who had been serving as the Deputy Leader as Minister of Foreign Affairs, taking office on 7 August 1948. The Cabinet Drees–Van Schaik fell on 24 January 1951 and was replaced by the Cabinet Drees I with Stikker continuing as Minister of Foreign Affairs, taking office on 15 March 1951. In February 1952 Stikker announced that he would not stand for the election of 1952. The Cabinet Drees I was succeeded by the Cabinet Drees II on 2 September 1952. Stikker remained in active politics, he was appointed as the Ambassador of the Netherlands to the United Kingdom, serving from 10 September 1952 until 15 June 1958 when he was appointed as the Permanent Representative of the Netherlands to NATO and the OECD. In April 1961 Stikker was nominated as the next Secretary General of NATO. He resigned as Permanent Representative on 21 April 1961 the day he was installed as Secretary General, serving from 21 April 1961 until 1 August 1964.

After his retirement, Stikker occupied numerous seats as a corporate director and nonprofit director for supervisory boards in the business and industry world and for supervisory boards for several international non-governmental organizations and research institutes (Unilever, Van Lanschot, Netherlands Atlantic Association, Carnegie Foundation, Trilateral Commission and the DSM Company) and as an advocate and lobbyist for European integration and serving on several commissions for the European Economic Community and state commissions on behalf of the Dutch government. He served as the Secretary General of NATO from 21 April 1961 until 1 August 1964.

==Politics==
Stikker entered politics in 1945, when he was elected to the Senate of the States General. On 23 March 1946, he co-founded the Partij van de Vrijheid (PvdV, Freedom Party), together with some former members of the pre-war Liberale Staatspartij (LSP, Liberal State Party). On 24 January 1948, the PvdV was absorbed by the Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie (VVD, Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy), which is the country&#x27;s most important Liberal party. Stikker was the VVD&#x27;s first chairman.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs===
In 1948, Stikker became minister of foreign affairs in the first government led by Willem Drees, holding that position until 1951. After his party adopted a no-confidence motion over the government&#x27;s colonial policy in New Guinea, Stikker resigned on 23 January 1951, prompting the cabinet&#x27;s fall. He returned to that position less than two months later. The Netherlands played an important role in the creation of NATO and the European Coal and Steel Community during Stikker&#x27;s time in office as minister of foreign affairs.

===Ambassador===
After his ministerial office, Stikker was ambassador to the United Kingdom (1952–1958) and head of the Dutch Permanent Representation to the North Atlantic Council and to the Organization for European Economic Co-operation, the predecessor of the OECD (1958–1961).

===Secretary General of NATO===
On 21 April 1961 he succeeded Paul-Henri Spaak to become the third Secretary General of NATO. He resigned due to poor health on 1 August 1964.

==Personal==
In 1964, Stikker was awarded an honorary doctorate by Brown University. He died in Wassenaar in 1979, aged 82.

<text>Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton (; 29 May 1716 – 1 January 1800) was a French naturalist and contributor to the &quot;Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers&quot;.

==Biography==

Daubenton was born at Montbard, Côte-d&#x27;Or. His father, Jean Daubenton, a notary, intended him for the church, and sent him to Paris to study theology, but Louis-Jean-Marie was more interested in medicine. Jean&#x27;s death in 1736 set his son free to choose his own career, and in 1741 he graduated in medicine at Reims and returned to his hometown, planning to practice as a physician. At about this time, Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon, also a native of Montbard, was preparing to bring out a multi-volume work on natural history, the &quot;Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière&quot;, and in 1742 he invited Daubenton to assist him by providing anatomical descriptions. In many respects, the two men were complete opposites, but they worked well in partnership. In 1744, Daubenton became a member of the French Academy of Sciences as an adjunct botanist, and Buffon appointed him keeper and demonstrator of the king&#x27;s cabinet in the Jardin du Roi.

In the first section of the &quot;Histoire naturelle&quot;, Daubenton gave descriptions and details of the dissection of 182 species of quadrupeds, thus securing himself a high reputation as a comparative anatomist. Concerned about the readability and profitability of the &quot;Histoire naturelle&quot;, Buffon dropped Daubenton&#x27;s anatomical descriptions from later editions as well as from the series on birds, but Daubenton continued to work closely with Buffon at the Jardin du Roi.

Daubenton published many articles in the memoirs of the Parisian Académie Royale des Sciences, presenting his research on animals, the comparative anatomy of extant and fossil animals, vegetable physiology, mineralogy, agriculture, and the merino sheep that he successfully introduced into France. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1775. From 1775 onwards, Daubenton lectured on natural history in the College of Medicine, and in 1783 on rural economy at the Alfort school. He was also professor of mineralogy at the Jardin du Roi. As a lecturer he was in high repute, and to the last retained his popularity. In December 1799 he was appointed a member of the senate, but at the first meeting which he attended he fell from his seat in an apoplectic fit and, after a short illness, died at Paris.

Daubenton&#x27;s name is commemorated in several species names, most notably the lemur the aye-aye (&quot;Daubentonia madagascariensis&quot;), Daubenton&#x27;s bat (&quot;Myotis daubentoni&quot;) and a kale known as .

==Relatives==
He is not to be confused with his cousin Edmé-Louis Daubenton, who was also a naturalist.

<text>The Asian Social Forum was a left-wing conference held by members of the alter-globalization movement (also known as the Global Justice Movement). It aims to allow social movements, trade unions, NGOs, refugees, peace and anti-imperialist groups, anti-racist movements, environmental movements, networks of the excluded and community campaigns mainly from the Asian region to come together and discuss themes linked to major Asian and global political issues. It emerged from the World Social Forum.

The conference was held between 2–7 January 2003 in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. It was held at 90 or more venues. And was attended by 8,000 delegates.

From 2006, the World Social Forum is &quot;polycentric,&quot; occurring in various parts of the world, continuing the same concept but without the title &quot;Asian Social Forum.&quot; The Karachi Social Forum was held between 24 and 29 March 2006.

<doc id="162654" wikidata="Q310779" url="?curid=162654" title="René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur">
<text>René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur (; ; 28 February 1683 – 17 October 1757) was a French entomologist and writer who contributed to many different fields, especially the study of insects. He introduced the Réaumur temperature scale.

==Life==
Réaumur was born in a prominent La Rochelle family and educated in Paris. He learned philosophy in the Jesuits&#x27; college at Poitiers, and in 1699 went to Bourges to study civil law and mathematics under the charge of an uncle, canon of La Sainte-Chapelle. In 1703 he went to Paris, where he continued the study of mathematics and physics. In 1708, at the age of 24, he was nominated by Pierre Varignon (who taught him mathematics) and elected a member of the Académie des Sciences. From this time onwards for nearly half a century hardly a year passed in which the did not contain at least one paper by Réaumur.

At first, his attention was occupied by mathematical studies, especially in geometry. In 1710, he was named the chief editor of the &quot;Descriptions of the Arts and Trades&quot;, a major government project which resulted in the establishment of manufactures new to France and the revival of neglected industries. For discoveries regarding iron and steel he was awarded a pension of 12,000 livres. Content with his ample private income, he requested that the money should go to the Académie des Sciences for the furtherance of experiments on improved industrial processes. In 1731 he became interested in meteorology, and invented the thermometer scale which bears his name: the Réaumur. In 1735, for family reasons, he accepted the post of commander and intendant of the royal and military Order of Saint Louis. He discharged his duties with scrupulous attention, but refused the pay. He took great delight in the systematic study of natural history. His friends often called him &quot;the Pliny of the 18th century&quot;.

He loved retirement and lived at his country residences, including his chateau La Bermondière, Saint-Julien-du-Terroux, Maine, where he had a serious fall from a horse, which led to his death. He bequeathed his manuscripts, which filled 138 portfolios, and his natural history collections to the Académie des Sciences.
Réaumur&#x27;s scientific papers deal with many branches of science. His first, in 1708, was on a general problem in geometry. His last, in 1756, on the forms of birds&#x27; nests. He proved experimentally the fact that the strength of a rope is more than the sum of the strengths of its separate strands. He examined and reported on the auriferous (gold-bearing) rivers, the turquoise mines, the forests and the fossil beds of France. He devised the method of tinning iron that is still employed, and investigated the differences between iron and steel, correctly showing that the amount of carbon is greatest in cast iron, less in steel, and least in wrought iron. His book on this subject (1722) was translated into English and German.

He was noted for a thermometer he constructed on the principle of taking the freezing point of water as 0°, and graduating the tube into degrees each of which was one-thousandth of the volume contained by the bulb and tube up to the zero mark. It was an accident dependent on the particular alcohol employed which made the boiling-point of water 108°; mercurial thermometers graduated into 80 equal parts between the freezing- and boiling-points of water are named Réaumur thermometers but diverge from his design and intention.

Réaumur wrote much on natural history. Early in life he described the locomotor system of the Echinodermata, and showed that the supposed ability of replacing their lost limbs was actually true. He has been considered as a founder of ethology.

In 1710 he wrote a paper on the possibility of spiders being used to produce silk, which was so celebrated at the time that the Kangxi Emperor of China had it translated into Chinese. His observations of wasps making paper from wood fibres have led some to credit him with this change in paper-making techniques. It was over a century before wood pulp was used on any industrial scale in paper making.

He studied the relationship between the growth of insects and temperature. He also computed the rate of growth of insect populations and noted that there must be natural checks since the theoretical population numbers achievable by geometric progression were not matched by observations of actual populations.

He also studied botanical and agricultural matters, and devised processes for preserving birds and eggs. He elaborated a system of artificial incubation, and made important observations on the digestion of carnivorous and graminivorous (grass-eating) birds. One of his greatest works is the , 6 vols., with 267 plates (Amsterdam, 1734–1742). It describes the appearance, habits and locality of all the known insects except the beetles, and is a marvel of patient and accurate observation. Among other important facts stated in this work are the experiments which enabled Réaumur to prove the correctness of Peyssonel&#x27;s hypothesis, that corals are animals and not plants.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1738 by virtue of the fact that:His Name hath been known for many years among the Learned by Several Curious disertations published in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris &amp; in particular by a very Learned and usefull book wrote in French entitled &#x27;The Art of Converting Forged Iron into Steel&#x27; and &#x27;the Art of Soft&#x27;ning Cast Iron&#x27; printed at Paris 1722 4to and lately by his &#x27;Curious Memoires relating to the History of Insects&#x27; at Paris in 4to three Volumes of which work have been Laid before the Royal Society.He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1748.

He is commemorated in numerous place names including the rue Réaumur and the Réaumur - Sébastopol metro station in Paris and the Place Réaumur, Le Havre.

<doc id="162655" wikidata="Q742909" url="?curid=162655" title="Chappe et Gessalin">
<text>Chappe et Gessalin is the short-form of the name of French coachbuilder &quot;Carrosserie Chappe Frères et Gessalin&quot;. The company built automobile bodies and did contract assembly for other automobile manufacturers. It was also the parent of Automobiles CG, a French automobile maker founded in 1966 which built and sold complete cars under its own name.

==Early history==

===The 1930s and 1940s===
The story of Chappe et Gessalin began in 1932, in the commune of Saint-Maur-des-Fosses near Paris. In that year the Carrosserie Chappe was founded by Jean Chappe. Working with him were his three sons, Abel, Albert and Louis and an apprentice, Amédée Gessalin. The shop did bodywork in both wood and steel.

The Second World War interrupted the company&#x27;s activities for a time but they resumed at the end of hostilities. In 1946 Jean sold the carrosserie to his three sons. By that time Amédée was also a part of the family, having married the Chappe&#x27;s eldest daughter Marie-Louise. The brothers added his name to the masthead and the company became &quot;Carrosserie Chappe Frères et Gessalin&quot;. On the death of Amédée his son Jean took his father&#x27;s place in the company.

The new company&#x27;s work included commercial vehicles, a specialty being the construction of firetruck bodies on truck frames produced by Delahaye. They also carved out a niche doing more specialized work, such as bodywork in duralumin for Talbot and repairs on the Delahaye 135, 136 and Talbot T26 racing cars owned by Charles Pozzi, who would become a major dealer in Ferrari and Maserati cars.

===The 1950s and 1960s===
Before his death Amédée Gessalin taught his son how to draw and plan vehicles. Jean, an admirer of great Parisian designers Chapron and Figoni, worked on honing his own skills by attending evening classes taught by these men.

Chappe et Gessalin provided the aluminum bodywork for the Bosvin-Michel Speciale (BMS) throughout its many revisions. This car was designed and built by Camille Bosvin and driven by Guy Michel. It had a tubular-steel frame and was noteworthy in being one of the first cars to mount its engine (from a Renault 4CV) amidships. The BMS was a regular at Montlhéry, and won the Bol d&#x27;Or in 1952 and 1953.

Another project that Chappe et Gessalin were involved with was the SCVS-DB specials. These cars, given chassis numbers 1065 and 1066 by Renault, were initially a project of Renault dealers Jean Rédélé and Louis Pons. The cars were built by the small French firm of Deutsch-Bonnet with aluminum bodywork by Chappe et Gessalin. Power came from a Renault 4CV engine. One of the cars appeared at Le Mans in 1953.

In the early 1950s Chappe et Gessalin began experimenting with Fibre-reinforced plastic, (specifically Fiberglass). Using resins and techniques imported from the United States they started producing lightweight automobile bodies for sportscars and racing cars from a succession of independent fabricators and small manufacturers.

Deutsch-Bonnet themselves became a client of Chappe et Gessalin, who started by providing plastic noses for DB&#x27;s monomil single-seaters and bodywork for other racers and would go on to build 200 copies of DB&#x27;s &quot;Le Mans&quot; road car.

Even when the founders of Deutsch-Bonnet, René Bonnet and Charles Deutsch, ended their partnership in 1961 and established separate car companies (Automobiles René Bonnet and CD), they both continued to use lightweight fibreglass bodywork supplied by Chappe et Gessalin. René Bonnet went to them to develop bodywork for his new Djet. For Charles Deutsch Chappe et Gessalin produced the body of the Panhard-powered racing CDs and built 160 of the Panhard CD road cars.

The company also worked with less well-known companies such as Camille Martin&#x27;s UMAP (1957-1959) and Raymond Gaillard&#x27;s Arista.

Apart from the SCVS-DB cars, throughout the 1950s Jean Rédélé was involved in several automotive projects, including several Rédélé Spéciales, the Marquis, PlastiCar, and others. Rédélé crossed paths with Chappe et Gessalin often and would in time become their most famous client of all.

As a young man Jean Gessalin drew a small coupé based on Renault 4CV mechanicals as a design exercise for himself, which design he left behind while away performing his compulsory military service. On his return he discovered that his drawing has been turned into a car by his family.

A Renault concessionaire named Charles Escoffier saw the car and contacted his son-in-law, Jean Rédélé. 25 copies of the car were ordered from Chappe et Gessalin to be sold by Rédélé as the &quot;Alpine&quot;. Renault backed the new company, and numbered the car &quot;106&quot;. With the release of the A106 in 1955 the Alpine company was officially born.

In 1960, just as production of the A106 ended, Chappe et Gessalin moved their operations to the commune of Brie-Comte-Robert, still near Paris.

Chappe et Gessalin continued to build the A106 coupé and the subsequent A106 cabriolet, even though the cabriolet was styled by Michelotti. After 251 copies were built, the A106 was succeeded by the A108 and again, Chappe et Gessalin built the coupé, as well as a new 2+2. This time, though, Alpine opted to build the cabriolet version themselves. Rédélé had set up a new company named RDL to bring bodywork in-house with Alpine. Eventually the A108 was in turn replaced by the A110, but this time Chappe et Gessalin would only be doing bodywork, upholstery and paintwork for the A110 GT4 2+2. Final assembly was done at the Alpine works in Dieppe, although the car carried CG badges on its flanks.

==Automobiles CG==
In the early 1960s, the staff at Chappe et Gessalin had grown to around 40 people.

While it continued working with a variety of car builders, demand from one of its largest customers, Alpine, was diminishing as Alpine&#x27;s associated bodyworks, RDL, took over production of most Alpine models.

In 1964 management at Chappe et Gessalin began planning to become an automobile manufacturer in their own right. The new venture would be known as Automobiles CG (&quot;CG&quot; for Chappe et Gessalin). While there were already the skills in-house to do the styling and mechanical design of an entire car as well as produce the bodywork and chassis, they would need to source engines, transmissions, suspension parts, brakes and associated trim.

With Renault committed to Alpine and with Peugeot and Citroën (with Panhard) declining to participate, Automobiles CG turned to the Simca company and their pool of production mechanical components to supply its needs. Parts for the first CG came from a wrecked 1000 provided by Simca dealer Roger Civet.

The design of the first CG model began in 1965, and the car debuted at the 1966 Salon de l&#x27;Auto in Paris. Called the 1000 Spider, it was a small rear-engined convertible with a 2+2 fiberglass body that used powertrain and suspension components from the Simca 1000.

Since Jean Gessalin had designed what would become the very first Alpine, it was no surprise that the first CG bore a strong resemblance to its cousin from Dieppe, right down to the exposed hinges on the car.

The car received positive reviews for its appearance and the high level of fit and finish, but drivers were unimpressed by the produced by the engine and the high price.

CG later offered a high-performance version of the same engine that had been tuned by Michel Tapie from Rodez with power boosted by 50 percent to .

Different variations of the original 1000 were produced over its three-year lifespan.

The 1000 Spider was replaced by the CG 1200S in 1968. The engine was now the same as that found in the Simca 1200S, and power was double that of the original 1000. It is during the time that the 1200S was being built that CG began to collaborate with Chrysler Europe (via the Simca division in France) in sportscar racing and rallying.

In 1972 the third and final major CG model entered production, the CG 1300. Power was now provided by the same engine found in the Simca 1000 Rallye 2. This model also received many upgrades to its body and trim.

==The sign of the Gallic Cockerel==
Even though the first CG cars debuted in 1966, it was not until 1970 that an official emblem was designed for them. The image was based on the &quot;Coq Gaulois&quot; (the Gallic Cockerel). While &quot;Coq Gaulois&quot; and &quot;Chappe et Gessalin&quot; shared a common monogram, the image was also related to the company&#x27;s address in Brie-Comte-Robert, which was on the &quot;Rue du Coq Gaulois&quot;.

The designer of the emblem was Albert Uderzo, who is primarily known as the artist responsible for the &quot;Astérix&quot; comic series.

==CG Cars==

=== CG 1000 (1966 - 1969, type A1000) ===
The CG 1000 Spyder was unveiled at the 1966 Salon de l&#x27;Auto in Paris. The compact convertible had a fiberglass body mounted on a steel chassis with a deep &quot;U&quot; centre backbone and tube-and-sheetmetal outriggers. The chassis was designed by CG. Power came from a 944 cc inline 4-cylinder Simca Poissy engine. This motor had a cross-flow aluminum cylinder head and a cast-iron block with 5 main bearings. It was mounted in the rear of the car, canted over at 15 degrees from vertical and drove the wheels through a 4-speed transaxle that used Porsche-style synchronizers. The radiator was mounted at the rear beside the engine. Steering was worm-and-roller by Gemmer. Front suspension was by a lower transverse leaf spring and upper A-arms while at the rear were swing-axles with semi-trailing arms and coil springs. Brakes were disks on all four wheels, courtesy of the Simca 1000 Bertone coupé. The car, weighing 640 kg, was attractive and displayed a very high quality of finish. Less well received was the vague steering and the meagre power from the stock engine. The price of the Spider was 16,990 francs.

One year after the release of the 1000 Spider a new, lower-price model debuted; the 1000 Sport. The price for this model was down to 14,990 francs. While the engine was the same 944 cc unit, it had been modified by engine tuner Michel Tapie from Rodez and power had been boosted by 50 percent to . To bring the price down from that of the 1000 Spider, the roll-up glass windows were replaced by plastic sliders, the bumpers and hubcaps were removed, the dashboard was painted rather than covered and the seats were simple fibreglass tubs, changes which also brought the weight down to 600 kg. The 1000 Sport came with a removable hardtop.

In 1968 the 1000 Spider and 1000 Sport disappeared from the lineup, and two new cars were introduced, one of which was the CG 1000S. Trim on the 1000S was similar to the original 1000 Spider, but the engine displaced and produced . The &#x27;S&#x27; was available as either a full coupé (non-removable) or convertible.

Dimensions:
 long, wide, high, wheelbase. Front track was , rear track was .

=== CG 1200 S (1968 - 1972, type B1200) and 548 ===
The other new model released in 1968 was the CG 1200S. This model was offered as a coupé or a convertible, although only 33 soft-tops were built by the factory. By upgrading to the engine from the Simca 1200 S coupé, CG was finally able to offer a sports car with performance comparable to the Alpine A110. With the engine power output was , twice that of the original 1000 Spider.

Brakes were disks all around but were now activated by a servo-assisted dual-circuit system. Rack-and-pinion steering replaced the old Gemmer system and anti-roll bars were added front and rear. There was also a new rear axle with dual movable joints as found on the B-series Simcas, allowing for negative camber setup. The rear end now also had two shock-absorbers per side. The radiator was moved to the front of the car, which now had an opening to admit cooling air. Weight was 660 kg

Dimensions:
 long, wide, high, wheelbase. Front track was , rear track was .

A special model intended for racing was developed out of the 1200S. This CG, called the 548, was a lightweight special, the name of the car also being its weight in kilograms.

To achieve this light weight many changes were made to the car. The lateral chassis beams were recessed into the main chassis and some lower-chassis details were restructured. The steel floor was replaced with aluminum and the engine and transaxle were mounted rigidly to two ties on the chassis, allowing the rear chassis structure to be removed completely, replaced only by a lateral rod tying the two sides of the chassis together. The bodywork was thinner than normal, all glass was replaced with acrylic or plexiglass deflectors, the bumperettes were removed and the gas filler neck was relocated. The air intake at the front was larger than on the 1200S, and a large mesh opening in the rear allowed engine heat to escape. The rear deck now ended in a full-width spoiler.

The 548 was available with an optional Constantin supercharger that brought power output up to .

=== CG 1300 (1972 - 1974, type C1300) ===
In 1972, the last regular GC road car, the CG 1300, was released. Once again, displacement had grown and the car now had the engine from the Simca Rallye 2. Power was initially and torque was up to 80 ft-lbs. The car, only available as a coupé, had a new lower front valance with a spoiler and an even larger air intake for the radiator. Front indicator lamps were from a later model Simca 1000 and were mounted under the headlamps. From the doors back the rear quarter-panels had been reshaped and the rear quarter windows had also been changed. The tail of the car had been shortened by . Taillights were rectangular units from the Simca 1100 and new cast bumperettes were used.

The 1300 would only be in production for one and one-half years, from 1972 to 1974.

Dimensions are:
 long, wide, high, wheelbase. Front track was , rear track was .

===Model comparison===
==The end of the road==
The GC 1300 would be the last car produced at Chappe et Gessalin. In 1964 Matra had acquired the assets of the René-Bonnet company, and by 1970 Matra themselves were 50% owned by Chrysler. When Simca selected Matra&#x27;s Bagheera as the successor to the Bertone-designed Simca 1200S this eclipsed any hopes CG may have had to raise their own profile within Simca.

In 1973 the oil crisis struck. In France, Prime Minister Pierre Messmer announced national speed-limits and, most devastatingly, a one-year ban on motor-racing.

The last CG 1300s were delivered in the spring of 1974, after which the small company of Brie-Comte-Robert closed its doors permanently.

Following the closure of the CG plant, Jean-Michel Ribot-Bruno&#x27;s Coulimmiers-based Geriplast company took over the after-sales service and repair of the CG bodywork. The CG construction equipment and molds were transferred to GERIPLAST at the end of 1974. Geriplast would use these to itself become a manufacturer of GERIPLAST barquettes (modified CG spiders) and then GERI barquettes and single-seaters, developed jointly with Michel Bonenfant.
In 2016 there was a 50th anniversary retrospective of CG held at the Cite de l&#x27;Automobile.

==CG in competition==
While CGs had been raced prior to its release, the lightweight 548 was the first CG built expressly for motor racing.

In April 1969 Henri Chemin came to Chrysler, rejoining his former boss from Ford France, William Reiber. Chemin was appointed head of the competition department and given three objectives:
# Start winning races, including rallies, as soon as possible
# Rebuild the image of Simca&#x27;s brand with young drivers
# Add to Matra&#x27;s already impressive list of victories

Chemin campaigned a 1200XS coupé with the new 1812 cc OHC Simca Type 180 engine in a series of rallyes, but the car could not overcome the Alpines. Towards the end of the year CG agreed to collaborate with the Simca division of Chrysler Europe in a new venture to be called Simca-CG. Simca-CG would go racing with a jointly-developed car to be called the Simca-CG Proto MC.

Although some histories say that the Proto MC&#x27;s chassis was designed by Matra, there is little concrete evidence for the company&#x27;s direct involvement. An indirect connection to Matra was established when, through the influence of Simca, Matra engineer Bernard Boyer was assigned to the development team. Boyer was also a former employee of Chappe et Gessalin and son-in-law of Albert Chappe.

The Simca-CG Proto MC was a mid-engined (MC standing for &quot;Moteur Centrale&quot;) two-seater car with a monocoque-and-tubular hybrid chassis. The engine was the Chrysler/Simca Type 180 that had been used in the 1200XS coupés. Early cars made do with the 1812 cc engine but later cars would have 2156 cc, 2207 cc and 2310 cc versions of the Type 180 motor. The transaxle came from a Porsche 914.

Bodywork for the first cars was derived from the existing molds for the CG 1200S and 548 models. Later spiders would have as much as cut from their length, and one car was built with a truncated cabin that gave it the appearance of a small truck.

The project was launched in February 1970, design work was completed by the end of May and the car was built and track testing was starting by the end of July.

Its first race was on August 8, 1970 at Mont-Dore, and the car&#x27;s first Championship win was at the 1970 Critérium des Cévennes, with Gérard Larrousse driving.

For the 1972 season Simca brought in engine specialists JRD, who increased the displacement and made other modifications to increase the power output and deal with reliability issues arising from the greater stresses.

Over the course of three seasons the MC posted victories in 32 out of 49 races entered.

Drivers were Bernard Fiorentino, Gérard Larrousse, Michel Saliba and Philippe Renaudât.

In April 1973, Simca Chrysler dissolved the competition department, leaving only Matra Sports to continue in Sports-Prototypes racing.

Many (non-MC) CGs continued to be active in historic racing. Several of these cars were described as &quot;CG 1600s&quot;, but these appear to have been custom engine swaps rather than factory originals.

In 2012, with the approval of Jean Gessalin and support from Bernard Chappe, Didier Malga launched &quot;CG Sport&quot;, an attempt to revive the brand as a competition group.

<text>Skat (), historically Scat, is a three-player trick-taking card game of the ace–ten family, devised around 1810 in Altenburg in the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. It is the national game of Germany and, along with Doppelkopf, it is the most popular card game in Germany and Silesia and one of the most popular in the rest of Poland. A variant of 19th-century Skat was once popular in the US. John McLeod considers it one of the best and most interesting card games for three players, and Kelbet described it as &quot;the king of German card games.&quot; The German Skat Association assess that it is played by around 25 million Germans – more than play football.

== History ==

Skat was developed by the members of a local Tarock club, the &quot;Brommesche Tarok-Gesellschaft&quot; around 1810–1813 in Altenburg, in what is now the State of Thuringia, Germany.

Skat is based on the three-player Tarot game of Grosstarock and the four-player game of Schafkopf (forerunner of American Sheepshead). It has become the most loved and widely played German card game, especially in German-speaking regions. In the earliest known form of the game, the player in the first seat was dealt twelve cards and the other two players ten each. He then made two discards, constituting the &quot;Skat&quot;, and announced a contract. But the main innovation of this new game was that of the bidding process.

The earliest recorded rules for &quot;Scat&quot; date to 1835, by when it was already popular in the Kingdom of Saxony, especially in the Duchy of Altenburg and the surrounding area. These describe a game for 3 players with German-suited cards who received 10 each in packets of 3, 2, 3 and 2, the two remaining cards being dealt to the table as a talon known as the &quot;Scat&quot;. There were just two contracts – &quot;Frage&quot; and &quot;Solo&quot; – and forehand opened the bidding or passed. A &quot;Frage&quot; bidder could be overcalled by a &quot;Solo&quot; and either could be overcalled by the same contract in a higher-ranking suit, the suits ranking in the same order as in the modern game. The declarer needed 61 card points to win and there were bonuses for scoring 90 (&quot;Schneider&quot;), taking all tricks (&quot;Schwarz&quot;) and, optionally, for holding or lacking matadors in unbroken sequence from the top. The four Unters were permanent trumps ranking above the trump suit.

The first book on the rules of Skat, &quot;Das Scatspiel: Nebst zwei Liedern&quot;, was published in 1848 by one of its inventors, secondary school teacher J. F. L. Hempel. Nevertheless, the rules continued to differ from one region to another until the first attempt to set them in order was made by a congress of Skat players on 7 August 1886 in Altenburg. These were the first official rules finally published in a book form in 1888 by Theodor Thomas of Leipzig. The current rules, followed by both the International Skat Players Association, German Skat Federation and British Skat Association, date from Jan. 1, 1999.

The word Skat is a Tarock term derived from the Latin word &quot;scarto, scartare&quot;, which means to discard or reject, and its derivative &quot;scatola&quot;, a box or a place for safe-keeping. The word scarto is still used in some other Italian card games to this day. Skat is completely unrelated to an American game called Scat.

Nowadays, it is very popular to play the Skat game online through web browsers.

== Distribution ==
Skat is particularly popular in Germany. Tournament Skat is regularly held in restaurants. In contrast to most other card games, Skat is organized as a sport, with Skat associations, clubs, ranking lists and even a national league. Most German Skat clubs are affiliated to the German Skat Association (DSkV), which organizes the championships. In addition, the global organisation, the International Skat Players Association, is primarily responsible for organising the World and European Championships, but its subdivision, ISPA Germany, like the DSkV, organizes its own German individual and team championship and leagues, among other activities.

Skat is played on a lesser scale in countries bordering Germany including the Netherlands, Danish southern Jutland, Poland and Austria.

The member countries of ISPA are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, France, Germany, Namibia, Netherlands, Paraguay, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, UAE, Uruguay, and the USA.

== Rules ==
:&quot;Note: Because of the many variations in the rules of Skat, the rules below are necessarily general, although rules not found in official German tournament play are marked as such.&quot;

=== General principles ===
Skat is a game for three players, who are known as forehand, middlehand and rearhand, rearhand also being the dealer (&quot;see picture&quot;). At the beginning of each round, or &quot;deal&quot;, one player becomes &quot;declarer&quot; and the other two players become the &quot;defending team&quot;. The two defenders are not allowed to communicate in any way except by their choice of cards to play. The game can also be played by four players, in which case, the dealer sits out the round that was dealt, while the player to the right of the dealer will play the role taken by the dealer in the three-player variant. Players may agree at the outset how many rounds/deals they will play for.

A central aspect of the game is the three coexisting varieties called &quot;suit&quot;, &quot;grand&quot; and &quot;null&quot; games, that differ in suit order, scoring and even overall goal to achieve.

Each round of the game starts with a bidding phase to determine the declarer and the required minimum game value (explained below). Then, ten tricks are played, allowing players to take trick points. Each card has a card value (except in null games) and is worth that number of points for the player winning the trick. The total value of all cards is 120 points. The declarer&#x27;s goal is to take at least 61 points in tricks in order to win that round of the game. Otherwise, the defending team wins the round. Points from tricks are not directly added to the players&#x27; overall score, they are used only to determine the outcome of the game (win or loss for declarer), although winning by certain margins may increase the score for that round.

After each round a score is awarded in accordance with the game value. If the declarer wins they are awarded a positive score, if they lose the score is doubled and subtracted from the declarer&#x27;s tally (i.e. a negative score). In tournaments a winning declarer gets an additional 50 points if they win, if the defending team wins however they receive 40 points each in addition to the declarer losing twice the game&#x27;s value in points.

=== Cards ===

The pack consists of 32 cards. Many modern packs use the French pack consisting of an ace (&quot;Ass&quot;), king (&quot;König&quot;), queen (&quot;Dame&quot;), jack (&quot;Bube&quot;), 10, 9, 8 and 7 in all four suits (clubs , spades , hearts and diamonds ). Some players in Eastern and Southern Germany and Austria prefer traditional German packs with suits of acorns , leaves , hearts and bells , and card values of deuce (&quot;Daus&quot;), king (&quot;König&quot;), &quot;Ober&quot;, &quot;Unter&quot;, 10, 9, 8, and 7 in all four suits. Until recently in Saxony and Thuringia, for example, German-suited packs were used almost exclusively. By contrast, regions of the former West Germany had adopted a French-suited pack.

Since German reunification, a compromise &quot;Turnierbild&quot; (&quot;Tournament Style&quot;) pack is used in tournaments that uses the shapes of the French suits but with corresponding German suit colors, green spades imitating leaves and gold diamonds imitating bells. The choice of pack does not affect the rules.

=== Dealing ===
At the beginning of each round each player is dealt ten cards, with the two remaining cards (the so-called &quot;Skat&quot;) being put face down in the middle of the table. Dealing follows this pattern: deal three cards each, then deal the &quot;Skat&quot;, then four cards each, then three cards again (&quot;three–&quot;Skat&quot;–four–three&quot;). In four-player rounds, the dealer does not receive any cards and skips actual play of the round. He or she may peek into the hand of one other player (if allowed to do so) but never into the &quot;Skat&quot;.

Dealing rotates clockwise around the table, so that the player sitting to the left of the dealer will be dealer for the next round.

=== Bidding ===
After the cards have been dealt, and before the deal is played out, a bidding or auction () is held to decide:

* Who will be declarer for the round, and thus eligible for picking up the &quot;Skat&quot; and choosing whether to have trumps and what the trump suit is
* The minimum game value needed for declarer to win

The goal for each player during the bidding is to bid a game value as high as their card holding would allow, but never higher than necessary to win the bidding. How the actual game value is determined is explained in detail below and is necessary to understand in order to know how high one can safely bid.

It is possible for a player to overbid, which leads to an automatic loss of the game in question. Often this does not become obvious before the player picks up the &quot;Skat&quot;, or even not before the end of the game in question (in case of a &quot;hand&quot; game, when the &quot;Skat&quot; is not picked up). Players have therefore to exercise careful scrutiny during bidding, as not to incur an unnecessary loss.

The bidding may also give away some information about what cards a player may or may not hold. Experienced players will be able to use this to their advantage.

==== Game value ====
The game value (also called &quot;hand value&quot;, ) is what the game will be worth after all tricks have been played. It is determined not only by the 10 cards held, but also by the two-card &quot;Skat&quot;. The &quot;Skat&quot; always belongs to the declarer, and if it contains certain high cards this may change the game value. It is therefore not possible in general to determine the exact game value before knowing the &quot;Skat&quot;.

The game value is determined by the type of the game and the game level as explained below for the suit, grand and null games.

===== Suit game =====
In a suit game (), one of the four suits is the trump suit.

Each suit has a base value (), as follows:

This base value is then multiplied by the multiplier game level ( or ) to determine the game value, so:

:game value = base value × game level.

A game level of 1 for becoming declarer is always assumed. It is then increased by one for each of the following:

# For every matador i.e. trump (German: &quot;Spitzen&quot;) in unbroken sequence counting from the downwards. Example: 
#* Having all the jacks and the ace but not the 10 of the suit counts as &quot;with 5&quot;
# For every missing matador, if the is not held, in unbroken sequence from the top. Example:
#* Having the but no higher jack counts as &quot;without 3&quot;
# Playing a &quot;Hand&quot; game, i.e. without picking up the &quot;skat&quot;
# Winning &quot;schneider&quot;, i.e. taking 90 or more card points
# Winning &quot;schwarz&quot;, i.e. taking all tricks.

In case of a &quot;Hand&quot; game, the following special cases are allowed. Each one increases the game level by another point:

# &quot;Schneider&quot; is announced by declarer after the bidding
# &quot;Schwarz&quot; is announced by declarer after the bidding 
# &quot;Ouvert&quot;, where the declarer plays with open cards and takes all tricks; that is &quot;Schwarz&quot; has to be announced in order to declare &quot;Ouvert&quot; in a suit game

To summarize in tabular form:

Cards in the trump suit are ordered as follows (this is important to know when counting the length of the matador&#x27;s jack straight):

# Jack of clubs, or or (&quot;German pack:&quot; Unter of acorns/Acorn Unter)
# Jack of spades, or or (&quot;German pack:&quot; Unter of leaves/Green Unter)
# Jack of hearts, or or (&quot;German pack:&quot; Unter of hearts/Red Unter)
# Jack of diamonds, or or (&quot;German pack:&quot; Unter of bells/Bell Unter)
# Ace of trumps
# 10 of trumps
# King of trumps
# Queen of trumps (&quot;German pack:&quot; Ober)
# 9 of trumps
# 8 of trumps
# 7 of trumps

 is the highest-ranking card in a suit game and is called in German &quot;der Alte&quot; (&quot;the old man&quot;).

The non-trump suit cards are ranked A-10-K-Q-9-8-7 (or A-10-K-O-9-8-7 for the German pack respectively).

As mentioned above, the cards in the &quot;Skat&quot; are to be included when determining the multiplier game level (also in case of the &quot;Hand&quot; game, where the &quot;Skat&quot; is unknown until after the deal has been played out). During bidding, each player therefore has incomplete information regarding the true game value. The final game value is calculated by multiplying the base value for the suit by the multiplier game level:

===== Grand game =====
Grand game is a special case of suit game, in which only the Jacks are trumps in the same order as in the suit game:

# Jack of clubs, or or 
# Jack of spades, or or 
# Jack of hearts, or or 
# Jack of diamonds, or or 

All other cards are ranked the same as in a suit game: A-10-K-Q-9-8-7.

The base value for the grand game is 24 in the official rules. It used to be 20 until 1932, and many hobbyists continued to use 20 well into the postwar era.

All other rules for determining game value are as in a suit game, that is, the base value of 24 is multiplied by the multiplier game level.

===== Null game =====
In the null game, declarer promises not to take any tricks at all. There is no trump suit, 10s are sorted directly above 9s, and jacks are treated as normal suit cards sorted between 10 and queen. Thus the cards are ordered: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7. The game values of null games are fixed, as follows:

* 23 for a simple null game
* 35 for a &quot;Null Hand&quot; game (the &quot;Skat&quot; is not picked up by declarer)
* 46 for a &quot;Null Ouvert&quot; game (declarer plays with open cards)
* 59 for a &quot;Null Ouvert Hand&quot; game (combination of the above two)

===== Examples =====
The following examples give a player&#x27;s holding and the contents of the &quot;Skat&quot; (which will be unknown to all players during the bidding) and explain how to derive the game value.

Example 1

:Holding: 
:Skat: 

The length of matador&#x27;s jack straight will be 1 ( is present, is missing). The multiplier game level will be 2 (1 for matador&#x27;s jack straight plus 1 for becoming declarer).

The possible game value now depends on which game is declared, for example:

* With hearts as trumps (base value is 10), the game value is 20 (10 × 2).
** If the &quot;Skat&quot; is not picked up, the game value is 30 (the multiplier game level increases from 2 to 3 for declaring &quot;Hand&quot;).
** If declarer manages to win with at least 90 trick points, the game value will be 30 as well (the multiplier game level increases from 2 to 3 for achieving &quot;Schneider&quot;).
* In the grand game (base value is 24), the game value will be 48 (24 × 2).

Of course, many other possibilities exist.

Note that game value is dependent not only on the cards held (including the &quot;Skat&quot;) but also on which game is being declared and the outcome of the play. Each holding can thus be evaluated differently by different players. A risk-taking player might be willing to declare &quot;Hand&quot; on a holding on which another player might not—these two players will therefore give different valuations to the same holding. However, after all tricks have been played, it is always possible to determine the exact game value by combining the actual holding with the type of game and outcome of the play. Only then does it becomes apparent if declarer has won or lost (if the declarer overbid).

Example 2

:Holding: 
:Skat: 

Assuming a trump suit of hearts in a suit game, this holding will have a different valuation before and after the &quot;Skat&quot; has been examined.

Without knowledge of the &quot;Skat&quot; (assuming &quot;Hand&quot; is not declared)

* the multiplier game level is 4 (3 for the straight, plus 1 for becoming declarer)
* the base value is 10 (for Hearts being the trump suit)

This holding can be safely valuated at 40 (10 × 4), regardless of the &quot;Skat&quot;. With Hearts as trump, the game value will always be at least that much.

Now, assuming declarer wins by taking 95 points in tricks, after having declared &quot;Hand&quot; and &quot;Schneider&quot;, the actual game value will be as follows:

* The base value is 10 (for Hearts being the trump suit)
* The multiplier game level is 11
** 1 for becoming declarer
** 7 for the straight of 
** 1 for declaring &quot;Hand&quot;
** 1 for declaring &quot;Schneider&quot;
** 1 for achieving &quot;Schneider&quot; (at least 90 points in tricks taken)
* The actual game value will be 110 (10 × 11)

The player could have bid up to that value (110) during the bidding. In practice this would have been too risky because only in the &quot;Skat&quot; increased the length of matador&#x27;s jack straight to 7.

Note: Most players will declare a grand game with the above hand, as it will be much more lucrative than a suit game in Hearts (declarer will concede at most two club tricks, probably achieving &quot;Schneider&quot; for a game value of at least 144 (24 × 6).

===== More examples =====
* : with 2, plus 1 is 3.
* : with 1 (counting interrupted by the missing ), plus 1 is 2.
* with 4, plus 1 is 5.
* : Without 2, plus 1 is 3.
* alone: This is also without 2 (counting is interrupted by the present ), plus 1 is 3.

Now for the special cases: if you think you can do more than just win, you can add points for the special cases.

* : With 2, plus 1 (game) plus 1 (for &quot;Hand&quot;) is 4.
* : With 2, plus 1 (game) plus 1 (for &quot;Schneider&quot;) is 4.
* : With 2, plus 1 (game) plus 1 (for &quot;Hand&quot;) plus 1 (for &quot;Schneider&quot;) plus 1 (for &quot;Schwarz&quot;) is 6.
* : With 2, game 3, &quot;Hand&quot; 4, &quot;Schneider&quot; 5, pre-declared &quot;Schneider&quot; 6, &quot;Schwarz&quot; 7, pre-declared &quot;Schwarz&quot; 8, &quot;Ouvert&quot; 9.

The highest possible multiplier game level is 18: that is with (or without) four jacks and all seven cards of trump suit (including those in the &quot;Skat&quot;, if any) 11, plus the maximum of 7 for becoming declarer, &quot;Hand&quot;, &quot;Schneider&quot;, declaring &quot;Schneider&quot;, &quot;Schwarz&quot;, declaring &quot;Schwarz&quot; and &quot;Ouvert&quot;. The lowest possible multiplier game level is 2: either with , or without and with 1, plus 1 for becoming declarer.

==== Bidding mechanics ====
===== Order of bidding =====
The order of bidding is determined by the seating order. Starting from the left of the dealer players are numbered clockwise: the first seat (), the second seat () and the third seat (). In a three-player game, the dealer will be the third seat. In a four-player game the third seat will be to the right of the dealer.

Bidding starts by the player in second seat making a call to the player in first seat on which the latter can &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;pass&quot;. If the first seat player holds, the second seat player can make a higher call or pass himself. This continues until either of the two players passes. The player in third seat is then allowed to continue making calls to the player who has not yet passed. Bidding ends as soon as at least two players have passed. It is also possible for all three players to pass.

The starting order can be memorized as “deal–respond–call–continue” (). The player who continues in this mnemonic is either the dealer (in a three-player game) or the player in third seat. The mnemonic is commonly used among casual players.

Example: Anna, Bernard and Clara are playing, and seated in that order around the table. Anna deals the cards. Clara makes the first call to Bernard, who passes right away. Anna then makes two more calls to Clara, who accepts both bids. Anna then passes as well. The bidding ends, with Clara being the declarer for this round.

===== Possible calls =====
The calling player (i.e. the player currently calling the bids) may either

* “pass”, leaving the bidding and forfeiting the chance to become declarer in this round, or
* bid any possible game value that is higher than the highest bid made so far in this round.

The responding player (i.e. the player currently responding to the bidder) may either

* “pass”, leaving the bidding and forfeiting the chance to become declarer in this round, or
* “accept” or &quot;yes&quot;, staying in the bidding and waiting for further calls.
Responder must wait for caller to bid or pass before passing herself.

Except for &quot;pass&quot;, only the possible game values are legal calls. Therefore, the lowest possible call is 18, which is the lowest possible game value in Skat. Players are free to skip intermediate values, although it is common to always pick the lowest available call while bidding.

The sequence of possible double digit game values, beginning with 18 is 18—20—22—23—24—27—30—33—35—36—40—44—45—46—48—50—54—55—59—60—63—66—70—72—77—80—81—84—88—90—96—99 (triple digit bids are possible albeit rare in a competitive bidding). Among German players the values representing null games, especially 23, the most common one, are often replaced by the call “null”. Also, numbers are frequently abbreviated by only calling the lower digit of a value not divisible by 10 (e.g. “two” instead of “22” or “five” instead of “45”); this is unambiguous if values are always called out in order and intermediate values never skipped, as is the custom. (As the German words for &quot;null&quot; and &quot;zero&quot; are identical, this yields the rather unintuitive sequence 18—20—2—0—4—7—30 and so on.)

===== Passing out =====
If all players pass, the hand is not played and the next dealer shuffles and deals. A dealer never deals twice in a row.

It is common in informal play to play a variant of Skat called &quot;Ramsch&quot; (junk, rummage) instead of skipping the hand and dealing for the next one. The objective in that variant is to make no &quot;trick&quot; as their points would score negatively. This is not part of the sanctioned rules, however.

In a pass-out game, the player in first seat will be the last one to pass. If that player intends to become declarer, however, he or she has to make a call of at least 18 (picking up the &quot;Skat&quot; in that situation implies the call).

===== Example bidding =====
Players Anna, Bernard and Clara are seated in that order, clockwise; Anna is the dealer. The bidding proceeds as follows:

# Clara: &quot;18&quot;
# Bernard: &quot;Yes&quot;
# Clara: &quot;20&quot;
# Bernard: &quot;Yes&quot;
# Clara: &quot;22&quot;
# Bernard: &quot;Pass&quot;
# Anna: &quot;23&quot;
# Clara: &quot;Yes&quot;
# Anna: &quot;24&quot;
# Clara: &quot;Yes&quot;
# Anna: &quot;Pass&quot;
On this deal, Clara will be declarer with a final bid of 24 (the highest accepted bid).

=== Declaring ===
The winner of the bidding becomes declarer and will play against the other two players. Before the hand is played, declarer either

* picks up the &quot;Skat&quot;, combines it with the hand cards, then puts two cards back face down on the table () or
* declares &quot;Hand&quot; (in this case the &quot;Skat&quot; remains face down on the table).

In either case the two cards in the &quot;Skat&quot; count towards declarer&#x27;s trick points.

After putting two cards back into the &quot;Skat&quot;, declarer then either declares a suit game by announcing a trump suit, declares a grand game or a null game.

If &quot;Hand&quot; has been declared, the player may make additional announcements such as &quot;Schneider&quot;, &quot;Schwarz&quot; and &quot;Ouvert&quot;.

==== Variants ====
A common variant in non-sanctioned play allows the defenders to announce &quot;&quot;Kontra&quot; just before the first trick is played, if they have made or held at least one call. In this case, the stakes will be doubled for the hand. Declarer, in turn, may announce “&quot;Re&quot;”, to redouble the stakes. In a less common further variation this process can be repeated twice more by announcing &quot;Supra&quot; and &quot;Resupra&quot; (or more colloquially, &quot;Bock&quot; &quot;[(roe) buck]&quot; and &quot;Hirsch&quot; &quot;[red deer]&quot;, or the like, which are colloquial augments of &quot;Reh&quot;&quot; &quot;roe deer&quot;).

=== Playing ===
The player in the first seat sitting to the left of the dealer leads to the first trick. The other two follow in clockwise direction. Every player plays one card to the trick, which is in the middle of the table. The winner of a trick stacks the cards face down in front of him and leads to the next trick, which is again played clockwise.

Completed tricks are kept face down in front of the players who won them, until all the cards have been played. Examining completed tricks (except for the last one) is not allowed. The tricks of the two players who are playing together are put together, either during or after play.

==== Suit game ====
The players must play a card in the same suit as the first card of the trick, if possible (“following suit”). A player who cannot follow suit may play any card (including a trump card). Trumps, including all four jacks, count as a single suit. If a trump is led, every player must also play a trump if able.

If there are trump cards in the trick, the highest trump in it wins the trick. If there are no trumps in it, the highest card of the suit led wins the trick.

The non-trump suit cards rank in order A-10-K-Q-9-8-7. The trumps rank the same way with the four jacks on top in the order , , , .

==== Grand game ====
In the grand game, only the four jacks are trumps in the suit order given above for a regular suit game. All other ranks are the same as in the regular suit game (10 is ranked just below the ace). There are thus five &quot;suits&quot; in the grand game (if a jack is led to a trick, the other two players must play jacks too, if they have them).

==== Null game ====
In a null game there is no trump suit, and in each suit the cards are ranked A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7.

The goal of a null game is for declarer not to take any tricks. If declarer takes a trick in a null game, the game is immediately lost and scored.

==== Conceding and claiming ====
Declarer may, unilaterally, concede a loss while holding at least nine cards (i.e. before playing to the second trick). Afterwards approval of at least one defender is required. Defenders may concede at any time, but may be requested by declarer to complete the play (e.g. if declarer thinks that &quot;Schneider&quot; or &quot;Schwarz&quot; is still possible).

Claiming of remaining tricks is possible as well, but for a defender only if she would be able to take the remaining tricks herself.

A game in which the necessary trick points have been won can not be lost, regardless of claims.

=== Counting and scoring === 
After the last trick has been played, the game is scored. Winning conditions for null game are different from suit and grand games.

==== Winning conditions for declarer ====
To win a suit or grand game, declarer needs at least 61 card points in tricks. If declarer announced &quot;Schneider&quot;, at least 90 card points are needed in order to win. The two cards in the &quot;Skat&quot; count towards declarer&#x27;s tricks. If declarer announced &quot;Schwarz&quot;, all ten tricks must be taken to win.

The highest-ranking cards for taking the tricks (the jacks) are not the highest scoring cards. The aces and 10s combined make up almost three quarters of the total points; taking as many as possible of them is thus imperative for winning. On the other hand, taking 7s, 8s and 9s – the blanks (&quot;Luschen&quot;) – doesn&#x27;t help (or hurt) at all, unless &quot;Schwarz&quot; was declared.

To win a null game, the declarer must not take any tricks. Null games are often not played to the end, either because declarer is forced to take a trick, ending the game prematurely, or because it becomes apparent to the defenders that they will be forced to take the rest of the tricks. There are no card points in a null game.

===== Overbid hands =====
Even with the majority in card points, declarer may still lose if the game value is lower than the value bid during the auction. This is called &quot;overbidding&quot;. An overbid hand is automatically lost, leading to a negative score for declarer.

An overbid hand is scored by determining the lowest possible game value that is a multiple of the base value of declarer&#x27;s suit (or 24 in case of a grand) which is at least as high as declarer&#x27;s bid. This value is then doubled and subtracted from declarer&#x27;s score (negative score).

Example: Declarer bids 30, missing the two top trumps (without 2), intending to play a club suit game (game value would be 12 × 3 = 36). They then find the in the &quot;Skat&quot; (with 1). Their game value is now only 24 (12 × 2) — they have overbid. Unless they manage to play at least &quot;Schneider&quot; (raising the game value to 36), or make a game other than clubs with a game value of at least 30, the game will be lost. They will receive a negative score of −72 (36 is the lowest multiple of 12, the base value of clubs, greater than the 30 they bid; 36 times two is 72). They can try to minimize their loss by declaring a game in Hearts instead of Clubs (base value 10 instead of 12). This will be worth only −60 points, unless opponents score &quot;Schneider&quot; against them.

==== Scoring ====
The score is always assigned to the declarer (positive or negative) in the classical scoring system.

The score to be awarded is the actual game value. How high the player bid during the bidding is immaterial, as long as the game value is at least as high as declarer&#x27;s bid (see Overbid Hands above). Note that often the score will be higher than the bidding value, because players typically do not bid as high as their hand would allow.

For a won game, that score is added to declarer&#x27;s tally. For a lost game, the score is doubled and subtracted from declarer&#x27;s tally (negative score).

Until 1998, lost &quot;Hand&quot; games did not count double, but this rule was dropped in that year. The reason was that in tournament play nearly all games played were &quot;Hand&quot; games. This increased the game level by one, but did not penalize as much as a normal game would have if lost.

In league games, 50 points get added for each game that is won by the declarer and 40 points each get added to the tally of the defending team shall they win to lower the chance factor and to stress the skill factor. In that situation, it becomes far more important for each player to bid his or her hand as high as possible.

Example 1: Anton is declarer. He bids 20 and declares a grand game. He then wins with 78 points in tricks. Declarer held . The game value is 24 × (2 + 1) = 72 points. These are awarded to the declarer.

Example 2: Brigitte is declarer. She bids 30 and declares a &quot;Null Ouvert&quot; game. She, however, is forced to take the ninth trick, losing the game. The game value is 46, it will be doubled and subtracted from her total score (−92 points).

== Variations ==
=== Ramsch ===
Ramsch (&quot;junk&quot;) is not part of sanctioned Skat rules, but is widely practiced in hobbyist rounds, and is the variant most often suggested to be officially sanctioned. It is played if all three players pass in the bidding. There is no declarer in &quot;Ramsch&quot;; every player plays for himself, and the goal is to achieve as &quot;low&quot; a score as possible. The idea behind &quot;Ramsch&quot; is to punish players who underbid their hands.

To make &quot;Ramsch&quot; more interesting, an additional rule is often played that adds a second winning condition: the &quot;Ramsch&quot; is also won by a player if that player manages to take &quot;all&quot; tricks ( i.e. &quot;march&quot;). At first, this seems to be not too difficult, since the other players will initially try to take as few tricks as possible and to get rid of their high-ranking cards. Once they get suspicious, however, they may thwart the effort simply by taking one trick from the player trying for the &quot;Durchmarsch&quot;.

Suit ranks in &quot;Ramsch&quot; are the same as in the &quot;Grand&quot; game, with only the four Jacks being trumps.

Hobby players often add the following rule: 10s are lower in trick taking power than Queens and Kings, but still count as ten points. Sometimes, they only count one point. There are a couple of variants to the rules concerning 10s, so this should be sorted out before starting the game. Often, the players are allowed to check and exchange cards with the skat, or decline to do so and pass the skat on to the next player, doubling the score (known as &quot;Schieberamsch&quot;). Jacks are not allowed to be passed on in this variation. The two cards in the &quot;Skat&quot; are usually added to the tricks of the player who takes the last trick. After all ten tricks are played, the player with the highest number of card points (or alternatively, every player) has their card points amount deducted from their score as negative game points. If one player takes no tricks at all (&quot;Jungfrau&quot;, ), the points of the losing hand are doubled. Some players also give a fixed value of 15 negative points to the loser and if there are two &quot;virgins&quot;, 20.

Another variation used in smaller tournaments is the Gewinner-Ramsch (&quot;winner-rubbish&quot;). If none of the players bid a Ramsch is played. Unlike the original negative game the winner is who achieves the lowest score and is awarded 23 points, the score of a won Null. Additionally they are awarded the won game. The skat is given to the player with the highest score. If two players achieve the same lowest score they will both be awarded the 23 points and the won game. While not very widely spread this variation is a nice addition as it rewards the player who most rightfully did not bid.

=== Pinke ===
Playing with a &quot;Pinke&quot; means playing for money instead of just points. This is often used in club play or regular rounds where the loser(s) pay the money into a pot which goes to a fund to pay for an end-of-season outing or meal. Sometimes it refers to a custom whereby a declarer who loses pays into a pot which is claimed by the next winner of Grand Hand.

=== Revolution ===
Revolution is a Null Hand game during which the defenders are allowed to confer and exchange cards, sometimes with a limit of two cards. It is valued at 92 points which goes against the normal Skat principle that positive games should outrank negative ones since it is higher than a simple Grand Hand.
=== Sechserskat ===
Sechserskat is played with a 36-card pack i.e. with the addition of the Sixes. It is mentioned as early as 1920.

== Three-player variants ==
=== Bierskat ===
Also known as &quot;Bierlachs&quot;, &quot;Bierskat&quot; (&quot;Beer Skat&quot;) is a variant that is common in German pubs. A target score is set, typically 501, and only negative scores are recorded i.e. if the declarer wins with 33 points, the score is recorded as -33 to the two defenders. The first to -501 loses and buys the next round.
=== Idiotenskat ===
Idiotenskat (&quot;Idiot Skat&quot;) is an amusing variant in which players play with their hands facing their opponents, so they are only able to see their opponents&#x27; cards. The game is recorded as early as 1958.

=== Räuberskat ===
Räuberskat (&quot;Robber Skat&quot;) is a variant in which there is no bidding; instead there is a sequence of specified contracts. In turn the players must play a suit game, Grand, Null and Ramsch, once each. After viewing his or her first 5 cards, the soloist must choose one of the contracts and the game ends when all have played their four contracts i.e. after 12 deals if three play. It is considered useful for beginnings with little experience of bidding, but also an interesting alternative for experienced players. It should not be confused with the two-player variant, sometimes also called &quot;Räuberskat&quot;.

== Two-player variants ==
There are several variants of Skat for two players:

=== Officers&#x27; Skat ===
&quot;Officers&#x27; Skat&quot; () is a variant for two players. Each player receives 16 cards on the table in front of him in two rows, 8 face down and 8 face up on top of them. Bidding is replaced by the non-dealer declaring a game type and trump. When a face-up card is played, the hidden card is turned over. Each deal results in a total of 16 tricks and players must agree whether a game lasts for a certain number of deals or until one player scores a certain number of game points. Scoring is similar to normal Skat.

=== Oma Skat ===
Oma Skat is also played with a third, or dummy, hand called &quot;Oma&quot; (&quot;Grandma&quot;). However, in this case, the hand is not exposed. Instead it is placed in a stack, face down, and the top card of the stack is played to the trick each time. Thus Oma need not follow suit. 

=== Piloten-Skat ===
In Piloten-Skat (&quot;Pilots&#x27; Skat&quot;) bidding takes place as if there were 3 players. Again the defender plays with the third hand against the soloist. After the first card is led, the third hand is exposed and played by the defender with a strawman.
It is possible to play a modified version of the game with only two players. The cards that would be dealt to a third player are simply laid down as a “dummy” hand instead and not used.

=== Strawman ===
In Strawman Skat (&quot;Skat mit einem Strohmann&quot; or &quot;Strohmann&quot;), players are dealt 9 cards each, one hand being the straw man. There is a second skat of 3 cards that remains unused throughout the hand. After the first trick, the straw man is exposed and is played by the defender. The second skat goes, at the end, to the player who scores the most points.

=== Skat En Deux ===
In Skat En Deux, the dealer bids against the non-dealer, opening with &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;18&quot; as normal. If he passes, the non-dealer may pass or bid. Ten cards are dealt each, the spare hand going to the right of the dealer each time. This hand is played by the defender. After announcing his or her game, the defender exposes the third hand to the declarer. Thus, it is possible to predict what hand the opponent has and play much more strategically. It is sometimes used to teach new players the principles of Skat.

=== Schmegegge Skat ===
In Schmegegge Skat declarer plays against defender and a half-dummy that is played by defender. The dummy is considered its own hand, but scores with the defender. The dummy always has five cards exposed, and after each trick a new card for the dummy gets turned up, so there&#x27;s always five. Play generally follows Skat but Ramsch uses 2 card tricks with dummy out of play: if both players pass initially, two cards of dummy are revealed for information, and if both pass a second time, they play 2-card tricks after a chance to exchange two cards unseen with dummy.

== Four-player variant ==

There are several variants of Skat for 4 players, but the most popular is &quot;Geberskat&quot;, where the rules are the same as standard 3-player Skat, except that the dealer doesn&#x27;t play for the round.

== North American Skat==
:&quot;Note: North American Skat is not related to the American game Scat&quot;

Skat in the United States and Canada was played for many years as an older version of the game, also known as Tournee Skat, which was based on the original German game that used suit bidding rather than point bidding. However, the old Frage contracts, which involved picking up the skat, were dropped apart from Grand Guckser. Suit bidding was officially dropped in Germany in after the First World War as a result of soldiers popularising the point bidding game. In addition, the Tourné bids were dropped and the Frage contracts retained. Otherwise Tournee Skat shares many of its rules with its modern European counterpart. Today Tournee Skat is declining in popularity and most tournament Skat players in North America play the modern game described above.

=== Contracts ===
The contracts in Tournee Skat are:

; Tourné: To determine trump, declarer picks up one card of the skat and looks at it. If declarer wants this card&#x27;s suit as trump, the card is shown to the other players. Otherwise the hand is played as Passt mir nicht (it doesn&#x27;t suit me) and the other card in the skat is turned up to determine trump. A jack gives declarer the choice of either playing grand (jacks only) or the jack&#x27;s suit as trump. Once trump has been determined, both the skat cards are added to declarer&#x27;s hand and then two are removed and placed face down to begin his or her pile of cards won.
; Solo: The skat remains on the table and declarer names trump in any suit or grand. Grand may also be played &quot;ouvert&quot; with declarer&#x27;s hand spread face up for all player to see.
; Grand Guckser: Declarer picks up both of the skat cards, adds them to his or her hand and discards two. Game is played with grand trumps. &quot;Grand Guckser&quot; is the only game in North American Skat where declarer picks up both skat cards at once.
; Null: The skat remains untouched and declarer wagers to take no tricks. In null, cards rank A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7. If declarer takes a trick, then the hand is lost and a new deal commences. Null may also be played &quot;ouvert&quot;.
; Ramsch: If middlehand (&quot;Mittelhand&quot;) and rearhand (&quot;Hinterhand&quot;) both pass, forehand (&quot;Vorhand&quot;) may not pass, but if he does not wish to bid may declare &quot;ramsch&quot; in which players each play for themselves in trying to take the fewest tricks with grand as trumps. The skat is not used.

Upon determining the game, declarer may also state that he or she intends to Schneider or Schwarz for extra game points or penalties.

=== Scoring ===
Card points are the same as in German Skat: A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3. J=2 and all other cards have no value. The game points, however, are a bit different. Base value for the different games are as follows:

* Tournée: 5, 6, ♠ 7, ♣ 8, Grand 12. If a &quot;tournée&quot; is played &quot;Paßt mir nicht&quot; and declarer does not make 61 card points, then the game point penalty is doubled.
* Solo: 9, 10, ♠ 11, ♣ 12, Grand 20, Grand Ouvert 24.
* Grand Guckser: 16, 32 if lost.
* Null: 20, 40 if played &quot;ouvert&quot;.
* Ramsch: player taking the fewest card points wins 10 game points, or 20 for taking zero tricks. A player taking every trick loses 30 and other players do not win any.

As in German Skat, game points in North American Skat are tallied by multiplying base game value by:

* 1 for each top trump, either with or without, plus:
** 1 for game (61 or more card points).
** 2 for &quot;Schneider&quot; (91 or more card points).
** 3 for &quot;Schwarz&quot; (winning every trick).
* If &quot;Schneider&quot; was declared add 1.
* If &quot;Schwarz&quot; was declared add 2.

Note that if &quot;Schneider&quot; or &quot;Schwarz&quot; are declared but not made, then the contract is not met and declarer loses the amount that he or she would have won if successful. The above multipliers do not figure into games played &quot;null&quot; or &quot;ramsch&quot;.

== Organization of players ==
League games are organized worldwide:

* By the International Skat Players Association 
* In North America by ISPA Canada and ISPA USA 
* Within Germany by the German Skat Association. 
* Within Britain by the British Skat Association. 
* In East Asia by Asian Skat Masters 
* Online by the German Skat Union 
* Local clubs may organise Preisskat competitions

In the event of disputes, players may appeal to the International Skat Court in Altenburg.

<doc id="162669" wikidata="Q774343" url="?curid=162669" title="Makaton">
<text>Makaton is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) system which uses signs (hand gestures) and symbols (images) alongside speech &amp; written words to support communication. Despite its use of signs, Makaton is not a sign language. 

Makaton is used by hearing people with communication challenges and learning disabilities to communicate and supports the development of essential communication skills such as attention, listening, comprehension, memory and expressive speech and language. The Makaton language programme has been used with individuals who have cognitive impairments, autism, Down syndrome, specific language impairment, multisensory impairment and acquired neurological disorders that have negatively affected the ability to communicate, including stroke and dementia patients.

The name &quot;Makaton&quot; is derived from the names of three members of the original teaching team at Botleys Park Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey: Margaret Walker (the designer of the programme and speech therapist at Botleys Park), Katherine Johnston and Tony Cornforth (psychiatric hospital visitors from the Royal Association for Deaf People).

Makaton is a registered trademark of The Makaton Charity, which was established in 2007 to replace the original charitable trust, the Makaton Vocabulary Development Project, established in 1983. The original trademark application for Makaton was filed in Britain on 28 August 1979, with registration approved as from that date under trademark registration no. 1119745.

==Programme==
The Makaton Language Programme uses a multimodal approach to teach communication, language and, where appropriate literacy skills, through a combination of speech, signs, and graphic symbols used concurrently, or, only with speech with signs, or, only with speech with graphic symbols as appropriate for the student&#x27;s needs. It consists of a Core Vocabulary of roughly 450 concepts that are taught in a specific order (there are eight different stages). For example, stage one involves teaching vocabulary for immediate needs, like &quot;eat&quot; and &quot;drink&quot;. 

Later stages contain more complex and abstract vocabulary such as time and emotions. Once basic communication has been established, the student can progress in their language use, using whatever modes are most appropriate. Also, although the programme is organised in stages, it can be modified and tailored to the individual&#x27;s needs. In addition to the Core Vocabulary, there is a Makaton Resource Vocabulary of over 11,000 concepts which are illustrated with signs and graphic symbols.

==Development==
Original research was conducted by Margaret Walker in 1972/73, and resulted in the design of the Makaton Core Vocabulary based on functional need. This research was conducted with institutionalised deaf cognitively impaired adults resident at Botleys Park Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey (which closed in 2008). The aim was to enable them to communicate using signs from British Sign Language. Fourteen deaf and cognitively impaired adults participated in the pilot study, and all were able to learn to use manual signs; improved behaviour was also noted. Shortly after, the Core Vocabulary was revised to include both children and adults with severe communication difficulties (including individuals who could hear), and was used in many schools throughout Britain in order to stimulate communication and language.

In the early stages of development, Makaton used only speech and manual signs (without symbols). By 1985, work had begun to include graphic symbols in the Makaton Language Programme and a version including graphic symbols was published in 1986. The Core Vocabulary was revised in 1986 to include additional cultural concepts.

The Makaton Vocabulary Development Project was founded in 1976 by Margaret Walker, who worked in a voluntary capacity as director until her retirement in October 2008. The first Makaton training workshop was held in 1976 and supporting resources and further training courses were, and continue to be, developed. In 1983 the Makaton Vocabulary Development Project became a charitable trust, and in 2007 it changed its status to become the Makaton Charity.

== Use ==
Makaton is used extensively across Britain and has been adapted for use in different countries; signs from each country&#x27;s deaf community are used, along with culturally relevant Makaton symbols. For example, within Britain, Makaton uses signs from British Sign Language; the signs are mainly from the London and South East England regional dialect. 

Makaton has also been adapted for use in over 40 countries, including France, Greece, Japan, Kuwait and the Gulf, Russia, South Africa and Switzerland. Using signs from each country&#x27;s own existing sign language ensures that they reflect each country&#x27;s unique culture and also provide a bank of further signs if required for use with Makaton.

In 1991 The Makaton Charity produced a video/DVD of children&#x27;s familiar nursery rhymes, signed, spoken and sung by a well-known children&#x27;s TV presenter, Dave Benson Phillips, who had previously used Makaton with poems and rhymes in the Children&#x27;s BBC show &quot;Playdays&quot;. The aim was for it to be enjoyed by children with developmental disabilities and their peers and siblings. Following this major success, in 2003 it became a significant part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Something Special&quot; programmes on the CBeebies programme thread, presented by Justin Fletcher as &quot;Mr Tumble&quot;, which has won numerous awards and is now into its thirteenth series.

On 16 November 2018, comedian Rob Delaney read a book on the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s channel CBeebies entirely in Makaton and English; he had used Makaton to communicate with his late son Henry, who was rendered unable to talk after a tracheotomy.

== Criticism ==
Members of the Deaf community, including the British Deaf Association, have been critical of Makaton. A 2022 statement by the British Deaf Association decried the rapid growth of social media posts using &quot;sign supported communication systems&quot; such as Makaton and Signalong, emphasizing the limited nature of these non-languages. The statement argued that it would make more sense to teach both hearing and deaf children signs from British Sign Language, enabling them to communicate with the Deaf community. Scholarly critique of Makaton has included questioning of its methodology of sign selection and usage, and suggestions that the &quot;teaching method and vocabulary structure were highly restrictive and, if not revised, might impede communication skill development with some children.&quot; Other considerations focus on the proprietary nature of Makaton, believing that protecting the integrity of the signs &amp; symbols with Copyright restricts access to Makaton.

<text>The 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts) (26th CAV (PS)) was part of U.S. Army Forces Far East&#x27;s Philippine Department, during World War II. The 26th engaged in the last cavalry charge in the history of the U.S. cavalry. The American Battle Monuments Commission list 301 dead who were members of this regiment interred at Manila American Cemetery and Memorial.

== Formation ==

The 26th Cavalry Regiment was constituted in the Regular Army on 1 October 1922 and assigned to the Philippine Department. It was concurrently activated at Fort Stotsenburg by transfer of personnel from the 25th Field Artillery Regiment (PS) and 43rd Infantry Regiment (PS), with equipment and horses taken from the 9th Cavalry Regiment when that regiment transferred to Fort Riley, Kansas, on 12 October 1922. The entire regiment was based at Fort Stotsenburg, with the exception of Troop F, which was based at Nichols Field. In addition to the horse-mounted troops, the regiment had a Headquarters Troop, Machine Gun Troop, and a platoon of six Indiana White M1 scout cars, and trucks for transporting its service elements. The regiment was reorganized on 1 December 1927 as a three-squadron regiment. Troops C and G were inactivated on 6 March 1928 at Fort Stotsenburg. Concurrently, the 2nd Machine Gun Troop was redesignated the Machine Gun Troop, 26th Cavalry. The regiment conducted a river crossing exercise in May 1933 on the Rio Grande de Mindanao and Hagonoy Rivers. Troops C and G were activated on 15 March 1941 at Fort Stotsenburg. The 26th Cavalry was the primary
reconnaissance force for the Philippine Department, and was assigned the task of performing the covering force mission from Lingayen Gulf to the Bataan Peninsula. On 30 November 1941, the regiment had 787 enlisted men and 55 officers, and its commander was Colonel (later Brigadier General) Clinton A. Pierce (USA).

==World War II combat history==
===Northern and central Luzon===

Following the 1941 Japanese invasion, the 26th participated in the Allied withdrawal to the Bataan Peninsula. In doing so, the unit conducted a classic delaying action that allowed other, less mobile, units to safely withdraw to the peninsula. During the delaying action the 26th provided the &quot;stoutest&quot; and only &quot;serious opposition&quot; to the Japanese; the majority of the units sent north towards Lingayen Gulf were divisions (11th, 21st, 71st, &amp; 91st Infantry Divisions) of the untrained and poorly equipped Philippine Army. For instance, during the initial landings the regiment alone delayed the advance of four Japanese infantry regiments for six hours at Damortis, and on 24 December repulsed a tank assault at Binalonan. However, the resistance was not without cost, as by the end of 24 December the regiment had been reduced to 450 men. Following these events, the regiment was pulled off the line and brought back up to a strength of 657 men, who in January 1942 held open the roadways to the Bataan Peninsula allowing other units to prepare for their stand there.

===Bataan===
The 26th Cavalry Regiment, consisting mostly of Philippine Scouts, was the last U.S. cavalry regiment to engage in horse-mounted warfare. When Troop G encountered Japanese forces at the village of Morong on 16 January 1942, Lieutenant Edwin P. Ramsey ordered, for that time, the last cavalry charge in American history. It would not be until 22 October 2001, when American Soldiers would enter combat on horseback again, when members of the 12-man Operational Detachment Alpha 595 (Green Berets), accompanying members of the Afghanistan Northern Alliance, rode into battle at Cōbaki in Balkh Province.

During the retreat to Bataan, the 26th was heavily outnumbered by an infantry force supported by tanks. They drove off the surprised Japanese. Due to a shortage of food, they found it necessary to butcher their mounts and the regiment was converted to two squadrons, one a motorized rifle squadron, the other a mechanized squadron utilizing the remaining scout cars and Bren carriers.

=== Order of Battle 1942 ===

* Headquarters, 26th Cavalry Regiment (PS) - Captain Paul Montgomery Jones
** 1st Scout Car Platoon - 1st Lieutenant Carol I. Cahoo, USA
** Recon Patrol - Captain Charles Bowers
* 1st Squadron - Major Hubert Ketchum | Captain William E. Chandler
** Troop A - 1st Lieutenant Hugh Stevenson
** Troop B - Captain Theodore Hurt, Jr. | Captain Joseph Rhett Barker
** Troop C - 1st Lieutenant William Gordon Bartlett | 1st Lieutenant Raph Prague
** Troop D
* 2nd Squadron - Major Thomas Trapnell, USA
** Troop E
** Troop F - 1st Lieutenant William Gordon Bartlett
** Troop G - 1st Lieutenant Edwin Ramsay
** Troop H

===Guerrilla activities===

Following the delaying action down the central Luzon plain, Troop C was cut off from the rest of the regiment, having been ordered into Northern Luzon in an attempt to defend Baguio by Major General Wainwright in late December 1941. In January 1942, the unit, with assistance from 71st Infantry and elements of the 11th Infantry, raided Tuguegarao Airfield, destroying several planes, and killing multiple Japanese soldiers. Eventually the unit was supplemented by other soldiers and guerrillas, and remained an effective fighting force well into 1943. The remnants of Troop C would later be integrated into the United States Army Forces in the Philippines – Northern Luzon, which due to deaths and captures would be led by Russell W. Volckmann. Other guerrilla organizations were led by officers of the regiment, who ignored the surrender orders, or by enlisted men who escaped from Bataan. However, those organizations did not have a direct connection to the regiment, as the Cagayan-Apayao Forces did.

The regiment was inactivated in 1946 and disbanded in 1951.

<doc id="162679" wikidata="Q6807869" url="?curid=162679" title="Meet the Wife (TV series)">
<text>Meet the Wife is a 1960s BBC sitcom written by Chesney and Wolfe, which featured Freddie Frinton as Freddie Blacklock with Thora Hird as his tyrannical wife, Thora. It ran for five series.

The series was based on a 1963 BBC television &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; production, &quot;The Bed&quot;. The theme tune was by Russ Conway and incidental music by Norman Percival and later Dennis Wilson. The producers were John Paddy Carstairs and later Robin Nash.

==Outline==
The series followed the various ups and downs of a middle-aged married couple, Freddie and Thora Blacklock. Of the two, Fred played the &quot;straight man&quot;, weary under Thora&#x27;s nagging. He was a plumber who liked a bit of betting and a drink before coming home. His wife, Thora, was noted for her incessant talking while giving her husband a hard time. The couple had at least two children, one named Peter who was 23 and married.

Apart from one, the catchphrases of the series belonged to Thora. The first occurred whenever the socially-aspiring Thora introduced her husband, when she would snobbishly pronounce his name &quot;Frayed&quot;, remarking that he was &quot;a Master plumber&quot;, with the emphasis on the word &quot;Master&quot;. The other was to throw an irate accusative tantrum at poor, downtrodden Fred, with the words, &quot;Every time [such-and-such happens], you always go berserk&quot; The word &quot;berserk&quot; was given great emphasis, as &quot;Ber-Serk&quot;, and always had a successful comedic effect as Fred would wilt under the onslaught. She would also answer the phone with an affected &quot;Hellewe&quot;, generally half way through an angry rant at Fred.

Fred also had a catchphrase; always uttering an affected, over-the-top, supposed-upper class &quot;Yai-sss&quot;, accompanied by tilted head, sycophantic smile and rapid eye-blinking, in response to Thora&#x27;s request for confirmation (e.g. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that right, Fred?&quot;) on some point she was making to any member of the group she was aspiring to equal socially.

The series has much in common with the later BBC sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, except that the central couple were unmistakably working class while in &quot;Appearances&quot; social climbing was a central element of the programme.

==Episodes==

===Pilot===
The pilot episode, titled &quot;The Bed&quot;, was first broadcast in series three of &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; on 28 December 1963.

Fred and Thora have been using the same bed for 25 years and it is lumpy and past its best. Thora decides it&#x27;s time to get not just a new bed but two separate beds, because Fred keeps taking the bed clothes, etc. However two beds cost much more than one so she settles on a nice bed but that night makes Fred&#x27;s life a nightmare as she tries to get settled, so Fred goes to the spare room to sleep on the old bed. While still nagging him though he&#x27;s now in another room, Thora finds his present and card for their Silver Anniversary tomorrow, costing the £15 she thought he&#x27;d wasted. She grabs the bed clothes and goes to the other room and gets in bed with Fred. Brian Oulton was the bed salesman.

===Series 1===
===Series 2===
===Series 3===
===Series 4===
===Series 5===
* There was also a &quot;Meet the Wife&quot; sketch on BBC&#x27;s Christmas Night with the Stars for 1964.

== Surviving episodes ==

In common with many other British television series of this era, not all episodes have survived. Only 17 episodes exist in the BBC archives as of June 2020. The following are currently thought to exist:

* Pilot
* Series 1: 1-7
* Series 2: 1-2
* Series 4: 1-6
* Series 5: 7

The first and the fourth series both exist in their entirety (as does the original pilot episode) but Series 2 (of which only the first two episodes remain) and Series 5 (of which only one episode exists) remain incomplete with the entire third series still missing from the TV archives as of 2020.

== DVD release ==
A DVD, (consisting of the remaining episodes of the series) was released on 24 October 2016.
Early editions of the set had a mastering fault whereby the episode &quot;Brother Tom&quot; was accidentally excluded.

== In popular culture ==
The series&#x27; title is mentioned in The Beatles&#x27; 1967 song &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning&quot;.

<text>The Newcomers was a late 1960s BBC soap opera which dealt with the subject of a London family, the Coopers, who moved to a housing estate in the fictional country town of Angleton. It was broadcast in bi-weekly half-hour episodes from October 1965 until November 1969. It was initially produced by Verity Lambert.

== Series outline ==
A fictional light industrial manufacturing company called Eden Brothers decides to relocate to the rural location. There are conflicts with the older members of the existing community, as well as some lighter moments as urbanites encounter &quot;country characters&quot;. Many of the relocated workers have trouble living outside the city. As the series progresses, problems on the factory floor spill over into the community. Throughout this the Coopers strive to raise their daughter and two sons, who are having their own issues. The Cooper and Harker families were the initial focus of the series. The on-screen sudden death of the character of Ellis Cooper led to a gradual shift away from the Coopers, who by the end of the serial barely featured.

A change of the managing director of Eden Bros to Andrew Kerr heralded the arrival of his daughter Kirsty, played by Jenny Agutter, but only during her school holidays.

Only five complete editions are known to have survived:

The opening sequences of the first episode showed the Cooper family driving to their new home, this was actually Thaxted in Essex. The cast included several actors who later achieved wider fame, including Alan Browning (later seen in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;), Maggie Fitzgibbon, Judy Geeson, Jenny Agutter and Wendy Richard. In two episodes the group Jimmy Powell and the Five Dimensions were featured and appeared at the pub. (They were billed as &quot;the New Dimensions&quot;). They performed their new Decca 45 &#x27;I Just Can&#x27;t Get Over You&#x27;.

<text>The president of Italy () is the head of state of the Italian Republic. Since 1948, there have been 12 presidents of Italy. 

The official residence of the president is the Quirinal Palace in Rome. Among the Italian presidents, three came from Campania (all from Naples), three from Piedmont, two each from Sardinia (both from Sassari) and from Tuscany, one from Liguria, and one from Sicily. No woman has ever held the office.

== Election ==
The president of the Republic is elected by Parliament in a joint session of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. In addition, the 20 regions of Italy appoint 58 representatives as special electors. Three representatives come from each region, save for the small Aosta Valley which appoints one, so as to guarantee representation for all localities and minorities.

According to the Constitution, the election must be held in the form of secret ballot, with all senators, all deputies and the 58 regional representatives all voting. A two-thirds vote is required to elect on any of the first three rounds of balloting and after that a majority suffices. The election is presided over by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, who calls for the public counting of the votes. The vote is held in the &quot;Palazzo Montecitorio&quot;, home of the Chamber of Deputies, which is expanded and re-configured for the event.

The president assumes office after having taken an oath before Parliament and delivering a presidential address. Presidents are elected to serve a seven-year term. Giorgio Napolitano was the first president to be elected to a second term in 2013, followed by Sergio Mattarella in 2022.

=== Timeline ===
== Substitute of the head of state ==
The Acting President of the Republic () is an office not explicitly provided for in the Italian Constitution, but deriving from the provision contained in the article 86. On various occasions, officials had to intercede in the absence of a head of state (notably in the case of a president&#x27;s resignation or ill health). Only Enrico De Nicola, who was elected to be provisional head of state by the Constitutional Assembly on 28 June 1946, had an official title and took residence in the Quirinal Palace. The others took the powers, but not the title of Head of State. After the adoption of the Italian Constitution in 1948, the president of the Senate is eligible to take the powers of head of state in case of absence of the President of the Republic.

<doc id="162684" wikidata="Q6387284" url="?curid=162684" title="Ken Barlow">
<text>Kenneth &quot;Ken&quot; Barlow is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, played by William Roache. He was created by Tony Warren as one of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;″s original characters and December 2020 marked Ken&#x27;s 60th anniversary onscreen. He debuted in the soap&#x27;s first episode on 9 December 1960. Having appeared in the role continuously since that date, Roache is the longest-serving actor in a televised soap opera, and was honoured at the 2010 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; ceremony for the achievement, having surpassed actor Don Hastings from the American soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, who previously held this title. Roache stated in 2010 that he had no plans to leave the role and would remain in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for as long as the producers would have him. In November 2020, Roache was again presented with the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for the longest-serving TV soap star in the world for his six decades in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

Ken Barlow was introduced as the educated son of a working-class family. In being portrayed as both arrogant, moralistic and a political activist, he differed from the other characters in the soap opera, predominantly working class like himself. The character developed a reputation as a ladies&#x27; man; plots saw Ken using underhanded tactics to boost his prospects in an election, dating numerous women, marrying four times to three women (Valerie Tatlock in 1962, Janet Reid in 1972, Deirdre Hunt in 1981 and again in 2005), fathering four children with three women (Lawrence Cunningham in 1961 from Ken&#x27;s affair with Susan Cunningham – though he never knew about Lawrence until 2010 – twins Susan Barlow and Peter Barlow in 1965 from Ken&#x27;s marriage to Valerie Tatlock, and in 1995 Daniel Osbourne from Ken&#x27;s relationship with Denise Osbourne), as well as later adopting Deirdre&#x27;s daughter Tracy Barlow. Of the many women Ken has been paired with, his relationship with Deirdre has been the most enduring. Ken and Deirdre&#x27;s fictional relationship made newspaper headlines in Britain in 1983, due to Deirdre&#x27;s adultery with Mike Baldwin. The storyline captured both media and viewer interest: 20 million people tuned in to watch Ken&#x27;s discovery of the affair. The storyline led to a feud between Ken and Mike, prominent in both characters&#x27; narratives until Mike&#x27;s screen death in 2006. In March 2017, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; centred a &quot;whodunit&quot; storyline around the character, in which Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant; the storyline was dubbed &quot;Who Attacked Ken?&quot;. On 26 May 2017, Ken&#x27;s attacker was revealed as his son Daniel Osbourne (played by Rob Mallard).

Despite his somewhat antagonistic role in the show&#x27;s early years, Ken developed a reputation among critics for representing an archetypal &quot;boring man&quot;. This is an allegation denied by Roache, who has cited Ken&#x27;s evolution over the years, his chaotic love life and dysfunctional family as evidence to the contrary. Roache has been honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards for his portrayal of Ken. Away from the canonical serial, Ken has been portrayed by James Roache (William Roache&#x27;s son) in the dramatisation &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot;, and by Simon Chadwick in the play &quot;Corrie!&quot;. He has also been spoofed by impressionist Jon Culshaw.

==Storylines==
Ken Barlow was born and raised at 3 Coronation Street, Weatherfield, Lancashire. He is the eldest son born to Frank (Frank Pemberton) and Ida Barlow (Noel Dyson). An intelligent pupil, Ken attends grammar school after passing his eleven plus exam, and in 1957 wins a scholarship at the University of Manchester; he lives with his parents and brother David (Alan Rothwell) in Weatherfield while studying and gains a second class honours degree in History and English. Being educated and politically minded, Ken differs from his family and neighbours. This is a source of friction between Ken and his father Frank, who believes Ken is trying to distance himself from his working-class roots. When Ken writes a scathing newspaper article about his uneducated neighbours in Weatherfield, Frank and the community are outraged. In 1961, Ken&#x27;s mother dies in a motor accident. Ken turns down a teaching post to support his father, but he and Frank continue to clash until Frank leaves in 1964. David and Frank&#x27;s deaths (in 1970 and 1975, respectively) leave Ken as the sole surviving Barlow.

Ken begins teaching, and marries Valerie Tatlock (Anne Reid) in July 1962. Two years later, he has a fling with exotic dancer Pip Mistral (Elaine Stevens), but his marriage survives. Twins Peter (Robert Heanue) and Susan (Katie Heanneau) are born on 15 April 1965. In January 1966, Ken has another affair with reporter Jackie Marsh (Pamela Craig); Valerie leaves when she finds out but is later persuaded to return. Ken continues to stand up for his political beliefs and spends seven days in prison in March 1967, after being arrested for protesting. He is left a single parent following Valerie&#x27;s untimely death; she perishes after being electrocuted in January 1971, and he is left heartbroken. Ken is supported by Valerie&#x27;s uncle Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth), with whom he shares a close relationship, but caring for the twins proves too difficult and they are sent to live with their grandparents in Glasgow.

Ken has numerous flings, including a one-night stand with Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox), but his next serious relationship occurs in 1973, when Ken marries Janet Reid (Judith Barker), in the hope that she will mother his two children. Janet refuses to do this, and in 1974 they separate. Janet flits in and out of Ken&#x27;s life until 1977, when she kills herself by taking an overdose when Ken turns down a reconciliation.

When Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) leaves his wife Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride) in 1978, Ken supports her. In 1981, they marry, with Ken becoming stepfather to Deirdre&#x27;s four-year-old daughter Tracy (Christabel Finch). However, by 1983, Deirdre grows bored with Ken and has an affair with his rival, Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs). Ken and Deirdre&#x27;s marriage suffers; the couple separate in 1990, and eventually divorce following Ken&#x27;s affair with Wendy Crozier (Roberta Kerr), his colleague at the local newspaper, &quot;The Weatherfield Recorder&quot;. Ken takes the separation badly and attempts suicide by overdose, but is prevented from doing so by his friend, Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear).

Ken and Mike, who are the moral opposites of each other, remain enemies; Ken is incensed when his daughter, Susan, falls in love and has a short-lived marriage with Mike. In 1991 Ken and Mike compete for the same woman, Alma Sedgewick (Amanda Barrie). When she is dumped by Mike in favour of Jackie Ingram (Shirin Taylor), she starts seeing Ken. On Christmas Day 1991, Mike lures Alma back into his bed to get back at Ken. Later in 1992, Ken falls for one of his pupil&#x27;s mothers – Maggie Redman (Jill Kerman). The Baldwin/Barlow feud erupts again, as Mike is the father of Maggie&#x27;s son, Mark Redman (Christopher Oakswood). Mike hates the thought of Ken spending Christmas Day with his son, but Ken&#x27;s pride gets the better of him. He cannot handle the situation, and he and Maggie split.

Ken has a relationship with hairdresser Denise Osbourne (Denise Black) in 1994 and fathers her child; their son Daniel (Lewis Harney) is born in 1995. Denise agrees to marry Ken, but is having an affair with her brother-in-law Brian Dunkley (Benny Young) at the same time. She leaves Weatherfield in 1996, leaving Daniel with Ken. It is a short-lived custody as, later that year, Denise returns and snatches Daniel; Ken&#x27;s attempts to reclaim his son fail.

Ken and Deirdre remain close, despite their other relationships. They reunite in 1999, following encouragement from Deidre&#x27;s mother Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones). They eventually remarry on 8 April 2005; although in January 2003 Ken discovers that Deirdre had sex with Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) during Christmas 2001, he forgives her and they remain together. Deirdre supports Ken in October 2002 when he loses his teaching post for assaulting a pupil, Aidan Critchley (Dean Ashton), who has been terrorising him. Marital problems arise in 2006 when, following Mike&#x27;s death from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Ken grows jealous of Deirdre&#x27;s consequent grief; he leaves home and tries to rebuild a relationship with his estranged son Daniel. Daniel&#x27;s mother Denise, now single, gets the wrong idea and attempts to rekindle a romance with Ken; Ken rebuffs her advances and returns to Deirdre. Ken does stray in 2009, after meeting Martha Fraser (Stephanie Beacham); he falls in love with her, and in May, plans to leave with her. He cannot go through with it, and jilts Martha, returning to Deirdre. Eventually, he admits to the infidelity. Although Deirdre is angry, she forgives him as he had forgiven her fling with Dev; however, Deirdre later cheats on Ken again, kissing Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers). Relations are once again strained between Ken and Deirdre. The couple acknowledge their mutual unhappiness with their marriage but remain together.

In late August 2010, Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) discovers an unopened letter addressed to Ken, dating back to the 1960s. The letter is written by Ken&#x27;s first girlfriend, Susan Cunningham (Patricia Shakesby), whom Ken had dated in 1960. Susan has a son named Lawrence (Linus Roache), who turns out to be Ken&#x27;s child. Ken and Lawrence bond, which temporarily threatens Ken&#x27;s relationship with his other son Peter. When Ken discovers that Lawrence is intolerant of the homosexuality of his own son, James (James Roache), Ken severs contact. Realising that he has been unappreciative and neglectful of Peter over the years, he makes an effort to bond, supporting him through his relationship and health problems that follow.

In December 2010, Peter is caught up in the Joinery Bar gas leak explosion, which results in an unforgettable tram crash as the explosion severs the tramline above. Ken is fearful that his son is going to die, and this almost happens when Peter goes into cardiac arrest, after marrying Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) on his hospital bed; However, Peter survives. Ken supports Peter and Leanne as Peter struggles to regain a sense of reality, the explosion having left him paralysed, potentially for life. Meanwhile, James comes to stay with the Barlows for a while, with no-one knowing that his role in a soup kitchen in town is actually part of a scam. When Ken discovers this, James packs his things and leaves; Ken tries to make him stay but James pushes him out of the way, knocking him unconscious. Ken is not seriously hurt, though.

Ken doesn&#x27;t know where his loyalties lie when Peter is found to be having an affair with Carla Connor (Alison King), and he is estranged from his son, Simon (Alex Bain). Ken is then shocked to discover that Peter has been indicted for the murder of Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel), who had been found not guilty of raping Carla. He tries to help but is pushed away. Eventually, it is found that Frank&#x27;s mother Anne was the real culprit. She is given a custodial sentence, whilst Peter is free to go. In mid-2013, Ken leaves the street temporarily to look after his grandson Adam in Canada. (a plot devised due to actor William Roache being on leave after being arrested). He returns in August 2014 to find his family in chaos. Peter has been imprisoned for the murder of his secret lover Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) and Tracy is engaged to Carla&#x27;s brother Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis). Carla had been pregnant with Peter&#x27;s baby but had a miscarriage after they separated and Deirdre has fallen apart at the prospect of dealing with all this on her own. Ken is infuriated that Deirdre did not tell him sooner about all this and sets out to clear Peter&#x27;s name, only to find that the majority of residents on the street, including Simon, believes that Peter did kill Tina. Ken is not sure whom to believe anymore. He later discovers that Peter has sacked his lawyer and it becomes even more likely that he will be found guilty of the murder.

Deirdre goes to stay with her friend, Bev Unwin (Susie Blake), in October 2014, when it becomes clear the stress of the trial is destroying her. Peter is found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. However, the verdict is quickly reversed, when it is discovered that it was actually Rob who murdered Tina. Peter is released from prison but makes the decision to leave the street, as he has hardly anything keeping him around, which hurts Simon. Ken tries to make Peter change his mind, but he is adamant on leaving, so Ken respects his wishes and sees him off. At this point, Deirdre should have come home but called back to say she was staying with Bev a while longer, as one of her relatives had just died. In July 2015, Deirdre dies and Ken is absolutely devastated by this news. Liz announces Deirdre&#x27;s death in The Rovers Return. Deirdre&#x27;s funeral is held the week after. It is revealed that Deirdre would have been home earlier. However, news of Tracy and Tony&#x27;s fling reached her and she was ashamed to come home and face Liz. As a result, Ken feels animosity toward Tracy for seemingly stealing Deirdre&#x27;s last two months from him, when she could have been home when she died.

Ken later begins dating Nessa Warner (Sadie Shimmin), much to the disapproval of Rita and Emily. Tracy is deeply upset and accuses Ken of betraying Deirdre. Ken kicks Tracy out when he discovers that Tracy has seen her ex–fiancée Rob, who&#x27;s in prison for murder. In early 2016, Ken dumps Nessa after finding out Nessa had an affair with her sister Cathy&#x27;s late husband. In October 2016, Ken is shocked to see his son Peter. He accuses Peter of drinking and after their argument, Ken suffers a stroke and he is hospitalised.

In early 2017, Ken&#x27;s son Daniel is offered a place at Oxford University. He decides not to go choosing to support his new girlfriend Sinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn), who fell pregnant. Ken later turns on Sinead saying she has trapped Daniel and blames her for his son not going to university, something that he wishes he had done in 1960. He realized that he had wasted his time being with Deirdre, and wishes that he had not married her, but truly loved her more than his other wives, despite her affair with men like Adam&#x27;s father, Mike in 1983. He mentions to Audrey that he has chosen his adoptive daughter Tracy as his favourite, for her mother&#x27;s true love, over his other children, despite her actions, and wanted to leave her in his will everything. After pushing his family away from him and making Sinead have a secret abortion Ken is pushed down the stairs and left for dead by an unknown assailant. He recovers from his injuries in hospital.

In early 2019, Ken begins a relationship with Audrey&#x27;s frenemy Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska). In 2020, Ken decided to move away from the street for a new adventure and moved into the Stillwaters retirement complex with Claudia. After moving in, they were introduced to Charles Moore, the chairman of the residents&#x27; committee, and Ken also discovered his old friend Norris living at Stillwaters. After missing Eccles (his dog), he sneaks her in, but is caught by Charles who sues him for damages, soon after this incident, Eccles dies of a tumour, Norris informs Ken that he had heard Charles make a comment at Eccles&#x27; expense, making him go up against Charles for election for the head of the residence committee, Ken and Norris did some digging and discovered Charles&#x27;s abuse of power, secretly stealing money from the residents and after exposing this, Ken won the vote, but he handed it over to Norris as he felt unsuited for the environment of Stillwaters. As Ken and Claudia agreed they both wanted different things, Ken left, ending up back at No.1 Coronation Street. After returning, Ken makes sporadic appearances throughout late 2020. He initially announced that he would sell No.1 Coronation Street which led to a bidding war between Tracy and Steve, and Peter and Carla. However, Ken eventually changes his mind.

==Creation and development==

===Casting===

Ken Barlow is one of the twenty-two original &quot;Coronation Street&quot; characters devised by series creator Tony Warren. He made his debut in the soap&#x27;s first episode, broadcast on 9 December 1960. While auditionees for the other twenty-one original roles were drawn from casting director Margaret Morris&#x27; contacts in the north of England, Warren spotted William Roache performing in the Granada Television play &quot;Marking Time&quot;, and knew that he was the right actor to play Ken. He attended the audition, at which he was asked to read &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper in a Lancashire accent. Roache believes that his indifference towards being cast had a positive impact on his audition, as it enabled him to relax. Two pilot episodes were filmed, with Ken played by Roache in one, and by actor Philip Lowrie in the other. Lowrie was later cast in the role of another original character, Dennis Tanner.

Roache was initially offered the role of Ken on a thirteen-episode, six-week contract. His agent convinced him to take it, as it would enhance his exposure around the broadcast of &quot;Marking Time&quot;. &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was a hit with viewers and its contract was extended. Roache was given a six-month contract in early 1961, followed by a one-year contract in June of that year, which he deemed amazing security at a time when he had been &quot;leading a hand-to-mouth existence&quot;. The series became a long-running soap opera, airing multiple times weekly, and Roache continued in the role, though gradually ceased to affect a Lancashire accent. Roache was rumoured to have earned £10 per episode when he started compared to the £3,000 per episode that he earned in 2010. However, Roache himself confirmed this was untrue, citing the actual figure as £70. He stated in 2010 that although he initially only intended to feature in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for a short time, once he had filmed it and it was transmitted with &quot;such colossal impact&quot;, he realised it was something special.

According to writer Daran Little, Roache was partly responsible for the name of the street where the soap is set, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, which also serves as the programme&#x27;s title. The soap was originally titled &quot;Florizel Street&quot; when it was commissioned. Roache reportedly could not pronounce &#x27;Florizel&#x27;, so the name of the street was changed to &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

===Longevity===
By 1984, following the departures of original characters Annie Walker, Albert Tatlock, Len Fairclough and Elsie Tanner, Ken was the only character from the original cast who remained in the soap opera. A potential storyline was devised in which Ken and his then-wife Valerie would move to Australia.

Spiritual enlightenment and a desire for self-improvement led Roache to consider quitting the series in the early 1970s, as he struggled with being in &quot;the most ego-driven profession there is&quot;. He ultimately decided to stay—a decision he is happy with in retrospect, as his qualms were never with the series itself, but the way he felt personally. Roache said in 2010, &quot;When people ask me why I&#x27;ve played the same role for 50 years I try to explain that I haven&#x27;t because like all human beings, and thanks to clever script-writers, Ken&#x27;s evolved. He&#x27;s been married three times, had 24 girlfriends and is head of a totally dysfunctional family. He has a son [Peter] who&#x27;s an alcoholic bigamist and a daughter [Tracy] who&#x27;s a convicted murderer. How many actors get the chance to perform scenes with meaty content like that?&quot;

===Characterisation===
Tony Warren created Ken as a &quot;zeitgeist&quot; of modern times in 1960, and it has been suggested that Ken is a &quot;prism through which to read the political and cultural history of the last half century&quot;. In the soap&#x27;s early years, Ken was frequently presented as resenting what he saw as the anti-intellectual, repressed climate around him, and author Dorothy Hobson has suggested that Ken was ashamed of his working-class roots. Roache concurs that Ken obviously had higher aspirations than &quot;being stuck in Coronation Street&quot;, but notes that &quot;he was also portrayed as a nice young guy who was happy to help out if he could.&quot; Roache considers himself &quot;the guardian of Ken&quot;, responsible for ensuring that his actions and dialogue remain true to the character. This responsibility led to a two-year quarrel with his co-star Pat Phoenix, when she insisted that her character, Elsie Tanner, undermine Ken in an argument. Annoyed at Ken being belittled and the scene stripped of its &quot;dramatic impact&quot;, Roache rowed with Phoenix, who did not speak to him again—outside of their scenes together—for two years.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; Joe Moran likened Ken to Richard Hoggart&#x27;s scholarship boy, &quot;the &#x27;uprooted and anxious&#x27; figure whose education had alienated him from his working-class origins.&quot; Moran suggested that Ken has led &quot;what Hoggart once called a &#x27;carousel life&#x27;, a life not of the upward trajectory of the professional career but of living from year to year and taking whatever job turns up.&quot; Moran added that Ken &quot;refused to go along with the last half century&#x27;s stress on consumer aspiration and meritocratic elitism&quot;, but added that by modern standards, &quot;Ken has wasted his education and his life. He has played little part in &#x27;wealth creation&#x27; [...] and is still stuck in the same house he lived in when he was a student, leading his carousel life, stoically and decently.&quot;

Ken&#x27;s political stance is left-liberal. He has been described as the most famous fictional reader of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a newspaper that attracts readers of the mainstream left of British political opinion. Ken has had several forays into journalism for left-wing publications over the years, and was occasionally shown to be frustrated that his political views were not shared by others. A scathing article he wrote for a newspaper, in which he labelled his neighbours as &quot;lazy-minded, politically ignorant, starved of a real culture and prejudiced against any advance in human insight and scientific progress&quot;, led to clashes with his father and a fistfight at the Rovers with Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson). Although Ken has occasionally espoused socialist ideology, Roache suggests that he is really more of a &quot;liberal, fair-minded guy [...] always looking to right the wrongs of society&quot;, and &quot;a man of integrity who fights for what he thinks is right&quot;.

Author Graeme Kay discussed Ken&#x27;s evolution within the show: &quot;He began as a bit of a prig, in the eyes of working-class father Frank, but matured into a sound family man, only to go astray. He changed from teacher to newspaper owner, through various jobs, but threw that away too. He has always liked to see himself as a big fish in a small pond, with his steely, domineering manner and feeling of superior intellect.&quot; Little suggested that Ken has transformed from an angry young man who never fitted in and was always challenging the system, into a bore next door, eventually discovering that he could not change the world after all. Little dubbed Ken &quot;Coronation Street&quot;″s elder statesman and lynch-pin, a one-man Greek tragedy, and the greatest survivor in Weatherfield.

The character has a reputation amongst critics as boring and a man of morals; Moran dubbed him the archetypal boring man. Chronicling the history of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 2007, Virgin Media stated, &quot;Perhaps unfairly dubbed boring, Ken is ultimately an intelligent man, frustrated by the cards life has dealt him – although the hair, clothes and strong morals haven&#x27;t helped.&quot; Popular perception of Ken as being boring originated, in Roache&#x27;s view, around the time of the Ken–Deirdre–Mike love triangle storyline. He denies the label, particularly given that Ken has had numerous romantic dalliances during his tenure. Karen Price of the &quot;Western Mail&quot; called him the Street&#x27;s resident intellectual, who has never quite managed to break free from his roots.

Ken is renowned for having had multiple relationships with women during his time in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Discussing this, author Hobson has suggested that Ken&#x27;s numerous relationships could give the impression that the character is a lothario or a great romantic; however, Hobson noted that this would be inaccurate as Ken is &quot;neither a great romantic nor someone with whom you would be wise to trust your romantic or emotional future. In fact, he is one of the characters about whom audiences would tend to want to warn any female characters to &#x27;stay away, it&#x27;ll end in tears&#x27;&quot;. Roache feels that Ken&#x27;s approach to romance early in his tenure belied his educated, intellectual affectations, and revealed him to be a typical &quot;northern working-class man at heart.&quot; He explained: &quot;[Ken] was the sort who wanted to have a wife who would stay at home, look after the kids and make sure the house was run smoothly, while he went off to work to pursue a career. It was very old-fashioned in many ways, but he could never see it that way and it was often left to the women he had relationships with to remind him of that trait in his character.&quot;

Ken&#x27;s many relationships have been marred by infidelities. Despite being generally &quot;well-meaning&quot;, Roache assessed that for the first two decades of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, Ken had a ruthless streak where women were involved. While he has since mellowed somewhat, he was initially a &quot;sensitive, thinking chauvinist who liked the idea of having a wife who was always there for him, but at the same time [...] found nothing wrong with flirting or going off with another woman.&quot; ITV publicity referred to the number of relationships and flings he has had, stating &quot;This could take a while ... Ken has had more girlfriends than most of the Street&#x27;s male residents put together.&quot; Between the periods of 1960 and 2007, Ken married four times and dated 27 women, including a character played by the then unknown actress Joanna Lumley, who played headmaster&#x27;s daughter Elaine Perkins in 1973.

====Valerie Tatlock====
Ken&#x27;s first notable relationship in the serial was with the character Valerie Tatlock (Anne Reid) in 1961. Roache and Reid had been to neighbouring schools, which gave them common ground and a relaxed attitude to working together. Roache once attributed their success to his own rapport with Reid, citing it as a helpful element in their on-screen chemistry. Ken and Valerie married on 4 August 1962. Aware that the characters had become popular, executive producer H. V. Kershaw requested that Granada Television&#x27;s evening duty officer be made available on the night of broadcast, in order to take viewers&#x27; congratulatory phone calls. Although no calls were made, 20 million viewers watched the wedding episode. Reid was &quot;thrilled&quot; with the reaction to the wedding. Roache was initially sceptical about the impact marriage would have on Ken&#x27;s development. Roache said: &quot;I was a sort of young semi-heartthrob in those days and thought getting married was going to finish all that.&quot; He felt that, given Ken&#x27;s aspirations of upward social mobility and desire to leave Weatherfield, marriage conflicted with his characterisation, but realised it was necessary for the writers to anchor him in the area.

Valerie gave birth to twins, Peter and Susan, and became a housewife to look after them. All scenes involving the child actors were filmed separately from episodic shoots, to avoid unwanted noise ruining Roache and Reid&#x27;s scenes. In one storyline, Ken had to start looking after the children more frequently, but he grew bored and would often leave them unattended. Valerie accused him of attempted murder on one occasion when a small house fire occurred – with the twins trapped inside. His boredom with his marriage caused him to have an affair with Jackie Marsh (Pamela Craig). There were only &quot;kissing scenes&quot; written into scripts, but the production team made it clear they were having a sexual relationship. The storyline &quot;horrified&quot; viewers, and Craig received abusive letters from angry fans. Craig knew nothing more than a short affair could occur between the pair. On-screen Elsie Tanner convinced him to end the affair; Valerie found out, but forgave him. Roache enjoyed the aftermath, as it added a new dimension to Ken, whereby &quot;He was a married man with kids, and had all of those good intentions, but he was also liable to stray and clearly had trouble resisting the temptation of another woman.&quot;

Ken and Valerie&#x27;s marriage came to an untimely end in 1971. Following Reid&#x27;s decision to leave the role – having grown bored of playing the character – the producers opted to kill Valerie off. Reid and Roache were briefly concerned that her departure would result in Ken being written out, and Roache recalls that Ken emigrating with the twins was a scenario under consideration. To his relief, he was kept on. Valerie died after being electrocuted while trying to mend a faulty hair dryer. After the fatal shock, she knocked over an electric heater, setting the Barlow&#x27;s house on fire. A then-record audience tuned in for Valerie&#x27;s death, scripted by Leslie Duxbury. The following episode ended with Ken walking through the burned remains of their home, in a scene that Roache has deemed one of his &quot;most enjoyable and satisfying moments in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.&quot;

====Janet Reid====

Ken&#x27;s second marriage in the serial was to a character named Janet Reid (Judith Barker) in 1973; their relationship was short-lived. There was no buildup to their marriage; Ken returned from Scotland and introduced Janet as his wife. The storyline&#x27;s fast pace angered Roache; he once stressed: &quot;I was very cross about the whole thing. There was no wedding, she just arrived, no build-up to it. It was just like an idea that was shoved in. I wasn&#x27;t happy.&quot; The storyline was unpopular with viewers, who did not approve of the wedding. Janet was already an unpopular character by then, because of her previous affairs with two other &quot;Coronation Street&quot; males. Barker said Janet was often perceived as treating Ken unfairly. She openly showed her dislike for his children and sent them to boarding school. The situation saw Ken realise he was in a &quot;loveless marriage&quot; – a match made whilst feeling lonely and under the presumption that she was his last chance of happiness. The breakdown of their marriage was accompanied by what Little dubbed &quot;a series of spectacular rows&quot;, which saw Ken become violent towards Janet. One such row, which followed Ken&#x27;s discovery of Janet&#x27;s plans to send the twins to boarding school, was later used as an exercise in drama schools, which Roache deemed &quot;a nice compliment to everyone involved in creating the moment.&quot;

Janet and Ken split up in 1974. Barker was included in the series on and off for a few years, as Janet would occasionally return to be with Ken. In late 1976, Barker was asked to reprise the role for a final time. Janet returned on-screen in 1977 and asked Ken for another chance, claiming she had changed. When he rejects her, she commits suicide by taking an overdose. Barker recalled the &quot;exhausting&quot; scenes she and Roache filmed, and said there was substantial &quot;dramatic tracking&quot; scenes as Ken discovered her dead in bed. Ken was described as &quot;shattered&quot; and &quot;remorseful&quot; by the death of Janet, and felt guilty over the fact he did not try to help her more. To worsen his situation, he was initially suspected of murdering her.

====Deirdre Hunt====
In 1972, Deirdre Hunt, played by Anne Kirkbride, was introduced into &quot;Coronation Street&quot;; the character would become synonymous with Ken&#x27;s narrative when, in the early 1980s, Deirdre became Ken&#x27;s third wife. A combined audience of 24 million viewers tuned in to see the nuptials.

Roache inferred that the writers no longer knew how to utilise Ken. Although he had rarely done so in the past, he voiced his concerns to the series&#x27; producer, dismayed that the character &quot;seemed to be floating in a nebulous state&quot;. He believes that Ken was thereafter included in &quot;much stronger stuff&quot; as a result, including a storyline in which Deirdre had an affair with his rival, Mike Baldwin (Briggs). The storyline was devised in 1982. Then producer Mervyn Watson recalls: &quot;It was normal story conference and we looked at the Ken/Deirdre marriage and had the idea of her having an affair with somebody in the Street. It was extremely passionately debated because there were categorical and opposite view points expressed.&quot; Watson believes that actors often feel &quot;disturbed and uncomfortable&quot; at the prospect of what their character will experience. In turn, he thought the scenario generated some of the best performances in the actors&#x27; careers. He concluded that Roache proved his theory correct, and praised his performance.

A now infamous scene, in which Ken comes face-to-face with Mike following the discovery of the affair and a showdown ensues, was originally scripted differently. Roache disliked this version, as he believed Ken&#x27;s response lacked realism. Partly fuelled by his previous frustration with Ken&#x27;s &quot;lame&quot; characterisation, Roache approached the episode&#x27;s director, Brian Mills, and requested that Ken be allowed to hit Mike. Though the filming set-up planned for the scene did not allow for this, it was agreed that Ken would attempt to hit Mike, and that Deirdre would intervene.

Roache recalls viewers taking it very seriously, to the point that he received letters reading: &quot;Dear Ken, I though you should know that Mike Baldwin is seeing your wife!&quot; 20 million viewers tuned in for the episode; it attained the soap&#x27;s second-highest recorded overnight ratings, surpassed only by the farewell episode of Hilda Ogden (played by Jean Alexander) in 1987.

Ken and Deidre have been described as soap opera&#x27;s version of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Their relationship featured various affairs, break-ups and reunions over the years. The couple&#x27;s first marriage eventually disintegrated in the early 1990s, this time when Ken had an affair with colleague Wendy Crozier, a dalliance which ended in divorce for the Barlows. Ken was kicked out of home on New Year&#x27;s Day 1990. Their on/off relationship continued, with each having various other liaisons, until producers decided to reunite Ken and Deidre in 1999. Ken and Deirdre&#x27;s second marriage in 2005 was watched by an estimated 13 million viewers, compared to the nine million who watched the wedding of Prince Charles to Camilla Parker Bowles the following day. Coincidentally, Ken and Deirdre&#x27;s first wedding in 1981 was screened within 48 hours of Prince Charles and Princess Diana&#x27;s wedding, and just as in 2005, the Barlow wedding attracted more viewers than the royal wedding.

During Anne Kirkbride&#x27;s lifetime, Roache was complimentary about Ken and Deirdre, as well as about Kirkbride—whom, he stated, he loved as much as Ken loved Deirdre—with this love explaining why Ken always ended up returning to her. Speaking in 2010, Roache said: &quot;We have been together on screen for pretty much 30 years now and so much of what we do on camera is instinctive. We really are like an old married couple who have had their ups and downs, lived through them and come out the other side.&quot;

====Denise Osbourne====
Ken was paired romantically with hairdresser Denise Osbourne (Denise Black) in 1994, the romance scuppering the chances of a reconciliation between recent divorcees Ken and Deirdre. Scriptwriters had actually been planning to reunite Ken and Deirdre, but when Kirkbride fell ill and had to be written out, the scripts were changed and Ken was paired with Denise instead. Black has suggested that the romance came out of nowhere.

&quot;The Official Coronation Street Annual 1997&quot; has described Ken and Denise as a &quot;mis-matched pair&quot; who were never destined to spend their lives together. In the storyline, Ken fathered Denise&#x27;s son Daniel. They had an on/off relationship and a wedding was planned in 1996; however, in a plot twist, it was revealed to Ken that Denise, unable to &quot;hold her primitive lusts in check&quot;, was having an affair with her brother-in-law, Brian. Upon the discovery, Ken&#x27;s happiness was snatched away in what has been described by &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; as &quot;harrowing circumstances&quot;, and one of the character&#x27;s worst moments. Denise Black has discussed her character&#x27;s ambivalence towards her relationship with Ken, revealing why she believed Denise engaged in infidelity: &quot;The thing is that she&#x27;s in love with both men. When she&#x27;s with Brian she loves him. And she&#x27;s completely in love with Ken when he&#x27;s with her. So she has two loves and all the guilt that goes along with that scenario. Denise doesn&#x27;t mean to cause so much pain. Her problem is that she just doesn&#x27;t know whether she&#x27;s coming or going.&quot; When Ken discovered the truth the wedding was called off, with Ken telling Denise to &quot;get out before I kill you&quot;.

Following the revelation and amidst the fallout, Denise absconded, leaving her son in Ken&#x27;s custody. This facilitated Black&#x27;s desire to have a six-month break from the serial. The character returned in the winter of 1996, for the last part of her storyline, Black having decided to quit the role. Denise&#x27;s return storyline was scripted to coincide with &quot;Coronation Street&quot;″s increase to four weekly episodes. It focused upon a custody battle for Daniel between Ken and Denise after Denise snatched Daniel. A source at the time discussed the storyline and Ken&#x27;s reaction to losing his son: &quot;Ken is devastated when he returns home the week before Christmas and finds his son gone. He simply can&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s been snatched by the woman who dumped them. He immediately starts a custody battle. Denise plays heavily on the fact that she is the mother, while Ken [claims] that he is back in a relationship with his ex-wife Deirdre. Deirdre actually goes to court with him for support, but she gets angry when she finds out he tries to use their friendship as a lever to get Daniel back.&quot; When Denise was awarded custody, she left &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and Ken lost contact with his son.

Denise was reintroduced for several months in 2007, over a decade after she had last appeared. Ken tracked down his son following marital unease with Deirdre, which led to interactions with Denise when he turned up unannounced for a visit. Black was pleased to be invited back, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think that you can have Ken Barlow&#x27;s baby and forget about it, can you?&quot; Denise&#x27;s return was used as a catalyst to cause further problems in Ken and Deirdre&#x27;s marriage, Ken having grown discontented. It was only a brief return; once Denise&#x27;s advances towards Ken were rejected, Denise was written out again. Denise briefly returned in 2017 as part of Who Attacked Ken?, for her son Daniel was the attacker.

====Martha Fraser====
In January 2009, Martha Fraser (played by Stephanie Beacham), a new love interest for Ken, was introduced to the show. Ken meets Martha by the canal while he is walking his dog, Eccles. Martha reveals that she is a theatre actress who travels to performances on her barge. Ken seeks her out again, and he helps her go through her lines. Roache told &quot;What&#x27;s on TV&quot; that Ken is happy to find a &quot;like-minded person&quot; who is easy to talk to. He enjoys telling Martha about his problems, his son and his grandchildren, as she is not judgmental. When asked if Ken mentions Deirdre, Roache said &quot;Er... no. Martha asks him about Peter&#x27;s mum and Ken tells her that she&#x27;s dead, which is the truth, so Martha automatically assumes he&#x27;s a widower and he doesn&#x27;t put her right.&quot; Ken also chooses not to mention Martha to Deirdre; Roache believed that she would be angry if she found out. Roache revealed that Ken is not thinking about having an affair with Martha, but he is &quot;captivated&quot; by her, and does have feelings for her. During the storyline, Roache&#x27;s wife, Sara, died. Roache was given compassionate leave from the soap, and writers were forced to rework Ken&#x27;s storyline. Ken and Martha eventually consummate their relationship, and Ken considers leaving Deirdre and Weatherfield. He changes his mind at the last minute, and Martha leaves, alone.

Alison Graham of &quot;Radio Times&quot; said Martha was Ken&#x27;s soulmate, because &quot;she&#x27;s the most perfectly bourgeois bit-on-the-side.&quot; Graham said that Martha allowed Ken&#x27;s &quot;middle-class heart&quot; to sing after the pair bonded over a love of BBC Radio 4, books and plays. Comparing Ken&#x27;s relationships with Martha and Deirdre to a prison sentence, Graham said Martha offered Ken a deserving parole from the &quot;years of breaking rocks in the prison yard of his marriage to Deirdre.&quot; She hoped that Ken and Martha were &quot;soon in the throes of ecstasy&quot;, because Ken deserved it. Following the conclusion to Ken&#x27;s relationship with Martha, Roache expressed an interest in having more girlfriends for Ken introduced in the future. The actor said, &quot;I thought it was great last year having a girlfriend, especially at my age. A few more would be great. I&#x27;ve lost count of romances I&#x27;ve had in the show, not to mention the four weddings.&quot; Ken and Martha&#x27;s romance was later depicted in the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; musical, &quot;Corrie!&quot;. Ben East of &quot;The Stage&quot; said the romance was &quot;genuinely funny&quot;.

====Other relationships====
Ken&#x27;s first on-screen relationship was with Susan Cunningham (Shakesby), whom he dated throughout the first ten episodes. Ashamed of his family and background, Ken was constantly apologising to her. This frustrated Susan, who actually liked Coronation Street. Fifty years later, it transpired that their relationship had left Susan pregnant, resulting in the birth of a son, Lawrence. After Susan, Ken&#x27;s early love interests included Marian Lund (Patricia Heneghan), a librarian eleven years his senior; Yvonne Chappell (Alex Marshall), a hotel receptionist he met en route to first wife Valerie&#x27;s funeral; Norma Ford (Diana Davies), an impressionable young shop-assistant; Wendy Nightingale (Susan Tebbs), a married woman who moved in with Ken, making them &quot;Coronation Street&quot;″s first unmarried cohabiting couple; and Elaine. Roache believes that Ken was in love with Elaine, though her feelings for him were less intense. He recalls some discussion of re-introducing her to the series in 2009; however, this did not come to fruition. Upon separating from Elaine, Ken confided in his friend Rita (Knox) that, &quot;There were other fellers more glamorous, more successful, more wealthy and more interesting than me.&quot; According to Roache, the line offers insight into Ken&#x27;s psyche, evidencing that he truly belongs on Coronation Street, despite his desires to the contrary.

Although the number of romances Ken was involved in declined from the 1980s onwards, Roache states that those relationships he did have &quot;tended to be bigger and more involved&quot;. His later love interests included Wendy Crozier (Kerr), Alma Sedgewick (Barrie) and Maggie Redman (Kerman).

===Family===
Ken was disdainful of his parents, Frank (Pemberton) and Ida (Dyson). Their strained familial relationship was apparent from his very first scene, in which conflict arose over his reluctance to eat a meal with brown sauce. Roache called it &quot;good character-defining stuff&quot;, which established the antagonism between Ken and his father, borne from Ken&#x27;s snobbery and desire to abandon his roots. The death of his mother further illuminated the father-son relationship. Roache recalls that, &quot;although their relationship could often be stormy, with Ken&#x27;s views and attitude rubbing Frank up the wrong way on a number of issues, the fact was that they had been thrown together by her death and they had to get used to living with each other without the buffer that Ida had often provided.&quot; While Dyson left the series under her own volition, Pemberton later became one of several cast members fired under Aspinall&#x27;s tenure as producer. By 1984, both of Ken&#x27;s parents had left the Street. Ken was originally intended to have a sister named Enid. Warren decided against her inclusion, and instead created a younger brother, professional footballer David (Rothwell), to enable the show to represent teenage males. Rothwell feels that an &quot;underlying antagonism&quot; existed between Ken and David, which stemmed from the fact Ken had the advantage of a university education, while his brother did not.

Ken was bored with looking after the children, Peter and Susan, before Valerie&#x27;s death. Afterwards, further problems occurred and Ken was no longer able to cope. The writers were initially uncertain whether to continue with Ken as a single father, or dispatch the children and pursue a less-encumbered lifestyle. Roache said, &quot;Ken tried to bring up the kids on his own, but he wasn&#x27;t doing so good. So he sent them up to Glasgow to live with his mother-in-law.&quot; Ken still remained in contact; Roache recalled Ken often saying: &quot;Right, I&#x27;m off to Scotland.&#x27;&quot; Roache has suggested that the subsequent problems in his children&#x27;s adulthood were Ken&#x27;s fault: &quot;I blame Ken for how they&#x27;ve all turned out. He shoved his kids up in Scotland, didn&#x27;t really look after them. But you don&#x27;t want a happy family in the Street. You want a wonderful dysfunctional one like the one I&#x27;ve got, they&#x27;re great and Deirdre is wonderful.&quot; The animosity between Ken and his children has been explored throughout the programme&#x27;s duration. Chris Gascoyne, who took on the role of Peter in the 2000s, has suggested that there is a lot of tension between Ken and Peter due to the dysfunctional nature of the Barlow family. Guilt over the twins&#x27; upbringing led Ken to dote on his youngest son, Daniel, as he was keen to avoid repeating his past mistakes. Their close relationship resulted in Roache challenging the series producers when a script required Ken to allow Daniel to be taken away by his mother. The actor felt that Ken would not accept this; he would fight. The scriptwriters apologised, but it was too late to re-write the plot.

After Valerie&#x27;s death, Ken became responsible for looking after her uncle, Albert, and he later became known as Ken&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Albert&quot;. Albert would often make attempts to interfere in Ken&#x27;s life, as he had no one else. At one stage, Ken was making plans to leave Weatherfield. When Albert revealed he could not pay his bills on his pension, Ken opted to stay. The storyline has been called a turning point for Ken—when he realised he belonged in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and had to help the community and Albert alike. Ken moved in with him and Albert gradually saw Ken as &quot;the son he never had&quot;. Roache enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with Howarth, whom he first met as a schoolboy. He characterised Ken and Albert&#x27;s relationship as &quot;often a little bumpy and uncomfortable, but underlying all of that was an affection the two had for each other.&quot;

Ken had a largely antagonistic relationship with his &quot;acid-tongued&quot; mother-in-law Blanche, Deirdre&#x27;s mother, who has been described as a &quot;thorn in Ken&#x27;s side&quot;. She would criticise his looks, and on one occasion she accused him of being homosexual. When Ken&#x27;s affair with Martha was exposed, Blanche took her comments too far: she tormented Deirdre for staying with him, which resulted in her being thrown out of the Barlow household and forced to live with Peter. However, she was seen as &quot;the glue&quot; of the Barlow family in the modern era, holding them together. Blanche was willing to put her wit aside and fight to ensure that Ken and Deirdre stayed together, although most of the time, she interfered in his life. Even in death, Blanche managed to make a final remark aimed at Ken, through her will. The storyline was described as giving her the chance to have &quot;the last laugh&quot;.

In 2010, it was announced that Roache&#x27;s own children, Linus and James, would be joining the cast. They played his long-lost son and grandson, respectively. In the storyline, Ken finds a letter which discloses he had a secret son with a short-term girlfriend. Roache said he looked forward &quot;immensely&quot; to working with his children during the fiftieth-anniversary year. The reunion was short-lived due to a rift between Lawrence and James. Lawrence was a bigot who could not accept that the fact James was homosexual. The producers decided to run the storyline to highlight the fact homophobia still exists. Gay rights activists approved of the storyline because the producers showed both sides of the issue. On-screen, Ken was opposed to Lawrence&#x27;s views and decided to embrace James&#x27; sexuality. He urged him to be true to himself and ignore his father&#x27;s bigoted views. Lawrence does not agree with Ken&#x27;s liberal stance. In 2011, James returned to stay with Ken. Ken was grateful for the chance to get to know him better. Ken sees James as his &quot;intellectual match&quot;, and has a lot of respect for him because he is a &quot;well-educated, erudite young man&quot;. He became carried away and moved him in because Ken has always &quot;longed for intelligent conversation&quot;.

===Feud with Mike Baldwin===
Television researcher Helena Robson has discussed the appeal of soap operas, and suggests that &quot;many soap stories are never finally resolved and conflicts between characters may run throughout the programme&#x27;s history&quot;. She uses the &quot;undying hatred&quot; between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) as an example of this, suggesting that viewers &quot;welcome the sense of stability this offers although the element of change offers as much enjoyment for viewers.&quot; It was suggested in an ITV documentary in 2006 that Ken and Mike&#x27;s hatred was a clash of cultures: &quot;Barlow the lefty do-gooder versus Baldwin, the cut-and-thrust money grabber.&quot; Briggs has claimed that Ken was envious of Mike because he was rich and successful while Ken was not, and Roache has claimed that the reason Ken disliked Mike was because he was a self-centred and self-made individual.
Ken&#x27;s feud with Mike—spanning over 20 years—began in 1983, when Ken discovered that his wife, Deirdre, was having an affair with Baldwin. His dislike for Mike pre-dated the affair, however, and Roache has stated:

Of the love triangle storyline, Briggs has said, &quot;the way it captured the nation was amazing. Everyone was talking about it and the pubs were empty. Men were shouting out: &#x27;Go on Mike, give her one.&#x27; People were disappointed when she went back to Ken&quot;. The storyline had significant cultural impact, with the press claiming that the country was divided between those who thought Deirdre should remain with Ken, and those who thought she should leave with Mike. In her 2003 book, Hobson suggested that Ken &quot;spent at least nineteen years unable to cope with the sense of rejection and betrayal&quot; caused by Mike and Deirdre&#x27;s affair.

Scriptwriters capitalised on the rivalry between the characters when, in 1986, Mike married Ken&#x27;s daughter Susan, a union that Ken strongly opposed. Numerous fights between Ken and Mike were featured, and Briggs has suggested that they became famous for their brawls. The first fight between the pair occurred in 1986, when Ken confronted Mike in his factory about Mike&#x27;s maltreatment of his daughter. Of the confrontation, Briggs has said, &quot;It was a classic – Baldwin getting it in his own territory, the factory. It took a lot to get Ken angry but after the way Mike had treated his daughter, he was furious. He marched into the office and let him have it. This was one of those rare times he caught Mike off-guard.&quot; Mike was shown to get revenge on Ken, though it took a further four years before he could do so on-screen. In a scene which aired in 1990, Mike punched Ken, knocking him over a table in the Rovers Return public house. Briggs has suggested that he and Roache became old hands at doing on-screen fistfights, and that both really enjoyed doing the stunts. According to Briggs, no choreographers were ever used. In 1998, one incident left Briggs with an injury after he fell backwards.

Ken and Mike were forced to work together in 2000, when they were featured in a storyline dubbed the &quot;Freshco siege&quot;. Ken and Mike were among several series regulars held up at gunpoint in the soap&#x27;s local supermarket, where Ken had been working as a trolley pusher. The episode was broadcast after the 9 pm watershed due to its depiction of violence. Ken and Mike were bound together by armed robbers, which facilitated an end to their feud; Ken helped Mike to combat a panic attack. The pair resolved to put the past behind them; it was a temporary reprieve. Mike had unknowingly fathered a son, Adam, during his brief marriage to Susan Barlow; she kept the baby a secret from him. Mike discovered Adam&#x27;s existence in 2001; Susan attempted to flee, but was killed in a motor accident. Then followed a battle between Mike and Ken for custody of Adam, with Ken adamant that Mike should not look after his grandson. The storyline led to the fifth fistfight between Ken and Mike in the soap&#x27;s history, with the pair brawling at the funeral of Susan.

The feud came to an end on-screen in 2006, when Briggs quit the role of Mike. Mike was killed off, dying of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; he died in Ken&#x27;s arms. In the final scenes, a disorientated and dying Mike was found wandering the streets by Ken, and as Ken cradled Mike in his arms, the rivals talked about old times before Mike died, signifying the end of their 20-year feud. To promote Mike&#x27;s final scenes, &quot;Radio Times&quot; released a series of photographs with Ken and Mike re-enacting Arthur Devis&#x27;s (1807) painting of the death of Horatio Nelson—Baldwin was shown surrounded by his nearest and dearest during his final moments, with Ken prominently positioned next to him, taking on the role of Captain Hardy, Nelson&#x27;s trusted colleague to whom Nelson famously uttered &quot;Kiss me&quot; before he died. Producer Maire Tracey said, &quot;The fact that Mike dies in Ken&#x27;s arms says it all. For most of Mike&#x27;s life, it was his battles with Ken that kept him going. Like two cowboys, they spent their lives sizing each other up. Behind the scenes Bill Roache has even suggested to Johnny Briggs that they should make a version of &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; for the two elderly cowboys. Both Ken and Mike will miss the bust-ups.&quot;

Reflecting on the feud in 2006, Roache gave reasons why he thinks Ken and Mike clashed so often: &quot;Ken felt threatened when Mike arrived on the street, but it made the part more exciting for Bill. Ken is a nice guy, a loyal guy, a reliable guy. But he isn&#x27;t terribly exciting. So the exciting guy [Mike] comes along and he&#x27;s a bit flash, isn&#x27;t he? But I&#x27;ve always liked the physical side of acting, so my punch-ups with Johnny were probably the best bits. I shall miss those terribly.&quot;

===Who Attacked Ken?===
In March 2017, Ken was at the centre of a &quot;whodunit&quot; storyline which saw an unknown assailant push him down the stairs of his house after striking him over the head with a blunt object. The suspect list was initially narrowed down to six: Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson), Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard), Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre) and Sinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn). However, other suspects such as Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney), Simon Barlow (Alex Bain), Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis) and Chloe Tipton (Jo-Anne Knowles) were later added into the frame. That May, it was revealed Daniel was the attacker.

In September 2010, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, BBC Four aired a drama film titled &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot;, which depicted Tony Warren&#x27;s struggle to get his soap opera commissioned, and the filming of its pilot. Roache himself (as well as playing the character Ken Barlow) appeared in the film and was portrayed by Roache&#x27;s son, James.

In 2011, ITV filmed a spin-off, web-based series featuring Ken and Deirdre, entitled &quot;Ken and Deirdre&#x27;s Bedtime Stories&quot;. Created by &quot;Coronation Street&quot; writer Jonathan Harvey, the webisodes featured Ken and Deirdre mulling over the events of their day while in bed.

In 2010, a comedy play about &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was produced; titled &quot;Corrie!&quot;, it was penned by scriptwriter Jonathan Harvey. Ken Barlow was played by Simon Chadwick in the production. Harvey has suggested that when he researched the play, in the top five storylines for each of the 50 years of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, three characters regularly featured—Ken, Deirdre and Gail Platt. Harvey therefore tried to shape the play around their journeys over the years.

In February 2011, Ken was among various &quot;Coronation Street&quot; characters to have his portrait auctioned for charity in the exhibition &#x27;Behind the Street&#x27; at Manchester&#x27;s Generation Pop Gallery. The black-and-white shots were taken by photographer Rob Evans, and raised £8,600 for charity. The highest bid on a photograph was for a shot of Ken, standing amongst rubble after the Weatherfield tram crash in 2010, a storyline marking the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. In 2010 ITV began selling &quot;Coronation Street&quot; merchandise featuring Ken, including gift wrap and novelty congratulations cards.

A parody song written about the character, entitled &quot;Ken!&quot;, was included on Harry Hill&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Funny Times&quot;. The track features vocals from Hill and Roache. Ken has been spoofed by Jon Culshaw in &quot;The Impressions Show&quot;, where he is having a secret affair with Pat Evans from &quot;EastEnders&quot;, spoofed by Debra Stephenson. Culshaw wanted to include his impression of Ken in the show, saying &quot;We were just looking for an excuse to get him in&quot;, so he decided that Ken and Pat would have a &quot;secret romantic tryst at a motorway service station&quot; somewhere between Weatherfield and the &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ setting of Walford.

In May 2012, Trisha Ward&#x27;s stage musical, &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, debuted. The production, which is based on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, featured Roache playing his on-screen alias, Ken, in a pre-recorded segment. Roache was one of several actors from the television series to feature in the musical. Others included Julie Goodyear, Kevin Kennedy and Brian Capron (who played Bet Gilroy, Curly Watts and Richard Hillman respectively).

==Reception==
For his portrayal of Ken, Roache won the Lifetime Achievement award at The British Soap Awards 1999. In November 2010, Ken surpassed Bob Hughes (Don Hastings) from US soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; to become the longest-serving soap opera actor. Roache was honoured at a &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; ceremony in New York. In 1983, Roache, Kirkbride and Briggs were named TV Personalities of the Year at the Pye Colour Television Awards, for their performances in the Ken–Deirdre–Mike love triangle storyline. Journalist Brian Viner of &quot;The Independent&quot; has suggested that Roache has not been given the accolades he has deserved as a performer because of his longevity in the role of Ken. He felt that it may be a common assumption that Roache is merely playing himself on-screen; this notion diminishes a &quot;rather remarkable acting performance&quot;. He added, &quot;although the bouquets tend to go to actors who repeatedly display their versatility, it is in many ways even harder to inhabit one role for five decades. That said, for sheer staying power Ken and Bill are clearly indivisible: one has lived in the same street practically all his life, the other in the same role [...]. That we have been able to watch the evolution of that young man into the Ken Barlow we know today, no less self-righteous but with 50 years of experiences behind him, is frankly one of the wonders of British television.&quot;

Ken has a reputation for being boring. The British band Half Man Half Biscuit highlighted this point in their 2001 song &quot;Lark Descending&quot;, comparing him unfavourably with a member of the US underground music scene, with the lyric: &quot;I could have been like Lou Barlow, but I&#x27;m more like Ken Barlow&quot;. Despite Ken being fictional, critic Jim Shelley, writing for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 2009, labelled Ken &quot;the most boring man you could ever meet&quot;. Roache sued for libel in 1990 when &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper ran an article branding Ken boring and making allegations that Roache was disliked among the cast of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Roache said to the jury at the court case, &quot;I felt extremely distressed. I could not believe those words had been written, that they had raked into my past. I broke out in a sweat. [...] They were saying that I was not doing my job, that I was a joke to the storyline writers, which is not true&quot;. Roache added in regard to Ken, &quot;If people find someone who has had 23 girlfriends and three wives boring, that&#x27;s fine by me.&quot; Roache won the case and was awarded £50,000; however, he was forced to pay legal costs, which bankrupted him. Brian Viner has suggested that it is remarkable that Ken has been labelled boring in spite of the many plots he has been involved with over the years. Brian Viner said, &quot;It is easy enough to see, despite the extraordinary number of broken relationships and personal crises in his wake, why Ken tends not to make the pulse race when he opens his mouth. After all, he usually opens it only to drink halves of bitter, or to say something sensible or worthy. For 50 years he has been the nearest thing Weatherfield, the fictional area of Greater Manchester where Coronation Street is located, has had to a social conscience.&quot;

In a Channel 4 televised poll that was broadcast in 2001, Ken Barlow was voted the third most-hated TV character of all time, coming behind Phil Mitchell from &quot;EastEnders&quot; and Mr Blobby. In a &quot;Radio Times&quot; poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 15% chose Ken as the soap character they would most like to see retired. He came second in the poll, behind &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ Den Watts (17%).

Television personality Paul O&#x27;Grady wrote the foreword to Roache&#x27;s 2010 autobiography, &quot;50 Years on the Street&quot;. In it, he hailed Ken as &quot;one of the iconic British soap characters&quot;, an all-time great who has been integral to &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. In 2005, Grace Dent of &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested that &quot;Coronation Street&quot; archetypes have influenced latter soap opera characters. On Ken, she stated: &quot;another heavily plagiarised &quot;Corrie&quot; stalwart is Ken Barlow, who as &#x27;resident intellectual&#x27; has been looking down his nose at the proletariat since 1960. Just like poor hangdog-faced Ken, brainy people in soapland (Dr Truman [from &quot;EastEnders&quot;], Roy Cropper, Todd Grimshaw [both from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;], &quot;Emmerdale&quot;″s Ethan the curate) are always miserable and brooding, due to the terrible burden of their mighty intellect in the face of so many simpletons. It rarely pays to be too clever or too rich in soapland as the majority of plotlines rely upon tragic Shakespearian falls from grace which everyone laughs their socks off at.&quot;

In 2009, viewers complained to ITV as well as the media regulator Ofcom after &quot;Coronation Street&quot; broadcast scenes in which Ken made derogatory comments about Christianity. A spokesperson for the show defended the opinions expressed by Ken in the scripts, saying, &quot;&quot;Coronation Street&quot; is a soap opera set in modern society and therefore represents views from all side of the religious spectrum&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist Nancy Banks-Smith spoke highly of Ken&#x27;s affair with Martha Fraser in 2009, calling it &quot;a muted ingenious storyline&quot;. Gareth McLean of &quot;Radio Times&quot; was critical of the storyline: &quot;When it comes to self-delusion, Ken takes the biscuit, claims the cake and wolfs down the éclair. Nursing the notion that he&#x27;s been thwarted by life, he decides to leave Deirdre to sail off into the sunset – or possibly Runcorn – with Martha. All these years and Ken still doesn&#x27;t realise it&#x27;s not Deirdre who&#x27;s the dead weight in his life, it&#x27;s he himself.&quot; The BBC has said of him: &quot;During his record-breaking time on the hit soap, Roache&#x27;s character has led a life full of incident&quot;. Holy Soap suggested that Ken being labelled a gigolo in the local newspaper after his client, Babs, died halfway through eating her meal, was his most memorable moment. In her book &quot;Soap Opera&quot;, Hobson said Ken and his brother David initially represented the younger males of society. She noted that although Ken had many relationships, &quot;he could hardly be described as an early &#x27;Dirty Den&#x27;&quot;, a character notable for his womanising in the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

<doc id="162688" wikidata="Q48279" url="?curid=162688" title="Third gender">
<text>Third gender is a concept in which individuals are categorized, either by themselves or by society, as neither a man nor a woman. It is also a social category present in societies that recognize three or more genders. The term &quot;third&quot; is usually understood to mean &quot;other&quot;, though some anthropologists and sociologists have described fourth and fifth genders.

The state of personally identifying as, or being identified by society as, a man, a woman, or other is usually also defined by the individual&#x27;s gender identity and gender role in the particular culture in which they live.

Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women). In cultures with a third or fourth gender, these genders may represent very different things. To Native Hawaiians and Tahitians, is an intermediate state between man and woman known as &quot;gender liminality&quot;. Some traditional Diné Native Americans of the Southwestern United States acknowledge a spectrum of four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, and masculine man. The term &quot;third gender&quot; has also been used to describe the hijras of South Asia who have gained legal identity, fa&#x27;afafine of Polynesia, and Balkan sworn virgins. A culture recognizing a third gender does not in itself mean that they were valued by that culture and often is the result of explicit devaluation of women in that culture.

While found in a number of non-Western cultures, concepts of &quot;third&quot;, &quot;fourth&quot;, and &quot;fifth&quot; gender roles are still somewhat new to mainstream Western culture and conceptual thought. While mainstream Western scholars—notably anthropologists who have tried to write about the South Asian &quot;hijras&quot; or the Native American &quot;gender variant&quot; and &quot;two-spirit&quot; people—have often sought to understand the term &quot;third gender&quot; solely in the language of the modern LGBT community, other scholars—especially Indigenous scholars—stress that mainstream scholars&#x27; lack of cultural understanding and context has led to widespread misrepresentation of the people these scholars place in the third gender category, as well as misrepresentations of the cultures in question, including whether or not this concept actually applies to these cultures at all.

==Sex and gender==
Since at least the 1970s, anthropologists have described gender categories in some cultures which they could not adequately explain using a two-gender framework. At the same time, feminists began to draw a distinction between sex and (social/psychological) gender.

Anthropologist Michael G. Peletz believes our notions of different types of genders (including the attitudes toward the third gender) deeply affect our lives and reflect our values in society. In Peletz&#x27; book, &quot;Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia&quot;, he describes:
=== Transgender people and third gender ===
Gender may be recognized and organized differently in different cultures. In some non-Western cultures, gender may not be seen as binary, or people may be seen as being able to cross freely between male and female, or to exist in a state that is in-between, or neither. In some cultures, being third gender may be associated with the gift of being able to mediate between the world of the spirits and the world of humans. For cultures with these spiritual beliefs, it is generally seen as a positive thing, though some third gender people have also been accused of witchcraft and persecuted. In most western cultures, people who did not conform to heteronormative ideals were often seen as sick, disordered, or insufficiently formed. However, as of 2013, individuals who live in countries where the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is used, being labeled as disordered for being transgender would no longer occur due to the manual&#x27;s update. Instead, a new diagnosis was announced called gender dysphoria. This new diagnosis highlights the distress a transgender person may experience rather than labels individuals who identify with a third gender as sick or disordered.

The Indigenous of Hawaii are seen as embodying an intermediate state between man and woman, known as &quot;gender liminality&quot;. Some traditional Dineh of the Southwestern US recognize a spectrum of four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, masculine man. The term &quot;third gender&quot; has also been used to describe the &quot;hijras&quot; of South Asia who have gained legal identity, the &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; of Polynesia, and the Albanian sworn virgins.

In some indigenous communities in Africa, a woman can be recognized as a &quot;female husband&quot; who enjoys all the privileges of men and is recognized as such, but whose femaleness, while not openly acknowledged, is not forgotten either.

The hijras of South Asia are one of the most recognized groups of third gender people. Some western commentators (Hines and Sanger) have theorized that this could be a result of the Hindu belief in reincarnation, in which gender, sex, and even species can change from lifetime to lifetime, perhaps allowing for a more fluid interpretation. There are other cultures in which the third gender is seen as an intermediate state of being rather than as a movement from one conventional sex to the other.

In a study of people in the United States who thought themselves to be members of a third gender, Ingrid M. Sell found that they typically felt different from the age of 5. Because of both peer and parental pressure, those growing up with the most ambiguous appearances had the most troubled childhoods and difficulties later in life. Sell also discovered similarities between the third genders of the East and those of the West. Nearly half of those interviewed were healers or in the medical profession. Many of them, again like their Eastern counterparts, were artistic, and several were able to make a living from their artistic abilities. The capacity to mediate between men and women was a common skill, and third genders were oftentimes thought to possess an unusually wide perspective and the ability to understand both sides. A notable result of Sell&#x27;s study is that 93% of the third genders interviewed, again like their Eastern counterparts, reported &quot;paranormal&quot;-type abilities.
In recent years, some Western societies have begun to recognize non-binary or genderqueer identities. Some years after Alex MacFarlane, Australian Norrie May-Welby was recognized as having unspecified status. In 2016, an Oregon circuit court ruled that a resident, Elisa Rae Shupe, could legally change gender to non-binary.

The Open Society Foundations published a report, &quot;License to Be Yourself&quot; in May 2014, documenting &quot;some of the world&#x27;s most progressive and rights-based laws and policies that enable trans people to change their gender identity on official documents&quot;. The report comments on the recognition of third classifications, stating:
The document also quotes Mauro Cabral of GATE:
The report concludes that two or three options are insufficient: &quot;A more inclusive approach would be to increase options for people to self-define their sex and gender identity.&quot;

=== Third gender and sexual orientation ===
Before the sexual revolution of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary in modern English for non-heterosexuality; terms such as &quot;third gender&quot; trace back to the 1860s.

One such term, Uranian, was used in the 19th century for a person of a third sex—originally, someone with &quot;a female psyche in a male body&quot; who is sexually attracted to men. Its definition was later extended to cover homosexual gender variant females and a number of other sexual types. It is believed to be an English adaptation of the German word &quot;Urning&quot;, which was first published by activist Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (1825–95) in a series of five booklets (1864–65) that were collected under the title &quot;Forschungen über das Räthsel der mannmännlichen Liebe&quot; (&quot;Research into the Riddle of Man-Male Love&quot;). Ulrich developed his terminology before the first public use of the term &quot;homosexual&quot;, which appeared in 1869 in a pamphlet published anonymously by Karl-Maria Kertbeny (1824–82). Ulrich is widely regarded as one of the pioneering theorists who advocated for the natural occurrence of same-sex attraction, and he believed that such an orientation does not warrant criminalization. The word Uranian (&quot;Urning&quot;) was derived by Ulrichs from the Greek goddess Aphrodite Urania, who was created out of the god Uranus&#x27; testicles. German lesbian activist Anna Rüling used the term in a 1904 speech, &quot;What Interest Does the Women&#x27;s Movement Have in Solving the Homosexual Problem?&quot;[&quot;&quot;]

According to some scholars, the West is trying to reinterpret and redefine ancient third-gender identities to fit the Western concept of sexual orientation. In &quot;Redefining Fa&#x27;afafine: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa&quot;, Johanna Schmidt argues that the Western attempts to reinterpret fa&#x27;afafine, the third gender in Samoan culture, make it have more to do with sexual orientation than gender. She also argues that this is actually changing the nature of fa&#x27;afafine itself, and making it more &quot;homosexual&quot;.

A Samoan fa&#x27;afafine said, &quot;But I would like to pursue a master&#x27;s degree with a paper on homosexuality from a Samoan perspective that would be written for educational purposes because I believe some of the stuff that has been written about us is quite wrong.&quot;

In &quot;How to become a Berdache: Toward a unified analysis of gender diversity&quot;, Will Roscoe, using an anthropological term Indigenous people have always found offensive, writes that &quot;this pattern can be traced from the earliest accounts of the Spaniards to present-day ethnographies. What has been written about berdaches reflects more the influence of existing Western discourses on gender, sexuality and the Other than what observers actually witnessed.&quot;

According to Towle and Morgan:

Western scholars often do not make a distinction between people of the third gender and males; they are often lumped together. The scholars usually use gender roles as a way to explain sexual relations between the third gender and males. For example, when analyzing the non-normative sex gender categories in Theravada Buddhism, Peter A. Jackson says it appears that within early Buddhist communities, men who engaged in receptive anal sex were seen as feminized and were thought to be hermaphrodites. In contrast, men who engaged in oral sex were not seen as crossing sex/gender boundaries, but rather as engaging in abnormal sexual practices without threatening their masculine gendered existence.

Some writers suggest that a third gender emerged around 1700 in England: the male sodomite. According to these writers, this was marked by the emergence of a subculture of effeminate males and their meeting places (molly houses), as well as a marked increase in hostility towards effeminate or homosexual males. People described themselves as members of a third sex in Europe from at least the 1860s with the writings of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs and continuing in the late nineteenth century with Magnus Hirschfeld, John Addington Symonds, Edward Carpenter, Aimée Duc and others. These writers described themselves and those like them as being of an &quot;inverted&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; sex and experiencing homosexual desire, and their writing argued for social acceptance of such sexual intermediates. Many cited precedents from classical Greek and Sanskrit literature (see below).

Throughout much of the twentieth century, the term &quot;third sex&quot; was a common descriptor for homosexuals and gender nonconformists, but after the gay liberation movements of the 1970s and a growing separation of the concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity, the term fell out of favor among LGBT communities and the wider public. With the renewed exploration of gender that feminism, the modern transgender movement, and queer theory has fostered, some in the contemporary West have begun to describe themselves as a third sex again. Other modern identities that cover similar ground include pangender, bigender, genderqueer, androgyne, intergender, &quot;other gender&quot; and &quot;differently gendered&quot;.

=== Third gender and feminism ===
In Wilhelmine Germany, the terms &quot;drittes Geschlecht&quot; (&quot;third sex&quot;) and &quot;Mannweib&quot; (&quot;man-woman&quot;) were also used to describe feminists – both by their opponents and sometimes by feminists themselves. In the 1899 novel &quot;Das dritte Geschlecht&quot; (&quot;The Third Sex&quot;) by Ernst von Wolzogen, feminists are portrayed as &quot;neuters&quot; with external female characteristics accompanied by a crippled male psyche.

==Legal recognition==
Several countries have adopted laws to accommodate non-binary gender identities. As of 2019, the state of California the United States non-binary has become an option for individuals to select the sex category on their driver&#x27;s license, birth certificates, and identity cards; this all became possible with the passing of California&#x27;s Gender Recognition Act (SB 179).

==Modern societies without legal recognition==
The following gender categories have also been described as a third gender:

===Africa===
* Angola: &quot;Chibados,&quot; third-gendered shamans in the Ndongo kingdom.
* Democratic Republic of the Congo: &quot;Mangaiko&quot; among the Mbo people.
* Kenya: &quot;Mashoga&quot; of Swahili-speaking areas of the Kenyan coast, particularly Mombasa.
* Southern Ethiopia: &quot;Ashtime&quot; of Maale culture

===Asia-Pacific===

* In the Philippines, a number of local sex/gender identities are commonly referred to as a &#x27;third sex&#x27; in popular discourse, as well as by some academic studies. Local terms for these identities (which are considered derogatory by some) include &quot;baklâ&quot; and &quot;binabae&quot; (Tagalog), &quot;bayot&quot; (Cebuano), &quot;agi&quot; (Ilonggo), &quot;bantut&quot; (Tausug), &quot;badíng&quot; – all of which refer to &#x27;gay&#x27; men or trans women. Gender variant females may be called &quot;lakin-on&quot; or tomboy.
* Indonesia: &quot;Waria&quot; is a traditional third gender role found in modern Indonesia. Additionally, the Bugis culture of Sulawesi has been described as having three sexes (male, female and intersex) as well as five genders with distinct social roles.
*Japan: is a transgender identity that is not female or male, similar to &quot;genderqueer&quot; or &quot;nonbinary&quot;. The term X-gender came into use during the latter 1990s, popularized by queer organizations in Kansai, in Osaka and Kyoto. In 2019, Japan LGBT Research Institute Inc. conducted an online survey, collecting 348,000 valid responses from people aged 20 to 69, not all of whom were LGBT. 2.5% of the respondents called themselves X-gender.
* Micronesia: Palao&#x27;ana in Chamorro language, Northern Marianas Islands including Guam.
* Polynesia: &quot;Fa&#x27;afafine&quot; (Samoan), &quot;fakaleiti&quot; (Tongan), &quot;mahu&quot; (Hawaiian), &quot;mahu vahine&quot; (Tahitian), &quot;Rae-Rae&quot; (Tahitian), &quot;whakawahine&quot; (New Zealand Māori), sistergirls and brotherboys (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) and &quot;akava&#x27;ine&quot; (Cook Islands Māori).

===Europe===
* 18th century England: Mollies
* 19th century England: Uranian
* Albania: Sworn virgins, females who work and dress as men and inhabit some men-only spaces, but do not marry.
*&quot;Femminiello&quot;, in Neapolitan culture

===Latin America and the Caribbean===

*&quot;Biza&#x27;ah&quot;: In Teotitlán, they have their own version of the &quot;muxe&quot; that they call biza&#x27;ah. According to Stephen, there were only 7 individuals in that community considered to be biza&#x27;ah in comparison to the muxe, of which there were many. Like the &quot;muxe&quot; they were well-liked and accepted in the community. Their way of walking, talking and the work that they perform are markers of recognizing biza&#x27;ah.
* Southern Mexico: &quot;Muxe&quot;, In many Zapotec communities, third gender roles are often apparent. The &quot;muxe&quot; are described as a third gender; biologically male but with feminine characteristics. They are not considered to be homosexuals, but rather just another gender. Some will marry women and have families, others will form relationships with men. Although it is recognized that these individuals have the bodies of men, they perform gender differently than men, it is not a masculine persona, but neither is it a feminine persona that they perform but, in general, a combination of the two. Lynn Stephen quotes Jeffrey Rubin, &quot;Prominent men who [were] rumoured to be homosexual and did not adopt the &quot;muxe&quot; identity were spoken of pejoratively&quot;, suggesting that &quot;muxe&quot; gender role was more acceptable in the community.
* The travestis of Latin America have been considered an expression of a third gender by a wide range of anthropological studies, although this view has been contested by later authors.
*&quot;Tida wena&quot;: Among the Indigenous Warao people of Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname, people considered to be neither man nor woman. Historically respected, and sometimes serving as shamans or in other honored positions in their tribes, colonization has brought harsher times.

===Middle East===
* Oman: &quot;Xanith&quot; or &quot;khanith&quot;.

=== North American indigenous cultures ===

&quot;Two-Spirit&quot; is a modern umbrella term created at an Indigenous lesbian and gay conference in 1990 with the primary intent of replacing the offensive term &quot;berdache&quot;, which had been, and in some quarters still is, the term used for gay and gender-variant Indigenous people by non-Native anthropologists. &quot;Berdache&quot; has also been used to describe slave boys, sold into sexual servitude. Kyle De Vries writes, &quot;Berdache is a derogatory term created by Europeans and perpetuated by anthropologists and others to define Native American/First Nations people who varied from Western norms that perceive gender, sex, and sexuality as binaries and inseparable.&quot; Mary Annette Pember adds, &quot;Unfortunately, depending on an oral tradition to impart our ways to future generations opened the floodgates for early non-Native explorers, missionaries, and anthropologists to write books describing Native peoples and therefore bolstering their own role as experts. These writings were and still are entrenched in the perspective of the authors who were and are mostly white men.&quot; This has resulted in widely diverse traditions of gender-variant and third-gender traditions among the over 500 living Native American communities being homogenized and misrepresented under English-language names, and widely misinterpreted by both non-Native and disconnected descendants alike. &quot;[&quot;Two-Spirit&quot;] implies that the individual is both male and female and that these aspects are intertwined within them. The term moves away from traditional Native American/First Nations cultural identities and meanings of sexuality and gender variance. It does not take into account the terms and meanings from individual nations and tribes. ... Although &quot;two-spirit&quot; implies to some a spiritual nature, that one holds the spirit of two, both male and female, traditional Native Americans/First Nations peoples view this as a Western concept.&quot;
While some have found the new term two-spirit a useful tool for intertribal organizing, it is not based in the traditional terms, and has not met with acceptance by more traditional communities; the tribes who have traditional ceremonial roles for gender-variant people use names in their own languages, and have generally rejected this &quot;binary&quot; neologism as &quot;Western&quot;.

==History==

=== Old World ===

==== Egypt ====
Inscribed pottery shards from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2000–1800 BCE) found near ancient Thebes (now Luxor, Egypt), list three human genders: &quot;tai&quot; (male), &quot;sḫt&quot; (&quot;sekhet&quot;) and &quot;hmt&quot; (female). &quot;Sḫt&quot; is often translated as &quot;eunuch&quot;, although there is little evidence that such individuals were castrated.

==== Mesopotamia ====

In Mesopotamian mythology, among the earliest written records of humanity, there are references to types of people who are not men and not women. In a Sumerian creation myth found on a stone tablet from the second millennium BC, the goddess Ninmah fashions a being &quot;with no male organ and no female organ&quot;, for whom Enki finds a position in society: &quot;to stand before the king&quot;. In the Akkadian myth of Atra-Hasis (ca. 1700 BC), Enki instructs Nintu, the goddess of birth, to establish a &quot;third category among the people&quot; in addition to men and women, that includes demons who steal infants, women who are unable to give birth, and priestesses who are prohibited from bearing children. In Babylonia, Sumer and Assyria, certain types of individuals who performed religious duties in the service of Inanna/Ishtar have been described as a third gender. They worked as sacred prostitutes or Hierodules, performed ecstatic dance, music and plays, wore masks and had gender characteristics of both women and men. In Sumer, they were given the cuneiform names of ur.sal (&quot;dog/man-woman&quot;) and kur.gar.ra (also described as a man-woman). Modern scholars, struggling to describe them using contemporary sex/gender categories, have variously described them as &quot;living as women&quot;, or used descriptors such as hermaphrodites, eunuchs, homosexuals, transvestites, effeminate males and a range of other terms and phrases.

==== Indic culture ====

References to a third sex can be found throughout the texts of India&#x27;s religious traditions like Jainism and Buddhism – and it can be inferred that Vedic culture recognised three genders. The Vedas (c. 1500 BC–500 BC) describe individuals as belonging to one of three categories, according to one&#x27;s nature or prakrti. These are also spelled out in the Kama Sutra (c. 4th century AD) and elsewhere as &quot;pums-prakrti&quot; (male-nature), &quot;stri-prakrti&quot; (female-nature), and &quot;tritiya-prakrti&quot; (third-nature). Texts suggest that third sex individuals were well known in premodern India and included male-bodied or female-bodied people as well as intersex people, and that they can often be recognised from childhood.

A third sex is discussed in ancient Hindu law, medicine, linguistics and astrology. The foundational work of Hindu law, the Manu Smriti (c. 200 BC–200 AD) explains the biological origins of the three sexes:

A male child is produced by a greater quantity of male seed, a female child by the prevalence of the female; if both are equal, a third-sex child or boy and girl twins are produced; if either are weak or deficient in quantity, a failure of conception results.

Indian linguist Patañjali&#x27;s work on Sanskrit grammar, the Mahābhāṣya (c. 200 BC), states that Sanskrit&#x27;s three grammatical genders are derived from three natural genders. The earliest Tamil grammar, the Tolkappiyam (3rd century BC) refers to hermaphrodites as a third &quot;neuter&quot; gender (in addition to a feminine category of unmasculine males). In Vedic astrology, the nine planets are each assigned to one of the three genders; the third gender, &quot;tritiya-prakrti&quot;, is associated with Mercury, Saturn and (in particular) Ketu. In the Puranas, there are references to three kinds of devas of music and dance: apsaras (female), gandharvas (male) and kinnars (neuter).

The two great Sanskrit epic poems, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, indicates the existence of a third gender in ancient Indic society. Some versions of Ramayana tell that in one part of the story, the hero Rama heads into exile in the forest. Halfway there, he discovers that most of the people of his hometown Ayodhya were following him. He told them, &quot;Men and women, turn back&quot;, and with that, those who were &quot;neither men nor women&quot; did not know what to do, so they stayed there. When Rama returned from exile years later, he discovered them still there and blessed them, saying that there will be a day when they, too, will have a share in ruling the world.

In the Buddhist Vinaya, codified in its present form around the 2nd century BC and said to be handed down by oral tradition from Buddha himself, there are four main sex/gender categories: males, females, &quot;ubhatobyañjanaka&quot; (people of a dual sexual nature) and &quot;paṇḍaka&quot; (people of non-normative sexual natures, perhaps originally denoting a deficiency in male sexual capacity). As the Vinaya tradition developed, the term &quot;paṇḍaka&quot; came to refer to a broad third sex category which encompassed intersex, male and female-bodied people with physical or behavioural attributes that were considered inconsistent with the natural characteristics of man and woman.

==== Greco-Roman Classical Antiquity ====
In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, written around the 4th century BC, Aristophanes relates a creation myth involving three original sexes: female, male and androgynous. They are split in half by Zeus, producing four different contemporary sex/gender types which seek to be reunited with their lost other half; in this account, the modern heterosexual man and woman descend from the original androgynous sex. The myth of Hermaphroditus involves heterosexual lovers merging into their primordial androgynous sex.

Other creation myths around the world share a belief in three original sexes, such as those from northern Thailand.

Many have interpreted the &quot;eunuchs&quot; of the Ancient Eastern Mediterranean world as a third gender that inhabited a liminal space between women and men, understood in their societies as somehow neither or both. In the Historia Augusta, the eunuch body is described as a &quot;tertium genus hominum&quot; (a third human gender). In 77 BC, a eunuch named Genucius was prevented from claiming goods left to him in a will, on the grounds that he had voluntarily mutilated himself (&quot;amputatis sui ipsius&quot;) and was neither a woman or a man (&quot;neque virorum neque mulierum numero&quot;) according to Valerius Maximus. Several scholars have argued that the eunuchs in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament were understood in their time to belong to a third gender, rather than the more recent interpretations of a kind of emasculated man, or a metaphor for chastity. The early Christian theologian, Tertullian, wrote that Jesus himself was a eunuch (c. 200 AD). Tertullian also noted the existence of a third sex (&quot;tertium sexus&quot;) among heathens: &quot;a third race in sex... made of male and female in one.&quot; He may have been referring to the Galli, &quot;eunuch&quot; devotees of the Phrygian goddess Cybele, who were described as belonging to a third sex by several Roman writers.

==== Jewish Diaspora ====
In Rabbinical Jewish traditions there were 6 terms used to describe gender identity:
*&quot;Androgynos&quot;: both male and female genitalia (eternal doubt of legal gender)
*&quot;Ay&#x27;lonit&quot;: Barren female. Female genitalia, barren.
*&quot;Nekeva&quot;: female
*&quot;Saris&quot;: castrated or naturally infertile male (often translated as &quot;eunuch&quot;)
*&quot;Tumtum&quot;: genitalia concealed by skin (unknown gender, unless skin removed)
*&quot;Zachar&quot;: male

==== Early Islamic world ====
Mukhannathun ( &quot;effeminate ones&quot;, &quot;ones who resemble women&quot;, singular &quot;mukhannath&quot;) was a term used in Classical Arabic to refer to effeminate men or people of ambiguous sex characteristics who appeared feminine or functioned socially in roles typically carried out by women. According to the Iranian scholar Mehrdad Alipour, &quot;in the premodern period, Muslim societies were aware of five manifestations of gender ambiguity: This can be seen through figures such as the &quot;khasi&quot; (eunuch), the &quot;hijra&quot;, the &quot;mukhannath&quot;, the &quot;mamsuh&quot; and the &quot;khuntha&quot; (hermaphrodite/intersex).&quot; Western scholars Aisya Aymanee M. Zaharin and Maria Pallotta-Chiarolli give the following explanation of the meaning of the term &quot;mukhannath&quot; and its derivate Arabic forms in the hadith literature: &quot;Mukhannathun&quot;, especially those in the city of Medina, are mentioned throughout the hadith and in the works of many early Arabic and Islamic writers. During the Rashidun era and first half of the Umayyad era, they were strongly associated with music and entertainment. During the Abbasid caliphate, the word itself was used as a descriptor for men employed as dancers, musicians, or comedians.

Mukhannathun existed in pre-Islamic Arabia, during the time of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and early Islamic eras. A number of hadith indicate that &quot;mukhannathun&quot; were used as male servants for wealthy women in the early days of Islam, due to the belief that they were not sexually interested in the female body. These sources do not state that the &quot;mukhannathun&quot; were homosexual, only that they &quot;lack desire&quot;. In later eras, the term &quot;mukhannath&quot; was associated with the receptive partner in gay sexual practices, an association that has persisted into the modern day. &quot;Khanith&quot; is a vernacular Arabic term used in some parts of the Arabian Peninsula to denote the gender role ascribed to males and occasionally intersex people who function sexually, and in some ways socially, as women. The term is closely related to the word &quot;mukhannath&quot;.

Early Islamic literature rarely comments upon the habits of the &quot;mukhannathun&quot;. It seems there may have been some variance in how &quot;effeminate&quot; they were, though there are indications that some adopted aspects of feminine dress or at least ornamentation. Some thirteenth and fourteenth-century scholars like al-Nawawi and al-Kirmani classified &quot;mukhannathun&quot; into two groups: those whose feminine traits seem unchangeable, despite the person&#x27;s best efforts to stop them, and those whose traits are changeable but refuse to stop. Islamic scholars like Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani stated that all &quot;mukhannathun&quot; must make an effort to cease their feminine behavior, but if this proved impossible, they were not worthy of punishment. Those who made no effort to become less &quot;effeminate&quot;, or seemed to &quot;take pleasure in (his effeminacy)&quot;, were worthy of blame. By this era, &quot;mukhannath&quot; had developed its association with homosexuality, and Badr al-Din al-Ayni saw homosexuality as &quot;a more heinous extension of &quot;takhannuth&quot;&quot;, or effeminate behavior.

One particularly prominent &quot;mukhannath&quot; with the &quot;laqab&quot; Ṭuways (&quot;little peacock&quot;) was born in Medina on the day Muhammad died. There are few sources that describe why Tuways was labeled a &quot;mukhannath&quot;, or what behavior of his was considered effeminate. No sources describe his sexuality as immoral or imply that he was attracted to men, and he is reported to have married a woman and fathered several children in his later life. While he is described as non-religious or even frivolous towards religion in many sources, others contradict this and portray him as a believing Muslim instead. His main association with the label seems to come from his profession, as music was mainly performed by women in Arab societies.

===Pre-Columbian Americas===
====Mesoamerica====
The ancient Maya civilization may have recognised a third gender, according to historian Matthew Looper. Looper notes the androgynous Maize Deity and masculine Moon goddess of Maya mythology, and iconography and inscriptions where rulers embody or impersonate these deities. He suggests that a Mayan third gender might also have included individuals with special roles such as healers or diviners.

Anthropologist and archaeologist Miranda Stockett notes that several writers have felt the need to move beyond a two-gender framework when discussing prehispanic cultures across mesoamerica, and concludes that the Olmec, Aztec and Maya peoples understood &quot;more than two kinds of bodies and more than two kinds of gender.&quot; Anthropologist Rosemary Joyce agrees, writing that &quot;gender was a fluid potential, not a fixed category before the Spaniards came to Mesoamerica. Childhood training and ritual shaped, but did not set, adult gender, which could encompass third genders and alternative sexualities as well as &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female.&quot; At the height of the Classic period, Maya rulers presented themselves as embodying the entire range of gender possibilities, from the male through the female, by wearing blended costumes and playing male and female roles in state ceremonies.&quot; Joyce notes that many figures of Mesoamerican art are depicted with male genitalia and female breasts, while she suggests that other figures in which chests and waists are exposed but no sexual characteristics (primary or secondary) are marked may represent a third sex, ambiguous gender, or androgyny.

====Inca====
Andean Studies scholar Michael Horswell writes that third-gendered ritual attendants to &quot;chuqui chinchay&quot;, a jaguar deity in Incan mythology, were &quot;vital actors in Andean ceremonies&quot; prior to Spanish colonisation. Horswell elaborates: &quot;These &quot;quariwarmi&quot; (men-women) shamans mediated between the symmetrically dualistic spheres of Andean cosmology and daily life by performing rituals that at times required same-sex erotic practices. Their transvested attire served as a visible sign of a third space that negotiated between the masculine and the feminine, the present and the past, the living and the dead. Their shamanic presence invoked the androgynous creative force often represented in Andean mythology.&quot; Richard Trexler gives an early Spanish account of religious &#x27;third gender&#x27; figures from the Inca empire in his 1995 book &quot;Sex and Conquest&quot;:

====Indigenous North Americans====
With over 500 surviving Indigenous North American cultures, attitudes about sex and gender are diverse. Historically, some communities have had social or spiritual roles for people who in some way may manifest a third-gender, or another gender-variant way of being, at least some of the time, by their particular culture&#x27;s standards. Some of these ways continue today, while others have died out due to colonialism. Some communities and individuals have adopted the pan-Indian neologism Two-spirit as a way of honoring contemporary figures and organizing intertribally.

==== Inuit ====
Inuit religion states that one of the first angakkuq was a third gender being known as Itijjuaq who discovered the first amulet.

Historically, Inuit in areas of the Canadian Arctic, such as Igloolik and Nunavik, had a third gender concept called &quot;sipiniq&quot; (). A &quot;sipiniq&quot; infant was believed to have changed their physical sex from male to female at the moment of birth. &quot;Sipiniq&quot; children were regarded as socially male, and would be named after a male relative, perform a male&#x27;s tasks, and would wear traditional clothing tailored for men&#x27;s tasks. This generally lasted until puberty, but in some cases continued into adulthood and even after the &quot;sipiniq&quot; person married a man. The Netsilik Inuit used the word &quot;kipijuituq&quot; for a similar concept.

==Art, literature, and media==
In David Lindsay&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; there is a type of being called &quot;phaen&quot;, a third gender which is attracted neither to men nor women but to &quot;Faceny&quot; (their name for Shaping or Crystalman, the Demiurge). The appropriate pronouns are &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;aer&quot;.

&quot;Mikaël&quot;, a 1924 film directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer, was also released as &quot;Chained: The Story of the Third Sex&quot; in the USA.

Literary critic Michael Maiwald identifies a &quot;third-sex ideal&quot; in one of the first African-American bestsellers, Claude McKay&#x27;s &quot;Home to Harlem&quot; (1928).

Djuna Barnes&#x27; 1936 novel &quot;Nightwood&quot; touches on the &quot;third sex&quot; in the chapter Go Down, Matthew (148).

Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s 1969 novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; identifies seven human sexes (not genders) in the fourth dimension required for reproduction including gay men, women over 65, and infants who died before their first birthday. The Tralfamadorian race has five sexes.

In &quot;bro&#x27;Town&quot; (2004–2009), Brother Ken is the principal of the school and is &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot;, a Samoan concept for a third gender, a person who is born biologically male but is raised and sees themself as female. Because the concept does not readily translate, when the series was broadcast on Adult Swim Latin America, a decision was made not to translate Samoan words and just present them as part of the &quot;cultural journey&quot;. 

In &quot;Knights of Sidonia&quot; (2014–2015), Izana Shinatose belongs to a new, nonbinary third gender that originated during the hundreds of years of human emigration into space, as first shown in the episode &quot;Commencement.&quot; Izana later turns into a girl after falling in love with Nagate Tanasake.

==Spirituality==
In Hinduism, Shiva is still worshipped as an Ardhnarishwara, i.e. half-male and half-female form. Shiva&#x27;s symbol, which is today known as Shivalinga, actually comprises a combination of a &#x27;Yoni&#x27; (vagina) and a &#x27;Lingam&#x27; (phallus).

At the turn of the common era, male cults devoted to a goddess that flourished throughout the broad region extending from the Mediterranean to South Asia. While galli were missionizing the Roman Empire, kalū, kurgarrū, and assinnu continued to carry out ancient rites in the temples of Mesopotamia, and the third-gender predecessors of the hijra were clearly evident. It should also be mentioned of the eunuch priests of Artemis at Ephesus; the western Semitic qedeshim, the male &quot;temple prostitutes&quot; known from the Hebrew Bible and Ugaritic texts of the late second millennium; and the keleb, priests of Astarte at Kition and elsewhere. Beyond India, modern ethnographic literature documents gender-variant shaman-priests throughout Southeast Asia, Borneo, and Sulawesi. All these roles share the traits of devotion to a goddess, gender transgression and receptive anal sex, ecstatic ritual techniques (for healing, in the case of kalū and Mesopotamian priests, and fertility in the case of hijra), and actual (or symbolic) castration. Most, at some point in their history, were based in temples and, therefore, part of the religious-economic administration of their respective city-states.

The Islamic conception of the &quot;perfect human being&quot; (&quot;al-Insān al-Kāmil&quot;) is, as evident from the writings of ibn Arabi, genderless, and both women and men could equally attain this stage of spiritual development, which is further reflected in genderless form of the term &quot;kamāl&quot;.

== Criticism ==
Scholars have made several criticisms of the third gender concept. These critiques regard primarily Western scholars&#x27; use of the concept to understand gender in other cultures in an ethnocentric way. Third gender has also been criticized as a reductionist &quot;junk drawer&quot; used for all identities beyond the Western gender binary, ignoring the nuance of various identities, histories, and practices in other cultures to situate them in a Western understanding. As Towle and Morgan write, &quot;The term third gender does not disrupt gender binarism; it simply adds another category (albeit a segregated, ghettoized category) to the existing two.&quot; Towle and Morgan additionally note that Western scholars may incorrectly treat non-Western third gender examples as though they existed prior to and serve as the foundation for modern Western understandings of gender variability. This implication makes it difficult for Western scholars to understand how non-Western cultures view and value sex and gender in their own societies in both the present day and historically.
