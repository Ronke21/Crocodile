<text>Guillaume Brune, 1st Count Brune (, 13 March 1764 – 2 August 1815) was a French military commander, Marshal of the Empire, and political figure who served during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.

== Early life ==
Brune was born in Brives (now called Brive-la-Gaillarde) in the province of Limousin, the son of Étienne Brune, a lawyer, and Jeanne Vielbains. He moved to Paris in 1785, studied law, and became a political journalist. He embraced the ideas of the French Revolution, and soon after its outbreak enlisted in the Parisian National Guard and joined the Cordeliers, eventually becoming a friend of Georges Danton.

== Revolutionary Wars ==
Brune fought in Bordeaux during the Federalist revolts at Hondschoote and Fleurus. In 1793, Brune was appointed brigadier general and took part in the fighting of the 13 Vendémiaire (5 October 1795) against royalist insurgents in Paris.

In 1796, he served under Napoleon Bonaparte in the Italian campaign and was promoted to &quot;général de division&quot; allegedly so as to avoid Napoleon having to concede the post to Bernadotte, who was at this time a political rival to Napoleon. Brune was noted as having been particularly incompetent; one anecdote has him attempting to march three divisions down the same road, leading to confusion among the army of Italy. He was subsequently removed from command. Brune commanded the French army that occupied Switzerland in 1798 and established the Helvetic Republic. In the following year, he was in command of the French troops in defence of Amsterdam against the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland under the Duke of York, in which he was completely successful – the Anglo-Russian forces were defeated in the Battle of Castricum, and compelled, after a harsh retreat, to re-embark. He rendered further good service in Vendée and in the Italian Peninsula from 1799 to 1801, winning the 1800 Battle of Pozzolo.

In 1802, Napoleon dispatched Brune to Constantinople as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. During his two-year diplomatic service, he initiated relations between France and Persia.

== Napoleonic Wars ==
Following his coronation as Emperor of the French in 1804, Napoleon made Brune a Marshal of the Empire (&quot;Maréchal d&#x27;Empire&quot;) while he was still in Constantinople. During the campaigns against Austria during the War of the Third Coalition, Marshal Brune commanded the army in Boulogne from 1805 to 1807 overseeing drilling and keeping a watchful eye on the British. In 1807 Brune was appointed Governor General for the Hanseatic Ports and in 1808, Brune held a command of troops fighting in War of the Fourth Coalition and occupied Swedish Pomerania, taking Stralsund and the Island of Rugen. Despite these victories, his staunch republicanism and a meeting with Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden raised Napoleon&#x27;s suspicions. These suspicions were only made worse by Brune, who refused to talk to Napoleon about the matter, claiming simply that &quot;It&#x27;s a lie&quot;. Brune made his biggest blunder while drafting a treaty between France and Sweden when he wrote &quot;the French army&quot; instead of &quot;His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Army&quot;. Whether an intentional insult or act of incompetence, Napoleon was infuriated and Brune was removed from duty. He then spent the next years at his country estate in disgrace and was not re-employed until 1815.

== Hundred Days and death ==
After Napoleon&#x27;s abdication, Brune was awarded the Cross of Saint Louis by Louis XVIII, but rallied to the emperor&#x27;s cause after his escape from exile in Elba. Leaving behind their past quarrels, Napoleon appointed Brune commander of the Army of the Var during the Hundred Days. Here he defended Southern France against the forces of the Austrian Empire and Kingdom of Sardinia, with the addition of the British Mediterranean Fleet and local Royalist guerrillas. Brune, while he held Liguria, slowly began to retreat, holding Toulon. Brune kept the mobs in Marseille and Provence under control.

On 22 July 1815, after hearing of the defeat at Waterloo, Brune surrendered Toulon to the British. Fearing the Royalist mobs in Provence and aware of their hatred towards him, Brune asked Admiral Edward Pellew to sail him to Italy, but the request was rudely denied, with Pellew calling him &quot;the prince of scamps&quot; and a &quot;blackguard&quot;. Brune then decided to travel to Paris over land with the promise of Royalist protection, although none was provided. He managed to arrive safely with two aides-de-camp in Avignon, but was there shot and killed by an angry Royalist mob after being chased into a hotel, as a victim of the Second White Terror. The new Bourbon government soon fabricated the story that Brune had committed suicide. His body, thrown into the River Rhone, was retrieved by a fisherman and buried by local farmers and was later recovered by his wife Angélique Nicole Pierre to be buried in the cemetery of Saint-Just-Sauvage.

An inquiry compelled by his widow later made public that Brune&#x27;s murder had been covered up by the royal authorities, and revealed that the mob responsible was led by baseless allegations that Brune was the one parading Marie Thérèse Louise of Savoy, Princesse de Lamballe&#x27; head on a pike around Paris during the September Massacres. In 1839, one year after Angélique&#x27;s death, a monument to Marshal Brune was erected in his hometown of Brives.

== Family ==
In 1793, Brune married Angélique Nicole Pierre, from Arpajon. They had no issue but adopted two daughters.

<text>Barthélemy Catherine Joubert (, 14 April 1769 – 15 August 1799) was a French general who served during the French Revolutionary Wars. Recognizing his talents, Napoleon Bonaparte gave him increased responsibilities. Joubert was killed while commanding the French army at the Battle of Novi in 1799.

==Early life and career==
The son of an advocate, Joubert was born at Pont-de-Vaux (Ain), and ran away from school in 1784 to enlist in the artillery. He was brought back and sent to study law at Lyon and Dijon. In 1791, during the French Revolutionary Wars, he joined the French Revolutionary Army regiment of the Ain, and was elected by his comrades successively as corporal and sergeant. In January 1792 he was promoted to &quot;sous-lieutenant&quot;, and in November became a lieutenant, having in the meantime participated in his first campaign with the army of Italy.

In 1793, Joubert distinguished himself during the defence of a redoubt at the Col de Tende in north-west Italy, where he led only thirty men against a battalion of the enemy. After being wounded and captured in the battle, he was released on parole by Austrian Commander-in-Chief Joseph Nikolaus de Vins. In 1794 he was again actively engaged, and received a promotion to brigadier general on 24 December 1795.

==1796–97==
In the campaign of 1796, Joubert became part of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s overall command. He led a brigade under Pierre Augereau in the Battle of Millesimo and under André Masséna at the Battle of Lodi. He also participated in the Battle of Castiglione in August. Joubert quickly attracted the special attention of Napoleon Bonaparte, who promoted him to general of a division in December 1796.

Bonaparte repeatedly selected him for the command of important detachments, including the holding force in the Adige River valley at the Battle of Rivoli. During the spring campaign of 1797 (invasion of Austria) he commanded the detached left wing of Bonaparte&#x27;s army in the Tyrol. He distinguished himself by fighting his way through the mountains to rejoin his chief in Styria. In February 1797, General Joubert intervened against Tyrolean companies of sharpshooters, issuing an angry message to crush their resistance: &quot;I declare that I consider as enemies of the French, all the fathers, whose children are enrolled in the Tyrolean companies of sharpshooters, will be imprisoned and their property confiscated for the benefit of the Republic .&quot;

==1798–99==
He subsequently held various commands in the Low Countries, on the Rhine and in the Italian Peninsula, where he served as commander in chief up to January 1799 . On 6 December 1798, he occupied the Piedmontese capital of Turin. Resigning the post due to a dispute with the civil authorities, Joubert returned to France. There, he married (in June 1799) Mlle de Montholon, who was the daughter of Charles-Louis Huguet de Sémonville, and the future wife of Marshal Jacques Macdonald. 

Joubert was soon summoned to the field to counter a series of major French defeats in northern Italy. He took over command from Jean Moreau in mid-July 1799, who remained as his advisor.

Joubert and Moreau were quickly compelled to give battle by Aleksandr Suvorov, at the head of a joint Russian and Austrian army. The ensuing Battle of Novi was disastrous for the French, not only because it was a defeat, but also because Joubert was among the first to fall, shot through the heart by an infanterist of the Ogulinska 3rd Infantry Regiment. Joubert had at one time been marked out as a future great captain by Napoleon, but became just an another killed French military commander before the Napoleonic Wars. 

After the battle, his remains were brought to Toulon and buried in the Fort La Malgue. The French Directory paid tribute to him with a ceremony on the 16 September 1799. A monument to Joubert erected at Bourg-en-Bresse was later razed by order of Louis XVIII. Another monument stands in the town of his birth at Pont de Vaux.

<text>Karl Rudolf Gerd von Rundstedt (12 December 1875 – 24 February 1953) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) in the &quot;Heer&quot; (Army) of Nazi Germany and &quot;Oberbefehlshaber West&quot; (Commander-in-Chief in the West) during World War II. At the end of the war, aged 69, with over 52 years of service, he was the Army&#x27;s most senior officer.

Born into a Prussian family with a long military tradition, Rundstedt entered the Prussian Army in 1892. During World War I, he served mainly as a staff officer. In the interwar period, he continued his military career, reaching the rank of (Colonel General) before retiring in 1938. He was recalled at the beginning of World War II as commander of Army Group South in the invasion of Poland. He commanded Army Group A during the Battle of France, and requested the Halt Order during the Battle of Dunkirk. He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal in 1940. In the invasion of the Soviet Union, he commanded Army Group South, responsible for the largest encirclement in history, the Battle of Kiev. He was relieved of command in December 1941 after authorizing the withdrawal from Rostov but was recalled in 1942 and appointed Commander-in-Chief in the West.

He was dismissed after the German defeat in Normandy in July 1944 but was again recalled as Commander-in-Chief in the West in September, holding this post until his final dismissal by Adolf Hitler in March 1945. Though aware of the various plots to depose Hitler, Rundstedt neither supported nor reported them. He also served as chairman of the &quot;Ehrenhof&quot;, a military committee discharging 20 July ploters from the Wehrmacht, so that they could be tried and murdered by the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot;, a show trial.

After the war, he was charged with war crimes, but did not face trial due to his age and poor health. He was released in 1949, and died in 1953.

==Early life==
Gerd von Rundstedt was born in Aschersleben, north of Halle in Prussian Saxony (now in Saxony-Anhalt). He was the eldest son of Gerd Arnold Konrad von Rundstedt, a cavalry officer who served in the Franco-Prussian War. The Rundstedts are an old Junker family that traced its origins to the 12th century and classed as members of the &quot;Uradel&quot;, or old nobility, although they held no titles and were not wealthy. Virtually all the Rundstedt men since the time of Frederick the Great had served in the Prussian Army. Rundstedt&#x27;s mother, Adelheid Fischer, was of Huguenot (French Protestant) descent. He was the eldest of four brothers, all of whom became Army officers. Rundstedt&#x27;s education followed the path ordained for Prussian military families: the junior cadet college at Diez, near Koblenz, then the military academy at Lichterfelde in Berlin.

Unable to meet the cost of joining a cavalry regiment, Rundstedt joined the 83rd Infantry Regiment in March 1892 as a cadet officer (). The regiment was based at Kassel in Hesse-Kassel, which he came to regard as his home town and where he maintained a home until 1945. He undertook further training at the military college () at Hannover, before being commissioned as a lieutenant in June 1893. He made a good impression on his superiors. In 1896 he was made regimental adjutant, and in 1903 he was sent to the prestigious War Academy () in Berlin for a three-year staff officer training course. At the end of his course Rundstedt was described as &quot;an outstandingly able officer ... well suited for the General Staff.&quot; He married Luise &quot;Bila&quot; von Goetz in January 1902 and their only child, Hans Gerd von Rundstedt, was born in January 1903.

Rundstedt joined the General Staff of the German Army in April 1907 serving there until July 1914, when he was appointed chief of operations to the 22nd Reserve Infantry Division. This division was part of XI Corps, which in turn was part of General Alexander von Kluck&#x27;s First Army. In 1914 this Army was deployed along the Belgian border, in preparation for the invasion of Belgium and France, in accordance with the German plan for victory in the west known as the Schlieffen Plan.

==World War I==
Rundstedt served as 22nd Division&#x27;s chief of staff during the invasion of Belgium, but he saw no action since his Division was held in reserve during the initial advance. In December 1914, suffering from a lung ailment, he was promoted to Major and transferred to the military government of Antwerp. In April 1915 his health recovered, and he was posted as chief of staff to the 86th Infantry Division which was serving as part of General Max von Gallwitz&#x27;s forces on the Eastern Front. In September he was once again given an administrative post, as part of the military government of German-occupied Poland, based in Warsaw. He stayed in this post until November 1916, until he was promoted by being made chief of staff to an Army Corps, XXV Reserve Corps, which was fighting in the Carpathians. Here he saw much action against the Russians. In October 1917 he was appointed chief of staff to LIII Corps, in northern Poland. The following month, however, the October Revolution led to the collapse of the Russian armies and the end of the war on the eastern front. In August 1918 Rundstedt was transferred to the west, as chief of staff to XV Corps in Alsace, under General Felix Graf von Bothmer. Here he remained until the end of the war in November. Bothmer described him as &quot;a wholly excellent staff officer and amiable comrade.&quot; He was awarded the Iron Cross, first class, and was recommended for the Pour le Mérite, but did not receive it. He thus ended World War I, although still a major, with a high reputation as a staff officer.

==Weimar Republic==
Rundstedt&#x27;s Corps disintegrated in the wake of defeat and the German Revolution, but while most officers were demobilised, he remained in the Army, apparently at the request of General Wilhelm Groener, who assumed leadership of the shattered Army. He briefly rejoined the General Staff, but this was abolished under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, signed in June 1919. In October, Rundstedt was posted to the staff of Military District () V, based in Stuttgart, under General Walter von Bergmann. He was there when the attempted military coup known as the Kapp Putsch took place in March 1920. Bergmann and Rundstedt, like most of the Army leadership, refused to support the coup attempt: Rundstedt later described it as &quot;a failure and a very stupid one at that.&quot; This was not an indication of any fondness for the Weimar Republic on Rundstedt&#x27;s part – he remained a monarchist. It was a reflection of his view that Army officers should not interfere in politics, and should support the government of the day, whatever its nature: a view he was to hold firmly to throughout his career. He testified at the Nuremberg trials in 1946: &quot;We generals did not concern ourselves with politics. We did not take part in any political discussions, and we did not hold any political discussions among ourselves.&quot;

Rundstedt rose steadily in the small 100,000-man army (the ) allowed to Germany by the Versailles Treaty. In May 1920 he was made chief of staff to the 3rd Cavalry Division, based in Weimar, thus achieving his early ambition of being a cavalry commander. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel () in 1920, and to full colonel in 1923, when he was transferred to II, based in Stettin. In 1926 he was made chief of staff to Group Command () 2, which covered the whole of western Germany and was based in Kassel, and promoted to major general (). In 1928 Rundstedt finally left staff positions behind him and was made commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division, based in Breslau. This was considered a front-line posting, given Germany&#x27;s tense relations with Poland and the fact that Poland at this time had a much bigger army than Germany.

In January 1932, Rundstedt was appointed commander of III, based in Berlin, and also given command of the 3rd Infantry Division. This brought him, at 57, into the highest ranks of the German Army, reflected in his promotion to Lieutenant General (). It also inevitably brought him into close contact with the political world, which was in a disturbed state due to the Great Depression and subsequent rise of Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party. The Defence Minister, General Kurt von Schleicher, was scheming to bring the Nazis into the government, and the Chancellor, Franz von Papen, was planning to overthrow the Social Democrat government of Prussia, Germany&#x27;s largest state. Despite his dislike of politics, Rundstedt could not remain uninvolved in these matters. In July 1932 Papen used his emergency powers to dismiss the Prussian Government. Martial law was briefly declared in Berlin and Rundstedt was made martial law plenipotentiary. He protested to Papen about this and martial law was lifted after a few days. In October Rundstedt was promoted to full General and given command of 1, covering the whole of eastern Germany.

==Serving the Nazi regime==
In January 1933 Hitler became chancellor, and within a few months, dictator. The Defence Minister, General Werner von Blomberg, ensured that the Army remained loyal to the new regime. In February he arranged for Hitler to meet with senior generals, including Rundstedt. Hitler assured the generals that he favoured a strong Army and that there would be no interference with its internal affairs. Rundstedt was satisfied with this, but made it clear in private conversations that he did not like the Nazi regime. He also said, however, that he would do nothing to oppose it. In 1934, when General Kurt Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord resigned as chief of staff, Hitler wished to appoint General Walther von Reichenau to succeed him. Rundstedt led a group of senior officers in opposing the appointment, on the grounds that Reichenau was too openly a supporter of the regime. Hitler and Blomberg backed down and General Werner Freiherr von Fritsch was appointed instead. When Fritsch was forced to resign in 1938, Rundstedt again blocked Reichenau&#x27;s appointment, and the post went to General Walther von Brauchitsch.

Like most of the Army, Rundstedt feared the growing power of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and was relieved when it was purged, although he and many others were angered that two generals, Schleicher and von Bredow, were killed. He was among the senior officers who later persuaded Hitler to have these two officers posthumously (but secretly) rehabilitated. Some sources also claim he was among those senior officers who demanded courts-martial for those responsible for the murders, although Rundstedt didn&#x27;t testify to that at Nuremberg. The Army was uncomfortable with the purge but Rundstedt, and the rest of the Army, still took the personal oath of loyalty to Hitler that Blomberg introduced. Rundstedt also supported the regime&#x27;s plans for rearmament, culminating in the denunciation of the Treaty of Versailles in 1935, which was followed by the reintroduction of conscription. By 1935, when he turned 60, Rundstedt was the senior officer of the German Army in terms of service, and second only to Blomberg in rank. Recognising his status, Hitler cultivated him, appointing him as Germany&#x27;s representative at the funeral of King George V in January 1936.

Given his prestige, Rundstedt was a central figure in the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair which engulfed the German Army in early 1938. This was a political manoeuvre by senior Nazis Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler to strengthen their positions within the Nazi regime at the expense of the military leadership. Together they forced the resignation of both Blomberg and Fritsch, the former under threat of blackmail because of his second wife&#x27;s dubious past, and the latter on fabricated charges of homosexuality. On 31 January, Rundstedt and the Army Chief of Staff, General Ludwig Beck, representing the officer corps, had an angry meeting with Hitler. Rundstedt agreed that Blomberg had disgraced himself and demanded that he be court-martialled, which Hitler refused. On the other hand, he defended Fritsch, correctly accusing Himmler of having fabricated the allegations against him. He insisted that Fritsch have the right to defend himself before a Court of Honour, which Hitler reluctantly agreed to. Beck promoted Rundstedt as Fritsch&#x27;s successor, but Rundstedt declined, and the post went to Brauchitsch. At Beck&#x27;s urging, Fritsch challenged Himmler to a duel, but Rundstedt (as senior officer of the Army) declined to pass on Fritsch&#x27;s letter.

During 1938 and 1939 Beck and other senior officers were hatching plots to remove Hitler from power if he provoked a new war with Britain and France over Czechoslovakia or Poland, a war they were convinced Germany would lose. Rundstedt was aware of these plots, and Beck tried to recruit him to the plotters&#x27; ranks, knowing of his disdain for the Nazi regime. But Rundstedt stuck firmly to his position that officers should not be involved in politics, no matter how grave the issues at stake. On the other hand, he did not report these approaches to Hitler or the Gestapo, then or later. From a purely military point of view, Rundstedt was apprehensive about Hitler&#x27;s plans to attack Czechoslovakia, since he believed that Britain and France would intervene and Germany would be defeated. Brauchitsch lacked the courage to oppose Hitler directly, but agreed to Beck&#x27;s request for a meeting of senior commanders. At the meeting widespread opposition to Hitler&#x27;s plans to coerce Czechoslovakia over the Sudetenland issue was expressed. Beck urged the officers to oppose Hitler&#x27;s plans openly, but Rundstedt, while agreeing about the dangers of war before Germany was fully re-armed, would not support him, but declared himself unwilling to provoke a new crisis between Hitler and the Army. He advised Brauchitsch not to confront Hitler, apparently afraid that Brauchitsch would be dismissed and replaced by Reichenau. When Hitler heard about the meeting, Beck was forced to resign. Even after this, two of Rundstedt&#x27;s friends, Generals Erwin von Witzleben and Erich Hoepner, remained involved in anti-Hitler plots and continued to try to recruit him.

In November 1938, shortly after his division had taken part in the bloodless occupation of the Sudetenland, Rundstedt retired from the Army with the rank of Colonel-General (), second only to the rank of Field Marshal. It was suggested that Hitler had forced him out, either because of his opposition to the plan to invade Czechoslovakia or because of his support for Fritsch, but this seems not be the case: he had in fact asked permission to retire some time earlier. Just short of his 63rd birthday, he was not in good health and missed his family – he was now a grandfather. Moreover, despite their recent confrontations, he remained on good terms with Hitler, who made him honorary colonel () of his old regiment on his retirement. Rundstedt also agreed that in the event of war he would return to active service.

==World War II==
===Invasion of Poland===
Rundstedt&#x27;s retirement did not last long. By early 1939 Hitler had decided to force a confrontation with Poland over the Polish Corridor, and planning for a war with Poland began. In May, Hitler approved Rundstedt&#x27;s appointment as commander of Army Group South, to invade Poland from Silesia and Slovakia. His chief of staff was General Erich von Manstein, his chief of operations Colonel Günther Blumentritt. His principal field commanders would be (from west to east as they entered Poland) General Johannes Blaskowitz (8th Army), General Walther von Reichenau (10th Army), and General Wilhelm List (14 Army).

Rundstedt&#x27;s armies advanced rapidly into southern Poland, capturing Kraków on 6 September, but Reichenau&#x27;s over-ambitious attempt to take Warsaw by storm on 9 September was repelled. Soon after, Blaskowitz&#x27;s exposed northern flank was attacked by the Polish Poznań Army, leading to the major engagement of the Polish campaign, the Battle of the Bzura. Rundstedt and Manstein travelled to Blaskowitz&#x27;s headquarters to take charge, and by 11 September the Poles had been contained in a pocket around Kutno. By 18 September the Poznan Army had been destroyed, and Warsaw was besieged. Reichenau&#x27;s forces took Lublin on 11 September, while List&#x27;s army was advancing to the east towards Lvov, where they eventually linked up with Soviet forces advancing from the east under the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Warsaw surrendered on 28 September, and by 6 October fighting in southern Poland had ceased.

From the first days of the invasion, there had been incidents of German troops shooting Polish soldiers after they had surrendered, and killing civilians, especially Polish Jews. Some of these incidents were the work of units of the SS-VT, forerunner of the Waffen-SS, but some involved regular Army units. Rundstedt&#x27;s biographer says: &quot;There is certainly no evidence that Rundstedt ever condoned, let alone encouraged, these acts.&quot; Rundstedt told Reichenau that such actions did not have his authorisation. In fact, both Rundstedt and Blaskowitz complained to the chief of staff, General Franz Halder, about the Army Command&#x27;s apparent tolerance of such incidents. Nevertheless, as commander of Army Group South, Rundstedt was legally responsible for the behaviour of his troops, and these incidents later formed part of the charges of war crimes against him.

Behind the Army came SS (task forces) commanded by Theodor Eicke, who began systematically executing Jews and members of the Polish educated classes. One commanded by Udo von Woyrsch operated in 14th Army&#x27;s area. At Dynów Woyrsch&#x27;s men herded the town&#x27;s Jews into the synagogue then burned it down. By 20 September, over 500 Jews had been killed. In 1939, this was still too much for most German Army officers to stand. After complaints from numerous officers, Rundstedt banned Woyrsch&#x27;s units from the area, but after his departure his order was rescinded. On 20 October Rundstedt resigned his command and was transferred to the western front.

===Invasion of France and the Low Countries===
On 25 October, Rundstedt took up his new post as commander of Army Group A, facing the French border in the Ardennes mountains sector, and based in Koblenz. To his north Army Group B under General Fedor von Bock faced the Dutch and Belgian borders, while to his south Army Group C under General Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb faced the French along the Maginot Line. Manstein was again his chief of staff and Blumentritt his chief of operations, although Manstein soon departed to command an infantry corps and was replaced by General Georg von Sodenstern. Rundstedt&#x27;s main field commanders (from north to south) were Blaskowitz (9th Army), List (12th Army) and General Ernst Busch (16th Army).
Hitler&#x27;s original plan was to attack in late November, before the French and British had time fully to deploy along their front. The plan, devised by Hitler, was essentially for a re-run of the invasion of 1914, with the main assault to come in the north, through Belgium and the Netherlands, then wheeling south to capture Paris, leaving the French Army anchored on the Maginot Line. Most senior officers were opposed to both the timing and the plan. Rundstedt, Manstein, Reichenau (commanding 6th Army in Army Group B), List and Brauchitsch remonstrated with Hitler in a series of meetings in October and November. They were opposed to an offensive so close to the onset of winter, and they were opposed to launching the main attack through Belgium, where the many rivers and canals would hamper armoured operations. Manstein in particular, supported by Rundstedt, argued for an armoured assault by Army Group A, across the Ardennes to the sea, cutting the British and French off in Belgium. This &quot;Manstein Plan&quot; was the genesis of the blitzkrieg of May 1940.

A combination of bad weather, the arguments of his generals, and a breach of security when the details of the original plan fell into Allied hands, eventually led Hitler to agree to postpone the attack until early 1940, when it was again delayed by the invasion of Denmark and Norway. In February, Hitler finally accepted the Manstein Plan. General Günther von Kluge&#x27;s 4th Army and General Maximilian Reichsfreiherr von Weichs&#x27;s 2nd Army were transferred from Army Group B to Rundstedt&#x27;s command. General Ewald von Kleist was now to command Panzer (Armoured) Group Kleist, consisting of three armoured corps, led by Heinz Guderian, Georg-Hans Reinhardt and Gustav Anton von Wietersheim. These armoured corps were to be the spearhead of the German thrust into France. Although Manstein is often credited for the change of plans, he himself acknowledged Rundstedt&#x27;s decisive role. &quot;I would stress that my commander, Colonel-General von Rundstedt, agreed with my view throughout, and backed our recommendations to the full. Without his sanction we could never have kept up our attempts to change OKW&#x27;s mind.&quot;

During this hiatus, the group of senior officers who were plotting against Hitler&#x27;s war plans, led by Halder, renewed their efforts, convinced that an attack in the west would lead to a war which Germany would lose. Brauchitsch agreed with Halder&#x27;s fears, but continued to vacillate about opposing Hitler – he asked Reichenau and Rundstedt to remonstrate with Hitler, but they refused. Witzleben suggested that Rundstedt, Leeb and Bock should jointly refuse to carry out Hitler&#x27;s orders to carry out the attack. Two of the conspirators, Abwehr officers Hans Oster and Hans Bernd Gisevius, discussed this with Leeb, who turned them down but did not report them. On 13 March, Himmler came to Koblenz to give the generals, including Rundstedt, an ideological lecture, in the course of which he made it clear that the atrocities against civilians which some of them had witnessed in Poland had been carried out on his orders, and with the approval of Hitler. &quot;I do nothing that the Führer does not know&quot;, he said.

The attack was finally launched on 10 May. By 14 May, armoured units under Hermann Hoth and Guderian had crossed the Meuse and had broken open the Allied front. As planned, the British and French had advanced into Belgium to meet Bock&#x27;s offensive, and were in danger of being cut off there by a German thrust to the sea. Both Hitler and Rundstedt had doubts about the safety of allowing the armoured corps to get too far ahead of their infantry support, however. Hitler sent the chief of staff of the Armed Forces Supreme Command (, OKW), General Wilhelm Keitel, to Rundstedt&#x27;s headquarters, to urge caution. In Halder&#x27;s words, Hitler was &quot;frightened by his own success ... afraid to take any chance.&quot; Guderian objected vehemently to being ordered to halt, and Rundstedt was forced to mediate between Hitler and his impetuous armoured commanders, who were backed by Halder. By 20 May, Guderian&#x27;s tanks had reached the sea at Abbeville and closed the trap on the British and French, who were already in retreat to the English Channel ports.

By this time, however, Kleist&#x27;s armoured forces were thinly stretched and had suffered losses of up to 50% of their tanks. Kleist asked Rundstedt for a pause while the armoured units recovered and the infantry caught up, and Rundstedt agreed to this. At the same time, Göring attempted to persuade Hitler that the Luftwaffe could destroy the trapped Allied armies, freeing the German forces to turn south towards Paris. Hitler accepted this view, and on 24 May issued what became known as the Halt Order, preventing the German armour from rapidly capturing Calais and Dunkirk. The Luftwaffe were unable to destroy the Allied armies, however, and the halt allowed the British Expeditionary Force and many French troops to be evacuated from Dunkirk. This decision, for which Hitler, Rundstedt and Kleist shared responsibility, proved very costly to Germany&#x27;s war effort in the long term. After the war, Rundstedt described the Halt Order as &quot;an incredible blunder&quot; and assigned full blame to Hitler. His biographer concedes that this &quot;does not represent the whole truth&quot;, because the original impetus for a pause came from Kleist and Rundstedt himself.

Attention then turned to the attack on the French armies to the south. On 29 May, Hitler came to Rundstedt&#x27;s headquarters at Charleville-Mézières to discuss the new offensive. Bock&#x27;s Army Group B on the right was to advance on Paris, while Rundstedt&#x27;s Army Group A, now consisting only of List&#x27;s 12th Army, Weichs&#x27;s 2nd Army and Busch&#x27;s 16th Army, was to attack towards Soissons and Rheims. Rundstedt&#x27;s attack began on 9 June, and within a few days had broken the French resistance. By 12 June, his forces were across the Marne and advancing south-east towards Alsace. Dijon fell on 16 June and Lyon on 20 June. By this time French resistance was crumbling and on 22 June the French requested an armistice. In July, Hitler announced that Rundstedt and a number of other field commanders were to be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal () during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony. Although Rundstedt wished to resume his retirement, he was persuaded by Hitler to stay in France and set up headquarters at Saint-Germain-en-Laye about outside Paris. There he oversaw the planning for the proposed invasion of Britain, Operation Sealion, but never took the prospects for this operation seriously, and was not surprised when Hitler called it off in September after the Luftwaffe&#x27;s setback in the Battle of Britain. Even then, Rundstedt was not to be allowed to retire, when in October Hitler appointed him Commander-in-Chief West (, or OB West).

===Planning the war against the Soviet Union===
By July 1940 Hitler was turning his mind to the invasion of the Soviet Union, commissioning General Erich Marcks to prepare preliminary plans. Although the Hitler-Stalin pact had served Germany&#x27;s interests well, both strategically and economically, his whole career had been based on anti-communism and the belief that &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot; was the main threat to Germany and the Aryan race. In December Hitler made a firm decision for an attack on the Soviets the following spring, codenamed Operation Barbarossa. At this point Rundstedt learned that he was to give up his quiet life in occupied France and assume command of Army Group South, tasked with the conquest of Ukraine. Leeb would command in the north, heading for Leningrad, and Bock in the centre, charged with capturing Moscow. On the way, the three army groups were to encircle and destroy the Red Army before it could retreat into the Russian interior.

Rundstedt, like most German officers, had favoured the policy of good relations with the Soviets followed by the commander General Hans von Seekt during the Weimar Republic years, when the Soviet connection was seen as a counter to the threat from Poland. He was also apprehensive about launching a new war in the east while Britain was undefeated. If so, he did nothing to oppose them, and in this he was in company even with officers who disliked and opposed Hitler&#x27;s regime, such as Halder, who threw themselves into planning the invasion, and believed it would succeed. Even the most experienced officers shared Hitler&#x27;s contempt for the Soviet state and army. &quot;You have only to kick in the door,&quot; Hitler told Rundstedt, &quot;and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.&quot;

In March Rundstedt left Paris to set up Army Group South&#x27;s headquarters in Breslau. On the way he attended a conference in Berlin at which Hitler addressed senior officers. He made it clear that the ordinary rules of warfare would not apply to the Russian campaign. &quot;This is a war of extermination&quot;, he told them. &quot;We do not wage war to preserve the enemy.&quot; This gave the generals a clear warning that they would be expected not to obstruct Hitler&#x27;s wider war aims in the east – the extermination of the Jews and the reduction of the Slavic peoples to serfdom under a new (Master race) of German settlers. As part of this strategy, the Commissar Order was issued, which stated that all Red Army commissars were to be executed when captured. Rundstedt testified at Nuremberg about the attitude of the Army to this Order: &quot;Our attitude was unanimously and absolutely against it. Immediately after the conference we approached Brauchitsch and told him that this was impossible ... The order was simply not carried out.&quot; This latter statement was clearly untrue, as the Commissar Order was widely carried out. But whether Rundstedt knew this was another matter, and this question was later to figure prominently in the issue of whether to charge him with war crimes.

Barbarossa was initially scheduled for May, at the beginning of the Russian spring, but was postponed until June because unseasonably wet weather made the roads impassable for armour (not because of the German invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece in April, as is commonly supposed). Rundstedt moved his headquarters to Tarnów in south-eastern Poland. Since the dividing line between Army Group Centre and Army Group South was just south of Brest-Litovsk, he was in command of more than half of the total German-Soviet front. Sodenstern was again his chief of staff. Under his command were (from north to south) Reichenau (6th Army), Kleist (1st Panzer Army) and General Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel (17th Army). These three armies, bunched between Lublin and the Carpathians, were to thrust south-eastwards into Ukraine, aiming to capture Kiev and encircle and destroy the Soviet forces west of the Dnieper. In the south, General Eugen Ritter von Schobert (11th Army), supported by the Hungarian and Romanian armies, and also an Italian Army Corps, was to advance into Bessarabia (now Moldova) and the southern Ukraine. It&#x27;s unlikely that Rundstedt thought a decisive victory was possible at this point; while saying farewell to the commander of Army Group North in early May, he remarked: &quot;See you again in Siberia.&quot;

===Operation Barbarossa===
The attack began on 22 June. Despite ample warning from intelligence sources and defectors, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Command were caught by surprise, and the Germans rapidly broke through the frontier defences, helped by their total command of the air. But the Soviet commander in northern Ukraine, Colonel-General Mikhail Kirponos, was one of the better Soviet generals, and he commanded the Red Army&#x27;s largest and best-equipped force: nearly a million men and 4,800 tanks. The Germans soon encountered stubborn resistance. Rundstedt testified at Nuremberg: &quot;The resistance at the frontier was not too great, but it grew continually as we advanced into the interior of the country. Very strong tank forces, tanks of a better type, far superior to ours, appeared.&quot; The Soviet tank armies were in fact stronger than the German panzer divisions, and in the T-34 they possessed a superior tank: Kleist called it &quot;the finest tank in the world.&quot; Rundstedt said after the war: &quot;I realised soon after the attack that everything that had been written about Russia was wrong.&quot; But at this stage of the war the Red Army tank commanders lacked the tactical skill and experience of the German panzer commanders, and after ten days of bitter fighting Kleist&#x27;s armour broke through, reaching Zhitomir, only 130 km from Kiev, on 12 July. By 30 July the Red Army in Ukraine was in full retreat. Rundstedt and his commanders were confident that they could seize Kiev &quot;off the march,&quot; that is, without a prolonged siege.

Despite these successes, the campaign did not go according to plan. The front door was &quot;kicked in&quot;, but the Red Army was not destroyed, and the Soviet state did not collapse. Once this became apparent, at the end of July, Hitler and his commanders had to decide how to proceed. Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to pause at Smolensk, while the panzer divisions were shipped to the north and the south.

Although Rundstedt opposed this diversion of forces, he was its beneficiary as attention was shifted to the southern front. He also benefited from disastrous decisions made by the Soviets. On 10 July Stalin appointed his old crony Marshal Semyon Budyonny commander in Ukraine, with orders to stop the German advance at all costs. Budyonny ordered Kirponos to push his forces forwards to Kiev and Uman, despite the danger of encirclement, rather than withdraw and make a stand on the Dnieper. Rundstedt therefore decided to break off the advance towards Kiev, and to direct Kleist&#x27;s armour south-eastwards, towards Krivoy Rog. By 30 July the Germans were at Kirovograd, 130 km east of Uman, cutting off the Soviet line of retreat (which had in any case been forbidden by Stalin). Meanwhile, Schobert&#x27;s 11th Army was advancing north-eastwards from Bessarabia. On 2 August the two armies met, trapping over 100,000 Soviet troops, virtually all of whom were killed or captured. Southern Ukraine was thus left virtually defenceless, and by 25 August, when they entered Dniepropetrovsk, the Germans had occupied everything west of the Dnieper (except Odessa, which held out until October). Nevertheless, this had all taken longer than expected, and the Red Army was showing no signs of collapse. Rundstedt wrote to his wife on 12 August: &quot;How much longer? I have no great hope that it will be soon. The distances in Russia devour us.&quot;

Neither the success at Uman nor what followed at Kiev would have happened had Rundstedt not backed his subordinates and resisted Hitler&#x27;s interference in the conduct of the campaign. As during the French campaign, Hitler was panicked by his own success. By early July he was full of anxiety that the German armour was advancing too quickly, without infantry support, and that it was exposed to Soviet counter-attacks. On 10 July Brauchitsch arrived at Rundstedt&#x27;s headquarters at Brody, with instructions from Hitler that Kleist was turn south towards Vinnitsa and link up with Schobert&#x27;s army there, rather than continue south-east to Kirovograd. This would still have trapped many Soviet divisions, but it would have allowed the mass of Soviet forces at Uman and Kiev to escape. Rundstedt defended Kleist&#x27;s ability to execute the larger encirclement, and persuaded Brauchitsch that he was right. Brauchitsch then contacted Halder, who succeeded in persuading Hitler to support Rundstedt. This was a sign that Rundstedt still had Hitler&#x27;s respect, as were Hitler&#x27;s two visits to Rundstedt&#x27;s armies during this period.

After Uman Budyonny&#x27;s forces massed around Kiev – over 700,000 men – were left dangerously exposed, with Kleist&#x27;s 1st Panzer Army regrouping to the south-east and General Heinz Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Army (part of Army Group Centre) smashing General Yeromenko&#x27;s Briansk Front and advancing south from Gomel in White Russia, on a line well east of Kiev. The danger of encirclement was obvious, but Stalin stubbornly refused to consider withdrawal, despite warnings from both Budyonny and Kirponos that catastrophe was imminent. Budyonny has been freely blamed by postwar writers for the disaster at Kiev, but it is clear that while he was out of his depth as a front commander, he warned Stalin of the danger, and was dismissed for his pains. On 12 September Kleist crossed the Dnieper at Cherkasy heading north-east, and on 16 September his tanks linked up with Guderian&#x27;s at Lokhvitsa, nearly 200 km east of Kiev. Although many Soviet troops were able to escape eastwards in small groups, around 600,000 men – four whole armies comprising 43 divisions, nearly one-third of the Soviet Army&#x27;s strength at the start of the war – were killed or captured, and the great majority of those captured died in captivity. Kiev fell on 19 September. Kirponos was killed in action on 20 September, shortly before resistance ceased.

Rundstedt had thus presided over one of the greatest victories in the history of warfare. But this catastrophe for the Red Army resulted far more from the inflexibility of Stalin than it did from the talents of Rundstedt as a commander or the skill of the German Army. David Stahel, a recent historian of the Kiev campaign, wrote: &quot;Germany had been handed a triumph far in excess of what its exhausted armoured forces could have achieved without Stalin&#x27;s obduracy and incompetence.&quot; In fact both the German Army and the Red Army were driven more by the dictates of their respective political masters rather than by the decisions of the military professionals. Stahel sums the situation up with his chapter heading: &quot;Subordinating the generals: the dictators dictate.&quot; Kirponos could have withdrawn most of his army across the Dnieper in time had Stalin allowed him to do so, and Rundstedt himself acknowledged this. Had this happened, Rundstedt&#x27;s forces would have been in no state to give chase: they were exhausted after two months of ceaseless combat. Despite their successes, they had sustained high levels of casualties and even higher levels of loss of equipment, both of which were impossible to replace. By September the German Army in the Soviet Union had suffered nearly 500,000 casualties. In a statement to the Army on 15 August, Rundstedt acknowledged: &quot;It is only natural that such great effort would result in fatigue, the combat strength of the troops has weakened and in many places there is a desire for rest.&quot; But, said Rundstedt: &quot;We must keep pressure on the enemy for he has many more reserves than we.&quot; This was a remarkable admission so early in the Russian campaign, and it showed that Rundstedt was already well aware of how unrealistic the German belief in a quick victory had been.

Despite the monumental efforts and initial successes of Operation Barbarossa, by late 1941, the German advance began to falter significantly. Rundstedt’s forces, along with the rest of the Wehrmacht, faced an increasingly dire situation as they pushed deeper into Soviet territory. The logistical nightmare became more pronounced, with supply lines overextended and insufficient resources to maintain the pace of the advance. The harsh Russian winter arrived earlier than expected, bringing with it temperatures that plummeted to unprecedented lows, wreaking havoc on both men and machinery. German troops, unprepared for such extreme conditions, suffered from frostbite and hypothermia, severely impacting their combat effectiveness. Equipment and vehicles, not designed for sub-zero temperatures, frequently malfunctioned or were rendered inoperable. The Red Army, though battered, began to regroup and launch counteroffensives, exploiting the Germans&#x27; weakened state. Rundstedt, aware of the grim reality, acknowledged the growing resilience and capability of the Soviet forces. The campaign that was envisioned as a quick, decisive victory was now evolving into a drawn-out war of attrition, with the Germans struggling to maintain their foothold against a resurgent and determined enemy. This shift marked the beginning of a protracted and brutal conflict that would eventually drain the German war effort and contribute to the ultimate downfall of the Third Reich.

===Dismissal===
Despite the triumph at Kiev, by the end of September Rundstedt was becoming concerned about the state of his command. After three months of continuous fighting, the German armies were exhausted, and the Panzer divisions were in urgent need of new equipment as a result of losses in battle and damage from the poorly-paved Ukrainian roads. As autumn set in, the weather deteriorated, making the situation worse. Rundstedt wanted to halt on the Dnieper for the winter, which would allow the German Army time to rest and be re-equipped. But the German armies could not rest, for fear the Soviet southern armies (now commanded by the stubborn Marshal Semyon Timoshenko) would regroup and consolidate a front on the Donets or the Don. So, soon after the fall of Kiev, the offensive was resumed. Reichenau advanced east towards Kharkov and Kleist and Stülpnagel headed south-east towards the lower Donets. In the south 11th Army and the Romanians (commanded by Manstein following the death of Schobert) advanced along the Sea of Azov coast towards Rostov.

The Soviet armies were in a poor state after the catastrophes of Uman and Kiev, and could offer only sporadic resistance, but the German advance was slowed by the autumn rains and the Soviet scorched earth policy, which denied the Germans food and fuel and forced them to rely on overstretched lines of supply. Rundstedt&#x27;s armies were also weakened by the transfer of units back to Army Group Centre to take part in the attack on Moscow (Operation Typhoon). Reichenau did not take Kharkov until 24 October. Nevertheless, during October Rundstedt&#x27;s forces won another great victory when Manstein and Kleist&#x27;s tanks reached the Sea of Azov, trapping two Soviet Armies around Mariupol and taking over 100,000 prisoners. This victory enabled Manstein to undertake the conquest of the Crimea (apart from the fortress city of Sevastopol) against only weak opposition, while Kleist advanced towards Rostov. Despite these defeats, the Red Army was able to fall back on the Don in reasonably good order, and also to evacuate many of the industrial plants of the Donbass.

On 3 November Brauchitsch visited Rundstedt&#x27;s headquarters at Poltava, where Rundstedt told him that the armies must halt and dig in for the winter. But Hitler drove his commanders on, insisting on an advance to the Volga and into the North Caucasus, to seize the oilfields at Maikop. These demands put Rundstedt under severe strain. The Germans were more than 300 km from Maikop and 500 km from the Volga at Stalingrad. On the other hand, they were over 1,000 km from their starting point in eastern Poland, and even further from their supply bases in Germany. The Russian winter set in with full force in mid-November. The Germans were short of food, fuel, ammunition, vehicles, spare parts and winter clothing. Partisan activity was growing in their rear areas, threatening their supplies. Rundstedt was now 65 and not in good health – he was a heavy smoker, and in October in Poltava he suffered a mild heart attack. He increasingly resorted to drink to cope with the strain. He was now in the position of having to launch a new offensive against his better judgement, with exhausted troops in very adverse conditions. This was a recipe for defeat, but Rundstedt obeyed Hitler&#x27;s orders.

Kleist, his units reinforced by Waffen-SS General Sepp Dietrich&#x27;s 1st SS Division (the ), attacked on 17 November, and captured Rostov on the 21st. But the Soviets had had time to prepare, and launched a counter-offensive on the 25th. On the 28th Rundstedt authorised Kleist to withdraw from Rostov and establish a front on the Mius, 70 km to the west. When Hitler heard of this the next day, he ordered that Rostov should be held, although it had in fact already been evacuated. Rundstedt replied by insisting on his decision, and adding: &quot;Should confidence in my leadership no longer exist, I beg to request someone be substituted who enjoys the necessary confidence of the Supreme Command.&quot; Hitler took Rundstedt at his word, and on 1 December he dismissed him, replacing him with Reichenau. The new commander saw at once that Rundstedt was right, and succeeded in persuading Hitler, via Halder, to authorise the withdrawal. This was the first significant defeat the German Army suffered in World War II, and Rundstedt was the first senior commander to be dismissed.

Hitler, however, immediately realised that he had gone too far in arbitrarily sacking the most senior commander of the German Army. He arrived in Poltava on 3 December, where he found both Reichenau and Sepp Dietrich firm in defending the correctness of Rundstedt&#x27;s actions. Sodenstern explained the full circumstances of the retreat from Rostov to Hitler, an explanation which Hitler grudgingly accepted. Hitler then met with Rundstedt and excused himself on the grounds that it had all been a misunderstanding. He suggested that Rundstedt take a period of leave, &quot;and then once more place your incomparable services at my disposal.&quot; On 5 December, his honour restored, Rundstedt left Poltava, never to return to the Russian front.

Shortly after his return to Kassel, on his 66th birthday, Rundstedt received a cheque from Hitler for 250,000 Reichsmarks. This was part of Hitler&#x27;s policy of buying the continuing loyalty of his senior commanders. Many found this offensive, but none turned down these gifts. Rundstedt tried to do the next best thing by failing to cash the cheque. By February this was attracting adverse comment in Berlin, and Rundstedt then cashed it. Some writers have sought to connect Rundstedt&#x27;s acceptance of this money with his continuing refusal to support the resistance movement against Hitler&#x27;s regime within the German Army. In fact Rundstedt refused to have anything to do with the money, handing it over to his daughter-in-law, and it was still untouched at his death in 1953.

===War crimes in the East===

In April 1941, during the planning phase of Barbarossa, Himmler and Brauchitsch had agreed that as the Army conquered Soviet territory, it would be handed over at once to the SS and the German Police, now fused under Himmler&#x27;s leadership in the HSSPF (Higher SS and Police Leadership). Himmler set up four under the overall command of Reinhard Heydrich. In Rundstedt&#x27;s area of command, C, commanded by Otto Rasch, operated in northern Ukraine, and D, commanded by Otto Ohlendorf, operated in southern Ukraine.

The were initially ordered to establish &quot;security&quot; in the rear areas by killing communists and partisans, but by 1941 the identity between Jews and communism was strongly established in the minds of most SS men and Police officers. In July Himmler told an SS gathering: &quot;This nation [Russia] has been united by the Jews in a religion, a world-view, called Bolshevism.&quot; From the beginning, therefore, the mostly killed Jews: initially only adult males, but after a few months indiscriminately. By December 1941, when Rundstedt was dismissed as commander of Army Group South, C and D had killed between 100,000 and 150,000 people. In addition, various units participated in killing 33,000 Kiev Jews at Babi Yar in September 1941, only days after the city was occupied by the Army.

The Army did participate directly in these mass killings: officers of Reichenau&#x27;s 6th Army took part in organising the massacre at Babi Yar. On 10 October he issued an order (known as the &quot;Reichenau Order&quot;) headed &quot;Conduct of the Troops in the East&quot;, in which he said: &quot;The primary goal of the campaign against the Jewish-Bolshevist system is the absolute destruction of the means of power and the eradication of the Asian influence in the European cultural sphere ... Therefore, the soldier must have full understanding of the necessity of hard but just atonement of Jewish subhumanity [].&quot; Two days later Rundstedt circulated it to all his senior commanders, with the comment: &quot;I thoroughly concur with its contents.&quot; He urged them to release their own versions and to impress upon their troops the need to exterminate the Jews.

Since Reichenau&#x27;s order was widely understood as endorsing the mass killings of Ukrainian Jews which were going on behind the German lines, with which 6th Army at any rate was actively co-operating, Rundstedt&#x27;s open endorsement of its strongly anti-Semitic language clearly contradicts his later assertions that he did not know what the were doing. He told interrogators in 1946 that he was aware of just one atrocity, at Berdichev on 30 July. At Nuremberg he sought to portray the issue in terms of anti-partisan warfare: &quot;Disorderly, irregular warfare behind the front of the Army must bring very great misery to the population of the country affected. No army in the world can tolerate such conditions for any length of time, but in the interests of the security and protection of its own troops it must take sharp, energetic measures. But this should, of course, be done in a correct and soldierly manner.&quot; Rundstedt shared the general German Army prejudice against the (Eastern Jews) found in the Soviet Union. He described Zamość as &quot;a dirty Jewish hole.&quot;

In September 1941 Rundstedt issued an order that soldiers were not to participate in or take photos of &quot;Jewish operations&quot;, indicating awareness of their existence. The killings took place with the knowledge and support of the German Army in the east.

Under Rundstedt&#x27;s command, Army Group South actively participated in the policies outlined in the Hunger Plan, the Nazi racial starvation policy, by &quot;living off the land&quot; and denying food supplies to Soviet prisoners of war and civilians. German troops &quot;plundered huge quantities of livestock, grain and dairy produce&quot;, enough to feed themselves and to create substantial reserves for the Reich. However, due to transportation problems, the supplies could not be shipped to Germany and much of them spoiled during the winter of 1941/1942. As a consequence, mass starvation set in within urban areas, especially in Kiev and Kharkov.

===Command in the West===
In March 1942 Hitler re-appointed Rundstedt OB West, in succession to Witzleben, who was ill. He returned to the comfortable headquarters in the Hotel Pavillon Henri IV in Saint-Germain, which he had occupied in 1940–41. Rundstedt&#x27;s command of French and his good relationship with the head of the collaborationist Vichy regime, Marshal Philippe Pétain, were considerable assets. But his position was to grow increasingly difficult. Hitler did not intend giving him real authority, seeing him as a dignified figurehead. Although he was commander of the German Army in the west, charged with defending the coasts of France and Belgium against attack by the western Allies, the military governors in Paris and Brussels (Rundstedt&#x27;s former subordinate Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel and Alexander von Falkenhausen respectively) were not under his direct command, and he had no control over the Navy or Air Force. He also had no control over the SS and Gestapo operations in France: the HSSPF in Paris, Carl Oberg, answered only to Himmler.

Secondly, the internal situation in France had changed greatly since Rundstedt&#x27;s departure in March 1941. Hitler&#x27;s attack on the Soviet Union had led the French Communist Party to abandon its previous neutrality (its slogan was &quot;Neither Pétain nor de Gaulle&quot;), and launch active resistance against the Germans and the Vichy regime. The result was an escalating cycle of assassinations and reprisal killings that rapidly alienated the hitherto quiescent French population. On 20 October French Communists assassinated the German commander in Nantes, Karl Hotz, triggering the execution of over 100 French hostages. As military governor, Stülpnagel directed the policy of executing hostages. Rundstedt had no direct control over the Army&#x27;s response to Resistance attacks. Nevertheless, many held him responsible, then and later.

Rundstedt had more direct responsibility for the Commando Order of 1942, which later served as the basis of war crimes charges against him. There were in fact two German orders concerning captured Allied commandos. The first was issued by Rundstedt in July 1942, and stated that captured Allied parachutists were to be handed over to the Gestapo, , rather than made prisoners of war. This was a response to the increasing number of British agents being parachuted into France by the Special Operations Executive. The second was issued by Hitler personally in October, following the Dieppe Raid by the British and Canadians on the coast of France. It stipulated that all captured Allied commandos were to be executed, again regardless of whether they were in uniform. As a consequence, six British commandos captured in Operation Frankton, a raid on shipping at Bordeaux in December 1942, were executed by the German Navy. Although Rundstedt neither ordered nor was informed of this action, he was later held responsible as German commander in France.

Meanwhile, the military situation for the Germans was deteriorating. The entry of the United States into the war in December 1941 raised the likelihood of an Allied invasion of France. Hitler&#x27;s response was to order the construction of the Atlantic Wall, a system of coastal fortifications from Norway to the French-Spanish border, to be constructed by the Organisation Todt using slave labour. There was also a steady build-up of German forces in France, despite the demands of the eastern front. By June Rundstedt commanded 25 divisions. In November 1942 the Allies invaded French North Africa (Operation Torch). When the Vichy authorities in Africa surrendered after token resistance, the Germans responded by occupying all of France and dissolving what remained of the French Army. Rundstedt travelled to Vichy to placate Pétain, who threatened to resign but backed down after soothing words from Rundstedt. At the same time, in the Soviet Union, Rundstedt&#x27;s old command, Army Group South, was facing disaster at Stalingrad, the turning point of World War II in Europe.

The catastrophe of Stalingrad prompted renewed efforts by dissident German officers to remove Hitler from power while there was still time, as they believed, to negotiate an honourable peace settlement. The conspirators were centered on Halder, Beck and Witzleben, but by 1943 all had been removed from positions of authority. The real movers were now more junior officers: Henning von Tresckow, chief of staff of Army Group Centre, Friedrich Olbricht, Chief of the Armed Forces Replacement Office, and Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, a member of the Replacement Army staff. Their strategy at this time was to persuade the senior field commanders to lead a coup against Hitler. Their initial target was Manstein, now commanding Army Group Don, but he turned Tresckow down at a meeting in March 1943. Several sources say that Rundstedt was also approached, although they do not say specifically who approached him. In any case, he refused to get involved, although both Stülpnagel and Falkenhausen were recruits to the conspiracy. By one account, he complained: &quot;Why always me? Let Manstein and Kluge do it.&quot; He told Gerhard Engel, one of Hitler&#x27;s adjutants, that he was &quot;too old and had had enough.&quot;

It was true, however, that Rundstedt was well past his best. The military historian Chester Wilmot wrote soon after the war: &quot;The truth was that Rundstedt had lost his grip. He was old and tired and his once active brain was gradually becoming addled, for he had great difficulty in sleeping without the soporific aid of alcohol.&quot; Events in June 1944 showed that this was an exaggeration: Rundstedt was still capable of clear thought and decisive action. But his health was a matter of increasing concern to his staff and his family. His son Leutnant Hans-Gerd von Rundstedt was posted to his command as an aide-de-camp, partly to monitor his health and report back to Bila in Kassel. In one of his letters, Hans-Gerd referred to his father&#x27;s &quot;somewhat plentiful nicotine and alcohol consumption,&quot; but assured his mother that Rundstedt&#x27;s health was basically sound. Nevertheless, in May 1943 Rundstedt was given leave and was sent to a sanatorium at Bad Tölz, south of Munich, which was also the site of an SS-Junker school. Later he stayed some time at Grundlsee in Austria, and was received by Hitler at his summer house at Berchtesgaden, a sign of Hitler&#x27;s continuing respect for him. He was back at work by July.

===Defeat in Normandy===
The Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943 removed Rundstedt&#x27;s fears that France would be invaded that summer, but he could not have doubted that the massive build-up of American troops in Britain meant that a cross-channel invasion would come in 1944. In October Rundstedt sent Hitler a memorandum on the defensive preparations. He placed no faith in the Atlantic Wall, seeing it merely as useful propaganda. He said: &quot;We Germans, do not indulge in the tired Maginot spirit.&quot; He argued that an invasion could only be defeated by a defence in depth, with armoured reserves positioned well inland so that they could be deployed to wherever the invasion came, and launch counter-offensives to drive the invaders back. There were several problems with this, particularly the lack of fuel for rapid movements of armour, the Allied air superiority which enabled them to disrupt the transport system, and the increasingly effective sabotage efforts of the French resistance. Hitler was not persuaded: his view was that the invasion must be defeated on the beaches. Characteristically, however, he told Rundstedt he agreed with him, then sent Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to France with orders to hasten the completion of the Atlantic Wall; while Rundstedt remained the commander in France, Rommel became the official commander of Army Group B. Rundstedt was extremely angered by this decision; although he admired Rommel&#x27;s tactical skill, he knew from his colleagues that Rommel was notoriously difficult to work with and would mostly be able to ignore Rundstedt&#x27;s authority thanks to his patronage by Hitler and Goebbels. Rommel in fact agreed with Rundstedt that the Atlantic Wall was a &quot;gigantic bluff&quot;, but he also believed that Allied air power made Rundstedt&#x27;s proposed defense plan impossible; like Hitler, he believed the invasion could only be stopped on the beach itself.

By the spring of 1944 Rommel had turned the mostly nonexistent &#x27;Wall&#x27; into a formidable defensive line, but since he believed the invasion would come somewhere between Dunkirk and the mouth of the Somme, much of his work was directed at strengthening the wrong area, although in late 1943 he had focused on Normandy. As fears of an imminent invasion mounted, conflict broke out among the commanders. Rommel wanted the armoured divisions positioned close to the coast, mostly in the area he considered at highest risk. The commander of armoured forces in France, General Leo Freiherr Geyr von Schweppenburg, backed by Rundstedt, strongly disagreed, wanting his forces to be positioned inland to preserve their manoeuvrability. Eventually Hitler intervened, imposing a compromise: half the armour would be allocated to the Army Groups defending the beaches, and half would be kept in reserve under Geyr von Schweppenburg; the latter, however, were not to be deployed without Hitler&#x27;s direct order. Hitler made matters worse by appointing Rommel commander of Army Group B, covering all of northern France. This unworkable command structure was to have dire consequences when the invasion came.

The invasion duly came before dawn on 6 June 1944, in Normandy, far to the west of the sector where Rundstedt and Rommel had expected it. Rommel was on leave in Germany, many of the local commanders in Normandy were at a conference in Rennes, and Hitler was asleep at Berchtesgaden. But Rundstedt, now 68, was up before 03:00, trying to take charge of a confusing situation. He immediately saw that the reported Allied airborne landings in Normandy presaged a seaborne invasion. He contacted OKW and demanded that he be given authority to deploy the armoured reserves, but OKW could not agree to this without Hitler&#x27;s approval. Hitler&#x27;s refusal came through at 10:00, followed by his change of mind at 14:30, by which time the Allies were well ashore and the cloud cover had lifted, preventing the armour from moving until dusk. In mid-afternoon Rundstedt ordered that &quot;the Allies [be] wiped out before the day&#x27;s end, otherwise the enemy would reinforce and the chance would be lost&quot;, but it was too late. Rundstedt&#x27;s biographer concludes: &quot;If Hitler had released the Panzer reserves as soon as Rundstedt had asked for them, the Allies would have experienced a much harder day on 6 June than they did.&quot; The historian Stephen E. Ambrose wrote: &quot;The only high-command officer who responded correctly to the crisis at hand was Field Marshal Rundstedt, the old man who was there for window-dressing and who was so scorned by Hitler and OKW ... Rundstedt&#x27;s reasoning was sound, his actions decisive, his orders clear.&quot;

Being right was little consolation to Rundstedt. By 11 June it was evident that the Allies could not be dislodged from their beach-head in Normandy. Their total command of the air and the sabotage of roads and bridges by the Resistance made bringing armoured reinforcements to Normandy slow and difficult, but without them there was no hope of an effective counter-offensive. Supported by Rommel, he tried to persuade Keitel at OKW that the only escape was to withdraw from Normandy to a prepared defensive line on the Seine, but Hitler forbade any withdrawal. On 17 June Hitler flew to France and met Rundstedt and Rommel at his command bunker near Soissons. Both Field Marshals argued that the situation in Normandy required either massive reinforcements (which were not available) or a rapid withdrawal. Remarkably, they both also urged that Hitler find a political solution to end the war, which Rommel told him bluntly was unwinnable. Hitler ignored all their demands, requiring &quot;fanatical&quot; defence and a counter-attack with whatever was available. Rommel warned Hitler about the inevitable collapse in the German defences, but was rebuffed and told to focus on military operations.

It was during the desperate German attempts to bring reserve units to the front that men of the SS Panzer Division destroyed the village of Oradour-sur-Glane in central France, in retaliation for partisan attacks in the area. Rundstedt was German commander-in-chief in France, had ordered to head north to Normandy, and had previously condoned tough action against partisans who had killed or tortured German officers or personnel, including the shooting of hostages. This was enough for the French government to demand after the war that he stand trial for the massacre at Oradour.

On 29 June Rundstedt and Rommel were summoned to Berchtesgaden for a further meeting with Hitler, at which they repeated their demands, and were again rebuffed. On his return to Saint-Germain, on 30 June, Rundstedt found an urgent plea from Schweppenburg, who was commanding the armoured force at Caen, to be allowed to withdraw his units out of range of Allied naval gunfire, which was decimating his forces. Rundstedt at once agreed, and notified OKW of this decision. On 1 July he received a message from OKW countermanding his orders. In a fury, he phoned Keitel, urging him to go to Hitler and get the decision reversed. Keitel pleaded that this was impossible. &quot;What shall we do?&quot; he asked. Rundstedt is said to have replied &quot; (one version of the story as told by Blumentritt did not include the &quot;). This literally means &quot;End the war, you idiots!&quot;, but has commonly been reported in English-language accounts as &quot;Make peace, you idiots!&quot; There has been some doubt raised as to whether Rundstedt actually said this, but Wilmot says the incident was recounted to him and Liddell Hart by Blumentritt, who was present.

Keitel conveyed to Hitler that Rundstedt felt unable to cope with the increased demands, and Hitler relieved him of his command, replacing him with Kluge. It is likely that Hitler had already decided that Rundstedt should be replaced after the meetings of 17 and 29 June. It was officially given out that Rundstedt was retiring on the grounds of age and ill-health. Hitler wrote him a &quot;very cordial&quot; letter, and awarded him the Oak Leaves to his Knight&#x27;s Cross, one of the highest of the new decorations created in 1940. Rundstedt departed Saint-Germain for the last time on 4 July, accompanied by his son, and was driven back to the sanatorium at Bad Tölz, to be reunited with his wife. He told Rommel on departing that he would never hold another military command.

===Plot to kill Hitler===
Rundstedt had resisted all attempts to recruit him to the various conspiracies against Hitler that had been operating inside the German Army since 1938. Although he had not denounced or reported any of the officers who had approached him, he had shown no sympathy with their appeals. By June 1944 the conspirators had given up on him (and indeed on all the senior field commanders), so he was not approached by the group around Tresckow and Stauffenberg who hatched the unsuccessful plot to kill Hitler with a bomb at the Wolf&#x27;s Lair (), his headquarters in East Prussia, and had no inkling of what was planned. When he heard of the attempt on 20 July, his reaction was very hostile. A year later, in June 1945, he told the investigating commission preparing for the Nuremberg Trials: &quot;I would never have thought of such a thing, that would have been base, bare-faced treachery.&quot; Since he had every reason to try to put himself in a sympathetic light at Nuremberg, this certainly reflects his view in June 1944. He also argued, however, that the attempt to kill Hitler was pointless, because the German Army and people would not have followed the conspirators. &quot;The Army and also the people still believed in Hitler at that time, and such an overthrow would have been quite unsuccessful.&quot; He reiterated his traditional sense of his duty as a soldier: had he supported the plot, he said, &quot;I would have emerged and been considered for all time the greatest traitor to my Fatherland.&quot;

Officers like Rundstedt who argued that a coup against Hitler would not have won support in the Army or among the German people were, in the view of most historians, correct. Joachim Fest, writing of Tresckow, said: &quot;Even officers who were absolutely determined to stage a coup were troubled by the fact that everything they were contemplating would inevitably be seen by their troops as dereliction of duty, as irresponsible arrogance, and, worst, as capable of triggering a civil war.&quot; On the attitude of the people, Fest wrote: &quot;Most industrial workers remained loyal to the regime, even as the war ground on.&quot;

Rundstedt was thus above suspicion of involvement in the 20 July plot, but he could not escape entanglement in its bloody aftermath. A large number of senior officers were directly or indirectly implicated, headed by Field Marshals Kluge, Rommel (very peripherally) and Witzleben, and Generals Falkenhausen, Erich Fellgiebel, Friedrich Fromm, Paul von Hase, Gustav Heistermann von Ziehlberg, Otto Herfurth, Erich Hoepner, Fritz Lindemann, Friedrich von Rabenau, Hans Speidel, Helmuth Stieff, Stülpnagel, Fritz Thiele, Georg Thomas and Eduard Wagner, as well as Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. Many of these would have been known personally to Rundstedt. Witzleben was an old colleague, and Stülpnagel had been his subordinate in Ukraine and his colleague in France. These considerations do not seem to have influenced his conduct at all.

Hitler was determined not only to punish those involved in the plot, but to break the power, status, and cohesion of the Prussian officer corps once and for all. Since traditionally German officers could not be tried by civilian courts, he decided that the Army must expel all those accused of involvement. They could then be tried before the People&#x27;s Court (), a special court established in 1934 to try political crimes and presided over by the fanatical Nazi Roland Freisler. Hitler therefore ordered the convening of a &quot;Court of Honour&quot; () to carry out the expulsions, and appointed Rundstedt to head it. The other senior members were Generals Keitel and Guderian, Walther Schroth, and Karl-Wilhelm Specht. This court considered only evidence placed before it by the Gestapo. No defence counsel was permitted, and none of the accused was allowed to appear. On this basis, several officers were expelled from the Army, while others were exonerated. Among those the court declined to expel were Halder (who had no involvement in the plot), and Hans Speidel, Rommel&#x27;s chief of Staff (who was deeply implicated). Those expelled appeared in batches before the People&#x27;s Court, where after perfunctory trials most of them were executed by hanging. Rundstedt and Heinz Guderian have been singled out as the two who most contributed to Rommel&#x27;s expulsion from the army, especially as both had good reason to dislike him; however, Rommel and Rundstedt had always had a grudging respect for one another, and Rundstedt later served as Hitler&#x27;s representative at Rommel&#x27;s state funeral in Ulm.

No incident in Rundstedt&#x27;s career has damaged his posthumous reputation as much as his involvement in this process. John Wheeler-Bennett wrote in 1967: &quot;To such a nadir of supine degradation had come the child of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and Moltke.&quot; He called the Court &quot;the final farce of casuistry&quot; and accused the officer corps of washing its hands, Pilate-like, of their comrades. Rundstedt&#x27;s biographer writes: &quot;This was something for which some Germans, while they were prepared to forgive him everything else, could and cannot excuse him.&quot; Speidel, despite the fact that he was spared, was bitterly critical of Rundstedt after the war, when he became a senior officer in the new West German Army. Blumentritt, always loyal to his old , complained in 1953: &quot;He has had to endure vindictiveness and jealousy even up to and after the hour of his death.&quot;

===Return to the West===
The aftermath of the 20 July plot coincided with the rout of the German armies in both the east and the west. In the east Operation Bagration destroyed Army Group Centre and drove the Germans out of Byelorussia and eastern Poland: they were also forced out of the Balkans. In the west, the Americans, British and Canadians broke out of the Normandy pocket and swept across France, taking Paris on 25 August and Brussels on 3 September. The German command in the west was reorganised following the suicide of Kluge, the arrest of Stülpnagel and the incapacitation of Rommel. Field Marshal Walter Model, known as &quot;the Führer&#x27;s fireman&quot; for his reputation for stabilising dangerous situations, was appointed both OB West and commander of Army Group B on 16 August, but even he could not do justice to both jobs. At Blumentritt&#x27;s urgent request, supported by Model, Hitler agreed to ask Rundstedt to resume his post as OB West, which at a meeting on 1 September he agreed to do, saying &quot;My Führer, whatever you order, I shall do to my last breath.&quot;

The appointment of Rundstedt was at least in part a propaganda exercise. He was the most senior and one of the best known German Army commanders, both in Germany and abroad. His formidable reputation inspired confidence at home and trepidation among the enemy. His appointment was designed to impress the Allies, reassure the German people, and bolster the morale of the officer corps after the shock of 20 July and the subsequent purge. The Allies believed Rundstedt to be a far more powerful and influential figure than he in fact was, regarding him with &quot;respect, almost awe&quot; as the master strategist of the German Army – something he would not find helpful after the war. He had already appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in August 1942, and did so again in August 1944, when it was suggested, quite wrongly, that he was behind the 20 July plot. There were even suggestions that he would take over leadership of the German state. But Hitler saw Rundstedt as a figurehead: he intended that operational control on the western front remain with the energetic and ruthless Model, a committed Nazi. Rundstedt, on the other hand, saw himself as the voice of experience, restraining the younger Model, whom he described as &quot;courageous but impulsive.&quot;

With the comforts of Saint-Germain no longer available, Rundstedt established his headquarters near Koblenz. His chief of staff was now the capable General Siegfried Westphal. Under Rundstedt was Model, commanding Army Group B and facing the British and Canadians as they advanced through Belgium and into the Netherlands, and the Americans as they advanced into the Ardennes in southern Belgium and Luxembourg. Further south, Army Group G, commanded by General Hermann Balck, faced the Americans in Lorraine and Alsace, down to the Swiss border. In October, Army Group H in the north was split off from Model&#x27;s very extended front, and was placed under the command of the paratroop general Kurt Student.

Rundstedt believed even at this stage that an effective defensive line could only be established on the Rhine, but this would have meant giving up large areas of German territory, and Hitler would not countenance it. He insisted that a stand be made on the West Wall (known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line), a defensive system built along Germany&#x27;s western frontiers in 1938–40, but partly dismantled in 1943–44 to provide materials for the Atlantic Wall. Model told OKW that this would require 25 divisions of fresh troops, but these were no longer to be had. Instead the line was held by patched-up divisions escaping from the debacle in France, and &quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; divisions made up from transferred Navy and Air Force personnel, older men and teenagers: these units were fit for static defence, but not much else.

Nevertheless, the Germans now had certain advantages. In military terms, it is easier to defend a fixed line than it is to take one by storm. They were now fighting in defence of their own frontiers, and this stiffened resolve. They no longer had to deal with partisans sabotaging their supply lines, and they were close to their own sources of supply in Germany. The Allies on the other hand had severe logistical problems, with their supply lines running all the way back to the Normandy beaches. The great port of Antwerp was in their hands, but the Germans still controlled the mouth of the Scheldt, so the Allies could not use it as a supply port. In September the American tank armies in Lorraine literally ran out of fuel, and during October the Allied offensive gradually lost momentum and came to a halt on a line well west of the German border in most sectors, although the frontier city of Aachen fell on 21 October. With the failure of the British attempt to force a crossing of the Rhine at Arnhem (Operation Market Garden) in late September, the chance of invading Germany before the winter set in was lost, and Rundstedt was given time to consolidate his position.

===Ardennes Offensive===
Hitler, however, had no intention of staying on the defensive in the west over the winter. As early as mid-September he was planning a counter-offensive. By October, with the front stabilising, he had decided on an attack in the Ardennes, designed to split the British and American fronts at a weakly held point, cross the Meuse and recapture Antwerp. On 27 October Rundstedt and Model met with General Alfred Jodl, chief of operations at OKW, and told him flatly that they considered this impossible with the available forces. Instead they suggested a more modest operation to destroy the Allied concentrations around Liège and Aachen. Jodl took their views back to Hitler, but on 3 November he told them that the Führer&#x27;s mind was made up, and that he wanted the attack to begin before the end of November. The spearhead was to be the 6th Panzer Army, commanded by Sepp Dietrich and largely made up of Waffen-SS units such as the , and , and the 5th Panzer Army, commanded by General Hasso von Manteuffel.

Model persuaded Jodl that the deadline was unrealistic, and on 2 December he and Westphal went to Berlin to argue their case with Hitler. Rundstedt refused to go, because, he said, he hated listening to Hitler&#x27;s monologues. This marked his effective abdication as a military leader: he was now only a figurehead, and apparently content to be so. After the war he disowned all responsibility for the offensive: &quot;If old von Moltke thought that I had planned that offensive he would have turned over in his grave.&quot; Hitler arrived on the western front on 10 December to supervise the offensive, which was now set for 16 December. He gave orders directly to the army commanders, bypassing both Rundstedt and Model. Manteuffel said: &quot;The plan for the Ardennes offensive was drawn up completely by OKW and sent to us as a cut-and-dried Führer order.&quot;

Taking advantage of surprise and poor weather (which helped neutralise the Allies&#x27; command of the air), the offensive made initial progress, breaking through the weak American formations in this quiet sector of the front. But the Allies were quick to react, and the Germans were soon falling behind their ambitious timetables. To the north, Dietrich&#x27;s 6th Panzer Army was blocked by stubborn defence at St. Vith and Elsenborn Ridge and advanced little more than 20 km. Manteuffel, in the centre, did better, reaching Celles, a few kilometres short of the Meuse, on 25 December. This was a penetration of about 80 km, less than halfway to Antwerp, and on such a narrow front as to create an indefensible salient. The resistance of the American garrison at Bastogne greatly delayed the advance, making a forcing of the Meuse impossible. When the cloud cover lifted on 24 December, the Allied air forces attacked with devastating effect. Rundstedt urged OKW to halt the offensive, lest the &quot;bulge&quot; created by the German advance become a &quot;second Stalingrad&quot;, but Hitler was determined to press on. A few days later U.S. forces attacked from the north and south of the bulge, forcing the Germans first to halt and then to retreat.

Waffen-SS units under Rundstedt&#x27;s overall command committed war crimes during the campaign in the West, including the Malmedy massacre, which was perpetrated by troops under the command of Joachim Peiper. His unit of the SS division was under the command of Wilhelm Mohnke. Peiper&#x27;s battle group () was charged with seizing the bridges over the Meuse ahead of the advance of the 6th Panzer Army. On 17 December, near Malmedy, a group of Peiper&#x27;s men, opened fire on a large group of unarmed U.S. prisoners of war, killing 84. Responsibility for this crime ran from Peiper to Mohnke to Dietrich to Model to Rundstedt, although none of them had been present and none had ordered such action. When Rundstedt heard about it, he ordered an investigation, but in the chaos of the failing offensive nothing came of this.

Although such occurrences were commonplace on the Eastern Front from both sides, they were a rarity in the West, and the outraged Americans were determined to prosecute all those with responsibility for this massacre. Here Rundstedt&#x27;s problem was his reputation. The Ardennes offensive was known to the Allies as &quot;the Rundstedt offensive&quot;, and the Allied press routinely described him as being in charge of it. The British commander in Europe, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, said on 7 January 1945: &quot;I used to think that Rommel was good, but my opinion is that Rundstedt would have hit him for six. Rundstedt is the best German general I have come up against.&quot; Since Rundstedt, as far as the Allies knew, was in charge of the offensive, it followed for them that he was responsible for what his subordinates did during it.

===Defence of the Rhine===
On 8 January, Hitler authorised Manteuffel to withdraw from the tip of the bulge, and on 15 January he gave up the whole enterprise and returned to Berlin. By the end of January the Germans were back where they had started. But the offensive had burned up the last of Rundstedt&#x27;s reserves of manpower, equipment and fuel, and as a result neither the West Wall nor the Rhine could be properly defended. On 18 February, as the Allies entered Germany, Rundstedt issued an appeal to the German Army to resist the invader, urging the troops to &quot;gather round the Führer to guard our people and our state from a destiny of horror.&quot; Hitler rewarded his loyalty with the Swords to his Knight&#x27;s Cross. Despite fierce resistance in places, the Germans were forced back from the West Wall during February, and a series of Allied offensives, rolling from north to south, drove across the Rhineland towards the great river. On 2 March the Americans reached the Rhine near Düsseldorf. Rundstedt had been aware as early as September of the importance of the many bridges over the Rhine, and of the necessity of denying them to the enemy. He made careful plans for the bridges to be blown up if the enemy reached the Rhine. On 7 March, however, these plans failed when the Americans captured the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen intact, and rapidly established a bridgehead on the eastern bank. This could hardly be blamed on Rundstedt, but he was the commander and Hitler needed a scapegoat.

===Relief of command===
On 9 March Hitler phoned Rundstedt and told him he was to be replaced by Albert Kesselring, to be transferred from Italy. That was the end of Gerd von Rundstedt&#x27;s military career after 52 years.

On 11 March Rundstedt had a final audience with Hitler, who thanked him for his loyalty. He then returned to his home in Kassel, but bombing and the Allied advance into western Germany made him decide to move his family, first to Solz, a village south of Kassel, then to Weimar, then to Bayreuth, and finally back to the sanatorium at Bad Tölz where he had stayed several times before. Rundstedt&#x27;s heart condition had worsened and he also suffered from arthritis. There was no attempt at further escape: Rundstedt, accompanied by Bila and Hans Gerd and a few staff, stayed at Bad Tölz until it was occupied by American forces on 1 May, the day after Hitler&#x27;s suicide in Berlin. That evening he was made a prisoner of war by troops from the 36th Infantry Division.

Rundstedt complained publicly several times during and after the war: &quot;Without Hitler&#x27;s consent, I can&#x27;t even move my own sentry from my front door around to the back!&quot; Privately with other generals he referred to Hitler as that Bohemian corporal. Wilhelm Keitel once asked Hitler &quot;Do you realise that Rundstedt called you a Bohemian corporal?&quot; and Hitler replied &quot;Yes, but he&#x27;s the best field marshal I have.&quot;

==Post-war==
===In custody===
 Rundstedt was initially held at the Allied facility for detaining high-ranking German officials, known as ASHCAN, in a hotel at Mondorf-les-Bains in Luxembourg. Out of consideration for his rank and state of health, Hans Gerd was allowed to accompany him. At the end of May they were moved to an American detention centre at Wiesbaden. Here Rundstedt was extensively questioned by U.S. Army interrogators about his career and actions during the war. During this period decisions were being made about which German leaders were to be put on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials. Rundstedt was the most senior German officer in Allied custody. He was accused of responsibility for war crimes in Poland (the shooting of surrendered soldiers in 1939), the Soviet Union (the actions of the in 1941), Britain (the Commando Order of 1942) and France (the Oradour massacre of 1944). Eventually the International Military Tribunal (IMT) decided that no German field commanders would be tried at Nuremberg. Instead &quot;the General Staff and High Command of the German Armed Forces&quot; was collectively indicted. The only Army officers individually indicted were the OKW chiefs Keitel and Jodl, but they had never been field commanders.

In July Rundstedt was handed over to British custody. He was held first at Wilton Park in Buckinghamshire, then at Grizedale Hall in northern Lancashire, then at Island Farm near Bridgend in Glamorgan, South Wales. The British climate badly affected his arthritis, making him increasingly lame. His heart condition became worse and he was periodically depressed. One interviewer wrote: &quot;A limp, exhausted body racked by constant pain due to weakened arteries is now the remnant of the relentless figure that once waved a Marshal&#x27;s baton.&quot; During this period he was extensively interviewed by the military writer Basil Liddell Hart, who later used these and other interviews as the basis for his books &quot;The Other Side of the Hill&quot; and its U.S. equivalent &quot;The German Generals Talk&quot;, published in 1948. Liddell Hart and Rundstedt developed a close rapport, and the relationship was to prove very valuable to Rundstedt over the next few years. Liddell Hart wrote of him: &quot;Rundstedt makes an increasingly favourable impression on me ... He is dignified without being arrogant, and essentially aristocratic in outlook.&quot;

===Defence witness at Nuremberg===
When Rundstedt learned that he was not to be tried personally at Nuremberg, he wrote to the Tribunal asking permission to appear as a defence witness for the Army high command. In May 1946 he was summoned to appear. When he left Island Farm, all the 185 senior officers being held there lined up to salute him. On 19 June he appeared before a preliminary hearing of the IMT Commission. Since he was a witness, not a defendant, the questioning was not intended to prove Rundstedt&#x27;s guilt: it was designed to bolster the prosecution&#x27;s case that the high command had functioned as an organisation and that it was collectively responsible for the German invasions of various countries between 1939 and 1941 and also for the war crimes committed during those invasions. Rundstedt was adamant that the high command played no part in the decisions to invade Poland, Norway, France or the Soviet Union. He insisted that the Army had obeyed the laws of war and was not responsible for the actions of the . He also denied that the Army had deliberately starved three million Soviet prisoners of war to death in 1941–42.

On 12 August Rundstedt took the stand before the IMT itself. His counsel, Dr Hans Laternser, took him over the same ground which had been covered before the commission. He insisted that military law was &quot;always binding for us older leaders&quot;, and that officers who broke these laws were court-martialed. He stated: &quot;As senior soldier of the German Army, I will say this: we accused leaders were trained in the old soldierly traditions of decency and chivalry. We lived and acted according to them, and we endeavoured to hand them down to the younger officers.&quot; Cross-examined by the British prosecutor Peter Calvocoressi, he stuck to his position that the high command did not function as an organisation. Senior commanders discussed only operational matters, he said: political and strategic questions were decided by Hitler and the OKW. Rundstedt made a good impression as a witness. Calvocoressi later commented: &quot;He was not going to let on how much he and his colleagues had known or done. He did this well – or anyway successfully.&quot;

The success of Rundstedt&#x27;s efforts was shown in October 1946, when the IMT handed down its verdicts. Keitel and Jodl were to be hanged, but the Army high command as a whole was acquitted. The verdict read: &quot;According to the indictment, this group consists of about 130 officers who held certain positions in the military hierarchy between 1938 and 1945 ... The Tribunal does not find that they were an organisation ... They were only an aggregation of those who happened to hold high rank in a certain period ... These men have, however, been a disgrace to the profession of arms, and they have made a mockery of obedience to orders. They were a ruthless military caste, and were guilty of crimes and should be brought to trial as individuals.&quot; Thus the possibility was left open that Rundstedt could still face individual prosecution for his actions.

===War crimes prosecution===
Rundstedt returned to Island Farm to await developments. Otto John, a German lawyer who had been active in the German resistance, arrived in October to interview the prisoners and make recommendations on possible future war crimes prosecutions. John and Rundstedt got on well, and in November John arranged for Hans Gerd von Rundstedt, who was suffering from the early stages of throat cancer, to be released and sent home. In April 1947 the Allied War Crimes Investigation Group operating in Germany recommended that Rundstedt should not face prosecution. The U.S. government, however, did not accept this recommendation and insisted that Rundstedt, Manstein, Brauchitsch and General Rudolf Strauss (an Army commander on the Russian front in 1941) should stand trial. All four were in British custody. In August Telford Taylor, the U.S. Chief Counsel for War Crimes, formally advised the British Attorney-General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, of his intentions. The grounds for the prosecution would be the Commissar Order of 1941, the Commando Order of 1942, the murder of Soviet prisoners-of-war, the conscription and deportation of civilians in occupied countries as forced labour, and the responsibility of the named officers for the invasions of Poland, France, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and other countries.

The British, however, were extremely reluctant to act. British public opinion had rapidly shifted (as it did after World War I) away from anti-German sentiment towards a desire for reconciliation. There was a strong feeling that putting elderly and sick men on trial three years after the war was unjust. There was also the fact that many of the events referred to by the Americans had taken place in the Soviet Union and Poland, which were now, with the onset of the Cold War, political adversaries and no longer cooperating with western war crimes investigations. The British Military Governor in Germany, Air Marshal Sir Sholto Douglas, was strongly opposed. He wrote: &quot;We are apparently prepared to send these men, including one who is 73, to trial by the Americans. I frankly do not like this. I feel that if the Americans wish to be critical in our inaction in trying war criminals, I should prefer that they should continue to criticise rather than that we should commit an injustice in order to avoid their criticism.&quot;

Rundstedt and the other officers knew nothing of the proposed prosecutions. In June 1947, his son Hans Gerd was admitted to hospital and it soon became apparent that his cancer was inoperable. In December Rundstedt was granted compassionate leave by the British government to visit the hospital in Hanover where Hans Gerd was being treated. On Christmas Day he saw his wife for the first time since May 1945, and his grandchildren for the first time since 1941. Hans Gerd died on 12 January 1948: &quot;a blow from which he never really recovered.&quot; On Rundstedt&#x27;s return he was given a medical examination. The doctors reported &quot;a markedly senile general physique&quot;, chronic arterio-sclerosis, osteoarthritis in most of his joints, and failing memory. The examiners advised that to put him on trial would &quot;adversely affect his health.&quot; A similar recommendation was made about Brauchitsch, although Manstein was judged fit to stand trial. As a result, the Secretary of State for War, Manny Shinwell, recommended to Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin that the prosecutions should not proceed. Bevin was put in a quandary, fearing the reactions of countries such as France and Belgium if Rundstedt were to be released. In March the Soviet government formally demanded Rundstedt&#x27;s extradition to the Soviet Union.

Meanwhile, the Americans had requested that Rundstedt and Manstein be brought to Nuremberg to appear as a witness in the High Command Trial, in which a number of prominent generals, including Leeb, Blaskowitz (who committed suicide during the trial), Hugo Sperrle, Georg von Küchler and Hermann Hoth were on trial for war crimes. In May, therefore, Rundstedt was transferred from Island Farm to a military hospital in Norfolk. On 22 July Rundstedt left the hospital and the next day he and Manstein were flown to Nuremberg. But the presiding judge in the case ruled that he would not allow Rundstedt or Manstein to testify unless they were first informed whether they were themselves in danger of prosecution. Thus Rundstedt and Manstein discovered for the first time that the Americans had requested their indictment. As a result, they refused to testify. They were then transferred to a military hospital near Munster. Here conditions were so bad that Brauchitsch went on a hunger strike.

In August the matter became public when Liddell Hart launched a press campaign to have the four officers released. He was supported by figures such as Michael Foot, Victor Gollancz and Lord De L&#x27;Isle, VC. On 27 August the government responded by formally announcing that the four would be tried by a British military court in Hamburg. Items in Rundstedt&#x27;s indictment included: &quot;the maltreatment and killing of civilians and prisoners of war ... killing hostages, illegal employment of prisoners of war, deportation of forced labour to Germany ... mass execution of Jews ... and other war crimes, yet to be specified.&quot; On 24 September the four were moved to a military hospital in Hamburg, where they were allowed to be visited by their families. It was here that Brauchitsch died suddenly of heart failure on 18 October. This led to a renewed outcry in Britain for the trial to be abandoned. Nevertheless, Bevin was determined to press ahead, and on 1 January 1949 Rundstedt, Manstein and Strauss were formally charged. Hugo Laternser was engaged as Rundstedt&#x27;s counsel, and Liddell Hart and others in Britain collected material for the defence. The Bishop of Chichester, George Bell, announced that he would bring in a motion in the House of Lords critical of the government. This was a serious threat since the Lords had the power to compel the government to produce documents.

By April the public debate in Britain was becoming so damaging that the government decided that the best option was to back down as gracefully as it could. The government&#x27;s resolve was stiffened by the refusal of the Soviet government to provide any evidence for the trial. Further medical reports were commissioned, with varying results. A team of British Army doctors eventually reported that Rundstedt and Strauss were unfit to stand trial, and the government used this as a pretext to abandon the trial. On 28 April Cabinet considered the medical reports, and asked the Lord Chancellor, Lord Jowitt, to prepare a report for its next meeting. On 5 May Cabinet accepted his recommendation that Rundstedt and Strauss be released, but that Manstein&#x27;s trial should go ahead. Rundstedt was formally advised of his release on 19 May, but since he had nowhere to go he stayed in the hospital until 26 May, when he finally left British custody and went to the home of his brother Udo at Ratzeburg in Schleswig-Holstein.

===Last years===
Rundstedt was now a free man after four years in custody, but it brought him little joy. He was 73, frail and in poor health. He had no home, no money and no income. The family home in Kassel had been requisitioned by the Americans, and the Rundstedt estate in Saxony-Anhalt was in the Soviet Zone and had been confiscated. His wife was living in Solz, but this was in the American Zone, where he could not travel because the Americans (who were displeased by the British decision to release him) still regarded him as a Class 1 war criminal under the denazification laws then in force. Likewise, his money, in a bank account in Kassel, was frozen because of his classification, which also denied him a military pension. The British had assured him that he would not be arrested or extradited if he stayed in the British Zone, but the Americans had made no such guarantee. &quot;It is an awful situation for me and my poor wife,&quot; he wrote to Liddell Hart. &quot;I would like to end this life as soon as possible.&quot;

Meanwhile, Rundstedt was in a hospital in Hanover with nowhere to live, and the new SPD administration in Lower Saxony had no interest in helping ex-Field Marshals of the Third Reich at a time when there was an acute housing shortage across Germany. He and Bila were temporarily housed in an elderly persons home near Celle.
In the last years of his life, Rundstedt became a subject of increasing interest and was interviewed by various writers and historians. His former chief of staff, Günther Blumentritt, visited him frequently, and began work on an apologetic biography, which was published in 1952. In 1951 he was portrayed sympathetically by Leo G. Carroll in a film about Rommel, &quot;The Desert Fox&quot;. Blumentritt and Liddell Hart raised money to provide nursing care for the Rundstedts. Bila died on 4 October 1952; Rundstedt died of heart failure on 24 February 1953 in Hanover. (He had already been at retirement age when the Second World War began.) He was buried in the Stöcken City Cemetery.

==Posthumous reputation==
Rundstedt&#x27;s defence at the trial was that as a soldier he had a duty to obey the orders of the legitimate government, whoever that was, and whatever the orders were. He would have fully agreed with Manstein&#x27;s remark to Rudolf von Gersdorff: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Prussian field marshals do not mutiny!&quot;)

Since the charges brought against Manstein were almost identical to those brought against Rundstedt, it is worth quoting the remarks made by the prosecutor at Manstein&#x27;s trial, Sir Arthur Comyns Carr: &quot;Contemporary German militarism flourished briefly with its recent ally, National Socialism, as well as or better than it had in the generals of the past. Many of these have made a mockery of the soldier&#x27;s oath of obedience to military orders. When it suits their purpose they say they had to obey; when confronted with Hitler&#x27;s brutal crimes which are shown to have been within their general knowledge, they say they disobeyed. The truth is they actively participated in all these crimes, or sat silent and acquiescent, witnessing the commission of crimes on a scale larger and more shocking than the world has ever had the misfortune to know.&quot;

Rundstedt was left in no doubt by Hitler and Himmler what German occupation would mean for the people of Poland and the Soviet Union, yet he applied his military talents to the conquest of both countries. He approved of the Reichenau Order or Severity Order and must have known what it portended for the Jews of Ukraine, yet &quot;sat silent and acquiescent&quot; while the did their work. He claimed that the Army would have liked to feed the three million Soviet POWs, yet he apparently took no interest in their fate once they were taken to the rear. He asserted that he had an absolute duty as an officer to obey orders, yet claimed to have disobeyed both the Commissar Order in Russia and the Commando Order in France. These inconsistencies were exposed both at Nuremberg, in the trials of the leaders (who also claimed they had a duty to obey distasteful orders) and in the 1947 trials of senior officers, and in Manstein&#x27;s trial in 1949. They would certainly also have been exposed if Rundstedt had come to trial. On this basis, his biographer concludes: &quot;If Rundstedt had stood trial, it is clear from the Manstein case that he would have been found guilty of some of the charges levelled against him&quot;.

<text>Benvenuto Cellini (, ; 3 November 150013 February 1571) was an Italian goldsmith, sculptor, and author. His best-known extant works include the &quot;Cellini Salt Cellar&quot;, the sculpture of &quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot;, and his autobiography, which has been described as &quot;one of the most important documents of the 16th century&quot;.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Benvenuto Cellini was born in Florence, in present-day Italy. His parents were Giovanni Cellini and Maria Lisabetta Granacci. They were married for 18 years before the birth of their first child. Benvenuto was the second child of the family. The son of a musician and builder of musical instruments, Cellini was pushed towards music, but when he was fifteen, his father reluctantly agreed to apprentice him to a goldsmith, Antonio di Sandro, nicknamed Marcone. At the age of 16, Benvenuto had already attracted attention in Florence by taking part in an affray with youthful companions. He was banished for six months and lived in Siena, where he worked for a goldsmith named Fracastoro (unrelated to the Veronese polymath). From Siena he moved to Bologna, where he became a more accomplished cornett and flute player and made progress as a goldsmith. After a visit to Pisa and two periods of living in Florence (where he was visited by the sculptor Torrigiano), he moved to Rome, at the age of nineteen.

===Work in Rome===

His first works in Rome were a silver casket, silver candlesticks, and a vase for the bishop of Salamanca, which won him the approval of Pope Clement VII. Another celebrated work from Rome is the gold medallion of &quot;Leda and the Swan&quot; executed for the Gonfaloniere Gabbriello Cesarino, and which is now in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence. He also took up the cornett again, and was appointed one of the pope&#x27;s court musicians.

In the attack on Rome by the imperial forces of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor under the command of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon and Constable of France, Cellini&#x27;s bravery proved of signal service to the pontiff. According to Cellini&#x27;s own accounts, he shot and injured Philibert of Châlon, prince of Orange (and, allegedly, shot and killed Charles III resulting in the Sack of Rome). His bravery led to a reconciliation with the Florentine magistrates, and he soon returned to his hometown of Florence. Here he devoted himself to crafting medals, the more famous of which are &quot;Hercules and the Nemean Lion&quot;, in gold &quot;repoussé&quot; work, and &quot;Atlas supporting the Sphere&quot;, in chased gold, the latter eventually falling into the possession of Francis I of France.

From Florence, he went to the court of the duke of Mantua, and then back to Florence. On returning to Rome, he was employed in the working of jewelry and in the execution of dies for private medals and for the papal mint. In 1529, his brother Cecchino killed a Corporal of the Roman Watch and in turn was wounded by an arquebusier, later dying of his wound. Soon afterward Benvenuto killed his brother&#x27;s killer—an act of blood revenge but not justice as Cellini admits that his brother&#x27;s killer had acted in self-defense. Cellini fled to Naples to shelter from the consequences of an affray with a notary, Ser Benedetto, whom he had wounded. Through the influence of several cardinals, Cellini obtained a pardon. He found favor with the new pope, Paul III, notwithstanding a fresh homicide during the interregnum three days after the death of Pope Clement VII in September 1534. The fourth victim was a rival goldsmith, Pompeo of Milan.

===Ferrara and France===
The plots of Pier Luigi Farnese led to Cellini&#x27;s retreat from Rome to Florence and Venice, where he was restored with greater honour than before. At the age of 37, upon returning from a visit to the French court, he was imprisoned on a charge (apparently false) of having embezzled the gems of the pope&#x27;s tiara during the war. He was confined to the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, escaped, was recaptured, and was treated with great severity; he was in daily expectation of death on the scaffold. While imprisoned in 1539, Cellini was the target of an assassination attempt of murder by ingestion of diamond dust; the attempt failed, for a nondiamond gem was used instead. The intercession of Pier Luigi&#x27;s wife, and especially that of the Cardinal d&#x27;Este of Ferrara, eventually secured Cellini&#x27;s release, in gratitude for which he gave d&#x27;Este a splendid cup.

Cellini then worked at the court of Francis I at Fontainebleau and Paris. Cellini is known to have taken some of his female models as mistresses, having an illegitimate daughter in 1544 with one of them while living in France, whom he named Costanza. Cellini considered the Duchesse d&#x27;Étampes to be set against him and refused to conciliate with the king&#x27;s favorites. He could no longer silence his enemies by the sword, as he had silenced those in Rome.

===Final return to Florence and death===
After several years of productive work in France, but beset by almost continual professional conflicts and violence, Cellini returned to Florence. There he once again took up his skills as a goldsmith, and was warmly welcomed by Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici – who elevated him to the position of court sculptor and gave him an elegant house in Via del Rosario (where Cellini built a foundry), with an annual salary of two hundred scudi. Furthermore, Cosimo commissioned him to make two significant bronze sculptures: a bust of himself, and Perseus with the head of Medusa (which was to be placed in the Lanzi loggia in the centre of the city).

In 1548, Cellini was accused by a woman named Margherita of having committed sodomy with her son Vincenzo, and he temporarily fled to seek shelter in Venice. This was neither the first nor the last time that Cellini was implicated for sodomy (once with a woman and at least three times with men during his life), illustrating his homosexual or bisexual tendencies. For example, earlier in his life as a young man, he was sentenced to pay 12 &quot;staia&quot; of flour in 1523 for relations with another young man named Domenico di Ser Giuliano da Ripa. Meanwhile, in Paris a former model and lover brought charges against him of using her &quot;after the Italian fashion&quot; (i.e., sodomy).

During the war with Siena in 1554, Cellini was appointed to strengthen the defences of his native city, and, though rather shabbily treated by his ducal patrons, he continued to gain the admiration of his fellow citizens by the magnificent works which he produced. According to Cellini&#x27;s autobiography, it was during this period that his personal rivalry with the sculptor Baccio Bandinelli grew. On 26 February 1556, Cellini&#x27;s apprentice Fernando di Giovanni di Montepulciano accused his mentor of having sodomised him many times while &quot;keeping him for five years in his bed as a wife&quot;. This time the penalty was a hefty 50 golden scudi fine, and four years of prison, remitted to four years of house arrest thanks to the intercession of the Medicis. In a public altercation before Duke Cosimo, Bandinelli had called out to him &quot;&quot; (Shut up, you filthy sodomite!) Cellini described this as an &quot;atrocious insult&quot;, and attempted to laugh it off.

After briefly attempting a clerical career, in 1562 he married a servant, Piera Parigi, with whom he claimed he had five children, of whom only a son and two daughters survived him.

He was also named a member (&quot;Accademico&quot;) of the prestigious Accademia delle Arti del Disegno of Florence, founded by the Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the architect Giorgio Vasari. He died in Florence on 13 February 1571 and was buried with great pomp in the church of the Santissima Annunziata.

===Statues===
Besides his works in gold and silver, Cellini executed sculptures of a grander scale. One of the main projects of his French period is probably the Golden Gate for the Château de Fontainebleau. Only the bronze tympanum of this unfinished work, which represents the &quot;Nymph of Fontainebleau&quot; (Paris, Louvre), still exists, but the complete aspect can be known through archives, preparatory drawings and reduced casts.

Upon his return from France to his hometown Florence in 1545, Benvenuto cast a bronze bust of Cosimo I Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany. On this statue, Cellini crafted three anthropomorphic heads on to the armour of the duke. The first of them is &quot;grotesque&quot; situated on the right shoulder of Cosimo. The decorative head is composed of lineaments of a satyr, lion and a man. Two other heads, much smaller than the first and almost identical, can be found beneath the collarbones on the bust&#x27;s front. His most distinguished sculpture is the bronze group of &quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot;, a work (first suggested by Duke Cosimo I de Medici) now in the Loggia dei Lanzi at Florence, his attempt to surpass Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; and Donatello&#x27;s &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot;. The casting of this work caused Cellini much trouble and anxiety, but it was hailed as a masterpiece as soon as it was completed. The original relief from the foot of the pedestal—Perseus and Andromeda—is in the Bargello, and has been replaced by a cast.

By 1996, centuries of environmental pollution exposure had streaked and banded the statue. In December 1996 it was removed from the Loggia and transferred to the Uffizi for cleaning and restoration. It was a slow process, and the restored statue was not returned to its home until June 2000.

===Decorative art and portraiture===

Among his art works, many of which have perished, were a colossal Mars for a fountain at Fontainebleau and the bronzes of the doorway, coins for the Papal and Florentine states, a life-sized silver Jupiter, and a bronze bust of Bindo Altoviti. The works of decorative art are florid in style.
In addition to the bronze statue of Perseus and the medallions previously referred to, the works of art in existence today are a medallion of Clement VII commemorating the peace between the Christian princes, 1530, with a bust of the pope on the reverse and a figure of Peace setting fire to a heap of arms in front of the temple of Janus, signed with the artist&#x27;s name; a signed portrait medal of Francis; a medal of Cardinal Pietro Bembo; and the celebrated gold, enamel and ivory salt cellar (known as &quot;Saliera&quot;) made for Francis I of France at Vienna. This intricate 26-cm-high sculpture, of a value conservatively estimated at 58,000,000 schilling, was commissioned by Francis I. Its principal figures are a naked sea god and a woman, sitting opposite each other with legs entwined, symbolically representing the planet Earth. &quot;Saliera&quot; was stolen from the Kunsthistorisches Museum on 11 May 2003 by a thief who climbed scaffolding and smashed windows to enter the museum. The thief set off the alarms, but these were ignored as false, and the theft remained undiscovered until 8:20 am. On 21 January 2006 the &quot;Saliera&quot; was recovered by the Austrian police and later returned to the Kunsthistorisches Museum where it is now back on Kunstkammer display. 

One of the more important works by Cellini from late in his career was a life-size nude crucifix carved from marble. Although originally intended to be placed over his tomb, this crucifix was sold to the Medici family who gave it to Spain. Today the crucifix is in the Escorial Monastery near Madrid, where it has usually been displayed in an altered form – the monastery added a loincloth and a crown of thorns. For detailed information about this work, see the text by Juan López Gajate in the Further Reading section of this article. Cellini, while employed at the papal mint at Rome during the papacy of Clement VII and later of Paul III, created the dies of several coins and medals, some of which still survive at this now-defunct mint. He was also in the service of Alessandro de Medici, first duke of Florence, for whom he made in 1535 a 40-soldi piece with a bust of the duke on one side and standing figures of the saints Cosima and Damian on the other. Some connoisseurs attribute to his hand several plaques, &quot;Jupiter crushing the Giants,&quot; &quot;Fight between Perseus and Phineus&quot;, a Dog, etc. Other works, such as the portrait bust shown, are not directly attributed but are instead attributed to his workshop.

===Lost works===
The important works which have perished include the uncompleted chalice intended for Clement VII; a gold cover for a prayer book as a gift from Pope Paul III to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, both described at length in his autobiography; large silver statues of Jupiter, Vulcan and Mars, created for Francis I during his stay in Paris; a bust of Julius Caesar; and a silver cup for the cardinal of Ferrara. The magnificent gold &quot;button&quot;, or morse (a clasp for a cape), made by Cellini for the cape of Clement VII, the competition for which is so graphically described in his autobiography, appears to have been sacrificed by Pope Pius VI, with many other priceless specimens of the goldsmith&#x27;s art, in furnishing the 30 million francs demanded by Napoleon I at the conclusion of the campaign against the Papal States in 1797. According to the terms of the treaty, the pope was permitted to pay a third of that sum in plate and jewels. In the print room of the British Museum are three watercolour drawings of this splendid morse by F. Bertoli, done at the insistence of an Englishman named Talman in the first half of the 18th century. The obverse and reverse, as well as the rim, are drawn full size, and moreover the morse with the precious stones set therein, including a diamond then considered the second-largest in the world, is fully described.

===Autobiography===
&quot;The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini&quot; was started in the year 1558 at the age of 58 and ended abruptly just before his last trip to Pisa around the year 1563 when Cellini was approximately 63 years old. The memoirs give a detailed account of his singular career, as well as his loves, hatreds, passions, and delights, written in an energetic, direct, and racy style; as one critic wrote, &quot;Other goldsmiths have done finer work, but Benvenuto Cellini is the author of the most delightful autobiography ever written.&quot; Cellini&#x27;s writing shows a great self-regard and self-assertion, sometimes running into extravagances which are impossible to believe. He even writes in a complacent way of how he contemplated his murders before carrying them out. He writes of his time in Paris:

Parts of his tale recount some extraordinary events and phenomena; such as his stories of conjuring up a legion of devils in the Colosseum, after one of his mistresses had been spirited away from him by her mother; of the marvellous halo of light which he found surrounding his head at dawn and twilight after his Roman imprisonment, and his supernatural visions and angelic protection during that adversity; and of his being poisoned on two separate occasions.

The autobiography was translated into English by Thomas Roscoe, by John Addington Symonds, by Robert H.H. Cust and Sidney J.A. Churchill (1910), by Anne Macdonell, and by George Bull. It has been considered and published as a classic, and commonly regarded as one of the more colorful autobiographies (certainly the most important autobiography from the Renaissance).

===Other works===

Cellini wrote treatises on the goldsmith&#x27;s art, on sculpture, and on design.

===In the works of others===


The following is a list of works influenced by Cellini or that reference him or his work:
* The life of Cellini inspired the French historical novelist Alexandre Dumas, père. His 1843 novel &quot;L&#x27;Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio&quot; is based on Cellini&#x27;s years in France, centered on Ascanio, an apprentice of Cellini. Dumas&#x27; trademark plot twists and intrigues feature in the novel, in this case involving Cellini, the Duchesse d&#x27;Étampes, and other members of the court. Cellini is portrayed as a passionate and troubled man, plagued by the inconsistencies of life under the &quot;patronage&quot; of a false and somewhat cynical court. That novel was the basis for Paul Meurice&#x27;s 1852 play &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; which, in turn, was the basis for Louis Gallet&#x27;s libretto for Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; 1890 opera &quot;Ascanio&quot;.
* Rolex chose to name their line of precious metal dress watches after Cellini, with the Rolex Cellini Collection beginning in 1928 and continuing today.
* Balzac mentions Cellini&#x27;s &quot;Saliera&quot; in his 1831 novel &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot;.
* Cellini was the subject of an eponymous opera by Hector Berlioz, as well as another of the same title by Franz Lachner.
* Cellini&#x27;s life is the subject of the Broadway musical, &quot;The Firebrand of Florence&quot;, by Ira Gershwin and Kurt Weill.
*&quot;The Affairs of Cellini&quot; is a 1934 comedy film directed by Gregory La Cava and starring Frank Morgan, Constance Bennett, Fredric March, Fay Wray, and Louis Calhern. The film was adapted by Bess Meredyth from the play &quot;The Firebrand of Florence&quot; by Edwin Justus Mayer.
* Cellini&#x27;s life is an occasional point of reference in the writings of Mark Twain. Tom Sawyer mentions Cellini&#x27;s autobiography as an inspiration while freeing Jim in the &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Cellini&#x27;s work is also mentioned in &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; in Chapter VII: &quot;Its furniture was all of massy gold, and beautified with designs which well-nigh made it priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto.&quot; And in &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, chapter XVII, Cellini is alluded to as the epitome of brutal, immoral, and yet deeply religious aristocracy.
* Herman Melville compares his character Ahab, at the captain&#x27;s first appearance, to a sculpture by Cellini in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; chapter 28; &quot;His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini&#x27;s cast Perseus.&quot;
* Judy Abbott mentions Cellini&#x27;s autobiography in Jean Webster&#x27;s schoolgirl romance novel &quot;Daddy-Long-Legs&quot;.
* In Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Marius&#x27;s chapter contains the line &quot;There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, even as there are Villons in language.&quot;
* The Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí was also highly influenced by the life of Cellini, centering many etchings and sketches around his stories and passions. 
* Cellini&#x27;s autobiography is mentioned several times in Muriel Spark&#x27;s &quot;Loitering With Intent&quot;.
* Lois McMaster Bujold loosely bases the character Prospero Beneforte in her 1992 fantasy novel &quot;The Spirit Ring&quot; on Cellini and his works.
* The American poet Frank Bidart studies Cellini in &quot;The Third Hour of the Night&quot;, a long poem from his 2005 book &quot;Star Dust&quot;.
* Ian Fleming mentions Cellini multiple times in his James Bond novels. In the second James Bond novel, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, the villain Mr. Big says that he wishes his crimes to &quot;be a work of art, bearing my signature as clearly as the creations of, let us say, Benvenuto Cellini.&quot; In the seventh James Bond novel, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, Bond says of the titular villain: &quot;... Goldfinger was an artist - a scientist in crime as great in his field as Cellini or Einstein in theirs.&quot;
* Fictional works by Cellini feature in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Labours of Hercules&quot;, in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;Rappaccini&#x27;s Daughter&quot;; and the film &quot;The Girl from Missouri&quot; (1934).
* In &quot;The Medusa Amulet&quot; by Roberto Masello, (Vintage 2011), Cellini creates the menacing Medusa Amulet. 
* Evelyn Anthony&#x27;s &quot;The Poellenberg Inheritance&quot; (1972) features the fictional Poellenberg Salt, inspired by the &quot;Saliera&quot;.
* Cellini is mentioned in George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; as reminding the protagonist of a waiter as &quot;a good fellow when one got to know him&quot;.
* The fictional secret agent, Nick Carter, owns a pearl-handled, 400-year-old stiletto said to have been made by Cellini, which is featured regularly in the &quot;Nick Carter-Killmaster&quot; series of novels.
* The 1966 film &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; focuses on Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s character&#x27;s attempts to steal back a fictional statuette of Venus supposedly sculpted by Cellini before art conservators at the museum it has been lent to discover that it is a fake, actually sculpted by her grandfather.
* Full length drama in four acts &quot;A Man of His Time&quot; (1923) by Australian playwright Helen de Guerry Simpson 1897-1940 is entirely concerned with Benvenuto Cellini 1500-1571.
* &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; referenced Cellini several times in the second episode of the series as an artist who lived a particularly &quot;wild&quot; life and that his autobiography was entirely unsuited for a nine-year-old boy.

<text>The University of Scranton is a private Jesuit university in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1888 by William O&#x27;Hara, the first Bishop of Scranton, as St. Thomas College. In 1938, the college was elevated to university status and took the name The University of Scranton. The institution was operated by the Diocese of Scranton from its founding until 1897. While the Diocese of Scranton retained ownership of the university, it was administered by the Lasallian Christian Brothers from 1888 to 1942. In 1942, the Society of Jesus took ownership and control of the university. During the 1960s, the university became an independent institution under a lay board of trustees.

The university is composed of three colleges that each contain both undergraduate and graduate programs. It offers 65 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 29 master&#x27;s degrees, and 4 doctoral programs.

The university enrolls approximately 6,000 graduate and undergraduate students. Most of its students are from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. In 2016, about 58% of its undergraduate students were women and 42% men. In its graduate programs, about 62% are women students and 38% men. The university has about 300 full-time faculty members, approximately 200 of which are tenured.

==History==
In 1888 the first bishop of Scranton, William O&#x27;Hara, began construction of St. Thomas College, the predecessor of the University of Scranton. In September 1892 the college admitted its first students, 62 young men. Staffing passed from diocesan priests and seminarians, to Xaverian Brothers, and after 1897 to Lasallian Christian Brothers. In 1897 the school was broken into three divisions: the college department, a two-year commercial program, and St. Thomas High School which remained open until 1939. Jesuit priest Daniel J. MacGoldrick came from Georgetown University to serve as president from 1895 until his death in 1900. The college awarded degrees through other colleges until 1924, when it received a State charter to grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees in arts and science, and the master of science. In 1938, the Christian Brothers renamed the college &quot;University of Scranton&quot; and began admitting women to the evening division.

The Drama Club began productions in 1893. &quot;The Aquinas&quot; began as a literary monthly in 1915, furnishing also a yearbook edition, evolving into a student newspaper in 1931, and by the 21st century adding a web edition. The current &quot;Windhover&quot; yearbook was first published in 1948 and named for the bird&#x27;s loyalty to its master. The Glee Club dates to 1925. In 1931 the college band began playing at sports events and presenting a spring concert. Three members of the university faculty began producing &quot;Best Sellers: The Semi-Monthly Book Review&quot; in 1941; it remained in print until 1987.

In 1942 governance of the University of Scranton passed over to the Society of Jesuits. In 1944 Scranton Preparatory School was founded, with its first quarters in a former private hospital building; it moved to its present location in 1963 and became independent of the university in 1978.

With the influx of veterans after World War II, three barracks were constructed on the former Scranton Estate and served as classroom space over the following 15 years. After 1946 the athletic teams ceased to be the Tomcats and were called the Royals after the purple color of their uniforms. The Graduate School opened in 1950, soon adding programs in Education, Business Administration, Chemistry, History, and English; all admitted women from the start. In 1951 an Army ROTC unit was established and made obligatory for non-veterans through freshman and sophomore years.

=== Decade of expansion ===
An expansion plan, beginning at $5,000,000, produced fifteen new buildings between 1956 and 1966, with Loyola Hall of Science in 1956 and the first residence halls for students in 1958: Casey, Fitch, Martin, and McCourt. Three years later Denis Edward, Hafey, Lynett, and Hannan residence halls were added. With the death of Worthington Scranton in 1958, the university acquired the remainder of his properties. Alumni Memorial Library was completed in 1960 and Gunster Memorial Student Center in 1961, including the 400-seat Eagen Auditorium. In 1962 the five-storey classroom building St. Thomas Hall was built, which included St. Ignatius Loyola Chapel. At this time the original Wyoming Avenue properties were completely vacated. New construction extended to Driscoll and Nevils residence halls in 1965, raising on-campus housing to 650 male students. In 1967 the first varsity athletic center was completed and named after former president John J. Long who had led the building campaign over more than a decade.

&quot;Esprit&quot;, the university&#x27;s review of arts and letters, first appeared in 1958 and Flannery O&#x27;Connor, friend of a Jesuit, visited the campus to help get it launched.

===Late 20th century===
After campus protests against the Vietnam War in the late 1960s, participation in the ROTC became voluntary in 1969. The same year other regulations were changed: the requirement that students wear coat and tie to class was dropped, students of age were allowed to drink in the dormitories, and only underclassmen with failing grades were subject to a curfew. After 1970 females could visit male dormitories until 10:00 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 a.m. on weekends. The common core curriculum added options after 1970.

In 1966 a university senate was established, whereby faculty and administrators, and later student representatives, could make recommendations to the board of trustees. Until 1969 the Jesuit community exercised ownership of the university. In 1969 lay members were first admitted to a newly independent Board of Trustees. While women had been admitted to evening school and summer classes since 1938, it was only in 1972 that they were first admitted to the College of Arts and Science. Fitch Hall, the first women&#x27;s residence, opened that fall.

Linden Street was closed to form the university commons in 1980 and sculptures were added to beautify the campus: Jacob and the Angel (1982), Ignatius of Loyola and fountain (1988), and Christ the Teacher (1998). The World Premiere Composition Series began performing new works by composers in 1984 and has continued this annual showcase. During the 16-year presidency of Jesuit priest Joseph A. Panuska, two capital campaigns enabled the construction of major new buildings, including the Byron Recreational Complex (1986), Hyland classroom building (1988), Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Memorial Library (1992), and McDade Center for the Performing Arts (1993). Upon Panuska&#x27;s departure, the Board of Trustees renamed in his honor the College of Health, Education, and Human Resources which he had founded in 1987.

=== Twenty-first century ===
In 2000 the Kania School of Management moved to the new, five-storey hall named for John E. Brennan ‘68. The Department of Physical Therapy, founded in 1980, became in 2004 the university&#x27;s first doctoral program, receiving CAPTE certification in 2007. In fall 2011, the new Loyola Science Center added 22 class and seminar rooms and 34 laboratories. Pilarz and Montrone halls on Mulberry Street provided more fitness space, a dining area, and apartment-style units to accommodate 400 juniors and seniors. In 2015 Leahy Hall was dedicated to accommodate the area of physical therapy.

In 1942 the university was primarily a commuter school with fewer than 1,000 students. By 2015 it had come to serve a wide region with an enrollment of approximately 5,500 students in undergraduate, graduate, and nontraditional programs. The university&#x27;s strategic plan for 2015-2020 looks to build on the Jesuit heritage with education that is &quot;engaged, integrated, global&quot;. 

==Academics==
The university grants undergraduate degrees (Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science) in 65 majors. Students may also utilize many pre-professional concentrations, such as pre-medical, pre-law, and pre-dental. The university also has an Honors Program and the SJLA (Special Jesuit Liberal Arts) Program in which select students complete courses in moral philosophy, ethics, theology, and the humanities in addition to their normal course load.

The university also grants graduate degrees in 29 fields, ranging from Accounting and Chemistry to Software Engineering and Theology. The university also offers a Doctor of Physical Therapy program and Doctor of Nursing Practice.

===Curriculum===
The university offers a liberal arts program. Students are required to take the core courses in composition. Students are also required to take two theology courses, two philosophy courses, as well as an elective in one of these two areas. Filling out the general education requirements are 6 credits in science courses, 6 credits in writing intensive courses, 6 credits in cultural diversity courses, 3 credits in a mathematics course, 12 credits in humanities courses and 3 credits in physical education.

=== Honors programs and societies ===

==== Honors program ====
The honors program, first created in 1963 by Academic Vice President William Kelly, stresses independent work and individualized engagement with faculty. The program gives students the opportunity to pursue their research interests through one-on-one tutorials with professors and culminating in a year-long thesis project. Honors Students must take one course, between three and five tutorials, two seminars and the final 6-credit project. Honors courses count toward general education requirements and the tutorials count toward major, minor, cognate or general education requirements. Students can apply to the Honors Program in the fall of their sophomore year. Because a minimum of a 3.5 GPA is required for graduation in the Honors Program, applicants must have at least a 3.3 GPA to be considered. Admission is also based on the applicant&#x27;s high school and college records, SAT scores, application, recommendations, and interviews. Normally around 50 students are accepted into the program.

==== Business leadership ====
The Business Leadership program (BLDR), an honors program in the Kania School of Management (KSOM), teaches students the key components of leadership. The program includes special sections of key business courses taught from the leadership perspective, leadership seminars, a mentor/internship program, and an independent leadership project. The program culminates in the students preparing portfolios on the essence of leadership, as derived from participation in the program, and defending their concepts of leadership before a faculty board. The program accepts 15 sophomores each spring to begin the two-year curriculum the following fall based upon leadership experience and/or potential, student records from high school and college, involvement in clubs and activities, recommendations from professors, and a minimum GPA of a 3.0, because students need at least a 3.5 GPA to graduate with the program.

==== Special Jesuit Liberal Arts ====
The Special Jesuit Liberal Arts program (SJLA) was established in 1975 to model the traditional Jesuit liberal arts education that emphasizes philosophy, theology, history and literature of the Western classical and Christian ages while providing a way for students to fulfill the general education requirements. Through the courses, students develop enhanced writing, oral and critical-thinking skills while also becoming immersed in a community atmosphere that encourages excellence and service to others and an awareness of contemporary issues. Before the start of freshman year, the most qualified incoming students, usually in the top five percent of applicants, are invited to join the four year SJLA program. Students not selected initially may apply for admission as second semester freshmen or as sophomores.

==== Academic honor societies ====
The University of Scranton maintains local chapters of over thirty different international and national honor societies.
* Alpha Sigma Nu: Founded at Marquette University in 1915, Alpha Sigma Nu is the national Jesuit Honor Society, with chapters at twenty-eight Jesuit universities throughout the United States. The University of Scranton&#x27;s chapter was founded in 1943, one year after the Jesuits assumed control of the university. Alpha Sigma Nu is the oldest honor society at the university. Alpha Sigma Nu is the only honor society at the university which accepts students and faculty from all three colleges and all disciplines. Juniors and seniors who have distinguished themselves in scholarship, loyalty and service are eligible for membership. Its selection process is rigorous. First, the Registrar compiles lists of students in the top 15% of their classes based on GPA, separately for juniors, seniors, and graduate students based on their college. Juniors are those having completed 60-89 credits; seniors 90+ credits; graduate students at least 18 graduate credits. Then, the honor society solicits nominations from current ΑΣΝ members, including faculty, staff, and student members, who have received the list of students in the top 15% of their classes. The chapter coordinator and faculty advisor compile the nominations. The student officers review the nominations and make selections of student nominees. The faculty advisor provides guidance on the selection process. Student selections are sent to the deans of the respective colleges for review. Student and honorary selections are sent to the university president for his review. A letter is sent to persons approved by the President inviting them to become members of ΑΣΝ. The final list of inductees consists of those accepting membership.

The center also contains offices for Student Affairs, University Ministries, and the Student Forum which comprises the Center for Student Engagement, the University of Scranton Programming Board (USPB), the &quot;Aquinas&quot; newspaper, the &quot;Windhover&quot; yearbook, the Jane Kopas Women&#x27;s Center, the Multicultural Center, Student Government, and Community Outreach.
* Dionne Green: in 2008, after the completion of the DeNaples Center and the subsequent demolition of Gunster Memorial Student Center, the university created the Dionne Green, a 25,000-square-foot green space roughly the size of a football field featuring a 3,600 sq ft outdoor amphitheater. Located directly in front of the DeNaples Center, it serves as the gateway to the campus. 
* The Estate: in 1867, Joseph H. Scranton, one of the founders of the city of Scranton, commissioned the building of his family home in the French Second Empire Style, which was completed in 1871. The twenty-five room, three story residence contained a billiards room, a ballroom, a library, a Tiffany Glass skylight, and a solid mahogany staircase. The Estate was occupied by members of the Scranton family until 1941, when Worthington Scranton donated the home and its adjoining estate to the university. The home was used as the Jesuit residence from 1942 until 1987 and currently houses the Admissions Office. 
* Fitzpatrick Field: the field was completed in 1984. The facility was designed as a multi-sports complex, complete with a regulation-size field for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer which also can be used for other sports such as lacrosse, field hockey, and intramural athletics. It also has bleachers, an electronic scoreboard, a maintenance building, a storage area, and a parking lot. In 1997, a re-dedication ceremony celebrated the installation of new artificial turf and improved lighting for the field. Currently, Fitzpatrick Field remains the university&#x27;s primary outdoor athletic facility. 
* Founder&#x27;s Green: in 2001, after the demolition of the Gallery Building whose departments had been moved to O&#x27;Hara and Hyland Halls, the university created Founder&#x27;s Green, a large, open green space in front of Brennan Hall. 
* Galvin Terrace: after the completion of St. Thomas Hall and the subsequent demolition of the Barracks buildings, the university created an outdoor recreation facility, containing four volleyball courts, three basketball courts, a grass practice field for football and soccer, and a faculty parking lot. Later, after renovations, it included six tennis courts, two combination basketball/volleyball courts, and four handball/racquetball courts. In the early 1990s, the recreational complex was demolished to make room for the Weinberg Memorial Library and now a small garden outside the Library is known as Galvin Terrace. 
* Long Center: completed in 1967, the building contained the university&#x27;s first indoor athletic facilities, as well as instructional areas for physical education. At the time of its construction, the top floor featured a large entrance foyer and a gymnasium, complete with movable bleacher seats that could accommodate up to 4,500 people. The gymnasium contained three basketball courts, two ticket rooms, a sound control room, locker room facilities, a training room, a weight room, a wrestling room, laundry facilities, and equipment room, and offices for the director and assistants of the physical education program as well as athletic coaches. From 2001 until 2015, it housed the Department of Exercise Science, including offices, classrooms, a fitness assessment center, and laboratories for sport biomechanics, body composition, cardio-metabolic analysis, biochemistry, and muscular skeletal fitness, which was then moved to Leahy Hall. 
* Mosque: in 1996, the university community renovated a university-owned house at 317 North Webster Avenue into the Campus Mosque as a gift to the Muslim community of Scranton. The Mosque contained two large, spacious rooms as the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s prayer rooms, a library, and an apartment where two members of the Muslim Student Association lived and served as caretakers of the facility. In 2007, the Mosque, along with several other properties, was razed in order to create a site for the sophomore residence, Condron Hall. The university then purchased and renovated a house at 306 Taylor Avenue for use as the new mosque, which is open to the public for prayer and reflection.
* Pantle Rose Garden: when the University of Scranton acquired the Scranton family estate in the mid-1950s, the school received the garden, located next to the Chapel of the Sacred Heart on the former grounds of the Estate. 
* Parking and Public Safety Pavilion: completed in 1995, the Parking and Public Safety Pavilion accommodates 510 cars in its five stories, with one floor below ground, one floor at ground level, and three above ground. Additionally, the parking garage contains the offices of the university&#x27;s police and the offices of parking services.
* Quain Memorial Conservatory: the Victorian-style structure, built in 1872, was part of the Scranton family Estate and donated to the university in 1958. The glass building has a central square (20 ft by 20 ft) flanked by two 40 ft by 15 ft wings on either side. At the time of its construction, each section had its own pool. In the early 1970s, the student-led University Horticultural Society coordinated and organized an effort to renovate and restore the greenhouse. Currently, the greenhouse is used for classes as well as faculty and personal research projects.
* Retreat Center at Chapman Lake: in 1961, the University of Scranton purchased a nine-acre tract of lakefront property containing three buildings on Chapman Lake, about 30 minutes away from the university. For several years, it was chiefly used as a place for relaxation by the Jesuits and for conferences with faculty members and student leaders. As time progressed, the university&#x27;s Office of Campus Ministries began using the Chapman Lake property as a Retreat Center. The site originally had one old retreat house, featuring several bedrooms equipped with bunkbeds, a small chapel, a main room with a fireplace, a kitchen, and dining area. In 1998, the university expanded the lakeside Conference and Retreat Center. Doubling the size of the center, the new 16,000 square-foot facility contained a dining room, kitchen, a large meeting room nicknamed the Lake Room, five small meeting rooms, and a residential wing with 11 bedrooms. In 2005, in order to meet the growing demand for retreats, the university expanded the Retreat Center again. The new addition contained a lounge, 21 more bedrooms, and the Peter Faber chapel with large window views of the Lake. Retreats offered at Chapman Lake are usually offered and run by staff and students from the University of Scranton&#x27;s Office of Campus Ministries. More than 1,400 people participate annually in about 50 retreats and other spiritual programs conducted at Chapman Lake by the university. Retreats are offered virtually every weekend, including retreats for seniors as they prepare to end their college careers, for students interested in learning about Ignatian spirituality, for students who have never experienced a retreat before, for students seeking a better understanding of faith and Christian living, and for participants searching for answers to help them through the challenges they face as students.
* Roche Wellness Center: the building, constructed in 1986, formerly housed Hazzouri&#x27;s pharmacy and drugstore as well as a restaurant named Babe&#x27;s Place. It was acquired by the university in 1992 and opened as the Student Health and Wellness Center in 1996 and the Drug and Alcohol Information Center and Educators (DICE) Office. The building holds a reception area, four exam rooms, a laboratory, an assessment room, an observation room, and storage space.
* Rock Hall: in 1983, the University of Scranton purchased the Assembly of God Church from the Reformed Episcopalian congregation who could no longer properly maintain the facility as the costs and utilities were too high. Rock Hall houses the Madonna della Strada Chapel, which serves as the primary site for the university&#x27;s major liturgical services, including the regular Sunday masses. Currently, the first floor of Rock Hall is the home of the university&#x27;s Military Science department and ROTC program.
* Scranton Hall: constructed in 1871, Scranton Hall was built as a one-story carriage house and stable on the Scranton family Estate by Joseph H. Scranton. In 1928, Worthington Scranton and his wife added an additional story, renovating the building and converting it into an office space. The building was donated to the university in 1958. Since it was acquired, the building has been used to house the President&#x27;s Office and other administrative offices.
* University Commons are the main walkways through the university&#x27;s campus. In 1980, the University of Scranton received approval from the Scranton City Council to close to vehicular traffic the portion of Linden Street which ran through the campus in order to unify the campus and create a safer environment for its students. Later, in the early 1990s, the university also closed part of Quincy Avenue and converted it into a pedestrian walkway.

===Student housing===
The university has 13 traditional residences: &quot;Casey Hall&quot;, &quot;Denis Edward Hall&quot;, &quot;Driscoll Hall&quot;, &quot;Fitch Hall&quot;, &quot;Gannon Hall&quot;, &quot;Giblin-Kelly Hall&quot;, &quot;Lavis Hall&quot;, &quot;McCormick Hall&quot;, &quot;Hafey Hall&quot;, &quot;Lynett Hall&quot;, &quot;Martin Hall&quot;, &quot;McCourt Hall&quot;, &quot;Nevils Hall&quot;, which provide housing for freshman students. These residence halls contain traditional double-rooms that share a community restroom on each floor. Most of these buildings were constructed in the 1960s, when the university was becoming a residential campus.

Sophomore students are offered suite-style housing, in which two double rooms share a shower and toilet, with each room having its own sink. There are three buildings, clustered together on the edge of the campus, which house sophomores: &quot;Condron Hall&quot; (2008), &quot;Redington Hall&quot;, and &quot;Gavigan Hall&quot;.

Junior and senior students are offered apartments and houses, which have more private options for residents. The university&#x27;s apartment buildings include: &quot;Linden St. Apartments&quot;, &quot;Madison Square&quot;, &quot;Mulberry Plaza&quot;, &quot;Montrone Hall&quot;, and &quot;Pilarz Hall&quot;. The university also owns a number of residential houses scattered throughout the campus and the historic Hill Section of the city which they use to house students depending on the need for additional housing, most of which were originally acquired during the 1970s and 1980s. These include: &quot;Blair House&quot;, &quot;Fayette House&quot;, &quot;Gonzaga House&quot;, &quot;Herold House&quot;, &quot;Liva House&quot;, &quot;McGowan House&quot;, &quot;Cambria House&quot;, &quot;Monroe House&quot;, &quot;Tioga House&quot;, and &quot;Wayne House&quot;. After sophomore year, students can also elect to live off-campus in the residential and historic Hill Section located adjacent to the university&#x27;s campus.

Graduate students can either chose to rent houses in the Hill Section, or live in the university-owned &quot;Quincy Apartments&quot;, located on the 500 block of Quincy Avenue which was just transformed from an abandoned high school into an early childhood learning center and University graduate housing in 2015.

In 2018 The university renamed McCormick Hall MacKillop Hall and Hannan Hall Giblin-Kelly Hall. The building named Timlin Hall within Mulberry Plazza had its name removed and Mulberry Plazza was renamed Romero Plazza.

These three buildings which were named after Bishops J. Carroll McCormick, Jerome D. Hannan, and James C. Timlin were renamed after a Pennsylvania grand jury report found these bishops ignored accusations of clergy sexual abuse. The university also rescinded honorary degrees bestowed on these three men.

==Athletics==

Scranton athletes compete at the NCAA Division III. In 2007, Scranton joined the newly formed Landmark Conference, which ended a long history with the Middle Atlantic/Freedom Conference.

The university offers 19 varsity sports and has won national championships in Men&#x27;s Basketball in 1976 and 1983 and Women&#x27;s Basketball in 1985. The university&#x27;s basketball teams play at the John Long Center located in the heart of the campus. The university&#x27;s soccer and field hockey teams play at Fitzpatrick Field, also on campus.

In February 2012, the university fully acquired the South Side Sports Complex in Scranton. The complex was converted into NCAA-regulation fields for soccer, baseball, and softball. The complex includes a child&#x27;s play area and public basketball courts.

In February 2016, the athletic director suspended the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Swimming and Diving team from the Landmark Conference championship meet for alleged hazing.

In fall 2016, women&#x27;s golf was added to the athletics program. They debuted with a 5–0 victory in September 2016.

==Student life==

===Media===
&quot;The Aquinas&quot;, the university&#x27;s student newspaper, publishes on Thursdays during the academic year. WUSR 99.5 is the college radio station owned and operated by the University of Scranton.

=== Student government ===
The Student Senate came about in the spring semester of 2002 with the ratification of its Constitution. On May 3, 2002, the first Student Senate meeting was held in the Office of Student Activities. Today, the Student Senate assembles for regular sessions on a biweekly basis and for emergency sessions as necessary.

The Student Senate is the main avenue of governance for the students. The Student Senate deals with pertinent issues that affect the day-to-day lives of students at The University of Scranton. The Senate is chaired by the vice-president of student government, who votes only in the case of a tie. The other Executive members of student government are the president, a nonvoting member with veto authority, as well as the secretary and treasurer, both non-voting members. The body of the Student Senate is made up of the non-voting executive positions, and four equal representatives from each class, two commuter representatives, two off-campus representatives, and two resident representatives for a total of 26 members, 22 of which have voting rights.

There are four standing committees formed out of the Senate: Safety and Crime Prevention, Student Life and Dining Services, Academic Affairs, and Appropriations. Proposed legislation is sent to the appropriate committee for research and development at the discretion of the chair. The executive treasurer advises the Appropriations Committee; a senator appointed by the executive council chairs each of the committees.

==University of Scranton Press==

Its publications included books on religious and philosophical issues and local (Northeastern Pennsylvania) history, including coal mining. In the summer of 2010, the university announced that it was no longer accepting submissions for publication and would discontinue the Press after all current projects were completed, which it did by the end of the summer.

<text>Peter Benenson (born Peter James Henry Solomon; 31 July 1921 – 25 February 2005) was a British barrister, human rights activist and the founder of the human rights group Amnesty International (AI); a global movement of more than 10 million people, currently, and in over 150 countries and territories who campaign to end abuses on human rights and to secure the release of political prisoners. 

He refused all honours for most of his life, but in his 80s, largely to please his family, he accepted the Pride of Britain Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2001. In the 1980s, he became the Chairman of Association of Christians Against Torture. Also, in the 1990s Peter Benenson organized aid for Romanian orphans. He also founded a group to aid victims of celiac disease which he had.

==Early life==
Benenson was born in London to a large Jewish family, the only son of British-born Harold Solomon and Russian-born Flora Benenson; Peter Benenson adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name later in life. His father, an army officer, died from a long-term injury when Benenson was nine, and he was privately tutored by W. H. Auden before attending Eton College. At the age of sixteen, he helped to establish a relief fund with other schoolboys for children orphaned by the Spanish Civil War. He took his mother&#x27;s maiden name of Benenson acceding to his dying grandfather’s wishes, the Russian financier Grigori Benenson (1860–1939).

He enrolled for study at Balliol College, Oxford, but World War II interrupted his education. He served in the Intelligence Corps at the Ministry of Information, where he met his first wife, Margaret Anderson. He worked at Bletchley Park during World War II in the Testery. He is listed as RSM Benenson in Room 41 as a cryptographer.

==Career==
After demobilisation in 1946, Benenson began practising as a barrister before joining the Labour Party and standing unsuccessfully for election at Streatham in 1950 and for Hitchin in 1951, 1955, and 1959. He was one of a group of British lawyers who, in 1957, founded JUSTICE, the UK-based human rights and law reform organisation. In 1958, he fell ill and moved to Italy to convalesce. In the same year, he converted to the Roman Catholic Church.
===Activism===
Benenson had said he was shocked and angered by a newspaper report of two Portuguese people sentenced to prison for subversion during the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar. At the time, Portugal was ruled by the authoritarian Estado Novo regime, and anti-regime conspiracies were vigorously repressed by the Portuguese state police and deemed anti-Portuguese. He wrote to David Astor, editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;. On 28 May 1961, Benenson&#x27;s article, entitled &quot;The Forgotten Prisoners&quot;, was published. The letter asked readers to write letters showing support for all those imprisoned for their political or religious beliefs. To co-ordinate such letter-writing campaigns, Amnesty International was founded in London in July 1961 at a meeting of Benenson and six other men, who included a Conservative, a Liberal and a Labour MP. The response was so overwhelming that within a year various groups of letter-writers had formed in more than a dozen countries.

==Amnesty International==
Initially appointed general secretary of AI, Benenson stood down in 1964 owing to ill health. By 1966, Amnesty International faced an internal crisis. The advisory position of president of the International Executive was then created for him. In 1966, after a controversial report alleging torture during the Aden Emergency went ultimately unpublished, he began to make allegations that the British government had infiltrated the governance of AI. An inquiry was set up which reported at Elsinore in Denmark in 1967. The allegations were rejected and Benenson resigned from AI. 

While never again active in the organisation, Benenson was later personally reconciled with other executives, including Seán MacBride.

==Personal life==
Benenson&#x27;s marriage to his first wife Margaret Anderson ended in a divorce in 1972, he had two children to her, Natasha Benenson and Jilly Benenson. He married Susan Booth in 1973 and had two children, Manya Benenson and Joachim Benenson.

==Death==
Benenson died of pneumonia on 25 February 2005 at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, aged 83, having been a resident of the nearby village of Nuneham Courtenay where he was buried.

<doc id="161151" wikidata="Q452281" url="?curid=161151" title="Lucy Stone">
<text>Lucy Stone (August 13, 1818 – October 18, 1893) was an American orator, abolitionist and suffragist who was a vocal advocate for and organizer of promoting rights for women. In 1847, Stone became the first woman from Massachusetts to earn a college degree. She spoke out for women&#x27;s rights and against slavery. Stone was known for using her birth name, after marriage, contrary to the custom of women taking their husband&#x27;s surname.

Stone&#x27;s organizational activities for the cause of women&#x27;s rights yielded tangible gains in the difficult political environment of the 19th century. Stone helped initiate the first National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts, and she supported and sustained it, annually, along with a number of other local, regional, and state activist conventions. Stone spoke in front of a number of legislative bodies, to promote laws giving more rights to women. She assisted in establishing the Woman&#x27;s National Loyal League to help pass the Thirteenth Amendment and thereby abolish slavery, after which she helped form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which built support for a woman suffrage Constitutional amendment by winning woman suffrage at the local and state levels.

Stone wrote, extensively, about a wide range of women&#x27;s rights, publishing and distributing speeches by herself and others, and convention proceedings. In the long-running and influential &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, a weekly periodical that she founded and promoted, Stone aired both her own and differing views about women&#x27;s rights. Called &quot;the orator&quot;, the &quot;morning star,&quot; and the &quot;heart and soul&quot; of the women&#x27;s rights movement, Stone influenced Susan B. Anthony to take up the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage. Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote that &quot;Lucy Stone was the first person by whom the heart of the American public was deeply stirred on the woman question.&quot; Together, Anthony, Stanton, and Stone have been called the 19th-century &quot;triumvirate&quot; of women&#x27;s suffrage and feminism.

== Early life and influences ==
Lucy Stone was born on August 13, 1818, on her family&#x27;s farm at Coy&#x27;s Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. She was the eighth of nine children born to Hannah Matthews and Francis Stone. She grew up with three brothers and three sisters, two siblings having died before her own birth. Another member of the Stone household was Sarah Barr, &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; to the children – a sister of Francis Stone who had been abandoned by her husband and left dependent upon her brother. Although farm life was hard work for all and Francis Stone tightly managed the family resources, Lucy remembered her childhood as one of &quot;opulence,” the farm producing all the food the family wanted and enough extra to trade for the few store-bought goods they needed.

When Stone recalled that &quot;There was only one will in our family, and that was my father&#x27;s&quot;, she described the family government characteristic of her day. Hannah Stone earned a modest income through selling eggs and cheese but was denied any control over that money, sometimes denied money to purchase things Francis considered trivial. Believing she had a right to her own earnings, Hannah sometimes stole coins from his purse or secretly sold a cheese. As a child, Lucy resented instances of what she saw as her father&#x27;s unfair management of the family&#x27;s money. But she later came to realize that custom was to blame, and the injustice only demonstrated &quot;the necessity of making custom right, if it must rule.&quot;

From the examples of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were at the mercy of their husbands&#x27; good will. When she came across the biblical passage, &quot;and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee,” she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women&#x27;s subjugation, but then, she reasoned that the injunction applied only to wives. Resolving to &quot;call no man my master,” she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.

One of her biographers, Andrea Moore Kerr, writes, &quot;Stone&#x27;s personality was striking: her unquestioning willingness to take responsibility for other people&#x27;s actions; her &#x27;workaholic&#x27; habits; her self doubt; her desire for control.&quot;

=== Teaching at &quot;a woman&#x27;s pay&quot; ===
At age 16, Stone began teaching in district schools, as her brothers and her sister, Rhoda, also did. Her beginning pay of $1.00 a day was much lower than that of male teachers, and when she substituted for her brother, Bowman, one winter, she received less pay than he received. When she protested to the school committee that she had taught all the subjects Bowman had, it replied that they could give her &quot;only a woman&#x27;s pay.&quot; Lower pay for women was one of the arguments cited by those promoting the hiring of women as teachers: &quot;To make education universal, it must be at moderate expense, and women can afford to teach for one-half, or even less, the salary which men would ask.&quot; Although Stone&#x27;s salary increased along with the size of her schools, until she finally received $16 a month, it was always lower than the male rate.

=== The &quot;woman question&quot; ===
In 1836, Stone began reading newspaper reports of a controversy raging throughout Massachusetts that some referred to as the &quot;woman question&quot; – what was woman&#x27;s proper role in society; should she assume an active and public role in the reform movements of the day? Developments within that controversy, over the next several years, shaped her evolving philosophy on women&#x27;s rights.

A debate over whether women were entitled to a political voice had begun, when many women responded to William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s appeal to circulate antislavery petitions and sent thousands of signatures to Congress, only to have them rejected, in part, because women had sent them. Women abolitionists responded by holding a convention in New York City to expand their petitioning efforts and declaring that &quot;as certain rights and duties are common to all moral beings,” they would no longer remain within limits prescribed by &quot;corrupt custom and a perverted application of Scripture.&quot; After sisters Angelina and Sarah Grimké began speaking to audiences of men and women, instead of women-only groups, as was acceptable, a state convention of Congregational ministers issued a pastoral letter condemning women&#x27;s assuming &quot;the place of man as a public reformer&quot; and &quot;itinerat[ing] in the character of public lecturers and teachers.&quot; Stone attended the convention as a spectator and was so angered by the letter that she determined, &quot;if ever [I] had anything to say in public, [I] would say it, and all the more, because of that pastoral letter.&quot;

Stone read Sarah Grimké&#x27;s &quot;Letters on the Province of Woman&quot; (later republished as &quot;Letters on the Equality of the Sexes&quot;), and told a brother they only reinforced her resolve &quot;to call no man master.&quot; She drew from these &quot;Letters,&quot; when writing college essays and later, her women&#x27;s rights lectures.

Having determined to obtain the highest education she could, Stone enrolled at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1839, at the age of 21. But she was so disappointed in Mary Lyon&#x27;s intolerance of antislavery and women&#x27;s rights that she withdrew, after only one term. The very next month, she enrolled at Wesleyan Academy (later Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy), which she found more to her liking: &quot;It was decided by a large majority in our literary society the other day,&quot; she reported to a brother &quot;that ladies ought to mingle in politics, go to Congress, etc. etc.&quot; Stone read a newspaper account of how a Connecticut antislavery meeting had denied the right to speak or vote to Abby Kelley, recently hired as an antislavery agent to work in that state. Refusing to relinquish her right, Kelley had defiantly raised her hand every time a vote was taken. &quot;I admire the calm and noble bearing of Abby K,&quot; Stone wrote to a brother, &quot;and cannot but wish there were more kindred spirits.&quot;

Three years later, Stone followed Kelley&#x27;s example. In 1843, a deacon was expelled from Stone&#x27;s church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone raised her hand, in his defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though she was a member of the church, she was not a voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly raised her hand for each of the remaining five votes.

After completing a year at coeducational Monson Academy in the summer of 1841, Stone learned that Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Ohio had become the first college in the nation to admit women and had bestowed college degrees on three women. Stone enrolled at Quaboag Seminary in neighboring Warren, where she read Virgil and Sophocles and studied Latin and Greek grammar, in preparation for Oberlin&#x27;s entrance examinations.

== Oberlin ==
In August 1843, just after she turned 25, Stone traveled by train, steamship, and stagecoach to Oberlin College in Ohio, the country&#x27;s first college to admit both women and African Americans. She entered the college, believing that women should vote and assume political office, that women should study the classic professions, and that women should be able to speak their minds in a public forum. Oberlin College did not share all of these sentiments.

In her third year at Oberlin, Stone befriended Antoinette Brown, an abolitionist and suffragist who came to Oberlin in 1845 to study to become a minister. Stone and Brown would eventually marry abolitionist brothers and thus become sisters-in-law.

=== Equal pay strike ===
Stone hoped to earn most of her college expenses through teaching in one of the institute&#x27;s lower departments. But because of its policy against employing first-year students as teachers, the only work Stone could get other than teaching at district schools, during the winter break, was housekeeping chores through the school&#x27;s manual labor program. For this, she was paid three cents an hour—less than half what male students received for their work in the program. Among measures taken to reduce her expenses, Stone prepared her own meals in her dormitory room. In 1844, Stone was given a position teaching arithmetic in the Ladies Department, but, again, received reduced pay, because of her sex.

Oberlin&#x27;s compensation policies required Stone to do twice the labor a male student had to do to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at two o&#x27;clock to fit in work and study, and she found her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone &quot;what was right,&quot; if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father, when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter&#x27;s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid male student teachers.

=== Public speaking ===
In February 1846, Stone intimated to Abby Kelley Foster that she was thinking of becoming a public speaker, but not until the following summer did a storm of controversy over Foster&#x27;s speaking at Oberlin decide the matter for her. Faculty opposition to Foster ignited impassioned discussion of women&#x27;s rights, among the students, especially of a woman&#x27;s right to speak in public, which Stone vigorously defended in a joint meeting of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s literary societies. She followed that campus demonstration by making her first public speech at Oberlin&#x27;s August 1 commemoration of Emancipation in the West Indies.

In the fall of 1846, Stone informed her family of her intention to become a women&#x27;s rights lecturer. Her brothers were, at once, supportive, and her father encouraged her to do what she considered her duty. Her mother and her only remaining sister, however, begged her to reconsider. To her mother&#x27;s fears that she would be reviled, Stone said she knew she would be disesteemed and even hated, but she must &quot;pursue that course of conduct which, to me, appears best calculated to promote the highest good of the world.&quot;

Stone, then, tried to gain practical speaking experience. Although women students could debate each other in their literary society, it was considered inappropriate for them to participate in oral exercises with men; women members of the collegiate rhetoric class were expected to learn by observing their male classmates. So, Stone and first-year student Antoinette Brown, who also wanted to develop skill in public speaking, organized an off-campus women&#x27;s debating club. After gaining a measure of competence, they sought and received permission to debate each other, before Stone&#x27;s rhetoric class. The debate attracted a large student audience, as well as attention from the Faculty Board, which, thereupon, formally banned women&#x27;s oral exercises in coeducational classes. Shortly thereafter, Stone accepted a challenge from a former editor of a county newspaper to a public debate on women&#x27;s rights, and she soundly defeated him. She, then, submitted a petition to the Faculty Board, signed by most members of her graduating class, asking that women chosen to write graduation essays be permitted to read them, themselves, as men so honored did, instead of having them read by faculty members. When the Faculty Board refused and Stone was elected to write an essay, she declined, saying she could not support a principle that denied women &quot;the privilege of being co-laborers with men in any sphere to which their ability makes them adequate.&quot;

Stone received her baccalaureate degree from Oberlin College on August 25, 1847, becoming the first female college graduate from Massachusetts.

== Antislavery apprenticeship ==

Stone gave her first public speeches on women&#x27;s rights in the fall of 1847, first at her brother Bowman&#x27;s church in Gardner, Massachusetts, and a little later in Warren. Stone became a lecturing agent for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in June 1848, persuaded by Abby Kelley Foster that the experience would give her the speaking practice she still felt she needed, before beginning her women&#x27;s rights campaign. Stone immediately proved to be an effective speaker, reported to wield extraordinary persuasive power over her audiences. She was described as &quot;a little meek-looking Quakerish body, with the sweetest, modest manners, and yet, as unshrinking and self-possessed as a loaded cannon.&quot; One of her assets, in addition to a storytelling ability that could move audiences to tears or laughter, as she willed, was said to be an unusual voice that contemporaries compared to a &quot;silver bell,” and of which it was said, &quot;no more perfect instrument had ever been bestowed upon a speaker.&quot;

In addition to helping Stone develop as an orator, the antislavery agency introduced her to a network of progressive reformers within the Garrisonian wing of the abolition movement who assisted her women&#x27;s rights work. In the fall of 1848, she received an invitation from Phoebe Hathaway of Farmington, New York, to lecture for the women who had organized the Seneca Falls women&#x27;s rights convention and the Rochester women&#x27;s rights convention, earlier that summer. These rights conventions provided continuity for the woman&#x27;s rights movement, even though no official organization was actually formed, prior to the Civil War. Most of the well-known leaders, at the time, attended these conventions, except for those who were ill or sick. The best-known of them, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone, met and worked together, harmoniously, as they wrote, discussed, and circulated petitions for the woman&#x27;s rights movement. Although Stone accepted and expected to begin working for them in the fall of 1849, the agency never materialized. In April 1849, Stone was invited to lecture for the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society, and Lucretia Mott took advantage of her presence to hold Pennsylvania&#x27;s first women&#x27;s rights meeting on May 4, 1849. With the help of abolitionists, Stone conducted Massachusetts&#x27; first petition campaigns for the right of women to vote and hold public office. Wendell Phillips drafted the first petitions and accompanying appeals for circulation, and William Lloyd Garrison published them in &quot;The Liberator&quot; for readers to copy and circulate. When Stone sent petitions to the legislature in February 1850, over half were from towns where she had lectured.

== National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention ==
In April 1850, the Ohio Women&#x27;s Convention met in Salem, Ohio, a few weeks before a state convention met to revise the Ohio state constitution. The women&#x27;s convention sent a communication to the constitutional convention requesting that the new constitution secure the same political and legal rights for women that were guaranteed to men. Stone sent a letter praising their initiative and said, &quot;Massachusetts ought to have taken the lead in the work you are now doing, but if she chooses to linger, let her young sisters of the West set her a worthy example; and if the &#x27;Pilgrim spirit is not dead,&#x27; we&#x27;ll pledge Massachusetts to follow her.&quot;
Some of the leaders asked Stone and Lucretia Mott to address the constitutional convention on their behalf, but believing such appeals should come from residents of the state, they declined.

Women&#x27;s rights conventions up to this point had been organized on a regional or state basis. During the annual convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston in 1850, with the support of Garrison and other abolitionists, Stone and Paulina Wright Davis posted a notice for a meeting to consider the possibility of organizing a women&#x27;s rights convention on a national basis.
The meeting was held at Boston&#x27;s Melodeon Hall on May 30, 1850. Davis presided while Stone presented the proposal to the large and responsive audience and served as secretary. Seven women were appointed to organize the convention, with Davis and Stone assigned to conduct the correspondence needed to solicit signatures to the call and recruit speakers and attendance.

A few months before the convention, Stone contracted typhoid fever, while traveling in Indiana, and she nearly died. The protracted nature of Stone&#x27;s illness left Davis as the principal organizer of the first National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention, which met on October 23–24, 1850, in Brinley Hall in Worcester, Massachusetts, with an attendance of about a thousand.
Stone was able to attend the Worcester convention, but her frail health limited her participation, and she made no formal address, until the closing session.

The convention decided not to establish a formal association but to exist as an annual convention with a standing committee to arrange its meetings, publish its proceedings, and execute adopted plans of action. Stone was appointed to the Central Committee of nine women and nine men. The following spring, she became secretary of the committee, and, except for one year, she retained that position, until 1858. As secretary, Stone took a leading part in organizing and setting the agenda for the national conventions, throughout the decade.

== Woman&#x27;s rights orator ==

In May 1851, while in Boston attending the New England Anti-Slavery Society&#x27;s annual meeting, Stone went to the exhibit of Hiram Powers&#x27;s statue &quot;The Greek Slave&quot;. She was so moved by the sculpture that when she addressed the meeting that evening, she poured out her heart about the statue being emblematic of all enchained womanhood. Stone said the society&#x27;s general agent, Samuel May, Jr., reproached her for speaking on women&#x27;s rights at an antislavery meeting, and she replied, &quot;I was a woman, before I was an abolitionist. I must speak for women.&quot; Three months later, Stone notified May that she intended to lecture on women&#x27;s rights, full-time, and she would not be available for antislavery work.
Stone launched her career as an independent women&#x27;s rights lecturer on October 1, 1851. When May continued to press antislavery work upon her, she agreed to lecture for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society on Sundays. Arranging women&#x27;s rights lectures around these engagements, she used pay for her antislavery work to defray expenses of her independent lecturing, until she felt confident enough to charge admission.

=== Dress reform ===

When Stone resumed lecturing in the fall of 1851, she wore a new style of dress that she had adopted during her winter convalescence, consisting of a loose, short jacket and a pair of baggy trousers, under a skirt that fell a few inches below the knees. The dress was a product of the health-reform movement and intended to replace the fashionable French dress of a tight bodice over a whalebone-fitted corset, and a skirt that dragged several inches on the floor, worn over several layers of starched petticoats with straw or horsehair sewn into the hems. Ever since the fall of 1849, when the &quot;Water-Cure Journal&quot; urged women to invent a style of dress that would allow them to use their legs, freely, women across the country had been wearing some form of pants and short skirt, generally called the &quot;Turkish costume&quot; or the &quot;American dress.&quot; Most wore it as a walking or gardening dress, but a letter writer to the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention urged women to adopt it as common attire.

By the spring of 1851, women in several states were wearing the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance newspaper &quot;The Lily,&quot; announced that she was wearing it and printed a description of her dress, along with instructions on how to make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the Bloomer dress, and the name stuck. The Bloomer became a fashion fad, during the following months, as women from Toledo to New York City and Lowell, Massachusetts, held reform-dress social events and festivals. Supporters gathered signatures to a &quot;Declaration of Independence from the Despotism of Parisian Fashion&quot; and organized dress-reform societies. A few Garrisonian supporters of women&#x27;s rights took prominent part in these activities, and one offered silk to any of his friends who would make it into a short skirt and trousers for a public dress. Stone accepted the offer.

When Stone lectured in the dress in the fall of 1851, hers was the first Bloomer most of her audiences had ever seen. But by then, the dress had become controversial. Although newspapers had initially praised the practicality of the new style, they soon turned to ridicule and condemnation, now viewing the trousers as a usurpation of the symbol of male authority. Many women retreated, in the face of criticism, but Stone continued to wear the short dress, exclusively, for the next three years. She also wore her hair short, cut just below her jaw line. After Stone lectured in New York City in April 1853, the report of her speeches in the &quot;Illustrated News&quot; was accompanied by this engraving of Stone in the Bloomer dress.

Stone found the short skirt convenient, during her travels, and she defended it against those who said it was a distraction that hurt the women&#x27;s rights cause. Nevertheless, she disliked the instant attention it drew, whenever she arrived in a new place. In the fall of 1854, she added a dress a few inches longer, for occasional use. In 1855, she abandoned the dress, altogether, and she was not involved in the formation of a National Dress Reform Association in February 1856. Her resumption of long skirts drew the condemnation of such dress-reform leaders as Gerrit Smith and Lydia Sayer Hasbrouk, who accused her of sacrificing principle for the sake of pleasing a husband.

=== Expulsion from church ===

Stone&#x27;s anti-slavery work included harsh criticism of churches that refused to condemn slavery. Her own church in West Brookfield, the First Congregational Church of West Brookfield, was one of those, having expelled a deacon for anti-slavery activities. In 1851, the church expelled Stone, herself. Stone had already moved significantly away from that church&#x27;s Trinitarian doctrines. While at Oberlin, Stone had arranged for her friend, Abby Kelley Foster, and her new husband, Stephen Symonds Foster, to speak, there, on the abolition of slavery. Afterwards, Charles Finney, a prominent professor of theology at Oberlin, denounced the Fosters for their Unitarian beliefs. Intrigued, Stone began to engage in classroom discussions about the Trinitarian-Unitarian controversy and ultimately decided that she was a Unitarian. Expelled from her childhood church, she affiliated with the Unitarian church.

=== Issues of divorce ===

Before her own marriage, Stone felt that women should be allowed to divorce drunken husbands, to formally end a &quot;loveless marriage&quot; so that &quot;a true love may grow up in the soul of the injured one from the full enjoyment of which no legal bond had a right to keep her. Whatever is pure and holy, not only has a right to be, but it has a right, also, to be recognized, and further, I think it has no right not to be recognized.&quot; Stone&#x27;s friends often felt differently about the issue; &quot;Nettee&quot; Brown wrote to Stone, in 1853, that she was not ready to accept the idea, even if both parties wanted divorce. Stanton was less inclined to clerical orthodoxy; she was very much in favor of giving women the right to divorce, eventually coming to the view that the reform of marriage laws was more important than women&#x27;s voting rights.

In the process of planning for women&#x27;s rights conventions, Stone worked against Stanton to remove from any proposed platform the formal advocacy of divorce. Stone wished to keep the subject separate, to prevent the appearance of moral laxity. She pushed &quot;for the right of woman to the control of her own person as a moral, intelligent, accountable being.&quot; Other rights were certain to fall into place, after women were given control of their own bodies. Years later, Stone&#x27;s position on divorce would change.

=== Differences with Douglass ===
In 1853, Stone drew large audiences with a lecture tour through several southern states. Former slave Frederick Douglass rebuked her in his abolitionist newspaper, accusing her of achieving success by putting her anti-slavery principles aside and speaking only of women&#x27;s rights. Douglass, later, found Stone at fault for speaking at a whites-only Philadelphia lecture hall, but Stone insisted that she had replaced her planned speech that day with an appeal to the audience to boycott the facility. It took years, before the two reconciled.

=== Western tour ===
On October 14, 1853, following the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, Stone and Lucretia Mott addressed Cincinnati&#x27;s first women&#x27;s rights meeting, arranged by Henry Blackwell, a local businessman from a family of capable women, who had taken an interest in Stone. After that successful meeting, Stone accepted Blackwell&#x27;s offer to arrange a lecture tour for her in the western states – considered, then, to be those west of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Over the following thirteen weeks, Stone gave over forty lectures in thirteen cities, during which a report to the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; said she was stirring the West on women&#x27;s rights &quot;as it is seldom stirred on any subject, whatsoever.&quot; After four lectures in Louisville, Kentucky, Stone was begged to repeat the entire course and told she was having more effect there than she could have anywhere else. An Indianapolis newspaper reported that Stone &quot;set about two-thirds of the women in the town crazy, after women&#x27;s rights, and placed half the men in a similar predicament.&quot; St. Louis papers said her lectures attracted the largest crowds ever assembled, there, filling the city&#x27;s largest auditorium beyond its capacity of two thousand. Chicago papers praised her lectures as the best of the season and said they were inspiring discussion and debate in the city&#x27;s homes and meeting places. When Stone headed home, in January 1854, she left behind incalculable influence.

From 1854 through 1858, Stone lectured on women&#x27;s rights in Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ontario. Elizabeth Cady Stanton would later write that &quot;Lucy Stone was the first speaker who really stirred the nation&#x27;s heart on the subject of woman&#x27;s wrongs.&quot;

== Petitioning and hearings ==
In addition to being the women&#x27;s rights movement&#x27;s most prominent spokesperson, Lucy Stone led the movement&#x27;s petitioning efforts. She initiated petition efforts in New England and several other states and assisted the petitioning efforts of state and local organizations in New York, Ohio, and Indiana.

=== Massachusetts ===
After petitioning the Massachusetts legislature from 1849 through 1852 for the right of women to vote and serve in public office,
Stone aimed her 1853 petitions at the convention that would meet on May 4, 1853, to revise the state constitution. Wendell Phillips drafted both the petition, asking that the word &quot;male&quot; be stricken, wherever it appeared in the constitution, and an appeal urging Massachusetts citizens to sign it. After canvassing the state for nine months, Stone sent the convention petitions bearing over five thousand signatures. On May 27, 1853, Stone and Phillips addressed the convention&#x27;s Committee on Qualifications of Voters. In reporting Stone&#x27;s hearing, the &quot;Liberator&quot; noted: &quot;Never before, since the world was made, in any country, has woman publicly made her demand in the hall of legislation to be represented in her own person, and to have an equal part in framing the laws and determining the action of government.&quot;

=== Multi-state campaigns ===
Stone called a New England Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention in Boston on June 2, 1854, to expand her petitioning efforts. The convention adopted her resolution for petitioning all six New England legislatures, as well as her proposed form of petition, and it appointed a committee, in each state, to organize the work. In a speech before the second New England Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention, held in June 1855, Stone urged that one reason women needed suffrage was to protect any gains achieved, reminding them that &quot;the next Legislature may undo all that the last have done for women.&quot; The convention adopted a resolution calling the ballot &quot;woman&#x27;s sword and shield; the means of achieving and protecting all other civil rights&quot; and another urging the national convention to make suffrage petitioning its priority.

The next National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention met in Cincinnati on October 17 and 18, 1855. It was here that Stone delivered impromptu remarks that became famous as her &quot;disappointment&quot; speech. When a heckler interrupted the proceedings, calling female speakers &quot;a few disappointed women,” Stone retorted that yes, she was, indeed, a &quot;disappointed woman.&quot; &quot;In education, in marriage, in religion, in everything, disappointment is the lot of woman. It shall be the business of my life to deepen this disappointment in every woman&#x27;s heart, until she bows down to it no longer.&quot; The convention adopted Stone&#x27;s resolution calling for the circulation of petitions and saying it was &quot;the duty of women in their respective States to ask the legislators for the elective franchise.&quot; Following the convention, suffrage petitioning took place in the New England states, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska, with resultant legislative hearings or action in Nebraska and Wisconsin. Amelia Bloomer, recently moved to Iowa near the Nebraska border, took up the work in that area, while the Indiana Woman&#x27;s Rights Society, at least one of whose officers was at the Cincinnati convention, directed the work in Indiana. Stone had helped launch the New York campaign at a state woman&#x27;s rights convention in Saratoga Springs in August, and at the Cleveland convention recruited workers for it, as well as for the work in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. Stone took charge of the work in Ohio, her new home state, drafting its petition, placing it in Ohio newspapers and circulating it during lectures across southern Ohio while her recruit worked in the northern part of the state. Stone also lectured in Illinois and Indiana, in support of the petition drives, there, and she personally introduced the work in Wisconsin, where she found volunteers to circulate the petition and legislators to introduce them, in both houses of the legislature.

At the national convention of 1856, Stone presented a new strategy suggested by Antoinette Brown Blackwell to send a memorial to the various state legislatures signed by the officers of the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention. Antoinette Brown had married Samuel Charles Blackwell on January 24, 1856, becoming Stone&#x27;s sister-in-law in the process. Stone, Brown Blackwell, and Ernestine Rose were appointed a committee to carry out the plan. Stone drafted and printed the appeal, and Brown Blackwell mailed it to twenty-five state legislatures. Indiana and Pennsylvania referred the memorial to select committees, while both Massachusetts and Maine granted hearings. On March 6, 1857, Stone, Wendell Phillips and James Freeman Clarke addressed the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts senate, and on March 10, Stone and Phillips addressed a select committee of the Maine legislature.

On July 4, 1856, in Viroqua, Wisconsin, Stone gave the first women&#x27;s rights and anti-slavery speech delivered by a woman in the area.

=== Tax protest ===
In January 1858, Stone staged a highly publicized protest that took the issue of taxation without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying them the right to vote was a violation of America&#x27;s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman&#x27;s suffrage. Stone&#x27;s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the polls to demand their right as taxpayers to vote.

== Marriage ==

Henry Blackwell began a two-year courtship of Stone in the summer of 1853. Stone told him she did not wish to marry because she did not want to surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their mutual agreement. They could also take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets in the hands of a trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone&#x27;s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853. Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual and ideal, as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.

Stone and Blackwell developed a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone&#x27;s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, they agreed that the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being &quot;joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.&quot; Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other&#x27;s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other&#x27;s subsequent earnings. Each would have the right to will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell&#x27;s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: &quot;Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.&quot; During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright&#x27;s book &quot;Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness,&quot; and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple&#x27;s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose &quot;when, where and how often&quot; she would &quot;become a mother.&quot; In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.

The wedding took place at Stone&#x27;s home in West Brookfield, Massachusetts, on May 1, 1855, with Stone&#x27;s close friend and co-worker Thomas Wentworth Higginson officiating. Higginson sent a copy of Stone and Blackwell&#x27;s Protest to the &quot;Worcester Spy&quot;, and from there it spread across the country. While some commentators viewed it as a protest against marriage itself, others agreed that no woman should resign her legal existence without such formal protest against the despotism that forced her to forgo marriage and motherhood or submit to the degradation in which law placed a married woman. It inspired other couples to make similar protests part of their wedding ceremonies.

=== Keeping her name ===
Stone viewed the tradition of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands as a manifestation of the legal annihilation of a married woman&#x27;s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as &quot;Lucy Stone&quot; or &quot;Lucy Stone – only.&quot; But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as &quot;Lucy Stone Blackwell.&quot; The couple consulted Blackwell&#x27;s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So, while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months, she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents, and she allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she would not be allowed to vote, unless she added &quot;Blackwell&quot; to her signature. This, she refused to do, and so, she was not able to vote. Because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.

=== Children ===
Stone and Blackwell had one daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell, born September 14, 1857, who became a leader of the suffrage movement and wrote the first biography of her mother, &quot;Lucy Stone: Pioneer Woman Suffragist.&quot; In 1859, while the family was living temporarily in Chicago, Stone miscarried and lost a baby boy.

== Waning activism ==
After her marriage, from the summer of 1855 to the summer of 1857, Stone continued a full lecturing, petitioning, and organizing schedule.

In January 1856, Stone was a defense witness in the case of Margaret Garner, a slave of the Gaines family in Kentucky, who had escaped with her husband and children across the frozen Ohio River into the free state of Ohio. When slavecatchers and U.S. Marshalls surrounded her cousin&#x27;s house where the fugitives hid, Garner, reportedly, declared she would kill each of her children, before allowing them to be taken back to Kentucky. Garner&#x27;s defense attorney wanted to test rights Garner might have under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which her owner had used to track her into the free state. However, by legal rules of the day, Garner could not testify, so, Stone testified about Garner&#x27;s sexual exploitation by her new master, as well as to rebut a rumor put forward by the prosecution that Stone gave Garner the child-killing knife so that Garner could kill herself, if she was forced to return to slavery. Stone was referred to by the court as &quot;Mrs. Lucy Stone Blackwell&quot; and was asked if she wanted to defend herself; she preferred to address the assembly off the record after adjournment, saying &quot;...With my own teeth, I would tear open my veins and let the earth drink my blood, rather than wear the chains of slavery. How, then, could I blame her for wishing her child to find freedom with God and the angels, where no chains are?&quot; The Ohio court did not decide the case by referring to the Fugitive Slave Act, but instead, it returned Garner and her family to Gaines, who returned to Kentucky, before any legal decision was issued. This led to outrage among Ohio abolitionists, and Garner&#x27;s surviving daughter died, during the family&#x27;s steamboat journey south, and Garner was sold in New Orleans and died, in bondage, of typhoid fever in Mississippi. 

The birth of her daughter in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of Stone&#x27;s activism. Stone had made preliminary arrangements for the 1857 national convention to be held in Providence, but because she would not be able to attend it, she handed responsibility to Susan B. Anthony and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the Panic of 1857 disrupted Anthony&#x27;s plan to move the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention would be in May 1858. Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.

Stone hired a nursemaid to help care for her daughter, who was in poor health for several years, but she didn&#x27;t trust her ability to provide proper care, when Stone was absent. Stone, eventually, withdrew from most public work to stay at home with her child. She resigned from the Central Committee, which organized the annual women&#x27;s rights conventions. She began to suffer from self-doubt and a lack of drive, in addition to the debilitating headaches that had plagued her for years. She made only two public appearances, during the Civil War (1861–1865): to attend the founding convention of the Women&#x27;s Loyal National League and the celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, both in 1863. Stone began to increase her reform activities back to a normal level, after the Civil War had ended.

As a lifelong believer in nonresistance, Stone could not support the war effort as so many of her friends did. She could certainly support the drive to end slavery, however, which the war had made into a realistic possibility. In 1863, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony organized the Women&#x27;s Loyal National League, the first national women&#x27;s political organization in the U.S. It collected nearly 400,000 signatures on petitions to abolish slavery in the largest petition drive in the nation&#x27;s history up to that time. Despite her reduced public activity, Stone agreed to preside over the League&#x27;s founding convention, and later, she agreed to manage its office for two weeks to give Anthony a badly-needed break. She declined, however, to go on lecture tours for the League.

For years, Henry Blackwell had worked with real estate investments. In 1864, amid wartime inflation, his investments began to pay off, handsomely. Stone was enormously relieved to have the family freed from the debts that had been contracted to buy investment property. This major improvement in the family&#x27;s finances enabled Blackwell to scale back his business efforts and devote more of his time to social reform activities.

Beginning to ease back into public activity, Stone embarked on a lecture tour on women&#x27;s rights in New York and New England, in the autumn of 1865. She was still experiencing periods of self-doubt, a year later, but, with Blackwell&#x27;s encouragement, she traveled with him on a joint lecture tour, in 1866.

== National organizations ==
=== American Equal Rights Association ===

Slavery was abolished in December 1865 with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which raised questions about the future role of the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS). In January 1866, Stone and Anthony traveled to an AASS meeting in Boston to propose a merger of the anti-slavery and women&#x27;s movements into one that would campaign for equal rights for all citizens. The AASS, preferring to focus on the rights of African Americans, especially the newly freed slaves, rejected their proposal.

In May 1866, Anthony and Stanton organized the Eleventh National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention, the first since before the Civil War began.
In a move similar to the proposal that had been made earlier to anti-slavery forces, the convention voted to transform itself into a new organization called the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), whose purpose was to campaign for the equal rights for all, especially the right of suffrage. Stone did not attend the AERA&#x27;s founding convention, most likely for fear of the recent cholera outbreak in New York City, the meeting&#x27;s location. She was, nevertheless, elected to the new organization&#x27;s executive committee. Blackwell was elected as the AERA&#x27;s recording secretary.

In 1867, Stone and Blackwell opened the AERA&#x27;s difficult campaign in Kansas, in support of referendums in that state that would enfranchise both African Americans and women. They led the effort for three months, before turning the work over to others and returning home. Neither of the Kansas referendums was approved by the voters. Disagreements over tactics used during the Kansas campaign contributed to a growing split in the women&#x27;s movement, which was formalized after the AERA convention in 1869.

=== Split within the women&#x27;s movement ===

The immediate cause of the split was the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, which would prohibit the denial of suffrage, because of race. In one of their most controversial moves, Anthony and Stanton campaigned against the amendment, insisting that women and African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time. They said that by effectively enfranchising all men, while excluding all women, the amendment would create an &quot;aristocracy of sex&quot; by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.

Stone supported the amendment. She had expected, however, that progressive forces would push for the enfranchisement of African Americans and women at the same time and was distressed, when they did not. In 1867, she wrote to Abby Kelley Foster, an abolitionist, to protest the plan to enfranchise black men first. &quot;O Abby&quot;, she wrote, &quot;it is a terrible mistake you are all making... There is no other name given by which this country can be saved, but that of woman.&quot;
In a dramatic debate with Frederick Douglass at the AERA convention in 1869, Stone argued that suffrage for women was more important than suffrage for African Americans. She, nevertheless, supported the amendment, saying, &quot;But I thank God for that XV. Amendment, and I hope that it will be adopted in every State. I will be thankful, in my soul, if &quot;any&quot; body can get out of the terrible pit. But I believe that the safety of the government would be more promoted by the admission of woman as an element of restoration and harmony than the negro.&quot; Stone and her allies expected that their active support for the amendment to enfranchise black men would lead their abolitionist friends in Congress to push for an amendment to enfranchise women as the next step, but that did not happen.

Henry Blackwell, Stone&#x27;s husband and an important figure in the suffrage movement in the coming years, also supported the amendment. His special interest, however, which he pursued for decades, was in convincing southern politicians that the enfranchisement of women would help to ensure white supremacy in their region. In 1867, he published an open letter to southern legislatures, assuring them that if both blacks and women were enfranchised, &quot;the political supremacy of your white race will remain unchanged&quot; and &quot;the black race would gravitate, by the law of nature, toward the tropics.&quot; Stone&#x27;s reaction to this idea is unknown.

The AERA essentially collapsed, after its acrimonious convention in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations were created in its aftermath. Two days after the convention, Anthony, Stanton and their allies formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). In November 1869, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and their allies formed the competing American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The AWSA, initially, was the larger of the two organizations, but it declined in strength, during the 1880s.

Even after the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, differences between the two organizations remained. The AWSA worked almost exclusively for women&#x27;s suffrage, while the NWSA initially worked on a wide range of issues, including divorce reform and equal pay for women. The AWSA included both men and women, among its leadership, while the NWSA was led by women. The AWSA worked for suffrage, mostly, at the state level, while the NWSA worked more at the national level. The AWSA cultivated an image of respectability, while the NWSA sometimes used confrontational tactics.

=== Divorce and &quot;free love&quot; ===
In 1870, at the twentieth anniversary celebration of the first National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts, Stanton spoke for three hours, rallying the crowd for women&#x27;s right to divorce. By then, Stone&#x27;s position on the matter had shifted, significantly. Personal differences between Stone and Stanton came to the fore on the issue, with Stone writing &quot;We believe in &quot;marriage for life&quot;, and deprecate all this loose, pestiferous talk in favor of &quot;easy divorce.&quot;&quot; Stone made it clear that those wishing for &quot;free divorce&quot; were not associated with Stone&#x27;s organization AWSA, headed, at that time, by Reverend Henry Ward Beecher. Stone wrote against &#x27;free love:&#x27; &quot;Be not deceived—&quot;free love means free lust.&quot;&quot;

This editorial position would come back to haunt Stone. Also in 1870, Elizabeth Roberts Tilton told her husband Theodore Tilton that she had been carrying on an adulterous relation with his good friend Henry Ward Beecher. Theodore Tilton published an editorial saying that Beecher &quot;has, at a most unseemly time of life, been detected in improper intimacies with certain ladies of his congregation.&quot; Tilton also informed Stanton about the alleged affair, and Stanton passed the information to Victoria Woodhull. Woodhull, a free love advocate, printed innuendo about Beecher, and began to woo Tilton, convincing him to write a book of her life story from imaginative material that she supplied. In 1871, Stone wrote to a friend &quot;my one wish, in regard to Mrs. Woodhull, is that [neither] she, nor her ideas, may be so much as heard of at our meeting.&quot; Woodhull&#x27;s self-serving activities were attracting disapproval from both centrist AWSA and radical NWSA. To divert criticism from herself, Woodhull published a denunciation of Beecher, in 1872, saying that he practiced free love, in private, while speaking out against it, from the pulpit. This caused a sensation in the press and resulted in an inconclusive legal suit and a subsequent formal inquiry lasting well into 1875. The furor over adultery and the friction between various camps of women&#x27;s rights activists took focus away from legitimate political aims. Henry Blackwell wrote to Stone from Michigan, where he was working toward putting woman suffrage into the state constitution, saying &quot;This Beecher-Tilton affair is playing the deuce with [woman suffrage] in Michigan. No chance of success, this year, I fancy.&quot;

== Voting rights ==
In 1870, Stone and Blackwell moved from New Jersey to Dorchester, Massachusetts, which, today, is a neighborhood of Boston, just south of downtown. There, they purchased Pope&#x27;s Hill, a seventeen-room house with extensive grounds and several outbuildings. Many of the town&#x27;s women had been active in the Dorchester Female Anti-Slavery Society, and, by 1870, a number of local women were suffragists.

=== New England Woman Suffrage Association ===

At her new home, Stone worked closely with the New England Woman Suffrage Association (NEWSA), the first major political organization in the U.S., with women&#x27;s suffrage as its goal. Two years earlier, she had traveled to Boston to participate in its founding convention and had been elected to its executive committee. In 1877, she became its president and served in that position, until her death in 1893.

=== &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; ===

In 1870, Stone and Blackwell founded the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, an eight-page weekly newspaper based in Boston. Originally intended, primarily, to voice the concerns of the NEWSA and the AWSA, by the 1880s, it had become an unofficial voice of the suffrage movement, as a whole. Stone edited the journal for the rest of her life, assisted by her husband and their daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell. Stone did not collect a salary for her work on the paper, which required continual financial support. One of her greatest challenges was raising money to keep it going. Its circulation reached a peak of 6,000, although, in 1878, it was 2,000 less than it had been, two years earlier.

After the AWSA and NWSA merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1890, the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; became its official voice and eventually the basis for a newspaper with a much wider circulation. In 1917, at a time when victory for women&#x27;s suffrage was coming closer, Carrie Chapman Catt, leader of the NAWSA, said, &quot;There can be no overestimating the value to the suffrage cause of the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;... The suffrage success of today is not conceivable, without the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;&#x27;s part in it.

=== &quot;The Colorado Lesson&quot; ===

In 1877, Stone was asked by Rachel Foster Avery to come assist Colorado activists in the organization of a popular referendum campaign, with the aim of gaining suffrage for Coloradan women. Together, Stone and Blackwell worked the northern half of the state in late summer, while Susan Anthony traveled the less-promising rough-and-tumble southern half. Patchwork and scattered support was reported by activists, with some areas more receptive. Latino voters proved largely uninterested in voting reform; some of that resistance was blamed on the extreme opposition to the measure voiced by the Roman Catholic bishop of Colorado. All but a handful of politicians in Colorado ignored the measure or actively fought it. Stone concentrated on convincing Denver voters, during the October ballot, but the measure lost, heavily, with 68% voting against it. Married working men showed the greatest support, and young single men the least. Blackwell called it &quot;The Colorado Lesson,” writing that &quot;Woman suffrage can never be carried by a popular vote, without a political party behind it.&quot;

=== School board vote ===
In 1879, after Stone organized a petition by suffragists across the state, Massachusetts women were given strictly delimited voting rights: a woman who could prove the same qualifications as a male voter was allowed to cast her vote for members of the school board. Lucy Stone applied to the voting board in Boston but was required to sign her husband&#x27;s surname as her own. She refused and never participated in that vote.

== Reconciliation ==
In 1887, eighteen years after the rift formed in the American women&#x27;s rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group, for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak, with heart problems and respiratory illness, to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton was president of the new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.
Starting early in January 1891, Carrie Chapman Catt visited Stone, repeatedly, at Pope&#x27;s Hill, for the purpose of learning from Stone about the ways of political organizing. Stone had previously met Catt at an Iowa state woman&#x27;s suffrage convention in October 1889 and had been impressed at her ambition and sense of presence, saying &quot;Mrs. Chapman will be heard from yet, in this movement.&quot; Stone mentored Catt, the rest of that winter, giving her a wealth of information about lobbying techniques and fundraising. Catt, later, used the teaching to good effect in leading the final drive to gain women the vote in 1920.

Catt, Stone, and Blackwell went, together, to the January 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton, and Anthony, the &quot;triumvirate&quot; of women&#x27;s suffrage, were called away from the convention&#x27;s opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen &quot;I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped, as women, in what we try to do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us, as if we had votes.” Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality, in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife&#x27;s property into that of her husband. Stone&#x27;s impromptu speech paled, in comparison to Stanton&#x27;s brilliant outpouring, which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton&#x27;s speech, in its entirety, in the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; as &quot;Solitude of Self&quot;. Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.

== Final appearance ==
In 1892, Stone was convinced to sit for a portrait in sculpture, rendered by Anne Whitney, sculptor and poet. Stone had previously protested the proposed portrait for more than a year, saying that the funds to engage an artist would be better spent on suffrage work. Stone finally yielded to pressure from Frances Willard, the New England Women&#x27;s Club and some of her friends and neighbors in the Boston area, and sat while Whitney produced a bust. In February 1893, Stone invited her brother Frank and his wife Sarah to come see the bust, before it was shipped to Chicago for display at the upcoming World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition.

Stone went with her daughter to Chicago in May 1893 and gave her last public speeches at the World&#x27;s Congress of Representative Women where she saw a strong international involvement in women&#x27;s congresses, with almost 500 women from 27 countries speaking at 81 meetings, and attendance topping 150,000 at the week-long event. Stone&#x27;s immediate focus was on state referendums under consideration in New York and Nebraska. Stone presented a speech she had prepared entitled &quot;The Progress of Fifty Years&quot; wherein she described the milestones of change, and said &quot;I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do not and can never know at what price their right to free speech and to speak at all in public has been earned.&quot; Stone met with Carrie Chapman Catt and Abigail Scott Duniway to form a plan for organizing in Colorado, and Stone attended two days of meetings about getting a woman suffrage drive restarted in Kansas. Stone and her daughter returned home to Pope&#x27;s Hill on May 28.

Those who knew Stone well thought her voice was lacking strength. In August when she and her husband Harry wanted to take part in more meetings at the Exposition, she was too weak to go. Stone was diagnosed as suffering from advanced stomach cancer in September. She wrote final letters to friends and relatives. Having &quot;prepared for death with serenity and an unwavering concern for the women&#x27;s cause&quot;, Lucy Stone died on October 18, 1893, at the age of 75. At her funeral three days later, 1,100 people crowded the church, and hundreds more stood silently outside. Six women and six men served as pallbearers, including sculptor Anne Whitney, and Stone&#x27;s old abolitionist friends Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Samuel Joseph May. Mourners lined the streets for a sight of the funeral procession, and front-page banner headlines ran in news accounts. Stone&#x27;s death was the most widely reported of any American woman&#x27;s up to that time.

According to her wishes, her body was cremated, making her the first person cremated in Massachusetts, though a wait of over two months was undertaken while the crematorium at Forest Hills Cemetery could be completed. Stone&#x27;s remains are interred at Forest Hills; a chapel there is named after her.

== Legacy ==

Lucy Stone&#x27;s refusal to take her husband&#x27;s name, as an assertion of her own rights, was controversial, then, and it is largely what she is remembered for, today. Women who continue to use their maiden name, after marriage, are still occasionally known as &quot;Lucy Stoners,&quot; in the United States. In 1921, the Lucy Stone League was founded in New York City by Ruth Hale, described in 1924 by &quot;Time&quot; as the &quot;&#x27;Lucy Stone&#x27;-spouse&quot; of Heywood Broun. The League was re-instituted in 1997.
Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Matilda Joslyn Gage, and Ida Husted Harper began, in 1876, to write the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;. They planned for one volume but finished four, before the death of Anthony in 1906, and they completed two more, afterward. The first three volumes chronicled the beginnings of the women&#x27;s rights movement, including the years that Stone was active. Because of differences between Stone and Stanton that had been highlighted in the schism between NWSA and AWSA, Stone&#x27;s place in history was marginalized in the work. The text was used as the standard scholarly resource on 19th-century U.S. feminism, for much of the 20th century, causing Stone&#x27;s extensive contribution to be overlooked, in many histories of women&#x27;s causes.

On August 13, 1968, the 150th anniversary of her birth, the U.S. Postal Service honored Stone with a 50¢ postage stamp in the Prominent Americans series. The image was adapted from a photograph included in Alice Stone Blackwell&#x27;s biography of Stone.

In 1986, Stone was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 1999, a series of six tall marble panels with a bronze bust, in each, was added to the Massachusetts State House; the busts are of Stone, Florence Luscomb, Mary Kenney O&#x27;Sullivan, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, Sarah Parker Remond, and Dorothea Dix. As well, two quotations from each of those women (including Stone) are etched on their own marble panel, and the wall behind all the panels has wallpaper made of six government documents, repeated, over and over, with each document being related to a cause of one or more of the women.

In 2000, Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls included a song entitled &quot;Lucystoners&quot; on her first solo recording, &quot;Stag&quot;.

An administration and classroom building on Livingston Campus at Rutgers University in New Jersey is named for Lucy Stone. Warren, Massachusetts contains a Lucy Stone Park, along the Quaboag River. Anne Whitney&#x27;s 1893 bust of Lucy Stone is on display in Boston&#x27;s Faneuil Hall building.
She is featured on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

On September 19, 2018, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced the name of the fifth ship of a six unit construction contract as USNS &quot;Lucy Stone&quot; (T-AO 209). This ship will be part of the latest &quot;John Lewis&quot;-class of Fleet Replenishment Oilers, named in honor of U.S. civil and human rights heroes currently under construction at General Dynamics NASSCO in San Diego, CA.

== Home ==
Stone&#x27;s birthplace, the Lucy Stone Home Site, is owned and managed by The Trustees of Reservations, a non-profit land conservation and historic preservation organization dedicated to preserving natural and historic places in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The site includes 61 acres of forested land on the side of Coys Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. Although the farmhouse in which Stone was born and married burned to the ground in 1950, its ruins are at the center of the property. At the time of Stone&#x27;s wedding, both her parents and a married brother and his family lived in the two-and-one-half-story house, and family descendants continued to live there until 1936. In 1915, a pilgrimage of suffragists placed a memorial tablet on the house, which read: &quot;This house was the birthplace of Lucy Stone, pioneer advocate of equal rights for women. Born August 13, 1818. Married May 1, 1855, died October 18, 1893. In grateful memory Massachusetts suffragists placed this tablet August 13, 1915.&quot; That tablet, severely damaged but surviving the 1950 fire, is now in the Quaboag Historical Society Museum. After the fire, the surrounding farmland was abandoned and left to revert to forest, and it is now used for hunting and harvesting timber. The Trustees acquired the home site in 2002 and have been maintaining the property ever since.

<text>László Papp (25 March 1926 – 16 October 2003) was a Hungarian professional boxer from Budapest. He was left-handed and won gold medals in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, and the 1956 Summer Olympics held in Melbourne, Australia. In his final Olympic competition he became the first boxer in Olympic history to win three successive gold medals. He won 12 of his 13 Olympic fights without losing a round, dropping only one, in his last Olympic final, to American boxer José Torres. 
There was not another triple gold medalist for 20 years, when Cuba&#x27;s Teófilo Stevenson won three, followed by another Cuban Félix Savón as the third of the three men to accomplish the feat.

==Amateur career==
Papp was an Olympic gold medalist three times, at middleweight in London in 1948, then as a light middleweight in Helsinki in 1952 and in Melbourne in 1956. Papp also was the European amateur middleweight champion as a middleweight in 1949 at Oslo and at light middleweight at Milan in 1951. He scored 55 first-round knockouts as an amateur, his record was 301-12-6.

===Olympic results===
1948 London (England)
*Defeated Valfrid Resko (Finland) KO 2
*Defeated Jean Welter (Luxembourg) KO 1
*Defeated Auguste Cavignac (Belgium) KO 1
*Defeated Ivano Fontana (Italy) 3-0
*Defeated John Wright (England) 3-0

1952 Helsinki (Finland)
*Defeated Ellsworth Webb (United States) KO 2
*Defeated Charlie Chase (Canada) KO 2
*Defeated Petar Stankoff Spassoff (Bulgaria) 3-0
*Defeated Eladio Oscar Herrera (Argentina) 3-0
*Defeated Theunis Jacobus van Schalkwyk (South Africa) 3-0

1956 Melbourne (Australia)
*Defeated Alberto Saenz (Argentina) KO 3
*Defeated Zbigniew Pietrzykowski (Poland) 3-0
*Defeated José Torres (USA) 2-1

==Professional career==
Papp, despite having hand trouble, turned professional in 1957 and immediately began rising in the Middleweight ranks. However, Hungary was a Communist country at the time and professional boxing was not permitted. Papp had to travel to Vienna, in Austria, for training and for his fights. In spite of this disadvantage, he beat several top-ranking contenders for the European Middleweight title, including veteran Tiger Jones, French champion Hippolyte Annex and Chris Christensen. After Christensen, Papp defeated Randy Sandy of the United States. In 1964, after Papp had already signed up for the world championship title bout against Joey Giardello, Hungary&#x27;s Communist leadership brought his professional career to an end by denying him an exit visa.

Papp is one of the few boxers in history to ever retire undefeated in the ring. His fighting record was 27 wins, 2 draws, and no losses. 15 of his wins were by way of knockout.

==Death==
László Papp died in Budapest in 2003.

==Honours==
Papp was inducted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in 2001.
In 1989 WBC President José Sulaimán gave Papp an award for &#x27;Best amateur and professional boxer of all time&#x27; and granted him honorary champion status of the World Boxing Council.

<doc id="161161" wikidata="Q1139957" url="?curid=161161" title="2003 Cricket World Cup">
<text>The 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup was the eighth Cricket World Cup, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya from 9 February to 23 March 2003. This edition of the World Cup was the first to be played in Africa. The tournament featured 14 teams, the largest number in the World Cup&#x27;s history at the time, playing a total of 54 matches. It followed the format introduced in the 1999 Cricket World Cup, with the teams divided into two groups, and the top three in each group qualifying for the Super Sixes stage.

The tournament saw numerous upsets, with South Africa, Pakistan, West Indies and England all being eliminated at the group stage (South Africa missed by 1 run after misreading the Duckworth-Lewis method rules). England forfeited their match with Zimbabwe, due to the political unrest in the country, which ultimately enabled that team to reach the Super Sixes. Similarly, New Zealand forfeited their match with Kenya, due to security reasons which enabled the latter to reach the semi-finals, the only non-Test playing nation to do so. Another shock wave came two days after the tournament had started, when Shane Warne, at the time one of the game&#x27;s leading spinners, was sent home in disgrace after testing positive for a banned substance.

The tournament was eventually won by Australia who won all 11 of their matches, beating India in the final played at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. This was Australia&#x27;s third World Cup win, the only team to do so. Pakistani player Shoaib Akhtar also set a world record, becoming the fastest bowler in the history of cricket, delivering a record top speed of 161.3km/h (100.23 mph) in a pool match against England.

==Teams and squads==

Fourteen teams played in the 2003 World Cup, the largest number of teams to play in a Cricket World Cup at the time. The 10 Test playing nations automatically qualified for the tournament including the recently appointed member Bangladesh, while Kenya also qualified automatically due to their full One Day International status. The other three spots were filled by the top three teams in the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada, which served as a qualifying tournament. These teams were, respectively, the Netherlands who won the ICC Trophy, Canada and Namibia. This was Namibia&#x27;s World Cup debut, while the Netherlands and Canada were both appearing in the tournament for the second time, having previously appeared in 1996 and 1979 respectively.

The format used in the 1999 World Cup was retained, with the 14 teams divided into two groups of seven, and the top three from each group qualifying for the Super Sixes stage, carrying forward the results they had achieved against other qualifiers from their group. The top four teams in the Super Sixes qualified for the semi-finals, and the winners of those matches contested the final.
==Host cities and venues==

==Knockout stage==

===Bracket===
===Semi-finals===
====Semi-final 1====

On a difficult, slow pitch at Port Elizabeth, Australia struggled their way to 212/7 against tight Sri Lankan bowling, thanks mainly to a great innings from Andrew Symonds (91* from 118 balls, 7 fours, 1 six), demonstrating again captain Ricky Ponting&#x27;s faith in him. Chaminda Vaas, continuing his excellent tournament, took three wickets. Australia&#x27;s pace attack then ripped through the Sri Lankan top order, with Brett Lee (3/35 in 8 overs) taking three early wickets and Glenn McGrath (1/20 in 7 overs) taking one. By the time rain arrived in the 39th over, continued tight bowling had squeezed Sri Lanka to 123/7, well behind the target given by the Duckworth–Lewis method. This is the match in which Adam Gilchrist famously &quot;walked&quot; despite being given not out.

====Semi-final 2====

The fairytale ended for the Kenyan team, the only non-Test-playing nation to ever make a World Cup semi-final. Sachin Tendulkar (83 from 101 balls, 5 fours, 1 six) and Sourav Ganguly (111 from 114 balls, 5 fours, 5 sixes), batted the Kenyans out of the game as India reached a total of 270/4. Under the Durban lights, the potent Indian seam attack of Zaheer Khan (3/14 in 9.2 overs), the experienced Javagal Srinath (1/11 in 7 overs) and Ashish Nehra (2/11 in 5 overs) ripped through the Kenyan top order. Kenya were bowled out for 179, with only Steve Tikolo (56 from 83 balls, 5 fours, 2 sixes) putting up any significant resistance.

===Final===


India won the toss, and Ganguly, elected to field, hoping to take advantage of a pitch left damp by dew and rain. On a lively Wanderers Stadium pitch, the Australian openers took advantage of very wayward Indian opening bowlers to get off to a flying start. Adam Gilchrist (57 from 48 balls, 8 fours, 1 six) and Matthew Hayden (37 from 54 balls, 5 fours) shared an opening partnership of 105 runs in 14 overs, forcing Ganguly to bring on the spinners unusually early. The change of pace brought wickets with Adam Gilchrist, who had been swinging at everything, holing out off a sweep shot from the bowling of Harbhajan Singh. Matthew Hayden, looking somewhat better than he had throughout the tournament, soon followed for 37, leaving Australia at 2/125 Captain Ricky Ponting (140 from 121 balls, 4 fours, 8 sixes) and Damien Martyn (88 from 84 balls, 7 fours, 1 six), playing with a broken thumb, completing a partnership of 234 runs in 30.1 overs, an Australian record for one-day cricket. Ponting and Martyn started efficiently, putting away bad balls but mostly keeping the scoring going with good running, then letting loose in the last ten overs, taking 109 from them. Ponting in particular dispatched the bowling over the fence with fearsome regularity in scoring 8 sixes, the most from one batsman in any World Cup match at the time. The final Australian total of 359 (2 wickets, 50 overs), at a run rate of 7.18 runs an over, was their then highest ever in ODI history.

India&#x27;s run chase was made even more difficult after their best batsman, Sachin Tendulkar, was out in the first over after skying a pull shot, Glenn McGrath completing the caught and bowled. Nevertheless, Virender Sehwag&#x27;s (82 from 81 balls, 10 fours, 3 sixes) run-a-ball half century gave India respectability as they maintained a high scoring rate. Their only realistic hope—a washout—looked a possibility as the game was interrupted by rain with India at 3/103 after 17 overs. However, this rain passed by, and India&#x27;s hopes were dashed when Sehwag was run out by Darren Lehmann, and again when Rahul Dravid (47 from 57 balls, 2 fours) was bowled by Andy Bichel, ending their partnership of 88 runs in 13.2 overs. India&#x27;s batsmen continued to throw wickets away in the chase as the run rate crept up past 7 an over, and they were finally bowled out for 234 (all out, 39.2 overs) at a run rate of 5.97 runs an over giving Australia an emphatic victory by a record margin (in World Cup finals thus far) of 125 runs, underlining their dominance of the tournament. Ponting was named &quot;Man of the Match&quot;, and Sachin Tendulkar was named &quot;Player of the Series.&quot;

==Controversies==
===Security issues in Zimbabwe and Kenya===
The security and political situation in Zimbabwe, and the appropriateness of playing there given the misdeeds of the regime of Robert Mugabe was a point of concern before the tournament. Two Zimbabwean players, Andy Flower and Henry Olonga wore black armbands in their opening game protesting against the undemocratic rule in Zimbabwe. Both men subsequently retired from Zimbabwean cricket, and began playing overseas. England faced a great deal of domestic pressure to boycott their match in Zimbabwe on political grounds and did not play, citing fears for the players&#x27; safety. The boycott proved costly, as Zimbabwe advanced to the Super Sixes, just 2 points ahead of England, from the 4 points they achieved from the walkover. Similarly, New Zealand decided against playing in Kenya because of security fears which would ultimately cost New Zealand a semifinal spot.

===Shane Warne&#x27;s drug test===
Australian star player Shane Warne was sent home from the cup in embarrassing circumstances, only the day before their opening game, after a positive drug test in a lead-up competition in Australia revealed that he had taken a banned diuretic. The leg spinner claimed that he had taken a &#x27;fluid pill&#x27; on the advice of his mother.

<doc id="161176" wikidata="Q213369" url="?curid=161176" title="Webcomic">
<text>Webcomics (also known as online comics or Internet comics) are comics published on the internet, such as on a website or a mobile app. While many webcomics are published exclusively online, others are also published in magazines, newspapers, or comic books.
Webcomics can be compared to self-published print comics in that anyone with an Internet connection can publish their own webcomic. Readership levels vary widely; many are read only by the creator&#x27;s immediate friends and family, while some of the most widely read have audiences of well over one million readers. Webcomics range from traditional comic strips and graphic novels to avant garde comics, and cover many genres, styles, and subjects. They sometimes take on the role of a comic blog. The term web cartoonist is sometimes used to refer to someone who creates webcomics.

==Medium==
There are several differences between webcomics and print comics. With webcomics the restrictions of traditional books, newspapers or magazines can be lifted, allowing artists and writers to take advantage of the web&#x27;s unique capabilities.

===Styles===
The creative freedom webcomics provide allows artists to work in nontraditional styles. Clip art or photo comics (also known as fumetti) are two types of webcomics that do not use traditional artwork. &quot;A Softer World&quot;, for example, is made by overlaying photographs with strips of typewriter-style text. As in the constrained comics tradition, a few webcomics, such as &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; by Ryan North, are created with most strips having art copied exactly from one (or a handful of) template comics and only the text changing. Pixel art, such as that created by Richard Stevens of &quot;Diesel Sweeties&quot;, is similar to that of sprite comics but instead uses low-resolution images created by the artist themself. However, it is also common for some artists to use traditional styles, similar to those typically published in newspapers or comic books.

===Content===
Webcomics that are independently published are not subject to the content restrictions of book publishers or newspaper syndicates, enjoying an artistic freedom similar to underground and alternative comics. Some webcomics stretch the boundaries of taste, taking advantage of the fact that Internet censorship is virtually nonexistent in countries like the United States. The content of webcomics can still cause problems, such as &quot;Leisure Town&quot; artist Tristan Farnon&#x27;s legal trouble after creating a profane &quot;Dilbert&quot; parody, or the Catholic League&#x27;s protest of artist Eric Millikin&#x27;s &quot;blasphemous treatment of Jesus.&quot;

===Format===
Webcomic artists use many formats throughout the world. Comic strips, generally consisting of three or four panels, have been a common format for many artists. Other webcomic artists use the format of traditional printed comic books and graphic novels, sometimes with the plan of later publishing books.

Scott McCloud, an early advocate of webcomics since 1998, pioneered the idea of the &quot;infinite canvas&quot; where, rather than being confined to normal print dimensions, artists are free to spread out in any direction indefinitely with their comics. Such a format proved highly successful in South-Korean webcomics when JunKoo Kim implemented an infinite scrolling mechanism in the platform Webtoon in 2004. In 2009, French web cartoonist Balak described Turbomedia, a format for webcomics where a reader only views one panel at a time, in which the reader decides their own reading rhythm by going forward one panel at a time. Some web cartoonists, such as political cartoonist Mark Fiore or Charley Parker with &quot;Argon Zark!&quot;, incorporate animations or interactive elements into their webcomics.

==History==

The first comics to be shared through the Internet were Eric Millikin&#x27;s &quot;Witches and Stitches&quot;, which he started uploading on CompuServe in 1985. Services such as CompuServe and Usenet were used before the World Wide Web started to rise in popularity in 1993. Early webcomics were often derivatives from strips in college newspapers, but when the Web became widely popular in the mid-1990s, more people started creating comics exclusively for this medium. By 2000, various webcomic creators were financially successful and webcomics became more artistically recognized. Unique genres and styles became popular during this period.

The 2010s also saw the rise of webtoons in South Korea, where the form has become very prominent. This decade had also seen an increasingly larger number of successful webcomics being adapted into animated series in China and Japan.

==Webcomics collectives==
In March 1995, artist Bebe Williams launched one of the first webcomics collectives, Art Comics Daily. Newspaper comic strip syndicates also launched websites in the mid-1990s.

Other webcomics collectives followed, with many launching in the next decade. In March 2000, Chris Crosby, Crosby&#x27;s mother Teri, and other artists founded Keenspot. In July 2000, Austin Osueke launched eigoMANGA, publishing original online manga, referred to as &quot;webmanga&quot;.

In 2001, the subscription webcomics site Cool Beans World was launched. Contributors included UK-based comic book creators Pat Mills, Simon Bisley, John Bolton, and Kevin O&#x27;Neill, and the author Clive Barker. Serialised content included &quot;Scarlet Traces&quot; and &quot;Marshal Law&quot;.

In March 2001, Shannon Denton and Patrick Coyle launched Komikwerks.com serving free strips from comics and animation professionals. The site launched with 9 titles including Steve Conley&#x27;s &quot;Astounding Space Thrills&quot;, Jason Kruse&#x27;s &quot;The World of Quest&quot;, and Bernie Wrightson&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Expeditions&quot;.

On March 2, 2002, Joey Manley founded Modern Tales, offering subscription-based webcomics. The Modern Tales spin-off serializer followed in October 2002, then came girlamatic and Graphic Smash in March and September 2003 respectively.

By 2005, webcomics hosting had become a business in its own right, with sites such as Webcomics Nation.

Traditional comic book publishers, such as Marvel Comics and Slave Labour Graphics, did not begin making serious digital efforts until 2006 and 2007. DC Comics launched its web comic imprint, Zuda Comics in October 2007. The site featured user submitted comics in a competition for a professional contract to produce web comics. In July 2010, it was announced that DC was closing down Zuda.

==Business==

Some creators of webcomics are able to do so professionally through various revenue channels. Webcomic artists may sell merchandise based on their work, such as T-shirts and toys, or they may sell print versions or compilations of their webcomic. Webcomic creators can also sell online advertisements on their websites. In the second half of the 2000s, webcomics became less financially sustainable due to the rise of social media and consumers&#x27; disinterest in certain kinds of merchandise. Crowdfunding through Kickstarter and Patreon have also become sources of income for web cartoonists.

Webcomics have been used by some cartoonists as a path towards syndication in newspapers. Since the mid-1990s, Scott McCloud advocated for micropayments systems as a source of income for web cartoonists, but micropayment systems have not been popular with artists or readers.

==Awards==
Many webcomics artists have received honors for their work. In 2006, Gene Luen Yang&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;American Born Chinese&quot;, originally published as a webcomic on Modern Tales, was the first graphic novel to be nominated for a National Book Award. Don Hertzfeldt&#x27;s animated film based on his webcomics, &quot;Everything Will Be OK&quot;, won the 2007 Sundance Film Festival Jury Award in Short Filmmaking, a prize rarely bestowed on an animated film.

Many traditionally print-comics focused organizations have added award categories for comics published on the web. The Eagle Awards established a Favorite Web-based Comic category in 2000, and the Ignatz Awards followed the next year by introducing an Outstanding Online Comic category in 2001. After having nominated webcomics in several of their traditional print-comics categories, the Eisner Awards began awarding comics in the Best Digital Comic category in 2005. In 2006 the Harvey Awards established a Best Online Comics Work category, and in 2007 the Shuster Awards began an Outstanding Canadian Web Comic Creator Award. In 2012 the National Cartoonists Society gave their first Reuben Award for &quot;On-line comic strips.&quot;

Other awards focus exclusively on webcomics. The Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Awards consist of a number of awards that were handed out annually from 2001 to 2008. The Dutch Clickburg Webcomic Awards (also known as the Clickies) has been handed out four times between 2005 and 2010. The awards require the recipient to be active in the Benelux countries, with the exception of one international award.

==Webcomics in print==
Though webcomics are typically published primarily on the World Wide Web, often webcomic creators decide to also print self-published books of their work. In some cases, web cartoonists may get publishing deals in which comic books are created of their work. Sometimes, these books are published by mainstream comics publishers who are traditionally aimed at the direct market of comic books stores. Some web cartoonists may pursue print syndication in established newspapers or magazines.

The traditional audience base for webcomics and print comics are vastly different, and webcomic readers do not necessarily go to bookstores. For some web cartoonists, a print release may be considered the &quot;goal&quot; of a webcomic series, while for others, comic books are &quot;just another way to get the content out.&quot; Webcomics have been seen by some artists as a potential new path towards syndication in newspapers. According to Jeph Jacques (&quot;Questionable Content&quot;), &quot;there&#x27;s no real money&quot; in syndication for webcomic artists. Some artists are not able to syndicate their work in newspapers because their comics are targeted to a specific niche audience and would not be popular with a broader readership.

==Non-anglophone webcomics==
Many webcomics are published primarily in English, this being a major language in Australia, Canada, India, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Cultures surrounding non-anglophone webcomics have thrived in countries such as China, France, India, Japan, and South Korea.

Webcomics have been a popular medium in India since the early 2000s. Indian webcomics are successful as they reach a large audience for free and they are frequently used by the country&#x27;s younger generation to spread social awareness on topics such as politics and feminism. These webcomics achieve a large amount of exposure by being spread through social media.

In China, Chinese webcomics have become a popular way to criticize the communist government and politicians in the country. Many webcomics by popular artists get shared around the country thanks to social networks such as Sina Weibo and WeChat. Many titles will often be censored or taken down by the government.

<doc id="161185" wikidata="Q236482" url="?curid=161185" title="Adrienne Clarkson">
<text>Adrienne Louise Clarkson (; ; born February 10, 1939) is a Hong Kong–born Canadian journalist and stateswoman who served as the 26th governor general of Canada from 1999 to 2005.

Clarkson arrived in Canada with her family in 1941, as a refugee from Japanese-occupied Hong Kong, and was raised in Ottawa. After receiving a number of university degrees, Clarkson worked as a producer and broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and a journalist for various magazines. Her first diplomatic posting came in the early 1980s, when she promoted Ontarian culture in France and other European countries. In 1999, she was appointed Governor General by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien, to replace Roméo LeBlanc as viceroy, a post which she occupied until 2005, when she was succeeded by Michaëlle Jean. While Clarkson&#x27;s appointment as the Canadian vicereine was generally welcomed at first, she caused some controversy during her time serving as the Queen&#x27;s representative, mostly due to costs incurred in the operation of her office, as well as a somewhat anti-monarchist attitude toward the position.

On October 3, 2005, Clarkson was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. She subsequently published her memoirs, founded the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, and became Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry.

==Early life and education==
Clarkson is a Chinese Canadian whose ancestry lies from the Taishanese (paternal line) and Hakka (maternal line) peoples in Guangdong, China. Her paternal grandfather () immigrated in the late 19th century to Chiltern, Australia. There, he operated a general store called &quot;Willie Ah Poy Fruitier and Confectioner&quot;, &quot;Ah Poy&quot; being his name in the vocative, based on the Taishanese pronunciation, and what Australian immigration officials heard Poy enunciate in response to their request for his name. Poy&#x27;s first son, William, was born in Victoria but was later sent back to Taishan, from where he made his way to Hong Kong. There, he worked with his father for the Canadian government and met and married Ethel Poy, with whom he had two children: Neville, born October 29, 1934, and Adrienne, born February 10, 1939. The elder went on to become a plastic surgeon in Toronto and married Vivienne Lee, who herself became a Senator.

Clarkson describes one of her earliest memories as that of hiding in several Hong Kong basements during the Japanese invasion of the territory in 1941. It was only through his Canadian government connections that her father gained his family the opportunity in 1942 to flee the occupation to Canada, as part of the repatriating of Canadian government staff from the fallen city. Even so, the Chinese Immigration Act, 1923, prevented the Poys&#x27; immediate entry into the country until the Department of External Affairs intervened and cited an unfilled quota in the prisoner of war exchange programme with the Japanese Imperial Forces that would permit the Poy family free passage into Canada. The family settled in Ottawa, though William had lost almost all of his substantial fortune, and the Poys lived in a cramped duplex. Clarkson attended public school in the city and, in October 1951, was lined up with her class to see Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), as the royal motorcade passed through the city.

Clarkson graduated from Lisgar Collegiate Institute in 1956, afterwards enrolling at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Trinity College. During her time there, Clarkson won a Governor General&#x27;s Medal in English before graduating in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honours in the subject, and then travelling with her parents to East and Southeast Asia. Clarkson went on to obtain her master&#x27;s degree in English literature, also at the University of Toronto. She began post-graduate work in 1962, at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, with a thesis on the poems of George Meredith.

==Journalism==
After being introduced by a college friend in 1965 to the producers of &quot;Take 30&quot;—an afternoon variety show run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)—Clarkson was hired by the Crown corporation as a freelance book reviewer. This marked the start of her nearly 30-year career with the CBC, as, after less than a year in her initial position, Clarkson was promoted to co-host, thus becoming one of the first members of a visible minority to obtain a prominent position on Canadian television. She remained with &quot;Take 30&quot; for a decade, while also branching into print journalism by becoming a regular contributor to such publications as &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Chatelaine&quot;. Similarly, Clarkson wrote and published her own romantic fiction novels: &quot;A Lover More Condoling&quot; in 1968, and &quot;Hunger Trace&quot; in 1970. Beyond these, her non-fiction book &quot;True to You in My Fashion: A Woman Talks to Men About Marriage&quot;—a collection of interviews with men on the subject of divorce—was published in 1971, during which time her first marriage had hit a hard patch.

In 1974, Clarkson began her own public affairs television show &quot;Adrienne at Large&quot;, though this was not particularly successful and lasted less than four months. The series did, however, allow her to travel extensively outside of Canada, as she recorded segments for the show in locations such as South Africa (where she interviewed Nadine Gordimer and Helen Suzman), and her native Hong Kong. With the cancellation of the show, the CBC created in 1975 the hard journalism programme &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; as a means for meeting Canadian content requirements. Clarkson was brought on to co-host with Warner Troyer for the first season, but, due to persistent problems between the two, Troyer left the series, leaving Clarkson to host with Peter Reilly and Eric Malling thereafter. She focused on investigative journalism and gained prominence after an in-depth study of the McCain family&#x27;s business practices led a Senator to publicly accuse her of being un-naturalised.

After winning several ACTRA Awards, Clarkson ended her job with &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; in 1983 and was subsequently appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, John Black Aird, on the advice of his Premier, William Davis, as the Agent General for Ontario in France, acting in this role as a cultural liaison between the province and the country, as well as promoting Ontario in several other European states. After five years at this post, she returned to private business, becoming president and publisher of McClelland and Stewart, at a time when the publisher was in financial difficulty. Clarkson was not only unsuccessful at improving the company&#x27;s fiscal problems, she was also highly unpopular with employees, and resigned herself after 18 months that saw several protest resignations; the imprint &quot;Adrienne Clarkson Books&quot; does, however, remain with McClelland and Stewart.

Clarkson opted to return to television, hosting through mid-1988 &quot;Adrienne Clarkson Summer Festival&quot;, which became popular enough to be picked up and repackaged as &quot;Adrienne Clarkson Presents&quot;, an arts show that was critically acclaimed, but which never received high ratings. After four years of hosting the show, Clarkson was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada for her long media career, which included hosting more than 3,500 television programmes, as well as assisting charitable organisations, such as the Kidney Foundation of Canada, Horizons of Canada, and International PEN. Further, as host and executive producer of &quot;Adrienne Clarkson Presents&quot;, she received numerous Gemini Award nominations—winning in 1993 for best host in a light information, variety, or performing arts programme or series—and was the 1995 recipient of the Donald Brittain Award, a special honour given every year for the best social/political documentary programme. In the same year, she also won a Gémeaux Award (the French language equivalent of a Gemini) for &quot;Adrienne Clarkson Presents&quot;. Her precise diction and sometimes haughty demeanour did sometimes become the occasional subject of satire, however; most famously in the CBC Radio series &quot;Double Exposure&quot;, where co-creator Linda Cullen mimicked Clarkson with the line: &quot;I&#x27;m Adrienne Clarkson, and you&#x27;re not&quot; (derived from Chevy Chase&#x27;s early &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; refrain).

Throughout the 1990s—during which time she also wrote and produced films, such as &quot;The Lust In His Eye: Visions of James Wilson Morrice&quot; and &quot;Borduas and Me and Artemisia&quot;—there was much speculation that Clarkson would soon be given a high level appointment by the Queen-in-Council. This was finally realized in 1995 when Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and then Minister of Canadian Heritage Michel Dupuy advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to appoint Clarkson as chair of the board of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, and later, to the Canadian War Museum as well, all while she continued to host her show. It was during this time that the War Museum announced the decision to build the structure which now houses its collection, and which Clarkson opened as Governor General in May 2005.

==Governor General of Canada==
Clarkson was the first visible minority and refugee to be appointed governor general, and the second woman (after Jeanne Sauvé), the first Chinese Canadian, and the first without a military or political background. She was also the second person to have been appointed to the Order of Canada prior to nomination as governor general-designate, after Jules Léger. Clarkson brought with her a new approach to the governor generalcy, and dedicated much of her self-imposed mandate to drawing national attention to Northern Canada.

===As governor general-designate===
It was on September 8, 1999, announced from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada that Queen Elizabeth II had approved Prime Minister Jean Chrétien&#x27;s choice of Clarkson to succeed Roméo LeBlanc as the Queen&#x27;s representative. 
The commission appointing Clarkson was issued on September 28 under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada. At the time of the announcement of her appointment, it was revealed that, with Clarkson being accompanied to Rideau Hall by her longtime partner, John Ralston Saul, the official appointment would be bringing an unofficial pair to the viceregal post, in that the governor general would not be the only person actively exploring Canadian theory and culture.

===In office===
====Bond with the military====
On October 8, 1999, Clarkson was sworn in as the 26th Governor General of Canada, and was soon actively participating in her role, becoming immediately instrumental in the final stages of the repatriation of Canada&#x27;s unknown soldier from France. Her eulogy read at the tomb&#x27;s dedication ceremony on May 28, 2000, was described by the Royal Canadian Legion as &quot;powerful&quot;, and led journalist John Fraser to state: &quot;You have to go back pretty far to find anyone who stirred national emotions the way Clarkson did with her magnificent speech...&quot; In the same vein, after a decade of inaction on the part of the Cabinet, Clarkson moved to have Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry honoured with the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Unit Commendation, on behalf of the Queen, beginning a long relationship between Clarkson and the regiment.

Following the terrorist attacks United States on September 11, 2001, Clarkson praised Operation Yellow Ribbon, saying &quot;communities across the country selflessly opened their homes and hearts to stranded air travellers&quot;, and, on September 14, 2001, presided over a memorial service on Parliament Hill for the victims of the attacks, which was attended by over 100,000 people—the largest single vigil ever seen in Canada&#x27;s capital. On her cabinet&#x27;s advice, Clarkson subsequently dispatched Canadian soldiers to assist in the invasion of Afghanistan, and, in her role of representing the Queen as commander-in-chief of the Canadian Forces, visited in 2002 the Canadian troops serving in the Afghan theatre. This trip, plus similar ones she undertook during her tenure—such as those to Kosovo to meet with Canadian troops, to the Persian Gulf to spend Christmas with members of the Armed Forces on a Canadian destroyer, and again to Afghanistan to spend New Year&#x27;s with Canadian soldiers—won her acclaim for being the first governor general since at least 1945 to take seriously the duties associated with the commander-in-chief title, which was credited for helping to boost pride in the Canadian Forces.

====More robust viceregal office====
Clarkson took a proactive role in increasing the stature of the Canadian viceregal office, travelling widely, hosting lavish state events, and hosting conferences and forums. However, criticism soon ensued over the way her office was spending Crown funds, as, during her tenure, expenditures at Rideau Hall increased 200%; the budget for 2003 was estimated at CAD$41 million. Part of this increase was due to accounting reasons; some costs that had previously been worked into the budgets of ministries were transferred to the governor general&#x27;s office. But, the event that the media mostly focused on was Clarkson&#x27;s 2003, 19-day circumpolar &quot;northern identity&quot; tour, which included state visits to Russia, Finland, and Iceland, and the attendance of 50 other Canadians prominent in the fields of arts, culture, and science. In an atmosphere tainted by several spending scandals in the government, the trip&#x27;s estimated CAD$1 million cost was attacked as a waste of money. All together, this resulted in some politicians calling for the role of the governor general to be reduced or even for the position to be eliminated, and a poll taken late in 2003 found a majority of respondents thought Clarkson was &quot;too grand&quot; for the office. In an unprecedented move for a vicereine, Clarkson, and not her ministers, personally addressed the controversy, explaining that she had been asked to undertake the state visits by her prime minister. Still, though the Office of the Governor General defended the tour as successful, particularly with regard to the warm reception Clarkson received in Russia and during her meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and it was the Department of Foreign Affairs that commissioned and paid for the trip with funds approved by parliament. When the end cost for the trips came in at CAD$5 million, a scheduled continuation of the tour that would have included visits to Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Greenland was scrapped by the federal government in early 2004. John Fraser later stated Prime Minister Paul Martin left Clarkson to defend herself because he &quot;clearly didn&#x27;t like her very much&quot; and &quot;even if it was Madam Clarkson&#x27;s (and John Ralston Saul&#x27;s) own imaginative idea, it had been officially supported by the government, and no appointed high official should ever be abandoned like that. Not only should she have been defended publicly, we were made to look foolish in the eyes of the countries who had to be informed that the trip to such great allies as Sweden, Norway and Denmark (plus its province of Greenland) was called off&quot;.

From that time on, Clarkson and her office faced intense scrutiny. By November 2004, it was announced that Clarkson&#x27;s budget would be cut by ten percent, despite the fact that parliament itself had approved her budget each year. Then, in March 2005, she again faced questions about spending after it was reported that she had been advised by Martin to make official visits to Spain, the Netherlands, and Russia in order to attend the state funeral of the victims of the Madrid terrorist bombings, the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands, and participate in Victory in Europe Day celebrations in Moscow, respectively. Clarkson waited until less than two weeks after the end of her time serving as governor general before she publicly criticised Jean Chrétien and the Cabinet under his chairmanship for not defending the viceregal office, and reaffirmed that she had been asked by the Department of Foreign Affairs to take each of her state trips in the first place.

At the same time, Clarkson&#x27;s unorthodox mode of exercising the Office of the Governor General led to negative critiques of how she carried out a number of ceremonial duties. In June 2004, the Governor General and her office were targeted by Canadian monarchists, who noted that, prior to the ceremony to recognize Canada&#x27;s involvement at Juno Beach in the D-Day landings of 1944, Government House claimed that Clarkson would be attending as Canada&#x27;s head of state and, at the event, the Queen, who also attended the ceremony, was relegated to third place in precedence behind Clarkson and Saul. Jack Granatstein alleged that this arrangement had displeased the Queen and &quot;there was fury.&quot; Government House later retracted its head of state statement, saying that it was the error of a junior official, but why the protocol was altered was never explained. At Remembrance Day ceremonies, the Governor General also caused a stir when she eschewed the tradition of placing the first wreath at the cenotaph in favour of doing so simultaneously with her husband; a practice that was discontinued by Clarkson&#x27;s viceregal successor. Then, during a visit to Vancouver in September of the same year, Clarkson was booed and hissed at by a small but vocal group of protesters. She was on a goodwill tour of a poor area of the city; however, the protesters argued that her visit was nothing more than a publicity stunt to try to gain some of her lost popular support to get her time in office extended.

In January 2005, disappointment was further expressed over Clarkson&#x27;s failure to attend a memorial service for Alberta&#x27;s late lieutenant governor, Lois Hole. Rideau Hall issued a statement saying the Governor General was, at the time, abroad representing Canada at the inauguration of the President of Ukraine, Victor Yushchenko. However, the inauguration was postponed, and it was felt that Clarkson could have returned to Canada for the service. When it was later reported by the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that Clarkson would wait in Paris, France, for the rescheduled presidential investiture, more outrage was expressed in the press, which was only compounded when Rideau Hall informed the public that the Governor General would also attend a &quot;long-standing engagement&quot; with the Queen at Sandringham House, contradicting reports that Buckingham Palace had said the dinner was actually booked at the last minute. In response, some monarchists began lobbying Clarkson to resign, had she willingly used the Queen for publicity and damage control purposes.

====Extended tenure====
Regardless of the controversies, Clarkson was asked, and agreed, to remain in the Queen&#x27;s service for an additional year beyond the traditional, but not official, five-year period. Though the decision was met with mixed feelings from across the country, Prime Minister Martin had advised the Queen to retain Clarkson as her vicereine in order to provide stability while the country faced potential constitutional difficulties arising from a minority government; there had been speculation at the end of 2004 over whether or not Clarkson would have to become directly involved in politics should the Cabinet led by Paul Martin lose the confidence of the House of Commons, leaving the Governor General to decide whether or not to ask the leader of Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition, then Stephen Harper, to form a government, or to call a general election. Ultimately, circumstances played out so that Clarkson&#x27;s personal involvement was rendered unnecessary.

Soon after, however, on July 8, 2005, Clarkson was admitted to hospital in Toronto in order to have a pacemaker implanted. She recovered quickly, and returned to her viceregal duties in the same month. To coincide with that year&#x27;s 50th anniversary of the appointment of the first Canadian-born governor general, Clarkson moved Order of Canada investitures from their typical location in Rideau Hall to various places around the country. Also, on July 23, 2005, Clarkson was inducted as an honorary member of the Kainai Chieftainship, during a traditional ceremony held at Red Crow Park, near Standoff, Alberta, after which she was adopted into the Blood Tribe with the name &quot;Grandmother of Many Nations&quot;; this made Clarkson the first governor general since Edward Schreyer in 1984 to be made an honorary chief, and only the third woman to be inducted since the creation of the chieftainship. Then, on September 15, 2005, Clarkson announced the creation of the Governor General&#x27;s Northern Medal, to be awarded annually to a citizen whose actions and achievements had contributed to the evolution and constant reaffirmation of the Canadian North as part of the national identity.

During her last days in office, Clarkson&#x27;s popularity with the Armed Forces was expressed in a large farewell ceremony mounted by the military; the first ever such send-off for a governor general. Similarly, on the morning of September 26, 2005, Clarkson attended a celebration on Parliament Hill in which Member of Parliament thanked her for her work and presented her with the viceregal flag that flew atop the Peace Tower when Clarkson was present in parliament. Then, following tradition, Clarkson and Saul planted on Rideau Hall&#x27;s grounds, two ceremonial trees (swamp white oaks) to mark the end of the former&#x27;s time in office, and the next day, Clarkson&#x27;s time as vicereine ended when her successor, Michaëlle Jean, was sworn in as Governor General of Canada. However, Clarkson caused yet another controversy when she decided, with Jean&#x27;s consent, to attend Jean&#x27;s investiture, marking the first time in more than a century that a governor general had attended the swearing-in of his or her successor.

===Legacy===
Clarkson was seen as having brought new life to the post of governor general, receiving praise through her first years in office for being a more modern governor general who brought increased public attention to the position; Michaëlle Jean recognised Clarkson as having &quot;infused the office with a new energy&quot;, for &quot;promot[ing] artists and their achievements from across Canada&quot;, and for her &quot;close work with aboriginal communities&quot;. Clarkson was further praised for her devotion to the armed forces and remembrance, and was credited for breathing new life into the Canadian monarchy as a whole; Mailo&#x27; Ken Wiwa stated in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;: &quot;that Adrienne Clarkson, once a refugee, represents the Queen here in Canada is, for me, the singular most important reason for believing that the monarchy is relevant to Canada&#x27;s emerging identity. Her role may only be ceremonial and symbolic, but as the enduring quality of the Royal Family attests, you can never underestimate the power of myth. Even or rather, especially in this iconoclastic age.&quot; Clarkson and her husband also travelled across Canada and met more Canadians than any other governor general in Canadian history and, unlike many other state figures, Clarkson also wrote most of her own speeches, which were noted for being simultaneously intellectual and approachable. Clarkson&#x27;s tenure was also notable for her patronage of all the arts making such efforts as ensuring the governor general&#x27;s study at Rideau Hall had copies of every book that had won the Governor General&#x27;s Awards for literature and for sports, as demonstrated in her creation on September 14, 2005, of the Clarkson Cup for women&#x27;s hockey in Canada. John Fraser in 2012 stated of Clarkson: &quot;[N]o one, in the whole history of Rideau Hall, ever evoked the country quite as effectively&quot;.

Other summaries of Clarkson&#x27;s time as governor general, however, found that the increased travel abroad attracted negative attention to the viceregal post over costs and caused conflict between domestic duties and foreign obligations. Also, it was observed that Clarkson had succumbed too easily to the desires of her advisors both in the prime minister&#x27;s and Privy Council offices, as well as amongst the staff of Government House to turn the viceregal post into something it was not: Canada&#x27;s head of state. Clarkson had expressed admiration for the Queen, was said to understand &quot;the lustre the Crown affords,&quot; and to have &quot;shudder[ed] a little in sympathy with members of the Royal Family at the degree of intrusion into their lives they must bear.&quot; But the systematic downplaying of the monarch led to confusion over who was head of state and there was a sense that, by taking this view, Clarkson and her office were overturning the long-standing theory that all the viceroys and their respective jurisdictions are equal under a sovereign who reigns consistently over the whole country. When Clarkson attended a provincial occasion, her protocol officers insisted that she take precedence over the pertinent lieutenant governor and denied knowledge of the established order in which the lieutenant governor, as a direct representative of the Queen in a province, takes precedence at a provincial function over all other attendees, save for the monarch. These situations would result in &quot;precedence battles&quot;, in which the provincial authorities would frequently acquiesce to pressure and ultimatums from Rideau Hall. Clarkson also took the place of the monarch in presenting to the next vicereine the Chancellor&#x27;s insignia of the Order of Canada, thereby breaking the order&#x27;s &quot;first and oldest tradition&quot;; a move Canada&#x27;s expert on honours, Christopher McCreery, called &quot;a rather bizarre turn of events&quot;. The Monarchist League of Canada even reported that a member of parliament had telephoned to ask if they had ever before heard of the eruption of booing at the mention of the governor general&#x27;s name, as had apparently happened in the MP&#x27;s riding when Clarkson was spoken about.

==Post-viceregal life==
After leaving Rideau Hall, Clarkson and Saul purchased a new home in Toronto&#x27;s the Annex district, taking possession at the end of September 2005. She also signed a deal with Penguin Canada to publish her memoirs in two books. The first, &quot;Heart Matters&quot;, was published in September 2006, making Clarkson the third former governor general to release an autobiography. In the first half of the book, Clarkson outlined her childhood in Ottawa and her career in the CBC, while the second half covered her time as governor general, and contained her own positive views of Jean Chrétien and negative views of Paul Martin. The book was met with mixed reviews, however, and her expressed opinion that future nominees for appointment as governor general should be voted on in the House of Commons was condemned by monarchists, though supported by &quot;Macleans&quot;.

During an October 2006 interview on CBC Newsworld with Don Newman, Clarkson spoke her views on the nature of the position of Governor General of Canada, stating that while the Queen remained popular with Canadians, the governor general was now the direct representative of &quot;the Crown&quot;, and not of the monarch, therefore making the viceroy Canada&#x27;s actual head of state. This was a theory contrary to those of Eugene Forsey, the government of Canada itself, and numerous others, but was in line with Edward McWhinney. Into 2009, Clarkson continued to promote this notion, stating at a constitutional law conference that the governor general embodied the nation and the prime minister&#x27;s nominee for the viceregal role should thus be vetted by a parliamentary committee, in a similar format to Congressional Confirmation Hearings in the United States. She then went further to say that the candidate should also submit to a televised quiz on Canadiana. Though a University of Toronto political scientist stated this would &quot;strengthen the legitimacy of the governor-general as a non-partisan umpire,&quot; the editorial board of the Montreal &quot;Gazette&quot; said that the position being &quot;not elected is an asset, not a handicap&quot; and Clarkson&#x27;s process would undermine the impartiality of the viceroy.

Clarkson was on February 7, 2007, appointed by the Queen as Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, replacing the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, and commented that she was &quot;deeply honoured&quot; and proud to accept the role. The ceremony to mark her appointment took place on March 17 at the regimental headquarters in Edmonton. Clarkson is also vice-chair of the board of directors of the dance company La La La Human Steps and, in 2014, was announced as the presenter of that year&#x27;s Massey Lectures. Her lectures, which were also published in book form, were on the theme of &quot;Belonging: The Paradox of Citizenship&quot;.

==Personal life==
Since the 1980s, Clarkson has been in a relationship with Canadian writer and philosopher John Ralston Saul. In 1963, Clarkson married Stephen Clarkson, a University of Toronto political science professor. Together, the couple had three daughters: Kyra, born in 1969, and twins Blaise and Chloe, born in 1971; at the age of nine months, however, Chloe died of sudden infant death syndrome. Adrienne and Stephen divorced four years later. Her daughters have been estranged from her and were adopted by Christine McCall, Stephen Clarkson&#x27;s second wife. Blaise is a family doctor in Toronto and Kyra an architect in New York and since relocated back to Toronto.

A member of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Clarkson is a devout Anglican, as is her entire family going back five generations, with her uncle being a priest in the Anglican Church in Hong Kong. Clarkson chose to attend Trinity College at the University of Toronto because of its Anglican associations, and, while there, she casually dated divinity student Michael Peers, who would later become an archbishop and primate of the Anglican Church of Canada. This friendship was maintained over the years, and Peers presided over Clarkson&#x27;s marriage to Saul, officiated at her installation as governor general, and presided over the funerals of both her parents. Clarkson is also credited for returning prayer to the viceregal installation ceremony, which had been removed when Roméo LeBlanc was installed in 1995.

Clarkson was admired by the faithful for being open about her religious beliefs during her time in Rideau Hall. In a December 2005 interview with the &quot;Anglican Journal&quot;, she was quoted as saying about the Anglican elements of her heraldic arms that &quot;I am an Anglican and that is part of my life; that I really feel at home in the Anglican Communion.&quot; In this same interview, she criticized conservatives for creating what she called the &quot;deep divide&quot; in the Anglican church regarding homosexuality. Clarkson was also noted for visiting Anglican churches around Canada on her many tours, saying that she enjoyed seeing how the church fit in communities in all parts of Canada. Her public faith, however, was also the cause of controversy: She received particular criticism when she was seen taking communion in a Catholic church since that denomination does not permit open communion.

<text>Gordon Graydon (December 7, 1896 – September 19, 1953) was a Canadian politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Peel from 1935 to 1953.

==Background==

Graydon received his early education at S.S. No. 6 Chinguacousy in the County of Peel, Ontario. He attended Brampton High School and was a student at University of Toronto in political science. He graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1924. He then became a partner of the late Justice William Raney, one-time Attorney General of Ontario.

In 1933, at the age of 36, Graydon became the President of the Peel County Conservative Association. He was the youngest man ever to hold that position. In 1934, he helped rejuvenate the Conservative Party of Ontario by forming Young Conservative Clubs at a time when the party&#x27;s existence was threatened.

He was a member of Grace United Church, Brampton, of several local lodges, including Campbell&#x27;s Cross Loyal Orange Lodge of the Board of Regents of Victoria College and of the Peel War Records Board.

A high school in Mississauga has been named in his honour. A senior public (junior high) school in Brampton, Ontario also bears his name.

==Politics==

He was one of thirty-five Conservative candidates who survived the Liberal Party landslide of the 1935 federal election, winning Peel riding for his party.

Graydon was Opposition Leader in the House of Commons of Canada from 1943 to 1945 because John Bracken, the new leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, did not have a seat in the House and chose not to seek one until the 1945 federal election.

In 1945, he was Canadian delegate to the San Francisco World Conference, and delegate in London, representing Canada on the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations. He was Alternate Delegate for Canada at the UN&#x27;s 1st General Assembly 1946, Parliamentary advisor to the Canadian Delegate to the UN General Assembly in 1950 and in New York, 1952.

He remained a Member of Parliament for Peel until his death in 1953.

<doc id="161207" wikidata="Q242562" url="?curid=161207" title="Big Bird">
<text>Big Bird is a Muppet character designed by Jim Henson and built by Kermit Love for the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. An bright yellow anthropomorphic bird, he can roller skate, ice skate, dance, swim, sing, write poetry, draw, and ride a unicycle. Despite this wide array of talents, he is prone to frequent misunderstandings, on one occasion even singing the alphabet as a single word (pronouncing it as in the song &quot;ABC-DEF-GHI&quot;). He would refer to grocer Mr. Hooper as &quot;Mr. Looper&quot;, among other mispronunciations. He lives in a large nest behind the 123 Sesame Street brownstone and right next to Oscar the Grouch&#x27;s trash can. In Season 46, the nest sits within a small, furnished maple tree, and is no longer hidden by used construction doors. He has a teddy bear named Radar.

Caroll Spinney performed Big Bird from 1969 to 2018. Matt Vogel began as an understudy in 1996 before becoming the character&#x27;s full-time performer in 2018.

In 2000, Big Bird was named a Living Legend by the United States Library of Congress.

==Performing Big Bird==
Big Bird was performed by Caroll Spinney starting in 1969. In the later years of Spinney&#x27;s career, the show gradually started training new performers to play Big Bird. The apprentices included both Rick Lyon in the opening theme song of the show&#x27;s 33rd season, and later Matt Vogel in the show&#x27;s &quot;Journey to Ernie&quot; segment. Vogel became Big Bird&#x27;s primary performer after Spinney&#x27;s retirement.

Spinney was sick during the taping of a few first-season episodes, so Daniel Seagren performed Big Bird in those episodes. He also performed Big Bird when he appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1969 and on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in the 1970s. According to &quot;The Story of Jim Henson&quot; by Stephanie St. Pierre, the costume was built for Jim Henson to perform, but when Henson tried it on, Kermit Love, who had built the costume, did not think that Henson was walking like a bird is supposed to walk, and so Henson decided not to perform Big Bird. Frank Oz was offered the part, but since he disliked performing full-body characters, he turned down the job.

Director Jon Stone, in the 1994 documentary &quot;The World of Jim Henson&quot;, revealed that the Big Bird costume actually did not have any openings that would allow the actor to see; a small television was strapped to the actor&#x27;s chest to allow him to navigate. The camera was set up for Spinney by technician Walt Rauffer, on the suggestion of director Bob Myhrum. Rauffer rigged the camera to a harness strapped to Spinney&#x27;s chest; Spinney reported that they called the camera &quot;the electronic bra&quot;. When Big Bird&#x27;s performer is performing on location and cannot get a video feed, a small hole is made in the costume to allow him to see. In such cases, Big Bird wears a necktie to cover the hole. This can also be seen in the &quot;Sesame Street Live&quot; shows.

In scenes where Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch (both characters performed by Spinney) interact in a scene together, the situation has varied depending on the number of lines one or the other is given. When Spinney performed Big Bird, a second puppeteer operated Oscar to Spinney&#x27;s vocals. Beginning in 1997, Vogel would operate Big Bird and Oscar was performed by Spinney as usual until 2015.

In 2015, due to being diagnosed with dystonia, Spinney no longer puppeteered the Big Bird suit full-time. Matt Vogel took over puppetry duties, manipulating the puppet to Spinney&#x27;s vocals (either pre-recorded, dubbed in post-production, or provided live on set). Spinney continued to provide Big Bird&#x27;s voice on the series for seasons 46 and 47, as well as select commercials, online videos, and the special &quot;Once Upon a Sesame Street Christmas&quot;. Afterwards, Spinney entered semi-retirement, and Matt Vogel fully assumed the role. Despite this, Spinney continued to receive onscreen credit for playing the characters through Season 50.

On October 17, 2018, Spinney announced his official retirement from both his characters. The following day, he recorded his final performances as Big Bird and Oscar as part of Episode 5022 for the series&#x27; landmark 50th anniversary, though, when the episode aired, none of his vocals were kept in. Spinney&#x27;s final vocal performance as Big Bird to air was in the cold open for Episode 4920.

==Costume and portrayal==

Big Bird was designed by a drawing from Jim Henson and built by Kermit Love in 1969. The design was based on a previous Henson creation, a dragon that the puppeteer created for a La Choy advertising campaign. The Big Bird performer is completely enclosed within the costume, and extends his right hand over his head to operate the head and neck of the puppet. The Muppeteer&#x27;s left hand serves as the Bird&#x27;s left wing, while the right wing is stuffed and hangs loosely from a fishing line that runs through a loop under the neck and attaches to the wrist of the left hand. The right hand thus does the opposite of the left hand: as the left hand goes down, the right hand is pulled up by the fishing line. A secondary muppeteer would be used in scenes where Big Bird uses both his wings or holds something in the right wing.

Big Bird&#x27;s body suit weighs ten pounds, and his head weighs four pounds. According to writer Louise Gikow, the heat inside the suit is &quot;unbearable, and it&#x27;s extraordinarily difficult to hold Big Bird&#x27;s head.&quot;

Different versions of Big Bird are portrayed in some international versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. For example, the Dutch version has a blue bird named Pino. In the Latin American version (Plaza Sésamo), Big Bird&#x27;s parrot cousin, Abelardo Montoya, is featured. He appears similar to Big Bird, but he is green.

Big Bird&#x27;s appearance has changed over the years, as has his personality. He originally had very few feathers on top of his head; his body feathers were also more shaggy and unkempt, and his body was not as rounded and full as it is now. His personality was more dopey and &quot;bird-brained&quot; than it later became. He gradually got more feathers on top, giving his head a more rounded appearance, and developed a blaze-like crest of lighter yellow feathers above his eyes. His body got fluffier, rounder and more well groomed as well. His personality developed over time from being a dim, slow-witted character into the childlike innocence he is known for today. Although all the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppet characters are technically ageless, Big Bird is psychologically written to represent a six-year-old.

The costume is partially assembled by company American Plume &amp; Fancy Feather, using the tail feathers from turkeys; as the feathers are rarely clean, company owner Anthony Trento calls the Big Bird costume his &quot;toughest customer&quot;. Sesame Workshop is said to reject roughly 90 percent of all the feathers selected for use on the costume.

==Species==
The book &quot;“G” is for Growing: Thirty Years of Research on Children and Sesame Street&quot; cites a producer of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; who refers to Big Bird as a canary. In the series 11 episode, &quot;Mister Rogers Talks about Competition&quot; of the show, &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, Big Bird was asked by King Friday XIII if he was related to the cassowary; he replied, &quot;I&#x27;m actually a Golden Condor.&quot; On the January 23, 1976 episode of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, Big Bird was asked what kind of bird he is and said he was a lark, causing host Peter Marshall to crack up. In the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat the Pictures&quot;, Osiris calls Big Bird an ibis. Zoologist Mike Dickison suggested in his popular Pechakucha talk that Big Bird represents a unique species that evolved from the whooping crane. For decades, Oscar the Grouch has been calling Big Bird a turkey, more as an insult rather than a reference to his species. Big Bird is always described as being flightless.

==Use of Big Bird in the 2012 US presidential election==
During the first presidential debate on October 3, 2012, Mitt Romney used Big Bird as an example of spending cuts he would make to reduce the federal budget deficit. Romney told the moderator, Jim Lehrer, &quot;I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I&#x27;m not going to – I&#x27;m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That&#x27;s number one.&quot;

Barack Obama’s campaign later released a satirical advertisement in which Romney described Big Bird as an &quot;evil genius&quot; and &quot;a menace to our economy&quot;, and depicted Romney as more concerned with cracking down on Big Bird than on white collar criminals such as Bernie Madoff and Ken Lay.

Sesame Workshop subsequently asked that both campaigns remove &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters from campaign materials, stating on their website: &quot;Sesame Workshop is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization and we do not endorse candidates or participate in political campaigns.&quot;

In response to the mention in the debates, Big Bird made an appearance in a 2012 Weekend Update segment on Saturday Night Live with then host Seth Meyers. During the interview, Big Bird joked about how he suddenly &quot;felt famous&quot; after being mentioned in the debates, but refused to make any political statements as to not &quot;ruffle any feathers.&quot;

== COVID-19 vaccine and parody Twitter account ==
On November 6, 2021, the character&#x27;s official Twitter account posted that Big Bird had received a COVID-19 vaccine, in an effort to promote vaccination of children. After President Joe Biden responded in support, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz criticized Sesame Street for the statement. In response, a parody Twitter account, Big Bird for Senate, (not affiliated with or endorsed by Sesame Workshop) was created portraying Big Bird as a candidate for Cruz&#x27;s senate seat. The account gained over 100,000 followers in its first week, and numerous other accounts were made casting Sesame Street characters as campaign officials. The original account has since been deleted.

==Other appearances==

===&quot;Follow That Bird&quot; (1985)===
In 1985, Big Bird was the star of his own film, &quot;Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird&quot;, alongside the cast of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. The plot focused on him being moved away to live with a family of dodos by a meddling social-worker named Miss Finch (voiced by Sally Kellerman). He is not happy with his new home and he runs away and embarks on a cross-country adventure. Along the way, he finds help from a friendly truck driver (Waylon Jennings) and two farmer kids (Alyson Court and Benjamin Barrett). But on the bad side, there are two unscrupulous carnival-owning brothers (Dave Thomas and Joe Flaherty) who want to kidnap and make him perform in their carnival for their own profit. In the meantime, his friends Bert, Ernie, Cookie Monster, Grover, Count von Count, Telly and Oscar the Grouch are in pursuit of him to find him and bring him back home safely. Also joining them are their human friends, Gordon, Maria, Olivia and Linda with Bob aiding them from Sesame Street.

===1970s and 1980s===
In the mid-late 1970s, Big Bird made several appearances on &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;. As with Mr. Hooper, Big Bird frequently mispronounced host Peter Marshall&#x27;s name, calling him &quot;Mr. Marshmallow&quot; or &quot;Mr. Masher&quot;. In another episode, when asked by Marshall what kind of bird he was, Big Bird replied &quot;I&#x27;m a lark&quot;, which broke Marshall up.

He appeared in a series 11 episode of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe segment, in which he enters the &quot;Draw the Neighborhood&quot; contest.

He made an appearance as a guest star on the third season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. A portrait of Big Bird also appeared in the pilot &quot;The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence&quot;.

Big Bird also made brief appearances in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; and &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;.

He appeared in &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot; holiday special, in which he dissuades the Swedish Chef from cooking him for Christmas dinner by offering him a gift of homemade chocolate covered birdseed. They then sing a duet of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;.

===Henson memorial service (1990)===
On May 21, 1990, Big Bird appeared at Jim Henson&#x27;s memorial service at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, singing Kermit the Frog&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Bein&#x27; Green&quot;. Performer Caroll Spinney nearly broke down several times during the deeply touching performance, which was later described by &quot;Life&quot; as &quot;an epic and almost unbearably moving event&quot;.

===21st century===
Big Bird made a non-speaking appearance in &quot;The West Wing&quot; Season 5 episode &quot;Eppur Si Muove&quot;. During a visit by The Muppets to the White House, Big Bird sat down on a bench next to C. J. Cregg, who had complained during the episode of past comparisons to Big Bird due to her height.

He appeared briefly at Qualcomm&#x27;s CES Keynote on January 7, 2013, to show off Sesame Workshop&#x27;s newest app, &#x27;Big Bird&#x27;s Words&#x27;, due in Summer 2013.

He appeared in the final episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in 2014 along with Cookie Monster and dozens of other celebrities singing &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot;.

On February 16, 2015, Big Bird appeared alongside Michelle Obama on &quot;Billy on the Street&quot;, a comedy game show hosted by Billy Eichner. Before the quiz, Michelle Obama talked about &quot;eat brighter&quot;, a campaign to promote healthy food in kids which she and a number of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters, including Big Bird, participated in. The short was nominated for an Emmy Award later that year.

Big Bird appeared with Caroll Spinney in a spoof of the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Birdman.&quot; Published on YouTube on February 19, 2015, the video shows Spinney sitting in a dressing room with a poster of Big Bird behind him. Spinney hears the voice of his alter ego, just as Michael Keaton&#x27;s character Riggan hears his alter ego Birdman in the movie. He uses telekinesis to throw a box of tissues at the Big Bird poster. The spoof uses similar music to the &quot;Birdman&quot; film. The Big Birdman spoof appears as if it were shot in one long take, mimicking the long scenes of the movie. It follows Spinney out of the dressing room, down hallways, through doors, and out onto the sidewalk, where he is joined by Big Bird.

In an advertisement for AT&amp;T/DirecTV, Big Bird and other film/television personalities such as David Hasselhoff (as his &quot;Knight Rider&quot; persona Michael Knight) and the Oklahoma Sooners football team appear interspersed with the daily workings of a major city as someone walks around using the service&#x27;s TV Everywhere initiative.

At the 2019 Kennedy Center Honors, which was filmed on the day Spinney died, Vogel made an appearance as Big Bird for the event to celebrate &quot;Sesame Street&quot; being honored by the Kennedy Center.

<doc id="161208" wikidata="Q561765" url="?curid=161208" title="Caroll Spinney">
<text>Caroll Edwin Spinney (December 26, 1933 – December 8, 2019) was an American puppeteer, cartoonist, author, artist and speaker, most famous for playing Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from its inception in 1969 until 2018.

==Early life==
Spinney was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, on December 26, 1933, to Chester and Margaret Spinney. He had two older brothers, Donald and David. His mother, a native of Bolton, England, named him Caroll despite him being male because he was born the day after Christmas. He drew and painted from childhood, and developed a love of puppeteering when he saw a performance of &quot;Three Little Kittens&quot; at the age of five. This motivated him to purchase a monkey puppet from a rummage sale three years later and put on a puppet show utilizing the monkey and a plush snake. The following Christmas, his mother gave him a Punch and Judy puppet theater. He continued puppeteering throughout his childhood and adolescence and used his performances to raise money for college tuition.

After he graduated from Acton High School (subsequently Acton-Boxborough Regional High School) in Acton, Massachusetts, Spinney served in the U.S. Air Force.

==Career==
===Comics and cartoons===
While in the Air Force, Spinney wrote and illustrated &quot;Harvey&quot;, a comic strip about military life. He also animated a series of black-and-white cartoons called &quot;Crazy Crayon&quot;.

===Early puppeteering===
In 1955, Spinney relocated to Las Vegas, where he performed in the show &quot;Rascal Rabbit&quot;. He returned to Boston, joining &quot;The Judy and Goggle Show&quot; in 1958 as a puppeteer &quot;Goggle&quot; to Judy Valentine&#x27;s Judy. Throughout the 1960s, he performed on the Boston broadcast of &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Big Top&quot;, where he played various costumed characters which included Flip Flop the Rag Doll, Mr. Rabbit, Kookie the Boxing Kangaroo as well as Mr. Lion, who created cartoon drawings from the names of children participating in the show. Through that decade, he was also a commercial artist and animator.

Spinney created a puppet duo consisting of two cats named Picklepuss and Pop, which he utilized throughout the 1960s. Many years later, Spinney&#x27;s Picklepuss and Pop puppets were characters in &quot;Wow, You&#x27;re a Cartoonist!&quot;

===As a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; puppeteer===

Spinney first met Jim Henson in 1962 at a puppeteering festival, where Henson asked if he would like to &quot;talk about the Muppets&quot;. As Spinney failed to realize the question was an employment offer, the conversation never came to pass.

In 1969, Spinney performed at a Puppeteers of America festival in Utah. His show was a mixture of live actors and puppets but was ruined by an errant spotlight that washed out the animated backgrounds. Henson was once again in attendance and noticed Spinney&#x27;s performance. &quot;I liked what you were trying to do,&quot; Henson said, and he asked once more if they could &quot;talk about the Muppets&quot;. This time, they did have the conversation, and Spinney joined the Muppeteers full-time by late 1969.

Spinney joined &quot;Sesame Street&quot; for the inaugural season in 1969. However, he nearly left after the first season because he was not getting acceptable pay, but Kermit Love persuaded him to stay. He performed Big Bird and Oscar in Australia, China, Japan, and across Europe. As Big Bird and Oscar, Spinney conducted orchestras across the US and Canada, including the Boston Pops, and visited the White House multiple times. He provided the characters&#x27; voices on dozens of albums.

As Oscar, Spinney wrote &quot;How to Be a Grouch&quot;, a Whitman Tell-A-Tale picture book. With J. Milligan, he wrote the 2003 book &quot;The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch): Lessons from a Life in Feathers&quot;. Spinney narrated the audiobook &quot;Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street&quot; by Michael Davis. His work has been studied by other international puppeteers who structure their performance styles after his, most evidently with full-body puppet costumes. For example, in the Chinese performance of Da Niao on &quot;Zhima Jie&quot;, the costume is an exact physical replica of Big Bird.

Though Big Bird and Oscar were his main characters, Spinney also performed as other characters. At one point, he created and performed Bruno the Trashman, a full-bodied puppet representing a garbage man, who also carried Oscar&#x27;s trash can. Bruno was used until the foam plastic of the character broke down. Spinney also performed as Granny Bird, Big Bird&#x27;s grandmother. The puppet used for Granny Bird was actually a spare Big Bird puppet, and Spinney provided her voice. As Granny Bird&#x27;s appearances were often alongside Big Bird (who is, as she stated, her &quot;favorite grandson&quot;), her voice was usually pre-recorded so that Spinney could perform Big Bird. Spinney reprised his role as Oscar the Grouch in &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; in a cameo appearance next to Darth Vader.

On October 17, 2018, Spinney officially announced his retirement from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; after 49 years. His last performances as Big Bird and Oscar were recorded as part of the series&#x27; landmark 50th season, which aired in 2020, albeit Spinney&#x27;s final recording session as his characters were ultimately not used in the broadcast version of the episode. The roles of Big Bird and Oscar were handed over to Matt Vogel and Eric Jacobson, respectively. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Spinney was earning over $300,000 per year at the time of his retirement.

===Artwork===
Some of Spinney&#x27;s artwork includes the 1996 painting called &quot;Luna Bird&quot;, showing Big Bird walking on the Moon, and the 1997 painting &quot;Autumn&quot;, showing him playing in autumn leaves. Spinney also drew the drawing of Mr. Hooper that sits near Big Bird&#x27;s nest.

==Personal life and death==
Spinney had three children from his first marriage to Janice Spinney, whom he married in 1960. Spinney and Janice divorced in 1971. Spinney was married to his second wife, Debra Jean Gilroy, from 1979 until his death. In 2015, Spinney was diagnosed with dystonia, a neurological movement disorder that causes muscle contractions.

Spinney died at his home in Woodstock, Connecticut, on December 8, 2019, at the age of 85.

<doc id="161209" wikidata="Q5977253" url="?curid=161209" title="Prostitution in Nevada">
<text>Nevada is the only U.S. state where prostitution is legally permitted in some form. Prostitution is legal in 10 of Nevada&#x27;s 17 counties, although only six allow it in every municipality. Six counties have at least one active brothel, which mainly operate in isolated, rural areas. The state&#x27;s most populated counties, Clark (which contains Las Vegas) and Washoe (which contains Reno), are among those that do not permit prostitution. It is also illegal in Nevada&#x27;s capital, Carson City, an independent city.

The vast majority of prostitution in Nevada takes place illegally in the metropolitan areas of Las Vegas and Reno. About 66 times more money is spent by customers on illegal prostitution in Nevada than in the regulated brothels.

== History ==

Prostitution has been present in Nevada since the early days of statehood. Historically, Nevada&#x27;s legislature considered prostitution a local issue, leaving it up to counties and cities to regulate, with only minimal regulation at state level, namely prohibiting brothels near schools or churches. In 1937, a law was enacted to require weekly health checks of all prostitutes. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an order to suppress prostitution near military bases—affecting the red-light districts of Reno and Las Vegas. When this order was lifted in 1948, Reno officials tried to shut down a brothel as a public nuisance; this action was upheld by the Nevada Supreme Court in 1949. In 1951, both Reno and Las Vegas had closed their red-light districts as public nuisances, but brothels continued to exist throughout the state.

In 1971, Joe Conforte, owner of a brothel called Mustang Ranch, near Reno, in Storey County, convinced county officials to enact an ordinance which would provide for the licensing of brothels and prostitutes, thus avoiding the threat of being closed down as a public nuisance.

Officials in Las Vegas, afraid that Conforte would use the same technique to open a brothel nearby, convinced the legislature, in 1971, to enact legislation prohibiting the legalization of prostitution in counties with a population above a certain threshold, tailored to apply only to Clark County.

In 1977, county officials in Nye County tried to shut down Walter Plankinton&#x27;s Chicken Ranch as a public nuisance; brothels did not have to be licensed in that county at the time, and several others were operating. Plankinton filed suit, claiming that the 1971 state law had implicitly removed the assumption that brothels are public nuisances &quot;per se&quot;. The Nevada Supreme Court agreed with this interpretation in 1978, and so the Chicken Ranch was allowed to operate. In another case, brothel owners in Lincoln County protested when the county outlawed prostitution in 1978, having issued licenses for seven years. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled, however, that the county had the right to do so.

A state law prohibiting the advertising of brothels in counties which have outlawed prostitution was enacted in 1979. It was promptly challenged on First Amendment grounds, but in 1981, the Nevada Supreme Court declared it to be constitutional. (Princess Sea Industries, one of the parties involved in the case, was Plankinton&#x27;s company that owned the Chicken Ranch.) In July 2007, the law was overturned by a U.S. District judge as &quot;overly broad&quot;, and advertising in Las Vegas started soon after. In March 2010, the district judge&#x27;s decision was reversed back by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The ACLU appealed to the full Ninth Circuit Court in March 2010. It further appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States in 2011, but the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. The ban on brothels advertising therefore remains in force.

While brothels and prostitutes are subject to federal income tax and also pay local fees, Nevada has no state income tax, and brothels are exempt from the state entertainment tax and do not pay any other state taxes. In 2005, brothel owners lobbied to be taxed in order to increase the legitimacy of the business, but the legislature declined. Brothels pay taxes to their respective counties. Lyon County receives approximately $400,000 to $500,000 per year from these taxes.

In November 2005, former prostitute and madam Heidi Fleiss said that she would partner with brothel owner Joe Richards to turn Richards&#x27; existing Cherry Patch Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nye County, Nevada into an establishment that would employ male prostitutes and cater exclusively to female customers, a first in Nevada. In 2009, however, she said that she had abandoned her plans to open such a brothel due to wishing to avoid having to &quot;deal with all the nonsense in the sex business&quot; and preferring to focus on renewable energy which would be &quot;perfect for Nevada. That&#x27;s where the money is. That&#x27;s the wave of the future.&quot;

On December 11, 2009, the Nevada State Board of Health unanimously agreed to add urethral examinations to the guidelines, thus allowing male sex workers to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases.

== Legal situation ==
Under Nevada state law, any county with a population of up to 700,000, as of the last decennial census is allowed to license brothels if it so chooses. Incorporated towns and cities in counties that allow prostitution may regulate the trade further or prohibit it altogether.

Currently 6 out of Nevada&#x27;s 17 counties have active brothels (these are all rural counties). As of September 2023, there are 19 active legal brothels in the state.

State law prohibits prostitution in Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), and under county or municipal law in Carson City (an independent city), and these other counties: Douglas, Eureka, Lincoln, Pershing, and Washoe (which contains Reno). The other 10 Nevada counties permit licensed brothels in certain specified areas or cities. All 10 of these rural counties have had at least one legal brothel in operation subsequent to 1971, but many of these brothels were financially unsuccessful or ran afoul of State health regulations. As of 2016, only seven of these counties have active brothels, while the other three (Churchill County, Esmeralda County and Humboldt County) no longer do.

The precise licensing requirements vary by county. License fees for brothels range from an annual $100,000 in Storey County to an annual $200,000 in Lander County. Licensed prostitutes must be at least 21 years old, except in Storey County and Lyon County (where the minimum age is 18).

The brothels and their employees must register with the county sheriff and receive regular medical checkups. Brothels have existed in Nevada since the old mining days of the 1800s and were first licensed in 1971. The legendary Mustang Ranch operated from 1971 through 1999, when it was forfeited to the federal government following a series of convictions for tax fraud, racketeering, and other crimes.

Nevada law requires that registered brothel prostitutes be tested weekly (by a cervical specimen) for gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis, and monthly for HIV and syphilis; furthermore, condoms are mandatory for all oral sex and sexual intercourse. Brothel owners may be held liable if customers become infected with HIV after a prostitute has tested positive for the virus. Women work a legally mandated minimum of nine days for each work period.

Nevada has laws against engaging in prostitution outside of licensed brothels, against encouraging others to become prostitutes, and against living off the proceeds of a prostitute.

In June 2009, then-Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons signed the most stringent punishments nationwide for child prostitution and pandering. Assembly Bill 380, which allows for fines of $500,000 for those convicted of trafficking prostitutes younger than 14 and $100,000 for trafficking prostitutes ages 14 to 17. Both the House and the Senate unanimously approved the bill, which went into effect October 1, 2009.

===Overview===
====State legislation====
* Prostitution is only legal in licensed brothels.
* Brothels are prohibited in counties with more than 700,000 inhabitants.
* The use of condoms by prostitutes is mandatory.
* Prostitutes must be tested for STIs weekly/monthly.

====County legislation====
== Legal brothels ==
As of February 2018, 21 legal brothels exist in the state employing about 200 women at any given time. In some locales, there exist multi-unit complexes of several separate brothels run by the same owner. These include &quot;The Line&quot; in Winnemucca, and Mustang Ranch in Storey County.

As of September 2023, only 19 legal brothels remain open in the state, located in just 6 rural counties.

Mandatory HIV testing began in 1986 and a mandatory condom law was passed in 1988. A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent. The study also found that few of the prostitutes used condoms in their private lives.

== Illegal prostitution ==
Illegal prostitution is the most common form of prostitution in Nevada; the offense is a misdemeanor. The cities of Las Vegas and Reno have worked to expand their tourism base by attracting families to the hotels and casinos. Accordingly, the state legislature has made prostitution illegal in Clark County, and law enforcement agencies have tried to eliminate the once-rampant street prostitution, enacting legislation against it in 1971. Nevertheless, prostitutes continue to work in casinos, where they wait in bars and attempt to make contact with potential clients. Of all the prostitution business in Nevada, only about 10% is legal, and 90% of illegal prostitution occurs in Las Vegas. The vast majority of prostitution in Nevada takes place illegally in the metropolitan areas of Las Vegas and Reno. Legal prostitution in Nevada grosses about $75 million per year while illegal prostitution in the Las Vegas area grosses about $5 billion per year. Some 300–400 prostitutes are arrested each month by the Las Vegas police.

Escort services offering sexual services euphemistically as &#x27;entertainment&#x27; or &#x27;companionship&#x27; are ubiquitous, with a reported 104 pages of a Las Vegas yellow pages directory devoted to &quot;entertainers&quot;. Flyers are dispensed to tourists and others along the Las Vegas Strip by freelance workers. These flyers also graphically depict female &#x27;personal&#x27; entertainers or escort services. Despite the attempt to make the Las Vegas Strip more family-friendly, such advertising for these services continues.

In 2009 Las Vegas was identified by the FBI as one of 14 cities in the U.S. with high rates of child prostitution. Las Vegas police claimed that &quot;roughly 400 children are picked off the streets from prostitution each year.&quot;

The U.S. Justice Department has also named Las Vegas among the 17 most likely destinations for human trafficking.

== Criticism ==

The brothels in Nevada&#x27;s rural counties have been criticized by law enforcement professionals, journalists, sex worker activists, feminists, social and religious conservatives and politicians.
Columnist Bob Herbert wrote: 

During the 1970s and early 1980s, several towns had enacted rules prohibiting local brothel prostitutes from frequenting local bars or casinos or associating with local men outside of work. After a lawsuit was filed in 1984, these regulations had to be abandoned, but as a result of collaboration between sheriffs and brothel owners, they remain in effect unofficially. Most brothels do not allow the prostitutes to leave the premises during their work shifts of several days to several weeks.

In 2009, prostitution researcher Melissa Ditmore wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that brothels &quot;impose some extraordinary restrictions on commercial sex workers&quot; in order to &quot;separate sex workers from the local community&quot;: some places forbid prostitutes to leave the brothels for extended periods of time, while other jurisdictions require the prostitutes to leave the county when they are not working; some places do not allow the children of the women who work in the brothels to live in the same area; some brothel workers who have cars must register the vehicle with the local police, and workers are not permitted to leave the brothel after 5pm; in some counties registered sex workers are not allowed to have cars at all.

The Nevada brothel system has also been criticized by activists in the sex worker rights movement, who are otherwise supporters of full decriminalization of prostitution. Organizations and individuals supporting the rights of prostitutes typically favor deregulation and oppose Nevada-style regulation, mainly for three reasons:
* the licensing requirements create a permanent record which can lead to discrimination later on;
* the large power difference between brothel owner and prostitute gives prostitutes very little influence over their working conditions;
* while prostitutes undergo legal and health background checks, their customers do not; the regulations are thus designed to protect customers, not prostitutes.

Teri, a prostitute who has worked in a Nevada brothel (and who would like prostitution to be decriminalized), stated that &quot;The brothel owners are worse than any pimp. They abuse and imprison women and are fully protected by the state&quot;.

Another former prostitute who worked in four Nevada brothels attacked the system, saying, &quot;Under this system, prostitutes give up too much autonomy, control and choice over their work and lives&quot; and &quot;While the brothel owners love this profitable solution, it can be exploitative and is unnecessary&quot;. She described how the women were subject to various exaggerated restrictions, including making it very difficult for them to refuse clients, not being allowed to read books while waiting for customers, and having to deal with doctors who had a &quot;patronizing or sexist attitude&quot; (the brothels discouraged and in many cases forbade prostitutes to see doctors of their own choosing).

In an article published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2007, anti-prostitution campaigner, Julie Bindel wrote: &quot;If you believe their PR, Nevada&#x27;s legal brothels are safe, healthy – even fun – places in which to work. So why do so many prostitutes tell such horrific tales of abuse?&quot;

In her 2007 report, &quot;Prostitution and trafficking in Nevada: making the connections&quot;, anti-prostitution activist Melissa Farley presents the results of numerous interviews with brothel owners and prostitutes, she says that most brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps and that they suffer widespread abuse by brothel owners and customers. Farley said that &quot;What happens in legal brothels is sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and sometimes rape&quot;; she also said more than 80% of the women she had interviewed told her they wanted to leave prostitution.

Alexa Albert, a Harvard medical student who has conducted a public-health study inside one of Nevada&#x27;s brothels, and authored &quot;Brothel: Mustang Ranch and Its Women&quot;, wrote in her book that the brothel owners used to require the prostitutes to have outside pimps, because the pimps were thought to make the women work harder: &quot;The involvement of pimps enabled brothel owners to leave discipline to men who wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to keep their women in line.&quot;

Bob Herbert also stated that many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps: &quot;Despite the fiction that they are &quot;independent contractors,&quot; most so-called legal prostitutes have pimps — the state-sanctioned pimps who run the brothels and, in many cases, a second pimp who controls all other aspects of their lives (and takes the bulk of their legal earnings).&quot;

In 1998, pimps from Oregon managed to place at least four underage girls in Nevada&#x27;s legal brothels; they were arrested and convicted.

On underage girls being trafficked to Nevada&#x27;s brothels, Oregon Detective Greg Harvey said, &quot;It&#x27;s happening right now, it&#x27;s amazing how many girls are shipped from here to different brothels in northern and southern Nevada. Many are underage.&quot; Another detective, Sgt. Pete Kerns, supported Harvey&#x27;s claims. &quot;Never buy the line that nobody under 18 works in (Nevada brothels),&quot; Kerns said. &quot;It&#x27;s happening.&quot;

Former Nye County Commissioner Candice Trummell, director of the Nevada Coalition Against Sex Trafficking, said, &quot;It is way past time for Nevada to be the last state in the United States of America to finally stand against all forms of slavery.&quot;

Assemblyman Bob L. Beers said, &quot;A brothel owner is somebody who, when it gets down to the very essence, is nothing more than a slave-owner.&quot;

Some brothel owners have been involved in criminal activities: in March 2009, a Nye County brothel owner pleaded guilty to fraud charges for paying bribes to a former Nye County Commissioner; in 2008, a former brothel owner was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison on two child pornography charges; and in 1991, Joe Conforte fled to Brazil in order to avoid a conviction on tax fraud charges.

== Politics ==

Occasionally, lawmakers attempt to introduce legislation outlawing all prostitution in Nevada. These efforts are typically supported by owners of casinos and other large businesses, claiming that legalized prostitution harms the state&#x27;s image. The Nevada Brothel Owners&#x27; Association, led by George Flint of Reno, lobbies against these laws. Rural lawmakers normally oppose these laws as well, despite the fact that legal brothel prostitution does not provide a significant amount of income for counties.

A noted opponent of legalized prostitution in Nevada was John Reese. Initially arguing on moral and religious grounds, he switched to health hazard tactics, but had to back down in the face of a threatened libel suit. In 1994, he tried to get a license for a gay brothel in a thinly veiled attempt to galvanize opposition against all brothels. Five years later, he staged his own kidnapping near the Mustang Ranch. His efforts to collect enough signatures to repeal the prostitution laws have so far failed.
Nevada politicians can (and generally do) play both sides of the prostitution dispute by declaring that they are personally opposed to prostitution but feel it should be up to the counties to decide. As almost three-quarters of the population of Nevada lives in a single county (Clark County, where prostitution is illegal), county control over local matters is a hot-button issue. Legislators from the northern counties will often reflexively oppose what is seen as &quot;meddling&quot; from the majority in the south, and the legislators from the south have been too divided on the issue to push through a state-wide ban.

Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a &quot;little Amsterdam&quot;. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said.

The brothel owners&#x27; organization, supported by Democratic State Senator Bob Coffin, has been pushing for taxation of the brothels, to increase the industry&#x27;s legitimacy. The proposal, which would have instituted a $5 tax per act of prostitution, with the proceeds partly being used for a sex worker counseling agency, was voted down in the Taxation Committee in April 2009.

In February 2011, U.S. Senator Harry Reid suggested that brothels be made illegal in Nevada.

== Public opinion ==
The opinions of Nevada residents vary, but the majority appears to support the status quo of prostitution: they support laws allowing licensed brothels in the rural areas, but oppose the legalization of prostitution in Las Vegas. A poll conducted in Nevada in 2002 found that 52% of the 600 respondents favored the existing legal and regulated brothels, while 31% were against laws that allow prostitution and the remainder were undecided, preferred fewer legal constraints on prostitution, or did not offer an opinion. In 2003, nearly 60% of Nevada residents opposed the legalization of brothels and prostitution in Las Vegas (59% opposed this idea, 35% supported it and 6% did not know or did not answer). Again, support was stronger in the rural areas (where most people were born in Nevada) and weaker in Clark County and Washoe County; women were more opposed to the idea than men.

In 2004, after the closure of the last brothel in Churchill County, a county ballot initiative to permanently ban prostitution in that county was defeated by a 2–1 margin.

A July 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that 56% of Nevada voters thought that prostitution should be legal, while only 32% thought it should be illegal and 12% were not sure.

A June 2012 Public Policy Polling survey found that 64% of Nevada voters thought that brothels should be legal in the state, while only 23% thought they should be illegal, and 13% were not sure.

In 2018, Lyon County voted by a 3-to-1 margin to reject Question 1, which would have repealed the county&#x27;s brothel ordinance and closed four brothels in Mound House.

== Museum ==
Crystal, Nye County, Nevada, had a brothel art museum associated with two local brothels. Visitors have reported it was primarily newspaper clippings. As of 2020 both Crystal brothels were closed.

<text>The codice_1 (make directory) command in the Unix, DOS, DR FlexOS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows, and ReactOS operating systems is used to make a new directory. It is also available in the EFI shell and in the PHP scripting language. In DOS, OS/2, Windows and ReactOS, the command is often abbreviated to codice_2.

The command is analogous to the Stratus OpenVOS codice_3 command. MetaComCo TRIPOS and AmigaDOS provide a similar codice_4 command to create new directories. The numerical computing environments MATLAB and GNU Octave include an codice_1 
function with similar functionality.

==History==
In early versions of Unix (4.1BSD and early versions of System V), this command had to be setuid root as the kernel did not have an codice_1 syscall. Instead, it made the directory with codice_7 and linked in the codice_8 and codice_9 directory entries manually. The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later. Digital Research DR DOS 6.0 and Datalight ROM-DOS also include an implementation of the and commands.

The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by David MacKenzie.
It is also available in the open source MS-DOS emulator DOSBox and in KolibriOS.

==Usage==

Normal usage is as straightforward as follows:
mkdir name_of_directory
where codice_11 is the name of the directory one wants to create. When typed as above (i.e. normal usage), the new directory would be created within the current directory. On Unix and Windows (with Command extensions enabled, the default), multiple directories can be specified, and codice_1 will try to create all of them.

===Options===
On Unix-like operating systems, codice_1 takes options. The options are:
* codice_14: &quot;parents&quot; or &quot;path&quot;, will also create all directories leading up to the given directory that do not exist already. For example, codice_15 will create directory codice_16 if it doesn&#x27;t exist, then will create directory codice_17 inside directory codice_16. If the given directory already exists, ignore the error.
* codice_19: &quot;mode&quot;, specify the octal permissions of directories created by codice_1 .
codice_21 is most often used when using codice_1 to build up complex directory hierarchies, in case a necessary directory is missing or already there. codice_23 is commonly used to lock down temporary directories used by shell scripts.

===Examples===
An example of codice_21 in action is:
mkdir -p /tmp/a/b/c
If codice_25 exists but codice_26 does not, codice_1 will create codice_26 before creating codice_29.

And an even more powerful command, creating a full tree at once (this however is a Shell extension, nothing mkdir does itself):
mkdir -p tmpdir/{trunk/sources/{includes,docs},branches,tags}
If one is using variables with mkdir in a bash script, POSIX `special&#x27; built-in command &#x27;eval&#x27; would serve its purpose.
DOMAIN_NAME=includes,docs
eval &quot;mkdir -p tmpdir/{trunk/sources/{${DOMAIN_NAME}},branches,tags}&quot;
This will create:

 tmpdir
 ________|______
branches tags trunk
 sources
 ____|_____
 includes docs

<doc id="161213" wikidata="Q7972870" url="?curid=161213" title="Television and the Public Interest">
<text>&quot;Television and the Public Interest&quot; was a speech given by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Newton N. Minow to the convention of the National Association of Broadcasters on May 9, 1961. Popularly known as the &quot;Vast Wasteland speech&quot;, it was Minow&#x27;s first major speech after he was appointed chairman of the FCC by then President John F. Kennedy.

==Summary==
In the speech, Minow referred to American commercial television programming as a &quot;vast wasteland&quot; and advocated for programming in the public interest. In hindsight, the speech addressed the end of a Golden Age of Television that had run through the 1950s, contrasting the highbrow programs of that decade (Minow specifically cited &quot;Westinghouse Studio One&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, both of which had ended in the previous few years, as examples of &quot;the much bemoaned good old days,&quot; and later cited &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Victory at Sea&quot;, &quot;See It Now&quot;, and &quot;Peter Pan&quot; as examples of quality bygone programs) with what had appeared on American television in 1960 and 1961.

Minow mentioned a handful of praiseworthy shows that were still in production (among them &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, variety specials by Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, live news and sports coverage, and some documentaries), then warned that such programs were the exception rather than the rule:

Minow went on to dismiss the idea that public taste was driving the change in programming, stating his firm belief that if television choices were expanded, viewers would gravitate toward higher culture programming; he conceded that in most cases, viewers would choose a Western over a symphony, but responded that it was the television licensees&#x27; responsibility to give the options, regardless of ratings. He noted that a large majority of prime time television—59 out of 73 hours—consisted of undesirable television genera: quiz shows, movies, variety shows, sitcoms, and action-adventure series, the last of which included espionage thrillers and the then-ubiquitous Westerns. He stated that &quot;most young children today spend as much time watching television as they do in the schoolroom&quot; and that cartoons and violence typical of children&#x27;s television of the era was wholly unacceptable, comparable to feeding a child nothing but &quot;ice cream, school holidays and no Sunday school.&quot; He also used newspapers as a comparison, noting that although comic strips and advice columns were newspapers&#x27; most popular items, they were not featured on the front pages because (according to Minow) the newspapers were still voluntarily bound to the public interest despite being outside the purview of the FCC, something Minow believed television had abandoned as it had become too beholden to Nielsen Ratings. As he foresaw the eventual advent of satellite television, he believed that, if foreign audiences were to witness American television as it existed in 1960, they would be embarrassed.

Minow conceded that there were numerous barriers to improvement, many of them financial, and expressed his reluctance to use the FCC as a censor, except to enforce rules imposed following recent scandals in the quiz show genre and payola in music radio. A partial solution Minow proposed was the expansion of non-commercial educational television, which was not yet as widespread as the major broadcast networks. He was also a staunch believer in the promise of UHF television and hoped that its implementation would allow network options to double; he also promised not to stifle pay television in its infancy, conceding that he could not predict the outcome of such experiments, only that he hoped it would provide opportunities to serve niche markets in addition to those offering mass appeal. He also indicated he would crack down on what had been &quot;pro forma&quot; license renewals and hold public hearings in stations&#x27; cities of license, where he anticipated viewers could answer whether their stations served public interest.

In his speech Minow also shared advice to his audience:

Television and all who participate in it are jointly accountable to the American public for respect for the special needs of children, for community responsibility, for the advancement of education and culture, for the acceptability of the program materials chosen, for decency and decorum in production, and for propriety in advertising. This responsibility cannot be discharged by any given group of programs, but can be discharged only through the highest standards of respect for the American home, applied to every moment of every program presented by television. Program materials should enlarge the horizons of the viewer, provide him with wholesome entertainment, afford helpful stimulation, and remind him of the responsibilities which the citizen has toward his society.

He closed by paraphrasing Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.&quot;

==Reception==
The phrase &quot;vast wasteland&quot; was suggested to Minow by his friend, reporter and freelance writer John Bartlow Martin. Martin had recently watched twenty consecutive hours of television as research for a magazine piece, and concluded it was &quot;a vast wasteland of junk&quot;. During the editing process, Minow cut the words &quot;of junk&quot;.

Minow often remarked that the two words best remembered from the speech are &quot;vast wasteland&quot;, but the two words he wished would be remembered are &quot;public interest&quot;.

According to television historians Castleman and Podrazik (1982), the networks had already purchased their fall 1961 programs and had locked in their 1961–62 schedules at the time Minow had made his speech, leaving them unable to make the adjustments Minow had hoped. &quot;The best the networks could do was slot a few more public affairs shows, paint rosy pictures for 1962–63, and prepare to endure the barrage of criticism they felt certain would greet the new season.&quot; Castleman and Podrazik noted that there was an attempt to increase documentary programming in the 1962–63 season, but that &quot;their sheer number diluted the audience and stretched resources far too thin to allow quality productions each week,&quot; resulting in a schedule that much resembled &quot;business as usual.&quot; 1962 saw an even greater increase in some of the formats Minow detested, with premises becoming more and more surreal: two prime time cartoons (&quot;Beany and Cecil&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons&quot;) and sitcoms with outlandish premises (such as hillbillies becoming rich and moving to Beverly Hills in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, or a veterinarian getting mistakenly drafted and sent to Paris in &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Charlie!&quot;) were among the new offerings.

The speech was not without detractors, as that lambasting of the state of United States television programming prompted Sherwood Schwartz to name the boat on his television show &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; the S. S. &quot;Minnow&quot; after Newton Minow. Game show host Dennis James remarked in 1972 that Minow&#x27;s assertion that viewers naturally gravitated toward highbrow programming was proven false, noting that although &quot;the critics will always look down their noses,&quot; lowbrow forms of entertainment such as game shows &quot;have a tremendous appeal&quot; to the average American. He indirectly referenced Minow in the interview, quipping &quot;they can talk about the great wasteland and everything else—if you want to read books, read books.&quot;

In a 2011 interview marking the 50th anniversary of the speech, Minow stated that consumer choice, fueled by the 1980s multi-channel transition, was the most important improvement in television in the decades since his speech; he lamented that this increased choice had eliminated the shared experience of the medium. Writing for &quot;Wired Magazine&quot;, Matthew Lasar pointed out:
Like so many media reformers, Minow strikes me as reluctant to acknowledge an obvious difference between 1961 and 2011. TV is not a vast wasteland anymore. It&#x27;s a crazy, weed-filled, wonderful, out-of-control garden.

<doc id="161226" wikidata="Q326416" url="?curid=161226" title="Mickey Cochrane">
<text>Gordon Stanley &quot;Mickey&quot; Cochrane (April 6, 1903 – June 28, 1962), nicknamed &quot;Black Mike&quot;, was an American professional baseball player, manager and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Philadelphia Athletics and Detroit Tigers. Cochrane was considered one of the best catchers in baseball history and is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. In his first season as manager, he led the Tigers to 101 wins, which was the most for a rookie manager for 27 years (since Cochrane, six other managers have won 100 games as a rookie).

Cochrane was born in Massachusetts and was a multi-sport athlete at Boston University. After college, he chose baseball over basketball and football. He made his major league debut in 1925, having spent only one season in the minor leagues. He was chosen as the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player in 1928 and he appeared in the World Series from 1929 to 1931. Philadelphia won the first two of those World Series, but Cochrane was criticized for giving up stolen bases when his team lost the series in 1931. Cochrane&#x27;s career batting average (.320) is still an MLB record for a catcher.

Cochrane&#x27;s career ended abruptly after a near-fatal head injury from a beanball in 1937. After his professional baseball career, he served in the United States Navy in World War II and ran an automobile business. Cochrane died of cancer in 1962. In 1999, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked him 65th on its list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.

==Early life==
Cochrane was born in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. His father, John Cochrane, had immigrated from Omagh, County Tyrone in what is now Northern Ireland and his mother, Sadie Campbell, had come from Prince Edward Island, Canada, whence her family had immigrated from Scotland. He was also known as &quot;Black Mike&quot; because of his fiery, competitive nature. Cochrane was educated at Boston University, where he played five sports, excelling at football and basketball. Although Cochrane considered himself a better football player than baseball player, professional football was not as established as Major League Baseball at the time, so he signed with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in .

==Playing career==
===Philadelphia Athletics===
After just one season in the minor leagues, Cochrane was promoted to the major leagues, making his debut with the Philadelphia Athletics on April 14, 1925 at the age of 22. He made an immediate impact by becoming Connie Mack&#x27;s starting catcher in place of Cy Perkins, who was considered one of the best catchers in the major leagues at the time. A left-handed batter, he ran well enough that Mack would occasionally have him bat leadoff. He hit third more often, but whatever his place in the order his primary role was to get on base so that hard-hitting Al Simmons and Jimmie Foxx could drive him in. In May, he tied a twentieth-century major league record by hitting three home runs in a game. He ended his rookie season with a .331 batting average and a .397 on-base percentage, helping the Athletics to a second-place finish.

By the start of the 1926 season, Cochrane was already considered the best catcher in the major leagues. He won the American League Most Valuable Player Award, mostly for his leadership and defensive skills, when he led the American League in putouts and hit .293 along with 10 home runs and 58 runs batted in. Cochrane was a catalyst in the Athletics&#x27; pennant-winning years of 1929, 1930 and 1931, during which he hit .331, .357 and .349 respectively. He played in those three World Series, winning the first two, but was sometimes blamed for the loss of the 1931 World Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals, led by Pepper Martin, stole eight bases and the Series. However, in his book &quot;The Life of a Baseball Hall of Fame Catcher&quot;, author Charlie Bevis cites the Philadelphia pitching staff&#x27;s carelessness in holding runners as a contributing factor. Notwithstanding this, the blame for the 1931 World Series loss dogged Cochrane for the rest of his life.

===Detroit Tigers===

In 1934, Mack started to disassemble his dynasty for financial reasons and put Cochrane on the trade block. He found a willing recipient in the Detroit Tigers. Their owner, Frank Navin, was also suffering from financial troubles. They had not finished higher than third since 1923, and had developed a reputation for being content with mediocrity. Attendance at Navin Field had sagged for some time. Navin had originally hoped to acquire Babe Ruth and name him player-manager, but after those talks fizzled, he turned to the A&#x27;s. A deal to send Cochrane to Detroit was quickly arranged, and Navin immediately named him player-manager.

It was with Detroit where Cochrane cemented his reputation as a team leader and his competitive nature drove the Tigers, who had been picked to finish in fourth or fifth place, to the American League championship, their first pennant in 25 years. They won 101 games, which was the most by the team for 34 years, and Cochrane was the first ever rookie manager to achieve 100 wins. Cochrane routinely platooned Gee Walker, a right-handed batter, to spell left fielder Goose Goslin and center fielder Jo-Jo White, who were both left-handed batters. Cochrane&#x27;s leadership and strategic skills won him the 1934 Most Valuable Player Award, shocking considering that Lou Gehrig had won the Triple Crown, compiled a 10.0 WAR (Wins Above Replacement) rating which was more than double that of Cochrane&#x27;s and utterly dominated the league in every major offensive category. He followed this by leading the Tigers to another American League pennant in and earning a victory over the Chicago Cubs in the 1935 World Series; it was Detroit&#x27;s first undisputed world championship. In late 1935, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; speculated Cochrane might eventually succeed Navin as team president. Due in part to his high-strung nature, as well as considerable pressure to join the Black Legion, then-prominent in the Detroit area, he suffered a nervous breakdown during the 1936 season.

On May 25, 1937, Cochrane was hit in the head by a pitch from Yankees pitcher Bump Hadley. Cochrane had homered in his previous at-bat that day. Hospitalized for seven days, Cochrane nearly died from the injury. This accident generated a call for protective helmets for batters, although tradition won out at that time. Cochrane was forced to retire at the age of 34 after doctors ordered him not to attempt to play baseball again.
Cochrane compiled a .320 batting average while hitting 119 home runs and 830 runs batted in over a 13-year playing career. He also had 1,652 hits, 1,041 runs scored, 333 doubles, 64 triples, 64 stolen bases and a .478 slugging percentage. His .320 batting average is the highest career mark for catchers. His .419 on-base percentage is among the best in baseball history, and is the highest all-time among catchers. In , he became the first major league catcher to score 100 runs and produce 100 runs batted in during the same season.

He hit for the cycle twice in his career, on July 22, 1932 and August 2, 1933.

In his first 11 years, he never caught fewer than 110 games. He led American League catchers six times in putouts and twice each in double plays assists and fielding percentage.

Cochrane returned to the dugout to continue managing the Tigers but had lost his competitive fire. He managed for the remainder of the 1937 season but was replaced midway through the 1938 season by coach and former catcher Del Baker. His all-time managerial record was 348–250, for a .582 winning percentage.

==Managerial record==
==Later life and legacy==
Despite his head injury, Cochrane served in the United States Navy during World War II. Commissioned as a lieutenant and assigned to Naval Station Great Lakes, he oversaw physical training of new recruits and coached the baseball team. On July 7, 1942, Cochrane managed an All-Service team that played against an American League all-star squad at Cleveland’s Municipal Stadium; the American League team beat the servicemen, 5–0. Later in the war Cochrane, by now a lieutenant commander, was assigned to a similar role in the Pacific Theater.

In 1947, Cochrane became the third catcher enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame, after Roger Bresnahan and Buck Ewing. Long after the Athletics left Philadelphia for Kansas City in 1954 without retiring his uniform number 2, the Philadelphia Phillies honored him by electing him to the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame at Veterans Stadium. The Athletics&#x27; plaques from that display have since been moved to the Philadelphia Athletics Museum in Hatboro, Pennsylvania. The Tigers honored him by renaming National Avenue (behind the third-base stands of the old Tiger Stadium) Cochrane Avenue. Despite making the Hall of Fame, The Tigers did not retire his uniform number No. 3. 71 years later, it was retired for Alan Trammell—22 years after his retirement.

Cochrane briefly worked in baseball after World War II, notably serving as a coach, and then as general manager, of the Athletics during the season, Mack&#x27;s last year as manager. He also owned an automobile business after his baseball days; he sold it in the mid-1950s. A heavy smoker, Cochrane was only 59 when he died in 1962 in Lake Forest, Illinois of lymphatic cancer.

In his book, &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, baseball historian Bill James ranked Cochrane fourth all-time among major league catchers. In 1999, he was ranked 65th on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Yankee Hall of Fame slugger Mickey Mantle was named after him.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Cochrane as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

<doc id="161227" wikidata="Q6430706" url="?curid=161227" title="Critic">
<text>A critic is a person who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator&#x27;s intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.

Characteristics of a good critic are articulateness, preferably having the ability to use language with a high level of appeal and skill. Sympathy, sensitivity and insight are also important. Form, style and medium are all considered by the critic. In architecture and food criticism, the item&#x27;s function, value and cost may be added components.

Critics are publicly accepted and, to a significant degree, followed because of the quality of their assessments or their reputation. Influential critics of art, music, theater and architecture often present their arguments in complete books. One very famous example is John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot; and &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;. Critics may base their assessment on a range of theoretical positions. For instance, they may take a feminist or Freudian perspective.

Unlike other individuals who may editorialize on subjects via websites or letters written to publications, professional critics are paid to produce their assessment and opinions for print, radio, magazine, television, or Internet companies. When their personal opinion outweighs considered judgment, people who give opinions, whether on current events, public affairs, sports, media or art are often referred to as &quot;pundits&quot; instead of critics.

Critics are themselves subject to competing critics, since the final critical judgment always entails subjectivity. An established critic can play a powerful role as a public arbiter of taste or opinion. Also, critics or a coordinated group of critics, may award symbols of recognition.

== Derivation ==

The word &quot;critic&quot; comes , which is a Greek derivation of the word &quot;(krités)&quot;, meaning a person who offers reasoned judgment or analysis, value judgment, interpretation or observation. Early English meaning of criticism was based mainly on the criticism of literature and it was in the 17th century that more general forms of criticism began.

== Critics&#x27; views of criticism ==

Cultural critic Clement Greenberg wrote that a good critic excels through &quot;insights into the evidence ... and by ... loyalty to the relevant&quot;; poet and critic T.S. Eliot wrote &quot;a critic must have a very highly developed sense of fact&quot;.

In 1971, Harold C. Schonberg, chief music critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 1960 to 1980, said that he wrote for himself, &quot;not necessarily for readers, not for musicians. ... It&#x27;s not a critic&#x27;s job to be right or wrong; it&#x27;s his job to express an opinion in readable English.&quot; Schonberg was the first music critic to receive the Pulitzer Prize for criticism.

Daniel Mendelsohn described the equation of criticism for critics as knowledge + taste = meaningful judgement.

Restaurant critic Terry Durack explained that from a critic &quot;you hope for a thorough, objective and legitimate discussion&quot; that puts &quot;opera, art or book into context, so that it adds to your own body of knowledge&quot;; in the context of a restaurant criticism, this means it is &quot;not about me liking it or not; it&#x27;s about me helping you decide whether you are going to like it or not.&quot;


== Social and political critics ==

Social and political critics have used various forms of art to express their criticism, including literature and music. Pierre Beaumarchais, for example, prior to the French Revolution, used his play &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; to denounce aristocratic privilege, and a critic&#x27;s influence is enhanced by subsequent reworkings such as the operatic versions of Beaumarchais&#x27;s play (&quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;) by Rossini and (&quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;) by Mozart. August Ahlqvist, a Finnish professor and poet, who highly admired J. L. Runeberg, the national poet of Finland, gave very negative feedback to the entire literary production of the author Aleksis Kivi, when Kivi presented content of the peoples social life in the form of rude realism instead of romanticism. Among the most famous social/political criticism in literary form are Jonathan Swift&#x27;s satire &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and George Orwell&#x27;s satire &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. Some political critics, such as Ai Weiwei use visual art as their medium. Throughout history, political critics have faced higher risks, including the risk of imprisonment or death.

== Online critics ==

Several websites have developed for the purpose of compiling or publishing original critical reviews. Examples include Blogcritics, Rotten Tomatoes, and Yelp. According to A. O. Scott, chief film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, everyone on the Internet is a critic. Some critics like Roger Ebert achieve iconic status in pop culture and become well regarded.

== Cinematography and television ==
The American film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel collaborated and appeared on television sometimes agreeing on their review of cinematographic works; sometimes they would differ.

Film critics may use star classification to qualify the reviewed works.

Characters depicting critics have been part of some movies, and have been represented in comedies, such as a food critic in the animated fantasy-comedy &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, and as an art critic in one of the initial parts of the anthology comedy film &quot;The History of the World Part I&quot;.

== Responses to critics ==

People whose work is the subject of criticism have a full range of responses to it. For example, they may be appreciative, offended, distressed, encouraged, amused or nonplussed.

<text>A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of thought, often the manifestation of non-fictional, as well as fictional, content. The word originates from the Latin &#x27;, which denotes a &quot;teaching&quot; or &quot;lesson&quot;: the verb&#x27; denotes &quot;to teach&quot;. In the past, the word was usually used to denote written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. In the Computer Age, &quot;document&quot; usually denotes a primarily textual computer file, including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and images. Contemporarily, &quot;document&quot; is not defined by its transmission medium, e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents. &quot;Documentation&quot; is distinct because it has more denotations than &quot;document&quot;. Documents are also distinguished from &quot;realia&quot;, which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of &quot;document&quot; because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as two-dimensional representations. While documents can have large varieties of customization, all documents can be shared freely and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. History, events, examples, opinions, stories etc. all can be expressed in documents.

==Abstract definitions==
The concept of &quot;document&quot; has been defined by Suzanne Briet as &quot;any concrete or symbolic indication, preserved or recorded, for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental.&quot;

An often-cited article concludes that &quot;the evolving notion of &quot;document&quot;&quot; among Jonathan Priest, Paul Otlet, Briet, Walter Schürmeyer, and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. David M. Levy has said that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents.
A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital environment. As an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence by those who study it.

&quot;Document&quot; is defined in library and information science and documentation science as a fundamental, abstract idea: the word denotes everything that may be represented or memorialized to serve as evidence. The classic example provided by Briet is an antelope: &quot;An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document[;] she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document.&quot; This opinion has been interpreted as an early expression of actor–network theory.

==Kinds==
A document can be structured, like tabular documents, s, forms, or scientific charts, semi-structured like a book or a newspaper article, or unstructured like a handwritten note. Documents are sometimes classified as secret, private, or public. They may also be described as drafts or proofs. When a document is copied, the source is denominated the &quot;original&quot;.

Documents are used in numerous fields, e.g.:
* Academia:
** manuscript,
** thesis,
** paper,
** journal,
** chart,
** and technical drawing
* Media:
** mock-up,
** script,
** image,
** photography,
** and newspaper article
* Administration, law, and politics:
** application,
** brief,
** certificate,
** commission,
** constitutional document,
** form,
** gazette,
** identity document,
** license,
** manifesto,
** summons,
** census,
** and white paper
* Business:
** invoice,
** request for proposal,
** proposal,
** contract,
** packing slip,
** manifest,
** report (detailed and summary),
** spreadsheet,
** material safety data sheet,
** waybill,
** bill of lading,
** financial statement,
** nondisclosure agreement (NDA),
** mutual nondisclosure agreement,
** and user guide
* Geography and planning:
** topographic map,
** cadastre,
** legend,
** and architectural plan

Such standard documents can be drafted based on a template.

==Drafting==
The page layout of a document is how information is graphically arranged in the space of the document, e.g., on a page. If the appearance of the document is of concern, the page layout is generally the responsibility of a graphic designer. Typography concerns the design of letter and symbol forms and their physical arrangement in the document (see typesetting). Information design concerns the effective communication of information, especially in industrial documents and public signs. Simple textual documents may not require visual design and may be drafted only by an author, clerk, or transcriber. Forms may require a visual design for their initial fields, but not to complete the forms.

==Media==

Traditionally, the medium of a document was paper and the information was applied to it in ink, either by handwriting (to make a manuscript) or by a mechanical process (e.g., a printing press or laser printer). Today, some short documents also may consist of sheets of paper stapled together.

Historically, documents were inscribed with ink on papyrus (starting in ancient Egypt) or parchment; scratched as runes or carved on stone using a sharp tool, e.g., the Tablets of Stone described in the Bible; stamped or incised in clay and then baked to make clay tablets, e.g., in the Sumerian and other Mesopotamian civilizations. The papyrus or parchment was often rolled into a scroll or cut into sheets and bound into a codex (book).

Contemporary electronic means of memorializing and displaying documents include:
* Monitor of a desktop computer, laptop, tablet; optionally with a printer to produce a hard copy;
* Personal digital assistant;
* Dedicated e-book device;
* Electronic paper, typically, using the Portable Document Format (PDF);
* Information appliance;
* Digital audio player; and
* Radio and television service provider.

Digital documents usually require a specific file format to be presentable in a specific medium.

== In law ==
Documents in all forms frequently serve as material evidence in criminal and civil proceedings. The forensic analysis of such a document is within the scope of questioned document examination. To catalog and manage the large number of documents that may be produced during litigation, Bates numbering is often applied to all documents in the lawsuit so that each document has a unique, arbitrary, identification number.

<text>Frances Eliza Hodgson Burnett (24 November 1849 – 29 October 1924) was a British-American novelist and playwright. She is best known for the three children&#x27;s novels &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; (1886), &quot;A Little Princess&quot; (1905), and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1911).

Frances Eliza Hodgson was born in Cheetham, Manchester, England. After her father died in 1853, when Frances was 4 years old, the family fell on straitened circumstances and in 1865 emigrated to the United States, settling in New Market, Tennessee. Frances began her writing career there at age 19 to help earn money for the family, publishing stories in magazines. In 1870, her mother died. In Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1873 she married Swan Burnett, who became a medical doctor. Their first son Lionel was born a year later. The Burnetts lived for two years in Paris, where their second son Vivian was born, before returning to the United States to live in Washington, D.C. Burnett then began to write novels, the first of which (&quot;That Lass o&#x27; Lowrie&#x27;s&quot;), was published to good reviews. &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; was published in 1886 and made her a popular writer of children&#x27;s fiction, although her romantic adult novels written in the 1890s were also popular. She wrote and helped to produce stage versions of &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; and &quot;A Little Princess&quot;.

Beginning in the 1880s, Burnett began to travel to England frequently and in the 1890s bought a home there, where she wrote &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. Her elder son, Lionel, died of tuberculosis in 1890, which caused a relapse of the depression she had struggled with for much of her life. She divorced Swan Burnett in 1898, married Stephen Townsend in 1900, and divorced him in 1902. A few years later she settled in Nassau County, New York, where she died in 1924 and is buried in Roslyn Cemetery.

In 1936, a memorial sculpture by Bessie Potter Vonnoh was erected in her honor in Central Park&#x27;s Conservatory Garden. The statue depicts her two famous &quot;Secret Garden&quot; characters, Mary and Dickon.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood in Manchester, United Kingdom===

Frances Eliza Hodgson was born at 141 York Street in Cheetham, Manchester on 24 November 1849. She was the third of five children of Edwin Hodgson, an ironmonger from Doncaster in Yorkshire, and his wife Eliza Boond, from a well-to-do Manchester family. Her father owned a business in Deansgate, selling ironmongery and brass goods. The family lived comfortably, employing a maid and a nurse-maid. Frances had two older brothers and two younger sisters.

In 1852, the family moved about a mile away to a newly built terrace, opposite St Luke&#x27;s Church, with greater access to outdoor space. Barely a year later, on 1 September 1853 and with his wife pregnant for a fifth time, Hodgson died suddenly of a stroke, leaving the family without an income. Frances was cared for by her grandmother while her mother took over running the family business. From her grandmother, who bought her books, Frances learned to love reading, in particular her first book, &quot;The Flower Book&quot;, which had colored illustrations and poems. Because of their reduced income, Eliza had to give up their family home and moved with her children to live with relatives in Seedley Grove, Tanners Lane, Pendleton, Salford, where they lived in a house with a large enclosed garden in which Frances enjoyed playing.

For a year Frances went to a small dame school run by two women, where she first saw a book about fairies. When her mother moved the family to Islington Square, Salford, Frances mourned the lack of flowers and gardens. Their new home was located in a gated square of faded gentility adjacent to an area with severe overcrowding and poverty that &quot;defied description&quot;, according to Friedrich Engels, who lived in Manchester at the time.

Frances had a fertile imagination, writing stories of her own creation in old notebooks. One of her favorite books was Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, and she spent many hours acting out scenes from the story. Frances and her siblings were sent to be educated at The Select Seminary for Young Ladies and Gentlemen, where she was described as &quot;precocious&quot; and &quot;romantic&quot;. She had an active social life and enjoyed telling stories to her friends and cousins; in her mother, she found a good audience, although her brothers tended to tease her about her stories.

Manchester was almost entirely dependent on a cotton economy that was ruined by the Lancashire cotton famine brought about by the American Civil War. In 1863, Eliza Hodgson was forced to sell their business and move the family once again to an even smaller home; at that time, Frances&#x27; limited education came to an end. Eliza&#x27;s brother (Frances&#x27;s uncle), William Boond, asked the family to join him in Knoxville, Tennessee, where he now had a thriving dry goods store. Within the year, Eliza decided to accept his offer and move the family from Manchester. She sold their possessions and told Frances to burn her early writings in the fire. In 1865, the family emigrated to the United States and settled near Knoxville.

=== Move to Tennessee ===
After the end of the Civil War and the trade it had brought to the area, Frances&#x27;s uncle lost much of his business and was unable to provide for the newly arrived family. The family went to live in a log cabin during their first winter in New Market, outside Knoxville. They later moved to a home in Knoxville that Frances called &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark, Mt. Ararat&quot;, a name inspired by the house&#x27;s location atop an isolated hill. Living across from them was the Burnett family, and Frances became friendly with Swan Burnett, introducing him to books by authors such as Charles Dickens, Sir Walter Scott and William Makepeace Thackeray that she had read in England. She may have befriended him because of a childhood injury that left him lame and unable to participate in physical activities. Not long after they met, Swan left for college in Ohio.

Frances turned to writing to earn money. Her first story was published in &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot; in 1868. Soon after, she was being published regularly in &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, &quot;Peterson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Keen to escape from the family&#x27;s poverty, she tended to overwork herself, later writing that she had been &quot;a pen driving machine&quot; during the early years of her career. For five years, she wrote constantly, often not worrying about the quality of her work. Once her first story was published, before she was 18, she spent the rest of her life as a working writer. By 1869, she had earned enough to move the family into a better home in Knoxville.

Her mother died in 1870, and within two years, two of her sisters and a brother were married. Although she remained friends with Swan, neither was in a hurry to be married.

=== Marriage ===
With the income from her writing, she returned to England for an extended visit in 1872, and then went to Paris where, having agreed to marry Swan, she ordered an haute couture wedding dress to be made and shipped to Tennessee. Shortly afterward, she returned home and attempted to postpone the wedding until the dress arrived, but Swan insisted they marry as soon as possible, and they were married in September 1873. Writing about the dress disappointment to a Manchester friend, she said of her new husband: &quot;Men are so shallow ... he does not know the vital importance of the difference between white satin and tulle, and cream-colored brocade&quot;. Within the year, she gave birth to her first child, Lionel, in September 1874. Also during that year, she began work on her first full-length novel, &quot;That Lass o&#x27; Lowrie&#x27;s&quot;, set in Lancashire.

The couple wanted to leave Knoxville, and her writing income allowed them to travel to Paris, where Swan continued his medical training as an eye and ear specialist. The birth of their second son, Vivian, forced them to return to the United States. She had wanted her second child to be a girl, and having chosen the name Vivien, changed to the masculine spelling for her new son. The family continued to rely on her writing income, and to economize she made clothing for her boys, often including many frills. Later, Burnett continued to make clothing, designing velvet suits with lace collars for her boys and frilly dresses for herself. She allowed her sons&#x27; hair to grow long, which she then shaped into long curls.

=== Moved to Washington, D.C. ===

After two years in Paris, the family intended to move to Washington, D.C., where Swan, now qualified as a doctor, wanted to start his medical practice. However, as they were in debt, Frances was forced to live with Swan&#x27;s parents in New Market while he established himself in D.C. Early in 1877, she was offered a contract to have &quot;That Lass o&#x27; Lowrie&#x27;s&quot; published, which was doing well in its serialization, and at that point, she made her husband her business manager. &quot;That Lass o&#x27; Lowrie&#x27;s&quot; was published to good reviews, and the rights were sold for a British edition. Shortly after the publication of the book, she joined her husband in D.C., where she established a household and friends. She continued to write, becoming known as a rising young novelist. Despite the difficulties of raising a family and settling into a new city, Burnett began work on &quot;Haworth&#x27;s&quot;, which was published in 1879, as well as writing a dramatic interpretation of &quot;That Lass o&#x27; Lowrie&#x27;s&quot; in response to a pirated stage version presented in London. After a visit to Boston in 1879, where she met Louisa May Alcott, and Mary Mapes Dodge, editor of children&#x27;s magazine &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;, Burnett began to write children&#x27;s fiction. For the next five years, she had published several short works in &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;. Burnett continued to write adult fiction as well: &quot;Louisiana&quot; was published in 1880; &quot;A Fair Barbarian&quot; in 1881; and &quot;Through One Administration&quot; in 1883. She wrote the play &quot;Esmerelda&quot; in 1881 while staying at the &quot;Logan House&quot; inn near Lake Lure, North Carolina; it became the longest-running play on Broadway in the 19th century. However, as had happened earlier in Knoxville, she felt the pressure of maintaining a household, caring for children and a husband, and keeping to her writing schedule, which caused exhaustion and depression.

Within a few years, Burnett became well known in Washington society and hosted a literary salon on Tuesday evenings, often attended by politicians, as well as local literati. Swan&#x27;s practice grew and had a good reputation, but his income lagged behind hers, so she believed she had to continue writing. Unfortunately she was often ill and suffered from the heat of D.C., which she escaped whenever possible. In the early 1880s she became interested in Christian Science as well as Spiritualism and Theosophy. These beliefs would affect her later life as well as being incorporated into her later fiction. She was a devoted mother and took great joy in her two sons. She doted on their appearance, continuing the practice of curling their long hair each day, which became the inspiration for &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;.

In 1884, she began work on &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, with the serialization beginning in 1885 in &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;, and the publication in book form in 1886. &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; received good reviews, became a bestseller in the United States and England, was translated into 12 languages and secured Burnett&#x27;s reputation as a writer. The story features a boy who dresses in elaborate velvet suits and wears his long hair in curls. The central character, Cedric, was modeled on Burnett&#x27;s younger son Vivian, and the autobiographical aspects of &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; occasionally led to disparaging remarks from the press. After the publication of &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, Burnett&#x27;s reputation as a writer of children&#x27;s books was fully established. In 1888 she won a lawsuit in England over the dramatic rights to &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, establishing a precedent that was incorporated into British copyright law in 1911. In response to a second incident of pirating her material into a dramatic piece, she wrote &quot;The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, which was produced on stage in London and on Broadway. The play went on to make her as much money as the book.

=== Return to England ===
In 1887, Burnett traveled to England for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, which became the first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England. Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as Madame Tussaud&#x27;s Wax Museum in London. In her rented rooms, she continued the Tuesday evening salon and soon attracted visitors, meeting Stephen Townsend for the first time. Despite her busy schedule, she felt ill from the heat and the crowds of tourists, spending protracted periods in bed. With her sons, she moved on to spend the winter in Florence, where she wrote &quot;The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax&quot;, the only book to be published in England but not in the United States. That winter &quot;Sara Crewe or What Happened at Miss Minchin&#x27;s&quot; was published in the United States. She would go on to make &quot;Sara Crewe&quot; into a stage play, and later rewrite the story into &quot;A Little Princess&quot;. In 1888, Burnett returned to Manchester, where she leased a large home off Cromwell Road, had it decorated, and then turned it over to cousins to run as a boarding house, after which she moved to London, where she again took rooms, enjoyed the London season, and prepared &quot;Phyllis&quot; for production, a stage adaptation of &quot;The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax&quot;. When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews and turned to socialize. During this period she began to see more of Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.

In December 1890, Burnett&#x27;s elder son Lionel died from consumption in Paris, which greatly affected her life and her writing. Burnett had sought a cure for her son from physicians, also taking him to Germany to visit spas. Following his death, before she sank into a deep depression, she wrote in a letter to a friend that her writing was insignificant in comparison to having been the mother of two boys, one of whom died. At this time she turned away from her traditional faith in the Church of England and embraced a mix of Spiritualism, New Thought, Christian Science, and others without actually joining any particular church. She returned to London, where she sought the distraction of charity work and formed the Drury Lane Boys&#x27; Club, hosting an opening in February 1892. Also during this period, she wrote a play with a starring role for Stephen Townsend in an attempt to establish his acting career. After a two-year absence from her Washington, D.C. home, her husband, and her younger son, Burnett returned there in March 1892, where she continued charity work and began writing again. In 1893, Burnett published an autobiography, devoted to her elder son, titled &quot;The One I Knew Best of All&quot;. Also in that year, she had a set of her books displayed at the Chicago World Fair.

=== Divorce and move to Great Maytham Hall ===

Burnett returned to London in 1894; there she heard the news that her younger son Vivian was ill, so she quickly went back to the United States. Vivian recovered from his illness, but missed his first term at Harvard University. Burnett stayed with him until he was well, then returned to London. At this time, she began to worry about her finances: she was paying for Vivian&#x27;s education; keeping a house in Washington D.C. (Swan had moved out of the house to his own apartment); and keeping a home in London. As she had in the past, she turned to writing as a source of income and began to write &quot;A Lady of Quality&quot;. &quot;A Lady of Quality&quot;, published in 1896, was to become the first of a series of successful adult historical novels, which was followed in 1899 with &quot;In Connection with the De Willoughby Claim&quot;; and in 1901 she had published &quot;The Making of a Marchioness&quot; and &quot;The Methods of Lady Walderhurst.&quot;

In 1898, when Vivian graduated from Harvard, she divorced Swan Burnett. Officially, the cause for the divorce was given to be desertion, but in reality, Burnett and Swan had orchestrated the dissolution of their marriage some years earlier. Swan took his own apartment and ceased to live with Burnett so that after a period of two years she could plead desertion as a reason for the divorce. The press was critical, calling her a New Woman, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; writing that the divorce resulted from Burnett&#x27;s &quot;advanced ideas regarding the duties of a wife and the rights of women&quot;.

From the mid-1890s, she lived in England at Great Maytham Hall—which had a large garden where she indulged her love for flowers—where she made her home for the next decade, although she continued annual transatlantic trips to the United States. Maytham Hall resembled a feudal manor house which enchanted Burnett. She socialized in the local villages and enjoyed the country life. She filled the house with guests and had Stephen Townsend move in with her, which the local vicar considered a scandal. In February 1900 she married Townsend.

=== Remarriage and later life ===
The marriage took place in Genoa, Italy, and the couple went to Pegli for their honeymoon, where they endured two weeks of steady rain. Burnett&#x27;s biographer Gretchen Gerzina writes of the marriage, &quot;it was the biggest mistake of her life&quot;. The press stressed the age difference—Townsend was ten years younger than she—and she referred to him as her secretary. Biographer Ann Thwaite doubts Townsend loved Burnett, claiming that 50-year-old Burnett was &quot;stout, rouged and unhealthy&quot; - presuming that this would automatically impact the physical attraction - and believes Townsend needed Burnett to help with his acting career, and support him financially. Within months, in a letter to her sister, Burnett admitted the marriage was in trouble, describing Townsend as scarcely sane and hysterical. Thwaite argues that Townsend blackmailed Burnett into the marriage, and he just wanted her money and to be in control of her as a husband.

Unable to bear the thought of continuing to live with Townsend at Maytham, Burnett rented a house in London for the winter of 1900–1901. There she socialized with friends and wrote. She worked on two books simultaneously: &quot;The Shuttle&quot;, a longer and more complicated book; and &quot;The Making of a Marchioness&quot;, which she wrote in a few weeks and published to good reviews. In the spring of 1901, when she returned to the country, Townsend tried to replace her long-time publisher Scribner&#x27;s with a publishing house offering a larger advance. In the autumn of 1902, after a summer of socializing and filling Maytham with house-guests, she suffered a physical collapse. She returned to America, and in the winter of 1902 entered a sanatorium. There she told Townsend she would no longer live with him, and the marriage ended.

She returned to Maytham two years later in June 1904. Maytham Hall had a series of walled gardens and in the rose garden she wrote several books; it was there she had the idea for &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, mainly written at the manor house in Buile Hill Park while visiting Manchester. In 1905 &quot;A Little Princess&quot; was published, after she had reworked the play into a novel. Once again Burnett turned to writing to increase her income. She lived an extravagant lifestyle, spending money on expensive clothing. It was reported in 1905 that Burnett was a semi-vegetarian. She had eliminated meat almost entirely from her diet.

In 1907, she returned permanently to the United States, having become a citizen in 1905, and built a home, completed in 1908, in the Plandome Park section of Plandome Manor on Long Island outside New York City. Her son Vivian was employed in the publishing business, and at his request, she agreed to be an editor for &quot;Children&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Over the next several years she had published in &quot;Children&#x27;s Magazine&quot; several shorter works. In 1911 she had &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; published. In her later years she maintained the summer home on Long Island, and a winter home in Bermuda. &quot;The Lost Prince&quot; was published in 1915, and &quot;The Head of the House of Coombe&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Robin, &quot;were published in 1922.

Burnett lived for the last 17 years of her life in Plandome Manor, where she died on 29 October 1924, aged 74. She was buried in Roslyn Cemetery.

== Reception ==
During the serialization of &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; in &quot;St. Nicholas&quot; in 1885, readers looked forward to new installments. The fashions in the book became popular, with velvet Fauntleroy suits being sold; other Fauntleroy merchandise included velvet collars, playing cards, and chocolates. Sentimental fiction was then the norm, and &quot;rags to riches&quot; stories were popular in the United States; in time, however, &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; lost the popularity that &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; has retained.

Several of Burnett&#x27;s novels for adults were also very popular in their day, according to the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; list of bestselling novels in the United States. &quot;A Lady of Quality&quot; was second in 1896, &quot;The Shuttle&quot; was fourth in 1907 and fifth in 1908, &quot;T. Tembarom&quot; was tenth in 1913 and sixth in 1914, and &quot;The Head of the House of Coombe&quot; was fourth in 1922.

<text>James Lance Bass (; born May 4, 1979) is an American singer, actor, dancer, podcaster, and film and television producer. He grew up in Mississippi and rose to fame as the bass singer for the American pop boy band NSYNC. The band has sold over 70 million records, becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. NSYNC&#x27;s success led Bass to work in film and television.

He starred in the 2001 film &quot;On the Line&quot;, which his company, Bacon &amp; Eggs, also produced. Bass later formed a second production company, Lance Bass Productions, as well as a now-defunct music management company, Free Lance Entertainment, a joint venture with Mercury Records.

After completion of NSYNC&#x27;s PopOdyssey Tour, Bass moved to Star City, Russia, in a much publicized pursuit of a space tourism seat on a Soyuz space capsule. Bass was certified by both NASA and the Russian Space Program after several months of cosmonaut training and planned to join the TMA-1 mission to the International Space Station. However, after his financial sponsors backed out, Bass was denied a seat on the mission.

In July 2006, Bass came out as gay in a cover story for &quot;People&quot; magazine. He was awarded the Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award in October 2006 and released an autobiography, &quot;Out of Sync&quot;, in October 2007, which debuted on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Early life and education==
James Lance Bass was born in Laurel, Mississippi, to James Irvin Bass Jr., a medical technologist, and Diane (née Pulliam), a middle school mathematics, English, and career discovery teacher. Along with his older sister, Stacy, Bass grew up in adjacent Ellisville, Mississippi, and was raised as a Southern Baptist. Bass has described his family as devoutly Christian and conservative and has said that his childhood was &quot;extremely happy&quot;.

As a young boy, Bass developed an interest in space, and at age 9 traveled to Cape Canaveral, Florida, with his father to watch his first live Space Shuttle launch. Of this experience, Bass said, &quot;I was certain from then on that my future was to be involved with space.&quot; Shortly after, Bass attended space camp in Titusville, Florida, and aspired to attend college and study engineering, with the hope that he would one day work for NASA.

When Bass was 11 years old, his father was transferred to a different hospital, and the family moved to Clinton, Mississippi. Bass began singing in his Baptist church choir and was encouraged to audition for local performance groups by his childhood best friend, Darren Dale, the youngest child of former longtime Mississippi Insurance Commissioner George Dale. Bass joined the Mississippi Show Stoppers, a statewide music group sponsored by the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum, and the Attaché Show Choir, a national-award-winning competitive show choir group at Clinton High School. He was also a member of a seven-man vocal group named Seven Card Stud, which competed at state fairs and performed at several social and political events for Senator Trent Lott.

At Clinton High School, Bass was elected vice president of his junior class and has said that he performed well in math and science. However, Bass later said that his primary focus during high school was singing, and when reflecting on it, he remembers &quot;hardly anything&quot; about academia.

==Career==

===Music===
====NSYNC====

In 1995, during his junior year of high school, Bass received a call from Justin Timberlake and his mother, Lynn Harless, who asked Bass if he would be interested in auditioning for the pop group NSYNC after the group&#x27;s original bass singer, Jason Galasso, had quit. Timberlake&#x27;s vocal coach (who had worked with Bass during his time as a Mississippi Show Stopper) recommended Bass as a replacement. Bass was accepted into the group after auditioning in front of the other bandmembers, and soon left school to move to Orlando, Florida and rehearse full-time. Bass has said that he did not know how to dance before he joined NSYNC, and therefore found much of the group&#x27;s choreography difficult to learn.

According to an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Driven&quot;, Jan Bolz, president of BMG&#x27;s German division, offered NSYNC a recording contract under the condition that they replace Bass, whose dancing, he felt, &quot;wasn&#x27;t at the same level as all the others.&quot; However, Chris Kirkpatrick (who formed the band) refused to accept the contract without Bass. The group&#x27;s manager, Johnny Wright, convinced Bolz that Bass&#x27;s dancing would quickly improve. Bolz conceded, and the group soon moved to Munich, Germany to record their first album with BMG. NSYNC began extensive touring in Europe, and Bass&#x27;s mother quit her job to tour with the group as a chaperone, as Bass was still a minor.

After gaining significant notability in Europe, NSYNC was signed to the American record label RCA in 1997. The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;I Want You Back&quot; began receiving major radio play in the United States, and NSYNC soon found themselves becoming an &quot;overnight sensation&quot;, a period which Bass describes in his autobiography as &quot;the death of my own innocence&quot;. Along with increasing fame and recognition in the United States, the band also experienced a highly publicized legal battle with Lou Pearlman, who originally put the band together, due to what the group believed were illicit business practices on his part.

NSYNC sued Pearlman and his record company, Trans Continental, for defrauding the group of more than 50% of their earnings, rather than his original promise of receiving only one-sixth of the profits. The group threatened to leave and sign with Jive Records, which prompted Pearlman and RCA to countersue NSYNC for $150 million US, citing breach of contract. The injunction was thrown out of court and, after winning back their earnings, NSYNC signed with Jive.

In March 2000, NSYNC released &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, which became the fastest-selling record of all time, selling 1.1 million copies in its first day of release. In 2001, the group followed up with their &quot;Celebrity&quot; album, which scored the second highest first-week album sales ever, trumped only by the group&#x27;s previous album. NSYNC went on to sell over 56 million records worldwide. In 2002, the group announced that they would be taking a &quot;hiatus&quot;, during which Timberlake began to record solo material. NSYNC has not recorded new material since, and Bass has stated that he feels the group has officially disbanded.

In 2007, Bass said he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake&#x27;s 2004 decision to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has also said he has little hope for a reunion since Timberlake has &quot;made it clear that he wouldn&#x27;t be interested in discussing another album any time soon.&quot; Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: &quot;At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I&#x27;m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don&#x27;t hate him at all. And I understand what he was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us.&quot;

In September 2023, a new NSYNC song, &quot;Better Place&quot; was announced following a reunion of the band at the MTV Video Music Awards. The song, part of the soundtrack to the film &quot;Trolls Band Together&quot;, was released September 29.

====Free Lance Entertainment====
In 2000, Bass formed a music management company named Free Lance Entertainment, which was a joint venture with Mercury Nashville, a division of Mercury Records. Vowing to keep the company &quot;a strictly family-run operation&quot;, Bass employed his parents and sister as talent scouts, and he recruited childhood friend and aspiring country singer Meredith Edwards for the company&#x27;s first release. Edwards began touring with NSYNC as an opening act in the fall of 2000, and Bass teamed up with MTV to hold a nationwide talent search for more artists later that year. However, Free Lance soon folded after disappointing sales of Edwards&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Reach&quot;.

===Acting===
====Film and television====
Bass guest-starred on The WB drama series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, playing Rick Palmer, a love interest for Beverley Mitchell&#x27;s character, Lucy. The following year, while NSYNC was in the midst of recording &quot;Celebrity&quot;, Bass received his first starring role in the 2001 motion picture &quot;On the Line.&quot; Bass played Kevin, a man who falls in love with a woman on a Chicago train and begins a search to find her again.

The film was produced by Bass&#x27;s production company, A Happy Place (later renamed Bacon &amp; Eggs), and it featured appearances by Jerry Stiller, Al Green, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, former WWE wrestler Chyna, and Bass&#x27;s bandmates Timberlake, Kirkpatrick and Fatone, the latter in a major role. The film also featured a soundtrack which included previously unreleased songs by NSYNC and Britney Spears. Bass collaborated with Joey Fatone, Mandy Moore, Christian Burns and True Vibe (as the &quot;On the Line Allstars&quot;) for the film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;On the Line&quot;.

Despite heavy marketing towards NSYNC teen fans, the film was a commercial failure, grossing only US$4.2 million domestically despite its $10-million budget. The film, along with Bass&#x27;s acting, was also poorly received by critics. Bass later said he felt the film&#x27;s success was greatly hindered by its release date, which came one week after the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001. In his 2007 autobiography, Bass wrote, &quot;That was it our film was finished... once the country went to war, there was no way our film was going to be on anyone&#x27;s top-priority list.&quot;

After &quot;On the Line&quot;, Bass appeared in &quot;Zoolander&quot; and Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Cursed&quot; as himself, and he played a wedding singer in &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot;. Bass has also lent his voice to several animated television programs, such as &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, &quot;Handy Manny&quot; and &quot;Higglytown Heroes&quot;. Bass made an appearance in the 2008 film &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;. As a guest star in the 2013 &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; episode &quot;Boyz Crazy&quot;, Bass plays in the boy band, Sev&#x27;ral Timez (which is a parody of NSYNC). In 2014, Bass guest starred on an episode of the Comedy Central series &quot;Review&quot;, in which he visited space along with the show&#x27;s lead character.

Bass voiced the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; character Sephiroth in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;.

====Broadway====
On August 14, 2007, Bass began a six-month stint playing Corny Collins in the Broadway musical &quot;Hairspray&quot;, coinciding with the play&#x27;s five-year stage anniversary. He ended his run in &quot;Hairspray&quot; on January 6, 2008.

====Media Personality/Game, Reality, and Talk Shows====
In 2015, Bass joined season two of &quot;The Meredith Vieira Show&quot; as a full-time contributing panelist.

Bass and his mother competed in 2017 with other duos in the FOX reality cooking series &quot;My Kitchen Rules&quot;, and were the runners-up.

In 2020, Lance appeared with friend Joey Fatone on Meredith Vieira&#x27;s syndicated program, &quot;25 Words or Less&quot; (season 1, episodes 121–123).

In April 2021, Bass became a panelist for the new TV series &quot;Unicorn Hunters&quot;, a business investment show where he and other judges determine whether or not to invest in start-ups and other companies with high valuation potential.

===Radio===
Bass hosted &quot;Dirty Pop with Lance Bass&quot;, a daily evening drive time radio show focusing on pop culture and entertainment news on OutQ, an LGBT-geared station on Sirius XM. Bass was also the host of the weekly &quot;Pop2Kountdown&quot; on Pop2K, which counts down the 30 biggest hits from that week from a different year in the 2000s.

===Podcast===
On January 3, 2023, Bass released the trailer for his podcast, &quot;Frosted Tips with Lance Bass&quot;. The first episode aired on January 9, 2023, in which he interviewed former bandmate JC Chasez of NSYNC.

In February, he began releasing episodes for another podcast, &quot;The Last Soviet&quot;, describing the story of Sergei Krikalev&#x27;s time on the Mir space station during the collapse of the Soviet Union as well as Bass&#x27;s own experience training at Star City.

===&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===

Bass was a contestant on season 7 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and was paired with swing dance champ Lacey Schwimmer. Bass and Schwimmer reached the grand finale in competition and finished in third place.


==Production company==
In January 2001, Bass formed his first film production company, A Happy Place, with film producers Rich Hull, Wendy Thorlakson and Joe Anderson. The company was geared towards family-friendly films and received the Movieguide award for &quot;Excellence in Family-Oriented Programming&quot; for its first feature film, &quot;On the Line&quot;. After &quot;On the Line&quot;, A Happy Place changed its name to Bacon &amp; Eggs and produced its second feature film, &quot;Lovewrecked&quot;, in 2005. The film debuted on ABC Family in January 2007, starring Amanda Bynes, Chris Carmack, and Jamie-Lynn Sigler, with Bass in a minor role. This too received mostly negative reviews.

Bass later formed a separate production company named Lance Bass Productions. On May 14, 2007, Brian Graden announced that Lance Bass Productions would be working with the Logo network in executive producing a reality television show about the music business. It was reported that the show will focus on the creation and development of an all-gay boy band. To date no such project has been developed or aired.

In 2008, Bass co-produced &quot;The Grand&quot;, and Bass&#x27; company is reported to be developing a music docudrama about the life of rock bands on tour.

In October 2011, Bass debuted his own boy band called Heart2Heart. In August 2013, Bass became an executive producer of the documentary film &quot;Kidnapped for Christ&quot; along with Mike C. Manning. The film sheds light on controversial behavior modification methods used on children, sent there by their parents, at an Evangelical Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic. The film was sold to Showtime, to be released on television July 10, 2014.

==Personal life==
Bass dated actress Danielle Fishel of TV&#x27;s &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; throughout 1999 and 2000. Fishel said she was heavily invested in the relationship, commenting that she was &quot;so in love&quot; with Bass. Bass ended the relationship after one year and continued to exclusively date women until he was 22.

In his autobiography, Bass documents two gay relationships that predated media speculation; one with someone from Miami, Florida, named Jesse, with whom Bass lived for two years, and another with an Idaho native named Joe. Bass began dating &quot;Amazing Race&quot; winner Reichen Lehmkuhl in early 2006, a courtship that garnered tabloid coverage and led to Bass&#x27;s decision to come out. Bass described his relationship with Lehmkuhl as &quot;very stable&quot;; however, the couple split up several months later. Shortly after his split with Lehmkuhl, Bass briefly dated Brazilian model and LXTV host Pedro Andrade. From August 2007 to March 2008, Bass dated New York-based hairdresser Ben Thigpen. After a year and a half of dating, Bass became engaged to Michael Turchin in September 2013. Bass and Turchin married on December 20, 2014, in Los Angeles.

In a 2006 interview, Bass said he has Attention-Deficit Disorder. In August 2024, he made it known that he has type 1.5 diabetes, which had been misdiagnosed a few years earlier as type 2. Bass&#x27;s favorite music bands are Aerosmith, the Goo Goo Dolls, and Journey, and his favorite actress is Lucille Ball, whom he grew up watching on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; re-runs. He is a self-described &quot;huge Dr. Seuss fan&quot;, devoting an entire room in his Jackson, Mississippi, estate to Seuss memorabilia. Bass has said he is a Christian and that he regularly attends church, though he considers himself to be non-denominational. He is the godfather of former bandmate and best friend Joey Fatone&#x27;s daughters, Briahna and Kloey.

===Sexual orientation===

Bass came out as gay in a cover story for &quot;People&quot; magazine on July 26, 2006. There had been considerable media speculation about his orientation due to numerous paparazzi snapshots of him at gay bars and nightclubs, most notably during the preceding Independence Day weekend in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton had also been posting items on his website about Bass&#x27;s orientation since September 2005, and New York gossip column &quot;Page Six&quot; ran a blurb on July 12, 2006, that reported a sighting of Bass at a gay bar with his then-boyfriend, Lehmkuhl. Bass&#x27;s publicist, Ken Sunshine, chose to release the story exclusively to &quot;People&quot; magazine, who bumped actor Johnny Depp off that week&#x27;s cover in favor of Bass. In his coming out interview, Bass stated,

Bass&#x27;s announcement received a large amount of media attention. The American public&#x27;s reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving &quot;overwhelming support&quot; from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to &#x27;N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as &quot;straight-acting&quot; in his &quot;People&quot; interview, stating, &quot;I call them the SAGs the straight-acting gays. We&#x27;re just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer.&quot; This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not &#x27;normal&#x27;, but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Bass called his comment a &quot;mistake&quot; and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, &quot;Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It&#x27;s a touchy community because it&#x27;s the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed.&quot;

Bass found himself in the midst of further controversy later that year when he, along with then-boyfriend Reichen Lehmkuhl, was awarded 2006 Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award on October 7, 2006. The &quot;Washington Blade&quot; printed a guest editorial from a longtime HRC supporter who claimed that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and that The Human Rights Campaign was simply capitalizing on Bass&#x27;s fame to sell tickets. The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award, responding to critics by saying, &quot;Bass is the biggest music star since Melissa Etheridge to come out, and maybe some people think HRC should just ignore these moments of cultural significance, but his declaration did initiate a positive, national conversation that continues today.&quot;

===Marriage and family===

Bass began dating painter and actor Michael Turchin in January 2011 and they became engaged in September 2013. They married on December 20, 2014, at the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. Former NSYNC bandmates Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and JC Chasez were in attendance; Justin Timberlake, who was then headlining his The 20/20 Experience World Tour, was not present. The ceremonial event was filmed and televised in a special E! presentation: &quot;Lance Loves Michael: The Lance Bass Wedding&quot; that aired on February 5, 2015. Bass and Turchin were the first same-sex couple to exchange vows on cable television. After four years of marriage, the couple decided to extend their family and have a child with the help of a surrogate. In March 2020, Bass announced the couple had lost a baby via the surrogate having a miscarriage at eight weeks. It had been the couple&#x27;s ninth surrogacy attempt. In June 2021, Bass announced they were expecting twins by early November. Their son and daughter were born in mid-October.

===Space tourism plans===
In February 2002, Lena Banks, a space advocate and founder/producer of Think Tank Ink Productions, contacted Bass to propose his involvement in her Youngest Person in Space project. Banks took her longtime associate David Krieff of Destiny Productions on board and through a series of events in August 2002, Bass entered cosmonaut training in Star City, Russia. Bass was considered as the host of a U.S. version of a space competition show, &quot;The Big Mission,&quot; that had been successful in Denmark; contestants would go through rigorous training and vie for a seat on a Russian Soyuz space capsule. Instead of a game show, the producers decided to shoot a documentary of a celebrity training and going into space, intending to air it on a major network.

A colleague mentioned Banks&#x27; space project to a friend, whose daughter shouted out, &quot;Lance Bass wants to go into space!&quot; The girl, who was an NSYNC fan, learned of Bass&#x27; lifelong dream of space travel when she read of it online via an MTV forum. Banks spoke to Bass&#x27;s management who went to him with the proposal. &quot;At first he thought we were joking,&quot; Banks remarks. &quot;I assured him it was for real; he accepted and we moved forward with the project.&quot;

To be admitted into training, Bass had to go through strenuous physicals that may have saved his life. It was discovered he had cardiac arrhythmia, and he agreed to undergo heart surgery to correct it. In 1999, he had gone to the hospital while on tour for what he thought was a stomach virus, and while there, the doctors detected his heart problem.

After several months of training, Bass received cosmonaut certification and went on to Houston&#x27;s Johnson Space Center (JSC) to take part in astronaut training. He was scheduled to fly into space on the Soyuz TMA-1 mission that was to be launched on October 30, 2002. The capsule was to fly to the International Space Station and land in a desert in Kazakhstan.

But the original deal to air the documentary about Bass fell through in mid-2002. Bass&#x27;s camp turned to MTV, who agreed to sponsor the trip but then backed out over &quot;payment, insurance, and indemnification issues.&quot; Shortly after, all of Bass&#x27;s other sponsorships fell through, including one sponsor who pulled out because they worried about their brand being tarnished if Bass were to die on the mission. Bass was eventually rejected from the program, and was replaced on the flight by Russian cosmonauts Yury Lonchakov and Sergei Zalyotin and Belgium&#x27;s Frank De Winne.

====Space advocacy====
In 2003, Bass began serving as World Space Week&#x27;s Youth Spokesman. Bass has said that he believes young people becoming more interested in space exploration &quot;will help the future of our planet&quot;. From 2003 to 2005, Bass spent World Space Week traveling to American high schools speaking with students about space exploration and encouraging them to explore careers in science and mathematics. Bass is a member of the National Space Society, a non-profit educational space advocacy organization founded by Wernher von Braun. Bass has served on the National Space Society&#x27;s board of governors since October 2004, alongside other space advocates such as actor Tom Hanks and author and futurist Sir Arthur C. Clarke. In a 2007 interview with &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, Bass said he &quot;absolutely&quot; still intends on going to space, and that he hopes to work on a space documentary. Bass has also retained fluency in Russian, which he was required to learn during his training.

===Autobiography===

Following public response surrounding his coming out, Bass announced that he was releasing an autobiography. The book, entitled &quot;Out of Sync&quot;, was published on October 23, 2007. It was co-written by &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-selling biographer Marc Eliot, who also wrote the book&#x27;s introduction, and was published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster. The 208-page book covers what Bass describes as &quot;the first chapter&quot; in his life, from his childhood growing up in rural Mississippi, to his efforts to obtain a seat on a Russian space capsule and the proceeding financial issues he had with his sponsors, and culminating with Bass&#x27;s decision to go public with his sexuality. The book includes details about boyfriends that he kept from family and friends. He recounts NSYNC&#x27;s 2002 decision to go on an &quot;extended hiatus&quot;. Bass said Justin Timberlake was the sole reason NSYNC did not get back together. &quot;Out of Sync&quot; debuted on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for the week of November 11, 2007.

===Philanthropy and causes===
Bass has been involved with a number of charities. In 2001, he founded The Lance Bass Foundation, a non-profit organization that was designed to meet the health needs of low-income children. In 2003, Bass donated $30,000 US to establish the Amber Pulliam Special Education Endowment at the University of Southern Mississippi. Named for his younger cousin, Amber Pulliam, who has Down syndrome, it serves financial aid students from Mississippi&#x27;s Pine Belt who plan a career in special education.

After 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Katrina, Bass launched &quot;uBid For Hurricane Relief&quot;, a celebrity auction to benefit victims of the hurricane, with uBid.com. Proceeds from the auction were split between the Child Welfare League of America, The Brett Favre Fourward Foundation, and Ashton Kutcher&#x27;s RockWorks Foundation. Many of Bass&#x27;s family members in Mississippi were directly affected by the hurricane. That same year, Bass appeared on an episode of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; with a donation to a Russian woman to save a camp for disabled children in Russia.

Bass is a member of the Environmental Media Association&#x27;s board of directors. He has also been involved with Animal Avengers, Shannon Elizabeth&#x27;s animal rescue organization. He has two dogs which he adopted from a rescue shelter, both of whom he posed with in a PETA ad urging people to adopt rather than buy animals. In August 2007, Bass wrote a guest commentary for LOGO&#x27;s &quot;Visible Vote &#x27;08&quot; blog, in which he expressed support for gay marriage. In September 2007, Bass participated in a series of GLAAD television advertisements promoting tolerance for the LGBT community. Bass has also been involved in fundraising for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
