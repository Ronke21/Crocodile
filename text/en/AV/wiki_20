<text>Danzig is an American heavy metal band led by former Samhain and Misfits singer Glenn Danzig. Formed in 1987 in Lodi, New Jersey, the group early on became a unique voice in the rock scene, playing a bluesy, doom-laden metal with Glenn Danzig crooning in the style of Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley. After a major hit with a live version of its 1988 song &quot;Mother&quot;, the band experimented with industrial music but later returned to heavy metal. As of 2023, Danzig has released 12 studio albums (two consisting entirely of cover versions), two EPs, one live album, and one compilation album.

==History==
===Beginnings (1986–1987)===
On July 14, 1986, Samhain performed at The Ritz in New York in what proved to be their final show. In attendance was producer Rick Rubin, who was scouting bands to sign to his record label, Def Jam Recordings. Rubin initially expressed interest in signing only Glenn Danzig, intending to make him vocalist for a hard rock supergroup that Rubin envisioned. However, Danzig refused to sign unless Samhain&#x27;s bassist Eerie Von was also signed. In 1987, Rubin added John Christ on guitar and Chuck Biscuits (ex-Black Flag) on drums. To reflect the change in musical direction and avoid having to start anew after future lineup changes, Glenn, on Rubin&#x27;s advice, changed the name of Samhain to his surname, Danzig. The first release from the band, minus Eerie Von, was the song &quot;You And Me (Less than Zero)&quot; from the &quot;Less than Zero&quot; soundtrack and credited as Glenn Danzig &amp; The Power and Fury Orchestra.

===&quot;Classic&quot; era (1988–1993)===
In 1988, Danzig released its self-titled debut album on Def American (later renamed to American Recordings). The band toured worldwide in support of the album throughout 1988 and 1989; they opened for Slayer on their &quot;South of Heaven&quot; tour in North America and Metallica on their &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; tour in Europe, and subsequently headlined their own tour, which included support from bands such as Murphy&#x27;s Law, Mudhoney, Accept, Armored Saint, Circus of Power, White Zombie, Sick of It All and Carnivore. &quot;Danzig&quot; is the band&#x27;s best-selling album, having been certified gold in the U.S. in 1994, and eventually going platinum.

In 1990, Danzig released its second album, &quot;Danzig II: Lucifuge&quot;. By 1992, Rubin&#x27;s involvement with the band had waned. Danzig himself took credit for co-producing the third album, &quot;Danzig III: How the Gods Kill&quot;. In the following year, the band released the &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot; EP, which contained several live tracks from the band&#x27;s 1992 Halloween show as well as three new studio tracks. The live version of &quot;Mother&quot;, a song from the first album, became popular on album-oriented radio stations while its music video received considerable attention on MTV-programmed shows such as &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. The band were eventually awarded in the fall of 1994 with two gold albums for the exceptional sales of their first record and &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot;. The renewed popularity of &quot;Mother&quot; not only helped raise Danzig&#x27;s profile in the music industry, but also saw the band starting to perform at larger venues such as arenas and amphitheaters, which included headlining US tours with bands like White Zombie, Kyuss, Type O Negative, Godflesh and then-emerging acts Korn and Marilyn Manson, as well as opening for Metallica and Black Sabbath.

=== &quot;Industrial&quot; era (1994–1999) ===
On October 4, 1994, &quot;Danzig 4&quot; was released. The album sold well, but did not contain a hit on par with the &quot;Mother&quot; single. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Cantspeak&quot;, was also a staple in MTV&#x27;s rotation, but unlike &quot;Mother&quot; failed to appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Cantspeak&quot; is the band&#x27;s only single other than &quot;Mother&quot; to chart on Billboard. Amid accusations of unpaid royalties and broken promises, Danzig&#x27;s relationship with Rubin deteriorated and the band left the record label.

Around this time, the band&#x27;s lineup began to dissolve as well. First, Chuck Biscuits left the band in the summer of 1994 due to royalty disagreements. According to a special issue of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl turned down an approach by the band. Biscuits was replaced by Joey Castillo, who made his first public appearance as a member of Danzig at an in-store signing the day of the fourth album&#x27;s release. Coincidentally, Castillo would later replace Grohl in Queens of the Stone Age. Although the band had toured successfully with its new drummer during the fall and winter of 1994–95, by the spring of 1995 Danzig was actively seeking a new guitarist, with Pepper Keenan and Dez Cadena considered possible replacements. John Christ and Eerie Von resigned on July 5, 1995.

In October 1996, &quot;Danzig 5: Blackacidevil&quot; was released. The album was mostly a solo effort by Danzig, although Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains played lead guitar on three of the album&#x27;s tracks. Joey Castillo played drums, the sole member still in the band from the 4p Tour. Castillo would record on two more Danzig albums, making him the longest-standing member outside of the original lineup.

For the next few years, Danzig was tied up in a legal battle with Rubin over the rights to unreleased material the band recorded for American Recordings. In November 1999, Danzig &quot;6:66 Satan&#x27;s Child&quot; was released. A long-planned Samhain box set was also released, followed by a Samhain reunion tour. Samhain opened for Danzig for six weeks during the tour and consisted of Steve Zing and London May switching between bass and drums.

===Return to form (2000–2011)===
By 2000, Danzig&#x27;s lineup had stabilized with the addition of guitarist Todd Youth and bassist Howie Pyro, both veterans of the New York City punk scene. In 2002, this lineup released the album &quot;Danzig 777: I Luciferi&quot;. In 2004, Danzig released their eighth studio album, &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot;, with the line up featuring Tommy Victor of Prong on guitar, who had toured as a member of Danzig years earlier.

Soon after the album&#x27;s release, Danzig undertook the Blackest of the Black tour across the US, replacing &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; drummer Bevan Davies with Johnny Kelly (of Type O Negative).

Throughout 2006, Glenn Danzig stated in several interviews that he had grown tired of the touring cycle and did not expect to partake in any more large-scale tours. Instead, Danzig would go on small, localized tours, such as the 10 west coast dates they played for the 2006 Blackest of the Black tour. This tour debuted Kenny Hickey (of Type O Negative) as the band&#x27;s new guitarist, while the East Coast dates saw the addition of former Samhain member, Steve Zing on bass.

In October 2006, Glenn Danzig released &quot;Black Aria II&quot;, the follow-up to his solo classical album, &quot;Black Aria&quot;. &quot;Black Aria&quot; was re-released by Evilive in May 2007. He spent the rest of the year completing the production and packaging of &quot;The Lost Tracks of Danzig&quot;, a double CD containing 26 unreleased songs that span the entire Danzig catalog, which was released on July 10, 2007. Danzig has also stated that he plans to record a dark blues album with either Jerry Cantrell or Hank Williams III.

In August 2008, Glenn Danzig announced that Danzig (the band) would do a 20th-anniversary tour, celebrating the release of their self-titled debut album. This was the band&#x27;s first full US tour in three years, which also included stops in Canada and Mexico. Also asked in August 2008 if the ninth Danzig album was planned, Glenn Danzig replied:
On December 26, 2009, Danzig performed at the Starland Ballroom in New Jersey. The show was notable for featuring a special appearance by Michale Graves who, along with Doyle and Dr. Chud, performed several songs by the reformed version of the Misfits.

On March 10, 2010, a Danzig lyric book was released, titled &quot;Hidden Lyrics of the Left Hand&quot;. The book contains unreleased song lyrics combined with illustrations by Simon Bisley.

Danzig released &quot;Deth Red Sabaoth&quot;, their ninth studio album, on June 22, 2010. It is the band&#x27;s first proper studio album in six years, since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot;. Both Tommy Victor and Johnny Kelly appeared on the record.

In 2009, movie director Todd Phillips chose Danzig&#x27;s song &quot;Thirteen&quot; to open his film &quot;The Hangover&quot;. Danzig later recorded a new song, &quot;Black Hell&quot;, to appear in the 2011 sequel, &quot;The Hangover: Part II&quot;.

In January 2011, Danzig was announced for the 2011 Download Festival at Donington Park, England, alongside bands including Rob Zombie, Alice Cooper, and System of a Down. On the first day of the festival, Danzig headlined the Pepsi Max stage. On June 12, 2011, Danzig played at the Nova Rock Festival.

On October 25, 2011, a greatest hits album entitled &quot;The Essential Danzig&quot; was to be released through Sony BMG. However, as of 2017, this has yet to happen, nor have details of the release been given.

October 2011 also saw a rare string of reunion shows called the &quot;Danzig Legacy&quot; tour. The shows consisted of a Danzig mini-set, followed by a Samhain mini-set, a set of Danzig and Doyle performing Misfits songs, and then ending with three Danzig songs and the performance of &quot;Skulls&quot;.

=== Recent activity (2012–present) ===
In May 2012, Danzig released the song &quot;Devil&#x27;s Angels&quot;, the theme from the 1967 film of the same name, from &quot;Skeletons&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve wanted to record this song since 1979 and this is exactly the same arrangement I had for it back then, so it pretty much sounds like that late 70s style of mine. I&#x27;m really happy with the way it turned out, it actually came out much better than I had hoped it would. We&#x27;re going to be playing it live on these upcoming shows.&quot;

In April 2013, Glenn Danzig told Full Metal Jackie that he would begin work on new Danzig material with Tommy Victor and Johnny Kelly after the 25th anniversary tour. In February 2014, the band began recording three new songs for their 10th studio album of original material. The resulting album, &quot;Black Laden Crown&quot;, was released on May 26, 2017 on Nuclear Blast and AFM Records.

On September 4, 2015, Danzig released a 7&quot; vinyl single, limited to 500 copies, of &quot;Devil&#x27;s Angels&quot; to promote the covers album, &quot;Skeletons&quot;.

In October 2015, Glenn Danzig appeared on Sirius XM to debut the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; from the tentatively titled &quot;Danzig Sings Elvis&quot; album. In July 2016, the band&#x27;s official Facebook page confirmed that &quot;Danzig Sings Elvis&quot; was finished; however, the album was not released until April 24, 2020.

When asked in May 2020 by Billboard.com about the possibility of another Danzig album with all-new material, Glenn Danzig said, &quot;For now, people are going to have to be happy with the &quot;Danzig Sings Elvis&quot; record, and I&#x27;ll see in a couple years if I feel like recording another. If something comes in my mind, maybe I&#x27;ll do another. Maybe I&#x27;ll just give it away for free or something. I don&#x27;t know. But as long as I&#x27;m having a good time, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.&quot;

In May 2023, Glenn Danzig unveiled a series of live performance dates in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the self-titled debut album. The band played the album in its entirety for these concerts.

<doc id="159492" wikidata="Q354654" url="?curid=159492" title="Glenn Danzig">
<text>Glenn Allen Anzalone (born June 23, 1955), better known by his stage name Glenn Danzig, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, actor, film director and record producer. He is the founder of the rock bands Misfits, Samhain, and Danzig. He owns the Evilive record label as well as Verotik, an adult-oriented comic book publishing company.

Beginning in the mid-1970s, Danzig&#x27;s musical career has encompassed a number of genres through the years, including punk rock and heavy metal, and incorporating influences from industrial, blues and classical music. He has also written songs for other musicians, most notably Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison.

As a singer, Danzig is noted for his baritone voice and tenor vocal range; his style has been compared to those of Elvis Presley, Jim Morrison, and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Danzig has also cited Bill Medley as a vocal influence. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Glenn Danzig at number 199 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Early life==
Danzig was born Glenn Allen Anzalone, the third of four sons, in Lodi, New Jersey. His father was a television repairman and a United States Marine Corps veteran of World War II and the Korean War. His mother worked at a record store. Danzig and his family also spent some time living in Revere, Massachusetts. Danzig began listening to heavy metal music at an early age, and has described Black Sabbath, the Ramones, Blue Cheer, and The Doors as being among his early musical influences.

At age 10, Danzig began to use drugs and alcohol, leading him into frequent fights and trouble with the law. He stopped using drugs at age 15.

While growing up, Danzig began reading the works of authors including Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe, developing his appreciation for horror. Danzig collected comic books and, frustrated by American comics, he started his own company to produce &quot;crazy, violent, erotic comics&quot;.

Danzig graduated from Lodi High School in June 1973, aspiring to become a comic book creator and professional photographer. He attended the Tisch School of the Arts and later the New York Institute of Photography. Danzig formed an adult-oriented comic book company called Verotik in the mid-1990s.

==Musical career==
===Early career===
Glenn Danzig&#x27;s introduction to performing music began when he took piano and clarinet lessons as a child. He later taught himself how to play the guitar. Danzig started in the music business at the age of 11, first as a drum roadie and then playing in local garage bands. He had never taken vocal lessons, but his self-taught vocal prowess gained him attention in the local scene. Throughout his teenage years he sang for several local bands, such as Talus and Koo-Dot-N-Boo-Jang, most of which played half original songs and half Black Sabbath songs.

===Misfits and Samhain (1977–1986)===

In the mid-1970s, Danzig started the Misfits, releasing the band&#x27;s records through his own label (originally known as Blank, later as Plan 9). Danzig had attempted to get the Misfits signed to several record labels, only to be told that he would never have a career in music. The impetus for the band&#x27;s name comes from Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s last film, combined with Danzig considering himself to be a &quot;social misfit&quot;. The band released several singles and two albums, spawning a cult following. Danzig disbanded the Misfits in October 1983 due to personal and professional differences. He later explained, &quot;It was difficult for me to work with those guys, because they weren&#x27;t prepared to put in the hours practicing. I wanted to move things forward, and they didn&#x27;t seem to have the same outlook.&quot;

Before the disbanding of the Misfits, Danzig had begun working on a new band project, Samhain, which began when he started rehearsing with Eerie Von (formerly of Rosemary&#x27;s Babies). Danzig took the name of the band from the ancient Celtic New Year (which influenced the evolution of the modern Halloween). Initially Samhain was conceived as a punk rock &quot;super group&quot;. The band briefly featured members of Minor Threat and Reagan Youth, who contributed to Samhain&#x27;s 1984 debut, &quot;Initium&quot;. The band then settled with a lineup consisting of Eerie Von on bass, Damien on guitar, and Steve Zing on drums (later replaced by London May). In 1985 the &quot;Unholy Passion&quot; EP was released, followed by &quot;November-Coming-Fire&quot; in 1986.

Samhain eventually attracted the interest of major labels including Epic and Elektra. Rick Rubin, music producer and head of the Def Jam label, would see the band perform at the 1986 New Music Seminar, on the advice of then-Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Danzig has credited both Burton and Metallica frontman James Hetfield with helping to raise awareness about his music: &quot;I first met them at a Black Flag gig, and then we became kinda friends. We&#x27;d often bump into each other on the road...James and Cliff helped to spread the word about me, and I was very grateful to them.&quot;

===Danzig===
====&quot;Classic&quot; era (1986–1994)====
In 1986, after two albums and an EP, Samhain was signed to a major label by Rubin and the name of the band was changed to Danzig to allow the band to retain its name in the event of line-up changes. Danzig discussed the reasoning behind the name change: &quot;Rick [Rubin] convinced me it was the way to go, and would also provide me with a lot more artistic freedom. After all, I was now in charge of where we were going musically, so if I didn&#x27;t want to do something, it was a lot easier to say so.&quot; Danzig&#x27;s intention at the time was for each album he recorded to consist of a different recording line-up, allowing him to keep working with different musicians. The original band consisted of guitarist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von, and former Circle Jerks–DOA–Black Flag drummer Chuck Biscuits.

In 1987, Danzig, owing to his association with Rubin, was asked to write a song for Roy Orbison. The result was &quot;Life Fades Away&quot;, featured in the 1987 movie &quot;Less than Zero&quot;. Danzig also contributed to the film&#x27;s soundtrack with &quot;You and Me (Less than Zero)&quot;. Danzig had originally been asked to write the song for a female vocalist, but when Rubin could not find a suitable singer, Danzig recorded the vocals himself. The song is credited to Glenn Danzig and the Power Fury Orchestra, which featured the same membership as the initial lineup of Danzig, with the exception of Eerie Von. Since Von did not like the way producer Rubin wanted the bass played on the song, George Drakoulias played the bass instead.

In 1988, the newly formed band Danzig released their eponymous debut. Its sound showed a progression from the gothic–deathrock sound of Samhain, to a slower, heavier, more blues-based heavy metal sound.

In 1990, the band&#x27;s sophomore effort, &quot;Danzig II: Lucifuge&quot;, marked an immediate change in musical direction. The album&#x27;s overall bluesier tone and somewhat milder approach were departures from &quot;Danzig&quot;, featuring a &#x27;50s-style ballad (&quot;Blood &amp; Tears&quot;) and a full-on acoustic blues (&quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot;).

Other projects in 1990 included the final Samhain album, &quot;Final Descent&quot;. The album was started under the title &quot;Samhain Grim&quot; several years prior. The album contained previously unreleased studio recordings, at least some of which had been intended for the &quot;Samhain Grim&quot; album before it was aborted.

In 1992, Danzig again changed musical direction, releasing the darker &quot;Danzig III: How the Gods Kill&quot;. Several songs featured a more textured, slower sound between fast, dominant guitar riffs.

Also in 1992, Danzig tried his hand at composing classical music with &quot;Black Aria&quot;. The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard classical music chart.

In 1993, Danzig released &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot;, an EP featuring both studio recordings and live tracks. Danzig broke into the mainstream when the live video of &quot;Mother &#x27;93&quot; became a hit on MTV and earned Buzz Bin rotation, six years after the original song was recorded. During this time the band reached its commercial peak, with both the debut album and &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot; being certified Gold, and &quot;Mother&quot; becoming the band&#x27;s highest charting single. Both &quot;Danzig&quot; and &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot; have since been certified Platinum.

In 1994, the release of &quot;Danzig 4&quot; saw the band going further into a darker and more experimental sound. The album also saw further development of his vocal style and range, most notable in songs like &quot;Let It Be Captured&quot;, and a more blues-based approach on songs like &quot;Going Down to Die&quot;.

Also in 1994, Danzig&#x27;s song &quot;Thirteen&quot;, written for Johnny Cash, appeared on the latter musician&#x27;s album &quot;American Recordings&quot;.

====Later years (1995–2004)====

In 1996, the band underwent a complete overhaul. The original lineup had fallen apart, as had Glenn Danzig&#x27;s relationship with their record label, American Recordings, with label owner Rick Rubin&#x27;s involvement as producer diminishing with each album. Danzig would later engage in a legal battle with Rubin over unpaid royalties and the rights to the band&#x27;s unreleased songs. Danzig enlisted new bandmates, most notably Joey Castillo, who would be the band&#x27;s drummer until 2002.

Once again, he explored a new musical direction and recorded &quot;Blackacidevil&quot;, this time infusing heavy metal with industrial rock. Danzig went on to sign a deal with Hollywood Records, which led to several religious groups boycotting its parent company, Disney, for signing a controversial &quot;satanic&quot; band. As a result, the label pulled support for &quot;Blackacidevil&quot; and the record deal was severed.

In September 1999, Danzig signed his band to E-Magine Records, becoming the first artist on the label. The deal also led to the release of a Samhain box set and the re-release of &quot;Blackacidevil&quot;.

Danzig&#x27;s subsequent three albums, &quot;6:66 Satan&#x27;s Child&quot; (1999), &quot;I Luciferi&quot; (2002) and &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; (2004), all musically and lyrically evolved to a more stripped down, heavier gothic metal sound. The Danzig lineup continued to change with each album, while Danzig&#x27;s voice started to show change after years of touring.

In 1999, during the U.S. touring for the album &quot;6:66 Satan&#x27;s Child&quot; Danzig reunited Samhain along with drummers Steve Zing and London May. Then-Danzig guitarist Todd Youth was invited by Glenn Danzig to fill in the guitar position for the Samhain reunion tour, replacing Samhain&#x27;s original guitarist, Pete &quot;Damien&quot; Marshall, who had opted out in order to tour with Iggy Pop. Eerie Von was not invited to rejoin Samhain due to personal issues within the band. Both Zing and May handled bass duties, switching from drums to bass in between the &quot;Blood Show&quot;.

In 2003, Danzig founded the Blackest of the Black tour to provide a platform for dark and extreme bands of his choosing from around the world. Bands featured on the tour have included Dimmu Borgir, Superjoint Ritual, Nile, Opeth, Lacuna Coil, Behemoth, Skeletonwitch, Mortiis and Marduk.

==== Recent activity (2005–2011)====
In 2005, Danzig&#x27;s tours to support the &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; album and the Blackest of the Black Tour were highlighted by the special guest appearance of Misfits guitarist Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein. Doyle joined Danzig on stage for a 20-minute set of classic Misfits songs: &quot;To do this right, I invited Doyle to join Danzig on stage at &#x27;Blackest of the Black&#x27; for a special guest set. This is the first time we will be performing on stage together in 20 years. It&#x27;s the closest thing to a Misfits reunion anyone is ever going to see.&quot;

On October 17, 2006, he released his second solo album, &quot;Black Aria II&quot;. The album reached the top ten on the Billboard classical music chart.

In November 2006, Danzig toured the west coast with former Samhain drummer Steve Zing on bass. They played three Samhain songs including &quot;All Murder All Guts All Fun&quot;. In Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Doyle joined the band onstage for the encore and played two Misfits songs, &quot;Skulls&quot; and &quot;Astro Zombies&quot;.

In 2007 Danzig produced the debut album by ex-Misfits guitarist Doyle&#x27;s metal-influenced band, Gorgeous Frankenstein.

In July 2007, Danzig released &quot;The Lost Tracks of Danzig&quot;, a compilation of previously unreleased songs. The project took nine months to complete with Glenn Danzig having to add extra vocal and instrument tracks to songs that had been unfinished. The album included the controversial &quot;White Devil Rise&quot;, recorded during the sessions for &quot;Danzig 4&quot; in response to inflammatory comments by Louis Farrakhan and his use of the term &quot;The White Devil&quot;. The song is Danzig&#x27;s conjecture as to what would happen if Farrakhan incited the passive white race to rise up and start a race war: &quot;No one wants to see a race war. It would be terrible, so the song&#x27;s saying, &#x27;Be careful what you wish for. Danzig himself has bluntly denied any accusations of racism: &quot;As far as me being an Aryan or a racist, anyone who knows me knows that&#x27;s bullshit.&quot;

In October and November 2007, Danzig toured the western United States, along with Gorgeous Frankenstein, Horrorpops, and Suicide City. This &quot;3 Weeks of Halloween&quot; tour was in support of his most recent album, &quot;The Lost Tracks of Danzig&quot;, as well as the newest graphic novel release from Verotik, &quot;Drukija: Countessa of Blood&quot;. On October 23, 2007, Danzig was performing the song &quot;How the Gods Kill&quot; in Baltimore and fell off the stage, injuring his left arm. He did not perform the Misfits set that night, but he continued the tour and played classic Misfits tunes with Doyle onstage as an encore with a sling on his left arm after the injury.

In 2008, Danzig confirmed he had recorded the first duet of his career, with Melissa Auf der Maur. The song, titled &quot;Father&#x27;s Grave&quot;, features Danzig singing from the perspective of a gravedigger and appears on Auf der Maur&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Out of Our Minds&quot;. Auf der Maur has spoken highly about the experience of meeting and working with Danzig.

Danzig&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;Deth Red Sabaoth&quot;, was released on June 22, 2010.

In a July 2010 interview with Metal Injection, Glenn Danzig was asked if he was going to make another Danzig record after &quot;Deth Red Sabaoth&quot;. His response was, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, we&#x27;ll see. With the way record sales are now...I won&#x27;t do some stupid pro-tool record in someone&#x27;s living room where all the drum beats are stolen from somebody and just mashed together...and I&#x27;m not going to do that if I can&#x27;t do a record how I want to do it, and if it&#x27;s not financially feasible, I&#x27;m just not going to do one.&quot;

During the later quarter of 2011 Danzig performed a string of one-off reunion shows called the &quot;Danzig Legacy&quot; tour. The shows consisted of a Danzig set, followed by a Samhain set, then closing off with Danzig and Doyle performing Misfits songs.

During the third date of Metallica&#x27;s 30-year anniversary shows at the Fillmore Theater in San Francisco, Danzig went on stage with Metallica to perform the Misfits songs &quot;Die, Die My Darling&quot;, &quot;Last Caress&quot;, and &quot;Green Hell&quot;.

====Current activity (2012–present)====

Danzig has said he wishes to avoid extensive and exhaustive touring in the future, preferring instead to focus on his various music, film and comic book projects: &quot;I don&#x27;t really want to tour. My reason for not doing it is because I&#x27;m bored of it. I like being onstage, but I don&#x27;t like sitting around all day doing nothing. I could be home, working.&quot; Danzig has started work on a third &quot;Black Aria&quot; album, and a covers album is set for release by the end of 2013. Danzig hopes to record a dark blues album involving Jerry Cantrell and Hank III. He is currently working on new Danzig material with Tommy Victor and Johnny Kelly.

In 2014, Danzig filed a lawsuit against Misfits bassist Jerry Only claiming Only registered trademarks for everything Misfits-related in 2000 behind Danzig&#x27;s back, misappropriating exclusive ownership over the trademarks for himself, including the band&#x27;s iconic &quot;Fiend Skull&quot; logo, violating a 1994 contract the two had. Danzig claims that after registering the trademarks, Only secretly entered into deals with various merchandisers and cut him out of any potential profits in the process. On August 6, 2014, a U.S. district judge in California dismissed Danzig&#x27;s lawsuit.

On October 21, 2015, during an interview with Loudwire, Danzig stated his current tour with Superjoint could be his last.

On May 12, 2016, Danzig, Only, and Frankenstein announced they would perform together as the Misfits for the first time in 33 years in two headlining shows at the September 2016 Riot Fest in Chicago and Denver. He later noted that he would be &quot;open to possibly doing some more shows&quot;. The reunited Misfits did more shows and Danzig enforced a &quot;no cell phone&quot; policy at the reunion shows. The reunited &quot;Original Misfits&quot; sold out a succession of arenas, a singular accomplishment for a classic punk band, providing evidence that they are among the most popular punk bands ever.

Danzig returned to Riot Fest in 2017 with his band Danzig. Their album &quot;Black Laden Crown&quot; was released on May 26, 2017.

==Musical style==
Danzig&#x27;s musical career has encompassed a number of genres, from punk rock and heavy metal to classical music. He is noted for his baritone voice and tenor vocal range; his style has been compared to those of Elvis Presley, Jim Morrison, Roy Orbison and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Critic Mark Deming of Allmusic described Danzig as &quot;one of the very best singers to emerge from hardcore punk, though in a genre where an angry, sneering bark was the order of the day, that only says so much. Still, the guy could carry a tune far better than his peers&quot;. As a musician, in addition to his vocals, Glenn Danzig has also contributed guitar, bass, drums and piano to his various musical projects.

The Misfits combined Danzig&#x27;s harmonic vocals with camp-horror imagery and lyrics. The Misfits sound was a faster, heavier derivation of Ramones-style punk with rockabilly influences. Glenn Danzig&#x27;s Misfits songs dealt almost exclusively with themes derived from B-grade horror and science fiction movies (e.g., &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;) as well as comic books (e.g. &quot;Wasp Women&quot;, &quot;I Turned into a Martian&quot;). Unlike the later incarnation of the Misfits, Danzig also dealt with Atomic Era scandals in songs like &quot;Bullet&quot; (about the assassination of John F. Kennedy), &quot;Who Killed Marilyn&quot; (which alluded to alternate theories about Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s death), and &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; (inspired by the Kenneth Anger book on scandals associated with the early, formative years of Hollywood). In later years the Misfits style was noticeably heavier and faster than during their earlier releases, introducing elements of hardcore punk.

Samhain&#x27;s musical and lyrical style was much darker in tone than Misfits material, fusing an experimental combination of horror punk, gothic–death rock, and heavy metal. With Samhain, Danzig began to introduce more complicated drum patterns. Samhain songs often combined tribal drum beats and distorted guitars. Samhain&#x27;s lyrical themes were rooted in paganism and the occult, pain and violence, and the horrors of reality.

The band Danzig showed a progression to a slower, heavier, more blues-based and doom-driven heavy metal sound primarily influenced by the early sound of Black Sabbath. Other musical influences include The Doors, and the ballads of Roy Orbison. Danzig opted for a thicker and heavier-sounding guitar tone than with his previous bands, retaining his preference for a single lead guitarist and short guitar solos. After replacing the band&#x27;s original line-up, Danzig began to experiment with a more industrial sound, before merging into gothic metal. Later, Danzig albums have returned to the band&#x27;s original sound.

Glenn Danzig&#x27;s lyrics, which had already evolved from those of the Misfits to the more serious style of Samhain, progressed even further with Danzig to become &quot;frighteningly intense images of doom&quot; which &quot;convey their bleak messages with an eerie grace and intelligence&quot;. His lyrics are typically dark in subject matter, bearing &quot;a heavily romanticized, brooding, gothic sensibility, more quietly sinister and darkly seductive than obviously threatening or satanic&quot;. Lyrical themes include love, sex, evil, death, religion, and occult imagery. Danzig&#x27;s songs about love often deal with the pain of loss and loneliness using gothic romanticism. Sex is another common theme, with songs frequently alluding to various sexual practices and depicting powerful, seductive and sometimes supernatural female figures. Glenn Danzig has tackled Biblical subjects and has offered his criticisms of organised religion. He often promotes rebellion and anti-authoritarianism, whilst embracing independence and the left-hand path. In other lyrics, Danzig deals with the subject of death and questions the concepts of evil and sin.

Glenn Danzig has served as the sole songwriter for every band he has fronted, and described his writing process: &quot;Sometimes I get the guitar lines, sometimes I write on the piano, sometimes I&#x27;ll write the lyrics first and then figure out the chord patterns on guitar, and sometimes I write the drum pattern first. It&#x27;s all different&quot;. Danzig also records basic song ideas when away from his home: &quot;I usually hum it into a microcassette recorder and then I transpose it when I get home and work it out on guitar or piano&quot;.

==Television and film==
Danzig appeared with the Misfits in the 1982 concert film &quot;Walk Among You&quot; that also featured Violent Apathy and the Necros. 

Danzig appeared with the Misfits in their 1982 stand alone concert film &quot;Love Hall&quot;.

Danzig made a cameo appearance as himself in the 1988 film &quot;Tougher Than Leather&quot; starring Run-D.M.C.. 

Danzig had a minor role as fallen angel Samayel in the 1998 film &quot;The Prophecy II&quot; starring Christopher Walken.

He was invited by 20th Century Fox to audition for the role of Wolverine in &quot;X-Men&quot;, as his height and build closely resemble that of the film&#x27;s protagonist, as described in the original comic books. However, he declined due to scheduling conflicts. He later admitted that he was glad to turn the role down as he thought the final product was &quot;terrible&quot; and further insulted Hugh Jackman&#x27;s performance, calling it &quot;gay&quot;.

Danzig guest-appeared as himself in the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; episode &quot;Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future&quot; where he purchased the house of the character Carl.

In February 2016, Danzig appeared in the &quot;Portlandia&quot; episode &quot;Weirdo Beach&quot;.

Danzig appeared as vampire Bad Bathory in the 2021 film &quot;Death Rider in the House of Vampires&quot; starring Danny Trejo.

===Directing===
Danzig plays a personal role in the production of the band&#x27;s music videos, suggesting ideas and sometimes directing them himself. He has worked on a film version of the Verotik comic &quot;Ge Rouge&quot;. The possibility of an animated film version of the &quot;Satanika&quot; comic has also been discussed.

In 2019, Danzig made his feature film directorial debut with &quot;Verotika&quot;, an anthology horror film that premiered at Chicago&#x27;s Cinepocalypse Film Festival that year. The film was directed, written and scored by Danzig.

In September 2019, at the Los Angeles red carpet premiere of the Rob Zombie film &quot;3 from Hell,&quot; Danzig told interviewers that production for a new film would begin in October. He described the project as &quot;a vampire Spaghetti western&quot;, after revealing there would not be any more Misfits tours.

In 2020, Danzig announced his next film was &quot;Death Rider in the House of Vampires,&quot; which blends elements of the Spaghetti western with vampire horror. Danzig stated there would be several prominent actors in the film, including: Devon Sawa, Danny Trejo, Julian Sands, and Kim Director.

In multiple interviews, Danzig cites Italian horror director Mario Bava among his directorial inspirations, along with Sergio Leone and Jean Cocteau.

==Personal life==

In January 1992, Danzig became a student of Jerry Poteet, a martial artist in Jeet Kune Do. Danzig has since earned a teaching degree in the discipline. Danzig has also studied Muay Thai.

Danzig, who is 5 ft 3 in height, also developed an interest in bodybuilding:

: “I&#x27;ve always been attracted to the Nietzschean idea of perfection, and so I began trying to perfect my body. I bought Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MODERN BODYBUILDING and started studying. Lifting weights is just lifting weights, but bodybuilding is about sculpting the body. Nutrition is essential, and though I&#x27;d like to be eating candy and cake, it immediately settles on my hips. Unfortunately, when I&#x27;m on the road I only get to work out a few times weekly, but when I&#x27;m at home with my weights and machines I work out four or five times a week.”
Danzig has several distinctive tattoos, all by tattoo artist Rick Spellman, which incorporate artwork based upon his music. These include a Danzig/Samhain skull symbol designed by Michael Golden, a bat with a Misfits Crimson Ghost skull, a wolf&#x27;s head with the text &quot;Wolfs Blood&quot; (the title of a Misfits song), a skeleton as found on the cover art for the album &quot;November-Coming-Fire&quot;, and a demon woman as found on the cover art for &quot;Unholy Passion&quot;. His lower back features the logo for the &quot;Devilman&quot; manga.

Danzig is a fan of horror movies and Japanese anime/manga, and has expressed his appreciation for the works of filmmaker David Cronenberg and manga artist Go Nagai.

Danzig&#x27;s favorite composers include Richard Wagner, Sergei Prokofiev, Camille Saint-Saëns, Carl Orff, and film score composer Jerry Goldsmith.

Danzig is an avid reader and owns a large book collection on subjects including the occult, religious history and true murder cases. He commented about the book &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot; that &quot;every school kid should have this book&quot;, though he later stated that the comment was satirical. Danzig also has a long-standing interest in New World Order-related conspiracies: &quot;Not only have I always been interested in the families that run the world forever, that people know now as the Bilderberg Group. But there&#x27;s an older book called &quot;Committee of 300&quot; which tells you all about it. I mean, I got in trouble for this back in the 90s, talking about this kind of stuff – how the United States is based on a Freemason thing, and I got so many government files on me from that one&quot;.

Regarding his political views, Danzig has described himself as being &quot;conservative on some issues, and some issues I&#x27;m really liberal&quot;. He defended President Donald Trump&#x27;s controversial travel ban from selected countries, arguing &quot;It&#x27;s really not a travel ban. When you walk into the country, we want to see who you are and what you&#x27;re doing.&quot; Danzig has voiced his dissatisfaction with the United States&#x27; two-party system; stating &quot;the bottom line is that both parties are in agreement about one thing: They don&#x27;t want a third, a fourth, or a fifth party in there. They want it Democratic and Republican. Both sides are corrupt.&quot;

Though sometimes portrayed as a Satanist by the media, Danzig has denied this in several interviews, elaborating that &quot;I embrace both my light and dark side... I definitely believe in a yin and yang, good and evil. My religion is a patchwork of whatever is real to me. If I can draw the strength to get through the day from something, that&#x27;s religion... I&#x27;m not trying to be preachy or tell people what to think.&quot; Danzig has voiced his approval of certain aspects of Satanic ideologies, including the quest for knowledge and individual freedom. He has stated that religion does not play a role in how he perceives other bands and musicians.

<text>Gloria de los Ángeles Treviño Ruiz (born February 15, 1968), known as Gloria Trevi (), is a Mexican singer, songwriter, dancer, actress, television hostess, music video director and businesswoman known as &quot;The Supreme Diva of Mexican Pop&quot;. Since 1998, her name has been linked to the Trevi-Andrade Clan, an organization with cult-like overtones accused of sexual abuse, corruption of minors and labor exploitation, led by Trevi&#x27;s former representative, Sergio Andrade.

== Early life ==
Born in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, Gloria Trevi left Monterrey for Mexico City to pursue her music career. As a child, she developed an interest in American and British rock music artists, such as Led Zeppelin, The Doors, and Janis Joplin.

== Career ==
=== 1985–1995: Early success and initial breakout ===
In 1985, Trevi became a member of a short-lived girl group named Boquitas Pintadas. After the group broke up in 1988, she approached for the production of her first solo album, &quot;¿Qué Hago Aquí?&quot; (&quot;What Am I Doing Here?&quot;), which was released in 1989 and scored a number one hit across Latin America, &quot;Dr. Psiquiatra&quot;. Trevi was often dubbed as the &quot;Madonna of Mexico&quot;.

In 1991, Trevi released her second album, &quot;Tu Ángel de la Guarda&quot; (&quot;Your Guardian Angel&quot;), which is widely regarded as one of her best albums. &quot;Pelo Suelto&quot;, the lead single from the album, was a worldwide success, reaching number 1 in several Latin America countries and in Spain. Billboard magazine included Tu Angel de la Guarda in their list of greatest Latin albums of all time. Her third album, &quot;Me Siento Tan Sola&quot; (&quot;I Feel So Alone&quot;), was released in 1992 garnering another hit, &quot;Zapatos Viejos&quot;. Trevi starred in the film of the same name in 1993. In 1994, she released two singles, &quot;El Recuento De Los Daños&quot; and &quot;La Papa Sin Catsup&quot;, from her fourth studio album &quot;Más Turbada Que Nunca&quot; (&quot;More Turbulent than Ever&quot;). Both singles reigned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums. In December 1995, Trevi released her final studio album of the decade, and her final album produced by Andrade, &quot;Si Me Llevas Contigo&quot; (&quot;If You Take Me with You&quot;). The album produced two moderate hits, &quot;Ella Que Nunca Fue Ella&quot; (&quot;She Who Never Was Herself&quot;) and &quot;Si Me Llevas Contigo&quot; (&quot;If You Take Me with You&quot;). On March 13, 1996, Trevi announced that she would retire to care for Andrade during his cancer battle. She offered her last two concerts at the National Auditorium, March 16 and 17.

=== 2004–2014: Post-arrest career and continued success ===

Following her release from four years in prison in Brazil and Mexico on suspicion of human trafficking, Trevi released her sixth studio album, &quot;Como Nace el Universo&quot; (&quot;How the Universe Is Born&quot;). The album was preceded by the moderate hit &quot;En el Medio de la Tempestad&quot; (&quot;In the Midst of the Storm&quot;). While her sixth record was well-received as her comeback, her seventh studio album &quot;Una Rosa Blu&quot; was a massive critical and commercial success. Released in 2007, the album produced several successful singles included &quot;Psicofonia, Pruebamelo&quot; (&quot;Prove it to Me&quot;), &quot;El Favor de la Soledad&quot; (&quot;The Favor of Solitude&quot;), &quot;Cinco Minutos&quot; (&quot;Five Minutes&quot;), and &quot;Todos Me Miran&quot; (&quot;Everyone Looks at Me&quot;). During award season, Trevi won Female Artist of the Year at the coveted Premio Lo Nuestro and Female Airplay Song of the Year for &quot;Cinco Minutos&quot; at the Billboard Music Awards.

== Child abuse allegations ==
In 2000, Trevi was arrested in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on charges of corrupting minors. Trevi&#x27;s longtime manager, Sergio Andrade Sanchez, was accused of forcing sex on young girls who were among his teenage protégées.

A year later, while in prison, Trevi announced that she was pregnant. The father was Andrade, according to DNA tests by Brazilian authorities; Trevi and her defense claimed that the results of the DNA test had been fabricated. Trevi was cleared of the charges in 2004 due to lack of evidence after spending four years and eight months in prison in Brazil and Mexico. In December 2023, Trevi sued her former manager for sexual abuse.

<doc id="159494" wikidata="Q201735" url="?curid=159494" title="Triangle (musical instrument)">
<text>The triangle is a musical instrument in the percussion family, classified as an idiophone in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system. Triangles are made from a variety of metals including aluminum, beryllium copper, brass, bronze, iron, and steel. The metal is bent into a triangular shape with one open end. The instrument is usually held by a loop of some form of thread or wire at the top curve, to enable the triangle to vibrate and it is struck with a metal rod called a &quot;beater&quot;. The triangle theoretically has indefinite pitch, and produces a plurality of overtones when struck with an appropriate beater.

== History ==

Iconography is the primary source for knowledge of the history of the triangle, and provides insight into the musical and social context in which the instrument developed. Some scholars believe the triangle to be a direct descendant of the ancient Egyptian sistrum. Others do not go quite so far, referring to the triangle as being &quot;allied&quot; with the sistrum throughout history, but not a direct descendant. Like the sistrum, the triangle, as seen in iconography, has its origins in religious settings. The triangle is used as a liturgical instrument in the rites of the Coptic Church based in Egypt and the Syro-Malabar Church based in Kerala, India.

For decades, it was thought that the first iconographic witness of a triangle came from a 9th-century manuscript held at Emmeram of Regensburg, through longstanding writings by James Blades and others, although recent scholarship does not share this view. In the 14th century, early depictions of the triangle emerge from Western Christian iconography. From that time forward, the triangle is seen in iconography through the centuries, in a variety of sizes, and sometimes having jingling rings hanging from its rungs. Triangles are depicted as having an open corner with the ends not touching, and also as having with fully closed corners; the sides are sometimes slightly curved. Triangles are also in shapes that are not quite triangular, such as trapezoids and stirrup shapes. The first known use of the &quot;written&quot; term “triangle” occurs in an inventory list of the musical instruments owned by the kapelle in Wurttemberg, Germany. The list was compiled by Balduin Hoyoul in 1589, over two hundred years after the iconographic emergence of the triangle in the fourteenth century.

Around the eighteenth century, the use of the triangle began to expand; its sound started to bring about new musical connotations and associations. Influenced by ambassadorship, diplomacy, “&quot;Turquerie&quot;” and the new sounds of their own military bands, European operatic and orchestral composers began to incorporate the triangle as a means of &quot;emulating&quot; the sounds of the &quot;mehterân&quot;—the metallic sounds of the &quot;zil&quot; and &quot;cevgen&quot;, combined with the rhythmic pulse of the &quot;kös&quot;, &quot;davul&quot;, and &quot;nakkare&quot;. The early use of the triangle in an operatic/orchestral setting was often not notated, and simply performed by ear. When a triangle part &quot;was&quot; notated, it was in steady, repetitive figures providing a march-like character. The triangle was the &quot;available&quot; instrument in Europe for composers to write rhythmically, and with a metallic color. However, the triangle was &quot;not&quot; used in functional &quot;mehter&quot; music, nor was it used by Janissaries or &quot;mehteran&quot; while providing music for battle. In the early nineteenth century, Romantic-era composers began to seek new colors, and explored the sustaining qualities of the triangle. Preference was given towards a long, sustaining sound that only triangles &quot;without&quot; rings could provide. Thus, the jingling rings associated with the triangle for five centuries prior, fell out of use.

== Shaping and manufacturing ==
The modern triangle is eponymously named after the triangle, though one of the angles is left open with the ends of the bar not quite touching. This opening is used to keep the instrument from having a definite pitch, creating many rich overtones. It is generally suspended from one of the other corners, commonly by a piece of nylon fishing line, leaving it free to vibrate. Early examples of triangles include ornamental work at the open end, often in a scroll pattern. In modern times, the scroll pattern has been abandoned and triangles are made from either steel or brass.

==Technique==

The triangle is often the subject of jokes and one-liners, as an archetypal instrument that seemingly has no musical function and requires no skill to play (the Martin Short character Ed Grimley is an example). However, triangle parts in classical music can be very demanding, and James Blades in the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; writes that &quot;the triangle is by no means a simple instrument to play&quot;.

The triangle is typically suspended from a triangle clip that suspends the triangle so that it is free to vibrate. When the instrument is played with one beater, the hand that holds the triangle clip can also be used to damp or slightly modify the sound. The triangle is usually struck with a metal beater, giving a high-pitched, ringing tone. For complex, rapid rhythms, the instrument may be suspended from a stand using two clips, and played with two beaters, although this makes it more difficult to control. Most difficulties in playing the triangle come from the complex rhythms which are sometimes written for it, and it can also be quite difficult to control the level of volume. Very quiet notes can be obtained by using a much lighter beater; knitting needles are sometimes used as well. Composers sometimes call for wooden beaters to be used instead of a metal one, producing a unique tone. A triangle roll, similar to a snare roll, is notated with three lines through the stem of the note. It requires the player to quickly move the beater back and forth in either the upper or lower corner, moving the beater quickly between the two sides.

== Musical styles ==
===Classical music===

In European classical music, the triangle has been used in the western classical orchestra since around the middle of the 18th century. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven all used it, though sparingly, usually in imitation of Janissary bands. The earliest writing for the triangle is found in Cristoph Willibald Gluck&#x27;s operas Der betrogene Kadi (1761) and &quot;La Cythère Assiégée&quot; (1775)&quot;.&quot; The first piece to use the triangle prominently was Franz Liszt&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 in E♭ major, where it is used as a solo instrument in the third movement, giving this concerto the nickname of &quot;triangle concerto&quot;. In Romantic era music, the triangle was used in some music by Richard Wagner, such as the &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; from &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. Johannes Brahms uses the triangle to a particular effect in the third movement of his Fourth Symphony, the only appearance of non-timpani percussion in a Brahms symphony. Albert Lortzing used triangles in the opening of his opera &quot;Der Waffenschmied&quot; to mimic the sound of hammers in a blacksmith&#x27;s shop.

===Folk and popular music===

In folk music, forró, Cajun music and rock music a triangle is often held directly in the hand so that one side can be damped by the fingers to vary the tone. The sound can also be changed slightly by varying the area struck, and by subtle damping.

The triangle (known in Cajun French as a ‘tit-fer, from &quot;petit fer&quot;, &quot;little iron&quot;) is popular in Cajun music where it serves as the strong beat, especially if no drums are present.

In the Brazilian music style Forró it is used together with the zabumba (a larger drum) and an accordion. It forms together with the zabumba the rhythmic section. It provides usually an ongoing pulse, damping the tone on the first second and fourth while opening the hand on the third beat to let most frequencies sound. It can be used extensively for breaks, to improvise, and to vary the rhythm.

In Indonesian folk music such as Banyuwangi Gandrung music, triangle is used together with gamelan. It is locally called &quot;kluncing&quot; in Osing language.

<doc id="159500" wikidata="Q660064" url="?curid=159500" title="Popular initiative">
<text>A popular initiative (also citizens&#x27; initiative) is a form of direct democracy by which a petition meeting certain hurdles can force a legal procedure on a proposition. 

In direct initiative, the proposition is put directly to a plebiscite or referendum, also called a &quot;popular initiated referendum&quot; or &quot;citizen-initiated referendum&quot;. 

In an indirect initiative, the proposed measure is first referred to the legislature, and then if the proposed law is rejected by the legislature, the government may be forced to put the proposition to a referendum. The proposition may be on federal level law, statute, constitutional amendment, charter amendment, local ordinance, obligate the executive or legislature to consider the subject by submitting it to the order of the day. In contrast, a popular referendum that allows voters only to repeal existing legislation.

The hurdles the petition has to meet vary between countries, typically a certain number of signatures by registered voters, to prevent a flood of frivolous measures on the ballot. It&#x27;s been argued that a signature hurdle does not always determine popular support since the signature hurdle can be achieved through hiring a professional company to gather signatures. Instead of a signature hurdle a state-sponsored public opinion poll as hurdle has been proposed.

The success of a popular initiative depends on the exact wording. 

==By type==
===Direct initiative===
A direct initiative places an initiative measure directly on the ballot for voters to pass or reject. The measure is not submitted to the legislature for support first.

===Indirect initiative===
An indirect initiative is voted on by a legislature after sufficient signatures are collected from the voting population. In most areas the measure is submitted to a subsequent popular vote only if amended by the legislature.

=== Agenda setting initiative ===
An agenda setting initiative is a measure submitted by petition to a legislature for consideration. The legislature may choose to approve or reject the proposal without a public vote. This form or initiative is more common than a legally binding direct or indirect initiative.

==By country==

===Overview===
===Americas===
==== Brazil ====
In Brazil, a popular law initiative requires two conditions be met before it is sent to the National Congress: signatures from at least 1% of national registered voters and at least 0.3% of the people allowed to vote from each of at least five of the 27 federal unities (the 26 states plus the federal district). If both conditions are met, Congress is obliged to discuss and vote on holding the initiative.

==== Canada ====
; British Columbia
The Canadian province of British Columbia has a citizen initiative law known as the Recall and Initiative Act. The original proposal was put to voters in a referendum held in October 1991 and was supported by over 83% of voters. It was subsequently put into force by the incoming NDP government. Since it came into force in 1995, at least 14 attempts have been made to force the government to either adopt a law or to hold a referendum on the question, but only one has succeeded. Only one secured the required signatures of 10% of registered voters in each riding throughout British Columbia. Due to this achievement the government held the first referendum under this legislation, in September 2011 on the subject of repealing the Harmonized Sales Tax. Details of its use in BC are available on the Elections BC website.

==== United States ====

The United States has no initiative process at the national level, but the initiative is in use at the level of state government in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and is also in common use at the local government level.

Article I, Section I of the United States Constitution vests &quot;all legislative powers herein granted&quot; to the Congress of the United States. Establishing a national initiative procedure would likely require an amendment to the Constitution, which would under Article V require two-thirds of both houses of Congress or the application of two-thirds of the state legislatures to propose, and three-fourths of all state legislatures (or conventions in three-fourths of the states) to ratify. The Constitution itself, pursuant to Article VII, was ratified by state conventions rather than by a referendum.

Several proposals have been made to institute a national referendum. The Ludlow Amendment, introduced several times to the House of Representatives by Louis Ludlow of Indiana between 1935 and 1940, proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would require a national referendum to declare war except in the case of invasion or attack. The amendment came closest to overcoming a discharge petition on January 10, 1938, when it was defeated in the House by a vote of 209 to 188, short of the two-thirds vote required for its passage.

Unsuccessful attempts to get initiatives have nevertheless occurred, but since the proposals were bills, not constitutional amendments, no initiative could probably have lawfully been voted on notwithstanding the bills&#x27; passage. The first attempt to get national ballot initiatives occurred in 1907 when House Joint Resolution 44 was introduced by Rep. Elmer Fulton of Oklahoma; the proposal was never put to a vote. In 1977, both the Abourezk-Hatfield National Voter Initiative and the Jagt Resolutions never got out of committee. Senator Mike Gravel was part of that effort.

The modern system of initiatives and referendums in the United States originated in the state of South Dakota, which adopted initiatives and referendums in 1898 by a popular vote of 23,816 to 16,483. Oregon was the second state to adopt and did so in 1902, when the Oregon Legislative Assembly adopted it by an overwhelming majority. The &quot;Oregon System&quot;, as it was at first known, subsequently spread to many other states, and became one of the signature reforms of the Progressive Era (1890s–1920s). Almost every state currently in the union utilizes some sort of State Question or Initiative. A contemporary issue that is commonly decided through this method is the legalization of marijuana.

==== Uruguay ====
In Uruguay, through the &quot;popular initiative&quot;, the electorate can present a bill to the General Assembly, a constitutional reform bill to be submitted to a referendum, and a bill to the departmental governments.

Under Article 79 of the Constitution of the Republic, with the support of 25% of those registered to vote, a bill can be submitted to the General Assembly. For constitutional amendments, Article 331 establishes that with the signature of 10% of citizens registered in the National Civil Registry, a reform bill can be submitted to the president of the General Assembly and submitted to a vote in the following election in a nationwide referendum.

In addition, at the departmental level, under Article 305, 15% of registered residents in a jurisdiction determined by law have the right of initiative before the departmental governing bodies.

===Asia===

==== Philippines ====

People&#x27;s initiative to propose amendments to the constitution is enshrined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution under Article XVII Section 2, which states:

This provision is further protected by Republic Act 6735 or &quot;The Initiative and Referendum Act.&quot; The law defines initiative as:
# A petition to propose amendments to the constitution.
# A petition to propose enactment of national legislation.
# A petition to propose enactment of local resolution or ordinance on regional, provincial, city, municipal, or barangay level.

The law also provides &quot;indirect initiative&quot; defining the exercise of people&#x27;s initiative through a proposition sent to congress or local legislative body for action.

=== Europe ===
==== European Union ====

The rejected Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE) included a limited indirect initiative right (Article I-46(4)). The proposal of introducing the European Citizens&#x27; Initiative (ECI) was that 1,000,000 citizens, from minimal numbers of different member states, could invite the executive body of the European Union (EU), the European Commission, to consider any proposal &quot;on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Constitution.&quot; The precise mechanism had not been agreed upon. Critics underlined the weakness of this right of initiative, which did not ultimately entail any vote or referendum.

A similar scheme under the same name, European Citizens&#x27; Initiative (ECI), has been put forward in the now ratified European Lisbon Treaty (which entered into force on 1 December 2009), enabling a limited indirect initiative right. It follows very similar rules to the ones outlined in the European Constitution, requiring the signatures of 1,000 000 European Nationals. These citizens would thereby obtain the same right to request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal as the Council has had since the establishment of the European Communities in 1957. This, however, does require that the signatures come from a &quot;significant number&quot; of Member States. It is suggested that this significant number will need to be around a quarter of member states, with at least 1/500 of the citizens in those member states supporting the initiative. With the variety of languages within the European Union, this creates a significant hurdle for people to navigate. The treaty also makes it clear that right of initiative should not be confused with the right to petition, particularly since a petition is directed to Parliament while a citizens&#x27; initiative is directed to the Commission; whereas a petition is a method of remonstrance, usually focussing on perceived infringements of European Law, an initiative is a grassroots proposal for new legislation. In 2013 the subjects of ongoing open initiatives of the European Citizens&#x27; Initiative are e.g. about &quot;water and sanitation as a human right&quot; (against Water privatization), &quot;30 km/h - making the streets liveable!&quot; (Traffic calming in towns), &quot;Unconditional Basic Income&quot; (UBI - Exploring a pathway towards emancipatory welfare conditions), or to &quot;End Ecocide in Europe&quot; (to give the Earth Rights).

It remains to be seen if the ECI evolves into a full initiative or remains in its present state of a &quot;de facto&quot; petition.

==== Finland ====
Since 1 March 2012, Finnish citizens with suffrage have had the constitutional right to send a citizens&#x27; initiative (Finnish: &quot;kansalaisaloite&quot;, Swedish: &quot;medborgarinitiativ&quot;) to the Parliament of Finland. An initiative must begin with at least five citizens as sponsors, and it must consist either of a direct proposal for a new law or of a motion to initiate the drafting of a new law by the relevant government department, as well as present reasons for doing so. A single initiative may not contain proposals on more than one specific legislative issue.

Proposed initiatives are published on a website maintained by the Finnish Ministry of Justice, where they may be electronically signed; signatures are also collected on paper. If an initiative is able to attract the signatures of a total of 50,000 citizens within six months, it is forwarded to the Finnish Parliament for consideration; otherwise, it will lapse. The Parliament treats citizens&#x27; initiatives according to normal parliamentary procedure, that is, they are debated and considered in committees and they may also be amended or altered; the Parliament is not restricted to passing or rejecting them as they are.

The first initiative to pass the 50,000 mark did so already a few months after the &quot;kansalaisaloite&quot; first became possible. The initiative demanded the ending of fur industry in Finland, but failed to pass in Parliament. The first initiative to be accepted by the Parliament was the citizens&#x27; initiative known in Finland as &quot;Equal Marriages Law&quot;, which is also known by its campaign slogan, #Tahdon2013 (#IDo2013). This initiative was accepted by the Parliament during the 2011-2015 parliamentary session, though political debate, decision-making and drafting of the new law continued on to the next parliamentary session. The new law took effect on 1 March 2017. To date, a total of 24 citizens&#x27; initiatives have reached the 50,000 mark, with 20 of them having been either rejected or accepted in Parliament - so far, only two have been accepted: the aforementioned &quot;Equal Marriages Law&quot; and the &quot;Motherhood Law&quot; from 2015/16.

==== France ====
A limited, indirect form of local initiative was added to the French Constitution (article 72-1, &quot;référendum d&#x27;initiative locale&quot;) on 28 March 2003 as part of decentralization reforms. However, the only power these &quot;local referendum initiatives&quot; confer on citizens is the ability to add propositions to their local assembly&#x27;s meeting agenda. The decision as to whether to submit citizen propositions to a popular vote (referendum) rests with the local assembly. A citizens&#x27; initiative referendum was proposed by the yellow vests movement. Citizens are able to submit a law project to the parliament through the &quot;Référendum d&#x27;Initiative Partagée&quot;; they can ask for a referendum if they meet the 185 deputies requirement and the signatures of at least 10% of the voting population.

==== Germany ====
All German states have the right to initiative. However, there is no constitutional citizens&#x27; initiative in Germany at a federal level.

====Ireland====
The Constitution of Ireland, since its 1937 enactment, has never made provision for initiatives. Since 2012, the Oireachtas (parliament) has a joint committee to which the public can submit petitions; the committee must formally consider them but need not accept them. In May–June 2013, when the Constitutional Convention considered Dáil electoral reform, members voted 83:16 in favour of allowing &quot;citizens&#x27; initiatives&quot; in general, 80:19 to allow them specifically for legislation, and 78:17 to allow them for constitutional amendments. In April 2015, the Fine Gael–Labour government rejected the recommendations on the basis that there is sufficient public involvement in legislation through the petitions committee and the pre-legislative scrutiny process.

Article 48 of the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State gave a right of initiative: if more than 50,000 voters demanded a change in law, the Oireachtas had two years to enact it, failing which 75,000 voters could petition for a referendum. The only attempt to invoke this was organised in 1927 by Fianna Fáil, the largest opposition party, which sought to abolish the Oath of Allegiance. By May 1928 Fianna Fáil claimed 96,000 signatures and attempted to have the petition laid before the Dáil (lower house). The motion was deferred, ostensibly to allow the Dáil procedure committee to define the method of dealing with such petitions. Before the committee could meet, the Cumann na nGaedheal government rushed through an amendment deleting Article 48 of the Constitution.

====Poland====
Citizens&#x27; legislative initiatives are a constitutional right in Poland, defined in Article 118, paragraph 2, of the 1997 Polish Constitution. The paragraph gives legislative initiative to any group of at least 100,000 citizens with voting rights to the Sejm, the lower house of Polish parliament. The detailed procedure is defined in a law dated 24 June 1999.

Under Article 5 of the 24 June 1999 law, citizens wishing to launch an initiative must create a committee of at least 15 members, which becomes a legal person. The committee must prepare the draft bill and collect at least 100,000 signatures (Article 2). Under Article 12 of the law, if there is &quot;justified doubt regarding the authenticity of the required number of signatures of citizens, then within 14 days of the lodging of the list of signatures, the Marshal of the Sejm must request the National Electoral Commission to verify the signatures. The electoral commission has 21 days to carry out the verification.

One of the best known citizens&#x27; initiatives in Poland is the pair of 2015/2016 anti-abortion and pro-abortion initiatives which were accompanied by the &quot;Black Protest&quot; marches coordinated by women&#x27;s rights groups.

In October 2022, United Poland submitted a citizens&#x27; legislative initiative for tougher blasphemy laws in Poland with close to 400,000 (Higher than the 100,000 needed) signatures to parliament.

====Romania====
According to Article 74 of the Romanian Constitution, groups of at least 100,000 Romanian Citizens with suffrage that reside in at least one quarter of all the counties and with a minimum 5,000 signatures per county have the right to send a Citizens&#x27; Initiative which must be considered by the legislative body (Initiatives that address fiscal or international matters are not covered by this right). If the initiative concerns changing the Constitution, Article 150 of the Constitution states that the group must include at least 500,000 Romanian Citizens with suffrage who reside in at least half of all the counties, with a minimum of 20,000 per county. Article 151 of the Constitution also states that any amendments brought to it, must be also approved by means of a National Referendum.

==== Switzerland ====

The federal popular initiative was included in the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1891, permitting a certain number of citizens (currently 100,000 signatures within 18 months) to make a request to amend a constitutional article, or even to introduce a new article into the constitution. The right of initiative is also used at the cantonal and communal level in Switzerland (all cantons, all communes where the direct democratic citizens&#x27; participation originates); many cantons allow initiatives to enact regular non-constitutional law, but the federal system does not.

If the necessary number of supporters is reached, the initiative will be put to a plebiscite about two or three years later; the delay helps prevent short-term political moods from getting into the constitution. The parliament and government will both issue their official opinions on whether they recommend voting for or against the proposed amendment, and these opinions will be published.

The parliament may also pass an alternative amendment suggestion which will also be included on the ballot; in this case, the voters cast two votes, one for whether or not they want an amendment, and one for which one they want, the original one from the initiative or the one introduced in parliament, in case a majority decides for amending.

A citizen-proposed change to the constitution in Switzerland at the national level needs to achieve both a majority of the national popular vote and a majority of the canton-wide vote to pass. The vast majority of national initiatives introduced since 1891, when the system started, have failed to receive voter support. But the initiatives have proven to be a useful tool to force the government to concentrate on subjects that will otherwise remain hidden from the politic, lowering the distance between the government and the citizens.

==== United Kingdom ====
While there is no mandate for a referendum following directly from such an initiative, the UK government has a system whereby citizens can set up online petitions, which are considered by a committee. Any petition which reaches 10,000 signatures triggers a response from the government and those which reach 100,000 signatures will almost always require the government to consider holding a debate (with some exceptions, such as whether a similar issue has been debated recently, or a debate for that issue is scheduled) on the matter in the House of Commons. Only British Citizens or individuals resident in the UK are allowed to start a petition or be a signatory. Petitions can be initiated via a specialist website, which also contains guidance on when petitions will, and will not, be debated. On occasion, some petitions which are signed by fewer than 100,000 people are still debated. Examples of issues which have been debated in parliament via this system are various issues surrounding Brexit and a petition calling for United States President Donald Trump&#x27;s state visit to UK to be cancelled.

===Oceania===
====New Zealand====
In New Zealand a vote initiated by the public is called a citizen initiated referendum. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months.

<doc id="159501" wikidata="Q570496" url="?curid=159501" title="Alpha–beta pruning">
<text>Alpha–beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player combinatorial games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Connect 4, etc.). It stops evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.

== History ==
John McCarthy during the Dartmouth Workshop met Alex Bernstein of IBM, who was writing a chess program. McCarthy invented alpha–beta search and recommended it to him, but Bernstein was &quot;unconvinced&quot;.

Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon who used what John McCarthy calls an &quot;approximation&quot; in 1958 wrote that alpha–beta &quot;appears to have been reinvented a number of times&quot;. Arthur Samuel had an early version for a checkers simulation. Richards, Timothy Hart, Michael Levin and/or Daniel Edwards also invented alpha–beta independently in the United States. McCarthy proposed similar ideas during the Dartmouth workshop in 1956 and suggested it to a group of his students including Alan Kotok at MIT in 1961. Alexander Brudno independently conceived the alpha–beta algorithm, publishing his results in 1963. Donald Knuth and Ronald W. Moore refined the algorithm in 1975. Judea Pearl proved its optimality in terms of the expected running time for trees with randomly assigned leaf values in two papers. The optimality of the randomized version of alpha–beta was shown by Michael Saks and Avi Wigderson in 1986.

== Core idea ==
A game tree can represent many two-player zero-sum games, such as chess, checkers, and reversi. Each node in the tree represents a possible situation in the game. Each terminal node (outcome) of a branch is assigned a numeric score that determines the value of the outcome to the player with the next move.

The algorithm maintains two values, alpha and beta, which respectively represent the minimum score that the maximizing player is assured of and the maximum score that the minimizing player is assured of. Initially, alpha is negative infinity and beta is positive infinity, i.e. both players start with their worst possible score. Whenever the maximum score that the minimizing player (i.e. the &quot;beta&quot; player) is assured of becomes less than the minimum score that the maximizing player (i.e., the &quot;alpha&quot; player) is assured of (i.e. beta &lt; alpha), the maximizing player need not consider further descendants of this node, as they will never be reached in the actual play.

To illustrate this with a real-life example, suppose somebody is playing chess, and it is their turn. Move &quot;A&quot; will improve the player&#x27;s position. The player continues to look for moves to make sure a better one hasn&#x27;t been missed. Move &quot;B&quot; is also a good move, but the player then realizes that it will allow the opponent to force checkmate in two moves. Thus, other outcomes from playing move B no longer need to be considered since the opponent can force a win. The maximum score that the opponent could force after move &quot;B&quot; is negative infinity: a loss for the player. This is less than the minimum position that was previously found; move &quot;A&quot; does not result in a forced loss in two moves.

== Improvements over naive minimax ==

The benefit of alpha–beta pruning lies in the fact that branches of the search tree can be eliminated. This way, the search time can be limited to the &#x27;more promising&#x27; subtree, and a deeper search can be performed in the same time. Like its predecessor, it belongs to the branch and bound class of algorithms. The optimization reduces the effective depth to slightly more than half that of simple minimax if the nodes are evaluated in an optimal or near optimal order (best choice for side on move ordered first at each node).

With an (average or constant) branching factor of &quot;b&quot;, and a search depth of &quot;d&quot; plies, the maximum number of leaf node positions evaluated (when the move ordering is ) is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;d&quot;) – the same as a simple minimax search. If the move ordering for the search is optimal (meaning the best moves are always searched first), the number of leaf node positions evaluated is about &quot;O&quot;(&quot;b&quot;×1×&quot;b&quot;×1×...×&quot;b&quot;) for odd depth and &quot;O&quot;(&quot;b&quot;×1×&quot;b&quot;×1×...×1) for even depth, or formula_1. In the latter case, where the ply of a search is even, the effective branching factor is reduced to its square root, or, equivalently, the search can go twice as deep with the same amount of computation. The explanation of &quot;b&quot;×1×&quot;b&quot;×1×... is that all the first player&#x27;s moves must be studied to find the best one, but for each, only the second player&#x27;s best move is needed to refute all but the first (and best) first player move—alpha–beta ensures no other second player moves need be considered. When nodes are considered in a random order (i.e., the algorithm randomizes), asymptotically,
the expected number of nodes evaluated in uniform trees with binary leaf-values is formula_2
For the same trees, when the values are assigned to the leaf values independently of each other and say zero and one are both equally probable, the expected number of nodes evaluated is formula_3, which is much smaller than the work done by the randomized algorithm, mentioned above, and is again optimal for such random trees. When the leaf values are chosen independently of each other but from the formula_4 interval uniformly at random, the expected number of nodes evaluated increases to formula_5 in the formula_6 limit, which is again optimal for this kind of random tree. Note that the actual work for &quot;small&quot; values of formula_7 is better approximated using formula_8.

A chess program that searches four plies with an average of 36 branches per node evaluates more than one million terminal nodes. An optimal alpha-beta prune would eliminate all but about 2,000 terminal nodes, a reduction of 99.8%.
Normally during alpha–beta, the subtrees are temporarily dominated by either a first player advantage (when many first player moves are good, and at each search depth the first move checked by the first player is adequate, but all second player responses are required to try to find a refutation), or vice versa. This advantage can switch sides many times during the search if the move ordering is incorrect, each time leading to inefficiency. As the number of positions searched decreases exponentially each move nearer the current position, it is worth spending considerable effort on sorting early moves. An improved sort at any depth will exponentially reduce the total number of positions searched, but sorting all positions at depths near the root node is relatively cheap as there are so few of them. In practice, the move ordering is often determined by the results of earlier, smaller searches, such as through iterative deepening.

Additionally, this algorithm can be trivially modified to return an entire principal variation in addition to the score. Some more aggressive algorithms such as MTD(f) do not easily permit such a modification.

== Pseudocode ==
The pseudo-code for depth limited minimax with alpha–beta pruning is as follows:

Implementations of alpha–beta pruning can often be delineated by whether they are &quot;fail-soft,&quot; or &quot;fail-hard&quot;. With fail-soft alpha–beta, the alphabeta function may return values (v) that exceed (v &lt; α or v &gt; β) the α and β bounds set by its function call arguments. In comparison, fail-hard alpha–beta limits its function return value into the inclusive range of α and β. The main difference between fail-soft and fail-hard implementations is whether α and β are updated before or after the cutoff check. If they are updated before the check, then they can exceed initial bounds and the algorithm is fail-soft.

The following pseudo-code illustrates the fail-hard variation.

 function alphabeta(node, depth, α, β, maximizingPlayer) is
 if depth == 0 or node is terminal then
 return the heuristic value of node
 if maximizingPlayer then
 value := −∞
 for each child of node do
 value := max(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, FALSE))
 if value &gt; β then
 break &quot;(* β cutoff *)&quot;
 α := max(α, value)
 return value
 else
 value := +∞
 for each child of node do
 value := min(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, TRUE))
 if value &lt; α then
 break &quot;(* α cutoff *)&quot;
 β := min(β, value)
 return value

 &quot;(* Initial call *)&quot;
 alphabeta(origin, depth, −∞, +∞, TRUE)

The following pseudocode illustrates fail-soft alpha-beta.

 function alphabeta(node, depth, α, β, maximizingPlayer) is
 if depth == 0 or node is terminal then
 return the heuristic value of node
 if maximizingPlayer then
 value := −∞
 for each child of node do
 value := max(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, FALSE))
 α := max(α, value)
 if value ≥ β then
 break &quot;(* β cutoff *)&quot;
 return value
 else
 value := +∞
 for each child of node do
 value := min(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, TRUE))
 β := min(β, value)
 if value ≤ α then
 break &quot;(* α cutoff *)&quot;
 return value

 &quot;(* Initial call *)&quot;
 alphabeta(origin, depth, −∞, +∞, TRUE)

== Heuristic improvements ==
Further improvement can be achieved without sacrificing accuracy by using ordering heuristics to search earlier parts of the tree that are likely to force alpha–beta cutoffs. For example, in chess, moves that capture pieces may be examined before moves that do not, and moves that have scored highly in earlier passes through the game-tree analysis may be evaluated before others. Another common, and very cheap, heuristic is the killer heuristic, where the last move that caused a beta-cutoff at the same tree level in the tree search is always examined first. This idea can also be generalized into a set of refutation tables.

Alpha–beta search can be made even faster by considering only a narrow search window (generally determined by guesswork based on experience). This is known as an &quot;aspiration window&quot;. In the extreme case, the search is performed with alpha and beta equal; a technique known as &quot;zero-window search&quot;, &quot;null-window search&quot;, or &quot;scout search&quot;. This is particularly useful for win/loss searches near the end of a game where the extra depth gained from the narrow window and a simple win/loss evaluation function may lead to a conclusive result. If an aspiration search fails, it is straightforward to detect whether it failed &quot;high&quot; (high edge of window was too low) or &quot;low&quot; (lower edge of window was too high). This gives information about what window values might be useful in a re-search of the position.

Over time, other improvements have been suggested, and indeed the Falphabeta (fail-soft alpha–beta) idea of John Fishburn is nearly universal and is already incorporated above in a slightly modified form. Fishburn also suggested a combination of the killer heuristic and zero-window search under the name Lalphabeta (&quot;last move with minimal window alpha–beta search&quot;).

== Other algorithms ==
Since the minimax algorithm and its variants are inherently depth-first, a strategy such as iterative deepening is usually used in conjunction with alpha–beta so that a reasonably good move can be returned even if the algorithm is interrupted before it has finished execution. Another advantage of using iterative deepening is that searches at shallower depths give move-ordering hints, as well as shallow alpha and beta estimates, that both can help produce cutoffs for higher depth searches much earlier than would otherwise be possible.

Algorithms like SSS*, on the other hand, use the best-first strategy. This can potentially make them more time-efficient, but typically at a heavy cost in space-efficiency.

<text>Additive color or additive mixing is a property of a color model that predicts the appearance of colors made by coincident component lights, i.e. the perceived color can be predicted by summing the numeric representations of the component colors. Modern formulations of Grassmann&#x27;s laws describe the additivity in the color perception of light mixtures in terms of algebraic equations. Additive color predicts perception and not any sort of change in the photons of light themselves. These predictions are only applicable in the limited scope of color matching experiments where viewers match small patches of uniform color isolated against a gray or black background.

Additive color models are applied in the design and testing of electronic displays that are used to render realistic images containing diverse sets of color using phosphors that emit light of a limited set of primary colors. Examination with a sufficiently powerful magnifying lens will reveal that each pixel in CRT, LCD, and most other types of color video displays is composed of red, green, and blue light-emitting phosphors which appear as a variety of single colors when viewed from a normal distance.

Additive color, alone, does not predict the appearance of mixtures of printed color inks, dye layers in color photographs on film, or paint mixtures. Instead, subtractive color is used to model the appearance of pigments or dyes, such as those in paints and inks.

The combination of two of the common three additive primary colors in equal proportions produces an additive secondary color—cyan, magenta or yellow. Additive color is also used to predict colors from overlapping projected colored lights often used in theatrical lighting for plays, concerts, circus shows, and night clubs.

The full gamut of color available in any additive color system is defined by all the possible combinations of all the possible luminosities of each primary color in that system. In chromaticity space, a gamut is a plane convex polygon with corners at the primaries. For three primaries, it is a triangle.

==History ==

Systems of additive color are motivated by the Young–Helmholtz theory of trichromatic color vision, which was articulated around 1850 by Hermann von Helmholtz, based on earlier work by Thomas Young. For his experimental work on the subject, James Clerk Maxwell is sometimes credited as being the father of additive color. He had the photographer Thomas Sutton photograph a tartan ribbon on black-and-white film three times, first with a red, then green, then blue color filter over the lens. The three black-and-white images were developed and then projected onto a screen with three different projectors, each equipped with the corresponding red, green, or blue color filter used to take its image. When brought into alignment, the three images (a black-and-red image, a black-and-green image and a black-and-blue image) formed a full-color image, thus demonstrating the principles of additive color.

<text>RGB color spaces are a category of additive colorimetric color spaces specifying part of its absolute color space definition using the RGB color model.

RGB color spaces are commonly found describing the mapping of the RGB color model to human perceivable color, but some RGB color spaces use imaginary (non-real-world) primaries and thus can not be displayed directly.

Like any color space, while the specifications in this category use the RGB color model to describe their space, it is not mandatory to use that model to signal pixel color values. Broadcast TV color spaces like NTSC, PAL, Rec. 709, Rec. 2020 additionally describe a translation from RGB to YCbCr and that is how they are usually signalled for transmission, but an image can be stored as either RGB or YCbCr. This demonstrates using the singular term &quot;RGB color space&quot; can be misleading, since a chosen color space or signalled colour can be described by any appropriate color model. However the singular can be seen in specifications where storage signalled as RGB is its intended use.

==Definition==

The normal human eye contains three types of color-sensitive cone cells. Each cell is responsive to light of either long, medium, or short wavelengths, which we generally categorize as red, green, and blue. Taken together, the responses of these cone cells are called the Tristimulus values, and the combination of their responses is processed into the psychological effect of color vision.

RGB use in color space definitions employ primaries (and often a white point) based on the RGB color model, to map to real world color. Applying Grassmann&#x27;s law of light additivity, the range of colors that can be produced are those enclosed within the triangle on the chromaticity diagram defined using the primaries as vertices.

The primary colors are usually mapped to xyY chromaticity coordinates, though the uʹ,vʹ coordinates from the UCS chromaticity diagram may be used. Both xyY and uʹ,vʹ are derived from the CIE 1931 color space, a device independent space also known as XYZ which covers the full gamut of human-perceptible colors visible to the CIE 2° standard observer.

==Applications==

RGB color spaces are well-suited to describing the electronic display of color, such as computer monitors and color television. These devices often reproduce colours using an array of red, green, and blue phosphors agitated by a cathode-ray tube (CRT), or an array of red, green, and blue LCDs lit by a backlight, and are therefore naturally described by an additive color model with RGB primaries.

Early examples of RGB color spaces came with the adoption of the NTSC color television standard in 1953 across North America, followed by PAL and SECAM covering the rest of the world. These early RGB spaces were defined in part by the phosphor used by CRTs in use at the time, and the gamma of the electron beam. While these color spaces reproduced the intended colors using additive red, green, and blue primaries, the broadcast signal itself was encoded from RGB components to a composite signal such as YIQ, and decoded back by the receiver into RGB signals for display.

HDTV uses the BT.709 color space, later repurposed for computer monitors as sRGB. Both use the same color primaries and white point, but different transfer functions, as HDTV is intended for a dark living room while sRGB is intended for a brighter office environment. The gamut of these spaces is limited, covering only 35.9% of the CIE 1931 gamut. While this allows the use of a limited bit depth without causing color banding, and therefore reduces transmission bandwidth, it also prevents the encoding of deeply saturated colors that might be available in an alternate color spaces. Some RGB color spaces such as Adobe RGB and ProPhoto intended for the creation, rather than transmission, of images are designed with expanded gamuts to address this issue, however this does not mean the larger space has &#x27;more colors&quot;. The numerical quantity of colors is related to bit depth and not the size or shape of the gamut. A large space with a low bit depth can be detrimental to the gamut density and result in high formula_1 errors.

More recent color spaces such as Rec. 2020 for UHD-TVs define an extremely large gamut covering 63.3% of the CIE 1931 space. This standard is not currently realisable with current LCD technology, and alternative architectures such as quantum dot or OLED based devices are currently in development.

== Color space specifications employing the RGB color model ==

The CIE 1931 color space standard defines both the CIE RGB space, which is a color space with monochromatic primaries, and the CIE XYZ color space, which is functionally similar to a linear RGB color space, however the primaries are not physically realizable, thus are not described as red, green, and blue.

M.A.C. is not to be confused with MacOS. Here, M.A.C.refers to Multiplexed Analogue Components.

<text>Phoebe Belle Cates Kline (born July 16, 1963) is an American retired actress who appeared in the films &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984), &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; (1990), &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot; (1991) and &quot;Princess Caraboo&quot; (1994).

== Early life ==
Cates was born on July 16, 1963, in New York City, to a family of television and Broadway production insiders. She is the daughter of Lily and Joseph Cates (originally Joseph Katz), who was a major Broadway producer and a pioneering figure in television, and who helped create &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;. Her uncle, Gilbert Cates, produced numerous television specials, often in partnership with Cates&#x27;s father, as well as several annual Academy Awards shows. Her father was Jewish and her mother was Catholic. Cates is of Eurasian or mixed European and Asian descent. Her mother was born in Shanghai, China to a family of Chinese-Filipino heritage. Cates&#x27;s father is American and from Manhattan. 

Cates attended the Professional Children&#x27;s School and the Juilliard School. At age ten, she started modeling, appearing in &quot;Seventeen&quot; and other teen-oriented magazines. A few years later, she wanted to become a dancer, and eventually received a scholarship to the School of American Ballet, but quit after a knee injury at age 14. She then began a short, successful career as a model. She said that she disliked the industry: &quot;It was just the same thing, over and over. After a while, I did it solely for the money.&quot;

== Career ==
As a teen model, Cates appeared on the cover of &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine four times, first in the April 1979 issue. She appeared within the magazine as well, on the editorial pages in 1979 and 1980.

Dissatisfied with modeling, Cates decided to pursue acting. She was offered her first part in the movie &quot;Paradise&quot; (1982) after a screen test in New York. She was uncertain about the nudity the role required, but her father encouraged her to take the job.

&quot;Paradise&quot; was filmed in Israel from March to May 1981. In the film, Cates performed several full-frontal nude scenes and several rear scenes aged 17. The movie had a plot similar to &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;. She also sang the film&#x27;s theme song and recorded an album of the same name. In a 1982 interview, she recalled having trouble with the career change: As a model, she had to be conscious of the camera; but as an actor, she could not. She later regretted being in the film: &quot;What I learned was never to do a movie like that again.&quot; She claimed that the film&#x27;s producers used a body double to film nude close-ups of her character without telling her. According to her co-star Willie Aames, &quot;She will have nothing to do with the film. She&#x27;s really upset about it. She won&#x27;t do any promotion with me.&quot;

Later that year, Cates starred in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), featuring what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has described as &quot;the most memorable bikini-drop in cinema history&quot;. She said that she had &quot;the most fun&quot; filming that movie.

The next year, Cates was in the comedy &quot;Private School&quot; (1983), co-starring Matthew Modine and Betsy Russell, and where she sang on two songs of the film&#x27;s soundtrack: &quot;Just One Touch&quot; and &quot;How Do I Let You Know&quot;.

In 1984, Cates starred in the TV mini-series &quot;Lace&quot;, based on a novel by Shirley Conran. She played the role of Lili &quot;to get away from a sameness in her movie portrayals&quot;. During her audition, she so impressed the writer that he wanted to hire her on the spot. She struggled with the portrayal of a bitter movie star because, despite her character&#x27;s vicious persona, she wanted the audience to sympathize with her. She did not read Conran&#x27;s novel, on which the movie was based because she did not want to have a &quot;fixed image&quot;. Her best-known line in the film, &quot;Which one of you bitches is my mother?&quot;, was named the greatest line in television history by &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 1993. She also starred in the sequel mini-series &quot;Lace II&quot;.

In the summer of 1984, Cates co-starred in the box office hit &quot;Gremlins&quot; for executive producer Steven Spielberg, the highest-grossing film of her career. She reprised her role of Kate Beringer in the sequel &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot;.

In June 1984, Cates made her stage debut in the Off-Broadway play &quot;The Nest of the Wood Grouse&quot;, a comedy by Soviet writer Viktor Rozov, at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. Cates said that while doing the play she &quot;felt a certain freedom and a certain connection with acting that I had never really felt before&quot;. Cates appeared Off-Broadway again two years later in &quot;Rich Relations&quot;, written by David Henry Hwang, at the Second Stage Theatre. In December 1989, Cates made her Broadway debut in a revival of Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;The Tenth Man&quot; at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.

In 1988, Cates told an interviewer, &quot;There are simply not that many good parts in film&quot;, but that theater had &quot;tons of good women&#x27;s roles...I think of theater as what I like to do most...I&#x27;ve only felt happy as an actress for about two years. I rarely watch my film work.&quot;

Cates continued to appear steadily in films through the early 1990s, usually in supporting roles or in ensemble casts. These include &quot;Date with an Angel&quot; (1987), &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; (1988), &quot;Shag&quot; (1988), &quot;Heart of Dixie&quot; (1989), &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot; (1991) and &quot;Bodies, Rest &amp; Motion&quot; (1993). The films suffered from mixed to poor reviews and failed to make an impact at the box office.

Cates was set to play Steve Martin&#x27;s daughter in the successful comedy &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1991), but her pregnancy with her first child forced her to drop out.

In 1994, Cates starred in the fact-based comedy-drama &quot;Princess Caraboo&quot; (1994) with her husband Kevin Kline. It was Cates&#x27;s last film before she shifted her focus away from acting to raising her children, Owen and Greta.

In 2001, Cates briefly returned to acting for one film, &quot;The Anniversary Party&quot; (2001), as a favor to her best friend and former &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; castmate Jennifer Jason Leigh, who directed it.

In 2015, Cates provided the voice of her &quot;Gremlins&quot; character Kate Beringer for the video game &quot;Lego Dimensions.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In the early 1980s, Cates shared an apartment in Greenwich Village with her then-boyfriend Stavros Merjos. She met him in 1979 after she went to her first night at Studio 54 with family friend Andy Warhol.

In 1983, during her audition for a role (awarded to Meg Tilly) in &quot;The Big Chill&quot;, Cates met actor Kevin Kline. They were both dating other people but became romantically involved two years later. They married in a private New York wedding on March 5, 1989, and she changed her name to Phoebe Cates Kline. They moved to the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York, across Fifth Avenue from Central Park, where they raised their two children, son Owen Joseph Kline (b. 1991) and daughter Greta Kline (b. 1994). Owen and Greta appeared with their parents in the 2001 movie &quot;The Anniversary Party.&quot; Owen also appeared in the 2005 film &quot;The Squid and the Whale,&quot; and made his directorial debut with the coming-of-age black comedy &quot;Funny Pages&quot;. Greta fronts the band Frankie Cosmos.

In 2005, Cates opened a boutique, Blue Tree, on New York&#x27;s Madison Avenue.

<doc id="159512" wikidata="Q220457" url="?curid=159512" title="Barnacle">
<text>Barnacles are arthropods of the subclass Cirripedia in the subphylum Crustacea. They are related to crabs and lobsters, with similar nauplius larvae. Barnacles are exclusively marine invertebrates; many species live in shallow and tidal waters. Some 2,100 species have been described.

Barnacle adults are sessile; most are suspension feeders with hard calcareous shells, but the Rhizocephala are specialized parasites of other crustaceans, with reduced bodies. Barnacles have existed since at least the mid-Carboniferous, some 325 million years ago.

In folklore, barnacle geese were once held to emerge fully formed from goose barnacles. Both goose barnacles and the Chilean giant barnacle are fished and eaten. Barnacles are economically significant as biofouling on ships, where they cause hydrodynamic drag, reducing efficiency.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;barnacle&quot; is attested in the early 13th century as Middle English &quot;bernekke&quot; or &quot;bernake&quot;, close to Old French &quot;bernaque&quot; and medieval Latin &quot;bernacae&quot; or &quot;berneka&quot;, denoting the barnacle goose. Because the full life cycles of both barnacles and geese were unknown at the time, (geese spend their breeding seasons in the Arctic) a folktale emerged that geese hatched from barnacles. It was not applied strictly to the arthropod until the 1580s. The ultimate meaning of the word is unknown.

The name comes from the Latin words &quot;cirritus&quot; &quot;curly&quot; from &quot;cirrus&quot; &quot;curl&quot; and &quot;pedis&quot; from &quot;pes&quot; &quot;foot&quot;. The two words together mean &quot;curly-footed&quot;, alluding to the curved legs used in filter-feeding.

== Description ==

Most barnacles are encrusters, attaching themselves to a hard substrate such as a rock, the shell of a mollusc, or a ship; or to an animal such as a whale (whale barnacles). The most common form, acorn barnacles, are sessile, growing their shells directly onto the substrate, whereas goose barnacles attach themselves by means of a stalk.

=== Anatomy and physiology ===

Barnacles have a carapace made of six hard calcareous plates, with a lid or operculum made of four more plates. Inside the carapace, the animal lies on its stomach, projecting its limbs downwards. Segmentation is usually indistinct; the body is more or less evenly divided between the head and thorax, with little or no abdomen. Adult barnacles have few appendages on their heads, with only a single, vestigial pair of antennae attached to the cement gland. The six pairs of thoracic limbs are called cirri; these are feathery and very long. The cirri extend to filter food, such as plankton, from the water and move it towards the mouth.

Acorn barnacles are attached to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae; in effect, the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead. In some barnacles, the cement glands are fixed to a long, muscular stalk, but in most they are part of a flat membrane or calcified plate. These glands secrete a type of natural quick cement made of complex protein bonds (polyproteins) and other trace components like calcium. This natural cement can withstand a pulling strength of and a sticking strength of .

Barnacles have no true heart, although a sinus close to the esophagus performs a similar function, with blood being pumped through it by a series of muscles. The blood vascular system is minimal. Similarly, they have no gills, absorbing oxygen from the water through the cirri and the surface of the body. The excretory organs of barnacles are maxillary glands.

The main sense of barnacles appears to be touch, with the hairs on the limbs being especially sensitive. The adult has three photoreceptors (ocelli), one median and two lateral. These record the stimulus for the barnacle shadow reflex, where a sudden decrease in light causes cessation of the fishing rhythm and closing of the opercular plates. The photoreceptors are likely only capable of sensing the difference between light and dark. This eye is derived from the primary naupliar eye.

== Life cycle ==

Barnacles pass through two distinct larval stages, the nauplius and the cyprid, before developing into a mature adult.

=== Nauplius larva ===

A fertilised egg hatches into a nauplius: a one-eyed larva comprising a head and a telson with three pairs of limbs, lacking a thorax or abdomen. This undergoes six moults, passing through five instars, before transforming into the cyprid stage. Nauplii are typically initially brooded by the parent, and released after the first moult as larvae that swim freely using setae. All but the first instars are filter feeders.

=== Cypris larva ===

The cypris larva is the second and final larval stage before adulthood. In Rhizocephala and Thoracica an abdomen is absent in this stage, but the y-cyprids (post-naupliar instar) has three distinct abdominal segments. It is not a feeding stage; its role is to find a suitable place to settle, since the adults are sessile. The cyprid stage lasts from days to weeks. It explores potential surfaces with modified antennules; once it has found a suitable spot, it attaches head-first using its antennules and a secreted glycoproteinous cement. Larvae assess surfaces based upon their surface texture, chemistry, relative wettability, color, and the presence or absence and composition of a surface biofilm; swarming species are more likely to attach near other barnacles. As the larva exhausts its energy reserves, it becomes less selective in the sites it selects. It cements itself permanently to the substrate with another proteinaceous compound, and then undergoes metamorphosis into a juvenile barnacle.

=== Adult ===

Typical acorn barnacles develop six hard calcareous plates to surround and protect their bodies. For the rest of their lives, they are cemented to the substrate, using their feathery legs (cirri) to capture plankton. Once metamorphosis is over and they have reached their adult form, barnacles continue to grow by adding new material to their heavily calcified plates. These plates are not moulted; however, like all ecdysozoans, the barnacle moults its cuticle.

=== Sexual reproduction ===

Most barnacles are hermaphroditic, producing both eggs and sperms. A few species have separate sexes, or have both males and hermaphrodites. The ovaries are located in the base or stalk, and may extend into the mantle, while the testes are towards the back of the head, often extending into the thorax. Typically, recently moulted hermaphroditic individuals are receptive as females. Self-fertilization, although theoretically possible, has been experimentally shown to be rare in barnacles.

The sessile lifestyle of acorn barnacles makes sexual reproduction difficult, as they cannot leave their shells to mate. To facilitate genetic transfer between isolated individuals, barnacles have developed extraordinarily long penises⁠. Barnacles possess the largest penis-to-body size ratio of any known animal, up to eight times their body length, though on exposed coasts the penis is shorter and thicker. The mating of acorn barnacles is described as pseudocopulation.

The goose barnacle &quot;Pollicipes polymerus&quot; can alternatively reproduce by spermcasting, in which the male barnacle releases his sperm into the water, to be taken up by females. Isolated individuals always made use of spermcasting and sperm capture, as did a quarter of individuals with a close neighbour. This 2013 discovery overturned the long-held belief that barnacles were limited to pseucocopulation or hermaphroditism.

Rhizocephalan barnacles had been considered hermaphroditic, but their males inject themselves into females&#x27; bodies, degrading to little more than sperm-producing cells.

== Ecology ==

=== Filter feeding ===

Most barnacles are filter feeders. From within their shell, they repeatedly reach into the water column with their cirri. These feathery appendages beat rhythmically to draw plankton and detritus into the shell for consumption.

=== Species-specific zones ===

Although they have been found at water depths to , most barnacles inhabit shallow waters, with 75% of species living in water depths less than , and 25% inhabiting the intertidal zone. Within the intertidal zone, different species of barnacles live in very tightly constrained locations, allowing the exact height of an assemblage above or below sea level to be precisely determined.

Since the intertidal zone periodically desiccates, barnacles are well adapted against water loss. Their calcite shells are impermeable, and they can close their apertures with movable plates when not feeding. Their hard shells are assumed by zoologists to have evolved as an anti-predator adaptation.

One group of stalked barnacles has adapted to a rafting lifestyle, drifting around close to the water&#x27;s surface. They colonize every floating object, such as driftwood, and like some non-stalked barnacles attach themselves to marine animals. The species most specialized for this lifestyle is &quot;Dosima fascicularis&quot;, which secretes a gas-filled cement that makes it float at the surface.

=== Parasitism ===

Other members of the class have an entirely different mode of life. Barnacles of the superorder Rhizocephala, including the genus &quot;Sacculina&quot;, are parasitic castrators of other arthropods, including crabs. The anatomy of these parasitic barnacles is greatly reduced compared to their free-living relatives. They have no carapace or limbs, having only unsegmented sac-like bodies. They feed by extending thread-like rhizomes of living cells into their hosts&#x27; bodies from their points of attachment.
Goose barnacles of the genus &quot;Anelasma&quot; (in the order Pollicipedomorpha) are specialized parasites of certain shark species. Their cirri are no longer used to filter-feed. Instead, these barnacles get their nutrients directly from the host through a root-like body part embedded in the shark&#x27;s flesh.

=== Competitors ===

Barnacles are displaced by limpets and mussels, which compete for space. They employ two strategies to overwhelm their competitors: &quot;swamping&quot;, and fast growth. In the swamping strategy, vast numbers of barnacles settle in the same place at once, covering a large patch of substrate, allowing at least some to survive in the balance of probabilities. Fast growth allows the suspension feeders to access higher levels of the water column than their competitors, and to be large enough to resist displacement; species employing this response, such as the aptly named &quot;Megabalanus&quot;, can reach in length.

Competitors may include other barnacles. Balanoids gained their advantage over the chthalamoids in the Oligocene, when they evolved tubular skeletons, which provide better anchorage to the substrate, and allow them to grow faster, undercutting, crushing, and smothering chthalamoids.

=== Predators and parasites ===

Among the most common predators of barnacles are whelks. They are able to grind through the calcareous exoskeleton and eat the animal inside. Barnacle larvae are consumed by filter-feeding benthic predators including the mussel &quot;Mytilus edulis&quot; and the ascidian &quot;Styela gibbsi&quot;. Another predator is the starfish species &quot;Pisaster ochraceus&quot;. A stalked barnacle in the Iblomorpha, &quot;Chaetolepas calcitergum&quot;, lacks a heavily mineralised shell, but contains a high concentration of toxic bromine; this may serve to deter predators. The turbellarian flatworm &quot;Stylochus&quot;, a serious predator of oyster spat, has been found in barnacles. Parasites of barnacles include many species of Gregarinasina (alveolate protozoa), a few fungi, a few species of trematodes, and a parasitic castrator isopod, &quot;Hemioniscus balani&quot;.

== History of taxonomy ==

Barnacles were classified by Linnaeus and Cuvier as Mollusca, but in 1830 John Vaughan Thompson published observations showing the metamorphosis of the nauplius and cypris larvae into adult barnacles, and noted that these larvae were similar to those of crustaceans. In 1834, Hermann Burmeister reinterpreted these findings, moving barnacles from the Mollusca to Articulata (in modern terms, annelids + arthropods), showing naturalists that detailed study was needed to reevaluate their taxonomy.

Charles Darwin took up this challenge in 1846, and developed his initial interest into a major study published as a series of monographs in 1851 and 1854. He undertook this study at the suggestion of his friend the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, namely to thoroughly understand at least one species before making the generalisations needed for his theory of evolution by natural selection. 
The Royal Society notes that barnacles occupied Darwin, who worked from home, so intensely &quot;that his son assumed all fathers behaved the same way: when visiting a friend he asked, &#x27;Where does your father do his barnacles?&#x27;&quot; Upon the conclusion of his research, Darwin declared &quot;I hate a barnacle as no man ever did before.&quot;

== Evolution ==

=== Fossil record ===

The oldest definitive fossil barnacle is &quot;Praelepas&quot; from the mid-Carboniferous, around 330-320 million years ago. Older claimed barnacles such as &quot;Priscansermarinus&quot; from the Middle Cambrian, some , do not show clear barnacle morphological traits, though &quot;Rhamphoverritor&quot; from the Silurian Coalbrookdale Formation of England may represent a stem-group barnacle. Barnacles first radiated and became diverse during the Late Cretaceous. Barnacles underwent a second, much larger radiation beginning during the Neogene and still continuing.

=== Phylogeny ===

The following cladogram, not fully resolved, shows the phylogenetic relationships of the Cirripedia within Thecostraca as of 2021.

=== Taxonomy ===

Over 2,100 species of Cirripedia have been described. Some authorities regard the Cirripedia as a full class or subclass. In 2001, Martin and Davis placed Cirripedia as an infraclass of Thecostraca, and divided it into six orders:

* Infraclass Cirripedia 
** Superorder Acrothoracica 
*** Order Pygophora 
*** Order Apygophora 
** Superorder Rhizocephala 
*** Order Kentrogonida 
*** Order Akentrogonida 
** Superorder Thoracica 
*** Order Pedunculata 
*** Order Sessilia 

In 2021, Chan et al. elevated Cirripedia to a subclass of the Thecostraca, and the superorders Acrothoracica, Rhizocephala, and Thoracica to infraclass. The updated classification with 11 orders has been accepted in the World Register of Marine Species.

* Subclass Cirripedia 
** Infraclass Acrothoracica 
*** Order Cryptophialida 
*** Order Lithoglyptida 
** Infraclass Rhizocephala 
** Infraclass Thoracica 
*** Superorder Phosphatothoracica 
**** Order Iblomorpha 
**** Order † Eolepadomorpha 
*** Superorder Thoracicalcarea 
**** Order Calanticomorpha 
**** Order Pollicipedomorpha 
**** Order Scalpellomorpha 
**** Order † Archaeolepadomorpha 
**** Order † Brachylepadomorpha 
**** (Unranked) Sessilia
***** Order Balanomorpha 
***** Order Verrucomorpha 

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Biofouling ===

Barnacles are of economic consequence, as they often attach themselves to man-made structures. Particularly in the case of ships, they are classified as fouling organisms. The number and size of barnacles that cover ships can impair their efficiency by causing hydrodynamic drag.

=== As food ===

The flesh of some barnacles is routinely consumed by humans, including Japanese goose barnacles (&quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;Capitulum mitella&quot;), and goose barnacles (&quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;Pollicipes pollicipes&quot;), a delicacy in Spain and Portugal. The Chilean giant barnacle &quot;Austromegabalanus psittacus&quot; is fished, or overfished, in commercial quantities on the Chilean coast, where it is known as the .

=== Technological applications ===

MIT researchers have developed an adhesive inspired by the protein-based bioglue produced by barnacles to firmly attach to rocks. The adhesive can form a tight seal to halt bleeding within about 15 seconds of application.

The stable isotope signals in the layers of barnacle shells can potentially be used as a forensic tracking method for whales, loggerhead turtles and for marine debris, such as shipwrecks or aircraft wreckage.

=== In culture ===

One version of the barnacle goose myth is that the birds emerge fully formed from goose barnacles. The myth, with variants such as that the goose barnacles grow on trees, owes its longstanding popularity to ignorance of bird migration. The myth survived to modern times through bestiaries.

More recently, Barnacle Bill became a &quot;comic folktype&quot; of a seaman, with a drinking song and several films (a 1930 animated short with Betty Boop, a 1935 British drama, a 1941 feature with Wallace Beery, and a 1957 Ealing comedy) named after him.

The political reformer John W. Gardner likened middle managers who settle into a comfortable position and &quot;have stopped learning or growing&quot; to the barnacle, who &quot;is confronted with an existential decision about where it&#x27;s going to live. Once it decides... it spends the rest of its life with its head cemented to a rock&quot;.

<text>An evaluation function, also known as a heuristic evaluation function or static evaluation function, is a function used by game-playing computer programs to estimate the value or goodness of a position (usually at a leaf or terminal node) in a game tree. Most of the time, the value is either a real number or a quantized integer, often in &quot;n&quot;ths of the value of a playing piece such as a stone in go or a pawn in chess, where &quot;n&quot; may be tenths, hundredths or other convenient fraction, but sometimes, the value is an array of three values in the unit interval, representing the win, draw, and loss percentages of the position. 

There do not exist analytical or theoretical models for evaluation functions for unsolved games, nor are such functions entirely ad-hoc. The composition of evaluation functions is determined empirically by inserting a candidate function into an automaton and evaluating its subsequent performance. A significant body of evidence now exists for several games like chess, shogi and go as to the general composition of evaluation functions for them.

Games in which game playing computer programs employ evaluation functions include chess, go, shogi (Japanese chess), othello, hex, backgammon, and checkers. In addition, with the advent of programs such as MuZero, computer programs also use evaluation functions to play video games, such as those from the Atari 2600. Some games like tic-tac-toe are strongly solved, and do not require search or evaluation because a discrete solution tree is available.

==Relation to search==
A tree of such evaluations is usually part of a search algorithm, such as Monte Carlo tree search or a minimax algorithm like alpha–beta search. The value is presumed to represent the relative probability of winning if the game tree were expanded from that node to the end of the game. The function looks only at the current position (i.e. what spaces the pieces are on and their relationship to each other) and does not take into account the history of the position or explore possible moves forward of the node (therefore static). This implies that for dynamic positions where tactical threats exist, the evaluation function will not be an accurate assessment of the position. These positions are termed non-&quot;quiescent&quot;; they require at least a limited kind of search extension called quiescence search to resolve threats before evaluation. Some values returned by evaluation functions are absolute rather than heuristic, if a win, loss or draw occurs at the node.

There is an intricate relationship between search and knowledge in the evaluation function. Deeper search favors less near-term tactical factors and more subtle long-horizon positional motifs in the evaluation. There is also a trade-off between efficacy of encoded knowledge and computational complexity: computing detailed knowledge may take so much time that performance decreases, so approximations to exact knowledge are often better. Because the evaluation function depends on the nominal depth of search as well as the extensions and reductions employed in the search, there is no generic or stand-alone formulation for an evaluation function. An evaluation function which works well in one application will usually need to be substantially re-tuned or re-trained to work effectively in another application.

==In chess==
In computer chess, the output of an evaluation function is typically an integer, and the units of the evaluation function are typically referred to as pawns. The term &#x27;pawn&#x27; refers to the value when the player has one more pawn than the opponent in a position, as explained in Chess piece relative value. The integer 1 usually represents some fraction of a pawn, and commonly used in computer chess are centipawns, which are a hundredth of a pawn. Larger evaluations indicate a material imbalance or positional advantage or that a win of material is usually imminent. Very large evaluations may indicate that checkmate is imminent. An evaluation function also implicitly encodes the value of the right to move, which can vary from a small fraction of a pawn to win or loss. 

===Handcrafted evaluation functions===
Historically in computer chess, the terms of an evaluation function are constructed (i.e. handcrafted) by the engine developer, as opposed to discovered through training neural networks. The general approach for constructing handcrafted evaluation functions is as a linear combination of various weighted terms determined to influence the value of a position. However, not all terms in a handcrafted evaluation function are linear. Some, such as king safety and pawn structure, are nonlinear. Each term may be considered to be composed of first order factors (those that depend only on the space and any piece on it), second order factors (the space in relation to other spaces), and nth-order factors (dependencies on history of the position). 

A handcrafted evaluation function typically has a material balance term that usually dominates the evaluation. The conventional values used for material are Queen=9, Rook=5; Knight or Bishop=3; Pawn=1; the king is assigned an arbitrarily large value, usually larger than the total value of all the other pieces. In addition, it typically has a set of positional terms usually totaling no more than the value of a pawn, though in some positions the positional terms can get much larger, such as when checkmate is imminent. Handcrafted evaluation functions typically contain dozens to hundreds of individual terms. 

In practice, effective handcrafted evaluation functions are not created by expanding the list of evaluated parameters, but by careful tuning or training of the weights relative to each other, of a modest set of parameters such as those described above. Toward this end, positions from various databases are employed, such as from master games, engine games, Lichess games, or even from self-play, as in reinforcement learning. 

====Example====
An example handcrafted evaluation function for chess might look like the following:
* c1 * material + c2 * mobility + c3 * king safety + c4 * center control + c5 * pawn structure + c6 * king tropism + ...

Each of the terms is a weight multiplied by a difference factor: the value of white&#x27;s material or positional terms minus black&#x27;s. 

* The material term is obtained by assigning a value in pawn-units to each of the pieces. 
* Mobility is the number of legal moves available to a player, or alternately the sum of the number of spaces attacked or defended by each piece, including spaces occupied by friendly or opposing pieces. Effective mobility, or the number of &quot;safe&quot; spaces a piece may move to, may also be taken into account. 
* King safety is a set of bonuses and penalties assessed for the location of the king and the configuration of pawns and pieces adjacent to or in front of the king, and opposing pieces bearing on spaces around the king. 
* Center control is derived from how many pawns and pieces occupy or bear on the four center spaces and sometimes the 12 spaces of the extended center. 
* Pawn structure is a set of penalties and bonuses for various strengths and weaknesses in pawn structure, such as penalties for doubled and isolated pawns. 
* King tropism is a bonus for closeness (or penalty for distance) of certain pieces, especially queens and knights, to the opposing king.

===Neural networks===
While neural networks have been used in the evaluation functions of chess engines since the late 1980s, they did not become popular in computer chess until the late 2010s, as the hardware needed to train neural networks was not strong enough at the time, and fast training algorithms and network topology and architectures have not been developed yet. Initially, neural network based evaluation functions generally consisted of one neural network for the entire evaluation function, with input features selected from the board and whose output is an integer, normalized to the centipawn scale so that a value of 100 is roughly equivalent to a material advantage of a pawn. The parameters in neural networks are typically trained using reinforcement learning or supervised learning. More recently, evaluation functions in computer chess have started to use multiple neural networks, with each neural network trained for a specific part of the evaluation, such as pawn structure or endgames. This allows for hybrid approaches where an evaluation function consists of both neural networks and handcrafted terms.

Deep neural networks have been used, albeit infrequently, in computer chess after Matthew Lai&#x27;s Giraffe in 2015 and Deepmind&#x27;s AlphaZero in 2017 demonstrated the feasibility of deep neural networks in evaluation functions. The distributed computing project Leela Chess Zero was started shortly after to attempt to replicate the results of Deepmind&#x27;s AlphaZero paper. Apart from the size of the networks, the neural networks used in AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero also differ from those used in traditional chess engines as they have two outputs, one for evaluation (the value head) and one for move ordering (the policy head), rather than only one output for evaluation. In addition, while it is possible to set the output of the value head of Leela&#x27;s neural network to a real number to approximate the centipawn scale used in traditional chess engines, by default the output is the win-draw-loss percentages, a vector of three values each from the unit interval. Since deep neural networks are very large, engines using deep neural networks in their evaluation function usually require a graphics processing unit in order to efficiently calculate the evaluation function.

===Piece-square tables===
An important technique in evaluation since at least the early 1990s is the use of piece-square tables (also called piece-value tables) for evaluation. Each table is a set of 64 values corresponding to the squares of the chessboard. The most basic implementation of piece-square table consists of separate tables for each type of piece per player, which in chess results in 12 piece-square tables in total. More complex variants of piece-square tables are used in computer chess, one of the most prominent being the king-piece-square table, used in Stockfish, Komodo Dragon, Ethereal, and many other engines, where each table considers the position of every type of piece in relation to the player&#x27;s king, rather than the position of the every type of piece alone. The values in the tables are bonuses/penalties for the location of each piece on each space, and encode a composite of many subtle factors difficult to quantify analytically. In handcrafted evaluation functions, there are sometimes two sets of tables: one for the opening/middlegame, and one for the endgame; positions of the middle game are interpolated between the two.

Originally developed in computer shogi in 2018 by Yu Nasu, the most common evaluation function used in computer chess today is theefficiently updatable neural network, or NNUE for short, a sparse and shallow neural network that has only piece-square tables as the inputs into the neural network. In fact, the most basic NNUE architecture is simply the 12 piece-square tables described above, a neural network with only one layer and no activation functions. An efficiently updatable neural network architecture, using king-piece-square tables as its inputs, was first ported to chess in a Stockfish derivative called Stockfish NNUE, publicly released on May 30, 2020, and was adopted by many other engines before eventually being incorporated into the official Stockfish engine on August 6, 2020.

===Endgame tablebases===
Chess engines frequently use endgame tablebases in their evaluation function, as it allows the engine to play perfectly in the endgame.

==In Go==
Historically, evaluation functions in Computer Go took into account both territory controlled, influence of stones, number of prisoners and life and death of groups on the board. However, modern go playing computer programs largely use deep neural networks in their evaluation functions, such as AlphaGo, Leela Zero, Fine Art, and KataGo, and output a win/draw/loss percentage rather than a value in number of stones.

<doc id="159515" wikidata="Q7705276" url="?curid=159515" title="Tertium quid">
<text>Tertium quid refers to an unidentified third element that is in combination with two known ones. The phrase is associated with alchemy. It is Latin for &quot;third something&quot; (literally, &quot;third what&quot;), a translation of the Greek &quot;triton ti&quot; (τρίτον τί). The Greek phrase was used by Plato (360 BC), and by Irenæus (&quot;c.&quot; AD 196). The earliest Latin example is by Tertullian (&quot;c.&quot; 220), who used the phrase to describe a mixed substance with composite properties such as electrum, a somewhat different sense than the modern meaning.

==In Christology==

In the Christological debates of the fourth century, it was used to refer to the followers of Apollinaris who spoke of Christ as something neither human nor divine, but a mixture of the two in a mysterious and inseparable way, and therefore a &quot;third thing&quot;. This term is used in reference to Miaphysite Christology.

== In American political history ==
In American political history, the Tertium Quids, or Quids, were moderate members of Jefferson&#x27;s Democratic-Republican Party. The word implies that their political position was apt to embrace true republicanism and the comparable conservatism of the Federalist Party, particularly on foreign policy. The Quids arose in 1804 during Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s first term in office. They were led by Virginia&#x27;s John Randolph of Roanoke. They stood by the party&#x27;s original stance for strict construction of the Constitution and opposed Jefferson&#x27;s pragmatic approach to governing.

==In sociology==

In sociology, it describes a category of degraded moral consideration.

In Souls of Black Folk, W.E.B. Du Bois used the term &quot;tertium quid&quot; to refer to the identity of African Americans in a racist society, where non-white people are viewed as a devalued category between man and animal. 
:&quot;The second thought streaming from the death (slave)-ship and the curving river is the thought of the older South, the sincere and passionate belief that somewhere between men and cattle, God created a tertium quid, and called it a Negro—a clownish, simple creature, at times even lovable within its limitations, but straitly foreordained to walk within the Veil.&quot;

==In American law==
The term is used in the Supreme Court of the United States case &quot;Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc.&quot; 529 U.S. 205 (2000). In this Lanham Act case, the Court, when discussing product packaging vs. product design, referred to the type of trade dress in its earlier &quot;Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.&quot; decision as &quot;some tertium quid&quot; that may be a mutation of product packaging and product design—a &quot;third thing.&quot;

==In literature==

In literature, it can describe an adulterer, often in a cuckolded relationship. 

Kipling employs the term in his story &quot;At the Pit’s Mouth&quot; for an adulterer: &quot;Once upon a time there was a Man and his Wife and a Tertium Quid.&quot;

Talbot Mundy, a contemporary of Kipling, makes use of the term in &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot; to describe a cuckold, &quot;&quot;And what kind of man must Rewa Gunga be who could lightly let go all the prejudices of the East and submit to what only the West has endured hitherto with any complacency—a &quot;tertium quid&quot;? &quot;&quot;

Also, Robert Browning uses the term &quot;Tertium Quid&quot; in his long narrative poem &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot; for a section presenting third, more balanced viewpoint on the 1698 Roman murder case his poem discusses, different from the opinions expressed in the sections &quot;Half Rome&quot; and &quot;The Other Half Rome&quot;, which strongly sympathize with, or equally deplore, the accused.

Tertium Quid is also the title of a book of essays on various topics by Edmund Gurney, published in 1887. He has chosen topics which had opposing points of view but for which he proposes a third way of considering them.

<text>The council–manager government is a form of local government commonly used for municipalities and counties in the United States and Ireland, in New Zealand regional councils, and in Canadian municipalities. In the council-manager government, an elected city council hires a manager to serve as chief executive; this manager can be replaced by a simple majority at any time. 
==Overview==
The council-manager system is similar to the typical governance of a publicly traded corporation. Under the form, an elected governing body, usually called a city council, board of aldermen, or similar title, is responsible for legislative functions such as establishing policy, passing local ordinances, voting appropriations, and developing an overall vision, similar to a corporate board of directors. The city council is accountable to the citizens of the community they represent, who play a similar role to that of shareholders in a corporation. The council or commission appoints a city manager to oversee the administrative operations, implement its policies, and advise it. The manager position is similar to that of a corporate chief executive officer appointed by a board of directors. The position of &quot;mayor&quot; present in this type of legislative body is a largely ceremonial title, and may be selected by the council from among its members or elected as an at-large council member with no executive functions, similar to a non-executive chairperson in a corporation.

The International City/County Management Association (ICMA), a professional organization for city managers, has listed at least three defining characteristics that distinguish a true council–manager government:
* All governmental authority rests with the council or other elected body, except for certain executive or administrative duties that are assigned to the manager. However, the manager always is employed at the pleasure of the elected body.
* The manager is allocated their functions in codified form by the city charter or other law, not assigned them &quot;ad hoc&quot; by a mayor.
* The manager must be responsible to, hired by, and can be dismissed only by the entire council, not one individual, such as a mayor or chairperson.

As of 2019, it is used in 52.7% of American cities with populations over 10,000.

==History in the United States==
The concept of the council–manager form of government was a product of a confluence of the prevailing modes of thought during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Probably the foremost influence was the Progressive Movement; following along the thought lines of the movement, the municipal reformers of that time wanted to rid municipalities of the pervasive &quot;political machine&quot; form of government and the abuses of the spoils system. The thought was to have a politically impartial administrator or manager to carry out the administrative function.

Staunton, Virginia, is credited as the first American city to appoint a city manager, which it did in 1908. This appointment attracted attention to the fledgling profession and caught the eye of Richard S. Childs, who would become known as the &quot;father&quot; of the council–manager form of government. The first large city to adopt the council–manager form was Dayton, Ohio, in 1913. Ohio Progressives organizing for the city manager plan also prioritized proportional representation with adoption in Ashtabula, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Hamilton, and Toledo.

The council–manager form of government developed, at least in part, as a response to some perceived limitations of the city commission government form. Since it relies on candidates being elected at-large, minority populations are often unable to elect candidates of their choice. In addition, it may concentrate too much power in individual commissioners, who also manage city departments. The council–manager form became the preferred alternative for progressive reform. After World War I, few cities adopted the commission form and many cities using the commission plan switched to the council–manager form.

By 2001 there were 3,302 cities with a population over 2,500 and 371 counties using the council–manager system. Phoenix, Arizona, is the largest city in the United States to retain a council–manager government.

Since the turn of the 21st century, there have been studies about hybrid forms of local governments that take elements of both council–manager and mayor–council forms. The cities that have modified their organizational structure from one of the pure forms have been called &quot;adaptive&quot; forms.

==History in the Republic of Ireland==

Following the turmoil of World War I (1914–1918), the 1916 rising, the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), and the Irish Civil War (1921–1923), the Irish government found it necessary to remove the members of several local authorities and replace them temporarily by paid commissioners.

Both Dublin and Cork city councils were so removed. In both cities, there was a body of opinion that the services provided by the councils were delivered more efficiently and fairly under the commissioners than under the previous system, where the executive function had been, in effect, vested in the councils and their committees.

In 1926, a committee of commercial and industrial interests in Cork came together to consider a scheme of city government. Having regard to the city&#x27;s experience of commissioners and recent experience in the United States a council–manager plan of city government was proposed.

After discussion between the minister for local government and local representatives, the minister, Richard Mulcahy, introduced as a government measure, the &quot;Cork City Management Bill 1929&quot; and it became law despite opposition. The minister proposed and the Oireachtas enacted similar provision for Dublin City in 1930. Similar laws were passed for Limerick in 1934 and Waterford in 1939 under the Fianna Fáil government.

Under the &quot;County Management Act 1940&quot;, which was brought into operation in August 1942, a &quot;county manager&quot; is the manager of every borough or town in that county, but since the 1990s, has the power to delegate these functions to any other officer of that borough or town council.

The system was modified also in subsequent legislation, particularly the &quot;City and County Management (Amendment) Act 1955&quot;, which made some adjustments to give greater power to the council members, and the &quot;Local Government Act 1985&quot;, which provided for the council–manager system in Galway City once detached for local government purposes from County Galway.

The above acts have been replaced since that time, in substantially the same form, by the &quot;Local Government Act 2001&quot;.

==History in Germany==
The council-manager form of local government was originally introduced into the West German states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia by post-WWII legislation. It was abolished in the mid-1990s when changes to local government law resulted in the adoption of the mayor-council system. The equivalent German term for the position of city manager was &quot;&quot;.

<text>A city manager is an official appointed as the administrative manager of a city in the council–manager form of city government. Local officials serving in this position are referred to as the chief executive officer (CEO) or chief administrative officer (CAO) in some municipalities.

==Responsibilities==
In a technical sense, the term &quot;city manager&quot;, in contrast to &quot;chief administrative officer&quot; (CAO), implies more discretion and independent authority that is set forth in a charter or some other body of codified law, as opposed to duties being assigned on a varying basis by a single superior, such as a mayor.

As the top appointed official in the city, the city manager is typically responsible for most if not all of the day-to-day administrative operations of the municipality, in addition to other expectations.

Some of the basic roles, responsibilities, and powers of a city manager include:
* Supervision of day-to-day operations of all city departments and staff through department heads;
* Oversight of all recruitment, dismissal, disciplining and suspensions;
* Preparation, monitoring, and execution of the city budget, which includes submitting each year to the council a proposed budget package with options and recommendations for its consideration and possible approval;
* Main technical advisor to the council on overall governmental operations;
* Public relations, such as meeting with citizens, citizen groups, businesses, and other stakeholders (the presence of a mayor may alter this function somewhat);
* Operating the city with a professional understanding of how all city functions operate together to their best effect;
*Attends all council meetings, but does not have any voting rights
*Additional duties that may be assigned by the council

The responsibilities may vary depending upon charter provisions and other local or state laws, rules, and regulations. In addition, many states, such as the states of New Hampshire and Missouri, have codified in law the minimum functions a local &quot;manager&quot; must perform. The City Manager position focuses on efficiency and providing a certain level of service for the lowest possible cost. The competence of a city manager can be assessed using composite indicators.

Manager members of the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) are bound by a rather rigid and strongly enforced code of ethics that was originally established in 1924. Since that time the code had been up-dated/revised on seven occasions, the latest taking place in 1998. The updates have taken into account the evolving duties, responsibilities, and expectations of the profession; however the core dictate of the body of the code--&quot;to integrity; public service; seek no favor; exemplary conduct in both personal and professional matters; respect the role and contributions of elected officials; exercise the independence to do what is right; political neutrality; serve the public equitably and governing body members equally; keep the community informed about local government matters; and support and lead our employ-ees&quot;—have not changed since the first edition.

==History==

Most sources trace the first city manager to Staunton, Virginia in 1908. Some of the other cities that were among the first to employ a manager were Sumter, South Carolina (1912) and Dayton, Ohio (1914); Dayton was featured in the national media, and became a national standard. The first &quot;City Manager&#x27;s Association&quot; meeting of eight city managers was in December 1914. The city manager, operating under the council-manager government form, was created in part to remove city government from the power of the political parties, and place management of the city into the hands of an outside expert who was usually a business manager or engineer, with the expectation that the city manager would remain neutral to city politics. By 1930, two hundred American cities used a city manager form of government.

In 1913, the city of Dayton, Ohio suffered a great flood, and responded with the innovation of a paid, non-political city manager, hired by the commissioners to run the bureaucracy; civil engineers were especially preferred. Other small or middle-sized American cities, especially in the west, adopted the idea.

In Europe, smaller cities in the Netherlands were specially attracted by the plan.

By 1940, there were small American cities with city managers that would grow enormously by the end of the century: Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; Rochester, New York; and San Diego, California.

==Profile==
In the early years of the profession, most managers came from the ranks of the engineering professions. Today, the typical and preferred background and education for the beginning municipal manager is a master&#x27;s degree in Public Administration (MPA), and at least several years&#x27; experience as a department head in local government, or as an assistant city manager. As of 2005, more than 60% of those in the profession had a MPA, MBA, or other related higher-level degree.

The average tenure of a manager is now 7–8 years, and has risen gradually over the years. Tenures tend to be less in smaller communities and higher in larger ones, and they tend to vary as well, depending on the region of the country.

<doc id="159525" wikidata="Q81989" url="?curid=159525" title="Gabriel">
<text>In the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam and the Baháʼí Faith), Gabriel ( ) is an archangel with the power to announce God&#x27;s will to mankind. He is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, the Quran and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Many Christian traditions – including Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Anglicanism – revere Gabriel as a saint.

In the Hebrew Bible, Gabriel appears to the prophet Daniel to explain his visions (Daniel 8:15–26, 9:21–27). The archangel also appears in the Book of Enoch and other ancient Jewish writings not preserved in Hebrew. Alongside the archangel Michael, Gabriel is described as the guardian angel of the people of Israel, defending it against the angels of the other peoples.

In the New Testament, the Gospel of Luke relates the Annunciation, in which the angel Gabriel appears to Zechariah foretelling the birth of John the Baptist with the angel Gabriel foretelling the Virgin Mary the birth of Jesus Christ, respectively (Luke 1:11–38).

Islam regards Gabriel as an archangel sent by God to various prophets, including Muhammad. The first five verses of the &quot;Al-Alaq&quot;, the 96th chapter of the Quran, are believed by Muslims to have been the first verses revealed by Gabriel to Muhammad.

==Etymology==
The name Gabriel (Hebrew: גַּבְרִיאֵל, &quot;Gaḇrīʾēl&quot;) is composed of the first person singular possessive form of the Hebrew noun &quot;gever&quot; (גֶּבֶר), meaning &quot;man&quot;, and &quot;ʾĒl&quot;, meaning &quot;God&quot;. This would make the translation of the archangel&#x27;s name &quot;man of God&quot;.

Proclus of Constantinople, in his famous Homily 1, stated that the meaning of Gabriel&#x27;s name prefigured that Jesus, whose birth was announced by Gabriel, would be both man and God.

== Zoroastrianism ==

After the Jews&#x27; exile to Babylon in the 6th century BCE, Jewish beliefs underwent a significant transformation. Exposure to Zoroastrianism, with its intricate angelology and the concept of a cosmic struggle between good and evil, likely influenced this evolution. The striking similarities between &quot;holy immortal&quot; (Amesha Spentas) Vohu Manah (or &quot;good mind&quot;) and Gabriel&#x27;s role as a messenger suggest a potential connection. This exposure to Zoroastrian angelology during the exile period may have played a part in shaping Gabriel&#x27;s prominent role as a divine messenger in Judaism.

==Judaism==
===Hebrew Bible===
In the Hebrew Bible, Gabriel appears to the prophet Daniel to explain his visions (Daniel 8:15–26, 9:21–27). Later, in Daniel&#x27;s final vision, an angel, not named but likely Gabriel again, appears to him and speaks of receiving help from prince Michael in battle against the prince of Persia (Daniel 10:13, 21) and also Michael&#x27;s role in times to come (Daniel 12:1). These are the first instances of a named angel in the Bible. Gabriel&#x27;s main function in Daniel is that of revealer, responsible for interpreting Daniel&#x27;s visions, a role he continues to have in later traditions.

===Rabbinic Judaism===
Gabriel, () is interpreted by Talmudic rabbis to be the &quot;man in linen&quot; mentioned in the Book of Daniel and the Book of Ezekiel. Talmudic Judaism understands the angel in the Book of Ezekiel, who was sent to destroy Jerusalem, to be Gabriel. According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, Gabriel takes the form of a man, and stands at the left hand of God. Shimon ben Lakish (Syria Palaestina, 3rd century) concluded that the angelic names of Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel came out of the Babylonian exile (Gen. Rab. 48:9). Alongside the archangel Michael, Gabriel is described as the guardian angel of Israel, defending this people against the angels of the other nations.

===Mystical Judaism===
In Kabbalah, Gabriel is identified with the sefira of Yesod. Gabriel also has a prominent role as one of God&#x27;s archangels in the Kabbalah literature. There, Gabriel is portrayed as working in concert with Michael as part of God&#x27;s court. Gabriel is not to be prayed to because only God can answer prayers and sends Gabriel as his agent.

According to Jewish mythology, in the Garden of Eden there is a tree of life or the &quot;tree of souls&quot; that blossoms and produces new souls, which fall into the Guf, the treasury of souls. Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand.

In Islam, the tree of souls is referred to as the Sidrat al-Muntaha (and is identified as a &quot;Ziziphus spina-christi&quot;).

==Christianity==
===New Testament===

Gabriel&#x27;s first appearance in the New Testament concerns the annunciation of the birth of John the Baptist. John&#x27;s father Zachariah, a priest of the course of Abia, () was childless because his wife Elisabeth was barren. An angel appears to Zacharias while he is ministering in the Temple to announce the birth of his son. When Zachariah questions the angel, the angel gives his name as Gabriel:

After completing his required week of ministry, Zacharias returns to his home and his wife Elizabeth conceives. After she has completed five months of her pregnancy (), Gabriel appears again, now to Mary, to announce the birth of Jesus:

Gabriel only appears by name in those two passages in Luke. In the first passage the angel identified himself as Gabriel, but in the second it is Luke who identified him as Gabriel. The only other named angels in the New Testament are Michael the Archangel (in ) and Abaddon (in ). Believers are expressly warned not to worship angels in two New Testament passages: and .

===Intertestamental literature===
Gabriel is not called an archangel in the canonical Bible. However, the intertestamental period (roughly 200 BC – 50 AD) produced a wealth of literature, much of it having an apocalyptic orientation. The names and ranks of angels and devils were greatly expanded in this literature, and each had particular duties and status before God. This was the period when Gabriel was first referred to as an archangel.

In 1 Enoch 9:1–3, Gabriel, along with Michael, Uriel, and Suriel, &quot;saw much blood being shed upon the earth&quot; (9:1) and heard the souls of men cry, &quot;Bring our cause before the Most High&quot; (). In 1 Enoch 10:1, the reply came from &quot;the Most High, the Holy and Great One&quot; who sent forth agents, including Gabriel—

Gabriel is the fifth of the five angels who keep watch: &quot;Gabriel, one of the holy angels, who is over Paradise and the serpents and the Cherubim&quot;. ()
When Enoch asked who the four figures were that he had seen:

===Gnosticism===
The Christian movement of Gnosticism paid special attention to angels as beings belonging to a pantheon of spiritual forces involved in the creation of the world. According to one ancient Gnostic manuscript, the Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit, Gabriel is a divine being and inhabitant of the Pleroma who existed prior to the Demiurge.

===Medieval Christian traditions===
In a famous early work, the &quot;four homilies on the &quot;Missus Est&quot;, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153 AD) interpreted Gabriel&#x27;s name as &quot;the strength of God&quot;, and his symbolic function in the gospel story as announcement of the strength or virtue of Christ, both as the strength of God incarnate and as the strength given by God to the timorous people who would bring into the world a fearful and troublesome event. &quot;Therefore it was an opportune choice that designated Gabriel for the work he had to accomplish, or rather, because he was to accomplish it therefore he was called Gabriel.&quot;

====Feast day====
The feast day of Saint Gabriel the Archangel was exclusively celebrated on 18 March according to many sources dating between 1588 and 1921; unusually, a source published in 1856 has the feast celebrated on 7 April for unknown reasons (a parenthetical note states that the day is normally celebrated on 18 March). Writer Elizabeth Drayson mentions the feast being celebrated on 18 March 1588 in her 2013 book &quot;The Lead Books of Granada&quot;.

One of the oldest out-of-print sources placing the feast on 18 March, first published in 1608, is &quot;Flos sanctorum: historia general de la vida y hechos de Jesu-Christo ... y de los santos de que reza y haze fiesta la Iglesia Catholica ...&quot; by the Spanish writer Alonso de Villegas; a newer edition of this book was published in 1794. Another source published in Ireland in 1886 the &quot;Irish Ecclesiastical Record&quot; also mentions 18 March.

The feast of Saint Gabriel was included by Pope Benedict XV in the General Roman Calendar in 1921, for celebration on 24 March. In 1969, the day was officially transferred to 29 September for celebration in conjunction with the feast of the archangels Ss. Michael and Raphael. The Church of England has also adopted the 29 September date, known as Michaelmas.

The Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches that follow the Byzantine Rite celebrate his feast day (Synaxis of the Archangel Michael and the Other Bodiless Powers) on 8 November (for those churches that follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 8 November currently falls on 21 November of the modern Gregorian Calendar, a difference of 13 days). Eastern Orthodox commemorate him, not only on his November feast, but also on two other days:

* 26 March is the &quot;Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel&quot; and celebrates his role in the Annunciation (eavetaking of the Annunciation)
* 13 July is also known as the &quot;Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel&quot; and celebrates all the appearances and miracles attributed to Gabriel throughout history. The feast was first established on Mount Athos when, in the 9th century, during the reign of Emperor Basil II and Empress Constantina Porphyrogenitus and while Nicholas Chrysoverges was Patriarch of Constantinople, the Archangel appeared in a cell near Karyes, where he wrote with his finger on a stone tablet the hymn to the Theotokos, &quot;It is truly meet ...&quot;.

Saint Gabriel the Archangel is commemorated on the vigil of the Feast of the Annunciation by Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate and ROCOR Western Rite.

The Coptic Orthodox Church celebrates his feast on 13 Paoni, 22 Koiak and 26 Paoni.

The Ethiopian Church celebrates his feast on 18 December (in the Ethiopian calendar), with a sizeable number of its believers making a pilgrimage to a church dedicated to &quot;Saint Gabriel&quot; in Kulubi and Wonkshet on that day.

In the Lutheran Churches, Gabriel is celebrated on the Feast of the Archangels on 29 September.

Additionally, Gabriel is the patron saint of messengers, those who work for broadcasting and telecommunications such as radio and television, postal workers, clerics, diplomats, and stamp collectors.

==== Gabriel&#x27;s horn ====

A familiar image of Gabriel has him blowing a trumpet blast to announce the resurrection of the dead at the end of time. However, though the Bible mentions a trumpet blast preceding the resurrection of the dead, it never specifies Gabriel as the trumpeter. Different passages state different things: the angels of the Son of Man (Matthew 24:31); the voice of the Son of God (John 5:25–29); God&#x27;s trumpet (I Thessalonians 4:16); seven angels sounding a series of blasts (Revelation 8–11); or simply &quot;a trumpet will sound&quot; (I Corinthians 15:52). Likewise the early Christian Church Fathers do not mention Gabriel as a trumpeter; and in Jewish and Muslim traditions, Gabriel is again not identified as a trumpeter.
The earliest known identification of Gabriel as a trumpeter comes from the Hymn of the Armenian Saint Nerses Shnorhali, &quot;for Protection in the Night&quot;:

The sound of Gabriel&#x27;s trumpet on the last night, make us worthy to hear, and to stand on your right hand among the sheep with lanterns of inextinguishable light; to be like the five wise virgins, so that with the bridegroom in the bride chamber we, his spiritual brides may enter into glory.

In 1455, in Armenian art, there is an illustration in an Armenian manuscript showing Gabriel sounding his trumpet as the dead climb out of their graves.

===Evangelical Christian traditions===
The image of Gabriel&#x27;s trumpet blast to announce the end of time was taken up in Evangelical Christianity, where it became widespread, notably in Negro spirituals.

An earlier example occurs in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667):
&lt;poem&gt;
Betwixt these rockie pillars Gabriel sat
Chief of the Angelic guards (IV.545f) ...
He ended, and the Son gave signal high
To the bright minister that watch&#x27;d, he blew
His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
When God descended, and perhaps once more
To sound at general doom. (XI.72ff).
&lt;/poem&gt;

It is unclear how the Armenian conception inspired Milton and the spirituals, though they presumably have a common source.

====Latter-day Saints====
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints theology, Gabriel is believed to have lived a mortal life as the prophet Noah. The two are regarded as the same individual; Noah being his mortal name and Gabriel being his heavenly name.

== Islam ==

Gabriel (; also or &quot;Jabrāʾīl&quot;, derived from the ) in many places in Qur&#x27;an, is revered as one of the primary archangels and as the Angel of Revelation in Islam. He is primarily mentioned in the verses , and of the Quran. However, the Quranic text doesn&#x27;t refer to him as an angel. In the Quran, the archangel Gabriel appears named in and , as well as in , where he is mentioned along with the archangel Michael.

Tafsir (Exegetical Quranic literature) narrates that Muhammad saw the archangel Gabriel in his full angelic splendor only twice, the first time being when he received his first revelation. As the Hebrew Bible portrays Gabriel as a celestial messenger sent to Daniel, and in the New Testament to Mary, mother of Jesus, and Zechariah, Islamic tradition holds that Gabriel was sent to numerous pre-Islamic Biblical prophets with revelation and divine injunctions, including Adam, whom Muslims believe was consoled by Gabriel sometime after the Fall, too. He is known by many names in Islam, such as &quot;keeper of holiness&quot;. In Hadith traditions, Jibril is said to have six hundred wings.

=== Tasks ===
Muslims believe that Gabriel was mainly tasked with transmitting the scriptures from God to the prophets and messengers, as Asbab al-Nuzul or revelation when Muhammad was questioned which angel is revealing the holy scriptures revelation, and Muhammad told the Jews it is revealed by Gabriel who is tasked to it.

Muslims also revere Gabriel for several events that predate what they regard as the first revelation narrated in the Quran. Muslims believe that Gabriel was the angel who informed Zechariah of the Nativity of John the Baptist, as well as Mary about the future nativity of Jesus; and that Gabriel was one of three angels who had earlier informed Abraham of the birth of Isaac (). Gabriel also makes a famous appearance in the Hadith of Gabriel, in which he questions Muhammad on the core tenets of Islam.

Gabriel is also believed to have delivered punishment from God to the Sodomites by leveling the entire city of Sodom with a tip of his wing. According to a Hadith narrated by Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, which is compiled by al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi, Gabriel has the ability to regulate feeling or perception in humans, particularly happiness or sadness.

Gabriel is believed to have helped Muhammad overcome his adversaries significantly against an ifrit during the Night Journey. Gabriel is also believed to have helped Muhammad overcome his adversaries during the Battle of Badr, where according to scholars and clerics of Islam, the various hadiths, both authentics and inauthentics, has mentioned that Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, and thousands of best angels from third level of heaven, all came to the battle of Badr by impersonating the appearance of Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, a Companions of the Prophet and bodyguard of the prophet. This is deemed as Zubayr personal honor according to Islamic belief. Meanwhile, Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri has recorded in his historiography works of Quran and Hadith revelation in Prophetic biography, that Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas testified he saw two unidentified warriors clad in white had protected Muhammad during the Battle of Uhud, that later being confirmed by Muhammad those two unidentified warriors were Jibril and Mikail in disguise.

Moreover, he is believed to have further encouraged Muhammad to wage war and attack the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza. Another appearance of Gabriel in Islamic religious texts were found in numerous Hadiths during the Battle of Hunayn, where the Gabriel stood next to Muhammad.

Other Islamic texts and some Apocryphal literature also supported Gabriel&#x27;s role as a celestial warrior. Though alternate theories exist, whether the occurrence of the Holy Spirit in the Quran refers to Gabriel or not, remains an issue of scholarly debate. However, a clear distinction between apocryphal and Quranic references to Gabriel is that the former doesn&#x27;t designate him as the Holy Spirit in the First Book of Enoch, which narrates the story of Gabriel defeating the Nephilim.

==Yezidi tradition==
Yazidis consider Gabriel one of the Seven Mysteries, the heptad to which God entrusted the world, and sometimes identified with the archangel Melek Taus.

==Art, entertainment, and media==
Angels are described as pure spirits. The lack of a defined form allows artists wide latitude in depicting them. Amelia R. Brown draws comparisons in Byzantine iconography between portrayals of angels and the conventions used to depict court eunuchs. Mainly from the Caucasus, they tended to have light eyes, hair, and skin; and those &quot;castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards ...&quot; As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that &quot;Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch&quot;. Some recent popular works on angels consider Gabriel to be female or androgynous.

Daniel 8:15 describes Gabriel as appearing in the &quot;likeness of man&quot; and in Daniel 9:21 he is referred to as &quot;the man Gabriel&quot;.

Goldner, chairman of the department of prints and drawings at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art, suggested that the sketch was for a stained glass window. &quot;The fact that the archangel is an ordinary-looking person and not an idealized boy is typical of the artist&quot;, said Goldner.

<doc id="159526" wikidata="Q272852" url="?curid=159526" title="Anne Fausto-Sterling">
<text>Anne Fausto-Sterling ( Sterling; born July 30, 1944) is an American sexologist who has written extensively on the social construction of gender, sexual identity, gender identity, gender roles, and intersexuality. She is the Nancy Duke Lewis Professor Emerita of Biology and Gender Studies at Brown University.

==Life and career==
Fausto-Sterling&#x27;s mother, Dorothy Sterling, was a noted writer and historian while her father was also a published writer. Fausto-Sterling received her Bachelor of Arts degree in zoology from the University of Wisconsin in 1965 and her Ph.D. in developmental genetics from Brown University in 1970. After earning her Ph.D. she joined the faculty of Brown, where she was appointed Nancy Duke Lewis Professor of Biology and Gender Studies.

In a 1993 paper titled &quot;&quot;, Fausto-Sterling laid out a thought experiment considering an alternative model of gender containing five sexes: male, female, merm, ferm, and herm.
She later said that the paper &quot;had intended to be provocative, but I had also written with tongue firmly in cheek&quot;.

Fausto-Sterling has written two books intended for a general audience. The first of those books, &quot;Myths of Gender&quot;, was first published in 1985.
Her second book for the general public is &quot;Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality&quot;, published in 2000.
In the book she sets out to &quot;convince readers of the need for theories that allow for a good deal of human variation and that integrate the analytical powers of the biological and the social into the systematic analysis of human development.&quot;

Fausto-Sterling married Paula Vogel, a Yale professor and Pulitzer-winning playwright, in 2004.
She has served on the editorial board of the journal &quot;Perspectives in Biology and Medicine&quot; and on the advisory board of the feminist academic journal &quot;Signs&quot;.
She retired from Brown University in 2014, after 44 years on the faculty.

== Reception ==

Historian of science Evelynn M. Hammonds describes Fausto-Sterling as one of the most influential feminist scientists of her generation. Reviewing &quot;Myths of Gender&quot; in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Elaine Kendall writes that &quot;Her most dramatic and valuable chapters concentrate upon the lingering educational misapprehensions operating to keep women away from the &#x27;hard&#x27; sciences and out of such lucrative fields as engineering, sidetracking them instead into lower-paying careers in the humanities or the &#x27;nurturant&#x27; professions.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; describes Fausto-Sterling&#x27;s work as &quot;insightful&quot;, stating that &quot;Sexing the Body&quot; &quot;offers profound challenges to scientific research, the creation of social policy and the future of feminist and gender theory.&quot;

Fausto-Sterling&#x27;s sexual continuum argument has not gained the same prominence in the biological sciences as it has in gender studies. French anthropologist Priscille Touraille called Fausto-Sterling an isolated case which has failed to create a consensus or controversy among biologists. Physician and psychologist Leonard Sax criticized Fausto-Sterling&#x27;s theory of a sexual continuum. He also argued that her claim that around 1.7% of births are intersex is incorrect, because most of the conditions she considered intersex are not considered intersex from a clinical perspective. Philosopher of science David N. Stamos argued that Fausto-Sterling&#x27;s theory of a sexual continuum is problematic because sex, for Stamos, is defined by gamete type. Notably, Fausto-Sterling pre-empts these objections, describing these modern definitions of intersexuality as a historically recent innovation aimed at defining intersexuality out of existence.

The psychologist Suzanne Kessler, in her book &quot;Lessons from the Intersexed&quot;, criticized Fausto-Sterling&#x27;s analysis in &quot;The Five Sexes&quot; because it &quot;still gives genitals...primary signifying status and ignores the fact that in the everyday world gender attributions are made without access to genital inspection.&quot; Kessler further commented that &quot;What has primacy in everyday life is the gender that is performed, regardless of the flesh&#x27;s configuration under the clothes.&quot; In a later paper titled &quot;The Five Sexes, Revisited&quot;, Fausto-Sterling wrote that she now agreed with Kessler&#x27;s objections to the five-sex theory, and believed that sexual diversity might instead fit into a broader picture of possibilities for each social gender.

<text>Air Atlanta Icelandic is a charter and ACMI airline based in Kópavogur, Iceland. It specialises in leasing aircraft on an ACMI (Aircraft, Crews, Maintenance, Insurance) and wet lease basis to airlines worldwide needing extra passenger and cargo capacity. It also operates charter services. The company operates in different countries and has bases worldwide.

== History ==

The airline was established on 10 February 1986 by Captain Arngrímur Jóhannsson and his wife, Þóra Guðmundsdóttir. It started operations in 1986. Its first contract came when Caribbean Airways wet-leased a Boeing 707-320 from them for its London to Barbados flights. In 1988, the airline leased planes for Air Afrique to be used during the Hajj pilgrimage trips. This would become an important part of the structure of Air Atlanta Icelandic later on. Sudan Airways and Lufthansa were among the other airlines that benefited from leasing passenger airplanes from Air Atlanta Icelandic during the late 1980s, as well as Finnair, which leased a Boeing 737 from the Icelandic company.

It was in 1991 that Air Atlanta Icelandic was able to take passengers to the sky with its own airline operation. Its first flight was with a Lockheed L-1011-500 plane. Later in 1992, Air Atlanta Icelandic participated in United Nations peacekeeper airlifts, flying the UN representatives from the former Yugoslavia to Nigeria and France.

In 1993, the Boeing 747 arrived, and Saudia became one of the first airlines to lease that plane from Air Atlanta Icelandic, also for Hajj flights. After signing a contract with Samvinn Travel, Air Atlanta Icelandic began operating domestic charter flights as well. Later in 1993, a flight from Phnom Penh to Bangkok was launched using a Boeing 737-200.

By 1994, Air Atlanta Icelandic had obtained rights to operate service from many other countries, including the United States, from where it had a flight to Colombia; and the Philippines, from where it was allowed to operate domestic charter flights. About that time, it began to offer flights within Europe and began service to Portugal.

In 1996, a couple rented an Air Atlanta Icelandic Lockheed L-1011-500 to have a sky-wedding. The couple and its wedding guests were treated to a flight over the Arctic Circle, while the wedding was performed inside of the jet.

1997 saw the arrival of contracts with airlines such as Britannia Airways and Iberia, which would use an Air Atlanta Icelandic plane for its routes from Barajas International Airport in Madrid to José Martí International Airport in Havana and to other points in the Caribbean. That year also saw the arrival of the airline&#x27;s first Boeing 747SP plane, which would later be utilized by government officials, sports teams, The Rolling Stones, and others.

In 1998, Air Atlanta Icelandic leased planes for British Airways. In 1999, Magnus G. Thorstenn was named the company&#x27;s new CEO. The airline became a fully wide bodied airplane airline in 1999 when it sold the last of its Boeing 737s. In 2000, Air India joined the growing list of airlines that have leased airplanes from Air Atlanta Icelandic airlines.

In 2003, Air Atlanta Icelandic expanded into the United Kingdom with its subsidiary, Air Atlanta Europe, which operated Boeing 747s ad hoc, charter and for the Florida tour operator, Travel City Direct.

In March 2004, the company acquired a 40.5% stake in the UK charter airline Excel Airways. That stake later increased to 76.9%. In January 2005, the Avion Group was formed, and Air Atlanta Icelandic and Islandsflug merged under the Air Atlanta Icelandic brand name.

In 2005, the Avion Group acquired Eimskip, a leading Icelandic sea transportation company, and Travel City Direct, a UK holiday company and the airline Icebird Airlines. In 2006, the Avion Group announced the purchase of the entire issued share capital of French charter airline Star Airlines, the second largest charter airline in the French market. Star Airlines operated charter flights mainly to destinations in Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean, in addition to regular services to Lebanon, Male, and cities in Mexico.

In June 2006, Air Atlanta Icelandic wet-leased one Boeing 747-200 to Yangtze River Express to operate cargo freight between Shanghai - Anchorage - Los Angeles.

In October 2006, the Avion Group changed its name to HF Eimskipafélag Íslands, and at the same time sold UK Leisure Group Excel as well as 51% of Avion Aircraft Trading. A decision was also made to merge both Excel Airways and Air Atlanta Europe into one airline. This was completed by October 2006.

In mid-2007, the airline decided to shift its focus to air cargo operations. The airline planned to move to cargo aircraft and laid off most of its passenger aircraft aircrew. Today, the company focuses on both passenger aircraft and cargo aircraft.

Britflights cancelled plans to operate aircraft from Air Atlanta Icelandic from the UK to Canada from June 2011, citing fuel uncertainties.

Air Atlanta Icelandic operated two Boeing 747-400s for National Airlines (N8) in the year 2011. One flew cargo charter flights and the other one was wet-leased to Cargolux for a period of time.

In December 2015, three former Air Atlanta Icelandic Boeing 747 registered TF-ARH, TF-ARM and TF-ARN were reported abandoned at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Air Atlanta Icelandic senior vice president of sales and marketing Baldvin M. Hermannsson said that the three aircraft had belonged to Air Atlanta, but were returned to their owner in 2010.

In 2016, the airline provided a Boeing 747-428 (registration TF-AAK) to the heavy metal band Iron Maiden for the Book of Souls World Tour, which replaced a modified Astraeus Airlines 757 as &quot;Ed Force One&quot;. On 12 March, the aircraft sustained damage to engines 1 and 2 while being towed for refueling at Santiago, Chile. The extent of the damage required the band and its crew to charter additional aircraft to continue touring through Argentina and Brazil while the aircraft awaited repairs at Santiago International Airport. Repairs involving replacing both port-side engines, cowlings, and reversers were completed by 20 March and the aircraft returned to the tour.

== Destinations ==
Air Atlanta Icelandic operates worldwide passenger and cargo flights as charters and ACMI services for various customers. For example, as of January 2012, the airline operated cargo flights on behalf of Saudia from their hub in Jeddah to Brussels, Amsterdam, Frankfurt (Hahn), Dhaka, Hong Kong, Houston, New York, and Greenville–Spartanburg.

==Fleet==
As of May 2022, the Air Atlanta Icelandic fleet consists of the following aircraft:


==Accidents and incidents==
*On November 7, 2004, an Air Atlanta Boeing 747 freighter was taking off but airport tower workers noticed a fire in one of the engines. There was also a loud sound at around the same time and the aircraft crashed. The aircraft was heavily damaged but there were no fatalities.
*On 25 March 2008, an Air Atlanta Icelandic aircraft operating for Saudi Arabian Airlines as Flight 810 (TF-ARS) from Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz Airport, Madinah made an unscheduled landing at Zia International Airport (now Shahjalal International Airport), Dhaka. During the landing roll the tower controller reported that he saw a fire on the right hand wing. Upon vacating the runway, the crew received a fire indication for engine number three. The fire extinguisher was activated and all engines were shut down. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-357, which was damaged beyond repair, was successfully evacuated. Only minor injuries were incurred. Investigations revealed a fuel leak where the fuel enters the front spar for engine number three.
* On November 9, 2023, a horse became loose on an Air Atlanta Icelandic 747 headed from New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International airport to Liege, Belgium.

<text>An āyah (, ; ) is a &quot;verse&quot; in the Qur&#x27;an, one of the statements of varying length that make up the chapters (&quot;surah&quot;) of the Qur&#x27;an and are marked by a number. In a purely linguistic context the word means &quot;evidence&quot;, &quot;sign&quot; or &quot;miracle&quot;, and thus may refer to things other than Qur&#x27;anic verses, such as religious obligations (&quot;āyat taklīfiyyah&quot;) or cosmic phenomena (&quot;āyat takwīniyyah&quot;). In the Qur&#x27;an it is referred to with both connotations in several verses such as:

==Overview of the meaning==
Although meaning &quot;verse&quot; when using the Quran, it is doubtful whether &quot;āyah&quot; means anything other than &quot;sign&quot;, &quot;proof&quot;, or &quot;remarkable event&quot; in the Quran&#x27;s text. The &quot;signs&quot; refer to various phenomena, ranging from the universe, its creation, the alternation between day and night, rainfall, and the life and growth of plants. Other references are to miracles or to the rewards of belief and the fate of unbelievers. For example:

: &quot;And of his signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and what He has dispersed throughout them of creatures.&quot; (Q42:29)
: &quot;And a sign for them is the dead earth. We have brought it to life and brought forth from it grain, and from it, they eat.&quot; (Q36:33)
: &quot;... and they denied him; therefore we destroyed them. Herein is indeed a sign yet most of them are not believers.&quot; (Q26:139)
: &quot;... you are but a mortal like us. So bring some sign if you are of the truthful.&quot; (Q26:154)

Chapters (&quot;surah&quot;) in the Quran consist of several verses, varying in number from 3 to 286. Within a long chapter, the verses may be further grouped into thematic sequences passages.

For the purpose of interpretation, the verses are separated into two groups: those that are clear and unambiguous (&quot;muhkam&quot;) and those that are ambiguous (&quot;mutashabeh&quot;). This distinction is based on the Quran itself: &quot;It is God Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are &#x27;clear&#x27;, they are the foundation of the Book. Others are &#x27;allegorical&#x27; but those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except God. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: We believe in the Book, the whole of it is from our Lord. And none will grasp the Message except men of understanding.&quot;

An incorrect anti-Islamic claim is that the number of verses in the Quran is 6,666. In fact, the total number of verses in the Quran is 6,236 excluding &quot;Bismillah&quot; and 6,348 including &quot;Bismillah&quot;. (There are 114 chapters in the Quran, however there are only 112 unnumbered &quot;Bismillah&quot;&#x27;s because Surah At-Tawbah does not have one at the beginning and fatiha&#x27;s is numbered, there is another Bismillah in the middle of āyah 30 of Surah An-Naml but it&#x27;s not included because it has already been added as a verse.)

The Unicode symbols for a Quran verse, including U+06DD (۝), and U+08E2 (࣢).

The first āyah in the Quran from a chronological order is &quot;Read [O Muhammad!] in the name of your Lord who created&quot; (Q96:1) from surah Al-Alaq. The first āyah from a traditional order is &quot;In the name of God, the Compassionate Merciful One&quot; from surah Al-Fatiha. The first ayahs after the opening surah are &quot;ʾalif-lām-mīm. This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance for the God-fearing&quot;, from surah Al-Baqara.

<text>XBoard is a graphical user interface chessboard for chess engines under the X Window System. It is developed and maintained as free software by the GNU project. WinBoard is a port of XBoard to run natively on Microsoft Windows.

==Overview==
Originally developed by Tim Mann as a front end for the GNU Chess engine, XBoard eventually came to be described as a graphical user interface for XBoard engines. It also acts as a client for Internet Chess Servers, and e-mail chess, and can allow the user to play through saved games.

XBoard/WinBoard remain updated, and the Chess Engine Communication Protocol has been extended to meet the needs of modern engines (which have features such as hash tables, multi-processing and end-game tables, which could not be controlled through the old protocol).

XBoard/WinBoard also fully support engines that play chess variants, such as Fairy-Max. This means the GUI is able to display a wide range of variants such as xiangqi (Chinese chess), shogi (Japanese chess), makruk (Thai chess), Crazyhouse, Capablanca Chess and many other Western variants on boards of various sizes. It offers a Westernized representation for these games, but the almost limitless configurability of XBoard/WinBoard also allows a high-quality representation of non-Western style games.

Another computer chess protocol is the Universal Chess Interface (UCI). XBoard/WinBoard supports this protocol (and its dialects USI and UCCI, which are in common use for shogi and Chinese chess) through adapter programs such as Polyglot and UCI2WB.

Since 2014 there exists a special version of XBoard that better integrates with Apple&#x27;s OS X. It is distributed from WinBoard forum as an OS X App, including several engines (for chess and many chess variants), and adapters for running engines in non-natively supported protocols. It also contains supporting software for connecting with the popular Internet Chess Servers FICS and ICC for on-line play. XBoard OS X Apps that specifically configure XBoard for oriental-style shogi or xiangqi are also available.

WinBoard is a version of XBoard adapted to MS Windows, and is available in a similar package.
==Fairy-Max==

Fairy-Max is a free and open source chess engine which can play orthodox chess as well as chess variants. Among its features is the ability of users to define and use their own custom variant chess pieces for use in games.

Fairy-Max was derived from micro-Max (also developed by H.G. Muller), one of the smallest programs to play complete FIDE chess. Therefore, Fairy-Max versioning started with version number 4.8, the version of micro-Max used.

=== Description ===
The Fairy-Max module is a chess engine only, but is packaged with XBoard, which serves as the graphical user interface. Users can play against the Fairy-Max engine, or play the engine against other engines. It can also be set up to play two armies against each other, both using the Fairy-Max engine, for the purpose of analyzing chess moves, chess variants, or variant chess pieces.

=== Capabilities ===
Besides classical FIDE chess, Fairy-Max is provided with a large selection of pre-defined games using fairy chess pieces, including shatranj (ancient Iranian chess), xiangqi (Chinese chess), shogi (Japanese chess), makruk (Thai chess), King of the Hill, Capablanca Chess, Courier chess, Berolina chess, Seirawan chess and other chess variants. Users are also able to specify their own board sizes, and define custom chess pieces, so that user-defined chess variants can also be played. Chessboards can be defined with a maximum size of 14 files in width, and 16 ranks in depth.

=== Playing strength ===
The engine&#x27;s Elo rating fluctuates at around 1900 when playing orthodox chess in CCRL 40/40 chess engine tournament, which roughly corresponds to class A human player.

The author of the program has said &quot;the goal of Fairy-Max is to make an entertaining but beatable opponent to play against in all kind of chess variants.&quot;

<text>The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) was a non-profit advocacy group founded in 1993 by Cheryl Chase to end shame, secrecy, and unnecessary genital surgeries on intersex people. Other notable members included Morgan Holmes, Max Beck, Howard (Tiger) Devore, Esther Morris Leidolf and Alice Dreger. The organization closed in June 2008, and has been succeeded by a number of health, civil and human rights organizations including interACT.

==Advocacy==

===Physical integrity and bodily autonomy===
ISNA stated that newborn intersex genitals should not be operated on, unless they need to be in order to maintain the child&#x27;s physical health. It was (and to some extent still is) a common belief that a child&#x27;s genitals needed to conform to average genitals of a male or female, so in the first 24 hours after birth, doctors could perform &quot;extensive reconstructive surgery in order to avoid damage to the child&#x27;s mental health&quot; (56). On the other hand, the ISNA claimed there is &quot;no evidence that children who grow up with intersex genitals are worse off psychologically than those who are altered&quot; and that there is &quot;no evidence that early surgery relieves parental distress&quot;. They believed it to be inhumane to choose someone&#x27;s genitals for them. This being said, the ISNA did not condemn surgery in general, and believed that intersex people should be allowed to opt for genital reconstruction, if they want to, when they can fully consent to the operations themselves.

Alice Dreger has described how the work of clinical psychologist and surgeries survivor Tiger Devore was integral to the work of ISNA:

The ISNA advocated a move from a &quot;Concealment-Centered Model&quot; to a Patient-Centered Model. This push was to move away from a model that teaches both that &quot;intersex is a rare anatomical abnormality&quot; and that there needs to be immediate surgery to normalize the child&#x27;s abnormal genitals, and moved toward the idea that &quot;intersex is a relatively common anatomical variation from the &#x27;standard&#x27; male and female types&quot;. The attempt is to treat intersex as something that is natural, as to not ostracize the intersex community, and to allow intersex people to be treated with the same ethical principles that doctors show to any other patient.

The Patient-Centered Model believes that &quot;psychological distress is a legitimate concern and should be addressed by properly trained professionals&quot;. This means that both intersex people and family members who feel burdened in any way should seek both the help of counselors trained in sex and gender issues and the support from a community of peers experiencing the same situation. This allows a network of support to help everyone through any trying times that might arise. The model also states that &quot;care should be more focused on addressing stigma, not solely gender assignment and genital appearance.&quot; The Model attempts a more caring approach toward people with intersex characteristics.

Released in August 2006, the Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders was a document published in &quot;Pediatrics&quot; that mapped out a new standard of care for intersex people. According to the ISNA, it made three ground-breaking changes that advocated a Patient-Centered Model, a cautious approach to surgery, and an attempt to get rid of misleading language, all of which were backed by the ISNA. However, the statement still permits surgeries, and both clinicians and civil society organizations question implementation. Intersex scholars such as Georgiann Davis and Morgan Holmes state that, instead, the statement retrenched medical authority over infants and children with intersex conditions.

===First North American demonstration by intersex people===
Members of ISNA held the first ever North American demonstration about intersex issues: a 1996 demonstration by Morgan Holmes, Max Beck and others as &quot;Hermaphrodites with Attitude&quot; outside the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Boston. Georgiann Davis describes how, when the intersex movement began, &quot;medical professional refused to engage intersex activists&quot;, and how rapidly the movement&#x27;s strategy developed. &quot;By the year 2000, Chase was delivering a plenary address to the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, a group she was once protesting against... It marked the first time an activist&#x27;s perspective was solicited by organizers of a major medical conference.&quot;

The 1996 demonstration is now commemorated internationally as Intersex Awareness Day.

===Identification documents===
ISNA, like the 2013 International Intersex Forum believed that &quot;newborns with intersex should be given a gender assignment as boy or girl&quot;. Their reasoning is that they think it would be impossible to know where male ends and intersex begins or where female ends and intersex begins. They want to &quot;make the world a safe place for intersex kids&quot;, and they believe that marking them as a third gender would exile them.

===Publications===

ISNA published the journal &quot;Hermaphrodites with Attitude&quot;, edited by Cheryl Chase, between 1994 and 2005. The first issue appeared in Winter 1994, containing six pages of articles, analysis and case studies, including articles by people with lived experience, activists, doctors and academics. It was distributed to subscribers in five countries and 14 States of the United States.

===Language===
In a significant shift from publishing a regular journal titled &quot;Hermaphrodites with Attitude&quot; and demonstrating using the same name, the last stated goal of the organization was to eradicate what the organization deemed as &quot;misleading language&quot;. The ISNA claimed that nomenclature based on hermaphroditism was stigmatizing to intersex individuals, as well as potentially panic-inducing to parents of intersex children. The suggested solution put forth by the ISNA was to restructure the system of intersex taxonomy and nomenclature to not include the words &#x27;hermaphrodite&#x27;, &#x27;hermaphroditism&#x27;, &#x27;sex reversal&#x27;, or other similar terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.isna.org/node/979&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;standard division of many intersex types into true hermaphroditism, male pseudohermaphroditism, and female pseudohermaphroditism&quot; is described by the ISNA and its advocates as confusing and clinically problematic.

The ISNA attempted to dispel what it sees as &quot;harmful language&quot; by providing information on intersex definitions and prevalence. The Intersex Society of North America stated that the term hermaphrodite is a &quot;mythological term&quot; and a &quot;physiologic impossibility&quot;; true hermaphrodites cannot exist.

While some intersex people seek to reclaim the word &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; with pride to reference themselves (much like the words &quot;dyke&quot; and &quot;queer&quot; have been reclaimed by LBGT people), the ISNA suggested that be avoided. They believed that it will not help the cause of intersex rights and could in fact be counter productive as people would not understand that word is being used as an attempt to empower intersex people, not classify them.

===International work===

ISNA made various efforts to spread intersex activism, and were a resource for a 1999 Colombian court case decision on surgical guidelines for intersex children.

==Closure and succession==

By 2008, even though ISNA felt that they were able to come to a &quot;consensus on improvements to [medical] care&quot; for people born intersex with a large amount of the medical community, they ran into many problems in implementing these ideas. There was a &quot;concern among many healthcare professionals, parents, and mainstream healthcare system funders that ISNA&#x27;s views are biased&quot;, and many of these people feared that they would be shunned by colleagues if it was found out they were associated with the ISNA. The ISNA gave a statement saying that &quot;at present, the new standard of care exists as little more than ideals on paper, thus falling short of its aim[s]&quot; to fulfill its goals. The ISNA decided its best course of action was to &quot;support a new organization with a mission to promote integrated, comprehensive approaches to care that enhance the overall health and well-being of persons [who are intersex] and their families.&quot;

The ISNA website identifies interACT as a successor, and the organization charged with preserving the site as a &quot;historical archive&quot;. The Accord Alliance, which opened in April 2008, was also a successor to ISNA.

Writing in &quot;Sociology of Diagnosis&quot;, Georgiann Davis describes Organisation Intersex International (OII) and ISNA as &quot;activist organisations&quot;. OII continues today with affiliates in many countries. Other intersex and DSD activist and advocacy organisations also continue their work around the world. interACT, Organisation Intersex International, and many other organizations participate in the International Intersex Forum.

<doc id="159533" wikidata="Q1855263" url="?curid=159533" title="Luke Rhinehart">
<text>George Powers Cockcroft (November 15, 1932 – November 6, 2020), widely known by the pen name Luke Rhinehart, was an American novelist, screenwriter, and nonfiction writer. He is best known for his 1971 novel &quot;The Dice Man,&quot; the story of a psychiatrist who experiments with making life decisions based on the roll of a dice.

&quot;The Dice Man&quot; was critically well received and a commercial success. It quickly became and remains a cult classic. It was followed by two spiritual sequels in &quot;Adventures of Wim&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Search for the Dice Man&quot; (1993) as well as a companion volume called &quot;The Book of the Die&quot; (2000). Rhinehart wrote several other novels between 1986 and 2016 though none achieved the success of &quot;The Dice Man&quot;.

==Biography ==
===Early life===
George Powers Cockcroft was born on November 15, 1932, in Albany, New York, to Donald and Elizabeth Cockcroft, both college graduates, his mother from Wellesley College. He was raised in Albany, where his father was an electrical engineer, and his ancestry included Vermont political notables. He attended The Albany Academy, graduating in 1950, and received a BA from Cornell University in 1954 and an MA from Columbia University in 1956. In 1964 he received a PhD in American literature, also from Columbia. After obtaining his PhD, he went into teaching. During his years as a university professor he taught, among other things, courses in Zen and Western literature.

In 1969, while Cockcroft was teaching a study abroad program on the island of Mallorca, an Englishman starting a new publishing house happened to stop at a cafe in the same village, Deià, and was given a partial manuscript of &quot;The Dice Man&quot; to read by Cockcroft. Cockcroft was subsequently offered an advance payment for publication. Shortly afterwards, Cockcroft was encouraged by his course Director to take an early sabbatical from his teaching duties. He remained in Mallorca to complete the novel, after which the publisher sold the American rights to the novel for a large sum, and within a year the film rights, allowing Cockcroft to retire from teaching and become a full time novelist.

===Personal life and family===
Cockroft married his wife, Ann, who would later become a writer of two romance novels and a volume of poetry, on June 30, 1956; together they have three children. His brother, James Cockcroft, is the author of more than 20 books, mostly on Latin American history and society.

The author and his family spent a number of years traveling, sailing, and returning to Mallorca, living in Deià in the late 1960s and early 70s, including time spent on a large catamaran which became the inspiration for the boat in his novel &quot;Long Voyage Back&quot;. In the mid-1970s they returned to the United States and spent 1975 in a sufi commune, before moving to a large old farmhouse and former religious retreat in the foothills of the Berkshires in upstate New York.

===Later life and death===

On 1 August 2012, the &quot;death&quot; of Rhinehart at the age of 79 was announced by email to 25 friends, beginning with the words &quot;It is our pleasure to inform you that Luke Rhinehart is dead&quot;; it was later revealed the &quot;Death Letter&quot; was instigated as a playful hoax by Cockcroft. Reactions ranged from sorrow to gratitude and amusement.

In 2018, Rhinehart expressed a wish to be cremated after his death if he could not be naturally buried legally in the one-acre lake upon his property.

George Cockroft died, aged 87, on 6 November 2020.

==&quot;The Dice Man&quot;==
Rhinehart&#x27;s famous novel &quot;The Dice Man&quot; was published in 1971 and tells the story of a psychiatrist who makes daily decisions based on the casting of dice. The cover bore the confident tagline, &quot;Few novels can change your life. This one will&quot;; in the United States this was altered to read, &quot;This book will change your life&quot;.

Cockcroft has described the origin of the idea for this work variously, and at the time of the publication of this work, &quot;it was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography&quot;, because its protagonist and author were eponymous. Curiosity over its authorship have persisted since its publication. Emmanuel Carrère, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, presented a long-form expose on Cockcroft and the relationship between author and legend in 2019, and in following others, established the author Cockcroft as a life-long English professor living &quot;in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond&quot;, a husband of fifty-years, father of three, and a caregiver to a special needs child.

&quot;The Dice Man&quot; was critically well received. It quickly became, and remains thought of as a cult classic. It initially sold poorly in the United States, but well in Europe, particularly England, Sweden, Denmark, and Spain. Writing in 2017 for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Tanya Gold noted that &quot;over the course of 45 years&quot; it was still in print, had become famous, had devoted fans, and had &quot;sold more than 2m copies in multiple languages&quot; (e.g., as many as 27 languages and 60 countries have been claimed).

In 1995, the BBC called it &quot;one of the fifty most influential books of the last half of the twentieth century,&quot; and in 1999, after one of their reporters experimented, controversially, with dicing, &quot;Loaded&quot; magazine named it &quot;Novel of the Century&quot;. In 2013, Alex Clark of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; chose it as one of the fifty greatest cult books of the last hundred years.

==Works after &quot;The Dice Man&quot;==
===Comic philosophical novels===

A number of works by Luke Rhinehart have a similar style and themes to &quot;The Dice Man,&quot; alternating between first- and third-person voices with selections from fictional documents. In one case, he even quotes from a future book that he did not actually write until more than two decades later. The voices having different characteristics, the novel&#x27;s mood changes accordingly.

Presenting these multiple fragments from multiple viewpoints together results in a &quot;cubist&quot; narrative structure. Of this, Rhinehart stated that they had &quot;always conceived of myself as being multiple – having, you know, a dozen different selves, if not a thousand different selves, at any given moment.&quot;

&quot;Adventures of Wim&quot; is a new interpretation of the story of Wim, a Montauk boy born of a virgin mother, declared the savior of the Montauk nation, and his life quest for Ultimate Truth. The story is told in part through the medium of fictional documents.

&quot;The Search for the Dice Man&quot; (1993), set twenty years after &quot;The Dice Man&quot;, tells the story of Luke Rhinehart&#x27;s son, Larry, who has built a highly successful and stable life after rejecting his father&#x27;s embracing of Chance. On a quest to find his father however, Larry&#x27;s life of order and routine is enveloped in chaos, the legacy of his father&#x27;s work.

From a draft written at the same time as &quot;The Dice Man&quot;, &quot;Naked Before the World&quot; (2008) celebrates the lives of both hippies and the establishment in 1960s Mallorca through the story of Katya, a naive Catholic art student who arrives on the island to study. Katya is thrown into a world of artists, frauds, sex, drugs and the struggle to discover who she wants to be.

In &quot;Jesus Invades George: An Alternative History&quot; (2013), which takes place in 2007, then-sitting President George W. Bush is possessed by the spirit of Jesus Christ. The story playfully reveals and deconstructs the hypocrisy of government and modern politics.

In &quot;Invasion&quot; (2016), aliens invade Earth for the sole purpose of having fun. Hyper-intelligent and able to morph into multiple forms, they play games with culture and infrastructure, from computer networks and social media to corporate culture and human relationships. The resulting mayhem reveals the primitive nature of our society, and offers an alternative vision for the human race. A sequel is yet to be published entitled &quot;The Hairy Balls and the End of Civilization&quot;.

===Conventional novels===
&quot;Matari&quot; (1975)  (republished as &quot;White Wind, Black Rider&quot; (2008)) is historical fiction set in 18th Century Japan, the beautiful Matari is joined by two zen poets as she flees from her husband, a samurai lord who is giving chase with intent to murder her. A lyrical and poetic tale of love, honor and morality.

&quot;Long Voyage Back&quot; (1983) is a nautical action-adventure novel following a group of people sailing a trimaran, and their struggle for survival as they escape the aftermath of nuclear war.

===Nonfiction===
&quot;The Book of est&quot; (1976) is a narrative account of Werner Erhard&#x27;s controversial large-group awareness training personal transformation course, Erhard Seminars Training, which began in 1971. The reader is put in the place of a participant in order to vicariously &quot;experience&quot; the training. Erhard wrote a foreword to the book.

&quot;The Book of the Die&quot; (2000) is &quot;handbook of dice living&quot; intended to help readers to embrace Chance and live more freely. It follows the philosophy that people must give up their illusion that a self-direction can control life; they must let go. A collection of proverbs, essays, cartoons, poems and scenes from movies form this guide to creating a more playful and unpredictable life.

===Other work===
Rhinehart wrote nine screenplays: five were based directly on his novels: &quot;The Dice Man&quot;, &quot;The Search for the Dice Man&quot;, &quot;Whim&quot;, &quot;Naked Before the World&quot;, and &quot;White Wind, Black Rider&quot;. Two others were direct &quot;Dice Man&quot; sequels featuring the original character: &quot;The Dice Lady&quot; (co-written with Peter Forbes), and &quot;Last Roll of the Die&quot; (co-written with Nick Mead). Two other screenplays, &quot;Mawson&quot; and &quot;Picton&#x27;s Chance&quot; were original concepts.

A music and spoken word album, &quot;The Dice Man Speaks&quot; featuring the pseudonymous Rhinehart and Sputnik Weazel was released in 2018. On it, Luke Rhinehart performs spoken word passages over acoustic and electronic music by Weazel.

==Cultural influence==
Richard Branson has said he used dice when signing bands in the early days of Virgin Records after reading &quot;The Dice Man&quot; and deciding to &quot;follow its teachings.&quot;

Journalist Ben Marshall spent two years from 1998 to 2000 experimenting with dice and reporting his experiences in &quot;Loaded&quot; magazine; &quot;Loaded&quot; subsequently named Cockcroft/Rhinehart as novelist of the century.

A four-season television travel series called &quot;The Diceman&quot; was broadcast between 1998 and 2000 by the Discovery Channel in which the destinations and activities of the participants were determined by the roll of a die.

UK Channel 4&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Diceworld&quot; (1999, Paul Wilmshurst directing), a 50-minute television documentary about Cockcroft/Rhinehart and some of the people influenced by his novels contributed to a resurgence of interest in Cockcroft/Rhinehart&#x27;s books. A further documentary was produced in 2004, a collaboration between Cockcroft/Rhinehart and director Nick Mead, entitled &quot;Dice Life: The Random Mind of Luke Rhinehart&quot;.

Inspired by &quot;The Dice Man&quot; and written by Paul Lucas, a play called &quot;The Dice House&quot; premiered in the United Kingdom in 2001, and went on to staging at the Arts Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in 2004. The text of Lucas&#x27;s play was published by Faber &amp; Faber in 2001 and by Bloomsbury in 2012.

In music, a 1979 song by The Fall called &quot;Dice Man&quot; takes its title and general concept from the book. The Talk Talk song &quot;Such A Shame&quot; (1984) was inspired by &quot;The Dice Man&quot;. In 1992 British musician Richard D. James used the pseudonym The Dice Man for the track &quot;Polygon Window&quot;. Jez Coad&#x27;s band The Surfing Brides have a track titled &quot;Diceman&quot; (1992) which was also inspired by the book. The At The Gates song &quot;World of Lies&quot; (1995) quotes &quot;The Dice Man&quot; during its spoken word lyrics.

The UK comic, &quot;2000 AD&quot;, published the Gamebook magazine &quot;Dice Man&quot; in 1986. Five editions were created by Pat Mills through October of that year, with script and game by Mills, covers by Glenn Fabry, and art and lettering by various &quot;2000 AD&quot; artists.

The brewers of Rolling Rock beer launched an advertising campaign in the United Kingdom in 1998 based on &quot;The Dice Man&quot;, a campaign that included a short-lived &quot;Dice Life&quot; website.

<text>Off-budget enterprises (OBEs, or [[Special district (United States)|special districts]]) are a type of government in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. OBEs use public funds to further public (as in education) or private (as in economic revitalization) interests. Regulated by various state and federal laws, they operate outside the regulations for general-purpose government and public scrutiny, although many states have created oversight authorities of one form or another. They achieve self-funding by usually having taxation authority or fund themselves through fees for services rendered. Some have the ability to raise revenue bonds. The fastest-growing OBE is the industrial development agency which issues tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds to finance private business ventures mainly to revitalize economically depressed areas. Many are formed to deal with special local situations. The most common OBE is the School district.

In 1962 there were 18,323 OBEs and in 1998 there were nearly 30,000. Some OBEs receive funding from the federal government in the form of block grants.

==Examples==
*Amtrak
*Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
*US Postal Service
*School district
*Port Authority
*United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
*Sovkhoz

==Criticism==
Political scientists Robert E. England and David R. Morgan state, &quot;Through OBEs, Detroit is now dominated by business elites.&quot;
Within the EU, accusations have been made that off-budget enterprises are sometimes used by national governments to circumvent the Stability and Growth Pact, as public debt will no longer appear in the annual budget deficit and in total public debt, which may not exceed certain percentages of GDP (3% and 60% respectively) under the Maastricht criteria. During the past years, there have been various disputes between the European Commission and national governments on the classification of such enterprises.

<doc id="159541" wikidata="Q6685478" url="?curid=159541" title="Lou Diamond">
<text>Leland &quot;Lou&quot; Diamond (May 30, 1890 – September 20, 1951) was a notable member of the United States Marine Corps. He fought in France during World War I, served in China during the interwar period, and fought in the Guadalcanal campaign as a master gunnery sergeant during World War II in the 1st Marine Division, before retiring in 1945.

Diamond was born in Bedford, Ohio, and enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1917. He saw action in World War I with the 6th Marine Regiment, participating in various battles. After the war, he briefly returned to civilian life but re-enlisted in 1921. He served in China and helped design a new infantry pack during the interwar period. In World War II, Diamond was an expert in mortars and made significant contributions to battles on Guadalcanal, receiving a commendation from General Alexander Vandegrift. He was evacuated due to physical disabilities and later became an instructor in the U.S. He retired in 1945 and died in 1951. Diamond&#x27;s legacy includes an episode on the television series Cavalcade of America and being the namesake of Filipino-American actor Lou Diamond Phillips. His decorations include the Navy Commendation Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and various other awards for his service.

==Early years==
Diamond was born in Bedford, Ohio. His parents, Herbert Caleb Diamond (1864–1932) and Mima Ellenor (1866–1921), were Canadians from Belleville, Ontario. His father, of Jewish ancestry, was the youngest of the famed Diamond Brothers of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP), who served in the Red Deer District of Alberta in the 1880s. He is descended from the Hudson River Valley Algonquin-Mohican Diamond family of the pre-American-Revolution era. His ancestors were United Empire Loyalists John Diamond (1759–1845) and Christiana Loyst (1765–1842), from Dutchess County, New York, who fled to Fredericksburgh, Ontario, after the Revolution.

Diamond was a member and frequent visitor to the Toledo, Ohio Jewish Serviceman&#x27;s USO Club sponsored by the National Jewish Welfare Board (NJWB) in 1943, as indicated by his registration card coded as a NON-JEW with a hole punched in the top left hand corner. However, as noted by journalist Marc Parrott, who was present at Diamond&#x27;s funeral, Diamond was a practicing Episcopalian.

He enlisted in the Marine Corps in Detroit, Michigan, on July 25, 1917, at the age of 27, listing as his former occupation &quot;railroad switchman&quot;.
He was assigned Marine Service Number 98912.

==World War I==
As a corporal in January 1918, he shipped out from Philadelphia aboard the USS &quot;Von Steuben&quot; bound for Brest, France. He saw action with the famous 6th Marine Regiment in the battles at Chateau Thierry, Belleau Wood, the Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne. Promoted to the grade of Sergeant, he marched to the Rhine with the Army of Occupation. At war&#x27;s end, he returned to the United States and received an honorable discharge.

==Inter-war period==
Railroading, and civilian life in general, did not suit Diamond well, and on September 23, 1921, he re-enlisted in the Marine Corps.

Diamond itched for more action and he soon got it in Shanghai, with Company M, 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment. But the Sino-Japanese conflict, in Diamond&#x27;s opinion, was &quot;not much of a war,&quot; and on June 10, 1933, he returned to the United States, disembarking from the USS &quot;Henderson&quot; (AP-1) at Mare Island, California. By then he was a gunnery sergeant.

Diamond returned to Shanghai with his old unit, the 4th Marines, ten months later, and then was transferred to the 2nd Marines in December 1934. He returned to the U.S. in February 1937. Two years after his promotion to master gunnery sergeant on July 
10, 1939, he was assigned to the Depot of Supplies at Philadelphia to help design a new infantry pack.

==World War II==
Following the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, Diamond shipped out to Guadalcanal with Company H, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division, arriving at the beaches on August 7, 1942. He was then 52 years old.

Though not a &quot;spit-and-polish&quot; Marine, Diamond proved himself an expert with both 60- and 81-mm mortars, his accurate fire being credited as the turning point of many battles on Guadalcanal. Among the many fables concerning his Guadalcanal service is the tale that he lobbed a mortar shell down the smoke stack of an off-shore Japanese cruiser. It is considered a fact, however, that he drove the cruiser from the bay with his harassing &quot;near-misses.&quot;

General Alexander Vandegrift, Commander of the 1st Marine Division, and later Commandant of the Marine Corps, wrote a letter of commendation that states in part:

After two months on Guadalcanal, physical disabilities dictated his evacuation by air against his wishes. He was moved to the New Hebrides and later to a hospital in New Zealand, where he somehow acquired orders to board a supply ship for New Caledonia. There a friend ordered him back to Guadalcanal – the supposed location of his old outfit. Upon his arrival, however, Diamond discovered that the 1st Marine Division had shipped out to Australia, a distance of over . Diamond made the trip, without orders, by bumming rides on planes, ships and trains.

But Diamond was not destined to see any more combat. On July 1, 1943, he disembarked from the USS &quot;Hermitage&quot; (AP-54) at San Pedro, California, and twelve days later was made an instructor at the MCRD Parris Island, South Carolina. He was transferred to Camp Lejeune on June 15, 1945, and joined the 5th Training Battalion with the same duties.

==Retirement==
Diamond retired on November 23, 1945, and returned to his home in Toledo, Ohio.

==Death==
His death at the Great Lakes, Illinois Naval Training Center Hospital on September 20, 1951, was followed by a funeral with full military honors at Sylvania, Ohio. Diamond was laid to rest at Toledo Memorial Park in Sylvania.

==Legacy==
Actor Ward Bond portrayed Diamond in an episode of the television
series &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; entitled &quot;The Marine Who Lived 200 Years.&quot;
It aired on June 1, 1955; a copy has been located at the Marine Corps Museum.

The Filipino-American actor Lou Diamond Phillips was named after him by his father, a Marine Corps C-130 Crew Chief.

Although Diamond is sometimes referred to as &quot;highly decorated&quot;, his only personal decoration was the Secretary of the Navy Commendation Ribbon, which later became the Navy Commendation Medal. Diamond&#x27;s other awards include:

* the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to the First Marine Division for Guadalcanal.
* the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, eight awards, representing 24 years service.
* the World War I Victory Medal, with four campaign stars (Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel, Meuse-Argonne, and Defensive Sector), for service with the 6th Marine Regiment.
* the Army of Occupation of Germany Medal, for service in the Rhineland in 1919.
* the Yangtze Service Medal, for service in China in 1927–32.
* the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, for service in China 1934–37.
* the American Defense Service Medal, for service 1939–1941.
* the American Campaign Medal, for service in the United States 1943–1945.
* the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal, with two campaign stars (Guadalcanal-Tulagi Landings and Capture and Defense of Guadalcanal), for service with the 2nd Battalion 5th Marine Regiment.
* the World War II Victory Medal.

Diamond was also entitled to the French Fourragère (Croix de Guerre 1914–1918) as a personal award, since he had participated in earning it with the 6th Marines.

<text>A balaclava, also called a ski mask, is a form of cloth headgear designed to expose only part of the face, usually the eyes and mouth. Depending on style and how it is worn, only the eyes, mouth and nose, or just the front of the face are unprotected. Versions with enough of a full face opening may be rolled into a hat to cover the crown of the head or folded down as a collar around the neck. It is commonly used in alpine skiing and snowboarding.

==History==
Similar styles of headgear were known in the 19th century as the &quot;Uhlan cap&quot; worn by Polish and Prussian soldiers, and the &quot;Templar cap&quot; worn by outdoor sports enthusiasts.

The name comes from their use at the 1854 Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War, referring to the town near Sevastopol in Crimea, where British troops there wore knitted headgear to keep warm. Handmade balaclavas were sent over to the British troops to help protect them from the bitter cold weather. British troops required this aid, as their own supplies (warm clothing, weatherproof quarters, and food) never arrived in time. According to Richard Rutt in his &quot;History of Handknitting&quot;, the name &quot;balaclava helmet&quot; was not used during the war but appears much later, in 1881.

==Uses==
===Warmth===
Thin Balaclavas can be used under motorcycle, snowmobile, ski, and snowboard helmets for warmth in cool or winter conditions.

===Sports===
Many skiers, snowboarders, cyclists, and runners wear balaclavas in cold weather for warmth. They protect the head, face, and neck from wind and low temperatures and can fit easily under helmets. These sports balaclavas can be full balaclavas, which cover the entire head leaving only the eyes uncovered, or half-balaclavas, which leave the forehead free, but cover most of the head. Key elements of sports balaclavas are that they are warm, windproof, and moisture-wicking.

===Racing===
Race drivers in Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile sanctioned events must wear balaclavas made of fire-retardant material underneath their crash helmets. In racing events, hill-climbs, special stages of rallies and selective sections of cross-country events entered on the International Sporting Calendar, all drivers and co-drivers must wear overalls as well as gloves (optional for co-drivers), long underwear, a balaclava, and shoes homologated to the FIA 8856-2000 standard.

===Concealment===
Balaclavas are in certain contexts associated with criminality as gang members have used them to conceal their identity. In 2004, police in Prestwich, England, began demanding that people on the street remove their balaclavas, describing the garment as &quot;extremely threatening&quot;. In 2008, police in Kent confiscated a copy of the &quot;War on Terror&quot; board game partly because of the inclusion of a balaclava, stating that it &quot;could be used to conceal someone&#x27;s identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act.&quot;

===Military and police===
In South Asia, balaclavas are commonly referred to as monkey caps because of their typical earth tone colours, and the fact that they blot out most human facial features. Monkey caps sometimes have a small, decorative, woollen pom-pom on top. They are commonly worn by troops on Himalayan duty for protection from the cold.

In December 2006, the United States Marine Corps began issuing balaclavas with hinged face guards as part of the Flame Resistant Organizational Gear program.

In the Soviet Union, the balaclava became a part of standard OMON (special police task force) uniform as early as the Perestroyka years of the late 1980s. The original intent was to protect the identity of the officers to avoid intimidation from Russian organized crime. Because of increased problems with organized crime of the 1990s, TV shots of armed men in black balaclavas became common. Armed Russian police commonly conduct raids and searches of white-collar premises (typically in Moscow) while wearing balaclavas. Such raids have therefore come to be known in Russia as &quot;maski shows&quot;, an allusion to a popular comic TV show of the 1990s.

Balaclavas are often used by police battling drug cartels and gangs in Latin America to conceal their identity and protect their families.

=== Fashion ===
Knitted balaclavas were featured in some collections at the 2018 New York Fashion Week.

<doc id="159547" wikidata="Q170576" url="?curid=159547" title="Milla Jovovich">
<text>Milica Bogdanovna Jovović ( ; born December 17, 1975), known professionally as Milla Jovovich (), is an American actress and former fashion model. Her starring roles in numerous science-fiction and action films led the music channel VH1 to deem her the &quot;reigning queen of kick-butt&quot; in 2006. In 2004, &quot;Forbes&quot; determined that she was the highest-paid model in the world.

Born in Kiev and raised in Los Angeles, Jovovich began modeling when Herb Ritts photographed her for the cover of the Italian magazine &quot;Lei&quot; in 1987. Richard Avedon featured her in Revlon&#x27;s &quot;Most Unforgettable Women in the World&quot; advertisements. In 1988, she made her screen debut in the television film &quot;The Night Train to Kathmandu&quot; and appeared in her first feature film, &quot;Two Moon Junction&quot;.

Jovovich gained attention for her role in the 1991 romance film &quot;Return to the Blue Lagoon&quot;. She was considered to have a breakthrough with her role in the 1997 French science-fiction action film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, written and directed by Luc Besson. Jovovich and Besson married that year but soon divorced. She starred as Joan of Arc in Besson&#x27;s &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; (1999). From 2002 to 2016, she portrayed Alice in the action horror film franchise &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, which became the highest-grossing film series to be based on video games.

Jovovich released her debut album, &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, in 1994, and a follow-up, &quot;The People Tree Sessions&quot;, in 1998. She continues to release demos for other songs on her official website and frequently contributes to film soundtracks. In 2003, she co-created the clothing line Jovovich–Hawk—which ran until 2008—with model Carmen Hawk.

==Early life and family==
Jovovich was born on December 17, 1975, in Kiev in what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the daughter of Galina (), a Russian actress, and Bogdan Jovović, a Serbian doctor. Her maternal ancestors were from Tula. She spent most of her early childhood in Moscow, her mother&#x27;s native city. Jovovich has stated that she was born in Ukraine &quot;pretty much by accident&quot;, while she has no memories of her early years there. However, Jovovich &quot;remembers a lot&quot; about her life in Russia.

In 1980, she immigrated with her family to London and then Sacramento, California before settling in Los Angeles seven months later. Jovovich&#x27;s parents divorced soon after their arrival. In 1988, her father had a relationship with an Argentine woman, with whom he had a son. Due to her parents&#x27; divorce years before, Jovovich saw little of her half brother.

In Los Angeles, her mother tried to get acting jobs but found little success because of language barriers, and eventually resorted to cleaning houses to earn money. Both of Jovovich&#x27;s parents served as cooks and housekeepers for director Brian De Palma. Her father was convicted and imprisoned for participating in the largest health-insurance fraud ever investigated. He was given a 20-year sentence in 1994 but was released in 1999. Jovovich has stated, &quot;Prison was good for him. He&#x27;s become a much better person. It gave him a chance to stop and think.&quot;

She attended public schools in Los Angeles, becoming fluent in English in three months. She was teased by classmates for coming from the Soviet Union. Jovovich has stated, &quot;I was called a commie and a Russian spy. I was [never] accepted into the crowd.&quot; At age 12, she left seventh grade to focus on modeling, which she had started at age nine. According to Jovovich, she was rebellious during her early teens, engaging in drug use, shopping-mall vandalism, and credit-card fraud. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994.

==Career==
===Early roles and hiatus (1985–1996)===
Jovovich&#x27;s mother had &quot;raised her to be a movie star.&quot; In 1985, Loginova enrolled Jovovich at the age of ten in acting classes, and when her acting jobs picked up, she started attending school for young actors rather than regular school. In 1988, Jovovich appeared in her debut professional film role as Samantha Delongpre in the romantic thriller &quot;Two Moon Junction&quot;. Later that year, she appeared in the made-for-television film as Lily McLeod in &quot;The Night Train to Kathmandu.&quot; She had several roles in television series, including &quot;Paradise&quot; (1988), &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (1989), and &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot; (1990).

At age 15, she was cast as the lead in &quot;Return to the Blue Lagoon&quot; (1991), opposite Brian Krause. Given her age and beauty, she was often compared to Brooke Shields, another child model-turned-actress, who had starred in &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; (1980). The role was controversial as, like Shields, Jovovich appeared nude in the film. Jovovich was nominated for &quot;Best Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture&quot; at the 1991 Young Artist Awards, and &quot;Worst New Star&quot; at the 1991 Golden Raspberry Awards. In 1992, Jovovich co-starred with Christian Slater in the comedy &quot;Kuffs&quot;. Later that year, she portrayed Mildred Harris in the Charlie Chaplin biographical film &quot;Chaplin&quot;. In 1993, she acted in Richard Linklater&#x27;s satiric film &quot;Dazed and Confused.&quot; She played Michelle Burroughs, the on-screen girlfriend to Pickford (played by her then-boyfriend Shawn Andrews). Strongly featured in promotions for the film, Jovovich was upset to find her role much reduced in the released film. Discouraged, she took a hiatus from acting roles, moving to Europe.

===Breakthrough (1997–2001)===

Jovovich returned to acting in 1997 with a lead role in the French science-fiction action film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, alongside Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman. This was written and directed by Luc Besson. She portrayed Leeloo, an alien who helps to save the planet. Jovovich said she &quot;worked like hell: no band practice, no clubs, no pot, nothing&quot; to acquire the role and impress Besson. Jovovich co-created and mastered an alien fictional language of over 400 words for her role. She wore a costume that came to be known as the &quot;ACE-bandage&quot; costume; the body suit designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier was made of medical bandages. &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was selected as the opening film for the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, and its worldwide box office gross was over $263 million, more than three times its budget of $80 million. &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was often praised for its visual style; critic James Berardinelli wrote, &quot;Jovovich makes an impression, although her effectiveness has little to do with acting and less to do with dialogue&quot;. Jovovich was nominated for &quot;Favorite Female Newcomer&quot; at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards and &quot;Best Fight&quot; at the MTV Movie Awards. The film inspired a video game and a planned Leeloo action figure, but the figure was never released due to licensing problems. In a 2003 interview, Jovovich said Leeloo was her favorite role.

In 1998, Jovovich appeared in Spike Lee&#x27;s drama &quot;He Got Game,&quot; as abused prostitute Dakota Burns; she acted with Denzel Washington and Ray Allen. In 1999, she appeared in the music video for the song &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Say No&quot; by Lenny Kravitz. That year she returned to the action genre playing the title role in &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot;, under direction of Luc Besson. She cut her hair short and wore armour in several extensive battle scenes. Jovovich received generally good reviews for her performance. The historical drama did moderately well at the box office, gaining $66 million worldwide. In 2000, Jovovich appeared as the troubled Eloise in &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot;, a film based on a concept story by Bono of the band U2 and Nicholas Klein. Directed by Wim Wenders, Jovovich starred alongside Jeremy Davies and Mel Gibson; she provided vocals on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. That year she also played bar owner Lucia, in the British western film &quot;The Claim&quot; (2000). This was followed by a supporting role as the evil Katinka in the comedy &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001).

===International success (2002–2009)===

In 2002, Jovovich starred in the horror-action film &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, released in the United States on March 15, 2002, and based on the Capcom video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film&#x27;s heroine, who fights a legion of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise. Jovovich had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training, and had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous. The film was commercially successful, grossing US$17 million on its opening weekend; it eventually made US$40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide. Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in &quot;No Good Deed&quot; (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy &quot;You Stupid Man&quot; (2002), punk rocker Fangora (&quot;Fanny&quot;) in &quot;Dummy&quot; (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. The role of Fangora in &quot;Dummy&quot; allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy to identify with this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress&#x27; own life.

In 2004, Jovovich reprised the role of Alice in the sequel to &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;. The role required her to do fight training for three hours a day, in addition to the three months prior to filming in which she had &quot;gun training, martial arts, everything&quot;. &quot;Apocalypse&quot; received even more negative reactions from the critics than the first film, but it was an even greater commercial success, ranking number one at the box office. Following the release of the film, Jovovich was unhappy with the critical results and director Alexander Witt&#x27;s effort. She noted during an interview that year that her large action films take care of the commercial part of her career, while she acts in &quot;independent little films that never come out&quot; to appease her artistic side, and &quot;It&#x27;s a good balance&quot;. The following year, she was featured in Gore Vidal&#x27;s faux trailer remake of &quot;Caligula&quot;, as Drusilla. In 2006, Jovovich&#x27;s film, the science fiction/action thriller &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, was released on March 3. She played the title role of Violet Song jat Shariff, a role that also involved heavily choreographed fight sequences. It was not screened for critics, but when reviewed, it was critically panned and failed at the box office, grossing US$31 million worldwide. Also in 2006, Jovovich starred in the independent thriller &quot;.45&quot;, with Scottish actor Angus Macfadyen.

In 2007, Jovovich reprised her role as Alice in &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;, the third of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series. The film grossed an estimated $24 million on its opening weekend, topping the box-office gross for that week. In 2009, Jovovich starred in David Twohy&#x27;s &quot;A Perfect Getaway&quot; with Kiele Sanchez, Timothy Olyphant, and Steve Zahn. The film is a thriller about a newlywed couple (Milla and Zahn) on their honeymoon in Hawaii. Reviews for the film were mostly positive; while &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt that Jovovich gave a &quot;fairly subtle performance&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted that she and &quot;[...]Kiele Sanchez manage to bring some dramatic tension to the frightened-girlfriend moments&quot;. &quot;A Perfect Getaway&quot; garnered modest box office returns. Jovovich starred in the science-fiction thriller &quot;The Fourth Kind&quot;, as a psychologist in Alaska who uses hypnosis to uncover memories from her patients of alien abduction. While the film was largely panned by critics, it made US$47.71 million in cinemas worldwide.

===Recent works (2010–present)===
In 2010, Jovovich returned as Alice in the fourth movie of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series, &quot;Afterlife&quot;, which was directed by her husband, Paul W. S. Anderson, and portrayed the mother of a promiscuous and troubled high school student in the independent coming-of-age dramedy &quot;Dirty Girl&quot;, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, opposite Juno Temple, William H. Macy, Mary Steenburgen, and Tim McGraw. In its review for the latter film, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; found Jovovich to be &quot;terrific&quot; in what it described as a &quot;sweet [and] sassy period comedy with a &quot;Juno&quot; sensibility and the soul of a &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;&quot;. Jovovich played the wife of a jailed arsonist in &quot;Stone&quot;, a psychological thriller co-starring Robert De Niro and Edward Norton. Filming began in May 2009 at the recently closed Southern Michigan Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan. The film was released in late 2010 to a mixed response. Nevertheless, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted that Jovovich was &quot;particularly good as a breathy femme fatale who seduces De Niro with a mere change in inflection&quot;.

Jovovich starred in Paul W. S. Anderson&#x27;s romantic action adventure film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, as Milady de Winter, in 2011, alongside Matthew Macfadyen, Logan Lerman, Ray Stevenson, Luke Evans, Orlando Bloom, and Christoph Waltz. After the lackluster response for &quot;Musketeers&quot;, Jovovich criticised Summit Entertainment for not &quot;promoting [the film] properly&quot; as a &quot;family film&quot; in the United States. &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Summit responded: &quot;She doesn&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s talking about and we don&#x27;t know where she&#x27;s coming from.&quot; She would next headline the little-seen psychological thriller &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot;, which was written and directed by Julien Magnat; in it, she plays the survivor of a serial killer&#x27;s attack that leaves her suffering from a condition called prosopagnosia, which renders her unable to recognize faces. &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; remarked that the film suffered from &quot;a central performance not quite strong enough to win Jovovich recognition as a dramatic actress&quot;. Also in 2011, Jovovich appeared as a Ukrainian con artist in Famke Janssen&#x27;s directorial debut film &quot;Bringing Up Bobby&quot;, alongside Marcia Cross, and starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Lucky Trouble&quot;, which was her Russian-language film debut.
Jovovich returned to her role as Alice in the fifth installment of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; for &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot; (2012). She played an ambitious woman and the second wife of the leader of a motorcycle club in 2014&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, a film version of the eponymous play by William Shakespeare, and in 2015&#x27;s &quot;Survivor&quot;, she took on the role of a Diplomatic Security Service/Foreign Service officer at the US Embassy in London. Both films received a
video on demand release in North America, despite theatrical runs abroad. Jovovich made a cameo appearance reprising the role of villain Katinka in 2016&#x27;s &quot;Zoolander 2&quot;. &quot;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&quot; (2016), the sixth and final film of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise, starred Jovovich as Alice as she continues her vengeance against Umbrella for the death of her allies and the catastrophe they have caused. &quot;Time Out&quot; in its review for the film noted: &quot;While the franchise has slackened into dependably dumb post-apocalyptic thrills, star Milla Jovovich has only gotten better, seasoning her long-legged athleticism with a commanding stare&quot;. &quot;The Final Chapter&quot; was the highest-grossing film in the franchise, earning over US$312 million worldwide.

In &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; (2017), Jovovich played the wife of an investigator working on the reasons behind the Bush Administration&#x27;s 2003 invasion of Iraq, starring opposite Woody Harrelson and Tommy Lee Jones. In &quot;Future World&quot; (2018), she obtained the role of a drug lord, alongside James Franco, who also directed the film. While reviewers felt Jovovich was &quot;underused&quot; in &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;, &quot;Future World&quot; holds a 0% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews. Jovovich starred as the administrator of an island-bound reform school in the fantasy film &quot;Paradise Hills&quot; (2019), the directorial debut of Alice Waddington. She also played the evil Vivienne Nimue, the Blood Queen in the &quot;Hellboy&quot; reboot movie, released in 2019.

Jovovich is the co-founder and owner of the production company Creature Entertainment.

==Other endeavors==
===Music===
Jovovich had begun working on a music album as early as 1988, when she was signed by SBK Records after the company heard a demo she recorded. In August 1990, she asserted in an interview that the then-forthcoming album would be &quot;a mix between Kate Bush, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, This Mortal Coil, and the Cocteau Twins.&quot; After it was initially presented by SBK strictly as a pop album, Jovovich protested, insisting on using her personal poetry for lyrics and recording her own instrumental material. Jovovich had written the lyrics and composed the music of the songs when she was fifteen, except a cover of a Ukrainian folk song, &quot;In a Glade&quot;. In April 1994, billed under her first name, she released &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, a title that was a reference to the epic poem by Dante Alighieri of the same name. Jovovich had chosen the title after seeing Russian artist Alexis Steele&#x27;s proposed cover artwork sketch for the then untitled album. Jovovich found that the sketch had &quot;all the struggle that I&#x27;m singing about. It is the divine comedy.&quot; &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; was well received by critics, and features pop-infused traditional Ukrainian folk songs that led to comparisons with Tori Amos and Kate Bush. John McAlley of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;remarkable&quot;, &quot;strikingly mature and rich in invention&quot;, and as featuring &quot;angst-laced poetry with vivid melodies and arrangements that find a common spirit in synth pop, European folk and psychedelic dream rock&quot;.

Jovovich released the track &quot;The Gentleman Who Fell (Before The Court)&quot;, with an accompanying music video, as the sole single from the album. The music video was originally directed by Lisa Bonet and featured Harry Dean Stanton, but Jovovich, unsatisfied with the results, decided to film another video. The second video for &quot;The Gentleman Who Fell&quot;, a homage to Maya Deren, was directed by Kate Garner and Paul Archard and was subsequently played on MTV. Jovovich toured the United States and Canada during most of 1994 to promote the album, opening for Toad the Wet Sprocket, The Philosopher Kings, and Crash Test Dummies, as well as playing smaller acoustic sets. Jovovich had opted to perform in smaller and more intimate settings, turning down a musical appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; Jovovich has also been collaborating musically with longtime friend and musician Chris Brenner, who co-wrote with her on the Divine Comedy Album and who was the musical coordinator for the supporting tour. She and Brenner met in 1993 and have since worked together on several ventures. Following &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, she expressed interest in releasing a second album, having had ten songs ready for a future recording that was intended for a mid-1996 release.

In May 1999, Jovovich, along with Chris Brenner, formed an experimental band called &quot;Plastic Has Memory&quot;, in which she wrote and composed the songs, sang, and played electric guitar. The band was &quot;[m]uch heavier and darker than the vaguely Ukrainian folk-sounding elements of her first album&quot;, and it had a similar sound to a grunge and trip hop Portishead. &quot;Plastic Has Memory&quot; played about a dozen shows in Los Angeles and New York City for a potential Virgin Records album release, one of which Mick Jagger had attended. But though &quot;Plastic Has Memory&quot; was featured on &quot;Hollywood Goes Wild!&quot;, a benefit celebrity compilation album, the group never formally released any albums, and had disbanded as of 2021.

Jovovich has contributed tracks to soundtracks of several of her own films, including &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; (2000) and &quot;Dummy&quot; (2002), and for others films such as &quot;Underworld&quot; (2003) produced by musician Danny Lohner, who was the bass player in Nine Inch Nails for many years. Her song &quot;The Gentlemen Who Fell&quot; is on &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; soundtrack of 2002. In 2001, Jovovich joined many celebrities whose vocals were featured in a cover of &quot;We are Family&quot; to raise money for the American Red Cross. She has appeared as guest vocalist on the song &quot;Former Lover&quot; on Deepak Chopra&#x27;s album, &quot;A Gift of Love II: Oceans of Ecstasy&quot; (2002) and &quot;Legion of Boom&quot; (2004) by The Crystal Method.

Beginning in 2003, Jovovich worked with musician Maynard James Keenan, of Tool and A Perfect Circle, on his Industrial side project Puscifer, contributing vocals to the track &quot;REV 22:20&quot;, which was featured on various film soundtracks in its original or a remixed form. In January 2009, she collaborated with Maynard and Danny Lohner on the Puscifer track called, &quot;The Mission&quot;. She performed the song at the first live Puscifer performance on February 13, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Danny Lohner, and longtime music collaborator Chris Brenner record and perform with Jovovich, who has made several highly praised appearances.

A new single called &quot;Electric Sky&quot; was released on May 18, 2012, and presented at the Life Ball. In 2017, she collaborated in the single &quot;Attention of Ernest Shalubin&quot;. Jovovich writes songs which she refers to as &quot;demos&quot;, freely downloadable from her website with license to remix the tracks and reserved right to sell and issue them.

===Modeling===
Jovovich&#x27;s early work with Herb Ritts, Richard Avedon, and Peter Lindbergh led to her success in advertising, bringing the young model contracts. Since then, she has been featured on more than 100 magazine covers, including &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and &quot;GQ&quot;.

She has walked for Balmain, Versace, Fendi, Trussardi, Alessandro Dell&#x27;Acqua, Costume National, Iceberg, Anna Sui, Dries van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester, Marc Jacobs, Miu Miu, Salvatore Ferragamo, Missoni, Blumarine, Jil Sander, and Jean Paul Gautier. She has been part of campaigns for Banana Republic, Christian Dior, Jimmy Choo, Prada, Isabel Marant, Celine, Guess?, Chanel, Tommy Hilfiger, Tiffany &amp; Co., Roberto Cavalli, Damiani, Donna Karan, Gap, Versace, Calvin Klein, DKNY, Coach, Giorgio Armani, H&amp;M, and Revlon. Since 1998, Jovovich has been an &quot;international spokesmodel&quot; for L&#x27;Oréal cosmetics. She was referred to in a minor cameo in Bret Easton Ellis&#x27;s novel &quot;Glamorama&quot;, a satire of society&#x27;s obsession with celebrities and beauty.

Jovovich was said to be designer Miuccia Prada&#x27;s muse in 2002; a 2003 article claimed she was Gianni Versace&#x27;s &quot;favourite supermodel&quot;. In 2004, Jovovich topped &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Richest Supermodels of the World&quot; list, earning a reported $10.5 million, and in 2006, Jovovich was picked up by Mango, a Spanish clothing line, as their new spokesmodel and is featured in their advertising campaigns; she is in advertisements for Etro. She has said that &quot;Modeling was never a priority&quot; and that the money she earns enables her &quot;to be selective about the creative decisions [she] make[s]&quot;.

In 2012, Jovovich was hired as the new &quot;face&quot; of a global advertising campaign for wristwatch and jewelry retailer Jacob &amp; Co. In 2018, Jovovich became the &quot;face&quot; of a global advertising campaign for Balmain.

In 2019, Jovovich joined more than one hundred models who signed a petition to help protect Victoria&#x27;s Secret models against sexual misconduct.

===Fashion design===
Jovovich and fellow model Carmen Hawk launched a line of clothing called Jovovich–Hawk in 2003. The pair opened a showroom in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village on September 13, 2005. All of the dresses for Jovovich-Hawk line were designed by herself and her partner Carmen Hawk. The atelier is based in Los Angeles, but pieces were at Fred Segal in Los Angeles, Harvey Nichols, and over 50 stores around the world. &quot;Vogue&quot; praised the line for its &quot;girl-about-town cult status most designers spend years trying to achieve&quot;. In November 2006, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and &quot;US Vogue&quot; nominated Jovovich-Hawk for the CFDA/&quot;Vogue&quot; Fashion Fund Award. Jovovich-Hawk was nominated as a finalist, although Doo-Ri Chung took the top prize. In 2007, Jovovich and Hawk designed the costume for Jovovich&#x27;s character Alice in &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;. Alice&#x27;s shorts are a variation on the &quot;Alice Star&quot; Shorts from the Spring 2007 collection. Later, Jovovich-Hawk signed a deal to design a diffusion collection for Target&#x27;s Go International campaign, following in the footsteps of Luella, Paul &amp; Joe, and Proenza Schouler. In late 2008, Jovovich and Hawk mutually agreed to end the business due to increased demands on their time. Jovovich explained, &quot;I&#x27;m an artist. I&#x27;m not someone who can deal with shipping rates and taxes&quot;.

==Public image==

Jovovich has been noted for her careers as a model, singer, and actress. Music channel VH1 has referred to her as the &quot;reigning queen of kick-butt&quot; for her roles in various sci-fi and action films and Rebecca Flint Marx of Allmovie said that despite the negative critical response for the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films, the franchise has turned Jovovich into an &quot;A-list action star&quot;. Her action roles have given her a geek following for which MTV said she was &quot;Every Geek&#x27;s Dream Girl&quot;.

In 2004, Jovovich was ranked No.69 on &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Hot List&quot;, ranked No. 82 in 2005 and ranked No. 21 in 2010. &quot;Maxim&quot; also named her No. 11 on their list of &quot;Hottest Nerd Crushes&quot;. In 2008, she was ranked No. 90 on Ask Men&#x27;s Top 99 Women of 2008 List.
In 2011, Jovovich attended and sang at the birthday celebration of Mikhail Gorbachev. She gave a speech thanking Gorbachev, saying that when she and her family left the Soviet Union in 1980, they were sure that they would never see their relatives again but they have been reunited.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Jovovich married on-screen boyfriend Shawn Andrews in 1992 while filming &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. Andrews was 21 and Jovovich was 16; the marriage was annulled by her mother two months later. Shortly after the annulment, Jovovich moved to Europe with her friend and musician Chris Brenner where she met and lived with her new boyfriend, ex-Jamiroquai bassist Stuart Zender, in London from May 1994 to October 1995. She married &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; director Luc Besson in 1997 in Las Vegas where they went skydiving directly after the ceremony. They divorced in 1999. In 2000, she briefly dated Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante saying she fell in love with him after hearing his album &quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; six years earlier. Between 1998 and 2001, she befriended the young poet and musician Anno Birkin, as mutual inspiration behind many of their compositions. Jovovich became romantically involved with Birkin just before his death in a car accident on November 8, 2001.

Jovovich met film writer and director Paul W. S. Anderson while working on the 2002 film &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, which Anderson wrote and directed, and in which Jovovich starred. Anderson proposed to Jovovich in 2003, and the two were &quot;engaged on-and-off for four years&quot; before becoming a couple again early in 2007. They married on August 22, 2009. On November 3, 2007, Jovovich gave birth to their first child, daughter Ever Anderson, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. Their second child, daughter Dashiel Edan, was born on April 1, 2015, also at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. In 2019, Jovovich revealed she was pregnant with her third daughter after miscarrying two years prior. She gave birth to their third daughter, Osian Lark Elliot, on February 2, 2020. Jovovich resides in Los Angeles and New York City.

===Lifestyle===
She speaks Russian, English, French, and Serbian. She was brought up in a Russian household and referred to the role of Russian culture in her life when she stated in 2005:
When asked if she still feels Russian after having left Russia at a young age, Jovovich replied, &quot;Definitely. I still speak Russian. I speak it with my daughter. I read her Russian stories and poems. My roots are very important—they make me who I am&quot;. Speaking about her early years, Milla noted the importance of education in her life, &quot;...my mom raised me in the traditions of her country. For example, I never spent hours sitting before a TV and always read a lot. And I believe that education, intellect and intelligence are a huge part of the beauty of Russian women.&quot;

Jovovich has advocated the legalization of cannabis and appeared in a spread and on the cover for &quot;High Times&quot;. In an article published in 1994, she said that her only vices were cigarettes and cannabis. She practices yoga and meditates often to live a healthy lifestyle. Unaffiliated with any specific religion, she prays and considers herself a &quot;spiritual person&quot;. Jovovich enjoys playing the guitar and writing poems and lyrics for songs.

===Political views===
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is part of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Jovovich expressed support for Ukraine on her Instagram page: &quot;I am heartbroken and dumbstruck trying to process the events of this week in my birthplace of Ukraine. My country and people being bombed. Friends and family in hiding&quot;.

In October 2023, Jovovich was a signatory to the Artists4Ceasefire open letter to President Joe Biden, calling for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war.

<text>Sir George Iain Duncan Smith (born 9 April 1954), often referred to by his initials IDS, is a British politician who was Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition from 2001 to 2003. He was Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from 2010 to 2016. He has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Chingford and Woodford Green, formerly Chingford, since 1992.

The son of W. G. G. Duncan Smith, a Royal Air Force flying ace, Duncan Smith was born in Edinburgh and raised in Solihull. After education at the training school and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he served in the Scots Guards from 1975 to 1981, seeing tours in Northern Ireland and Rhodesia. He joined the Conservative Party in 1981. After unsuccessfully contesting Bradford West in 1987, he was elected to Parliament at the 1992 general election. He was a backbencher during the premiership of John Major. During the leadership of William Hague he was Shadow Secretary of State for Social Security between 1997 and 1998, and Shadow Secretary of State for Defence from 1998 to 2001.

Following the resignation of William Hague, Duncan Smith won the 2001 Conservative leadership election, partly owing to the support of Margaret Thatcher for his Eurosceptic beliefs. However, many Conservative MPs came to consider him incapable of winning the next general election and, in 2003, he lost a vote of confidence in his leadership; he immediately resigned and was succeeded by Michael Howard. Returning to the backbenches, Duncan Smith founded the Centre for Social Justice, a centre-right think tank independent of the Conservative Party, and became chair of its Social Justice Policy Group.

In May 2010, new Prime Minister David Cameron appointed him to serve in the cabinet as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. During his tenure, he was responsible for seeing through changes to the welfare state. He resigned from the cabinet in March 2016, in opposition to Chancellor George Osborne&#x27;s proposed cuts to disability benefits, returning to the backbenches, where he remains.

== Early life, military service and professional career ==
Duncan Smith was born George Ian Duncan Smith on 9 April 1954 in Edinburgh. A second &quot;i&quot; was added to his middle name &quot;Ian&quot; later in life, with several explanations given: Duncan Smith changed it himself to prove that he was committed to Scotland; the person who filled in his birth certificate made a mistake; Duncan Smith&#x27;s mother registered him, but Duncan Smith&#x27;s patriotic father later suggested to his son to change it to the Scottish spelling.

He is the son of Wilfrid George Gerald &quot;W. G. G.&quot; Duncan Smith, a decorated Royal Air Force flying ace of the Second World War, and Pamela Summers, a ballerina. His parents married in 1946.

One of his maternal great-grandmothers was Ellen Oshey Matsumuro, a Japanese woman living in Beijing who married Pamela&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Irish merchant seaman Captain Samuel Lewis Shaw. Through Ellen and Samuel, Duncan Smith is related to Canadian CBC wartime broadcaster Peter Stursberg (whose book &quot;No Foreign Bones in China&quot; records their story) and his son, former CBC vice-president Richard Stursberg.

Duncan Smith was educated at Bishop Glancey Secondary Modern School, until the age of 14, and then at , a merchant navy training school on the Isle of Anglesey, until he was 18. There, he played rugby union in the position of fly-half alongside Clive Woodward at centre.

In 1973, he spent a year studying at the University for Foreigners in Perugia, Italy, but did not complete his studies and did not gain any qualifications. He then attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Scots Guards as a second lieutenant on 28 June 1975, with the service number 500263. He was promoted to lieutenant in the Scots Guards on 28 June 1977. During his service, he served in Northern Ireland and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where he was aide-de-camp to Major-General Sir John Acland, commander of the Commonwealth Monitoring Force monitoring the ceasefire during elections.

Duncan Smith worked for GEC Marconi in the 1980s and attended short courses at the company&#x27;s staff college in Dunchurch. He did not gain any qualifications at Dunchurch and completed six separate courses lasting a few days each, adding up to roughly a month in total. Nevertheless, until exposed by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme, Smith declared on the Conservative Party website and in his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry, that he had attended the University of Perugia and the &quot;Dunchurch College of Management&quot;.

==Early parliamentary career==
At the 1987 general election Duncan Smith contested the constituency of Bradford West, where the incumbent Labour Party MP Max Madden retained his seat. At the 1992 general election, Duncan Smith stood in the London constituency of Chingford, a safe Conservative seat, following the retirement of Conservative MP Norman Tebbit. He became a member of the House of Commons with a majority of 14,938. A committed Eurosceptic, he became a constant thorn in the side of Prime Minister John Major&#x27;s government of 1992 to 1997, opposing Major&#x27;s pro-European agenda at the time. This was something that would often be raised during his own subsequent leadership when he called for the party to unite behind him.

Duncan Smith remained on the backbenches until 1997, when the new Conservative leader William Hague brought him into the Shadow cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Social Security, the former version of the Department for Work and Pensions which he would later lead. At the 1997 general election, boundary changes saw his constituency renamed Chingford and Woodford Green and his majority of 14,938 was reduced to 5,714. Duncan Smith realised the dangers that he and neighbouring Conservative MPs faced, so redoubled his efforts: &quot;We spent the final week of the campaign working my seat as if it was [were] a marginal. I held on but everywhere around me went.&quot; In 1999, Duncan Smith replaced John Maples as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence.

==Leader of the Conservative Party==

William Hague resigned after the Labour Party continued in government with another large parliamentary majority following the 2001 general election. In September 2001, Duncan Smith was the successful candidate in the Conservative leadership election. Although he was initially viewed as an outsider, his campaign was bolstered when Margaret Thatcher publicly gave her support for him. His victory in the contest was helped by the fact that his opponent in the final vote of party members was Kenneth Clarke, whose strong support for the European Union was at odds with the views of much of the party.

In the 2002 local elections, the first of two elections in which Duncan Smith led the party, the Conservatives gained 238 extra seats on local councils, primarily in England. The 2002 Conservative Party conference saw an attempt to turn Duncan Smith&#x27;s lack of charisma into a positive attribute, with his much-quoted line, &quot;do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man&quot;.

Amid speculation that rebel MPs were seeking to undermine him, Duncan Smith called on the party to &quot;Unite or die.&quot; On 23 February 2003, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; newspaper published an article saying that 14 MPs were prepared to sign a petition for a vote of confidence in Duncan Smith (25 signatories were then needed) for a vote on his removal as leader. Duncan Smith&#x27;s 2003 conference speech favoured an aggressive hard-man approach which received several ovations from party members in the hall. &quot;The quiet man is here to stay, and he&#x27;s turning up the volume&quot;, Duncan Smith said.

In the 2003 local elections, the Conservatives gained 566 seats. Despite the gains made, Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Crispin Blunt resigned. He called Duncan Smith&#x27;s leadership a &quot;handicap&quot; as he had &quot;failed to make the necessary impact on the electorate&quot;, and said that he should be replaced. These worries came to a head in October 2003 when journalist Michael Crick revealed he had compiled embarrassing evidence of dubious salary claims Duncan Smith made on behalf of his wife that were paid out of the public purse from September 2001 to December 2002. The ensuing scandal, known as &quot;Betsygate&quot;, weakened his already tenuous position.

=== Vote of confidence ===
Following months of speculation over a leadership challenge, Duncan Smith called upon critics within his party to either gather enough support to trigger a vote of confidence in him or get behind him. A vote of confidence was called on Wednesday 29 October 2003, which Duncan Smith lost by 90 votes to 75. He stepped down eight days later on 6 November, with Michael Howard being confirmed as his successor. Duncan Smith became the first Conservative leader who did not lead his party in a general election campaign since Neville Chamberlain.

==Return to the backbenches==
The same week as Michael Howard succeeded him, Duncan Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Tune&quot; was released to negative critical reception. In November 2003, he was appointed by Howard to the Conservative Party&#x27;s advisory council, along with John Major, William Hague and Kenneth Clarke.

In 2004, Duncan Smith established the Centre for Social Justice, a centre-right think tank working with small charities with the aim of finding innovative policies for tackling poverty. On 7 December 2005, he was appointed Chairman of the Social Justice Policy Group, which was facilitated by the Centre for Social Justice. His deputy chair was Debbie Scott, the Chief Executive of the charity Tomorrow&#x27;s People. The group released two major reports, &quot;Breakdown Britain&quot; and &quot;Breakthrough Britain&quot;. &quot;Breakdown Britain&quot; was a 300,000 word document that analysed what was going wrong in the areas of economic dependence and unemployment, family breakdown, addiction, educational failure, indebtedness, and the voluntary sector. &quot;Breakthrough Britain&quot; recommended almost two hundred policy ideas using broadly the same themes.

Duncan Smith was re-elected comfortably in Chingford and Woodford Green at the 2005 general election, almost doubling his majority, from 5,487 to 10,641. In September 2006, he was one of fourteen authors of a report concerning antisemitism in Britain. He was also one of the only early supporters of the Iraq troop surge policy in 2007.

==Secretary of State for Work and Pensions==

Following the 2010 general election, Duncan Smith was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in the Cameron–Clegg coalition. Under his leadership, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) rolled out Universal Credit and a new Work Programme, as well as implemented a real terms cut in benefits. He also looked at &quot;how to make it harder for sick and disabled people to claim benefits&quot; by giving DWP staff more powers to conduct benefit eligibility tests and to strip benefits from claimants with serious but time-limited health conditions. Duncan Smith was advised it would be illegal to introduce legislation not requiring parliamentary approval. The DWP was criticised by Oxfam and Justin Welby for rises in food poverty. Duncan Smith himself was criticised by the UK Statistics Authority and National Institute of Economic and Social Research for breaking the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.

=== Cameron–Clegg coalition ===

Shortly after being appointed, Duncan Smith said the government would encourage people to work for longer by making it illegal for companies to force staff to give up work at 65 and bringing forward the planned rises in the state pension age. He announced reforms to simplify benefits and tax credits into a single Universal Credit payment, arguing welfare reform would make low earners better off in employment. He promised targeted work activity, sanctions and possible removal of benefits for up to three years for those who refused to work. Benefits claimants with part-time incomes below a certain threshold would become required to search for additional work or risk losing access to their benefits. He said benefits were not a route out of child poverty but hundreds of thousands of children could be lifted out of child poverty if one of their parents were to work at least a 35-hour week at the national minimum wage.

In June 2011, Duncan Smith announced welfare-to-work programmes would be replaced with a single Work Programme, which included incentives for private sector service providers to help the unemployed find long term employment. The DWP announced on the 2012 United Nations&#x27; International Day of Persons with Disabilities that there would be forced work for disabled people who received welfare benefits, in order to &quot;improve disabled people&#x27;s chances of getting work by mandatory employment&quot;. In the 2012 Cabinet reshuffle, Duncan Smith was offered the job at the Ministry of Justice replacing Kenneth Clarke, but declined, and remained in his post at the DWP.

In April 2013, Duncan Smith said he could live on £53 per week as Work and Pensions Secretary, after a benefits claimant told the BBC he had £53 per week after housing costs. Also in April, he called for wealthier people to voluntarily return universal winter fuel payments to help reduce the strain on public finances, prompting some wealthier pensioners to state they had already tried this but had their offers refused because there was no mechanism for returning payments. In September, the DWP cancelled a week of &quot;celebrations&quot; to mark the impact of enhanced benefit sanctions. In the same month, the DWP was subject to an &quot;excoriating&quot; National Audit Office report, accusing the DWP of having &quot;weak management, ineffective control and poor governance&quot; and of wasting £34 million on inadequate computer systems. Duncan Smith dismissed allegations in Matthew d&#x27;Ancona&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;In It Together&quot; that the Chancellor George Osborne had referred to him as &quot;just not clever enough&quot;. The allegations were also denied by Osborne.

In May 2014, it was reported the DWP was employing debt collectors to retrieve overpaid benefits, the overpayment purely down to calculation mistakes by HM Revenue and Customs. After the &quot;workfare&quot; element of the Work Programme was successfully challenged in the courts in 2013, Duncan Smith sought to re-establish the legality of the scheme through retrospective legislation but, in July 2014, the High Court ruled the retrospective nature of the legislation interfered with the &quot;right to a fair trial&quot; under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The DWP had said 1 million people would be placed on the new Universal Credit benefits system by April 2014, yet by October 2014 only 15,000 were assigned to UC. Duncan Smith said a final delivery date would not be set for this, declaring &quot;Arbitrary dates and deadlines are the enemy of secure delivery.&quot;

=== Cameron majority government ===
In August 2015, Duncan Smith was criticised after the DWP admitted publishing fake testimonies of claimants enjoying their benefits cuts. Later the same month, publication of statistics showed 2,380 people died in a 3-year period shortly after a work capability assessment declared them fit for work. This led to Jeremy Corbyn calling for Duncan Smith&#x27;s resignation. At the 2015 Conservative Party conference, Duncan Smith said to the sick and disabled &quot;With our help, you&#x27;ll work your way out of poverty&quot; while criticising the current system, which he said &quot;makes doctors ask a simplistic question: are you too sick to work at all? If the answer is yes, they&#x27;re signed off work – perhaps for ever.&quot;

In March 2016, Duncan Smith unexpectedly resigned from the Cabinet. He stated that he was unable to accept the government&#x27;s planned cuts to disability benefits. He later launched an attack on the &quot;government&#x27;s austerity programme for balancing the books on the backs of the poor and vulnerable&quot;, describing this as divisive and &quot;deeply unfair&quot;, and adding: &quot;It is in danger of drifting in a direction that divides society rather than unites it.&quot;

== Later backbench career ==
 In the 2016 EU membership referendum, Duncan Smith campaigned to leave the EU working with the Vote Leave campaign, stating that staying in the EU &quot;leaves the door open&quot; to the UK enduring terrorist attacks. While he had opposed David Cameron over the referendum, sources close to Duncan Smith said his resignation as Work and Pensions Secretary was not about Europe.

In the 2019 Conservative leadership election, Duncan Smith served as chairman for Boris Johnson&#x27;s leadership campaign, resulting in an emphatic win, with over 50% of MPs and 66% of the Conservative membership voting for Johnson to become the next Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister. He was knighted in the 2020 New Year Honours, for political and public service. The honour sparked criticism, with more than 237,000 people signing an online petition, set up by Labour Party activist Dr Mona Kamal Ahmed, a National Health Service psychiatrist, demanding that it be rescinded.

In June 2020, Duncan Smith launched the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, becoming the co-chair of the alliance in the UK with Labour peer, Helena Kennedy. The alliance seeks to &quot;promote a coordinated response between democratic states to challenges posed by the present conduct and future ambitions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. By developing a common set of principles and frameworks that transcend domestic party divisions and international borders, our democracies will be able to keep the rules-based and human rights systems true to their founding purposes.&quot; In a launch message, Duncan Smith explained, &quot;This challenge will outlast governments and administrations and it transcends party politics.&quot;

On 26 March 2021, it was announced that Duncan Smith was one of five MPs to be sanctioned by the Chinese government for spreading what it called &quot;lies and disinformation&quot; about the country. He was subsequently banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau and Chinese citizens and institutions became prohibited from doing business with him. The sanctions were condemned by the Prime Minister and led the Foreign Secretary to summon the Chinese ambassador.

Following an incident in October 2021 in Manchester outside a Conservative Party Conference where Duncan Smith had a traffic cone put on his head and verbally harangued, in November 2022 a man had one charge of assault dismissed with &quot;no case to answer&quot; and two others were found not guilty of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent.

Following the Liberal Democrats&#x27; victory in the North Shropshire by-election, Duncan Smith stated the government had lost focus due to stories about Downing Street parties where COVID-19 rules were broken. Duncan Smith stated, &quot;The prime minister needs to show really strongly that he doesn&#x27;t just disapprove but is prepared to get rid of people who are breaking those rules.&quot;

In July 2022, Duncan Smith announced his support for Liz Truss in the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election because she had done more than her opponents to &quot;deliver the benefits of Brexit&quot;. Following Truss&#x27;s appointment as leader of the Conservative Party, Duncan Smith called on his colleagues to &quot;unite&quot; behind Truss or risk losing the next election.

In September 2022, Duncan Smith declined an offer to serve in Liz Truss&#x27;s cabinet. After Tom Tugendhat was chosen as Minister of State for Security, Duncan Smith announced he was considering seeking the Chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.

In September 2022, Duncan Smith joined a number of senior Conservative Party members in calling for the Chinese government&#x27;s invitation to the Queen&#x27;s funeral to be withdrawn.

Duncan Smith endorsed Rishi Sunak in the October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election.

At the 2024 general election, Duncan Smith was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 35.6% and an increased majority of 4,758.

==Political views==
===Views on gay rights and marriage===
During his leadership campaign in 2001, Duncan Smith changed his stance from opposing the repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 to supporting its repeal. His decision to give Conservative MPs a free vote on the issue was described as &quot;illogical&quot; and &quot;messy&quot; by other Conservative MPs in 2003.

As leader, he imposed a three-line whip to support a House of Lords amendment to the Adoption and Children Act 2002 that would have restricted adoption to married couples, disqualifying gay couples at the time. The amendment was rejected by 344 to 145, with eight Conservative MPs rebelling.

Duncan Smith has become significantly involved in issues of family and social breakdown. He has stated his support for early interventions to reduce and prevent social breakdown. In December 2010, he studied a state-sponsored relationship education programme in Norway, under which couples were forced to &quot;think again&quot; and confront the reality of divorce before formally separating. The policy has been credited with reversing Norway&#x27;s trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to £100 billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to &quot;work through what is going to happen with their children&quot;, which has &quot;a very big effect on their thinking&quot;. &quot;Many of them think again about what they are going to embark on once they really understand the consequences of their actions subsequently,&quot; he said.

Duncan Smith said in February 2011 that it was &quot;absurd and damaging&quot; for ministers not to extol the benefits of marriage for fear of stigmatising those who choose not to marry. Duncan Smith said: &quot;We do a disservice to society if we ignore the evidence which shows that stable families tend to be associated with better outcomes for children. There are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage.&quot; He added that &quot;The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high. But what is most painful to see is the human cost – the wasted potential, the anti-social behaviour, and the low self-esteem.&quot; In April 2012, he signalled his support for same-sex marriage on the basis that it would promote stability in relationships.

=== Views on immigration ===
Duncan Smith has said that tighter immigration controls are vital if Britain is to avoid &quot;losing another generation to dependency and hopelessness&quot;. In a speech delivered in Spain in 2011 he said that only immigrants with &quot;something to offer&quot; should be allowed into the country and that too often foreign workers purporting to be skilled take low-skilled jobs that could be occupied by British school leavers. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s analysis, the speech contained a warning to David Cameron &quot;that a &quot;slack&quot; attitude to immigration will result in the coalition repeating the mistakes made under Labour, when the vast majority of new jobs generated before the recession were taken by immigrants&quot;. Duncan Smith believes that some companies are using immigration as &quot;an excuse to import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already in Britain&quot;. He says Britain needs an immigration system that gives the unemployed &quot;a level playing field&quot;. &quot;If we do not get this right then we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the most vulnerable group who will be the most affected are young people,&quot; he said.

=== &quot;R (Miller) v. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union&quot; ===
On 3 November 2016 and in response to the decision of the High Court in &quot;R (Miller) v. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union&quot; on whether the UK government was entitled to notify an intention to leave the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union without a vote in Parliament, Duncan Smith stated that &quot;it&#x27;s not the position of the courts to tell parliament or the Government how that process should work. It never has been. Their job is to interpret what comes out of parliament, not to tell parliament how it goes about its functions.&quot;

=== Brexit ===
In December 2019, Duncan Smith voted in favour of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. When the House of Commons debated the agreement at the time, Duncan Smith argued against further scrutiny by the House, stating that Members of the House &quot;had more than 100 hours in committee over the last 3 and a half years ... If there is anything about this arrangement that we have not now debated, thrashed to death, I would love to know what it is.&quot; He later bemoaned the &quot;fine print&quot; in the Withdrawal Agreement.

== Personal life ==
Duncan Smith married Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Fremantle, daughter of the 5th Baron Cottesloe, in 1982. The couple have four children, and live in a country house belonging to his father-in-law&#x27;s estate in Swanbourne, Buckinghamshire. He is a Roman Catholic.

<text>Akseli Gallen-Kallela (born Axel Waldemar Gallén; 26 April 1865 – 7 March 1931) was a Finnish painter who is best known for his illustrations of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Finnish national epic. His work is considered a very important aspect of the Finnish national identity. He finnicized his name from Gallén to Gallen-Kallela in 1907.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Gallen-Kallela was born on 26 April 1865, in Pori, to a Swedish-speaking family. His father Peter Gallén worked as police chief and lawyer. Gallen-Kallela was raised in Tyrvää. At age 11, he was sent to Helsinki to study at a grammar school, because his father opposed his ambition to become a painter. After his father&#x27;s death in 1879, Gallen-Kallela attended drawing classes at the Finnish Art Society (1881–1884) and studied privately under Adolf von Becker.

===Paris===

In 1884, he moved to Paris, to study at the Académie Julian. In Paris he became friends with the Finnish painter Albert Edelfelt, the Norwegian painter Carl Dørnberger, and the Swedish writer August Strindberg. During this period he traveled back and forth between Finland and Paris.

===Mary Slöör===
He married Mary Slöör in 1890. The couple had three children: Impi Marjatta, Kirsti and Jorma. On their honeymoon to East Karelia, Gallen-Kallela started collecting material for his depictions of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. His work during this period is characterized by romantic paintings of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, such as the &quot;Aino Myth&quot;, and by several landscape paintings, although by 1894 the influence of symbolism is heavily visible in his works.

===Berlin and tragedy===
In December 1894, Gallen-Kallela moved to Berlin to oversee the joint exhibition of his works with the works of Norwegian painter Edvard Munch. At the time Gallen-Kallela also designed a grand cabin called &quot;Kalela&quot; for his family far from everything on the shore of Lake Ruovesi. It was built from dead standing pine by 13 local carpenters in a year from 1894 to 1895.

In March 1895, his trip was ended when he received a telegram that his daughter Impi Marjatta had died from diphtheria, which would prove to be a turning point in his work. Hs works had been romantic, but after his daughter&#x27;s death, Gallen-Kallela&#x27;s works became more aggressive. From 1896 to 1899, he painted what are considered his most famous works: &quot;The Defense of the Sampo&quot;, &quot;Lemminkäinen&#x27;s Mother&quot;, &quot;Joukahainen&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Kullervo&#x27;s Curse&quot;. In May 1895, Gallen and Mary visited London, with his intent being the purchase of a graphic art press. There, he also learned about stained glass. At the end of 1897 the family took a trip to Florence, also visiting Pompeii, where he studied the art of frescoes.

===Paris 1900 Exposition===
For the Paris World Fair in 1900, Gallen-Kallela painted frescoes for the Finnish Pavilion. In the fresco &quot;Ilmarinen Plowing the Field of Vipers&quot; there was a hidden political message: one of the vipers is wearing a small Romanov crown, telling of Gallen-Kallela&#x27;s wish for an independent Finland at the time of the Russification of Finland.

The Paris Exposition secured Gallen-Kallela&#x27;s stature as the leading Finnish artist. In 1901, he was commissioned to paint the fresco, &quot;Kullervo Sets Off for War&quot;, for the concert hall of the Helsinki Student&#x27;s Union. Between 1901 and 1903, he painted the frescoes for the Jusélius Mausoleum in Pori, memorializing the 11-year-old daughter of the industrialist Fritz Arthur Jusélius. (The frescoes however were soon damaged by dampness, and were completely destroyed by fire in December 1931. Jusélius assigned the artist&#x27;s son Jorma to repaint them from the original sketches. The reconstruction was completed just before Jorma&#x27;s death in 1939.)

Gallen-Kallela officially finnicized his name to Akseli Gallen-Kallela in 1907. His idea for a 700-page &quot;&quot; was fully formed in 1909 with a publication of his plan in the &quot;Valvoja&quot; magazine.

===Kenya===
In 1908, with renewal in mind, Gallen-Kallela and his family moved to Paris. However the city and the new direction art was being taken didn&#x27;t feel as hospitable as he had hoped, and so in May 1909 they moved much further away to Nairobi in Kenya. He was the first Finnish artist to paint south of the Sahara, and produced over 150 expressionistic works. Although artistically the paintings are of fluctuating quality, their colors and the synergy of the colors are remarkable. They returned to Finland in February 1911. Between 1911 and 1913, he designed and built a studio and house for his family at Tarvaspää, approximately 10 km northwest of the centre of Helsinki.

===Finnish Civil War===

The family moved back from Tarvaspää to Kalela in 1915 to escape the turmoil of the First World War. In 1918, Gallen-Kallela and his son Jorma took part in the fighting at the front of the Finnish Civil War. When the regent, General Mannerheim, heard about that, he invited Gallen-Kallela to design the flags, official decorations and uniforms for the newlyindependent Finland. For the flag, Gallen-Kallela proposed a white-blue cross flag, with colors inverted (white cross on blue), but it was considered too similar to the Swedish flag and particularly the era&#x27;s Greek flag. In 1919, he was appointed aide-de-camp to Mannerheim. In 1920, he made an agreement with the publishing company WSOY for the eventual publication of &quot;Great Kalevala&quot;, with the less decorative &quot;Koru-Kalevala&quot; being published first in 1922.

===Taos, New Mexico, later life, and death===
In December 1923, he moved to the United States, where his family followed him in autumn 1924. He first spent time in Chicago, and an exhibition of his work toured several cities. In Chicago, he was impressed by Native American art and moved to Taos, New Mexico, at the art colony there to study it further. During his time in the United States, he began sketching out the &quot;Great Kalevala&quot; in much more detail. In May 1926, the family returned to Finland. In 1928, together with his son Jormam he painted the &quot;Kalevala&quot; frescoes at the lobby of the National Museum of Finland. In 1930, he made an agreement to paint a gigantic fresco for the bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, but on 7 March 1931, while returning from a lecture in Copenhagen, he suddenly died of pneumonia in Stockholm.

==Legacy==
His studio and house at Tarvaspää was opened as the Gallen-Kallela Museum in 1961 and house some of his works and research facilities on him.

<text>Tourism in Spain is a major contributor to national economic life, with foreign and domestic tourism contributing to 12.3% of Spain&#x27;s GDP (in 2023). The international tourist expenditure in 2024 was around 126 billion euros. Since 1959, the tourism industry has become one of the key sectors of the Spanish economy. The country has been a popular destination for summer holidays, especially with large numbers of tourists from the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, the Benelux, and the United States, among others. Accordingly, Spain&#x27;s foreign tourist industry has grown into the second-biggest in the world. 
In 2024, Spain was the second most visited country in the world, recording around 94 million international tourists, which marked the eighth consecutive year of record-breaking numbers.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, only 18.9 million tourists visited Spain. These dramatic figures were devastating for the tourism sector and were a reflection of what would become the worst year for this industry, in terms of income, ever recorded. However, by 2022 the industry had mostly recovered, with 71,659,281 international tourists and increasing.

Spain ranks first among 140 countries in the biannual Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index published by the World Economic Forum in 2019, matching the top position already achieved in 2017 and 2015. The World Tourism Organization has its headquarters in Madrid.

==Arrivals by country==
Most visitors arriving to Spain on a short-term basis were from the following countries:
== Transport ==

Spain&#x27;s national airline is Iberia, but the country can be flown into on many international passenger airlines and charter airlines.

Tourists also arrive in Spain by road, rail and over the water. Spanish freeways interconnecting the touristic cities are also linked with the French freeway network across the Pyrenees. The main train operator is Renfe, including AVE (Spanish high speed train) or Talgo intercity services. Spain&#x27;s high-speed rail link is the largest in Europe and second largest in the world after China. There is also a number of high-end tourism oriented hotel-train services, such as Transcantábrico.

== Summer resorts and beaches ==


This type of tourism was the first to be developed in Spain, and today, generates the most income for the Spanish economy.
The mild climate during the whole year and the extensive sandy beaches of the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean as well as of its two archipelagoes (the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands respectively) have been attracting tourists from Northern Europe for decades. The leading source markets of Spanish beach tourism are the UK (around 24% of the total arrivals in Spain in recent years), Germany and France (around 15-16% each), followed by Scandinavia and Italy (around 7% each) and the Netherlands (around 5%).

The most popular Spanish mainland coasts are on its Mediterranean side, and include, from north to south clockwise:

*The Costa Brava, the Costa Daurada and the Costa del Maresme, in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, very popular with visitors from France as well as inland Spain, with notable resorts like Salou and the city of Barcelona.
*The Costa Blanca, (one of the most developed coastal areas of Spain, extremely popular for tourists from the United Kingdom and Germany, with Benidorm as the leading summer city of Spain) and the Costa del Azahar are both in the Valencian Community.
*The Costa Cálida in the Region of Murcia and the Mar Menor, a lagoon by the Mediterranean sea.
*The Costa de Almería, the Costa Tropical, the Costa del Sol and the Costa de la Luz, all in the community of Andalusia. Some of the summer destinations here are renowned worldwide, such as Marbella in Málaga Province or Sotogrande in Cádiz province, both destinations for tourists and summer residents with big purchasing power. The city of Málaga is a notable Costa del Sol destination and also one of the largest harbours in Spain and frequented by cruise ships.
Spain&#x27;s two archipelagoes, the Balearic Islands off the mainland coast in the Mediterranean and the volcanic Canary Islands in the Atlantic, are also both very popular destinations with Spaniards and Europeans.

In addition to the summer tourism, other modalities like cultural and monumental tourism congresses, sport or fun tourism have been developed in these areas, including such famous cities as Barcelona and Valencia, the biggest harbours of the Spanish Mediterranean coast.

Many coastal or island places also have great ecological and natural importance. Theme Parks like Terra Mítica, Tibidabo Amusement Park, Tivoli World and the resort PortAventura World or diverse water-fun parks are also popular.

In 2014 Spain broke its own record of blue flag beaches, achieving 681 flags and becoming the leader in the Northern Hemisphere. Spain is also the leader in blue flags for marinas.

== Cultural tourism, business tourism ==

As a crossroads of several civilisations, Spain offers a number of historical cities and towns. Major destinations include Spain&#x27;s two largest cities: Madrid and Barcelona, which stand as two of the leading city destinations in Europe. Both offer a matchless number of attractions and their importance in commerce, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, sports and arts contribute to their status as two of the world&#x27;s major global cities.
Fifteen Spanish cities have been declared World Heritage Cities by the UNESCO:
Alcalá de Henares, Ávila, Baeza, Cáceres, Córdoba, Cuenca, Ibiza, Mérida, Salamanca, San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Santiago de Compostela, Segovia, Tarragona, Toledo and Úbeda . As of October 2016, Spain has 45 total sites inscribed on the list, third only to Italy (51) and China (50). Of these 45 sites, 40 are cultural, 3 are natural, and 2 are mixed (meeting both cultural and natural criteria), as determined by the organization&#x27;s selection criteria.
Other first-class destinations are Seville, Granada, Santander, Oviedo, Gijón, Bilbao and San Sebastián. All of them with historical landmarks and a lively cultural agenda.

=== Student programs ===

Besides hosting some of the most renowned business schools in the world such as IE Business School, ESADE or IESE Business School, Spain is a popular destination for students from abroad. In particular, during the 2010–11 academic year Spain was the European country receiving the most Erasmus Programme students.

=== Religion ===
Spain is an important place for Catholicism. In fact, some of the holiest places for the Catholic Church are in Spain: city of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia (North-West Spain), the third holiest place after the Vatican City in Rome and Jerusalem. It is also the terminus of the Way of Saint James. Santo Toribio de Liébana, Cantabria (also in North Spain) is the fourth, followed by Caravaca de la Cruz at the South-East, (fifth holiest place). These places attract pilgrims and tourists from all over the world.
Religion also has found its artistic expression through the popular Holy Week processions, which become important in almost every town, Seville arguably holds some of the most elaborate processions for Holy Week.

=== Festivals ===

Most festivals turn around patron saints, legends, local customs and folklore. Among the most singular ones stand out the Seville Fair (Feria de Abril in Spanish), the Romería de El Rocío in Almonte, Huelva, the world-famous Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, the Falles in Valencia, the Tomatina in Buñol, Valencia and the Fiestas del Pilar in Zaragoza.

The Carnival is also popular all over Spain, but especially in the Canary Islands (Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife) and Cádiz. 
There are renowned movie festivals all over the country, the most recognizable being the famous San Sebastián International Film Festival, the Málaga Film Festival, the Seminci (Valladolid International Film Festival), the Mostra de Valencia and the Sitges Film Festival, the world&#x27;s foremost international festival specializing in fantasy and horror movies. Music festivals includes the Sónar, the FIB, the Festimad, the Primavera Sound, the Bilbao BBK Live, the Monegros Desert Festival and the SOS 4.8 Festival.

Several cities have hosted international events: the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, the 1992 Summer Olympics, all in Barcelona, the Universal fair of 1992 in Seville, the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup in Valencia, and the Expo 2008 in Zaragoza. In addition, some Spanish cities have been or will be European Capital of Culture: Madrid in 1992; Santiago de Compostela in 2000, Salamanca in 2002, and San Sebastián in 2016.

== Nightlife ==

The nightlife in Spain is very attractive to both tourists and locals. Spain is known to have some of the best nightlife in the world. Big cities such as Madrid and Barcelona are favorites amongst the large and popular discothèques. For instance, Madrid is known as the number one party city for clubs such as Pacha and Kapital (seven floors), and Barcelona is famous for Opium and Sutton famous clubs. The discothèques in Spain are open until hours such as 7am. The Baleraric Islands, such as Ibiza and Mallorca, are known to be major party destinations, as well as favored summer resort and in Andalusia, Malaga, specially the area of the Costa del Sol. Madrid is reputed to have a &quot;vibrant nightlife&quot;.

Ibiza is a relatively small island and its cities have become world-famous for their associations with tourism, nightlife, and the electronic music the island has originated. Ibiza has garnered the reputation as the &quot;Party Capital of the world&quot;. It is well known for its summer club scene which attracts very large numbers of tourists, but the island&#x27;s government and the Spanish Tourist Office have controversially been working to promote more family-oriented tourism. Noted clubs include Space, Privilege, Amnesia, Ushuaïa, Pacha, DC10, Eden, and Es Paradis. Ibiza is also home to the legendary &quot;port&quot; in Ibiza Town, a popular stop for many tourists and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Majorca or Mallorca is an island located in the Mediterranean Sea. It is the largest island in the Balearic Islands archipelago, in Spain.

The capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Cabrera Archipelago is administratively grouped with Majorca (in the municipality of Palma). The anthem of Majorca is &quot;La Balanguera&quot;.

Like the other Balearic Islands of Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera, the island is an extremely popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from Germany, Ireland, Poland, the Scandinavian countries, and the United Kingdom. The name derives from Latin &quot;insula maior&quot;, &quot;larger island&quot;; later &quot;Maiorica&quot;, &quot;the larger one&quot; in comparison to Menorca, &quot;the smaller one&quot;.

==Winter tourism==


Spain is a generally mountainous country, with well-known ski resorts located in several parts of the country, including the Pyrenees, the Sistema Central, the Sistema Ibérico and Sierra Nevada.
For the most part, the main crest forms a massive divider between France and Spain, with the tiny country of Andorra sandwiched in between. The Crown of Aragon and the Kingdom of Navarre have historically extended on both sides of the mountain range, with small northern portions now in France and much larger southern parts now in Spain.

Sierra Nevada in Spain is a popular tourist destination, as its high peaks make skiing possible in one of Europe&#x27;s most southerly ski resorts, in an area along the Mediterranean Sea predominantly known for its warm temperatures and abundant sunshine. At its foothills is found the city of Granada and, a little further, Almería and Málaga.

Parts of the range have been included in the Sierra Nevada National Park. The range has also been declared a biosphere reserve. The Sierra Nevada Observatory is located on the northern slopes at an elevation of . The Sierra Nevada was formed during the Alpine Orogeny, a mountain-building event that also formed the European Alps to the east and the Atlas Mountains of northern Africa across the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Sierra as observed today formed during the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (66 to 1.8 million years ago) from the collision of the African and Eurasian continental plates.

== Nature and rural tourism ==
Spain is the second largest country in the European Union. Its latitude puts part of the country in direct contact with the typical southern end of the Atlantic polar jet. Hence, Spain&#x27;s geographical position allows for Atlantic fronts typically affecting its western and northern part whereas a Mediterranean influenced climate is generally prevalent in its eastern and southern parts, with transition climates linking both main bioclimatic regions. Additionally the presence of several mountain ranges ultimately shape the diverse landscape of Spain. Another remarkable feature of the country is its vast coast, as a result of being in a Peninsula; moreover, there is the coast of the two Spanish archipelagos: the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.
To date, Spain has a total of 15 National Parks, of which 10 are on the mainland, 1 in the Balearic Islands and 4 in the Canary Islands. Spain&#x27;s most visited National Park is the Teide National Park in the Canary Islands, with 3,142,148 visitors in 2007 and crowned with the third largest Volcano in the world from its base, the Teide, with 3,718 meters above the sea level (also the highest point in Spain). The Teide also has the distinction of being the most visited national park in Europe and second in the world.

On top of that, by 2016 Spain is home to 48 biosphere reserves, covering 5.5 million hectares, almost 11% of the country, making Spain the world leader of such protected areas

==Art and culture==
===Museums in Madrid===

Madrid is considered one of the top European destinations concerning art museums. Best known is the &quot;Golden Triangle of Art&quot;, located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising three museums. The most famous one is the Museo del Prado, known for such highlights as Diego Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Las Meninas&quot; and Francisco de Goya&#x27;s &quot;La maja vestida&quot; and &quot;La maja desnuda&quot;. The other two museums are the Thyssen Bornemisza Museum, established from a mixed private collection, and the Reina Sofia Museum, where Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot; hangs, returning to Spain from New York after more than two decades.

El Prado is one of the most visited museums in the world, and it is considered to be among the greatest museums of art. It has the best collection of paintings by Goya, Velázquez, El Greco, Patinir, José de Ribera, and other Spanish artists, as well as major collections of Rubens, Titian, Hieronymus Bosch, Rogier van der Weyden, Raphael, Tintoretto, Veronese, Caravaggio, Van Dyck, Albrecht Dürer, Claude Lorrain, Murillo and Zurbarán, among others.

The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (MNCARS) is the Spain&#x27;s national museum of 20th-century art. The museum is mainly dedicated to Spanish art. Highlights of the museum include excellent collections of Spain&#x27;s greatest 20th-century masters, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, Joan Miró, Juan Gris and Julio González.

The Reina Sofía also hosts a free-access library specializing in art, with a collection of over 100,000 books, over 3,500 sound recordings and almost 1,000 videos.

The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum is an art museum that fills the historical gaps in its counterparts&#x27; collections: in the Prado&#x27;s case this includes Early Italian painting and works from the English, Dutch and German schools, while in the case of the Reina Sofia the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, once the second largest private collection in the world after the British Royal Collection, includes Impressionists, Expressionists, and European and American paintings from the second half of the 20th century, with over 1,600 paintings.

The Museum of the Americas is a national museum that holds artistic, archaeological and ethnographic collections from the whole Americas, ranging from the Paleolithic period to the present day. The permanent exhibit is divided into five major thematical areas: an awareness of the Americas, the reality of the Americas, society, religion and communication.

The National Museum of Natural Sciences is the National Museum of Natural History of Spain. The research departments of the museum are: Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, Evolutionary Ecology, Paleobiology, Vulcanology and Geology.
The Naval Museum is managed by the Ministry of Defence. The Museum&#x27;s mission is to acquire, preserve, investigate, report and display for study, education and contemplation, parts, sets and collections of historical, artistic, scientific and technical related to naval activity in order to disseminate the story sea of Spain; to help illustrate, highlight and preserve their traditions and promote national maritime awareness.

The Monastery of Las Descalzas Reales resides in the former palace of King Charles I of Spain and Isabel of Portugal. Their daughter, Joan of Austria, founded this convent of nuns of the Poor Clare order in 1559. Throughout the remainder of the 16th century and into the 17th century, the convent attracted young widowed or spinster noblewomen. Each woman brought with her a dowry. The riches quickly piled up, and the convent became one of the richest convents in all of Europe. It has many works of Renaissance and Baroque art, including a recumbent Christ by Gaspar Becerra, a staircase whose paintings were painted by unknown author (perhaps Velázquez) and they are considered of the masterpieces of Spanish illusionist painting, and Brussels tapestries inspired by paintings of Rubens.
The Museum of Lázaro Galdiano houses an encyclopedic collection specializing in decorative arts.
Apart from paintings and sculptures it displays 10th-century Byzantine enamel; Arab and Byzantine ivory chests; Hellenistic, Roman, medieval, renaissance, baroque and romantic jewelry; Pisanello and Pompeo Leoni medals; Spanish and Italian ceramics; Italian and Arab clothes and a collection of weapons including the sword of Pope Innocent VIII.
The Museo Nacional de Artes Decorativas (National Museum of Decorative Arts) is one of the oldest museums in the city. It illustrates the evolution of the called &quot;minor arts&quot; (furniture, ceramics and glass, textile, etc.). Its 60 rooms expones 15,000 objects, of the approximate 40,000 which it has.
The Museo Nacional del Romanticismo (National Museum of Romanticism) contains a large collection of artefacts and art, focusing on daily life and customs of the 19th century, with special attention to the aesthetics about Romanticism.
The Museo Cerralbo houses a private collection of ancient works of art, artifacts and other antiquities collected by Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa, XVII Cerralbo Marquis.
The National Museum of Anthropology provides an overview of the different cultures in the world, with objects and human remains from around the world, highlighting a Guanche mummy of the island of Tenerife.
 
The Museo Sorolla is located in the building in which the Valencian Impressionist painter had his home and workshop. The collection includes, in addition to numerous works of Joaquín Sorolla, a large number of objects that possessed the artist, including sculptures by Auguste Rodin.
CaixaForum Madrid is a post-modern art gallery in the centre of Madrid. It is sponsored by the Catalan-Balearic bank la Caixa and located next to the Salón del Prado. Although the CaixaForum is a modern building, it also exhibits retrospectives of artists from earlier time periods and has evolved into one of the most visited museums in Madrid. It was constructed by the Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron from 2001 to 2007, which combined an old unused industrial building and hollowed it out at the base and inside and placed on top further floors which are encased with rusted steel. Next to it is an art installation of green plants growing on the wall of the neighbouring house by French botanist Patrick Blanc. The red of the top floors with the green of the wall next to it form a contrast. The green is in reflection of the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens.

== Impact of COVID-19 ==
In early 2020, the country halted its tourism industry following the spread of COVID-19. Spain reopened to fully vaccinated travellers from around the world on 7 June 2021; however, due to the relatively late announcement of the reopening, the initial increase in visitors was gradual.

<text>A brain teaser is a form of puzzle that requires thought to solve. It often requires thinking in unconventional ways with given constraints in mind; sometimes it also involves lateral thinking. Logic puzzles and riddles are specific types of brain teasers.

One of the earliest known brain teaser enthusiasts was the Greek mathematician Archimedes. He devised mathematical problems for his contemporaries to solve.

==Example==
:Q: &quot;If three hens lay three eggs in three days, how many eggs does a (statistical) hen lay in one day?&quot;
:A1: &quot;One third.&quot; (Note: 3 hens = 3 eggs / 3 days → 3 hens = (3 / 3) (eggs / days) → 1 hen = (1 / 3) (egg / days))
:A2: &quot;Zero or one&quot; (it&#x27;s hard to lay a third of an egg).

One can argue about the answers of many brain teasers; in the given example with hens, one might claim that all the eggs in the question were laid in the first day, so the answer would be three.

:Q: &quot;Mary&#x27;s father has five daughters: 1. Nana, 2. Nene, 3. Nini, 4. Nono. What is the name of the fifth daughter?&quot;
:A: &quot;Mary&quot;. The first four daughters all have names with the first 4 vowels, so if someone does not think about the question, they may say the name with the fifth vowel, Nunu. The answer was given at the beginning of the question (i.e., Mary&#x27;s father has five...)

:Q: &quot;What appears once in a minute, twice in a moment, but never in a thousand years?&quot;
:A: The letter &quot;M&quot;.

:Q: &quot;I am the beginning of the end, the beginning of eternity, and the end of all time?&quot;
:A: The letter &quot;E&quot;.

==Intuition==
The difficulty of many brain teasers relies on a certain degree of fallacy in human intuitiveness. This is most common in brain teasers relating to conditional probability, because the causal human mind tends to consider absolute probability instead. As a result, controversial discussions emerge from such problems. One of the famous brain teasers is the Monty Hall problem. Another (simpler) example of such a brain teaser is the Boy or Girl paradox.

<doc id="159570" wikidata="Q5384" url="?curid=159570" title="Kirov, Kirov Oblast">
<text>Kirov (, ), formerly known as Vyatka () until 1934 and as Khlynov () from 1457 to 1780, is the largest city and administrative center of Kirov Oblast, Russia. It is situated on the Vyatka River in European Russia, northeast of Moscow. Its population was 468,212 in 2021, up to roughly 750 thousand residents in the urban agglomeration.

The city was founded in 1374 (according to other sources in 1181). It was the center of Vyatka Land, which was settled by Russians during the Middle Ages. It was renamed &quot;Kirov&quot; after the Bolshevik politician Sergei Kirov in 1934, even though he never visited the city.

It is an important economic, transportation, industrial, educational and cultural center in Volga-Vyatka region. It is also home to the many Russian folk crafts, such as Dymkovo toys, vyatka lace and carving on a capa-root. In the historic part of the city there are many universities, theaters, museums and churches.

==History==
=== Principality and republic ===
The native Slavic tribe in Central Russia and the Volga region, the Vyatichi (also called Viatichi), mixed here with the Novgorodian Slovenes and Finno-Ugric peoples. 

According to the &quot;Tale of the Vyatka Country&quot;, the city was founded on the Balaskov Field either in 1181 or in 1199. Based on archaeological data, the emergence of the city should be attributed to the middle-end of the 13 century.

Kirov itself was first mentioned (as Vyatka) for the first time in 1374, when Novgorodian ushkuyniks plundered it on their way to Bolghar. Vyatka was governed by a public assembly (veche) like the other northern Russian republics of Pskov and Novgorod.

At different times in the late 14th and 15th centuries, Vyatka militias raided Ustyug, Novgorod and Tatar lands in the Kama and Volga regions. 

In 1412, a battle took place near the city between the Vyatchans and Ustyuzhans. The battle took place at night in a ravine, later named Razderikhinsky. According to one version, the Ustyuzhans came to the aid of the Vyatchans for defense against the Tatars, according to another, they, in alliance with the Moscow princes, wanted to capture the city. In memory of those events, the Vyatka folk festival &quot;Svistoplyaska&quot; appeared, and a chapel in the name of Archangel Michael was built on the bank of the ravine.

Vyatka supported Yury of Zvenigorod during the Muscovite Civil War, and after his party lost to the victorious Vasily II, the Muscovite armies were sent twice to subjugate Vyatka until it was eventually forced to accept the suzerainty of Moscow, while retaining a significant amount of autonomy. In 1469, Vyatka allied with Khan Ibrahim of the Khanate of Kazan and did not take part in the campaign of Ivan III against the khanate.

Until the end of the 15 century, Vyatka land was a self-governing territory. The People&#x27;s Assembly acted as the main governing body. The most influential group of the feudal class were the boyars, followed by merchants and clergy. The rest of the Vyatchans represented the free communal population and consisted of peasants and artisans.

After several unsuccessful campaigns by Moscow against Vyatka in the 1480s, the latter was finally annexed in 1489.

=== Tsarist Russia ===
In the 17 century, the military significance of Khlynov was replaced by trade: merchants from Siberia, the Urals, Pomerania and other regions came here for the Semenovskaya Fair. In 1657, the Vyatka Diocese was established. It was here that the Vyatka chronicles were created. The Kremlin was completely rebuilt during the reign of Alexis of Russia. Under his son Peter, manufactory production was established.

In 1694, the merchant Spiridon Lyangusov conducted the first trade caravan from Moscow to China after the conclusion of the Russian-Chinese treaty, which allowed mutual trade.

Khlynov became known throughout Russia for its clay statuettes and whistles. The town&#x27;s oldest surviving monument is the Assumption Cathedral (1689), an imposing structure surmounted by five globular domes.

In 1780, Catherine the Great renamed the town Vyatka and made it the seat of Vyatka Governorate. The town also served as a place of exile, notably for Alexander Herzen, Alexander Vitberg, and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. By the end of the 19th century, it was an important station on the Trans-Siberian railway.
=== Soviet period ===
On the eve of the February Revolution, there was no particular aggravation of the social and political struggle in Vyatka province and Vyatka. The October revolution of the Bolsheviks in Petrograd was declared illegal, the provincial governorate remained loyal to the Provisional Government. 

The Bolsheviks, until the end of the autumn of 1917, had neither wide fame nor great influence in the city. The arriving detachments of soldiers and sailors, together with local Red Army, played a decisive role in the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, which did not happen immediately.
In the 1930s, the destruction of the temple city architecture began. The ensemble of the city Kremlin has been almost completely lost. In 1931 the Holy Trinity Cathedral was destroyed, in 1937 the Alexander Nevsky was blown up. Many temples managed to survive, but they were rebuilt for other, non-religious needs. Thus, the Spassky Cathedral and the Trifonov Monastery lost their towers. The Cathedral mosque, underwent the same process. In the future, the appearance of these buildings will be restored.

On 1934, regular public transport appeared in the city for the first time.

In December 1934, it was renamed after the Soviet communist party functionary Sergey Kirov, who was assassinated on December 1, who was born in nearby Urzhum, despite him never visiting the city himself.

During the Second World War, due to the evacuation of machine-building plants from Moscow and Leningrad, the Kirov industry was mainly formed.

In the post-war years, new industrial and agricultural enterprises came into operation, active development and mass housing construction began in the western and southern parts of the city.
=== Recent history ===

There have been movements to restore the city&#x27;s original name of Vyatka, although none of them have been successful so far.

Since the 2010s, the city has been actively positioning itself as a venue for various forums and festivals. In particular, the Golden Calf International Short Film Festival, the All-Russian Urban Forum, and the sites of the Atomic Energy Information Center began to be held in the city.

In 2024, the city of Kirov commemorated its 650th anniversary with a series of events and initiatives. Preparations included infrastructure renovations, cultural programs, educational and publishing activities, as well as exhibitions and festivals. The anniversary was marked on June 12 (City Day) and September 22 (City Foundation Day), with over 100 events organized. Key highlights included the theatrical show &quot;The City Created by You&quot;, a concert by the band Lyube, a fireworks display, a gastronomic festival, and a performance by the aerobatic team &quot;Strizhi&quot;.

== Administrative and municipal status ==
Kirov is the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with 134 rural localities, incorporated as the City of Kirov—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Kirov is incorporated as Kirov Urban Okrug.

The city of Kirov is divided into 4 urban districts: Leninsky, Oktyabrsky, Pervomaysky and Novovyatsky.

==Economy==
The basis of the economic potential of the city of Kirov is the manufacturing sector — manufacturing industries; enterprises that produce and distribute electricity, gas and water; transport, construction organizations and communication enterprises.

The city of Kirov is known in Russia and abroad for the products of heavy engineering, aircraft and machine tool construction, woodworking and light industry, folk crafts. Washing machines, electric stoves, furniture, skis, wood stove, tires, leather and fur products are produced here.

== Main sights ==

The main sights of the city are concentrated near Spasskaya Street in the historical part of the city. At the beginning of this street is the ensemble of the Trifonov Monastery, founded in 1580, which includes the main building – the Uspenskiy Cathedral, and several churches around it, surrounded by walls with towers. The monastery has extensive views from the &quot;Arch of the Vyatka Kremlin&quot;, located on a hill on the opposite side of Spasskaya Street. The &quot;Arch of the Vyatka Kremlin&quot; actually refers to the former bishop&#x27;s compound, which was blown up in the 1930s.

Next to the complex of the Trifonov Monastery is the Yezhovsky Lake, along which there is an eco-trail. Among other things, there is a pier on it, which offers a view of the monastery.

Further down Spasskaya Street there is a Klobukov store – one of the first shopping centers of pre-revolutionary Vyatka, made in the Art Nouveau style. Next to it is the Spassky Cathedral, one of the most iconic temples of the city, founded in 1763.

Starting from Klobukov&#x27;s shop, the pedestrian part of Spasskaya Street begins. On its sides, in the buildings of the former shopping malls, there are the Kirov Museum of Local Lore, the Ice cream Museum, the Chocolate Museum, the &quot;Theater on Spasskaya&quot;. Up to Karl Marx Street, there are architectural monuments, cafes and restaurants on Spasskaya Street. These include the building of the main post office – a rare example of constructivism in Vyatka. The Vasnetsov Brothers Art Museum is located at the intersection of Spasskaya and Karl Marx Streets.

Along the Embankment of the Green on a high hill, there is the Alexander Garden, one of the first parks of the city, which has views over the Vyatka River. On the edge of the hill there are white rotundas, which have become one of the symbols of the city. The embankment stretches from the old bridge and ends with a descent to the complex of the Trifonov Monastery.

Along the southern part of Oktyabrsky Avenue, after the intersection with Vorovsky Street, the Central Park of the city is laid out. An artificial two-level pond has been created in the park, on top of which the Diorama building is located. Created according to the original project, it has the shape of a waving flag. A bas-relief was constructed on the upper part. The Diorama building houses the Museum of Revolutionary Events in Vyatka. The Kirov Circus and the Ferris Wheel are also located on the territory of the Central Park.A ravine runs through the central part of the city, along Gorbachev Street. Its relief was beaten in the area of the intersection of Gorbachev and Karl Marx Streets, where the Botanical Garden at Vyatka University and the square of the 60th anniversary of the USSR (Square named after Grin) were created.

The oldest monument of civil architecture is a Piteyniy dom () house located at the intersection of Spasskaya and Kazanskaya streets. The earliest mention of the house dates back to 1771. Now there are exhibitions of the regional Museum of local lore.

A number of the city&#x27;s mansions are located along the streets of Moskovskaya, Spasskaya, Preobrazhenskaya, Kazanskaya and Lenin. Bulychev&#x27;s mansion is a particularly notable example of Gothic architecture. Examples of the pre-revolutionary capitalist style are the buildings of the Veretennikov Bank and the Bank of Foreign Trade. Repin&#x27;s estate and Arshaulov&#x27;s house are just a few examples of elegant stone architecture.

The list of temples in the city center, in addition to the above, includes: the Spaso-Preobrazhenskiy Convent (1696-1883), the Cathedral of Seraphim of Sarov (1904), the Church of John the Baptist (1717), the Chapel of the Archangel Michael (1866, restored in 1999), the Znamenskaya (Tsarevo-Konstantinovskaya) Church with a bell tower (1778, restored), Feodorovskaya Church (1913, in 2007 a new wooden one was built on the site of the destroyed church. In 2022, the wooden church burned down, the church is expected to be recreated according to the original project.), the Chapel of the Holy Prophet Elijah (2003), the Church in honor of the Icon of the Most Holy Theotokos &quot;Vsekh skorbyashchikh radost&quot; () (2012), the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (1903, services are held in the parish house). There are many more temples and chapels located throughout the city.A unique example of modern is the building of the Palace of Pioneers, created according to the original project. It is located in the middle of the park and is a structure with a stylized roof in the form of a red pioneer tie, waving upwards.

In the northern part of the city, in the Fileyka district, is a symbol of the Soviet era - a complex of ski jumps. The most important of them has a height of 90 meters, which, combined with the location on the top of the ravine, near the embankment, gives an impressive effect.

<text>This is a list of cities and towns in Belarus. Neither the Belarusian nor the Russian language makes a distinction between &quot;city&quot; and &quot;town&quot; as English does; the word &quot;horad&quot; ( ) or &quot;gorod&quot; ( ) is used for both.

==Overview==
Belarusian legislation uses a three-level hierarchy of town classifications.

According to the Law under May 5, 1998, the categories of the most developed urban localities in Belarus are as follows:
* &quot;capital&quot; — Minsk;
* &quot;city of regional subordinance&quot; (; ) — urban locality with a population of not less than 50,000 people; it has its own body of self-government, known as &quot;Council of Deputies&quot; (; ) and an executive committee (; ), which stand on the level with these of a &quot;raion&quot; ().
* &quot;city of district subordinance&quot; (; ) — urban locality with a population of more than 6,000 people; it may have its own body of self-government (; ) and an executive committee (; ), which belong to the same level as these of rural councils and of s.c. &quot;haradski pasiolak&quot; (; ) (a type of a smaller urban locality).

This division was inherited by the contemporary Republic of Belarus from the Byelorussian SSR and introduced in 1938.

As of 2020, 115 settlements had the status of a city/town. Among them:
* 10 cities of regional subordinance;
* 104 towns of district subordinance;
* Minsk — the capital of the country.

<doc id="159577" wikidata="Q35493" url="?curid=159577" title="Almaty">
<text>Almaty, formerly Alma-Ata, is the largest city in Kazakhstan, with a population exceeding two million residents within its metropolitan area. Located in the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains in southern Kazakhstan, near the border with Kyrgyzstan, Almaty stands as a pivotal center of culture, commerce, finance and innovation. The city is nestled at an elevation of 700–900 metres (2,300–3,000 feet), with the Big Almaty and Small Almaty rivers running through it, originating from the surrounding mountains and flowing into the plains. Almaty is the second-largest city in Central Asia and the third-largest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU).

Almaty served as the capital of Kazakhstan from 1929 to 1997 during the Soviet era and after independence from 1991 until the capital was relocated to Aqmola (now Astana) in 1997. Despite no longer being the capital, Almaty remains the most cosmopolitan and influential city in Kazakhstan, often regarded as the nation&#x27;s cultural and financial heart, and is colloquially referred to as the &quot;Southern Capital&quot;. It is classified as a city of republican significance, granting it autonomy from regional governance. The city is divided into eight administrative districts within the framework of its republican significance.

Almaty is globally recognized for hosting major international events, including the Alma-Ata Primary Healthcare Conference, which shaped global public health policy, the 2011 Asian Winter Games, and the 2017 Winter Universiade. The city was also a contender to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, further solidifying its position as a prominent international hub for winter sports, but ultimately lost the bid.

Almaty is served by an extensive transportation network, including Almaty International Airport, the busiest in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, handling over 9.5 million passengers annually. The city is also served by the Almaty Metro, opened in 2011. Additionally, buses and trolleybuses contribute to the city&#x27;s comprehensive public transport system.

Almaty’s proximity to natural attractions such as the Ile-Alatau National Park, with its diverse ecosystems and scenic trails, and Big Almaty Lake, makes it a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. Additionally, the city&#x27;s close proximity to Medeu, the highest-altitude ice rink in the world, and Shymbulak ski resort, contributes to Almaty’s reputation as a major tourism hub for adventure and outdoor activities.

A member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network since 2017 in the field of music, Almaty is renowned for its cultural contributions. It is also classified as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, underscoring its economic and regional significance. Almaty is celebrated for its green spaces, with numerous urban parks, tree-lined streets, and fountains, contributing to its reputation as one of the greenest cities in the region. The city’s skyline blends historical Soviet-era buildings with modern skyscrapers, symbolizing its ongoing economic development and evolving identity.

Key landmarks and attractions in Almaty include the Central State Museum of Kazakhstan, Ascension Cathedral, Green Bazaar, Arbat, and Kök Töbe, a hilltop destination offering panoramic views of the city and the surrounding mountains. The city is also home to prestigious educational institutions such as Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, the Kazakh-British Technical University, the International Information Technology University, and Narxoz University.

==Status==

From 1929 to 1936, the city, then known as Alma-Ata, was the capital of the Kazakh ASSR. From 1936 to 1991, Alma-Ata was the capital of the Kazakh SSR. After Kazakhstan became independent in 1991, the city was renamed Almaty in 1993 and continued as the capital until 1997, when the capital was moved to Akmola (renamed Astana in 1998, Nur-Sultan in 2019, and again Astana in 2022). Since then Almaty has been referred to as the &quot;southern capital&quot; of Kazakhstan.

Almaty remains the largest, most developed, and most ethnically and culturally diverse city in Kazakhstan. Due to development by the Soviet Union and relocation of workers and industries from European areas of the Soviet Union during World War II, the city has a high proportion of ethnic Russians and Uyghurs. The city lies in the foothills of Trans-Ili Alatau (or Zailiysky Alatau) in the extreme south-east.

It has a relatively mild climate with warm and dry summers and quite cold winters. Since the city is in a tectonically active area, it has an endemic risk of earthquakes. Although most tremors do not cause any significant damage, Almaty has suffered some large destructive earthquakes.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Almaty&quot; has its roots in the medieval settlement &quot;Almatau&quot;, that existed near the present-day city. A disputed theory holds that the name is derived from the Kazakh word for &#x27;apple&#x27; (алма), and is often translated as &quot;full of apples&quot;.
Originally it was Almatau which means Apple Mountain.

There is great genetic diversity among the wild apples in the region surrounding Almaty; the region west of the Tian Shan mountains is thought to be the apple&#x27;s ancestral home. The wild &quot;Malus sieversii&quot; is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.

== History ==

===Prehistoric Almaty===
During 1000–900 BC in the Bronze Age, the first farmers and cattle-breeders established settlements in the territory of Almaty. During the Saka period (from 700 BC to the beginning of the Christian era), these lands were occupied by the Saka and later Wusun tribes, who inhabited the territory north of the Tian Shan mountain range with evidence of these times found in the numerous burial mounds (tumuli) and ancient settlements, especially the giant burial mounds of the Saka tsars. The most famous archaeological finds have been &quot;The Golden Man&quot;, also known as &quot;The Golden Warrior&quot;, from the Issyk Kurgan; the Zhalauly treasure, the Kargaly diadem, and the Zhetysu arts bronzes (boilers, lamps, and altars). During the period of Saka and Wusun governance, Almaty became an early education center.

===15th–18th centuries===
In the 15th–18th centuries, the city was in decline as trade activities were decreasing on this part of the Silk Road. European nations were conducting more overseas trade by shipping. This period was one of crucial ethnic and political transformations.

The Dzungar invaded, dominating the Kazakh people for a period. The Kazakhs fought to protect their land and preserve independence. In 1730 the Kazakh defeated the Dzungar in the Anyrakay mountains, northwest of Almaty. The Senior Kazakh Horde (Uly Zhuz) held jurisdiction over the region. During the eighteenth century, the city and region were roughly near the border of the Khanate of Kokand. It was then absorbed as part of the Russian Empire in the 1850s.

===Foundation of Verny===

To establish its control of the region, Russia built Fort Zailiyskoe () between the Bolshaya and Malenkaya Almatinka rivers. Construction began on 4 February 1854 and was largely completed by autumn. The fort was a pentagonal wooden palisade with one side built along the Malaya Almatinka. Before the end of the year, it was renamed Fort Vernoe (, &quot;Loyal&quot;), sometimes rendered as Vyernoe at the time. The palisade was eventually replaced with a brick wall with embrasures. The fort&#x27;s main facilities were erected around the large central square for training and parading.

In 1867, the settlement around the fort was large enough that it was reorganized as the town of Almatinsk (). Before the end of the year, this was renamed Verny (, ).

On 28 May 1887, at 4 a.m., an earthquake almost totally destroyed Verny in 11–12 minutes.

By 1906 the population of the city had grown to 27,000, two-thirds of whom were Russians and Ukrainians.

On 3 January 1911 the city was almost completely destroyed with over 770 brick buildings collapsing as a result of the 1911 Kebin earthquake.

===Soviet era===
In 1918 following the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Bolshevik government, Soviet power was established in Verny. The city and the region became part of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (RSFSR). On 5 February 1921, Verny was renamed Alma-Ata, one of the city&#x27;s ancient names, by a joint consultation of regional government representatives, professional trade associations, and local faith-based groups.

In 1926, the Council of Labor and Defence approved the construction of the Turkestan–Siberia Railway that was a crucial element of the future growth of Kazakhstan, especially in the east and southeast of the region. The Turkestan–Siberia Railway construction also had a decisive economic impact that strongly influenced the destiny of Alma-Ata as the capital of the Kazakh ASSR. In 1930 the construction of the highway and railway to Alma-Ata was completed.

On 29 April 1927, the government decided to transfer the capital of the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic from Kyzyl-Orda to Alma-Ata, within the RFSFR. This attracted more trade and people working with the government, stimulating intensive development in the city.

On 31 January 1928, Leon Trotsky, leader of the 1917 October Revolution, accompanied by his wife Natalia Sedova and his son Lev Sedov, was exiled to Alma-Ata by Joseph Stalin, then head of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in Moscow. Trotsky was expelled from Alma-Ata to Turkey in February 1929 and went into exile in Mexico City.

The Alma-Ata airport was opened in 1930, opening up a direct connection from Alma-Ata to Moscow, the center of the Soviet government. Alma-Ata became the main entry by air to Kazakhstan, a status which it retains today. Transformation of this small town into the capital of the Kazakh SSR was accelerated by the large-scale construction of new administrative and government facilities and housing. The Great Purge of 1936–38 extended to Kazakhstan, where numerous intellectuals, activists, leaders, teachers and others were killed. The Soviet government dominated the population. During the 1930s Kazakh nomads suffered starvation after disruption of their traditional living patterns. (see: Asharshylyq)

In 1936 the Architecture and Planning Bureau developed a plan to enhance Alma-Ata as the new cultural capital of the Kazakh SSR. The plan was based on the existing rectangular system of districts. They were to be strengthened and reconstructed.

====World War II====
During World War II the government dramatically affected the city&#x27;s population and structures. To better organize the home front and concentrate industrial and material resources, the government evacuated 26,000 people and numerous industries from the European theatre of war. Alma-Ata hosted over 30 industrial facilities removed from the European section of the USSR, eight evacuated hospitals, 15 institutes, universities and technical schools; and around 20 cultural institutions. Motion picture production companies from Leningrad, Kyiv, and Moscow were also moved to Alma-Ata at this time. This brought in so many ethnic Russians that the Kazakhs became a minority in the region.

====Industrialization ====
During the years 1941–1945 the industrial potential of the city increased significantly. Development increased during the postwar years. The population of the city grew from 104,000 in 1919 to 365,000 in 1968. By 1967 the city had 145 enterprises, with the bulk of these being light and food industries.

The main industries in Alma-Ata were: food processing (36% of gross industrial output), based largely on locally abundant fruit and vegetable raw materials, light industry (31%), and heavy industry (33%). The main products of the region were:
* Food: Meat, flour and cereals (pasta factory), milk, wines, canned fruit, tobacco, confectionery, alcoholic spirits, beer, yeast, and tea (packaging)
* Light industry: textiles, fur, knitting, carpets, footwear, apparel, printing, and the Almaty Cotton combine.
* Heavy industry: electrical engineering, foundry engineering, car repair, bearing repair, building materials, woodworking, concrete structures and structural elements, and housebuilding.

====Urban development====

From 1966 to 1971, 1,400,000 square metres of public and cooperative housing were built. Annually, around 300,000 square metres of dwellings were under construction. Most of the buildings constructed during this time were earthquake-proof multi-story buildings. The Soviet government tried to diversify architectural forms to create a more varied cityscape. During this period, many schools, hospitals, cultural, and entertainment facilities were constructed, including Lenin&#x27;s Palace, the Kazakhstan Hotel, and the Medeo Sports Complex.

The supersonic transport Tupolev Tu-144 went into service on 26 December 1975, carrying mail and freight between Moscow and Alma-Ata in preparation for passenger services; these began in November 1977. The Aeroflot flight on 1 June 1978 was the 55th and last scheduled passenger flight of the Tu-144.

Alma-Ata was the host city for a 1978 international conference on Primary Health Care. The Alma Ata Declaration was adopted, marking a paradigm shift in global public health.

On 16 December 1986, the Jeltoqsan riot took place in the Brezhnev Square (now Republic Square) in response to General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s dismissal of Dinmukhamed Kunayev.

On 7 September 1988, the subway Almaty Metro project started construction; the subway was opened on 1 December 2011 after 23 years.

===Post-independence===
Kazakhstan declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 16 December 1991 (Kazakhstan Independence Day). On 28 January 1993, the government renamed the city from the Russian &quot;Alma-Ata&quot; to the Kazakh name &quot;Almaty&quot;. In 1997 the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev approved the decree to transfer the capital from Almaty to Astana in the north of the country. 

On 1 July 1998 a law was passed to establish the special status of Almaty as a scientific, cultural, historical, financial, and industrial centre.

The new general plan of Almaty for 2030 was released in 1998. It is intended to create ecologically safe, secure, and socially comfortable living conditions in the city. The main objective is to promote Almaty&#x27;s image as a garden-city.

It proposes continued multi-storied and single-housing development, reorganization of industrial districts or territories, improving transport infrastructure, and expanding the Almaty Metro. The first line of the Almaty metro was launched on 1 December 2011, two weeks ahead of schedule. The extension of the line to Qalqaman was opened in 2015.

Nevertheless, Almaty has developed a major problem with air pollution. Already in 1995, particulate emissions, then mostly from the city&#x27;s thermal power station, exceeded Kazakh and EU standards by over 20 times. In 2008, Almaty was ranked the 9th most polluted city in the world. A 2013 study identified cars as a major source of pollution, and it was noted since 2003 and 2013 morbidity had increased by a factor of 1.5, and that the city takes the first place in the republic on respiratory, endocrine and blood diseases, cancer and bronchial asthma, even though there are no major industrial installations. An independent local air quality monitoring system with a mobile app was launched in 2017.
The area of the city has been expanded during recent years with the annexation of the suburban settlements of Kalkaman, Kok Tobe, Gorniy Gigant District (Mountain Giant). Numerous apartment blocks and office skyscrapers have transformed the face of the town, which has been built into the mountains. Squatter settlements such as Shanyrak have resisted eviction in the face of these development plans.

Almaty was the site of a notorious terrorist attack in July 2016, when Jihadist Ruslan Kulikbayev killed eight police officers and two civilians in a shootout and car chase. Kulikbayev was wounded during the shootout and later sentenced to death for the attack.

In March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in the city. Soon, Almaty was transformed, as the pandemic led the city into a changed behavior. The government imposed lockdowns of most institutions. 

In January 2022, Almaty was plunged into unrest as part of a national political crisis.

== Administrative divisions ==
There are 8 official Almaty city districts :
    Alatau district
    Almaly district
    Auezov district
    Bostandyk district
    Jetysu district
    Medeu district
    Nauryzbay district
    Turksib district

== Geography ==
Almaty is located in south-eastern Kazakhstan, almost 1000 km from the capital Astana. Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s capital Bishkek is 190 km to the west, while Ürümqi in China is almost 1000 km east.

The region is also home to the Mynjylky mountain plateau, an elevated plain located at the source of the Malaya Almaatinka river at an altitude of 3000 meters above sea level.

=== Climate ===
Almaty has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfa&quot;) with hot summers and cold winters. It is characterized by the influence of mountain–valley circulation. This is especially evident in the northern part of the city, located directly in the transition zone of the mountain slopes to the plains.

Annual average air temperature is equal to , the coldest month is January, (on average), the warmest month (July) (on average). In average years frost starts on about 14 October and ends on about 18 April, with sustained extreme cold from about 19 December to about 23 February, a period of about 67 days. Weather with temperature above is average for about 36 days a year. In the center of Almaty, like any large city, there is a heat island. Therefore, frost in the city center starts about 7 days later and finishes 3 days earlier than in the northern suburbs. Annual precipitation is about . April and May are the wettest months, during which about a third of the city&#x27;s annual precipitation is received.

It is not uncommon to see snow or a cold snap hitting Almaty as late as the end of May. For example, in the last quarter century, such snowfalls were recorded on 13 May 1985, 1 May 1989, 5 May 1993 and 18 May 1998. The record latest snowfall in Almaty was on 17 June 1987.

Almaty sometimes experiences winter rain, despite heavy preceding snowfall and low temperatures. The most memorable winter rain took place on 16 December 1996 during a military parade to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Independence of the Republic.

Almaty Weather Station&#x27;s GM mostly records south-easterly wind (30%), its resistance increases during the summer (37%) and falls in winter (19%). Wind speeds exceed 15 m/s on about 15 days a year, on average.
===Seismic activity in the territory of Kazakhstan===

Industrially developed and densely populated areas in the south and southeast of Kazakhstan are situated in the zones where the maximum magnitudes of expected earthquakes are from 6.0 to 8.3 (the intensity of I0=8–10).

The south seismic active zone of Kazakhstan is a part of the North Tian-Shan ridge system. The main city of Almaty is located near the Zailiski Alatau mountain base. In recorded history prior to the late 19th century, three catastrophic earthquakes are known to have taken place there. The following are the dates of occurrence and extracts from the historical chronicles of the times:

* 1770, &quot;...Belovodka village was buried&quot;;
* 1807, &quot;a horrible catastrophe took place in Almaty&quot;;
* 1865, strong earthquake.

Within the past 125 years, three more strong destructive earthquakes occurred here, with centres not more than from the current city location. Their magnitudes were 9 and 11 on the MSK scale – 64, and their centres were located within . Centres were located in a south and south–east directions:
* (1887 y., K=17.14) Vernenskoe
* (1889 y., K=19.12) Chilik
* (1911 y., K=18.76) Keminskoe

K – indicates the energy of the earthquake.

In each of these earthquakes, the city suffered wide destruction.

The Territory of the Kyrgyz State adjoins North Tian-Shan.

==Culture==
Almaty is largely considered to be the heart and soul of Kazakhstan&#x27;s classical and popular cultures. The Almaty Region and the city itself have a distinct character and pace compared to other regions and cities in Kazakhstan. Contemporary Almaty has a more European character due to more cafes and restaurants with outdoor seating and public green space. Almaty is the historical and contemporary capital of intellectualism in Kazakhstan as a product of Almaty&#x27;s location along the ancient Silk Road, and because many Russian intellectuals were exiled to the region. The Abai Kazakh State Opera and Ballet Theatre has anchored the city&#x27;s theater scene since 1934 and was founded around a community of local performance artists. The Kasteyev State Museum of Arts was founded in 1935, is the largest museum in Kazakhstan, and has the largest collection of artworks by Kazakh classic and contemporary artists. The wild apple &quot;Malus sieversii&quot; is generally accepted as having first emerged in the Almaty area, and it significantly figures in Almaty&#x27;s culture.

=== Theaters ===

Theatrical art began to develop in the city of Verny a few years after the construction of the Russian fort. On 21 November 1872, the Society of Dramatic Art Lovers staged the first production in the city: A. N. Ostrovsky&#x27;s play, &quot;Stay in Your Own Sled&quot;. Later, plays were performed at public, military, and commercial gatherings. An abridgement of Glinka&#x27;s opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; was the first opera staged in the city, by the Kolpakovsky three-year city school on 23 February 1913 at the Commercial Assembly, to commemorate the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty.

The flowering of theatrical art in the city began during the Soviet period of Alma-Ata, resulting from the transfer of the capital of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic from Kyzylorda to Alma-Ata. Thus, the Kazakh Drama Theater, the first Kazakh professional theater, moved to the city. In the 1930s, the Opera and Ballet Theater (1934) and the Puppet Theater (1935) were established in the city. Also, theater companies founded in different cities of the republic began to move to the capital: the Russian Drama Theater (moved from Semipalatinsk in 1934), the Uyghur Musical Comedy Theater (from Chilik, 1962), the Korean Musical Comedy Theater (from Kyzylorda, 1968), and the German Drama Theater (from Temirtau, 1989).

After Kazakhstan regained independence in 1991, a large number of new independent theaters appeared in the city. Often these are modern youth concert venues created by enthusiasts. They face funding problems, as maintaining a permanent theater company is costly.

=== Museums ===

A significant contribution to the study of the history of culture, ethnography of southern Kazakhs in the late 19th–20th centuries was made by Turkestan scientists and local historians, united around the scientific societies and cultural and educational institutions of Tashkent. In 1874, from the private collections of travelers who visited Semirechye with a scientific and regional purpose and with the help of the local intelligentsia, a museum was first created in the city of Verny, which was later transformed into a village museum of the Semirechye Cossack Host. This date is the day of the foundation of the first museum in Semirechye. The foundation of the A. Kasteev Museum of Arts was laid by the Kazakh State Art Gallery named after T.G. Shevchenko, founded in 1935. Its main tasks were to collect the best works of Kazakh artists and organize their creative business trips.
In 1936, museums in Moscow and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) donated a significant number of paintings, graphics, sculpture and applied art to the gallery. By the end of the 1950s, the gallery&#x27;s funds numbered over 5,000 exhibits, including paintings, reproductions of works by pre-revolutionary and Soviet artists, Western European and Eastern masters of art. In the 1970s and 1980s, new buildings were built for existing museums, and new thematic museums were opened: books, musical instruments, archeology, and others. A significant contribution to the development of the museum business was the opening of the Museum of the History of Almaty, which created an association of museums in the city of Almaty and the state institution &quot;Gylym Ordasy&quot;, which united 4 museums, which allows to systematize scientific work.

=== Cinemas ===
The first film screening in the city of Verny took place in 1900, when the physicist K.O. Krause arrived in the city. On it, hand-painted glass transparencies were demonstrated with the help of an overhead projector. The film show took place on 25 January in the Pushkin Garden. In January 1911, the building of the first private cinema &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; was opened at the intersection of Pushkin and Gogol streets, which belonged to the entrepreneur A. R. Seifullin. For the demonstration of films, the cinema was equipped with the first power plant in the history of the city, produced by the British company &quot;Petter&quot;, with 14 horsepower. The cinema building burned down in February 1918. Starting in the 1930s, summer cinemas began to appear in the parks of the city, which were later transformed into full-fledged cinemas. Thus, the Rodina Cinema was first opened in the Central Park in 1937. In 1957, it was rebuilt from a seasonal venue into a wide-screen cinema with an auditorium for 712 seats. In another park of the city, the Park of the Federation of Soviet Republics, the Progress Cinema was opened, later renamed Alma-Ata. By the early 1990s, there were 21 cinemas in the city. All cinemas were divided into first, second and third screens. The cinemas of the first screen, in which the premieres of new films took place, were &quot;Alatau&quot;, &quot;Tselinny&quot; and &quot;Arman&quot;. Film films arrived at the cinemas of the third screen in a deplorable state, with glues and cuts. That is, the quality of showing the film depended on the screening of the cinema. Cinemas in the city were single-screen, two halls were owned by the cinema centers &quot;Kazakhstan&quot;, &quot;Arman&quot; and &quot;Tselinny&quot;. In the 2000s, cinemas began to open in shopping and entertainment centers, and as a result, existing stationary cinemas began to lose popularity and close.

==Economy==

Almaty generates approximately 20% of Kazakhstan&#x27;s GDP (or $36 billion in 2010). The city accounts for about 20% of government revenues and 60% of bank credits. The nation is the most powerful economically in Central Asia and Almaty is a key financial center. It is considered to be a Beta- Global City as of the 2012 GaWC study.

One of the largest industries in Almaty is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to Kazakhstan&#x27;s balance of payments. Almaty is home to Halyk Bank, which is the largest bank in Central Asia, Kaspi Bank, and other major banks. The Kazakhstan Stock Exchange is based in Almaty.

Almaty is also developing as a regional financial and business centre (RFCA).

Under construction is the &#x27;Almaty Financial District and Esentai Park&#x27;. This was designed by T.J. Gottesdiener, who designed both 7 World Trade Center in New York City and Tokyo Midtown. Its goal is to become the largest business centre in Central Asia. Esentai Tower, a 37-floor building in the park, is the tallest mixed-use building in Kazakhstan, housing offices of companies such as Ernst &amp; Young, HSBC and Credit Suisse. The first Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Kazakhstan opened in 2013 in Esentai Tower.

Along with professional services, media companies are concentrated in Almaty. The media distribution industry has been growing rapidly since 2006. Major broadcasting channels KTK and NTK are based in Almaty, as are several national newspapers.

There are plans to construct a Western Europe-Western China highway, passing through Almaty. A new airport in Almaty expects to handle about 45 million tonnes of cargo each year. Air Astana is headquartered in the Air Astana Centre 1 in Almaty. Prior to their dissolution, Air Kazakhstan and Kazakhstan Airlines were also headquartered in Almaty.

The economy of Almaty and Almaty Region continues to grow, and is expected to increase by nearly 6.5 percent per year until 2020. To mitigate the rapidly increasing electricity demand caused by this growth, the Kazakh authorities decided to upgrade the power system by building the new transmission line and modernizing the substations. The Alma Transmission Project, supported by the World Bank, has helped achieve this goal.

==Cityscape==
In 1854, the Tsarist government built a military fortification on the left bank of the Almaty River. The construction was supervised by Major Peremyshelsky and engineer-lieutenant Aleksandrovsky. By the autumn of the same year, construction work was completed. With their arrival, the area of Almaty began to develop rapidly, and a few prominent buildings were constructed during this time including the Little Stanitsa and the Tatar Slobodka. A major earthquake in 1887 destroyed 1798 brick houses and killed 322 people. After the earthquake, numerous notable buildings were constructed including the House of the Regiment of Military Assembly (1908), Ascension Cathedral, the House of Public Assembly, and others. Paul Gourdet, who is credited for most of Almaty&#x27;s urban architecture of the time, used an approach to design Russian Revival architecture, which is evident in some of his designs including the Medical College, the Voznesensky Cathedral, the merchant Shakhvorostov&#x27;s house, the former Women&#x27;s College, the former City Orphanage, and numerous other buildings. Andrei Zenkov is another prominent architect and major contributor to some of Almaty&#x27;s most notable buildings. At the time, Zenkov was in charge of the construction projects of the Semirechye regional government.

From 1966 to 1972, most of the buildings constructed during the era were earthquake-proof multi-story housing blocks. During this period, many schools, hospitals, cultural, and entertainment facilities were constructed in post-modernist style, including Lenin&#x27;s Palace (now Palace of the Republic, 1970), Hotel Kazakhstan (1977) and the Medeu (1971).

=== Attractions ===
====Churches====

* St. Sophia Cathedral (Almaty)
* The Ascension Cathedral is a 56 m high earthquake-resistant structure, built by the architect K. A. Borisoglebsky and engineer A. P. Zenkov in 1907 from blue Tien Shan spruce. It withstood an earthquake with a force of 10 points in 1911. The walls of the cathedral were painted by the local artist N. Khludov. During the Soviet period, the building housed a local history museum. In May 1995, the building was transferred to the Almaty and Semipalatinsk Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church. After two years of restoration work, services were resumed in the church in 1997.

====Fountains====
According to the city&#x27;s Department of Natural Resources and Resource Use Management, the city had 125 fountains. Among them is the &quot;Oriental Calendar&quot; Fountain, whose 12 sculptural figures represent the 12 animals of the Kazakh 12-year animal cycle (similar to its Chinese counterpart).

There are now more than 120 fountains in Almaty, 61 of which are communally owned. Fountains, together with an extensive irrigation ditch network, play a big role in Alma-Ata – together they create a single complex of reservoirs and watercourses of the city. Every year at the end of spring, the city celebrates the &quot;Day of Fountains&quot; holiday where for the first time after winter, all the city&#x27;s fountains are turned on. In 2006, a new fountain was opened on Lake Sayran. Previously, the highest fountain in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) gushed from this lake – a stream of water 10 cm in diameter reached a height of 50 meters. The fountain has been closed since 2008.

<text>Atyrau (, ; , ; ), known until 1991 as Guryev (), is a city in Kazakhstan and the capital of Atyrau Region. Atyrau is a transcontinental city, at the mouth of the Ural River on the Caspian Sea, between Europe and Asia, west of Almaty and east of the Russian city of Astrakhan.

Atyrau is famous for its oil and gas industries. It has a population of 355,117 as of 2020. It is predominantly made up of Kazakhs, the minorities being Russians, Koreans, Tatars and Uzbeks.

==History==
The wooden fort at the mouth of the Yaik River was founded in 1645 as &quot;Nizhny Yaitzky gorodok&quot; (literally, &quot;Lower Yaik Fort&quot;) by the Russian trader Gury Nazarov, a native of Yaroslavl, who specialized in trade with Khiva and Bukhara. The fort was plundered by the Yaik Cossacks, leading the Guriev family to rebuild it in stone (1647–62). Tsar Alexis sent a garrison of Streltsy to protect the fort from Cossack incursions. Despite these efforts, the Cossack rebel Stepan Razin held the town in 1667 and 1668. The fort gradually lost its strategic significance and was demolished in 1810. Between 1708 and 1992 the city was known as &quot;Guriev&quot;. The Kazakh name &quot;Atyrau&quot; means &#x27;river delta&#x27;.

Two parts of the world have the city. The side of Samarskaya (right side of the river) lies in Europe and the left bank of Bukharskaya is in Asia. It was established in 1615, by the employer Mikhail Guriev, who applied the decree to tzar Mikhail Fedorovich for a monopoly in the mouth of Ural to fish sturgeons.
== Origin of the name ==
Murzaev E. Dictionary of popular geographical terms (1984) states:
:&quot;The branched coast of a large lake or sea, on which appeared the bay and islands, the estuaries of rivers and capes. The north-eastern coast of the Caspian Sea, including its alyp, the locals still call Atyrau.&quot;

A. Nurmaganbetov and M. Khobdabayev states:
:&quot;The word atyrau, which earlier means &quot;island&quot;, also grasps the concept of the word saga -&quot; the mouth of the river, &quot;and this is natural, whatever the river, at the point where it enters the ocean or the sea, its mouth branches out, and between each branch appears dry We think that this is the main reason for joint use of Atyrau together with the &quot;mouth of the river&quot;.
Ecological Kazakh–Russian Dictionary (2001) states:
:Atyrau is a tract, a cane shoal in the mouth of the Urals.

==Geography==
Atyrau (together with Aktau) is Kazakhstan&#x27;s main harbour city on the Caspian Sea, Atyrau at the delta of the Ural River. Atyrau city is approximately below sea level. The city is considered to be located both in Asia and Europe, as it is divided by the Ural River.
The city is a hub for the oil-rich Caspian Depression; because of this, many oil wells have been drilled in the Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field areas. An oil pipeline runs from Atyrau to Samara, where it joins the Russian pipeline system. A separate oil pipeline runs from the Tengiz field to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.
==Demographics==

==History==

Petropavlovsk was founded in the summer of 1752 as a military fortress of Saint Peter and is located on the site of the Kyzyl-Zhar tract, on the right bank of the Ishim river. Initially, it was considered a military outpost and was a major trading center in the North of the Kazakh khanate.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Kazakh khanate was formed on the territory of modern Kazakhstan, consisting of three zhuzs. Each of them had common routes of nomads and a common territory. The middle zhuz of the Kazakhs, consisting of the Argyn, Kerey, Kongrat and Naiman tribes, occupied the Northern, North-Eastern and Central parts of Kazakhstan. Their main occupation was nomadic and semi-nomadic cattle breeding.

In the middle of the 17th century, the Kazakh-Dzungar Wars began. During the war for their lands, the Kazakhs were forced to migrate to the southern steppes. In this regard, in the 17th century and at the beginning of the 18th century, in Northern Kazakhstan, the nomadic population is rare. In the 18th century, the war for the return of Northern Kazakhstan continued. The southern part of the steppes and areas of North-Eastern Kazakhstan became the battleground of the Kazakhs and Dzungars.

At this time, the Kazakh khans decided to accept Russian citizenship: the Younger zhuz took citizenship in 1731 and later in 1740, the middle zhuz took citizenship. In the steppe, defensive fortifications were built, among these fortifications was the fortress of St. Peter.

===Within the Russian Empire===

Map of the Tobolsk Viceroyalty, 1792. The fortress of St. Petra in the southern part.
In 1752, during the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna, the Senate, in order to strengthen the southern borders of the Russian Empire, recognized the need to urgently begin construction of a new Ishim line. By a decree of the Senate of February 25, 1752, General Kinderman was ordered to build a line of fortifications from the Omsk fortress on the Irtysh to the Beast&#x27;s Head tract on Tobol. 
In June 1752, an expedition consisting of Dragoons of the Lutsk regiment, foot soldiers of the Noteburg regiment and a battalion of the Vologda Dragoon regiment, almost 2 thousand people, moved to the tract on the Ishim river. A small forest, nestled up against the floodplain of lake Babalawo Dragoons crossed to the right Bank of the Ishim river. Two steep ravines that bounded the construction site, went to the Ishim and together with the steep Bank of a wide (up to 47 m) river created a natural barrier to the enemy. The expedition had to build a large fortification in a short time — the fortress of St. Petersburg. Peter and two small-fortress Noon and Swan, and between them 8 redoubts. Given the imminent onset of cold weather, we decided to build wooden fortifications.

The fortress on Ishim had the shape of a regular hexagon with an area of about 2 hectares. At the corners of its equal distance located the bastions connected by curtain walls. The bastions facing the river were called Nagorny and Ishim. The total length of the fortress fence was more than 1.3 km. In the bastions were placed guns, inside the fortress-barracks, stables, officers &#x27; houses, garrison Church, powder magazine, and other premises. Hard work exhausted the soldiers and Cossacks, as well as poor nutrition and early cold weather. People got sick, many died, and escapes became more frequent.

In early October, snow fell and work was stopped. In addition to the officers, 50 Dragoons and 40 soldiers remained in the fortress. In severe winter conditions, a small garrison provided constant surveillance of the steppe, watching for signs of distress from nearby redoubts. The fortress was connected with Russia by a chain of post stations. In the spring of 1753, construction resumed.

The area of the fortress was soon built up to the limit, and some rooms were built outside the walls of the fortress. So, later formed the Upper forstadt-on the mountain, and in the Foothills-the Lower forstadt. Forstadt is a settlement where the main role is played by the fortress and the military. In the Lower forstadt there is a Cossack village, a hospital, and a locksmith&#x27;s shop. For security reasons, the suburb was surrounded by a fence. The entrance and exit were guarded by special guards.

As well as other fortified points in Siberia, the fortress of SV. Petra was strengthened militarily: the garrison was increased, wooden walls and bastions were replaced with earthen ones. The barracks were rebuilt, and a &quot;salt house&quot; was built to receive representatives of Kokand. According to the instructions of the Senate, kolodniki exiled to Siberia for hard labor (up to 100–300) were used for the work. In 1772, the fortress had two suburbs: the upland part and the foothills. The merchant class grew, as the fortress became a major political and economic center of the priishimye region.

Thanks to Abylai Khan, the fortress became a major point of exchange and transit trade, which influenced the economic development of the steppe. Trade routes from Russia and Central Asia converged here.

Local Kazakhs borrowed from immigrants skills of mowing, tillage, fisheries, veterinary medicine, etc.

In 1782, in the fortress of St. In the presence of the Governor-General of the Ufa and Simbirsk governorates, I. V. Yakobi, the Sultan of the Middle Zhuz, Vali Khan, took the solemn oath of allegiance to the Russian government.He was officially confirmed as a Khan by the Russian Empire.

In 1807, the fortress was renamed the city of Petropavlovsk with the addition of Tobolsk province. On September 7, the first mayor of the fortress was appointed. Peter (retired major Levashov with a salary of 300 rubles).

By a nominal decree of January 22, 1822 &quot;on the division of the Siberian provinces into Western and Eastern administrations&quot;, Siberia was divided into Western (center — Tobolsk) and Eastern (center — Irkutsk). Petropavlovsk was classified as a medium-sized city and became a district city of the newly formed Omsk region, assigned to the Western main administration.

In 1824, the Petropavlovsk district of the Omsk region was formed with the administrative center in Petropavlovsk, where offices were opened. In 1825, the city government was organized. In the same year, the first city budget was drawn up and the first city head was appointed, which was the merchant F. Zenkov.

On April 16, 1838, Petropavlovsk was made a minor city of Ishimsky uyezd of Tobolsk province, since the Omsk region was abolished.

In 1868, on November 4, when the Akmola region was formed (it existed in 1868–1919) with the center in Omsk, Petropavlovsk became a district city in this region.

During the war with Napoleon, citizens and peasants twice sent recruits and voluntarily donated about 30 thousand rubles to the defense of the Fatherland.

On May 11, 1849, a fire broke out, destroying 450 houses. After that, the new construction began according to the plan approved by the Tsar. The author of the plan was the architect Chernenko, who did not take into account the features of the soil and terrain, and the Foothills more than once sank in spring floods. The relocation of peasants from European Russia and the construction of the Siberian railway contributed to the development of the city.

Petropavlovsk oil production supplied oil to St. Petersburg, Moscow, Riga, revel, Odesa, Samara, Vladivostok, as well as to England, Germany and Denmark. The largest were the Zenkov brothers &#x27; tannery, and the factory for processing the intestines of the Swiss Accola. According to the census of 1897, there were 20014 people living in Petropavlovsk[the source is not specified 3714 days]. Accounted for the bulk of Russians, Kazakhs, there were about 1500 people. A significant group were the Tatars-immigrants. According to the source &quot;Cities of Russia in 1910&quot; St. Petersburg, 1914 in 1910, 37,973 people lived in Petropavlovsk, including by national composition: Russians — 72.8%, Turkish-Tatars — 25.2%, poles — 0.5%, Jews-1.1%, Germans-0.2%, Finns-0.2 %.

For a long time, a distinctive feature of the city remained the low level of improvement, lack of Sewerage, cluttered streets, unsanitary condition of bazaars and slaughterhouses, which contributed to the spread of diseases. The city had one hospital with 10 beds. By 1900, there were 13 educational institutions in the city, including one fifth-grade school, one women&#x27;s gymnasium, two parochial schools, one parish school, two village schools, and six Tatar schools. The largest enterprise in the city was a cannery, built in 1915, which employed 100 people. There were nine mosques in the city, of which six were made of stone.

In 1896, the Petropavlovsk railway station of the South Ural railway was built near the city as part of the TRANS-Siberian railway.

===In Soviet period===
In 1918, Petropavlovsk became one of the centers of the white movement. On may 31, the Siberian Cossacks of chief V. I. Volkov, with the support of the Czechoslovaks, overthrew the Soviet government. Colonel Pankratov became the commandant of the city. The ideological justification for the resistance was the support of the Constituent Assembly COSSACKS PRIISHIMJE AT the BEGINNING of the CIVIL WAR (summer 1918). During the Peter and Paul operation of the 5th army on October 31, 1919, Soviet power was restored in the city.

In 1919–1921. Petropavlovsk is a district city in the Omsk province of the RSFSR.

On August 26, 1920, the decree of the Central Executive Committee and the SNK of the RSFSR on the formation of the Autonomous Kyrgyz Republic (1920-1925), later the Cossack ASSR, was signed. Then four uyezds of the Omsk province of the RSFSR (existed in 1919–1925) (Atbasar, Akmolinsky, Kokchetavsky and Petropavlovsk) temporarily remained under the jurisdiction of the Sibrevkom until the final decision of the Extraordinary authorized Commission of the Kaztsik on the reception of this territory. The commission had two main tasks. First, to prepare the conditions for the implementation of administrative reform, as a result of which Petropavlovsk from a district city was to become the administrative center of the Akmola province. Secondly, to establish the borders of this province with other provinces of the RSFSR. On April 26, 1921, the resolution of the Extraordinary authorized Commission of Kaztsik on the admission and organization of the Akmola province with the administrative center in the city of Petropavlovsk was issued.

From April 26, 1921, to January 17, 1928, Petropavlovsk was the administrative center of the Akmola province of the Kirghiz (from 1925 — Kazak) ASSR, which existed in 1920-1928[20].

From January 17, 1928, to May 10, 1928, Petropavlovsk was the administrative center of the Kyzyl-Zhar district of the Kazakh ASSR.

From May 10, 1928, to December 17, 1930, Petropavlovsk was the administrative center of the Petropavlovsk district of the Cossack ASSR.

From December 17, 1930, to March 10, 1932, Petropavlovsk was directly controlled by the Republican government of the Cossack ASSR.

1932–36 years. Petropavlovsk is the administrative center of the Karaganda region of the Kazakh ASSR.

From 1936, Petropavlovsk has been the regional center of the established North Kazakhstan region within the Kazakh SSR and since 1991 the Republic of Kazakhstan.

In 1941, when the USSR was invaded by the Axis Powers during World War II, many factories producing heavy machinery were evacuated to the east. Many factories, such as the V. I. Lenin Plant, the S. M. Kirov Plant, and the V. V. Kuibyshev Plant, were built in Petropavlovsk to manufacture heavy equipment for the war, i.e. tanks, armored personnel carriers, and so on. Today, the remaining factories mostly produce and assemble small equipment.

===As Part of an Independent Kazakhstan===
When Kazakhstan gained its independence, Petropavlovsk, which is the Russian Exonym for the city, was mostly replaced in official circles by Petropavl.

In 2008, Petropavl took part in the contest &quot;The Best City in the CIS&quot;, where it was awarded three grants, including the grant &quot;For The Preservation of Historical and Cultural Heritage&quot;.

In 2014, the trolleybus system which formerly ran in the city was abolished.

On November 27, 2018, the rural localities of Kuibyshevskoye village, Novopavlovka village, Teplovskoye village, and Stop point 2629 located on the territory of the city akimat of Petropavl were incorporated directly into the city of Petropavl.

==Education==
There are 43 organizations of preschool education, 38 secondary schools, 13 colleges, 5 higher educational institutions in Petropavlovsk.

==Culture==
===Theatres===
The Main Theatre in Petropavl is named after the Kazakh writer Sabit Mukanov, and performances are given in the Kazakh language. Viewers without knowledge of Kazakh are given headphones which serve to translate the performance into Russian, making it accessible to the many Non-Kazakh-Speakers living in Petropavl.

Petropavl&#x27;s regional puppet theatre has been operating since February 1991. It is located in a building on 69 Vasilieva street. In addition to children&#x27;s performances, it is used to show films and hold new year&#x27;s matinees.

The Theatre has been named after the Soviet playwright Nikolai Fyodorovich Pogodin, who was awarded the prestigious Lenin Prize in 1986. Children&#x27;s&#x27; performances are held in the morning, while adults&#x27; performances are held in the evening. The Theatre also has a studio for aspiring young actors.

===Museums===
The North Kazakhstan regional museum of local history opened in 1924. In the hall of the Museum there is a large map of the North Caucasus-on the entire wall. In the Museum you can see objects of antiquity and modernity. The flora and fauna of the North Caucasus region is very richly represented on the first floor in the form of stuffed animals against the background of their natural habitat.

There are military items, a yurt, Kazakh national clothing, and a department dedicated to former president Nursultan Nazarbayev.

The North Kazakhstan regional museum of fine arts opened in 1989. The Museum has permanent exhibitions, sometimes exhibitions are held. For example, an exhibition of the artist Krestnikov&#x27;s drawings as a child.

The North Kazakhstan regional Philharmonic society was opened in 1965 on the basis of the concert and variety Bureau of the city Palace of culture.

==Transportation==
Petropavl has a railway station with connections to the Russian capital Moscow and Kazakhstan&#x27;s capital Astana.

Petropavl Airport is located south of the city.

==Sports==
The city&#x27;s bandy team in the Spartakiade 2009 on home ice was victorious. In 2013 it was hosted in Petropavl again, this time the team from Khromtau won. 12–17 December 2016 the Kazakh Cup, to the memory of Kazbek Baybulov, was played at Stadium Karasay in Petropavl. The home team Volna captured the bronze medal.

Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist Alexander Vinokourov is a native of nearby Bishkul.

==Twin Town – Sister City==

Petropavl is twinned with:

<text>In mathematics, a diffeology on a set generalizes the concept of smooth charts in a differentiable manifold, by declaring what constitutes the &quot;smooth parametrizations&quot; into the set.

The concept was first introduced by Jean-Marie Souriau in the 1980s under the name &quot;Espace différentiel&quot; and later developed by his students Paul Donato and Patrick Iglesias. A related idea was introduced by Kuo-Tsaï Chen (陳國才, &quot;Chen Guocai&quot;) in the 1970s, using convex sets instead of open sets for the domains of the plots.

== Intuitive definition ==
Recall that a topological manifold is a topological space which is locally homeomorphic to formula_1. Differentiable manifolds (also called smooth manifolds) generalize the notion of smoothness on formula_1 in the following sense: a differentiable manifold is a topological manifold with a differentiable atlas, i.e. a collection of maps from open subsets of formula_1 to the manifold which are used to &quot;pull back&quot; the differential structure from formula_1 to the manifold.

A diffeological space consists of a set together with a collection of maps (called a diffeology) satisfying suitable axioms, which are used to characterize smoothness of the space in a way similar to charts of an atlas.

A smooth manifold can be equivalently defined as a diffeological space which is locally diffeomorphic to formula_1. But there are many diffeological spaces which do not carry any local model, nor a sufficiently interesting underlying topological space. Diffeology is therefore suitable to treat examples of objects more general than manifolds.

==Formal definition==
A diffeology on a set &quot;formula_6&quot; consists of a collection of maps, called plots or parametrizations, from open subsets of formula_1 (for all &quot;formula_8&quot;) to &quot;formula_6&quot; such that the following axioms hold:

* Covering axiom: every constant map is a plot.
* Locality axiom: for a given map &quot;formula_10&quot;, if every point in &quot;formula_11&quot; has a neighborhood &quot;formula_12&quot; such that &quot;formula_13&quot; is a plot, then &quot;formula_14&quot; itself is a plot.
* Smooth compatibility axiom: if &quot;formula_15&quot; is a plot, and &quot;formula_14&quot; is a smooth function from an open subset of some formula_17 into the domain of &quot;formula_15&quot;, then the composite &quot;formula_19&quot; is a plot.
Note that the domains of different plots can be subsets of formula_1 for different values of &quot;formula_21&quot;; in particular, any diffeology contains the elements of its underlying set as the plots with &quot;formula_22&quot;. A set together with a diffeology is called a diffeological space.

More abstractly, a diffeological space is a concrete sheaf on the site of open subsets of formula_1, for all &quot;formula_8&quot;, and open covers.

=== Morphisms ===
A map between diffeological spaces is called smooth if and only if its composite with any plot of the first space is a plot of the second space. It is called a diffeomorphism if it is smooth, bijective, and its inverse is also smooth. By construction, given a diffeological space &quot;formula_6&quot;, its plots defined on &quot;formula_11&quot; are precisely all the smooth maps from &quot;formula_11&quot; to &quot;formula_6&quot;.

Diffeological spaces form a category where the morphisms are smooth maps. The category of diffeological spaces is closed under many categorical operations: for instance, it is Cartesian closed, complete and cocomplete, and more generally it is a quasitopos.

=== D-topology ===
Any diffeological space is automatically a topological space with the so-called D-topology: the final topology such that all plots are continuous (with respect to the euclidean topology on formula_1).

In other words, a subset formula_30 is open if and only if formula_31 is open for any plot formula_14 on formula_6. Actually, the D-topology is completely determined by smooth curves, i.e. a subset formula_30 is open if and only if formula_35 is open for any smooth map formula_36.

The D-topology is automatically locally path-connected and a differentiable map between diffeological spaces is automatically continuous between their D-topologies.

=== Additional structures ===
A Cartan-De Rham calculus can be developed in the framework of diffeologies, as well as a suitable adaptation of the notions of fiber bundles, homotopy, etc. However, there is not a canonical definition of tangent spaces and tangent bundles for diffeological spaces.

==Examples==

=== Trivial examples ===

* Any set can be endowed with the coarse (or trivial, or indiscrete) diffeology, i.e. the largest possible diffeology (any map is a plot). The corresponding D-topology is the trivial topology.
*Any set can be endowed with the discrete (or fine) diffeology, i.e. the smallest possible diffeology (the only plots are the locally constant maps). The corresponding D-topology is the discrete topology.
*Any topological space can be endowed with the continuous diffeology, whose plots are all continuous maps.

=== Manifolds ===

Any differentiable manifold formula_37 can be assigned the diffeology consisting of all smooth maps from all open subsets of Euclidean spaces into it. This diffeology will contain not only the charts of formula_37, but also all smooth curves into formula_37, all constant maps (with domains open subsets of Euclidean spaces), etc. The D-topology recovers the original manifold topology. With this diffeology, a map between two smooth manifolds is smooth in the usual sense if and only if it is smooth in the diffeological sense. Accordingly, smooth manifolds with smooth maps form a full subcategory of the category of diffeological spaces.

This procedure similarly assigns diffeologies to other spaces that possess a smooth structure that is determined by a local model. More precisely, each of the examples below form a full subcategory of diffeological spaces.
* Orbifolds, which are modeled on quotient spaces formula_40, for formula_41 is a finite linear subgroup, and smooth maps between them.
*Manifolds with boundary or corners, which are modeled on orthants, and smooth maps between them.
*Banach manifolds, which are modeled on Banach spaces, and smooth maps between them.
*Fréchet manifolds, which are modeled on Fréchet spaces, and smooth maps between them.

===Constructions from other diffeological spaces===

* If a set &quot;formula_6&quot; is given two different diffeologies, their intersection is a diffeology on &quot;formula_6&quot;, called the intersection diffeology, which is finer than both starting diffeologies. The D-topology of the intersection diffeology is the intersection of the D-topologies of the initial diffeologies.
* If &quot;formula_44&quot; is a subset of the diffeological space &quot;formula_6&quot;, then the subspace diffeology on &quot;formula_44&quot; is the diffeology consisting of the plots of &quot;formula_6&quot; whose images are subsets of &quot;formula_44&quot;. The D-topology of &quot;formula_44&quot; is equal to the subspace topology of the D-topology of &quot;formula_6&quot; if &quot;formula_44&quot; is open, but may be finer in general.
* If &quot;formula_6&quot; and &quot;formula_44&quot; are diffeological spaces, then the product diffeology on the Cartesian product &quot;formula_54&quot; is the diffeology generated by all products of plots of &quot;formula_6&quot; and of &quot;formula_44&quot;. The D-topology of &quot;formula_54&quot; is the coarsest delta-generated topology containing the product topology of the D-topologies of &quot;formula_6&quot; and &quot;formula_44&quot;; it is equal to the product topology when &quot;formula_6&quot; or &quot;formula_44&quot; is locally compact, but may be finer in general.
* If &quot;formula_6&quot; is a diffeological space and &quot;formula_63&quot; is an equivalence relation on &quot;formula_6&quot;, then the quotient diffeology on the quotient set &quot;formula_6&quot;/~ is the diffeology generated by all compositions of plots of &quot;formula_6&quot; with the projection from &quot;formula_6&quot; to &quot;formula_68&quot;. The D-topology on &quot;formula_68&quot; is the quotient topology of the D-topology of &quot;formula_6&quot; (note that this topology may be trivial without the diffeology being trivial).
* The pushforward diffeology of a diffeological space &quot;formula_6&quot; by a function &quot;formula_72&quot; is the diffeology on &quot;formula_44&quot; generated by the compositions &quot;formula_74&quot;, for &quot;formula_15&quot; a plot of &quot;formula_6&quot;. In other words, the pushforward diffeology is the smallest diffeology on &quot;formula_44&quot; making &quot;formula_14&quot; differentiable. The quotient diffeology boils down to the pushforward diffeology by the projection &quot;formula_79&quot;.
* The pullback diffeology of a diffeological space &quot;formula_44&quot; by a function &quot;formula_72&quot; is the diffeology on &quot;formula_6&quot; whose plots are maps &quot;formula_15&quot; such that the composition &quot;formula_74&quot; is a plot of &quot;formula_44&quot;. In other words, the pullback diffeology is the smallest diffeology on &quot;formula_6&quot; making &quot;formula_14&quot; differentiable.
* The functional diffeology between two diffeological spaces formula_88 is the diffeology on the set formula_89 of differentiable maps, whose plots are the maps formula_90 such that formula_91 is smooth (with respect to the product diffeology of formula_92). When &quot;formula_6&quot; and &quot;formula_44&quot; are manifolds, the D-topology of formula_89 is the smallest locally path-connected topology containing the weak topology.

=== Wire/spaghetti diffeology ===
The wire diffeology (or spaghetti diffeology) on formula_96 is the diffeology whose plots factor locally through formula_97. More precisely, a map formula_98 is a plot if and only if for every formula_99 there is an open neighbourhood formula_100 of formula_101 such that formula_102 for two plots formula_103 and formula_104. This diffeology does not coincide with the standard diffeology on formula_96: for instance, the identity formula_106 is not a plot in the wire diffeology.

This example can be enlarged to diffeologies whose plots factor locally through formula_107. More generally, one can consider the rank-formula_108-restricted diffeology on a smooth manifold formula_37: a map formula_110 is a plot if and only if the rank of its differential is less or equal than formula_108. For formula_112 one recovers the wire diffeology.

=== Other examples ===
* Quotients gives an easy way to construct non-manifold diffeologies. For example, the set of real numbers formula_97 is a smooth manifold. The quotient formula_114, for some irrational &quot;formula_115&quot;, called irrational torus, is a diffeological space diffeomorphic to the quotient of the regular 2-torus formula_116 by a line of slope &quot;formula_115&quot;. It has a non-trivial diffeology, but its D-topology is the trivial topology.
*Combining the subspace diffeology and the functional diffeology, one can define diffeologies on the space of sections of a fibre bundle, or the space of bisections of a Lie groupoid, etc.

== Subductions and inductions ==
Analogously to the notions of submersions and immersions between manifolds, there are two special classes of morphisms between diffeological spaces. A subduction is a surjective function &quot;formula_72&quot; between diffeological spaces such that the diffeology of &quot;formula_44&quot; is the pushforward of the diffeology of &quot;formula_6&quot;. Similarly, an induction is an injective function &quot;formula_72&quot; between diffeological spaces such that the diffeology of &quot;formula_6 &quot;is the pullback of the diffeology of &quot;formula_44&quot;. Note that subductions and inductions are automatically smooth.

It is instructive to consider the case where &quot;formula_6&quot; and &quot;formula_44&quot; are smooth manifolds.

* Every surjective submersion formula_126 is a subduction.
* A subduction need not be a surjective submersion. One example is formula_127 given by formula_128.
* An injective immersion need not be an induction. One example is the parametrization of the &quot;figure-eight,&quot; formula_129 given by formula_130.
* An induction need not be an injective immersion. One example is the &quot;semi-cubic,&quot; formula_131given by formula_132.

In the category of diffeological spaces, subductions are precisely the strong epimorphisms, and inductions are precisely the strong monomorphisms. A map that is both a subduction and induction is a diffeomorphism.

<text>Methaqualone is a hypnotic sedative. It was sold under the brand names Quaalude ( ) and Sopor among others, which contained 300 mg of methaqualone, and sold as a combination drug under the brand name Mandrax, which contained 250 mg methaqualone and 25 mg diphenhydramine within the same tablet, mostly in Europe. Commercial production of methaqualone was halted in the mid-1980s due to widespread abuse and addictiveness. It is a member of the quinazolinone class.

== Medical use ==
The sedative–hypnotic activity of methaqualone was recognized in 1955. Its use peaked in the early 1970s for the treatment of insomnia, and as a sedative and muscle relaxant.

Methaqualone was not recommended for use while pregnant and is in pregnancy category D.

Similar to other GABAergic agents, methaqualone will produce tolerance and physical dependence with extended periods of use.

== Overdose ==

An overdose of methaqualone can lead to coma and death.
Additional effects are delirium, convulsions, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, vomiting, kidney failure, and death through cardiac or respiratory arrest. Methaqualone overdose resembles barbiturate poisoning, but with increased motor difficulties and a lower incidence of cardiac or respiratory depression.
The standard single tablet adult dose of Quaalude brand of methaqualone was 300 mg when made by Lemmon. A dose of 8000 mg is lethal and a dose as little as 2000 mg could induce a coma if taken with an alcoholic beverage.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Methaqualone primarily acts as a sedative, relieving anxiety and promoting sleep. Methaqualone binds to GABAA receptors, and it shows negligible affinity for a wide array of other potential targets, including other receptors and neurotransmitter transporters. Methaqualone is a positive allosteric modulator at many subtypes of GABAA receptor, similar to classical benzodiazepines such as diazepam. GABAA receptors are inhibitory, so methaqualone tends to inhibit action potentials, similar to GABA itself or other GABAA receptor agonists. Unlike most benzodiazepines, methaqualone acts as a negative allosteric modulator at a few GABAA receptor subtypes, which tends to cause an excitatory response in neurons expressing those receptors. Because methaqualone can be either excitatory or inhibitory depending on the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor, it can be characterized as a mixed GABAA receptor modulator. The methaqualone binding site is distinct from the benzodiazepine, barbiturate, and neurosteroid binding sites on the GABAA receptor complex, and it may partially overlap with the etomidate binding site.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Methaqualone peaks in the bloodstream within several hours, with a half-life of 20–60 hours. 

== History ==
Methaqualone was first synthesized in India in 1951 by Indra Kishore Kacker and Syed Husain Zaheer, who were conducting research on finding new antimalarial medications. In 1962, methaqualone was patented in the United States by Wallace and Tiernan. By 1965, it was the most commonly prescribed sedative in Britain, where it has been sold legally under the names Malsed, Malsedin, and Renoval. In 1965, a methaqualone/antihistamine combination was sold as the sedative drug Mandrax in Europe, by Roussel Laboratories (now part of Sanofi S.A.). In 1972, it was the sixth-bestselling sedative in the US, where it was legal under the brand name Quaalude.

Quaalude in the United States was originally manufactured in 1965 by the pharmaceutical firm William H. Rorer, Inc., based in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania. The drug name &quot;Quaalude&quot; is a portmanteau, combining the words &quot;quiet interlude&quot; and shared a stylistic reference to another drug marketed by the firm, Maalox.

In 1978, Rorer sold the rights to manufacture Quaalude to the Lemmon Company of Sellersville, Pennsylvania. At that time, Rorer chairman John Eckman commented on Quaalude&#x27;s bad reputation stemming from illegal manufacture and use of methaqualone, and illegal sale and use of legally prescribed Quaalude: &quot;Quaalude accounted for less than 2% of our sales, but created 98% of our headaches.&quot;

Both companies still regarded Quaalude as an excellent sleeping drug. Lemmon, well aware of Quaalude&#x27;s public image problems, used advertisements in medical journals to urge physicians &quot;not to permit the abuses of illegal users to deprive a legitimate patient of the drug&quot;. Lemmon also marketed a small quantity under another name, Mequin, so doctors could prescribe the drug without the negative connotations.

The rights to Quaalude were held by the JB Roerig &amp; Company division of Pfizer, before the drug was discontinued in the United States in 1985, mainly due to its psychological addictiveness, widespread abuse, and illegal recreational use.

A 2024 Hungarian investigative documentary reported on large-scale production and sales of the drug by the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic to the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. It asserts that a Hungarian state-owned company utilized connections to Colombian drug cartels to facilitate the sale of extraordinary amounts to the United States.

== Society and culture ==

Methaqualone became increasingly popular as a recreational drug and club drug in the late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as &quot;ludes&quot; or &quot;disco biscuits&quot; due to its widespread use during the popularity of disco in the 1970s, or &quot;sopers&quot; (also &quot;soaps&quot;) in the United States and Canada, and &quot;mandrakes&quot; and &quot;mandies&quot; in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. The substance was sold both as a free base and as a salt (hydrochloride).

=== Brand names ===
It was sold under the brand name Quaalude (sometimes stylized &quot;Quāālude&quot; in the United States and Canada), and Mandrax in the UK, South Africa, and Australia.

=== Regulation ===
Methaqualone was initially placed in Schedule I as defined by the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, but was moved to Schedule II in 1979.

In Canada, methaqualone is listed in Schedule III of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and requires a prescription, but it is no longer manufactured. Methaqualone is banned in India.

In the United States it was withdrawn from the market in 1983 and made a Schedule I drug in 1984.

=== Recreational ===

Methaqualone became increasingly popular as a recreational drug in the late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as &quot;ludes&quot; or &quot;sopers&quot; and &quot;soaps&quot; (&quot;sopor&quot; is a Latin word for sleep) in the United States and &quot;mandrakes&quot; and &quot;mandies&quot; in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.

The drug was more tightly regulated in Britain under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and in the U.S. from 1973. It was withdrawn from many developed markets in the early 1980s. In the United States it was withdrawn in 1983 and made a Schedule I drug in 1984. It has a DEA ACSCN of 2565 and in 2022 the aggregate annual manufacturing quota for the United States was 60 grams.

Mention of its possible use in some types of cancer and AIDS treatments has periodically appeared in the literature since the late 1980s. Research does not appear to have reached an advanced stage. The DEA has also added the methaqualone analogue mecloqualone (also a result of some incomplete clandestine syntheses) to Schedule I as ACSCN 2572, with a manufacturing quota of 30 g.

Gene Haislip, the former head of the Chemical Control Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told the PBS documentary program &quot;Frontline&quot;, &quot;We beat &#x27;em.&quot; By working with governments and manufacturers around the world, the DEA was able to halt production and, Haislip said, &quot;eliminated the problem&quot;. Methaqualone was manufactured in the United States under the name Quaalude by the pharmaceutical firms Rorer and Lemmon with the numbers 714 stamped on the tablet, so people often referred to Quaalude as 714&#x27;s, &quot;Lemmons&quot;, or &quot;Lemmon 7&#x27;s&quot;.

Methaqualone was also manufactured in the US under the trade names Sopor and Parest. After the legal manufacture of the drug ended in the United States in 1982, underground laboratories in Mexico continued the illegal manufacture of methaqualone throughout the 1980s, continuing the use of the &quot;714&quot; stamp, until their popularity waned in the early 1990s. Drugs purported to be methaqualone are in a significant majority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines.

Illicit methaqualone is one of the most commonly used recreational drugs in South Africa. Manufactured clandestinely, often in India, it comes in tablet form, but is smoked with marijuana. This method of ingestion is known as &quot;white pipe&quot;. It is popular elsewhere in Africa and in India.

=== Chemical weapon – Project Coast ===
Illegal efforts to weaponize methaqualone have occurred. During the 1980s, the apartheid regime in South Africa ordered the covert manufacture of a large amount of methaqualone at the front company Delta G Scientific Company, as part of a secret chemical weapons program known as Project Coast. Methaqualone was given the codename &quot;MosRefCat&quot; (Mossgas Refinery Catalyst). Details of this activity came to light during the 1998 hearings of the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

=== Sexual assault ===

Actor Bill Cosby admitted in a 2015 civil deposition to giving methaqualone to women before allegedly sexually assaulting them. Film director Roman Polanski was convicted in 1977 of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl after giving her alcohol and methaqualone.

=== Popular culture ===
Quaaludes are mentioned in the 1983 film &quot;Scarface&quot;, when Al Pacino&#x27;s character Tony Montana says, &quot;Another quaalude... she&#x27;ll love me again.&quot; The little white pills, referred to as &quot;ludes,&quot; get a cameo along with several other illicit drugs in the 1983 Baby Boomer drama, The Big Chill. Quaaludes are also referenced extensively in the 2013 film &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;. 

Parody glam rocker &quot;Quay Lewd&quot;, one of the costumed performance personae used by Tubes singer Fee Waybill, was named after the drug. Many songs also refer to quaaludes, including the following: David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; (&quot;Time, in quaaludes and red wine&quot;) and &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; (&quot;You got your cue line/And a handful of &#x27;ludes&quot;); &quot;Cosmic Doo Doo&quot; by the American country music singer-songwriter Blaze Foley (&quot;Got some quaaludes in their purse&quot;); &quot;That Smell&quot; by Lynyrd Skynyrd (&quot;Can&#x27;t speak a word when you&#x27;re full of &#x27;ludes&quot;); &quot;Flakes&quot; by Frank Zappa (&quot;(Wanna buy some mandies, Bob?)&quot;); &quot;Straight Edge&quot; by Minor Threat (&quot;Laugh at the thought of eating ludes&quot;); and &quot;Kind of Girl&quot; by French Montana (&quot;That high got me feelin&#x27; like the Quaaludes from &quot;Wolf of Wall Street&quot;&quot;). 

Season 18 of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; addresses Quaalude administration as a date rape drug in episode 9, &quot;Decline and Fall&quot;, which aired January 18, 2017. In True Detective season 1, Rust Cohle&#x27;s use of Quaaludes is briefly mentioned in several episodes.

It is also used by Patrick Melrose in Edward St Aubyn&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;Bad News&quot;.

In the 2024 film &quot;Maria&quot;, Maria Callas, played by Angelina Jolie, stuffs Mandrax into the pockets of her coats and bags so that she&#x27;ll be able to escape detection by her butler/guardian Ferruccio (Pierfrancesco Favino).

<doc id="159598" wikidata="Q1050875" url="?curid=159598" title="S-VHS">
<text>, the common initialism for Super VHS, is an improved version of the VHS (VHS standing for video home system) standard for consumer-level video recording. Victor Company of Japan introduced S-VHS in Japan in April 1987, with their JVC-branded HR-S7000 VCR, and in certain overseas markets soon afterward. By the end of 1987, the first S-VHS VCR models from other competitors included the Hitachi VT-2700A, Mitsubishi HS-423UR, Panasonic PV-S4764, RCA VPT-695HF, and Toshiba SV-950. It has been standardized as IEC 60774-3 and IEC 60774-4.

==Technical information==
Like VHS, the S-VHS format uses a &quot;color under A&quot; modulation scheme. S-VHS improves luminance (luma) resolution by increasing luminance bandwidth. Increased bandwidth is possible because of the increased luminance carrier from 3.4 megahertz (MHz) to 5.4 MHz. The luminance modulator &quot;bandwidth&quot; also is increased: in contrast to standard VHS&#x27;s frequencies of 3.8 MHz (synch tip) to 4.8 MHz (peak white), S-VHS uses 5.4 MHz synch tip and 7.0 MHz peak white. Increased luminance bandwidth produces a 60% improvement in luminance picture detail—a horizontal resolution of 420 vertical lines per picture height, versus VHS&#x27;s 240 lines. The often quoted horizontal resolution of &quot;over 400&quot; means S-VHS captures greater picture detail than even NTSC analog cable and broadcast TV, which is limited to about 330 television lines (TVL). In practice, when time-shifting TV programs on S-VHS equipment, the improvement over VHS is noticeable. Yet, the trained eye can easily spot the difference between live television and an S-VHS recording of it. This is because S-VHS does not improve other key aspects of the video signal, particularly the chrominance (chroma) signal. In VHS, the chroma carrier is both severely bandlimited and noisy, a limitation that S-VHS does not address. Lack of color resolution was a deficiency shared by S-VHS&#x27;s contemporaries, such as Hi8 and ED-Beta – all of which were limited to 0.4 megahertz or 30 TVL resolution.

In audio recording, S-VHS retains VHS&#x27;s conventional linear (baseband) and high fidelity (Hi-Fi) – Audio Frequency Modulation (AFM) soundtracks. Some professional S-VHS decks, and high end domestic S-VHS VCRs such as the Victor HR-Z1 can additionally record a pulse-code modulation (PCM) digital audio track (stereo 48 kHz), onto S-VHS tape along with normal video and Hi-Fi stereo and mono analog audio. 

This is performed by using a high carrier frequency of 3 MHz for the digital audio with O-QDPSK (Offset Quadrature Differential Phase Shift Keying) modulation and PCM encoding which is then recorded onto the same helical tracks as the video. This frequency is above those used for VHS Hi-Fi (1.7 MHz for the left channel, 1.8 MHz for the right channel) but below the luminance signal frequency for regular VHS of 3.4 MHz. The digital audio stream has a bit rate of 2.6 Mbps. O-QDPSK is based on QDPSK (Quadrature Differential Phase Shift Keying), also known as DQPSK (Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), and is very similar to it, except O-QDPSK signals are free from zero crossing; the signals never cross the 0 voltage point. Instead they are above and below the 0 voltage point. This type of digital audio requires a bandwidth of 500 KHz. It is also possible for this audio channel to have a carrier frequency of 2 MHz.

The bandwidth of S-VHS allows PAL recordings to contain Teletext data along with the normal video signal, which then can be displayed as an overlay of the conventional TV picture (though not on standard VHS machines). A suitably Teletext-equipped receiver/decoder (TV, PC card, etc.) displays the recorded Teletext data information as if the video were a television transmission being received at that moment.

===Hardware===

S-VHS video cassette recorders (VCRs) and cassette tapes are nearly identical in appearance and operation, and backward compatible with VHS. VHS VCRs cannot play back S-VHS recordings at all but can record onto an S-VHS tape in the basic VHS format. Newer VHS VCRs, depending upon their specification, offered a feature called &quot;S-VHS quasi-playback&quot; or &quot;Super Quasi-Play Back&quot;, abbreviated to SQPB. SQPB lets basic VHS players view (but not record) S-VHS recordings, though reduced to the lesser VHS quality. This feature is useful for viewing S-VHS camcorder recordings that use either the full-size S-VHS videotape cassette or the smaller S-VHS-C videotape cassette.

Later model S-VHS VCRs offered a recording option called S-VHS ET, which allowed SVHS VCRs to record on VHS tape. S-VHS ET is a further modification of the VHS standards that permitted near S-VHS quality recordings on more common and less expensive basic VHS tapes. S-VHS ET recordings can be viewed on most SQPB-equipped VHS VCRs and S-VHS VCRs.

To get the most benefit from S-VHS, a direct video connection to the monitor or TV is required, ideally via an S-Video connector and/or S-Video enabled SCART.

===Media===
In order to take advantage of the enhanced capabilities of the S-VHS system, i.e., for the best recordings and playback, an S-VHS VCR requires S-VHS video tape cassettes. These have a different oxide media formulation for higher magnetic coercivity. S-VHS video cassettes are sensed and identified by the video cassette recorder via a specific internal profile within a hole in the underside of the S-VHS video cassette body.

Videophiles were the first to theorize that since the only distinguishing feature of an S-VHS tape is a small 3 mm hole on the underside of the video cassette, it should be possible to use more common and inexpensive VHS tapes by duplicating that hole. However, S-VHS cassettes contain a higher grade and coercivity of tape stock to effectively record the higher video bandwidth offered by S-VHS.

S-VHS tapes can be used with VHS VCRs, but an S-VHS recording will not play back properly on a VHS VCR without SQPB (sound is usually reproduced correctly, but the picture quality will be poor).

===S-VHS ET===
JVC introduced an &quot;S-VHS ET&quot; (Super-VHS Expansion Technology) system on its S-VHS consumer decks, allowing the use of normal VHS tapes for S-VHS recording, by slightly modifying the S-VHS recording specs, while still retaining compatibility, so that S-VHS ET tapes could be played with non-ET S-VHS VCRs. In S-VHS ET mode, the recording circuit is altered with:
# Change of the W/D clip level (reducing the white clip level from 210% in SVHS to 190% in SVHS ET)
# Change of the main emphasis characteristics (changing the frequency responses)
# Change of the recording level (Y and C) and recording current

==Limited success==

Despite its designation as the logical successor to VHS, S-VHS did not come close to replacing VHS. Likewise, S-VHS rentals and movie sales did very poorly. A few pre-recorded movies were released to S-VHS, but poor market acceptance prompted studios to transition their high-end product from S-VHS to Laserdisc, and then onto DVD.

, consumer S-VHS VCRs were still available, but difficult to find in retail outlets. The largest VCR manufacturers, such as Matsushita and Mitsubishi, gradually moved to DVD recorders, and hard-disk based digital video recorders (DVRs). Combination DVD/VCR units rarely offered S-VHS format standard, only VHS. In the mainstream consumer camcorder market, MiniDV, DVD, and— eventually— solid-state memory-based camcorders replaced S-VHS-C camcorders. Digital camcorders generally outperform S-VHS-C units in most technical aspects: audio/video quality, recording time, lossless duplication, and form factor. The videotapes themselves are available, mostly by mail order or online, but are vanishingly rare in retail channels, and substantially more expensive than high-quality standard VHS media.

==Videography==

In the camcorder role, the smaller form S-VHS-C enjoyed limited success among home video users, competing with Hi8.

Full-size S-VHS was more popular in the amateur video industry, as it allowed for at least second-generation copies at reasonable quality, which was necessary for editing. JVC, Panasonic, Sony and Mitsubishi sold industrial S-VHS decks for amateur and semi-professional production use.

A number of colleges and universities used S-VHS as a teaching tool for students, as the tapes cost less and offered more recording time than Betacam SP tapes, and yet students could still be trained on professional-level equipment. In the US a number of local access TV stations, and in Canada local cable channels used S-VHS in the 1990s to record and playback local programs, such as city councils and Christmas parades. For most of these stations, while the U-Matics that they had been using were being phased out, but the digital video was still years away, S-VHS was used to record from the composite setups that were still in place for U-Matic production.

Some television stations used the S-VHS format, both for acquisition and subsequent studio editing, but the network studios largely avoided S-VHS, as descendants of the more expensive Betacam format had already become a de facto industry standard.

==S-VHS vs ED-Beta==

Shortly after the announcement of S-VHS, Sony responded with an announcement of Extended Definition Betamax (ED-Beta). S-VHS was JVC&#x27;s next-generation video format designed to dominate the competing Super Betamax format (which already offered better-than-VHS quality). Not to be outdone, Sony developed ED-Beta as their next-generation competitor to S-VHS.

In terms of video performance, ED-Beta offered even greater luminance bandwidth than S-VHS – 500 television lines (TVL) of horizontal resolution per picture height, versus S-VHS&#x27;s or Laserdisc&#x27;s 420 TVL; putting ED-Beta nearly on par with professional digital video formats (520 TVL). However, chroma performance was far less spectacular, as neither S-VHS nor ED-Beta exceeded 0.4 megahertz or ~30 TVL maximum, whereas NTSC broadcast has a chroma resolution of ~120 TVL, and DVD has a chroma resolution of ~240 TVL. S-VHS was used in some TV stations for inexpensive &quot;on the spot&quot; camcorder capture of breaking news, however, it was not suitable for multi-generational (studio) use.

In terms of audio performance, both VHS and Beta offered analog Hi-Fi stereos of outstanding quality. Rather than reinvent the wheel, both S-VHS and ED-Beta re-used the AFM schemes of their predecessors without change. Professional S-VHS decks did offer digital PCM audio, a feature not matched by ED-Beta decks. In PAL markets, depth multiplexed audio was used for both formats.

In the U.S. market, the mainstream consumer market had largely ignored the release of S-VHS. With the Betamax market already in sharp decline, a &quot;format war&quot; for the next generation of video simply did not materialize. Sony discontinued the ED-Beta product line in the U.S. market after less than two years, handing S-VHS a victory by default, if it can even be called that. (VHS decks continued to outsell S-VHS decks until the end of the VCR product life cycle.)

There is anecdotal evidence that some TV stations purchased ED-Beta equipment as a low-cost alternative to professional Betacam equipment, prompting speculation that Sony&#x27;s management took steps to prevent its consumer (ED-Beta) division from cannibalizing the sales of its more lucrative professional video division. Nevertheless, by the time of ED-Beta&#x27;s introduction, VHS had already won a decisive victory, and no amount of competition on behalf of ED-Beta could regain the home video market.

==Use for digital audio==

In 1991, Alesis introduced ADAT, an eight-track digital audio recording system that used S-VHS cassettes. An ADAT machine recorded eight tracks of uncompressed audio material in 16-bit (later 20-bit) resolution. The recording time was one-third of the cassette&#x27;s nominal playing time, e.g., a 120-minute S-VHS cassette held 40 minutes of eight-track audio.

Studer produced the V-Eight (manufactured and sold by Alesis as the M20) and the V-Twenty-Four digital multitrack recorders. These used S-VHS cassettes for 8-track and 24-track digital audio recording, at a significantly lower cost than their DASH reel-to-reel digital recorders. The videotape transports were made for Studer by Matsushita.

<doc id="159599" wikidata="Q483118" url="?curid=159599" title="Ben Affleck">
<text>Benjamin Géza Affleck (born August 15, 1972) is an American actor and filmmaker. His accolades include two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and three Golden Globes. Affleck began his career as a child when he starred in the PBS educational series &quot;The Voyage of the Mimi&quot; (1984–1988). He later appeared in the independent comedy &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993) and several Kevin Smith comedies, including &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (1997).

Affleck gained wider recognition when he and Matt Damon won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for writing &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), which they also starred in. He established himself as a leading man in studio films, including the disaster film &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998), the action crime thriller &quot;Reindeer Games&quot; (2000), the war drama &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), and the thriller &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; (2002). After a career downturn, Affleck made a comeback by portraying George Reeves in the biopic &quot;Hollywoodland&quot; (2006), winning the Volpi Cup for Best Actor.

His directorial debut, &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; (2007), which he also co-wrote, was well received. He then directed and starred in the crime drama &quot;The Town&quot; (2010) and the political thriller &quot;Argo&quot; (2012), both of which were critical and commercial successes. For the latter, Affleck won the BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Picture. Affleck then starred in the psychological thriller &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014) and played the superhero Batman in the DC Extended Universe (2016–2023). He starred in the thriller &quot;The Accountant&quot; (2016) and the sports drama &quot;The Way Back&quot; (2020). Affleck had supporting roles in the dramas &quot;The Last Duel&quot; (2021), &quot;The Tender Bar&quot; (2021) and &quot;Air&quot; (2023), the latter of which he also directed.

Affleck is the co-founder of the Eastern Congo Initiative, a grantmaking and advocacy-based nonprofit organization. He is a supporter of the Democratic Party. Affleck and Damon are co-owners of the production company Artists Equity and were also co-owners of Pearl Street Films.

==Early life==
Affleck was born Benjamin Géza Affleck-Boldt on August 15, 1972, in Berkeley, California. His family moved to Massachusetts when he was three, living in Falmouth, where his brother Casey was born, before settling in Cambridge. His mother, Christopher Anne &quot;Chris&quot; Boldt, was a Harvard-educated elementary school teacher. His father, Timothy Byers Affleck, was an aspiring playwright who was &quot;mostly unemployed&quot;. He worked sporadically as a carpenter, auto mechanic, bookie, electrician, bartender, and janitor at Harvard. In the mid-1960s, he had been an actor and stage manager with the Theater Company of Boston.

During Affleck&#x27;s childhood, his father had a self-described &quot;severe, chronic problem with alcoholism&quot;, and Affleck has recalled him drinking &quot;all day ... every day&quot;. His father was &quot;very difficult&quot;, and Affleck felt a sense of &quot;relief&quot; at the age of 11 when his parents divorced, and his father exited the family home. His father continued to drink heavily and eventually became homeless, spending two years living on the streets of Cambridge. When Affleck was 16, his father entered a rehabilitation facility in Indio, California. He lived at the facility for 12 years to maintain his sobriety and worked there as an addiction counselor.

Affleck was raised in a politically active, liberal household. He and his brother, Casey, were surrounded by people who worked in the arts; the boys regularly attended theater performances with their mother and were encouraged to make their own home movies. David Wheeler, a family friend, later remembered Affleck as a &quot;very bright and intensely curious&quot; child. The brothers auditioned for roles in local commercials and film productions because of their mother&#x27;s friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director, and Affleck first acted professionally at the age of seven. His mother saved his wages in a college trust fund and hoped her son would ultimately become a teacher, worrying that acting was an insecure and &quot;frivolous&quot; profession. When Affleck was 13, he filmed a children&#x27;s television program in Mexico. He learned to speak Spanish during a year spent traveling around the country with his mother and brother.

As a Cambridge Rindge and Latin high school student, Affleck acted in theater productions and was inspired by drama teacher Gerry Speca. He became close friends with fellow student Matt Damon, whom he had known since the age of eight. Although Damon was two years older, the pair had &quot;identical interests&quot; and both wanted to pursue acting careers. They traveled to New York together for acting auditions and saved money for train and airline tickets in a joint bank account. While Affleck had high SAT scores, he was largely an unfocused student with poor attendance. He spent a few months studying Spanish at the University of Vermont, chosen because of its proximity to his then-girlfriend, but he left after fracturing his hip while playing basketball. At 18, Affleck moved to Los Angeles, studying Middle Eastern affairs at Occidental College for a year and a half.

==Career==

===1981–1997: Child acting and &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;===

Affleck acted professionally throughout his childhood but, in his own words, &quot;not in the sense that I had a mom that wanted to take me to Hollywood or a family that wanted to make money from me ... I kind of chanced into something.&quot; He first appeared, at the age of seven, in an independent film, &quot;The Dark End of the Street&quot; (1981), directed by a family friend. His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the PBS children&#x27;s series &quot;The Voyage of the Mimi&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Second Voyage of the Mimi&quot; (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes. Affleck worked &quot;sporadically&quot; on &quot;Mimi&quot; from the age of eight to fifteen in both Massachusetts and Mexico. As a teenager, he appeared in the ABC after school special &quot;Wanted: A Perfect Man&quot; (1986), the television film &quot;Hands of a Stranger&quot; (1987), and a 1989 Burger King commercial.

After high school, Affleck moved briefly to New York in search of acting work. Later, while studying at Occidental College in Los Angeles, Affleck directed student films. As an actor, he had a series of &quot;knock-around parts, one to the next&quot;. He played Patrick Duffy&#x27;s son in the television film &quot;Daddy&quot; (1991), made an uncredited appearance as a basketball player in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; film (1992), and had a supporting role as a prep school student in &quot;School Ties&quot; (1992). He played a high school quarterback in the NBC television series &quot;Against the Grain&quot; (1993), and a steroid-abusing high school football player in &quot;&quot; (1994). Affleck&#x27;s most notable role during this period was as a high school bully in Richard Linklater&#x27;s cult classic &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993). Linklater wanted a likable actor for the villainous role, and, while Affleck was &quot;big and imposing&quot;, he was &quot;so smart and full of life ... I just liked him.&quot; Affleck later said Linklater was instrumental in demystifying the filmmaking process for him.

Affleck&#x27;s first starring film role was as an aimless art student in the college drama &quot;Glory Daze&quot; (1995), with Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarking that his &quot;affably mopey performance finds just the right balance between obnoxious and sad sack&quot;. He then played a bully in filmmaker Kevin Smith&#x27;s comedy &quot;Mallrats&quot; (1995) and became friends with Smith during the filming. Affleck had begun to worry that he would be relegated to a career of &quot;throwing people into their lockers&quot;, but Smith wrote him a lead role in the romantic comedy &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (1997). The film was Affleck&#x27;s breakthrough. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Affleck&#x27;s &quot;wonderful ease&quot; playing the role, combining &quot;suave good looks with cool comic timing&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described it as a &quot;wholesome and quick-witted&quot; performance. When Affleck starred as a recently returned Korean War veteran in the coming-of-age drama &quot;Going All the Way&quot; (1997), Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; found him &quot;excellent&quot;, while Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that his &quot;flair for comic self-doubt made a strong impression.&quot;
The success of 1997&#x27;s &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, which Affleck co-wrote and acted in, marked a turning point in his career. The screenplay originated in 1992 when Damon wrote a 40-page script for a playwriting class at Harvard University. He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him in front of the class and, when Damon later moved into Affleck&#x27;s Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge and drew from their own experiences. The screenplay was borne of their desire to create &quot;an acting reel&quot; for themselves. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994 when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from industry figures, including Rob Reiner and William Goldman. Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock about a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded Miramax to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by Gus Van Sant, and co-starring Damon, Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams.

On its release, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;smart and touching screenplay&quot;, while Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; found it &quot;funny, nonchalant, moving and angry&quot;. Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that Affleck brought &quot;a beautifully nuanced tenderness&quot; to his role as the working-class friend of Damon&#x27;s mathematical prodigy character. Affleck and Damon eventually won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has described this period of his life as &quot;dreamlike&quot;: &quot;It was like one of those scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, &#x27;$100 Million Box Office! Awards! He remains the youngest writer (at age 25) ever to win an Oscar for screenwriting.

===1998–2002: Leading man status===

&quot;Armageddon&quot;, released in 1998, established Affleck as a viable leading man for Hollywood studio films. &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; had not yet been released during the casting process and, after Affleck&#x27;s screen test, director Michael Bay dismissed him as &quot;a geek&quot;. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer convinced Bay that Affleck would be a star, but he was required to lose weight, become tanned, and get his teeth capped before filming began. The film, where he starred opposite Bruce Willis as a blue-collar driller tasked by NASA with stopping an asteroid from colliding with Earth, was a box office success. Daphne Merkin of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; remarked: &quot;Affleck demonstrates a sexy Paul Newmanish charm and is clearly bound for stardom.&quot;

Later in 1998, Affleck had a supporting role as an arrogant English actor in the period romantic comedy &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, starring his then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow. Lael Loewenstein of &quot;Variety&quot; remarked that Affleck &quot;does some of his very best work, suggesting that comedy may be his true calling,&quot; while Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found him &quot;very funny&quot;. &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, while the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Affleck then appeared as a small-town sheriff in the supernatural horror film &quot;Phantoms&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wondered why actors like Affleck and Peter O&#x27;Toole had agreed to appear in the &quot;junky&quot; film: &quot;Affleck&#x27;s thudding performance suggests he is reading his dialogue for the first time, directly from cue cards.&quot;

Affleck and Damon had an on-screen reunion in Kevin Smith&#x27;s religious satire &quot;Dogma&quot;, which premiered at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that the pair, playing fallen angels, &quot;bring great, understandable enthusiasm to Mr. Smith&#x27;s smart talk and wild imaginings&quot;. Affleck starred opposite Sandra Bullock in the romantic comedy &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; (1999), playing a groom whose attempts to get to his wedding are complicated by his free-spirited traveling companion. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; praised &quot;his winning ability to play against his good looks in a self-effacing comic turn&quot;. Affleck then appeared opposite Courtney Love in the little-seen ensemble comedy &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot; (1999).

Interested in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed John Frankenheimer throughout pre-production of the action thriller &quot;Reindeer Games&quot; (2000). Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having &quot;a very winning, likable quality about him. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a long time and he&#x27;s really one of the nicest.&quot; He starred opposite Charlize Theron as a hardened criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; enjoying the unexpected casting choice: &quot;Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night&#x27;s sleep. He&#x27;s game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of &quot;Reindeer Games&quot;.&quot; He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama &quot;Boiler Room&quot; (2000). A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt Affleck had merely &quot;traced over&quot; Alec Baldwin&#x27;s performance in &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;, while Peter Rainer of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; said he &quot;does a series of riffs on Baldwin&#x27;s aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next&quot;. He provided the voice of Joseph in the animated &quot;&quot;. In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama &quot;Bounce&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;understated intensity and exquisite detail&quot; of his performance: &quot;His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined &#x27;people person&#x27; who isn&#x27;t half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive.&quot;

Affleck reunited with director Michael Bay for the critically derided war drama &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001). Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;the blandly handsome Affleck couldn&#x27;t convince that he&#x27;d ever so much as been turned down for a date, much less lost the love of his life to his best friend&quot;. Affleck then parodied &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; with Damon and Van Sant in Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001), made a cameo in the comedy &quot;Daddy and Them&quot; (2001), and had a supporting role in the little-seen &quot;The Third Wheel&quot; (2002). He portrayed the CIA analyst Jack Ryan in the thriller &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; (2002). Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt he was miscast in a role previously played by both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin: &quot;Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role.&quot; Affleck had an &quot;amazing experience&quot; making the thriller &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; (2002), and later cited Roger Michell as someone he learned from as a director. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; described it as one of his &quot;most thoroughly wrought&quot; performances: &quot;The journey into a moral fog compels him to play more inwardly and thoughtfully than he ever has before.&quot;

Affleck became more involved with television and film production in the early 2000s. He and Damon had set up Pearl Street Films in 1998, named after the street that ran between their childhood homes. Their next production company LivePlanet, co-founded in 2000 with Sean Bailey and Chris Moore, sought to integrate the Internet into mainstream television and film production. LivePlanet&#x27;s biggest success was the documentary series &quot;Project Greenlight&quot;, aired on HBO and later Bravo, which focused on first-time filmmakers being given the chance to direct a feature film. &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002, 2004 and 2005. &quot;Push, Nevada&quot; (2002), created, written and produced by Affleck and Bailey, was an ABC mystery drama series that placed a viewer-participation game within the frame of the show. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the show&#x27;s &quot;nerve, imagination and clever writing&quot;, but Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; described it as a &quot;knock-off&quot; of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. The show was canceled by ABC after seven episodes due to low ratings. Over time, LivePlanet&#x27;s focus shifted from multimedia projects to more traditional film production. Affleck and his partners signed a film production deal with Disney in 2002; it expired in 2007.

===2003–2005: Career downturn and tabloid notoriety===
While Affleck had been a tabloid figure for much of his career, he was the subject of increased media attention in 2003 because of his relationship with Jennifer Lopez. By the end of the year, Affleck had become, in the words of &quot;GQ&quot;, the &quot;world&#x27;s most over-exposed actor&quot;. His tabloid fame coincided with a series of poorly received films.

The first of these was &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003), in which Affleck starred as the blind superhero. Affleck was a longtime comic book fan, and, in 1999, had written a foreword for Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Guardian Devil&quot; about his love for the character of Daredevil. The film was a commercial success, but received a mixed response from critics. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Affleck was &quot;lost&quot; in the role: &quot;Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role ... [Only his scenes with Jon Favreau have] a playful side that allows Mr. Affleck to show his generosity as an actor.&quot; In 2014, Affleck described &quot;Daredevil&quot; as the only film he regretted making. He next appeared as a low-ranking mobster in the romantic comedy &quot;Gigli&quot; (2003), co-starring Lopez. The film was almost uniformly panned, with Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarking that &quot;Affleck doesn&#x27;t have the chops or the charm to maneuver around (or past) bad material.&quot; Rex Reed of &quot;The Observer&quot; criticized the co-stars, writing that the film reminds the world how &quot;pathetically incompetent they both are in the only two things that matter in career longevity - craft and talent.&quot; Yet Affleck has repeatedly defended director Martin Brest since the film&#x27;s release, describing him as &quot;one of the really great directors&quot;. In his last film role of 2003, Affleck starred as a reverse engineer in the sci-fi thriller &quot;Paycheck&quot; (2003). Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked on Affleck&#x27;s &quot;self-deprecating charm&quot; and wondered why he could not find better scripts. Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found it &quot;almost unfair&quot; to critique Affleck, given that he &quot;had such a rough year&quot;.

Affleck&#x27;s poor critical notices continued in 2004 when he starred as a bereaved husband in the romantic comedy &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;, directed by longtime collaborator Smith. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Affleck as an actor &quot;whose talent has curdled as his tabloid notoriety has spread.&quot; Later that year, he starred opposite James Gandolfini in the holiday comedy &quot;Surviving Christmas&quot;. Holden noted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the film &quot;found a clever way to use Ben Affleck&#x27;s disagreeable qualities. The actor&#x27;s shark-like grin, cocky petulance and bullying frat-boy swagger befit his character.&quot; At this point, the quality of scripts offered to Affleck &quot;was just getting worse and worse&quot;, the negative press coverage &quot;really started to affect&quot; him, and he decided to take a career break. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published a piece on the downfall of Affleck&#x27;s career in late 2004. The article noted that, unlike film critics and tabloid journalists, &quot;few industry professionals seem to be gloating over Affleck&#x27;s travails&quot;.

===2006–2015: Emergence as a director===
Affleck began a career comeback in 2006 with his acclaimed performance as Superman actor George Reeves in the noir biopic &quot;Hollywoodland&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised &quot;an award-caliber performance ... This is feeling, nuanced work from an actor some of us had prematurely written off.&quot; Geoffrey Macnab of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said he &quot;beautifully&quot; captured &quot;the character&#x27;s curious mix of charm, vulnerability and fatalism&quot;. He was awarded the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. Also in 2006, he made a cameo in Smith&#x27;s &quot;Clerks II&quot;, starred in the little-seen &quot;Man About Town&quot; and had a minor role in the crime drama &quot;Smokin&#x27; Aces&quot;.

In 2007, Affleck made his feature film directorial debut with &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot;, a crime drama set in a working-class Boston neighborhood, starring his brother Casey as a private investigator searching for a young abductee. Affleck co‑wrote the screenplay, based on the book by Dennis Lehane, with childhood friend Aaron Stockard, having first mentioned his intention to adapt the story in 2003. It opened to enthusiastic reviews. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;sensitivity to real struggle&quot;, while Stephen Farber of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described it as &quot;thoughtful, deeply poignant, [and] splendidly executed&quot;.

While Affleck intended to &quot;keep a primary emphasis on directing&quot; going forward in his career, he acted in three films in 2009. In the ensemble romantic comedy &quot;He&#x27;s Just Not That Into You&quot;, the chemistry between Affleck and Jennifer Aniston was praised. Affleck played a congressman in the political thriller &quot;State of Play&quot;. Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; found him &quot;very good in the film&#x27;s silliest role,&quot; but David Edelstein of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; remarked of Affleck: &quot;He might be smart and thoughtful in life [but] as an actor his wheels turn too slowly.&quot; He had a supporting role as a bartender in the little-seen comedy film &quot;Extract&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described his performance as &quot;a goofball delight&quot;, while Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared it &quot;a real performance&quot;. In 2010, Affleck starred in &quot;The Company Men&quot; as a mid-level sales executive who is made redundant during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; declared that Affleck &quot;gives his best performance yet&quot;, while Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; found he &quot;nails Bobby&#x27;s plunge from hubris to humiliation&quot;.

Following the modest commercial success of &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot;, Warner Bros. developed a close working relationship with Affleck and offered him his choice of the studio&#x27;s scripts. He decided to direct the crime drama &quot;The Town&quot; (2010), an adaptation of Chuck Hogan&#x27;s novel &quot;Prince of Thieves&quot;. He also re-wrote the screenplay and starred in the film as a bank robber. The film became a surprise box office hit, and gained further critical acclaim for Affleck. A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised his &quot;skill and self-confidence as a serious director,&quot; while Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; noted: &quot;Affleck has the stuff of a real director. Everything is here. It&#x27;s an effective thriller, he works closely with actors, he has a feel for pacing.&quot; Also in 2010, Affleck and Damon&#x27;s production company, Pearl Street Films, signed a first-look producing deal at Warner Bros.

Affleck soon began work on his next directorial project, &quot;Argo&quot; (2012), for Warner Bros. Written by Chris Terrio and starring Affleck as a CIA operative, the film tells the story of the CIA plan to save six U.S. diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis by faking a production for a large-scale science fiction film. Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said the film offered &quot;further proof that we were wrong about Ben Affleck&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked: &quot;Affleck takes the next step in what looks like a major directing career ... He directs the hell out of it, nailing the quickening pace, the wayward humor, the nerve-frying suspense.&quot; A major critical and commercial success, &quot;Argo&quot; won the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture. The cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Affleck himself won the Golden Globe Award, Directors Guild of America Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Director, becoming the first director to win these awards without a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.

The following year, Affleck played a romantic lead in Terrence Malick&#x27;s experimental drama &quot;To the Wonder&quot;. Malick, a close friend of Affleck&#x27;s godfather, first met Affleck in the 1990s to offer advice about the plot of &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; enjoyed &quot;a performance of dignity and sensitivity,&quot; while &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Richard Brody described Affleck as &quot;a solid and muscular performer&quot; who &quot;conveys a sense of thoughtful and willful individuality&quot;. Affleck&#x27;s performance as a poker boss was considered a highlight of the poorly reviewed thriller &quot;Runner Runner&quot; (2013). Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that it was &quot;one killer of a character, and Affleck plays him like a Bach concerto – every note perfectly played.&quot;

He then pushed back production on his own directorial project to star as a husband accused of murder in David Fincher&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014). Fincher cast him partly because he understood what it felt like to be misrepresented by tabloid media: &quot;What many people don&#x27;t know is that he&#x27;s crazy smart, but since he doesn&#x27;t want that to get awkward, he downplays it. I think he learned how to skate on charm.&quot; David Edelstein of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; noted that Fincher&#x27;s controlled style of directing had a &quot;remarkable&quot; effect on Affleck&#x27;s acting: &quot;I never thought I&#x27;d write these words, but he carries the movie. He&#x27;s terrific.&quot; Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; found Affleck &quot;perfectly cast&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a tricky turn, requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness, and he nails it completely.&quot; In 2015, Affleck and Damon&#x27;s &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; was resurrected by HBO for one season.

===2016–2019: Batman and continued directing===

Given Affleck&#x27;s growing reputation as a filmmaker, his decision to star as Batman in the 2016 superhero film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; was regarded by Dave Itzkoff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a somewhat bewildering choice&quot;. Although the casting announcement was met with intense fan backlash, Affleck&#x27;s performance ultimately earned a positive reception. Andrew Barker of &quot;Variety&quot; found him &quot;a winningly cranky, charismatic presence,&quot; while Brian Truitt of &quot;USA Today&quot; enjoyed his &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;surprisingly emotional&quot; take on the character. Affleck reprised his role as Batman later that year, making a brief cameo appearance in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016). He starred as an autistic accountant in the action thriller &quot;The Accountant&quot; (2016), which was an unexpected commercial success. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; felt Affleck&#x27;s &quot;boy-next-door&quot; demeanor – &quot;so normal and non-actorly that most of his performances feel like watching one of your buddies up on screen&quot; – was &quot;a terrific fit&quot; for the role. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wondered why Affleck, &quot;looking appropriately dead-eyed and miserable,&quot; committed himself to the film.

&quot;Live by Night&quot;, which Affleck wrote, directed, co-produced, and starred in, was released in late 2016. Adapted from Dennis Lehane&#x27;s novel of the same name, the Prohibition-era gangster drama received largely unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65 million production budget. David Sims of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described it as &quot;a fascinating mess of a movie&quot; and criticized Affleck&#x27;s &quot;stiff, uncomfortable&quot; performance. He noted that one of the last action scenes &quot;is so wonderfully staged, its action crisp and easy to follow, that it reminds you what skill Affleck has with the camera&quot;. In October 2016, Affleck and Damon made a one-off stage appearance for a live reading of the &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; screenplay at New York&#x27;s Skirball Theater. The superhero film &quot;Justice League&quot;, in which Affleck returned as Batman, was released in 2017. He later described it as a &quot;difficult&quot; on-set experience. Snyder stepped down during filming due to the death of his daughter, the replacement director Joss Whedon&#x27;s treatment of actors was the subject of complaints, and Affleck himself was struggling with addiction issues. The film drew mixed opinions from critics; Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that Affleck &quot;looks like he&#x27;d rather be almost anywhere else but here.&quot;

Amidst an alcoholism relapse, Affleck did not work in 2017. He stepped down as director, writer and, ultimately, as the star of &quot;The Batman&quot;, saying he &quot;couldn&#x27;t crack it&quot; and no longer felt &quot;passionate&quot; about the story. Filming of the drug-trafficking thriller &quot;Triple Frontier&quot; was postponed by six months in order to accommodate his treatment for &quot;health issues&quot;. Upon &quot;Triple Frontier&quot; release in 2019, Rodrigo Perez of &quot;The Playlist&quot; remarked that director J.C. Chandor &quot;gets a lot of mileage out of the Sad Affleck narrative and perhaps both director and actor lean into the idea.&quot; Later in 2019, Affleck made a cameo appearance in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot;, having had little contact with Kevin Smith since the making of &quot;Clerks II&quot; in 2006. Affleck played a supporting role as a diplomat in Dee Rees&#x27;s political thriller &quot;The Last Thing He Wanted&quot; (2020). The Netflix movie, filmed in mid-2018, received negative reviews from critics, with Tomris Laffly of &quot;Variety&quot; describing Affleck&#x27;s performance as &quot;oddly removed&quot;.

Affleck&#x27;s starring role as a recovering alcoholic in the sports drama &quot;The Way Back&quot; (2020) was widely praised. The themes of the movie were &quot;close to home&quot; for Affleck. He relapsed during pre-production in 2018 and the movie was shot in the days after he left rehab; Affleck agreed to put his salary in escrow and was accompanied to set by a sober coach. Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; said it was hard to avoid the movie&#x27;s &quot;meta angle&quot;: &quot;Affleck handles his self-conscious task with a generous humility—giving a performance built not out of histrionics or big actor moments, but instead from the messy details of a man in a plateaued distress&quot;. David Sims of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; praised the &quot;subtlety&quot;, &quot;vulnerability&quot; and &quot;lumbering physicality&quot; of his performance, describing it as &quot;the rawest and most natural&quot; work of his career. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cinemas closed in the second week of the movie&#x27;s release and Warner Bros. made it available to view-on-demand earlier than scheduled. He received a Best Actor nomination at the 2021 Critics&#x27; Choice Awards. Also in 2021, Snyder&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Justice League&quot; featured a newly filmed scene with Affleck.

===2020–present: Supporting roles and Artists Equity===
Affleck had supporting roles in two 2021 releases. He played Peter II, Count of Alençon, a hedonistic aristocrat in Ridley Scott&#x27;s medieval drama &quot;The Last Duel&quot;; he also co-wrote the movie&#x27;s screenplay with Damon and Nicole Holofcener. Bilge Ebiri of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; was impressed by Affleck&#x27;s &quot;imperious&quot; performance as the &quot;wonderfully skeezy Pierre, a marvelously out-there creation who shouldn&#x27;t work at all and yet becomes an engine of uneasy delights.&quot; Brian Truitt of &quot;USA Today&quot; said he &quot;steals the movie&quot;: &quot;He seems to have written the most entertaining character in the movie for himself, but we&#x27;ll allow it.&quot; Later that year, Affleck appeared as a substitute father figure in George Clooney&#x27;s coming-of-age drama &quot;The Tender Bar&quot;. The film premiered at the London Film Festival, with Clooney remarking that he cast Affleck because he is &quot;very intelligent, and he can also come off as the big goomba.&quot; Pete Hammond of &quot;Deadline&quot; described it as &quot;a part he was born to play&quot;, writing that he &quot;beautifully and knowingly&quot; delivered &quot;an unforgettable portrait of the uncle you wish you had.&quot; Kevin Maher of &quot;The Times&quot; said he played the role with &quot;extraordinary subtly and depth&quot;: &quot;He dominates his every scene, with deftly delivered quips, comedy reaction shots or sheer hang-dog charisma alone.&quot; For the role, Affleck was nominated for the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In 2022, Affleck and Ana de Armas starred in Adrian Lyne&#x27;s thriller &quot;Deep Water&quot;, an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s novel. It was released on streaming service Hulu and received largely negative reviews. Justin Chang of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said Affleck &quot;excels at playing the emasculated dreamboat, the golden boy gone to seed.&quot; Adam Nayman of &quot;The Ringer&quot; said the film &quot;serves as an example of his formidable skill set within a very specific range&quot;: &quot;What used to seem like the callow cockiness of a handsome front-runner has hardened—and deepened—into a kind of grizzled charisma, the gravitas of a frat boy facing down his own expiration date.&quot; He also made a cameo appearance in Smith&#x27;s &quot;Clerks III&quot;.

Affleck&#x27;s fifth directorial project, &quot;Air&quot;, about Nike&#x27;s signing of Michael Jordan, premiered at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival to critical acclaim; it was given a wide theatrical release by Amazon Studios in April, then offered for streaming on Amazon Prime. Affleck portrayed the supporting role of Phil Knight, while other cast members include Matt Damon, Viola Davis, Chris Tucker, and Jason Bateman. It marked the first release from Affleck and Damon&#x27;s independent production company Artists Equity, which aims to share profits with all stakeholders. Affleck serves as the company&#x27;s CEO and intends to work exclusively for Artists Equity as a filmmaker.

Affleck starred as a detective in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Hypnotic&quot;, which was released in theaters in May 2023. He made a cameo appearance as Batman in the film &quot;The Flash&quot; released in June 2023 and was also set to reprise the role for &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot; before his scenes in the film were deleted. Artists Equity entered into a strategic partnership with Chris Hemsworth&#x27;s Wild State production company on film and television projects in December 2023.

==Philanthropy==

===Eastern Congo Initiative===

After traveling in the region between 2007 and early 2010, Affleck and Whitney Williams co-founded the nonprofit organization Eastern Congo Initiative in 2010. ECI acts as a grant maker for Congolese-led, community-based charities. It offers training and resources to cooperatives of Congolese farmers while leveraging partnerships with companies including Theo Chocolate and Starbucks. ECI also aims to raise public awareness and drive policy change in the United States.

Affleck has written op-eds about issues facing eastern Congo for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Politico&quot;, the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. He has appeared as a discussion panelist at many events, including at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Global Philanthropy Forum, and the Clinton Global Initiative. During visits to Washington D.C., Affleck has testified before the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights, the House Armed Services Committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Projects.

===Other charitable causes===
Affleck is a supporter of the A-T Children&#x27;s Project. While filming &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; in 1998, Affleck befriended ten-year-old Joe Kindregan (1988–2015), who had the rare disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), and his family. He became actively involved in fundraising for A-T, and he and Kindregan testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health &amp; Human Services, and Education in 2001, asking senators to support stem-cell research and to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health. In 2007, Affleck was the keynote speaker at Kindregan&#x27;s high school graduation ceremony in Fairfax, Virginia. Kindregan appeared as an extra in &quot;Argo&quot; (2012). In 2013, in celebration of Kindregan&#x27;s 25th birthday and &quot;15 years of friendship with Joe and his family,&quot; Affleck and Garner matched donations made to the A-T Children&#x27;s Project. Affleck appeared in &quot;CinemAbility&quot; (2013), a documentary film which explores Hollywood&#x27;s portrayals of people with disabilities.

As part of USO-sponsored tours, Affleck visited marines stationed in the Persian Gulf in 2003, and troops at Germany&#x27;s Ramstein Air Base in 2017. He is a supporter of Paralyzed Veterans of America. He filmed public service announcements for the organization in both 2009 and 2014. He has also volunteered on behalf of Operation Gratitude.

Affleck spoke at a Feeding America rally in Washington D.C. in 2009, and filmed a public service announcement for the charity in 2010. Affleck and Ellen DeGeneres launched Feeding America&#x27;s Small Change Campaign in 2011. Also that year, he and Howard Graham Buffett co-wrote an article for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, highlighting the &quot;growing percentage of the food insecure population that is not eligible for federal nutrition programs&quot;. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Affleck organized an online celebrity poker tournament to benefit the charity, made a personal donation and urged others to support the cause.

Affleck is a supporter of the Los Angeles-based homelessness charity Midnight Mission, having volunteered at and donated to the charity. He has also volunteered at Atlanta Mission.

==Political views==
Affleck has described himself as &quot;moderately liberal.&quot; He was raised in &quot;a very strong union household&quot;. In 2000, he spoke at a rally at Harvard University in support of an increased living wage for all workers on campus; his father worked as a janitor at the university. He later narrated a documentary, &quot;Occupation&quot; (2002), about a sit-in organized by the Harvard Living Wage Campaign. Affleck and Senator Ted Kennedy held a press conference on Capitol Hill in 2004, pushing for an increase in the minimum wage. He spoke at a 2007 press conference at Boston&#x27;s City Hall in support of SEIU&#x27;s unionization efforts for the city&#x27;s low-paid hospital workers. During the Writers&#x27; Strike in 2008, Affleck voiced support for the picketers.

Affleck is pro-choice. In a 2000 interview, he stated that he believes &quot;very strongly in a woman&#x27;s right to choose&quot;. In 2012, he supported the Draw the Line campaign, describing reproductive rights as &quot;fundamental&quot;.

Affleck was a longtime supporter of legalizing gay marriage, saying in 2004 that he hoped to look back on the marriage debate &quot;with some degree of embarrassment for how antiquated it was&quot;. Also that year, he remarked that it was &quot;outrageous and offensive&quot; to suggest members of the transgender community were not entitled to equal rights. He appeared alongside his gay cousin in a 2005 Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays print advertising campaign.

Affleck appeared at a press conference with New York Senator Chuck Schumer in 2002, in support of a proposed Anti-Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act. In 2003, he criticized the &quot;questionable and aggressive&quot; use of the Patriot Act and the resulting &quot;encroachments on civil liberties&quot;. A reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; overheard Affleck denouncing the Israeli invasion of Gaza at a Washington party in 2009. Steven Clemons, a participant in the conversation, said Affleck listened &quot;to alternative takes ... What Affleck spoke about that night was reasoned, complex and made a lot of sense.&quot; Later that year, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, Affleck remarked that his views were closer to those of the Israeli Labor Party than Likud.

Affleck criticized the Bush tax cuts on many occasions. In 2007, he filmed a public service announcement for Divided We Fail, a nonpartisan AARP campaign seeking affordable, quality healthcare for all Americans.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Affleck expressed concern about conspiracy theories claiming Barack Obama was an Arab or a Muslim: &quot;This prejudice that we have allowed to fester in this campaign ... the acceptance of both of those things as a legitimate slur is really a problem.&quot; In 2012, he praised Senator John McCain&#x27;s leadership in defending Huma Abedin against anti-Muslim attacks. Affleck engaged in a discussion about the relationship between liberal principles and Islam during a 2014 appearance on &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;. In a 2017 &quot;Guardian&quot; interview, he said: &quot;I strongly believe that no one should be stereotyped on the basis of their race or religion. It&#x27;s one of the most fundamental tenets of liberal thought.&quot;

Affleck supports the Second Amendment, and said in 2012 that he owned several guns, both for skeet shooting and for the protection of his family. In 2020, he said trips to gun ranges as a young adult made him &quot;uncomfortable to remember ... given the subsequent tragedies with young people and guns.&quot;

Affleck appeared alongside then-Senator Barack Obama at a 2006 rally in support of Proposition 87, which sought to reduce petroleum consumption in favor of alternative energy. He appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund in 2007. Also that year, Affleck admitted he was not &quot;particularly good at being green&quot; while, in 2014, he named &quot;a 1966 Chevelle&quot; as his guilty pleasure. In 2016, Affleck filmed an endorsement for Rezpect Our Water, an online petition to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Affleck registered to vote as a Democrat in 1992, and has campaigned on behalf of several Democratic presidential nominees. He supported Al Gore in the final weeks of the 2000 presidential campaign, attending rallies in California, Pennsylvania, and Florida. However, Affleck was unable to vote due to a registration issue in New York City, where he was residing at the time, and later joked, &quot;I&#x27;m going to vote twice next time, in true Boston fashion.&quot;
Affleck was involved in the 2004 presidential campaign of John Kerry. During the Democratic National Convention in Boston, he spoke to many delegations, appeared on political discussion shows, and attended fundraising events. Affleck took part in a voter registration public service announcement, and traveled with Kerry during the opening weekend of his Believe in America Tour, making speeches at rallies in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio.

Affleck campaigned for President Barack Obama. He appeared alongside the then-Senator at a 2006 rally, introducing him as &quot;the most galvanizing leader to come out of either party, in my opinion, in at least a decade&quot;. He donated to Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2007, and hosted two fundraisers for the candidate during the 2008 Democratic Primary. Affleck urged voters to &quot;help make history&quot; in a MoveOn.org campaign, and made several appearances during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In the week of the presidential election, he appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to jokingly endorse Senator John McCain. Affleck did not actively campaign for Obama&#x27;s reelection in 2012, though he still supported him.

Affleck supported Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 presidential election campaign. He first met Clinton at Camp David in 1998, and, when she was a Senate candidate in 2000, he introduced her at a Cornell University rally and helped fundraise for her campaign. Affleck pointed to the First Lady&#x27;s work with children, women and &quot;working families&quot;. He supported Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary, noting that Clinton had &quot;moved toward the center&quot; during the campaign. Affleck donated to Clinton&#x27;s campaign fund during the 2016 Democratic Primary. During the 2016 presidential election, Affleck recorded a New Hampshire voter public service announcement, and was named by the Clinton campaign as a &quot;Hillblazer&quot; – one of 1,100 individuals who had contributed or raised at least $100,000. OpenSecrets reported that he raised $149,028.

During the latter stages of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Affleck said during an interview conducted in Spanish: &quot;I like Bernie, I like Biden, I like Warren but the thing is that most of all; I don&#x27;t like Trump.&quot; When Biden became the Democratic candidate, he donated to his campaign fund.

In 2002, Affleck donated to Dick Gephardt&#x27;s Congressional campaign, Robert Reich&#x27;s campaign for Governor of Massachusetts, and appeared in campaign literature for former classmate Marjorie Decker, running as a city councilor in Massachusetts. He made donations to the presidential campaigns of both Dennis Kucinich and Wesley Clark in 2003. In 2005, he donated to the campaign fund of Deval Patrick, a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts. In 2006, Affleck contributed to Cory Booker&#x27;s Newark mayoral campaign, to Eliot Spitzer&#x27;s New York gubernatorial campaign, and introduced Congressmen Joe Courtney and Chris Murphy at rallies in Connecticut. He donated to the 2008 Congressional campaign of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Patrick Murphy, and to the 2010 Senate campaign of Kirsten Gillibrand. Affleck hosted a 2012 fundraiser for Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren, endorsed her in a Progressive Change Campaign Committee video, and made a campaign donation. In 2013, he hosted a fundraiser for Cory Booker, and made donations to the Senate campaigns of both Booker and Alison Lundergan Grimes. In 2014, he donated to Bobby Shriver&#x27;s Los Angeles County Supervisor campaign, and to Prophet La&#x27;omar Walker&#x27;s California State Assembly campaign. He donated to the campaign of Senate candidate Kamala Harris in 2015 and, in 2016, he donated to the Congressional campaign of Melissa Gilbert and the West Virginia Senate campaign of Corey Palumbo. In 2017, he donated to the Senate reelection campaigns of Elizabeth Warren and Chris Coons, and to Adam Schiff&#x27;s Congressional campaign. In 2018, he made contributions to the Congressional campaigns of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sharice Davids and Leann Jacobsen, and to Michigan gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. In 2019, Affleck donated to the presidential campaigns funds of both Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, and hosted a fundraiser for Booker. Also in 2019, he contributed to the congressional campaign funds of both Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. In 2020, he spoke at a virtual rally in support of Whitney Williams, a candidate in the 2020 Montana gubernatorial election, and donated to her campaign fund.

In the early 2000s, Affleck often expressed an interest in running for political office one day, but since 2007, he has denied any political ambitions and spoken repeatedly about the need for campaign finance reform. In 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Virginia Democrats were trying to persuade Affleck to run as a Senate candidate. His publicist dismissed the rumor. In 2012, political pundits and Democratic strategists including Bob Shrum and Tad Devine speculated that Affleck was considering running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. Affleck denied the rumor, and joked that he &quot;also won&#x27;t be throwing my hat in the ring to run the UN&quot;.

In October 2023, Affleck signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter calling for a ceasefire during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

==Personal life==

===Relationship with Jennifer Garner===

Affleck was married to actress Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018. They began dating in August 2004, having established a friendship on the sets of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001) and &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003). They were married on June 29, 2005, in a private Turks and Caicos ceremony. Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his partner, Rainer Andreesen, were the only guests. Affleck and Garner have three children together.

They publicly announced their separation in June 2015, with Affleck continuing to live in a guesthouse at the family home until mid-2017. They jointly filed for divorce in April 2017, seeking joint physical and legal custody of their children. They jointly hired a mediator to help them negotiate a financial settlement and the divorce was finalized in October 2018. In 2020, Affleck described the divorce as &quot;the biggest regret of my life&quot; and &quot;a painful experience, even if you&#x27;re on the best possible terms and you agree it&#x27;s the best choice.&quot;

While Affleck believes paparazzi attention is &quot;part of the deal&quot; of stardom, he has spoken out against photographs taken at his private residence and paparazzi interest in his children specifically, who he says became the &quot;big money&quot; draw for photographers waiting outside his home. In 2013, Affleck and Garner hosted an event for lawmakers at their home in support of a bill that would protect celebrities&#x27; children from harassment by photographers; their six-year-old daughter made a speech about her personal experiences. Garner also testified before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of the bill, which later became law. Despite the legislation, photographers still regularly wait outside their children&#x27;s school and police assistance is sometimes required. In 2014, Affleck argued in favor of United Kingdom-style legislation that requires media outlets to blur children&#x27;s faces in published photos. He has said there are &quot;real practical dangers&quot; involved in paparazzi attention, citing Garner&#x27;s longtime stalker, Steven Burky, who was arrested in December 2009 while trying to blend in with paparazzi outside their daughter&#x27;s preschool. Burky was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California&#x27;s state mental hospital, and ordered to stay away from the Affleck-Garner family for 10 years if released.

===Relationship with Jennifer Lopez===
Affleck first dated Jennifer Lopez from 2002 to 2004. They became friends on the set of &quot;Gigli&quot; in December 2001, having previously encountered each other at industry parties. They began a romantic relationship in July 2002 when Lopez filed for divorce from her second husband, Cris Judd. Their relationship was extensively publicized, with tabloids referring to the couple as Bennifer, the first celebrity portmanteau of its kind. They appeared together in the music video for her song &quot;Jenny from the Block&quot; and the film &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;. Lopez&#x27;s album &quot;This Is Me... Then&quot; was dedicated to and inspired by Affleck. They became engaged in November 2002 but their planned wedding on September 14, 2003, was postponed with four days&#x27; notice because of &quot;excessive media attention&quot;. They called off the engagement in January 2004.

Affleck and Lopez remained in occasional contact in the years after their breakup and spoke highly of each other in public. According to Lopez, Affleck&#x27;s discomfort with the media scrutiny was one reason for their split and, years later, she described it as her &quot;first real heartbreak&quot;: &quot;I think different time, different thing, who knows what could&#x27;ve happened but there was a genuine love there.&quot;
Both during the relationship and in the months after the breakup, Affleck characterized some of the media commentary as rooted in racism, classism, and sexism: &quot;We were thought of as two different kinds of people.&quot; In subsequent years, he pushed back against the &quot;curious notion&quot; that he should view the relationship as a mistake, and reflected on the prevailing tabloid culture at the time &quot;where it&#x27;s about one person and everybody focuses on them.&quot; Affleck acknowledged that &quot;there were ways I did contribute to it&quot;, citing the &quot;Jenny from the Block&quot; music video and a joint promotional interview for &quot;Gigli&quot;. He said neither of them &quot;anticipated&quot; the degree of attention they would receive: &quot;I think Jen and I made a mistake in that we fell in love, we were excited and maybe too accessible.&quot;

Affleck and Lopez began dating again in April 2021, 20 years after they had first met, and announced their second engagement in April 2022. They were married in a Las Vegas ceremony on July 16, 2022, and hosted a larger celebration for family and friends at Affleck&#x27;s Georgia house later that summer. Affleck is stepfather to Lopez&#x27;s twins. The couple separated on April 26, 2024, and Lopez filed for divorce from Affleck on August 20, 2024. The divorce was finalized on February 21, 2025.

===Other relationships===
Affleck began dating actress Gwyneth Paltrow in October 1997 after they met at a Miramax dinner, and they later worked together on &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998). Although they first broke up in January 1999, months later, Paltrow persuaded Affleck to co-star with her in &quot;Bounce&quot; (2000) and they soon resumed their relationship. They separated again in October 2000. In 2015, Paltrow said they were friends.

Affleck had a long-distance relationship with New York-based television producer Lindsay Shookus from mid-2017 to mid-2018; they briefly dated again in early 2019. Shookus served as the head of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s talent department at the time, a show which Affleck has hosted five times since 2000. Affleck dated Cuban actress Ana de Armas, whom he met on the set of &quot;Deep Water&quot; in the fall of 2019, from early 2020 to early 2021.

===Health===
Affleck has both anxiety and depression, and has taken antidepressants since age 26. He is a recovering alcoholic and follows a 12-step program. He said he used alcohol to alleviate a constant feeling of &quot;discomfort&quot; and remarked that it &quot;took me a long time to fundamentally, deeply, without a hint of doubt, admit to myself that I am an alcoholic.&quot;

There is a history of addiction and mental illness in Affleck&#x27;s family. Two of his grandparents were alcoholics. His paternal grandmother, addicted to both alcohol and barbiturates, died by suicide at age 46. His paternal uncle was an addict who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His aunt was a heroin addict. Affleck attended Al-Anon support meetings as a child due to his father&#x27;s addiction issues. His brother Casey is also a recovering alcoholic.

Affleck became sober in his mid-twenties, stating in a 1998 interview that alcohol was &quot;dangerous&quot; for him. He received residential treatment for addiction in 2001 and maintained his sobriety for a &quot;couple of years&quot; afterward. In subsequent years, he refused to discuss his alcoholism in detail and later described it as a period where he &quot;drank relatively normally&quot;. &quot;I thought, &#x27;I want to just drink like a normal person. I want to have wine at dinner.&#x27; And I was able to for about eight years.&quot; Affleck gradually began to drink &quot;more and more&quot; and eventually, was drinking until he &quot;passed out&quot; on a nightly basis. Garner supported Affleck&#x27;s struggles with alcoholism during and after their marriage and said in 2020 that attending Al-Anon meetings empowered her to change &quot;the dance&quot; of their relationship. Affleck returned to residential treatment in 2017 and following a publicly documented relapse and intervention, again in 2018. He received further outpatient treatment over the following year. In late 2019, TMZ filmed him stumbling on a Los Angeles street; he acknowledged the following day that he had a brief &quot;slip&quot; after over a year of sobriety. He later described the incident as &quot;embarrassing&quot;: &quot;I wish it didn&#x27;t happen. I really wish it wasn&#x27;t on the internet for my kids to see.&quot;

During press for &quot;The Way Back&quot; (2020), in which he plays an alcoholic, Affleck stressed that he felt &quot;vulnerable&quot; when talking about his addiction and did not intend to &quot;go on talking about this issue forever&quot;: &quot;I think the value, if there is value in me talking about being a recovering alcoholic, is that that doesn&#x27;t have to be who you are. That doesn&#x27;t have to be the label on your head.&quot; In 2023, he said he often advises fellow actors to avoid speaking publicly about their addiction issues where possible: &quot;You don&#x27;t need to be anybody&#x27;s poster child.&quot; 

===Professional gambling===

Affleck won the 2004 California State Poker Championship, taking home the first prize of $356,400 and qualifying for the 2004 World Poker Tour final tournament. He was one of many celebrities, along with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire, who took part in Molly Bloom&#x27;s high-stakes poker games in the mid-2000s. In 2014, Affleck was asked to refrain from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, after a series of wins aroused suspicion that he was counting cards, which is a legal gambling strategy, though frowned upon by casinos. Affleck has repeatedly denied tabloid reports of a gambling addiction.

===Religious beliefs===
Affleck came from an Episcopalian family, but was not raised in a religious household. In 2008, he listed the Gospel of Matthew as one of the books that made a difference in his life. As infants, each of his three children were baptized as members of the United Methodist Church and, from 2015 to 2020, Affleck, Garner and their children were regularly photographed at Methodist church services in Los Angeles.

Affleck is agnostic and has described faith as a &quot;struggle&quot;: &quot;But the twelve-step program is faith-based ... Faith has served me well in recovery as an alcoholic.&quot; He identifies more with the teachings of Buddhism: &quot;I have a difficult time with the theistic aspects of AA ... One of the things I like about Buddhism is it&#x27;s like, believe what you believe.&quot;

===Ancestry===
Much of Affleck&#x27;s ancestry is English, Welsh, Scottish and German with a smattering of Irishness. Affleck&#x27;s said-to-be maternal great-great-grandfather, , who, aged 12, accidentally discovered the Curmsun Disc, emigrated from Prussia in the late 1840s.

Affleck appeared on the PBS genealogy series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; in 2014. When told that an ancestor had been a slave owner in Georgia, Affleck responded: &quot;God. It gives me kind of a sagging feeling to see a biological relationship to that. But, you know, there it is, part of our history ... We tend to separate ourselves from these things by going like, &#x27;It&#x27;s just dry history, and it&#x27;s all over now&#x27;.&quot; Leaked emails from the 2015 Sony email hacking scandal showed that, after filming, Affleck felt uncomfortable about the segment, which was not included in the final broadcast. The show&#x27;s host, professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., stated: &quot;We focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry.&quot; An internal investigation by PBS concluded that Affleck had exerted &quot;improper influence&quot; over the editorial process and that the producers of the show, including Gates, had violated PBS standards by improperly withholding information. The show was temporarily postponed, resuming after a fact-checker and an &quot;independent genealogist&quot; were added to the show&#x27;s staff. Affleck&#x27;s episode was removed from the show&#x27;s online archive.

In 2009, the New England Historic Genealogical Society discovered that Affleck is an 11th cousin of the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama.

===Me Too allegations===
During the Me Too movement in 2017, Affleck was accused by two women of inappropriate behavior. Actress Hilarie Burton stated that, during an on-air appearance on &quot;TRL Uncensored&quot; in 2003, Affleck &quot;wraps his arm around me, and comes over and tweaks my left boob&quot;. Affleck responded on Twitter: &quot;I acted inappropriately toward Ms. Burton and I sincerely apologize.&quot; Annamarie Tendler, a makeup artist, said that Affleck &quot;grabbed my ass at a Golden Globes party in 2014 ... He tried to play it like he was politely moving me out of the way.&quot;

In response to the allegations of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein, Affleck pledged to donate any future profits from his early Miramax films to charities supporting victims of sexual assault, and said he had only been aware that Weinstein &quot;was sleazy and a bully.&quot; In a tweet, actress Rose McGowan responded: &quot;You lie.&quot; She said she met Affleck after being sexually assaulted by Weinstein during the Sundance Film Festival in 1997 and told him, while crying, that she had &quot;just come from Harvey&#x27;s and he said, &#x27;Goddamnit, I told him to stop doing that.&#x27;&quot; In a leaked email regarding McGowan&#x27;s case, Affleck stated: &quot;I never saw Rose at any hotel in Sundance. She never told me nor did I ever infer that she was attacked by anyone.&quot; In a 2019 interview, Affleck said: &quot;I don&#x27;t really want to get into other people&#x27;s individual stories because I feel like those are their stories and they&#x27;re entitled to tell as much or as little of those as they want. I believe Rose. I support her. I really like and admire her tenacity and I wish her the best.&quot; In 2020, McGowan clarified her comments: &quot;It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m raging at Ben Affleck. I never said to him, &#x27;I was just raped.&#x27; It&#x27;s just more to illustrate the point of this continual thing of everybody knowing and everybody being part of it, unwittingly or proactively.&quot;

==Filmography and awards==

Affleck has appeared in more than 50 films and won many accolades throughout his career as an actor, writer, and director. He first gained recognition as a writer when he won the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), which he co-wrote with Matt Damon; Affleck remains the youngest person ever to win a Best Original Screenplay Oscar, at 25 years old. As an actor, he received Golden Globe nominations for his performances in &quot;Hollywoodland&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Tender Bar&quot; (2021). The film &quot;Argo&quot; (2012), which he directed, co-produced, and starred in, won him the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA, and Directors Guild Award for Best Director, as well as the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA, the Producers Guild Award, and the Academy Award for Best Picture.

<text>Tourism in Belgium is one of Belgium&#x27;s industries. Its accessibility from elsewhere in Europe makes it a popular tourist destination. The tourist industry generates 2.8% of Belgium&#x27;s gross domestic product and employs 3.3% of the working population (142,000 people). 6.7 million people travelled to Belgium in 2005. Two-thirds of them come from the larger nearby countries - France, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Germany; there are also many tourists from Spain and Italy.

Like many national institutions in Belgium, the national tourist agencies are split along regional lines with two tourist agencies. They are the Belgian Tourist Office Brussels &amp; Wallonia for the regions of Wallonia and Brussels Capital-Region, and Toerisme Vlaanderen covering Flanders, although it covers Brussels as well.

In 1993, 2% of the total workforce was employed in tourism, less than in many neighbouring countries. Much of the tourism industry is located either on the heavily developed coastline or in the Ardennes. Brussels and the Flemish cities of Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, Leuven, and Mechelen, the Flemish &quot;Cities of Art&quot;, attract many cultural tourists. Much tourism in Brussels is business tourism.

Belgium was ranked 21st on the World Economic Forum&#x27;s 2017 &quot;Travel and Tourism Competitiveness report&quot;. The country was placed 4th for &quot;health and hygiene&quot; and 6th for &quot;ground and port infrastructure&quot;, but only 105th in the world for &quot;price competitiveness&quot; and 122nd for &quot;natural resources&quot;. In recent years, the number of international tourists has exponentially grown as key figures shown by Tourisme Vlaanderen.
